 1. Introduction
With the industrial and technological growth, development of harder and difficult-to-machine materials which find wide appli-cations in aerospace, nuclear engineering and other industries has been witnessed in the past few decades. These newly developed materials possess high strength-to-weight ratio, hardness and heat resistance qualities. Due to stringent design requirements, machining and shaping of these emerging materials becomes very difficult and costly by the conventional machining processes such as turning, milling, broaching, grinding, etc., which involve cut-ting tool to remove the material from the workpiece. Various problems occurred with these conventional machining techni-ques are high tool wear rate and heat generation at the tool and work piece interface and subsequent alteration of work piece material characteristics, etc. A rigidity requirement for the tool is also a major problem in the conventional machining of small and deep holes, complex surfaces and shapes. As a result, manufac-turers and design engineers are shifting to modern machining processes.

The modern machining processes are also referred as non-traditional in the sense that they do not employ traditional tools for metal removal and instead they directly use other forms of energy. These machining processes utilize electrical, chemical and optimal sources of energy to form and cut the materials. The problems of high complexity in shape, size and higher demand for product accuracy and surface finish, can also be solved through the modern machining processes.

Large number of modern machining processes are available in the industries such as ultrasonic machining, laser beam machin-ing, abrasive jet machining, electrical discharge machining, wire cut electric discharge machining, chemical machining, electro-chemical machining, plasma arc machining, etc., and each process posses its own advantages and limitations. Out of these various processes, some modern machining processes such as ultrasonic machining, abrasive jet machining and wire cut electric discharge machining are widely used in industries because of their faster metal removal rate along with low cost compared to the other modern machining processes.

With the absence of cutting tool in these processes, the material removal mechanism is governed by a large number of input variables. Precise control and setting of several input variables involved in these processes plays very important role to remove the material rapidly with better surface finish and low cost.
For example, ultrasonic machining needs precise setting of amplitude and frequency of vibration, abrasive jet machining needs close control on mass flow rate of abrasive particles along with abrasive geometry. Similarly, wire cut electric discharge machining involves some important input variables such as pulse-on/off time, wire tension, wire speed, pulse frequency, etc., which should be controlled effectively. Hence, in the present work, these three processes viz. ultrasonic machining (USM), abrasive jet machining (AJM), and wire cut electric discharge machining (WEDM) are considered for their parameters optimi-zation. An application example is considered for each process from the literature which involves specific objectives for each process along with their respective variable bounds and con-straints. These examples were previously attempted by various researchers using different optimization techniques and in the present work, the recently developed advanced optimization algorithm named  X  X eaching X  X earning-based optimization (TLBO) X  is applied to these examples to obtain the optimum parameter settings. A significant improvement in the results is obtained in the present work using TLBO algorithm as compared to the results obtained by the previous researchers using different optimization techniques.

The next section describes the selected modern machining processes with detailed literature review on the respective process parameters optimization. 2. Parameter optimization of selected modern machining processes
In many manufacturing industries, the parameter setting is made based on the skill of the operator or based on the handbook recommendations. However, due to this, optimum parameter setting is not achieved which leads towards reduced production, poor quality and increased cost of product. By implementing the present approach of process parameter optimization, the manu-facturing engineers will be able to increase the production rate with better quality and less rejections thereby decreasing the cost of the product.

In this section the importance of parameter optimization of selected modern machining processes i.e., USM, AJM and WEDM is discussed with more focus on various input and output variables involved in each process, detailed literature review with respective optimization aspects and the need for the application of advanced optimization techniques for the process parameter optimization of these processes. 2.1. Ultrasonic machining
Ultrasonic machining process (USM) is one of the widely used modern machining processes in various industries. In USM process the material is removed due to the action of abrasive grains. The abrasive particles are forced on the work surface by a tool oscillating normal to the work surface at a high frequency.
The tool is shaped as the approximate mirror image of the configuration of cavity desired on the workpiece. The various input parameters involved in USM process are amplitude of tool oscillation, type of abrasive, grain size of the abrasives, feed force, volume concentration of abrasive in water slurry, etc., which affect various performance measures of the process such as material removal rate and surface roughness.

Few attempts were made in the past on various optimization aspects of USM process. Wang and Rajurkar (1996) presented a dynamic analysis of the USM process based on impact mechanics. The factors affecting t he material removal rate were studied and it was found that the theoretical estimates obtained from the dynamic model were in good agreement with the experimental results. Lee and Chan (1997) studied the effect of amplitude, static load and the size of abrasives on the material removal rate and surface roughness and concluded that any increase in work/energy in terms of these parameters would result in increase in material removal rate and a rough-ening of machined surface.
 parameters of USM process. Singh and Khamba (2007) proposed an approach for macromodelling of the material removal rate, tool wear rate, and surface roughness during ultrasonic machining of titanium and its alloys and obtained the relationship between these output parameters of USM with other controllable machining parameters. Kumar and Khamba (2009) showed the effectiveness of the ultrasonic machining of Stellite 6 in terms of tool wear rate and the material removal rate of work piece and determined the optimum combination of various input factors by applying the
Taguchi X  X  multi-objective optimization technique. Rao et al. (2010a) attempted the parameter optimization of USM process using ABC,
HS and PSO algorithms and an example was presented. In another work, Rao et al. (2010b) presented the application of simulated annealing (SA) to the USM process. 2.2. Abrasive jet machining that removes material by directing a high-velocity stream of abrasive particles onto a workpiece. The particles coming out of the nozzle with very high velocities impinge the target surface and remove the material by erosion. Most existing models for AJM are based on erosion models for either ductile or brittle materials.
Typical applications of AJM are for deburring, shallow machining and for etching. Various input parameters involved in AJM process are abrasive grit size, spray angle, nozzle tip distance, nozzle size, jet velocity, mixture ratio, carrier fluid pressure, etc. optimization of the AJM process. Venkatesh et al. (1989) studied the results of machining under various conditions of abrasive jet machining. Various parameters like nozzle tip distance, spray angles, pressure, etc., were involved and empirical evaluation was carried out to characterize quantitatively the effects of various machining conditions. Verma and Lal (1984) studied the effects of various input parameters such as stand-off distance, mixture ratio, carrier fluid pressure, grain size, etc., on the material removal rate as well as penetration rate. Balasubramaniam et al. (2002) dis-cussed the effects of particle size, stand-off distance, center line and peripheral velocities of jet on the generated shape of machined surface and derived an equation to obtain the shape of surface generated by AJM process. Wakuda et al. (2003) attempted to identify the material response of alumina ceramics to the abrasive particle impact in the AJM process.
 time, stand-off distance between edge and nozzle, and orientation of a nozzle on the edge radius and edge profile. Jain et al. (2007) carried out the work on parameters optimization of AJM process using genetic algorithm. Tsai et al. (2008) applied the concept of
Taguchi X  X  design of experiments to identify the optimal para-meters setting for abrasive jet polishing of desired specimens and investigated the effects of the additive type, abrasive particle material and size in achieving the desired surface finish. Ke et al. (2011) employed abrasive jet machining with a composite abra-sive to reduce the surface roughness of recycled wafers. Taguchi X  X  method was used to explore the impact of different processing parameters on surface quality and to optimize the combination of processing parameters.
 2.3. Wire electrical discharge machining
The spark theory of a wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) process is basically the same as that of the vertical electrical discharge machining (EDM) process. In WEDM, the conductive materials are machined with a series of electrical discharges (sparks) that are produced between an accurately positioned moving wire and the workpiece. High frequency pulses of alternating or direct current is discharged from the wire to the workpiece with a very small spark gap through an insulated dielectric fluid (water). The wire does not touch the workpiece, so there is no physical pressure imparted on the workpiece com-pared to grinding wheels or any other cutting tools used in other conventional machining processes. The WEDM provides more flexibility in designing the dies and more control of manufactur-ing as the process is completely automatic. The WEDM process is controlled by large number of input parameters such as pulse-on time, pulse-off time, table feed rate, flushing pressure, wire tension, wire speed, pulse frequency, average gap voltage, dis-charge current, dielectric flow rate, etc.

Several attempts related to optimization aspects of WEDM process were observed in the past. Tarng et al. (1995) used feed forward neural network and SA algorithm to associate the cutting parameters with the cutting performance. Liao et al. (1997) used a feasible direction method and obtained the optimal machining parameters for WEDM process. Hewidy et al. (2005) developed the mathematical models using response surface methodology for correlating the inter-relationships of various WEDM machining parameters of Inconel 601 material on the metal removal rate, wear ratio and surface roughness. Kuriakose and Shunmugam (2005) used a multiple regression model to represent relationship between input and output variables and a multi-objective opti-mization method based on a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) was used to optimize the WEDM process.
Sarkar et al. (2008) developed a second-order mathematical model, in terms of machining parameters, for surface roughness, dimensional shift and cutting speed using response surface meth-odology and the results were optimized by using desirability function approach. Rao et al. (2009) used ABC algorithm for the parameters optimization of WEDM process and obtained the optimal combination of process parameters with an objective of achieving maximum machining speed for a desired value of surface finish. Mahapatra and Patnaik (2007) used genetic algorithm to achieve various objectives of WEDM process like metal removal rate, surface finish, and cutting width by optimizing the parameters of the process such as discharge current, pulse duration, pulse frequency, wire speed, wire tension, dielectric flow rate which are involved in the models. Satishkumar et al. (2011) discussed the effect of WEDM parameters such as pulse-on time, pulse-off time, gap voltage and wire feed on material removal rate and surface roughness in metal matrix composites consisting of aluminium alloy (Al 6063 ) and silicon carbide (SiCp). Regression equations were also developed based on the experimental data for the prediction of output parameters.

It is observed from the review of past work that comparatively less work was carried out for the parameter optimization of these modern machining processes. Few traditional optimization techni-ques such as goal programming, feasible direction method, etc., had been reported to solve the problems of optimization of some of these processes, but subsequently it was proved that the results obtained by these traditional techniques are not the optimum and also these techniques are very complex in nature and cannot handle multi-objective problems effectively. To overcome the drawbacks of traditional optimization techniques, few researchers attempted the advanced optimization techniques like GA and its versions, SA, PSO and ABC algorithms. These algorithms have been applied to many engineering optimization problems and proved their effectiveness in solving some specific kinds of problems. However, GA does not provide an optimal solution for a complex problem having large number of variables and constraints. This is mainly due to difficulty in determination of optimum algorithm-specific controlling para-meters such as crossover rate and mutation rate. In case of PSO, it requires fine tuning of inertia weight and other parameters. SA requires the fine setting of initial temperature, which affects its effectiveness to give optimum solution. Similar is the case with other optimization techniques like ABC, GEM, etc., which requires close control over the initial parameter setting of the algorithm. Hence, recently developed new optimization technique named as teaching X  X earning-based optimization (TLBO) proposed by Rao et al. (2011 , 2012) and Rao and Patel (2012) is used here which does not require any algorithm-specific parameter setting.
To check for any improvement in the results, this algorithm is considered here for the parameters optimization of USM, AJM and WEDM processes. Parameters optimization of individual pro-cesses is explained with the help of different examples and results are compared with the previous results. The TLBO algorithm is explained in detail in the next section. 3. Teaching X  X earning-based optimization algorithm
Teaching X  X earning-based optimization algorithm (TLBO) is a teaching X  X earning process inspired algorithm recently proposed by Rao et al. (2011 , 2012) and Rao and Patel (2012) based on the effect of influence of a teacher on the output of learners in a class. The algorithm mimics teaching X  X earning ability of teacher and learners in a class room. Teacher and learners are the two vital components of the algorithm and describes two basic modes of the learning, through teacher (known as teacher phase) and interacting with the other learners (known as learner phase). The output in TLBO algorithm is considered in terms of results or grades of the learners which depend on the quality of teacher. A high quality teacher is usually considered as a highly learned person who trains learners so that they can have better results in terms of their marks or grades. Moreover, learners also learn from the interaction among themselves which also helps in improving their results.
TLBO is population based method. In this algorithm a group of learners are considered as population and different subjects offered to the learners are considered as different design para-meters and a learner X  X  result is analogous to the  X  X itness X  value of the optimization problem. The best solution in the entire popula-tion is considered as the teacher. The design parameters are actually the parameters involved in the objective function of the given optimization problem and the best solution is the best value of the objective function. The working of TLBO is divided into two parts,  X  X eacher phase X  and  X  X earner phase X . Working of both the phase is explained below. 3.1. Teacher phase
It is the first part of the algorithm where learners learn through the teacher. During this phase a teacher tries to increase the mean result of the class in the subject taught by him or her depending on his or her capability. At any iteration i , assume that there are  X  m  X  number of subjects (i.e., design parameters),  X  n  X  number of learners learners in a particular subject  X  j  X ( j  X  1,2, y , m )Thebestoverall result X total-k best, i , obtained in the entire population of learners considering all the subjects together can be considered as the result of best learner k best . However, as the teacher is usually considered as a highly learned person who trains learners so that they can have better results, the best learner identified is considered as the teacher. The difference between the existing mean result of each subject and the corresponding result of the teacher for each subject is given by: subject j, T F is the teaching factor which decides the value of mean to be changed, and r i is the random number in the range [0, 1]. The value of T F is decided randomly with equal probability as: T  X  round  X  1  X  rand  X  0 , 1  X  2 1  X  2  X  T is not a parameter of the TLBO algorithm. The value of T F given as an input to the algorithm and its value is randomly decided by the algorithm using Eq. (2). After conducting a number of experiments on many benchmark functions it is concluded that the algorithm performs better if its value is between 1 and 2.
However, the algorithm is found to perform much better if the value of T F is either 1 or 2 and hence to simplify the algorithm, the teaching factor is suggested to take either 1 or 2 depending on the rounding up criteria given by Eq. (2). However, one can take any value of T F in between 1 and 2.

Based on the Difference_Mean j , k , i the existing solution is updated in the teacher phase according to the following expres-sion.
 better function value. All the accepted function values at the end of the teacher phase are maintained and these values become the input to the learner phase. 3.2. Learner phase
It is the second part of the algorithm where learners increase their knowledge by interaction among themselves. A learner interacts randomly with other learners for enhancing his or her knowledge. A learner learns new things if the other learner has more knowledge than him or her. Considering a population size of  X  n  X , the learning phenomenon of this phase is expressed below.
X total-P, i and X total-Q, i, , respectively at the end of teacher phase).
Accept X 00 j ,P, i , if it gives a better function value. All the accepted function values at the end of the learner phase are maintained and these values become the input to the teacher phase of the next iteration. The values of r i used in Eqs. (1), (4) and (5) can be different. Repeat the procedure of teacher phase and learner phase till the termination criterion is met. advanced optimization algorithm for the parameter optimization of USM, AJM and WEDM processes with suitable examples. 4. Application examples 4.1. Example 1: USM process sidered here which was earlier attempted by Jain et al. (2007) ,
Rao et al. (2010a , 2010b) and Shaw (1956) . The important decision variables involved in the mathematical model were amplitude of vibration  X  A v  X  (mm); frequency of vibration  X  f or cycles/s); mean diameter of abrasive grains  X  d m  X  (mm); volu-metric concentration of abrasive particles in slurry  X  C av feed force  X  F s  X  (N). The mathematical model for maximization of material removal rate as used by Jain et al. (2007) is given by
Eq. (6).Material removal rate (MRR)  X  which is given by Eq. (7). 1 : 0 2  X  1154 : 7 =  X  A t s fw  X  1  X  l  X  X  0 : 5  X  R a  X  max variables are given below: 0 : 005 r A v r 0 : 1  X  mm  X  10 , 000 r f v r 40 , 000  X  Hz  X  0 : 007 r d m r 0 : 15  X  mm  X  0 : 05 r C av r 0 : 5 4 : 5 r F s r 45  X  N  X  same as those considered by Jain et al. (2007) . Genetic algorithm was used by Jain et al. (2007) to get the optimized process parameters for achieving maximum MRR. A large population size of 126 was used by Jain et al. (2007) with 100 iterations and reported the maximum MRR of 3.553 mm 3 /s. The individual optimized parameters for this maximum MRR is given in
Table 1 . Similarly, Rao et al. (2010a) attempted the same model by using ABC, HS and PSO algorithms and in another attempt Rao et al. (2010b) used SA algorithm to the same model. The max-imum MRR reported by these algorithms are given in Table 1 along with its parameters setting. As these algorithms require a fine tuning of controlling parameters to get the optimum results, hence the results obtained by these algorithm may not be the global optimum solutions. Hence, attempt is carried out here to check for the possibility of further improvement in this optimum solution obtained by Jain et al. (2007) and Rao et al. (2010a , 2010b) . The proposed TLBO algorithm which is free from the algorithm-specific parameters is now applied to the same model.
However, to find out the optimum values of the common controlling parameters such as population size and the number of iterations, the algorithm is executed a number of times with different population sizes and number of iterations. At this point, it is important to clarify that in the TLBO algorithm, the solution is updated in the teacher phase as well as in the learner phase. Also, in the duplicate elimination step, if duplicate solutions are present then they are randomly modified. So the total number of function evaluations in the TLBO algorithm isequal to {(2 population size number of iterations)  X  (function evalua-tions required for duplicate elimination)} as given by Rao and
Patel (2012) . In the entire experimental work of this paper, the above formula is used to count the number of function evalua-tions while executing all examples with TLBO algorithm. Since the function evaluations required for duplication removal are not clearly known, experiments are conducted with different popula-tion sizes and based on those trials it is decided to consider 1000 function evaluations for the duplication removal in the case of all examples considered in this work while doing fair comparison.
The TLBO algorithm has converged very fast with a total execution time of about 0.35 s. A maximum material removal rate of 4.004 mm 3 /s is given by the TLBO algorithm which is better than that given by all the previously used algorithms. The execution of program is repeated 30 times to check for variation in the result. However, the same best result is obtained during maximum number of times. The comparison of results between the TLBO and other algorithms is given in Table 1 . The conver-gence of material removal rate obtained by the TLBO algorithm is shown in Fig.1 . Comparison between the results clearly shows that the proposed TLBO algorithm has outperformed the other algorithms in terms of better result with a small population size and less number of iterations.

However, to make fair comparison among the optimization algorithms, attempt is also made to execute the TLBO algorithm with same number of function evaluations as that used by Jain et al. (2007) for genetic algorithm. Rao et al. (2010a , 2010b) had not mentioned about the population size and number of itera-tions in their work, hence the fair comparison is made only with the genetic algorithm reported by Jain et al. (2007) . A population size of 126 with number of iterations as 100 were reported by Jain et al. (2007) which makes the total number of function evalua-tions as 12,600. For fair comparison purpose, the TLBO algorithm is executed with population size of 29 and number of iterations as 200 to order to meet exactly the same number of function evaluations, i.e., 12,600. The calculation of this function evalua-tion is done by using the same formula as explained above with 1000 function evaluations of duplicate removal. The reason for taking large number of iterations in this case, i.e., 200 is to check whether the TLBO algorithm is getting trapped with local opti-mum solution or not. The TLBO algorithm has again given the same maximum material removal rate of 4.004 mm 3 /s in this case also. Thus it can be concluded that the TLBO algorithm requires comparatively very less number of function evaluations to achieve the global optimum solution. The problem of local solution entrap-ment is also not observed in case of TLBO algorithm. The conver-gence of result obtained with 200 iterations is shown in Fig. 2 . 4.2. Example 2: AJM process
In this example, AJM process is considered for the parameter optimization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of TLBO algorithm, an optimization problem is considered here which consists of separate models for ductile and brittle materials. These models were earlier attempted by Jain et al. (2007) and Rao et al. (2010b) ; whereas Sarkar and Pandey (1976) attempted the model of only the ductile material and Hutching (1981) attempted the model of brittle material. Both these models are described below and considered for parameter optimization. 4.2.1. Parameter optimization of AJM process for brittle material
The mathematical model used by Jain et al. (2007) and subsequently followed by Rao et al. (2010b) consists of three decision variables viz. mass flow rate of abrasive particles  X  M (kg/s), mean radius of abrasive particles  X  r m  X  (mm), and velocity of abrasive particles  X  v a  X  (mm/s). The mathematical model to max-imize the material removal rate is given by Eq. (8) and the surface roughness constraint is given by Eq. (9).Material removal rate (MRR)  X  Surface roughness constraint  X  1 : 0 2  X  18 : 26 =  X  R a  X  max n  X  r a = s fw 0 : 5 r m n
All the constants used in the model are the same as those used by Jain et al. (2007) and same variable bounds are considered which are given below: 0 : 0000167 r M a r 0 : 0005  X  kg = s  X  0 : 005 r r m r 0 : 075  X  mm  X  150 , 000 r v a r 400 , 000  X  mm = s  X 
Jain et al. (2007) used GA with population size of 76 and number of iterations as 100 and obtained the maximum MRR of 8.236 mm 3 /s. The optimum parameters obtained by Jain et al. (2007) are given in Table 2 . Rao et al. (2010b) used SA algorithm 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4 4.1 MRR (mm3/s) for the parameter optimization of same model and obtained the maximum MRR of 8.257 mm 3 /s. However, attempt is carried out here by using TLBO algorithm to check for improvement in the result. A population size of 50 is used here for the algorithm along with 20 iterations. The parameters setting and results obtained by the TLBO algorithm are shown in Table 2 along with the comparison with previous results.

The TLBO algorithm has shown a significant improvement in the result and has given the maximum MRR of 8.9769 mm 3 /s.
This shows the superiority of TLBO algorithm over GA and SA. The convergence of result is shown in Fig.3 . The fair comparison is also made between genetic algorithm and TLBO algorithm in the similar way as explained above in example 1 by considering same number of function evaluations and obtained the same result of
MRR of 8.9769 mm 3 /s. 4.2.2. Parameter optimization of AJM process for ductile material
Another example of AJM is considered here in which ductile material was used. The mathematical model earlier developed by Hutching (1981) and subsequently used by Jain et al. (2007) and
Rao et al. (2010b) is considered here for the process parameters optimization of AJM process. The decision variables involved in the model were mass flow rate of abrasive particles  X  M a mean radius of abrasive particles  X  r m  X  (mm) and velocity of abrasive particles  X  v a  X  (mm/s). The mathematical model of the process and the surface roughness constraint involved are given by Eqs. (10) and (11), respectively.

Material removal rate (MRR)  X 
Surface roughness constraint  X  1 : 0 2  X  25 : 82 =  X  R a  X  max n  X  r a = H dw 0 : 5 r m n All the constants used in the model are taken from the work of
Jain et al. (2007) and same variable bounds are considered here which are given below: 0 : 0000167 r M a r 0 : 0005  X  kg = s  X  results are compared with the GA used by Jain et al. (2007) and
SA used by Rao et al. (2010b) . The population size used in this case is 50 with 20 iterations. The comparison of results is given in
Table 3 which shows that the TLBO algorithm has proved its superiority in this constrained optimization problem also. The
TLBO algorithm has given the maximum MRR of 0.7258 mm 3 /s as compared to 0.6025 mm 3 /s given by Jain et al. (2007) using GA and 0.6053 mm 3 /s given by Rao et al. (2010b) using SA. Fig. 4 shows the convergence of result obtained by TLBO algorithm.
TLBO algorithm has given the same result during fair comparison also between GA and TLBO by considering the same number of function evaluations. 4.3. Example 3: WEDM process model reported by Rao and Pawar (2009) is used for the parameter optimization of WEDM process. The models involves four important process parameters namely, pulse on time ( T
The objective of the work is to maximize the cutting speed ( V by ensuring the constraint value of surface roughness ( R should not exceed the permissible surface roughness ( R per models used by Rao and Pawar (2009) for cutting speed and surface roughness are given by Eqs. (12) and (13), respectively, whereas Eq. (14) gives the surface roughness constraint.

In the another work, Rao (2011) reported the applica-tion of various optimization techniques like PSO, SA, shuffled frog leaping (SFL) and modified harmony search algorithms (HS_M) to MRR (mm3/s) the same model of cutting speed and surface roughness using only 2.0 as the permissible surface roughness value. In the present work also, only one value of permissible surface roughness, i.e., 2.0 m m is considered for the demonstration purpose. The proposed
TLBO algorithm is applied to the same model of cutting speed by using 20 iterations along with the population size of 10. Whereas, in the case of ABC algorithm, population size and number of iterations reported by Rao and Pawar (2009) were 150 each. The optimum process parameters setting obtained by the TLBO algorithm is given in Table 4 along with the comparison of result with the results of
Rao and Pawar (2009) and Rao (2011) and the convergence of result is shown in Fig. 5 .

The maximum cutting speed given by the TLBO algorithm is 1.4287 mm/min, which is better than all the other optimization algorithms used for the same model. The number of iterations used in the case of ABC algorithm was 150, whereas TLBO algorithm has given the result using only 20 iterations. Thus, in case of WEDM also, the TLBO algorithm has proved its superiority and has given improvement in the result with less iteration compared to other advanced optimization algorithms like ABC. However, in this case also the fair comparison is carried out between ABC and TLBO algorithms by taking the total function evaluations of 22,500 in both the cases. The TLBO algorithm has performed better during fair comparison also and any local solution entrapment is not observed. 5. Conclusion In this work three different modern machining processes USM, AJM and WEDM are considered for respective parameters opti-mization using a new optimization algorithm named  X  X  X eaching X  learning-based optimization X  X  algorithm. Different examples are considered for each process and some examples are having constraints and multi-objective models. The same models were earlier attempted by other researchers using GA, SA, ABC, HS, SFL and PSO algorithm. The newly developed TLBO algorithm is successfully applied to all these examples and it has given considerable improvement in terms of results and convergence.
In case of USM process, the TLBO algorithm has given the improvement of approximately 12% over genetic algorithm and a considerable improvement over other algorithms used for the same model. Similarly, the improvement obtained in case of AJM process is 8% and 20% for brittle material and ductile material respectively over genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm. In case of WEDM process, the TLBO algorithm has given considerable improvement over that of ABC results. Thus the TLBO algorithm is proved superior over the other advanced optimization algorithms in terms of results and convergence.
The TLBO algorithm is applied in this paper only to the modern machining processes like USM, AJM and WEDM. However, it can also be applied to other modern machining processes and various manufacturing processes like welding, casting, forming, etc. Application of TLBO algorithm to the multi-objective manufactur-ing optimization problems can also be attempted. The future research work includes these aspects. Furthermore, attempts will be made to improve the TLBO algorithm. At present the algorithm uses the greedy selection procedure at the end of both the teacher 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 MRR (mm3/s) Vm (mm/min) and the learner phases which may sometimes lead to an increase in the computational effort. The algorithm may be made more efficient by modifying the greedy selection at the end of both the phases. Consideration of different teachers for different subjects, learning through tutorials, and self-learning of learners are the other aspects of future research work.
