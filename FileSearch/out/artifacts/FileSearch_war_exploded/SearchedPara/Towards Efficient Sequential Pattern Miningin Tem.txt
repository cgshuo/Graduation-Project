 very common that timestamps of events might be inaccurate or imprecise in reasons: monitoring sensor networks, temperatures are measured periodically. The exact time of a sudden temperature change is unknown, and it can only be inferred from raw data probabilistically. scales. For example, a handhold GPS device may update the position every 10 minutes; while a GPS on a fast-moving vehicle may report every 5 sec-onds. And the temporal relationship is uncertain between two events within different granularities. poral scales. For example, an economic indicator may be aggregated from time period. time domain. However, this model becomes inaccurate and inconvenient when any discrete time domain.
 databases. Our main contributions are listed as follows: sible world semantics to interpret this type of temporal uncertainty. of mining uncertain sequential patterns by a pattern-growth algorithm. bility of our algorithm. all designed for sequence databases with accurate timestamps. their techniques cannot be directly employed. 3.1 Temporal Uncertain Sequence Database uncertain event is represented by e = sid, eid, T, I . Here id, are not guaranteed to be ordered by their eid s. An uncertain timestamp modeled by a uniform distribution T  X  U ( t  X  ,t + ), where [ T .
 I is an itemset that describes the content of event e .
 of events that are associated with the same sid and an event identified by and eid = j is denoted by e ij . For example, e indicates that event { A, C } occurs at time T , where T  X  U distributed within 100 and 103. 3.2 Temporal Possible Worlds uncertain timestamps.
 It is widely assumed that uncertain sequences in D are mutually indepen-the possible words can be computed by Equation ( 1 ). T ij  X  U ( t  X  ij ,t + ij ) be the uncertain time of event e shown in Equation ( 2 ). 3.3 Uncertain Sequential Pattern Mining Problem A sequential pattern  X  = X 1  X  X  X  X n is supported by a sequence denoted by  X   X  , if and only if there exists integers { k have X i .I  X  Y k i .I (  X  i  X  [1 ,n ]) and l  X  Y k i +1 .t  X  Y l = mingap is the minimal time gap constraint between two adjacent events of  X  and h = maxgap is the maximal time gap constraint.
 s D Where w is a possible world in which s is frequent and f ( Given a minimal support t s , a minimal frequentness probability threshold sequential pattern s in a temporal uncertain database, which has t )  X  t p . 4.1 Frequentness Probability Suppose D = { d 1 ,...,d n } is a temporal uncertain database and probability is P ( sup ( s | d i )=1)= P ( s d i ). sup ( s ) is a Poisson-Binomial random variable, since it is the sum of function (pmf) of sup ( s )is P ( sup ( s )= i )= p i , where Transform (FFT) technology in [ 14 ] to compute the pmf of Where, t s is the minimal support threshold and p i = P ( is the probability that the support of s in D equals to i if
P ( sup ( s )  X  t s )  X  t p . 4.2 Support Probability We first define the minimal possible occurrence of a sequential pattern uncertain sequence d .
 Definition 1. Given a sequential pattern s and an uncertain sequence set d of d (e.g. d  X  d ) is called a minimal possible occurrence of if (1) P ( s d ) &gt; 0 ;(2)  X  d  X  d ,P ( s d )=0 .
 For example, in Fig. 1 , { e 21 ,e 22 } and { e 21 ,e 23 } occurrences of the sequential pattern A , B in the sequence is not a minimal occurrence of A , B . Then the support probability can be computed by Equation ( 6 ), since event timestamps are independent. Here o s i ( i =1 ,...,N )are N minimal possible occurrences of computation of P ( s o s i ) is discussed in section 4.3 . 4.3 Probability of Satisfying Time Constraints Let o s = s o ), denoted by P ( T 1  X  X  X  T n ), is the probability that T between two adjacent timestamps and h is the maximal time gap. is shown in Equation ( 7 ).
 a new approach to compute P ( T 1  X  X  X  T n ) efficiently. Basic Case. We first consider the basic case of two uncertain timestamps U ( x  X  ,x + )and Y  X  U ( y  X  ,y + ). Given time constraints mingap h , P ( XY ) can be computed in Equation ( 8 ).
 Equation ( 8 ) is decomposed into p deterministic cases, if [ into p disjoint subintervals by the endpoints { x + + l, x  X  [ y  X  ,y + ]= [ y  X  i ,y + i ] ,  X  i  X  [1 ,p ]. Here Y k  X  U random variable, and P ( XY ) can be computed by Equation ( 9 ). compute P ( XY k )in O (1) time, which is shown in Equation ( 10 ). distribution of X and Y k ,and S k is the area within A k constraints. Here H = y + k  X  y  X  k , L 1 and L 2 are computed as follows. where X  X  U[60 , 63] and Y  X  U[62 , 68]. There two endpoints [62 , 63]  X  [63 , 65]  X  [65 , 68]. Let Y 1  X  U[62 , 63], Y 2  X  U[63 , 65] and Y 3  X  U[65 , 68], then we have
P ( Y = Y
P ( Y = Y
P ( Y = Y Thereafter, P ( XY )= 3 i =1 P ( XY i  X  Y i )=0 . 72.
 General Case. Given uniformly distributed uncertain timestamps suppose the range of T n is divided into p sub-partitions as [ and
T pute
P ( T Where P ( T 1  X  X  X  T n i ) can be computed by Equation ( 13 ).
P ( T 1 ,...,T n i )= P values when we search pattern s , in order to avoid repeated computation. compute potential end points by the ranges of Y 1 , Y 2 and z z z [65 , 70] = [65 , 67]  X  [67 , 68]  X  [68 , 70]. Let Z 1  X  U[65 Z an example.
 tion ( 10 ), we can compute P ( Y 1 Z 1 )=1, P ( Y 2 Z 1 )=1, Thereafter, we have P ( XY Z 1 )=1  X  1 6  X  2 . 5 3 +1  X  2 Therefore, we arrive to the final result P ( XY Z )=0 . 4 0 . 4  X  0 . 3333 = 0 . 4777. 4.4 Uncertain SPM Algorithm We integrate our uncertain management approach into the classic SPM algo-fixSpan in our uncertain SPM algorithm. (1) We project the database by minimal possible occurrences. Suppose { e k 1 ,...,e k n } is a minimal possible occurrence of s in sequence tion of d w.r.t. o s , denoted by d | o s , eliminates any event e is a collection of projected sequences, where d i | o 1 ,...,o set of p projected sequences of d i w.r.t. to the minimal occurrences s in d i . For example, in Fig. 1 ,ifweset mingap =1andlet s D | rence. Let o s = { e k 1 ,...,e k n } be a minimal possible occurrence of T i = e k i .T  X  i  X  [1 ,n ]. Suppose the range [ t  X  n ,t + tervals [ t  X  n ,t + n ]= [ t  X  n i ,t + n i ](  X  i  X  [1 ,k by Equation ( 12 ) and save the results in the form as p ,..., [ t  X  n sequences.
 rithm 1 . We first mine frequent items in D | s , denoted by uncertainty. A candidate pattern s = s + { i } is generated for each We compute the support probability of s in each uncertain sequence by Poisson Binomial distribution of the overall support sup ( probability is computed in Equation ( 5 ), by which we can determine if frequent patterns are mined. 5.1 Synthetic Data Generation number of different items.
 original synthetic datasets by a uniform distribution in [(1 where r is randomly drawn from the uniform distribution U T 4 L 10 I 1 C 10 indicates that T =4, L = 10, I =1  X  1000 and chain rule. This naive method is implemented and abbreviate as pare uSPM with NV to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. All the experiments were done in the desktop with Intel(R) Core (TM) Duo CPU @ 2.33GHz and 4GB memory. 5.2 Scalability and Efficiency with different scales, where we set minsup =0 . 5%, minprob and maxgap = 10. We initially have C = 10 000, T =4, I = 10 000 and In Figigure 4(a) , C varies from 1 000 to 100 000; In Fig. 4(b) , to 30; In Fig. 4(c) , L varies from 2 to 10; and In Fig. 4(c) 10 000.
 ness of our temporal uncertainty management approach. (2) The running time increment of I , because there are less repeated items in sequences when to a larger value.
 Fig. 5 compares the running time of uSPM and NV with different of user-defined parameters in the dataset T4L2I10C10. We initially set minprob =0 . 7, mingap =1,and maxgap = 10. In Fig. 5(a) , from 0 . 8% to 0 . 1%; in Fig. 5(b) , minprob varies from 0 varies from 5 to 80 in Fig. 5 .
 a larger maxgap indicates a less strict constraint of sequential patterns. We also apply uSPM to a real world stock market dataset. The prices for 882 stocks are extracted from Shanghai Stock Exchange Center in 16 weeks ([1,3], +).
 Here we set minprob =0 . 7, mingap =1and maxgap = 5. Fig. 6(a) shows of stock dataset increases significantly when we decrease the value of which is consistent with intuitive observations.
 rithm is efficient and scalable.
