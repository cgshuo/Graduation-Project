 ORIGINAL PAPER A. L. Kesidis  X  E. Galiotou  X  B. Gatos  X  I. Pratikakis Abstract In this paper, we propose a word spotting frame-work for accessing the content of historical machine-printed documents without the use of an optical character recogni-tion engine. A preprocessing step is performed in order to improve the quality of the document images, while word segmentation is accomplished with the use of two comple-mentary segmentation methodologies. In the proposed meth-odology, synthetic word images are created from keywords, and these images are compared to all the words in the dig-itized documents. A user feedback process is used in order to refine the search procedure. The methodology has been evaluated in early Modern Greek documents printed during the seventeenth and eighteenth century. In order to improve the efficiency of accessing and search, natural language pro-cessing techniques have been addressed that comprise a morphological generator that enables searching in documents using only a base word-form for locating all the correspond-ing inflected word-forms and a synonym dictionary that fur-ther facilitates access to the semantic context of documents.

In this paper, we deal with Greek his-torical religious documents printed during the seventeenth and eighteenth century. Traditional approaches in document indexing usually involve an optical character recognition (OCR) step [ 5 ]. Usually, printed OCR systems involve a character segmentation step followed by a recognition step using pattern classification algorithms. In the case of printed historical documents OCR, several factors affect the final performance like low paper quality, paper positioning vari-ations (skew, translations, etc), low print contrast, and type-setting imperfections. In literature, two general approaches can be identified: the segmentation approach and the holistic or segmentation-free approach. The segmentation approach requires that each word has to be segmented into charac-ters, while the holistic approach entails the recognition of the whole word. In the segmentation approach, the crucial step is to split a scanned bitmap image of a document into individual characters [ 13 ]. A holistic approach is followed in [ 15 , 18 , 21 , 24 , 27 ], where line and word segmentation is used for creating an index based on word matching.

Accessing the content of the documents necessarily implies the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. In particular, inflected word-forms that are used in the word spotting procedure are usually produced by a morphological generation tool. For the implementation of the morphological generator finite state techniques proved to be quite successful in many NLP applications covering a wide spectrum of languages [ 1 , 4 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 29 , 31 , 35 ]. Fur-thermore, access to the semantic content of the documents is facilitated by the implementation of a synonym dictionary [ 38 ].

In this paper, we propose an alternative method for access-ing the content of Greek historical documents printed during the seventeenth and eighteenth century by searching words directly in digitized documents based on word spotting aided by NLP techniques, without the use of an optical character recognition engine.

The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes the general framework of the proposed system. Section 3 con-cerns the word spotting process and describes its several phases. Section 4 describes the linguistic and computational approaches for the morphological generation system, while Sect. 5 details the synonym dictionary. Experimental results that demonstrate the proposed method are given in Sect. 6 . Finally, conclusions are drawn in Sect. 7 . 2 The proposed framework Our work concerns a collection of digitized Greek docu-ments printed during the seventeenth and eighteenth cen-turies. These texts contain a specific morphology, which reflects the evolution of the Greek language through the particular time period containing word-forms from Ancient, Medieval and Modern Greek. The proposed framework can be part of an information system for the processing, manage-ment and accessing to the content of the aforementioned col-lection of historical books and manuscripts. Figure 1 depicts the overall architecture of the proposed system. The word spotting component of the system introduces a novel way to initialize the word retrieval mechanism through the creation of synthetic word data along with a robust hybrid feature extraction that supports meaningful representations of word images. It consists of the following two phases: i. A preprocessing step that aims to improve the quality ii. A two-step word retrieval phase that aims to rank the The aim of the natural language system component is the use of advanced natural language processing techniques for the intelligent and effective searching in the collection such as the word spotting procedure. Query extension necessarily implies: i a morphological generation system that provides users ii a synonym dictionary that facilitates the access to the The novelty of the proposed approach consists of:  X  a word image retrieval system (word spotting) that links  X  the use of a combined word segmentation methodology  X  a generator of inflected word-forms that incorporates  X  extensive evaluation of the proposed word spotting for 3 Word spotting In the case of historical documents, Manmatha and Croft [ 26 ] presented a holistic method for word spotting wherein matching was based on the comparison of entire words rather than individual characters. Their method involved an off-line grouping of words appearing in a historical document and the manual characterization of each group by the ASCII equivalence of the corresponding words. This process can become very tedious when processing large collections of documents. In order to eliminate this process, we use a method for keyword search in historical printed documents which is based on [ 21 ] and consists of the following steps: (i) image preprocessing; (ii) creation of synthetic image words from keywords typed by the user; (iii) word segmentation using dynamic parameters; (iv) efficient feature extraction for each image word and (v) a retrieval procedure that is supported by user X  X  feedback. The word spotting procedure is initialized by applying the synthetic keyword image as the query image for the retrieval of all relevant words. The synthetic word is matched against all detected words, and the accuracy of the results is further optimized by the user X  X  feedback. Combination of synthetic data creation and user X  X  feedback leads to improved results in terms of precision and recall. The proposed workflow for keyword searching in his-torical printed documents is presented in the sequel. 3.1 Image preprocessing To aid toward a correct segmentation of historical documents into words, we follow three distinct steps, namely image binarization and enhancement, orientation and skew correc-tion and noisy border and frame removal. A detailed descrip-tion of each step is given in the sequel. 3.1.1 Image binarization and enhancement Binarization refers to the conversion of the gray-scale image to a binary image and is the starting step of most document image analysis systems. Moreover, since historical document collections are usually characterized by very low quality, an image enhancement stage is also essential. The proposed scheme for image binarization and enhancement is based on the work of [ 14 ] and consists of five distinct steps: a pre-processing procedure using a low-pass Wiener filter, a rough estimation of foreground regions, a background surface cal-culation by interpolating neighboring background intensities, a thresholding by combining the calculated background sur-face with the original image and finally a post-processing step that improves the quality of text regions and preserves stroke connectivity. The last step also eliminates noise and improves the quality of text regions by removing isolated pixels and filling possible breaks, gaps or holes. 3.1.2 Orientation and skew correction It is necessary to identify and correct the text orientation (portrait or landscape) and skew before proceeding to the word segmentation phase. Text orientation is determined by applying a horizontal/vertical smoothing, followed by a cal-culation procedure of vertical/horizontal black and white transitions [ 43 ]. For skew detection, a fast Hough transform approach is used that is based on the description of binary images using rectangular blocks [ 28 ]. 3.1.3 Noisy border and frame removal Often, images resulting from document scanning are framed by a solid or stripped black border. The methodology used for border removal is based on projection profiles com-bined with a connected component labeling process, while signal cross-correlation is also used in order to verify the detected noisy text areas [ 36 ]. Additionally, image projec-tions are used at the deskewed image in order to remove noisy text from neighboring pages. Finally, in order to ease the segmentation process, any potential frames around the text areas are also removed. Lines are detected by processing horizontal and vertical black runs as well as by morpholog-ical operations with suitable structuring elements that con-nect possible line breaks and enhance the line segments [ 12 ]. An example of applying image preprocessing step is given in Fig. 2 . 3.2 Segmentation In the proposed methodology, word segmentation is accomplished with the use of two complementary segmen-tation methodologies. The first is the run length smooth-ing algorithm (RLSA) [ 41 ] which is applied by using dynamic parameters that depend on the average charac-ter height as described in [ 21 ]. RLSA examines the white runs existing in the horizontal and vertical directions. For each direction, white runs with length less than a thresh-old are eliminated. In the proposed method, the hori-zontal length threshold is experimentally defined as 50% of the average character height, while the vertical length threshold is experimentally defined as 10% of the aver-age character height. The application of RLSA results in a binary image where characters of the same word become connected to a single connected component (Fig. 3 a). In the sequel, a connected component analysis is applied in order to extract the final word segmentation result (Fig. 3 b).

The second segmentation methodology that we use is based on projection profiles. A similar approach has been used for the word segmentation of historical and degraded machine-printed documents in [ 2 ]. At a first step, we calculate the horizontal projection profile by summing the foreground pixels in every scan line. After a smoothing procedure, we calculate the local minima that define the boundaries of the regions which contain the text lines (Fig. 4 a). For every detected text line, similar procedure based on vertical projections is used in order to detect words and characters (Fig. 4 b).

The combination of the two segmentation techniques is done as follows: Word matching is performed using word segmentation results from both methodologies. At the result list, if we have two results that correspond to different seg-mentation methodologies and their bounding boxes overlap, then we keep only the result that has the smaller distance to the query word (see Sect. 3.5 ). 3.3 Synthetic data creation The creation of synthetic image words from keywords typed by the user refers to the artificial creation of the keyword images from their ASCII equivalent. Thus, an image tem-plate for all required characters has to be previously defined and stored to the system. As shown in Fig. 5 , during the man-ual character template marking, an adjustment of the base-line for each character image template is supported in order to correctly align the character templates when constructing the synthetic word image. We follow this procedure in order to avoid inaccurate alignment results since there are charac-ters whose lower end is below the text line, e.g. the letter  X  in Fig. 5 . The character template selection is a process that is performed  X  X nce-for-all X  and can be used for entire books or collections that share a common typewriting style. 3.4 Feature extraction The segmented words of the historical document as well as the synthetic query word are described by features that are used during the word retrieval phase in order to measure sim-ilarity between word images. The feature extraction phase consists of two distinct steps: (i) normalization and (ii) hybrid feature extraction. 3.4.1 Normalization The normalization process is dedicated to preserve scale invariance for word images. In particular, for the normaliza-tion of the segmented words we use a bounding box with user-defined dimensions. The segmented words are resized to fit in the bounding box while preserving their aspect ratio. The size of the bounding box concerning both width and height is the same for all words. Thereafter, exact positioning of the word in the bounding box is achieved by placing the geomet-ric center of the word in the center of the bounding box. 3.4.2 Hybrid feature extraction Several features and methods have been proposed for word image matching based on strokes, contour analysis, etc [ 7 , 30 ]. In the proposed approach, two different types of fea-tures are used. The first one, which is based on [ 5 ], divides the word image into a set of zones and calculates the den-sity of the character pixels in each zone. The second type of features is based on word (upper/lower) profile projections. The word image is divided into two sections with respect to the horizontal line that passes through the center of mass of the word image. Upper/lower word profiles are computed by recording, for each image column, the distance from the upper/lower boundary of the word image to the closest char-acter pixel [ 30 ]. The word is divided into vertical zones. For each upper/lower word profile, we calculate the area in the upper and lower sections that correspond to the desired fea-tures. We build a set of 90 features based on zones and a set of 60 features based on profile projections, leading to an overall of 150 features for the hybrid scheme. 3.5 Word matching The process of word matching involves the comparison/ matching between the synthetic query word image and all the indexed segmented words. Ranking of the comparison results is based on calculating the Euclidean distance metric using the above-mentioned features [ 37 ]. An initial list of results is produced that sorts the segmented word images of the document according to their similarity to the synthetic word image created by the user. These results are refined in the user X  X  feedback phase. 3.6 User feedback From the initial ranking, we obtained the words of the docu-ment that are similar to the synthetic keyword. These results might not present high accuracy because a synthetic key-word cannot a priori perform a perfect match with a real word image. User feedback is an efficient mechanism for drastically improving the matching process. We propose a user intervention where the user selects as input query one or more correct results from the list produced after the ini-tial word matching process. Then, a new matching process is initiated. The segmented words are ranked according to their similarity to the selected word(s) which, in this case, are not synthetic but real words of the document X  X  corpus. The critical impact of the user feedback in the word spotting process lies upon this transition from synthetic to real data. Furthermore, in the proposed system the user interaction is supported by a simplified and user-friendly graphical inter-face that makes the word selection procedure an easy task. Figure 6 illustrates the flow diagram of the user feedback process. 4 A morphological generator for early Modern Greek Effective search in documents necessarily takes into account all possible inflected forms of a word without explicit for-mulation from the user. When search terms derive from a language with a rich morphological system like Greek, a morphological generation system based on a solid linguistic analysis is necessary.

The problem becomes even more complicated when deal-ing with historical documents where significant differences between the language of the text and the contemporary form of the language are observed. To this end, an attempt to deal with German historic texts with non-standard spelling is described in [ 8 ] where an algorithm for generating search term variants in ancient orthography of German is proposed.
In this paper, we describe an attempt to implement a gener-ator of inflected word-forms, which incorporates finite state rules aiming at covering the principals of the nominal inflec-tion phenomenon of an early stage of Modern Greek which X  to our knowledge X  X as not yet been systematically analyzed. In this way, extensibility of the system is assured, and it can be easily enriched with new words simply by establishing the correspondence to the representative of each inflectional class. A preliminary implementation of a subset of these finite state rules is described in [ 22 ]. 4.1 The linguistic approach Our experimentation is performed on a corpus that con-sists of digitized historical and religious documents printed during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The lan-guage of the particular time period reflects an early stage of Modern Greek and represents the evolution of the Greek language since it incorporates elements from Ancient, Medi-eval and Modern Greek. Although word structure in Modern Greek and earlier stages of the language remains the same, we came across certain significant differences especially in the number of inflected word-forms mainly due to two reasons:  X  The language in the particular time period contains a  X  Certain grammatical cases appearing the text, such as the The set of keywords used in the experiment entails historical, theological, philological and linguistic interest. These words are mainly nouns of relevant high frequency of appearance which characterize the documents. Moreover, some gram-matical elements of particular linguistic interest were taken into account. These keywords were further analyzed into their morpheme constituents and morphologically character-ized. In particular, the task of the morphological processing of the selected word-forms was divided into the following subtasks: i. Grammatical categorization of word-forms and classi-ii. Recognition of the internal morpheme components of iii. Grammatical characterization of morphemes and iv. Analysis of the words into stems and affixes v. Writing of rules to be used for the computational mor-
The results of the above-mentioned subtasks constitute the linguistic basis of our morphological processing tool which will be described in the following subsection. 4.2 The computational approach 4.2.1 The finite state approach to computational In recent years, finite state techniques have been widely used in many NLP applications such as tagging, parsing and information extraction [ 17 ]. Finite state approaches to morphology proved to be particularly successful covering a large spectrum of languages, including English, French, German, Dutch, Italian, Greek, Spanish, Portuguese, Finn-ish, Turkish, Arabic and other languages [ 1 , 16 , 17 , 20 , 31 ]. Morphological phenomena in Modern Greek have been extensively dealt with within the finite state framework, covering inflection, derivation and compounding [ 29 , 35 ]. Therefore, finite state technology was a promising choice for the implementation of our computational morphol-ogy that reflects a transitional period in the evolution of the Greek language and has not yet been systematically analyzed. 4.2.2 SFST-based morphological processing We have developed a software tool for the creation, manipu-lation and application of computational morphologies which embeds the SFST tools [ 33 , 34 ] X  X  collection of software tools for the generation, manipulation and processing of finite-state transducers that are specified by means of the SFST programming language. A SFST program is essen-tially a regular expression. The SFST system was developed by the Institute for Natural Language Processing, Univer-sity of Stuttgart. It comprises a compiler, which translates finite state transducer programs (regular expressions) into minimized transducers and a wide range of transducer oper-ations similar to commercial platforms such as XFST [ 4 ]. We opted for the SFST system because it is open source software and it supports UTF-8 character coding which is important for the implementation of Greek computational morpholo-gies. The source code of the SFST-PL (SFST Programming Language) can be downloaded from [ 45 ]. It has been com-piled using the MinGW and MSYS open software that can be downloaded from [ 46 ] and served as the basis of the SFST compiler. 4.3 The morphological generator 4.3.1 The system architecture The architecture of the morphological generation tool is illus-trated in Fig. 7 . The system provides the user with the pos-sibility to insert a new keyword and select a pattern as a representative of the appropriate inflectional class. Then, the finite state transducer file Morph.fst is created and dynami-cally compiled into the morph.a automaton that is responsible for the generation of word-forms. 4.3.2 The morphological generation process We have applied a lexeme-based approach to morphological processing where a word-form is considered as the result of applying rules that alter a word-form or stem in order to pro-duce a new one. An inflectional rule takes a stem, changes it as is required by the rule and outputs a word-form. During the generation process, users are able to: i. insert a new keyword ii. assign the appropriate inflectional class through the iii. perform a generation of all inflected word-forms At this stage of the processing, the user need not to be familiar with the finite state formalism. Moreover, no special linguis-tic knowledge is required by the user in order to choose the appropriate representative according to which the generation process will take place. Knowledge of the language at the native speaker level will suffice.

As a result to this procedure, the system enriches dynam-ically the list of keywords and inflected word-forms that are used in the word spotting procedure. 5 The synonym dictionary In order to facilitate the access to the semantic context of documents and to enrich the results during the search pro-cess, the use of semantic networks such as WordNet is sug-gested in [ 40 ]. Yet, the usage of the particular semantic network has been often questioned as for the performance improvement in the query expansion procedure. Therefore, the selection of the terms in the query expansion is per-formed either from manually created thesauri such as Word-Net [ 23 , 40 , 44 ] or from co-occurrence-based ones [ 3 , 10 , 11 ]. A hybrid approach taking into account both hand-crafted and co-occurrence-based thesauri is undertaken in [ 6 ] and [ 25 ]. As it has been recently proved in [ 9 ], exclusive use of man-ually created thesauri can lead to significant performance improvement.

In order to improve the efficiency of our system, we had to take into account the fact that the terms in the historical documents in the collection are drawn from the specific religious vocabulary. So, we have embedded a synonymy based on a relevance feedback technique since its function-ality is equivalent to that of a semantic network, and at the same time it avoids an unnecessary amount of ambiguity that could affect the accuracy and efficiency of the system [ 38 ].
Our approach is based on the methodology proposed in [ 38 ] in particular in ranking the synonymy relations in terms of their weight in the religious X  X istorical domain in order to associate them with a score that estimates how often the relation is used in the specific domain. Relations that are irrelevant to the domain are not inserted in the synonymy database.

Our synonym dictionary provides the user with two options: i. Add a word in the dictionary accompanied by up to five ii. Look up a word and its synonyms. With the use of a Emphasis was placed on the extensibility of the system as for the enrichment with new keywords and the generation of their corresponding word-forms. The system can be enriched with new words simply by defining the correspondence to the words that are representative of the inflectional classes. In addition, the generator was designed so as to be able to incorporate more morphological elements and deal with the phenomena of derivation and compounding. The choice of the meta-language for the construction of the automata facil-itates the experimentation with other linguistic phenomena without any substantial change to the system and provides a systematic and standard way for the implementation of reg-ular relations. 6 Experimental results The experiments addressed in this work are based on a corpus of 110 images which correspond to single pages of historical Greek documents printed during the seventeenth and eigh-teenth century. The query set consists of 32 keywords. For each keyword, the corresponding inflected word-forms have been determined using the proposed morphological gener-ator. The keywords and the corresponding inflected word-forms that appear in the document corpus are shown in Table 1 .

The overall ground truth has been determined in advance identifying all the instances of the keywords and the cor-responding word-forms. Throughout the whole corpus (110 document pages), there exist 757 word instances of inter-est. The image preprocessing steps described in Sect. 3.1 are applied to each document image separately. The document images are segmented at word level using two techniques presented in Sect. 3.2 , namely RLSA and projections pro-files. The overall number of segmented words in each case is 48,912 and 57,881 words, respectively. 6.1 Word segmentation evaluation This experiment concerns the evaluation of the word segmen-tation step which is critical for the complete word spotting procedure. The evaluation takes into account the segmenta-tion techniques used, namely the RLSA and the projection profiles. First, the performance of each segmentation meth-odology is evaluated separately and then the evaluation takes into account the combination of both segmentation tech-niques. The word segmentation accuracy is calculated for all word instances that correspond to keywords and the cor-responding inflected word-forms as defined in the ground truth. A word instance is considered as detected only if there is a significant overlap with an existing segmentation result. The overlap is expressed by the intersection over union met-ric IOU = A  X  B A  X  B where A and B denote the bounding box areas of the word instance and a segmented word, respec-tively [ 39 , 42 ]. The IOU metric ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 corresponds to exact matching. A threshold T is applied in order to decide whether the word instance and the segmented word match sufficiently. In the case where the segmentation methods are used in a combined way and a word instance matches sufficiently a segmented keyword from either segmentation method, then the one with the highest IOU value is considered. Figure 11 shows the word segmentation results when applied to the whole document corpus using the segmentation methods separately as well as combined. Five different values of threshold values T have been applied rang-ing from 0.5 up to 0.9 by a step of 0.1. It is clearly shown in Fig. 11 that in all cases, the combination of the afore-mentioned segmentation techniques results in significantly improved word segmentation accuracy. 6.2 Word spotting In the following experiment, the word spotting procedure is evaluated by searching instances of each keyword in the set of segmented words. For each keyword, a synthetic word image representation is created using character templates that correspond to the ASCII equivalent of each character. The synthetic word image features are matched against the fea-tures of each segmented word image in the document corpus, and finally a ranking is given based upon their similarity. This process is applied separately for each one of the two segmen-tation methods. In order to retrieve the best results, the two ranking lists are combined and a re-ranking is applied. In the course of this procedure, special consideration should be given, so that any multiple instances of the same segmented word are removed from the combined ranking list. The rule applied defines that only the word with the highest similarity to the synthetic keyword is retained.

The initial ranked list is used in order to select the cor-rect words of the corpus according to the user X  X  feedback performing a transition from synthetic to real data. In this case, the segmented words are ranked according to their simi-larity to the selected real word(s) of the document X  X  corpus. In our experiments, the user X  X  feedback was emulated by select-ing the top one, two and three relevant instances from the initial ranked list. For each selected real word, a new match-ing process is initiated. The matching results for the one, two or three selected words are merged and re-ranked in order to get the final ranked list. In all cases, where user feedback is involved, the  X  X reezing X  method [ 19 , 32 ] is applied during the evaluation process. In the traditional freezing approach, any list entries identified as relevant by the user are kept  X  X ro-zen X  in their original ranks. The purpose of this process is that because of freezing, the relevant instances selected by the user are not re-retrieved with better ranks.

Figure 12 shows retrieval results for the query keyword  X  X   X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X   X . The synthetic keyword composed by charac-ter templates is shown in Fig. 12 a. Figure 12 bshowsthe first 15 entries in the ranking list without user feedback. It contains the segmented words ranked according to their similarity to the synthetic keyword. A check mark denotes segmented words that are relevant instances of the keyword according to the ground truth. The first three relevant words are marked by a red bounding box. The user X  X  feedback effect is demonstrated in Fig. 12 c X  X . In particular, Fig. 12 cshows the retrieval results when the user selects the first relevant instance as appear in Fig. 12 b and an updated matching process is applied. Similarly, Fig. 12 d X  X  show the retrieval results when the user selects the first two and three relevant instances, respectively.

Figure 13 shows the retrieval results taking into account all the keywords as average precision-recall diagrams. There are four curves that correspond in the case that there is no user feedback as well as in the case that user feedback is applied for one, two and three relevant instances, respec-tively. It can be observed that the user X  X  feedback provides a significant boost to the accuracy of the retrieval results in terms of precision/recall. However, using more than one rel-evant instance may not further increase the retrieval perfor-mance. Indeed, due to the freezing method which is applied in the evaluation process, the relevant words that correspond to the user X  X  selection are kept to their  X  X rozen X  positions instead of being moved to the top positions of the ranking list. This may affect the overall retrieval performance, espe-cially for keywords that have few instances in the documents corpus. Table 2 provides typical retrieval performance mea-sures, namely the 1st Tier, 2nd Tier and the 1-NN metric, in the case of the aforementioned user involvement. 6.3 Word spotting using word-forms In the next set of experiments, the proposed methodology is tested by taking into account the inflected word-forms of each query keyword. For this experimentation, the user X  X  feedback process is not only applied to the keyword but it is also applied to its inflected word-forms. For each of the four working cases (i.e. no feedback, one, two, or three selected relevant words), the final ranking results of the keyword and its inflected word-forms are merged and re-ranked. In this case, the top entries of the final ranking list are instances of the keyword itself or its inflected word-forms.

Figure 14 shows retrieval results for the query key-word  X  X   X  X  o  X  X   X   X  X  X  X   X . According to Table 1 ,thiskeyword has 6 inflected word-forms. Figure 14 ashowsthefirst15 entries of the initial ranking results without user feedback. The check mark denotes segmented words that are relevant instances of the keyword or of one of its inflected word-forms. The three columns in Fig. 14 b X  X  show the retrieval results when the user selects the first one, two or three relevant instances, respectively. Again, the user X  X  feedback increases the retrieval performance.

To provide a comparative evaluation of the word spotting procedure using inflected word-forms, we aim in address-ing retrieval performance in two distinct cases that should be compared against each other. In the first case, a retrieval process is performed in which instances of each query key-word are used without taking into consideration any inflected word-forms, while in the second case, a retrieval process is performed in which it is not only instances of each query keyword which are used but also any corresponding inflected word-forms are taken into consideration. For both cases, the retrieval results are evaluated with respect to the ability of the particular retrieval process to return all relevant word images to the query keyword along with the corresponding inflected word-forms as defined in the ground truth.

Figure 15 shows the retrieval results for all the query key-words in terms of average precision/recall when no inflected word-forms are used (first case). The four curves correspond to no user feedback, one, two and three selected relevant instances, respectively. Table 3 provides further retrieval statistics for this step. It is clearly shown that for this case a low performance is achieved. Figure 16 shows the retrieval results for all the query keywords in terms of average pre-cision/recall when inflected word-forms are used (second case). Additional retrieval statistics for this particular case are given in Table 4 . It can be observed that using inflected word-forms in the word spotting procedure results in signifi-cantly improved retrieval performance when compared to the case where only the query keywords are considered. Table 5 shows processing time requirements. The method has been implemented in Matlab , and the vast majority of computa-tional time concerns the comparison of the synthetic or rel-evant keyword against the 1,06,793 segmented words from all the pages of the document corpus. It should be noticed that these time expenses do not include the time slot that concerns the off-line process, namely the word segmentation and the feature extraction for all the segmented words in the database. 7 Conclusions In this paper, we have described a methodology for accessing the content of digitized Greek historical documents without the use of an optical character recognition system. Access to the documents that were printed during the seventeenth and eighteenth century is based on word spotting using word images created from keywords.

At a first step, we apply a preprocessing step in order to improve the quality of the document image, while word seg-mentation is accomplished with the use of two complemen-tary segmentation methodologies. Then, by using a method of creating synthetic word images from their ASCII equiva-lences we achieved word search while avoiding the process of character recognition that occurs in traditional indexing systems based on OCR. The user is able to further improve the results by selecting the most relevant words from the list of the results and feed them back to the system. User X  X  feedback enables the transition from synthetic queries to real data queries resulting to more accurate searching results. Moreover, query extension and access to the semantic con-tent of the documents are achieved with the use of a synonym dictionary and a morphological generation system. The mor-phological generator constitutes an attempt X  X he first to our knowledge X  X o build a morphological processor able to deal with nominal inflection phenomena in early Modern Greek which represents a transitional period of the language. The experimental results show that using inflected word-forms in the word spotting procedure along with the user X  X  feedback leads to improved retrieval performance when compared to the case where only the query keywords are considered.
