 Identifying similar professionals is an important task for many core services in professional social networks. Infor-mation about users can be obtained from heterogeneous in-formation sources, and different sources provide different in-sights on user similarity.

This paper proposes a discriminative probabilistic model that identifies latent content and graph classes for people with similar profile content and social graph similarity pat-terns, and learns a specialized similarity model for each la-tent class. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on identifying similar professionals in professional so-cial networks, and the first work that identifies latent classes to learn a separate similarity model for each latent class. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effec-tiveness of the proposed discriminative learning model.

Professional social networks (PSNs) are business oriented social networks where many core services such as recruit-ing, job seeking, expert/profile search, item recommenda-tion, ad-targeting, etc. rely on successful identification of similar people. Due to the variety of available activities in PSNs, information about their users can be obtained from many heterogeneous sources such as profile content (e.g., users X  job titles, their industries, specialties/skills, etc.), so-cial graph (e.g., connections, group memberships, etc.) and user activities on the website (e.g., search and profile view-ing, news sharing, etc.). Different sources provide differ-ent insights on user similarity, therefore information coming from these sources needs to be weighted and combined care-fully. For instance; for a pair who do not have similar profile content while having very similar connections (due to com- X

 mon friends, etc.), information from their profile content can be used to decrease the importance of the information from their connectivity for estimating the overall similarity.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work on identifying similar people in professional social networks. Most existing research on identifying similar users or match-ing people (e.g., online dating systems [3]) either used infor-mation from a single/homogeneous source (e.g., user pro-file content [3]), or used information from heterogeneous sources, but did not differentiate the information from these sources in a principled way (e.g., [4]).

In this paper, we propose a discriminative probabilistic model to identify similar professionals in professional social networks. Unlike the prior work, the proposed model iden-tifies latent content and graph classes for people with simi-lar profile content and social graph similarity patterns, and learns a specialized similarity model for each latent class. Experiments on real-world proprietary data from LinkedIn show the effectiveness of the proposed discriminative model.
In a PSN, similarity features indicating whether two peo-ple are similar or not can mainly be grouped into 3 het-erogenous categories: i) profile content features c ; ii) social graph features g ; iii) PSN usage features u . In particular, 5 content similarity features (comparing users X  titles, indus-tries, skills, specialties, associations), 3 social graph features (utilizing users X  common connections, common groups, and whether their profiles are co-viewed or not), and 5 website usage features (utilizing the similarity in profile, search, in-box, news/sharing, accounts/settings page usage patterns) are used in this work. Given the set of similarity features f to denote all the similarity features of a people pair v , i.e., f v = { c v , g v , u v } , the proposed discriminative probabilistic model can be constructed as follows: P ( s v = 1 | f v ) = where s v  X  { 1 ,  X  1 } indicates whether the v th pair is sim-ilar or not, P ( z | c v ) and P ( t | g v ) denote the mixing coeffi-cients which are the probabilities of choosing latent content and graph classes z and t given content and graph features c v and g v . N z and N t are the number of latent content and graph classes and are chosen to be 3 and 2 respec-tively by AIC [1]. P ( s v | z, t, f v ) can be modeled by logis-tic function as P ( s v | z, t, f v ) =  X  ( 1 / (1 + exp (  X  x )) is the standard logistic function and  X  is the weight for the i th feature f v i under the latent classes z and t . The mixing proportions P ( z | c v ;  X  ) can be mod-the normalization factor that scales the exponential func-tion to be a proper probability distribution (i.e., Z c v P z exp(
Th e parameters of the model in Eqn.(1) (  X  ,  X  ,  X  ) can be estimated by the EM algorithm [2]. The E-step can be derived by computing the posterior probability of z and t , i.e. P ( z, t | f v ). By optimizing the auxiliary Q-function, we can derive the following M-step update rules: The update rule for (  X  ) can be achieved similarly with Eqn.(3). Eqns.(2,3) can be optimized by any gradient descent method. In particular, we use the Quasi-Newton method. The pro-posed discriminative probabilistic model that has latent con-tent and social graph classes is referred as Latent C G M od .
For better comparison, similar models that only model la-tent content or social graph classes (namely Latent C M od and Latent G M od respectively) are constructed (each with 3 classes chosen by AIC) as well. All of those discrimina-tive models are compared to a baseline method without any latent class. The baseline method is modeled with logistic regression and is referred as LogReg M od .
We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed models on proprietary data from LinkedIn. As the first step of creat-ing a dataset of similar people, a set of 2200 key profiles (target people for whom similar people will be searched) are selected by intersecting two sets: a) profiles popular among recruiters, and b) profiles popular within general users (sets identified by mining the large-scale recruiter/user activity logs for a time period of 6 months). Next; using Lucene 1 public profiles in the PSN are indexed, and each key profile is used as a structured query to retrieve top 100 candidate profiles for the key profile. From these 100 profiles, 10 can-didate profiles are selected under three strategies: i) top 10, ii) bottom 10; and iii) sampled 10 (i.e., between ranks 1-10, 91-100, and randomly). A total of 22000 profile pairs are identified for annotation. Finally, the CrowdFlower 2 crowd-sourcing service is employed to annotate each people pair with a similarity rating from 1 (being the least similar) to 4 by three annotators. The final rating for each pair is calcu-lated by the average rating weighted by annotator trust.
Pairs with a similarity rating &gt; 2 . 5 are regarded as similar people (with a total of 4633 similar pairs). Due to the can-didate profile selection strategy, all people pairs in the an-notated dataset are above some similarity level, which intro-duces bias in the set of negative (dissimilar) data instances. Therefore, a set of 2419 pairs randomly selected from the set of annotated pairs with similarity rating  X  2, is com-bined with another set of 2373 (less similar) pairs randomly lu cene.apache.org www.crowdflower.com Table 1: Experiment results of the proposed dis-criminative model.

A total of 4792 pairs of profiles are collected as the set of dissimilar people, resulting in a dataset of 9425 profile pairs balanced between positive and negative examples. Two thirds of the data (6283 pairs) are used for training the models, and one third of the data (3142 pairs) is used for testing.
Experiments are conducted on the constructed dataset to evaluate the proposed model. The models are evaluated by the common F 1 measure as precision and recall are both im-portant. It can be seen in Table 1 that both Latent C M od &amp; Latent G M od achieve improvements over LogReg M od ; and the improvement of Latent C M od is comparable with Latent G M od (while slightly better). This set of experi-ments shows that by having higher flexibility via introduc-ing a latent class and allowing the combination weights vary accordingly, improvements can be achieved. Table 1 also shows that the proposed probabilistic discriminative model Latent C G M od achieves the best performance by modeling the latent content and graph classes that provide more flexi-bility than Latent C M od and Latent G M od models, and much more flexibility than the LogReg M od model, lead-ing to its superior performance. This explicitly shows that differentiating the pairs with different profile content and so-cial graph similarity patterns, and specializing the similarity model for different pairs of people that share similar simi-larity patterns is important for achieving higher similarity accuracy.
Identifying similar people is an important task for profes-sional social networks. Different people pairs have different profile content and social graph similarity patterns, and it is important to learn specialized similarity models for peo-ple with different similarity patterns. This paper proposes a discriminative probabilistic model that identifies latent con-tent and graph classes for people with similar profile content and social graph similarity patterns, and learns a special-ized similarity model for each latent class. Experiments on real-world data show the effectiveness of the proposed dis-criminative probabilistic model. [1] H. Akaike. A new look at the statistical model [2] A. Dempster, N. Laird, and D. Rubin.
