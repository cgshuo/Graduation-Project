 information, the research community has focused on real-time location signals (GPS signals) to improve search engine effectiveness. Location signals have been investigated for geographic coordinates to media f iles[1], and to improve mobile search ranking[2]. While the increased focus on real-time user location has produced excellent research, there rema ins a gap between the capabilities being developed in the research community, and the capabilities being developed by commercial sear ch engines. The core of this discrepancy between the advances in research and advances in industry is understanding the user X  X  location. The vast majority of research on user location assumes that the user X  X  location is known, because the user has provided a GPS signal. For many systems, there is no GPS signal available. The user may choose not enable it, or the system chooses not to prompt the user for the location because doing so degrades the user experience. For these interactions, the system relies on the user X  X  IP address for location information. Further, much of the current re search uses public geocoded data such as Foursquare (http://www.foursquare.com visited June 2015), and Twitter ( http://www.twitter.com visited June 2015). These data are an incomplete picture of places a user may visit, The information contained in these data is not the same type of information typically available to a commercial search engine. In this talk we discuss gaps be tween current research on location, and industry advances in using location signals to improve search results. We focus on user location as one example of a gap between research and development. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  retrieval models. Algorithms, Experimentation. User location, local search, contextual ranking. Vanessa Murdock is a Principal Applied Researcher at Microsoft for the past three years. Her research focuses on leveraging social media to improve local search. Previously Dr. Murdock worked at Yahoo! Research in Barcelona, Spain, as a Senior Research Scientist. At Yahoo! Research she led the Geographic Context and Experience Group, doing research on topics related to geographic information retrieval and user-generated content. She has been awarded 8 patents, and has more than 30 patent applications pending, resulting in a Master Inventor Award from Yahoo! (2012). She received the OAA Award for Outstanding Achievement by a Young Alum from the University of Massachusetts in 2014.
 Dr. Murdock publishes regularly in the field of information retrieval, and is active in the scientific community, reviewing for conferences and journals, organizi ng workshops and tutorials, and serving on the organizing committees for international conferences. Dr. Murdock received a B.S. in Computer Science from Colorado State University in 2001 and an M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Dr. Murdock also holds a Bachelor of Music, and worked as a professional musician for 10 years prior to her career in computer science.
