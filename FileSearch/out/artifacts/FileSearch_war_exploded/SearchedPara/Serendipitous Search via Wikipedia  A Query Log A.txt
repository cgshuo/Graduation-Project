 We analyse the query log of a click-oriented Japanese search engine that utilises the link structures of Wikipedia for en-couraging the user to change his information need and to perform repeated, serendipitous, exploratory search. Our results show that users tend to make transitions within the same query type: from person names to person names, from place names to place names, and so on.

Exploratoy search [5], which is beginning to receive a lot of attention, covers not only querying and producing a ranked output, but also forming and changing information need. Twenty years ago, Bates [2] proposed the evolving search and berrypicking models for handling change in information need and what people now call exploratory search.
In September 2008, we released a click-oriented Japanese search engine called KotobaNoUchu (Galaxies of Words), which utilises the link structures of Wikipedia for encourag-ing the user to change his information need and to perform repeated, serendipitous, exploratory search. We thereby aim to provide the user with a lot of useful information that may not be relevant to his initial information need.
We analyse the query log of Galaxies of Words to see how users move from one query to the next on our click-able Galaxy interface, which visualises the link structures of Wikipedia. Studies on Japanese query logs include [1, 3], but none of them addresses the issues of substantial change in information need. In fact, to our knowledge, query log studies in general have tended to overlook these issues. Figure 1 shows a sample search output of Galaxies of Words. Here, the query is  X  X aro Aso X , the current prime minister of Japan. The search output contains several ranked of planets we should present to the user in order to make the serendipitous/exploratory search more successful.
We analysed the query log for the entire month of Octo-ber 2008 (one month after the site was released). We had 806,772 records , where each record is a quadruple of the form: timestamp , Cookie , query before transition , query af-ter transition . We obtained 462,891 user sessions (409,815 users) using thirty minutes as the timeout threshold as in previous studies. Among the above data, only 20,311 ses-sions contained a transition to a planet within the Galaxy. The transition length was 1.19 on average, and 80 at maxi-mum. (This user clicked on a planet 80 times in a row!)
We obtained 13,258 unique queries from the above 20,311 sessions, and manually classified them into the following cat-egories: PERSON , ORG (organisations), TITLE (books, movies, etc.), GROUP (baseball teams, pop groups, etc.), PLACE , ADULT , EVENT , PROFESSION , INCIDENT , DISEASE , PRODUCT , WEBSITE , LAW , ANIMAL , TIME and NO CATEG (no category). We then anal-ysed how users move from one query type to another on the Galaxy interface. Figures 2-6 show some selected results.
Although the distribution is biased towards PERSON planets and ORG planets because they have the highest chance of being shown to the user, it can be observed that users tend to move within the same query type: from person names to person names, from place names to place names, and so on. This is true for other query types not shown in the figure: For example, the chance of moving from an EVENT query to another EVENT query is about 24%; that of moving from a DISEASE query to another DIS-EASE query is about 38%.
We showed that, on our clickable Galaxy interface for serendipitous search, users tend to make transitions within the same query type: from person names to person names, from place names to place names, and so on. We plan to utilise this finding for selecti ng good planets and for prun-ing planets that are probably less useful. We also plan to customise the Galaxy based on clicks for each user.
