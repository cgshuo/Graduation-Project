 Word segmentation is a challe nging issue, and the corresponding algorithms can be used in many applications of natural language processing. This paper addresses the problem of Vietnamese word segmentation, proposes a probab ilistic ensemble learning (PEL) framework, and designs a novel PEL-based word segmentation (PELWS) algorithm. Supported by the data structure of syllable-syllable frequency index, the PELWS algorithm combines multiple weak segmenters to form a strong segmenter within the PEL framework. The experimental results show that the PELWS algorithm can achieve the state-of-the-art performance in the Vietnamese word segmentation task.

Like Thai, Japanese and Chinese text, Vietnamese text is also a text without any explicit separator between words. Thus, identifying the word boundaries is crucial to above oriental languages in many applications of natural language processing (NLP) [1]. For instance, the following Sentence1 is a raw unsegmented Vietnamese se ntence, and the following Sentence2 is its related segmented one. weighted-voting-like strategy. Figure 1 shows the PEL framework for Vietnamese word segmentation. The framework mainly includes several pairs of &lt;Segme nter, PELearner (Probabilistic Ensemble Learner)&gt; and a PEPredictor (Probabilistic Ensemble Predictor). The Segmenters are implemented from different Vietnamese word segmentation algorithms. For each Segmenter, we design and install a PELearner, which receives golden standard segmented texts and au tomatic segmented texts from its corresponding Segmenter, and learns a probabilistic ensemble model from both two texts. The probabilistic ensemble model is stored as a syllable-syllabl e frequency index (SSFI). The PEPredictor combines multi-segmenter X  X  segmented texts according to the SSFIs and makes the final prediction for each unsegmented text. Figure 2 shows the SSFI structure organized as a hash table. The each key S i S j denotes a sequence of continuous two syllables and each value consists of 4 integers. The integer f c ( X ) denotes the times of correct prediction and the integer f m ( X ) denotes the times of mistaken prediction. The symbol ('_') means that the continuous two syllables S i and S j are in a word, and the symbol (' word. The hash function hash ( S i S j ) maps the sequence S i S j to the address of the 4 integers. Supported by the SSFI, we design a supervised PELWS algorithm, which regards the historical precision as an ensemble probability and uses it as an ensemble weighted coefficient. Figure 3 gives the pseudo-code for the PELWS algorithm consisting of two main functions: pep and pel . The PELWS algorithm takes the predicting process as an index retrieving process and takes the PEL proce ss as an index updating process. When an unsegmented ( sss = null) text arrives, the pep function will be triggered: ( I ) It calls each Vietnamese word segmenter for multiple segmented result texts; ( II ) It retrieves the current SSFI and calculates a probabilistic score according to the historical precision described in Eq. (1) for each space symbol '  X  ' in each The PELWS algorithm, independent of any concrete segmenter, is a general meta-algorithm, whose space-time complexity mainly depends on the SSFI storage space and the segment loops in the pep and the pel functions. The SSFI is space-efficient owing to the inherent compressible property of index files. Theoretically, the property ensures that the SSFI storage space is proportional to the total number of continuous tw o syllables and is independent of the number of training texts. The updating or retrieving of SSFI has constant time complexity according to the hash function. The maximal space complexity O (np) and the maximal time complexity O (nq) of the PEL framework are both acceptable in practical NLP applications. Here, n means the number of segmenters, usually a low num ber; p means the number of continuous two syllables; and q m eans the total number of texts. According to the PELWS algorithm, we firstly implement a PELSegmenter (PEL), which combines three existing weak segmenters: vnTokenizer 1 (VNT), RMMSegmenter (RMM) and MMSegmenter 2 (MM). The VNT is an implementation of the hybrid word segmentation algorithm. The RMM and the MM are implemented from the dictionary-based reverse maximum matching algorithm and the dicti onary-based maximum matching algorithm respectively. Secondly, we implement a simple ensemble learning segmenter: SELSegmenter (SEL) as the baseline, which applies a simple majority rule to combine the VNT, RMM and MM. The SEL resembles a simplified PELSegmenter without probabilistic ensemble learners. Because the VNT, RMM and MM all support dictionary extension and the PELWS algorithm is a supervised algorithm, we can add all words of training texts into the dictionary and build three corresponding enhanced segm enters. Finally, we can get two enhanced segmenters: enha nced PEL and enhanced SEL through combining the three enhanced segmenters. In the experiment, we use a public ly available benchmark dataset (Corpus for Vietnamese Word Segmentation 3 , CVWS), which contains total 7807 sentences with word boundary labels from 305 Vietnamese newspaper artic les in various domains. The international Bakeoff [11] evaluation measure and associated evaluation methodology are applied. In the experiment, we report the classical Precision (P), Recall (R), F1-measure (F1) and Error Rate (ER) to evaluate the result of segmenters. The value of P, R, F1 belongs to [0, 1], where 1 is optimal, while the value of ER belongs to [0, 1], where 0 is optimal. http://vlsp.vietlp.org:8080/demo /?page=resources&amp;tool=tokenizer. http://cbd.nichesite.org/CBD2013S002.htm. http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~hieuxuan/vnwordseg/data. Figure 5. Experimental result of the enhanced segmenters. In part two, we run the five e nhanced segmenters respectively. Figure 5 presents the experiment al result, which shows that ( I ) the four measures of each enhanced segmenter excel that of corresponding original segmenter, for instance, the ER value of VNT and enhanced VNT is 0.122 and 0.075 respectively; and ( II ) the four measures of enhanced PEL are the best ones, for instance, the F1 value of enhanced PEL is the best 0.945. The experimental result verifies that the PELWS algorithm can combine weak segmenters with an enhanced dictionary to form a strong segmenter, which can achieve the optimal performance and even exceeds the performance of some advanced machine learning algorithms for word segmentation. This paper elucidates that our PEL framework can take advantage of complementary virtues from di fferent algorithms, and is very useful to improve the perform ance of existing algorithms for Vietnamese word segmentation. Moreover, the PEL framework is suitable to parallel running environment. If the PEL framework is deployed on the reduplicate hardware for multi-segmenter, the computational time to segment a text will theoretically near to the lowest segmenter X  X  running time. Further research will concern other sequence labeling problems (such as named entity recogniti on, POS tagging, parsing, and semantic role labeling) with in the PEL framework. We will transfer above research productions to other suitable oriental languages like Thai, Japanese, Chinese, and so on. [1] Doan Nguyen. 2008. Query preprocessing: improving web
