 It is typical that applications for biomedical text involve the use of natural language syntactic pars-ers as one of the first steps in processing. Thus, the performance of the system as a whole is largely dependent on how well the natural language syn-tactic parsers perform. One of the challenges in parsing biomedical text is that it is significantly more complex than articles in typical English text. Different analysis show other problematic characteristics, including inconsistent use of nouns and partial words (Tateisi &amp; Tsujii, 2004), higher perplexity measures (Elhadad, 2006), greater lexical density, plus increased number of relative clauses and prepositional phrases (Ge-moets, 2004), all of which correlate with dimi-nished comprehension and higher text difficulty. These characteristics also lead to performance problems in terms of computation time and accura-cy for parsers that are trained on common English text corpus.
 We identified three categories of sentences: 1) normal English sentences, like in Newswire text, 2) normal biomedical English sentences  X  those sentences which can be parsed without a problem by Link Grammar-, and 3) complex biomedical English sentences  X  those sentences which can X  X  be parsed by Link Grammar. Aside from the known characteristics mentioned before, sentences in the third group tended to be longer (18% of them had more than 50 words, while only 8% of those in group 2 and 2% of those in group 1 did). It has been observed that parsers perform well with sen-tences of reduced length (Chandrasekar &amp; Srini-vas, 1997; Siddharthan, 2006). In this paper, we explore the use of text simplif i-cation as a preprocessing step for general parsing to reduce length and complexity of biomedical sen-tences in order to enhance the performance of the parsers. There are currently many publicly available corpo-ra of biomedical texts, the most popular among them being BioInfer, Genia, AImed, HPRD 50, IEPA, LLL and BioCreative1-PPI. Among these corpora, BioInfer includes the most comprehensive collection of sentences and careful annotation for links of natural parser, in both the Stanford and Link Grammar schemes. Therefore, we chose the BioInfer corpus, version 1.1.0 (Pyysalo et al., 2007), containing 1100 sentences for evaluating the effectiveness of our simplification method on the performance of syntactic parsers. The method includes syntactic and non-syntactic transforma-tions, detailed next. 2.1 Non-syntactic transformation We group here three steps of our approach: 1. pre-processing through removal of spurious phrases; 2. replacement of gene names; 3. replacement of noun phrases. To improve the correctness of the parsing, each biomedical sentence is first preprocessed to re-move phrases that are not essential to the sentence . This includes removal of section indicators , which are phrases that specify the name of the section at the beginning of the sentence, plus the removal of phrases in parentheses (such as citations and num-bering in lists). Also, partially hyphenated words are transformed by combining with the nearest word that follows or precedes the partial hyphe-nated word to make a meaningful word. For in-stance, the phrase  X  X lpha-and beta-catenin X  is transformed into  X  X lpha-catenin and beta-catenin X . Occurrences of multi-word technical terms and entity names involved in biomedical processes are common in biomedical text. Such terms are not likely to appear in the dictionary of a parser (per -plexity is high), and will force it to use morpho-guessing and unknown word guessing. This is time consuming and prone to error. Thus, unlike typical text simplification that emphasizes syntactic trans -formation of sentences, our approach utilizes a named entity recognition engine, BANNER (Leaman &amp; Gonzalez, 2008), to replace multi-word gene names with single-word placeholders. Replacement of gene names with single elements is not enough, however, and grammatical category (i.e. singular or plural) of the element has to be considered. Lingpipe (Alias-i, 2006), a shallow parser for biomedical text, identifies noun phrases and replaces them with single elements. A single element is considered singular when the following verb indicates a third-person singular verb or the determiner preceded by the element is either  X  X  X  or  X  X n X . Otherwise it is considered as plural and an  X  X  X  is attached to the end of the element. 2.2 Syntactic transformation The problem of simplifying long sentences in common English text has been studied before, not-ably by Chandrasekar &amp; Srinivas (1997) and Sidd-harthan (2006). However, the techniques used in these studies might not totally solve the issue of parsing biomedical sentences. For example, using Siddharthan X  X  approach, the biological finding  X  X he Huntington's disease protein interacts with p53 and CREB-binding protein and represses tran-scription X , and assuming multi-word nouns such as  X  X REB-binding protein X  do not present a problem, would be simplified to:  X  X he Huntington's disease protein interacts with p53. The Huntington's disease protein interacts with CREB-binding protein. The Huntington's disease protein represses transcription. X  Our method transforms it to  X  X ENE1 interacts with GENE2 and GENE3 and represses transcrip-tion. X  Both decrease the average sentence length, but the earlier distorts the biological meaning (since the Huntington X  X  disease protein might not repress transcription on its own), while the latter signifies it. While replacement of gene names and noun phrases can reduce the sentence length, there are cases when the sentences are still too complex to be parsed efficiently. We developed a simple algo-rithm that utilizes linkages (specific grammatical relationships between pairs of words in a sentence) of the Link Grammar parser (Sleator, 1998) and punctuations for splitting sentences into clauses. An example in Figure 1 illustrates the main part of the algorithm. Each linkage has a primary link type in CAPITAL followed by secondary link type in short. The intuition behind the algorithm is to try to identify independent clauses from complex sen-tences. The first step is to split the sentence ST into clauses c 1 , c 2 , c 3 and c 4 based on commas. c parsed using the Link Grammar parser, but c 1 can-not be a sentence as there is no  X  X  X  link in the li n-kage of c 1 . c 2 is then attached to c 1 and the linkage of  X  c 1 , c 2  X  does not contain a  X  X  X  link as well.  X  c c , c 3 . X  is recognized as a sentence, since the lin-kage contains an  X  X  X  link, indicating that it is a sentence, as well as the linkage of c 4 . So the algo-rithm returns two sentences ST 1 and ST 2 for ST . Our method has the greatest impact on the perfor-mance of Link Grammar (LG), which lies at the core of BioLG (Pyysalo et al., 2006). However, it also has a significant impact on the self-training biomedical parser by McClosky &amp; Charniak (CM), which is currently the best parser available for biomedical text. 3.1 Rudimentary statistics of the results of sim-plification: After the simplification algorithm was tested on the 1100 annotated sentences of the Bio-Infer corpus, there were 1159 simplified sentences because of syntactic transformation (section 2.2). The number of words per sentence showed a sharp drop of 20.4% from 27.0 to 21.5. The Flesh-Kincaid score for readability dropped from 17.4 to 14.2. The Gunning Fog index also dropped by 18.3% from 19.7 to 16.1.
 3.2 Impact of simplification on the efficiency of parsing: We inputted the BioInfer corpus to LG and CM. If LG cannot find a complete linkage, it invokes its panic mode , where sentences are re-turned with considerably low accuracy. Out of the 1100 original sentences in the corpus, 219 went into panic mode. After processing, only 39 out of 1159 simplified sentences triggered panic mode (a 16.4% improvement in efficiency). The average time for parsing a sentence also dropped from 7.36 secs to 1.70 secs after simplification. 3.3 Impact of simplification on the accuracy of parsing: Let  X  g,  X  o and  X  s, respectively be the sets containing the links of the gold standard, the output generated by the parser on original sen-tences and the output generated by the parser on simplified sentences. We denote a link of type  X  between the tokens  X  1 and  X  2 by (  X  ,  X  1 ,  X  2 ). In the case of the original sentences, the tokens  X  1 and  X  2 are single-worded. So, (  X  ,  X  1 ,  X  2 ) is a true positive iff (  X  ,  X  1 ,  X  2 ) belongs to both  X  g and  X  o, false posi-tive iff it only belongs to  X  o and false negative iff it only belongs to  X  g. In the case of simplified sen-tences, the tokens  X  1 and  X  2 can have multiple words. So, (  X  ,  X  1 ,  X  2 ) which belongs to  X  s is a true positive iff (  X  ,  X   X  1 ,  X   X  2 ) belongs to  X  g where and  X   X  2 are respectively one of the words in  X  1 and  X  . Additionally, (  X  ,  X  1 ,  X  2 ) which belongs to  X  g is not a false negative if  X  1 and  X  2 are parts of a sin-gle token of a simplified sentence. For measuring the performance of a parser, the nature of linkage is most relevant in the context of the sentence in consideration. So, we calculate precision and recal l for each sentence and average them over all sen-tences to get the respective precision and recall f or the collection. In order to compare the effect of BioSimplify on the two parsers, a converter from Link Grammar to Stanford scheme was used (Pyysalo et al, 2007: precision and recall of 98% and 96%). Results of this comparision are shown in Table 2. On CM and LG, we were able to achieve a considerable im-provement in the f-measures by 2.90% and 4.23% respectively. CM demonstrated an absolute error reduction of 4.1% over its previous best on a dif-ferent test set. Overall, bioSimplify leverages par s-ing of biomedical sentences, increasing both the efficiency and accuracy. During the creation of BioInfer, noun phrase ma-cro-dependencies were determined using a simple rule set without parsing. Some of the problems re-lated to parsing noun phrases were removed by reducing the number of words by more than 20%. BioLG enhances LG by expansion of lexicons and the addition of morphological rules for biomedical domain. Our work differs from BioLG not only in utilizing a gene name recognizer, a specialized shallow parser and syntactic transformation, but also in creating a preprocessor that can improve th e performance of any parser on biomedical text. The idea of improving the performance of deep parsers through the integration of shallow and deep parsers has been reported in (Crysmann et al., 2002; Daum et al., 2003; Frank et al., 2003) for non-biomedical text. In BioNLP, extraction sys-tems (Jang et al., 2006; Yakushiji et al., 2001) us ed shallow parsers to enhance the performance of deep parsers. However, there is a lack of evalua-tion of the correctness of the dependency parses, which is crucial to the correctness of the extracte d systems. We not only evaluate the correctness of the links, but also go beyond the problem of rela-tionship extraction and empower future researchers in leveraging their parsers (and other extraction systems) to get better results. We achieved an f-measure of 78.86% using CM on BioInfer Corpus which is a 2.90% absolute reduc-tion in error. We achieved a 4.23% absolute reduc-tion in error using LG. According to the measures described in section 3.1, the simplified sentences of BioInfer outperform the original ones by more than 18%. Our method can also be used with other parsers. As future work, we will demonstrate the impact of our simplification method on other text mining tasks, such as relationship extraction.
