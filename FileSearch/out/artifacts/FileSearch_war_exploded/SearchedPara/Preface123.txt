 Fabio Crestani  X  Paolo Ferragina  X  Mark Sanderson This volume contains a selection of papers presented at the 13th International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval (SPIRE), held October 11 X 13, 2006, in Glasgow, Scotland.

The SPIRE annual symposium provides an opportunity for both new and established researchers to present original contributions to areas such as  X  string processing X  X ictionary algorithms, text searching, pattern matching, text  X  information retrieval languages, applications, and evaluation X  X R modeling, indexing,  X  interaction of biology and computation X  X equencing and applications in molecular
The accepted publications in the conference were selected from 102 papers submitted from over 20 countries in response to the Call for Papers. A total of 26 + 5 submissions were accepted as full and short papers respectively. Of those a number were invited to be expanded for inclusion in this special issue of the journal. Each of the papers underwent two rounds of reviews by external reviewers and by the Editors of the Special Issue, thus eventually ensuring a high-level of correctness and significance of the scientific contribution.

The papers selected cover the range of SPIRE subjects:  X  X  X utput-Sensitive Autocom-pletion Search X  X  by Bast, Mortensen and Weber who present a novel data structure that allows auto-completion of user queries to be executed rapidly. The structure is of similar size to an inverted file. Esuli, Fagni and Sebastiani in  X  X  X oosting Multi-label Hierarchical Text Categorization X  X  present a variation of the AdaBoost.MH algorithm that deals with categorization of documents into hierarchical categories. The algorithm is shown to be successful both in terms of efficiency and accuracy. Providing means to better deal with ranking of documents based on multiple sources of evidence is described in  X  X  X n Out-ranking Approach for Information Retrieval X  X  by Farah and Vanderpooten. Here the authors argue that previous approaches to ranking that use multiple attributes fail to handle the imprecision often present in some attributes. They describe their novel procedure for dealing with forms of attribute and show through experimentation that their approach works well compared to common alternatives.

Moving from Information Retrieval focused research to String Processing, Fredriksson and Grabowski in  X  X  X fficient algorithms for pattern matching with general gaps, character classes and transposition invariance X  X  address a particular class of pattern matching problem in which gaps are allowed in the pattern being searched, including so-called negative gaps. Finally,  X  X  X  Compressed Self-Index using a Ziv-Lempel Dictionary X  X , by Russo and Oliveira describes a compressed self-index which improves on previous approaches by reducing search time complexity from quadratic to linear time in the size of the searched pattern.

We would like to thank Ricardo Baeza-Yates, who, on behalf of the Steering Com-mittee, invited us to organize SPIRE 2006 and supported us at every step of the way. Thanks also are due to the program committee members who helped us with the additional reviewing.

 EDITORIAL Faisal Shafait  X  Dimosthenis Karatzas  X  Seiichi Uchida  X  Masakazu Iwamura Document Image Analysis (DIA) was established to address the need for the automated analysis of scanned paper docu-ments, but has evolved to incorporate a great variety of text containers including digital-born (Web and email) images, scene images, and video sequences. These types of text con-tainers introduce a range of new challenges for reading sys-tems, stemming from perspective distortions, a large vari-ety of fonts and backgrounds, anti-aliasing, and compression artefacts. Addressing the need of reading textual content in such domains entails a paradigm shift in the DIA field that calls for a change in the definition of  X  X ocument X  to include complex unconstrained text containers, as opposed to the tra-ditional scanned paper document. Robust Reading refers to the research area dealing with the interpretation of written communication in unconstrained settings.

Robust Reading is generally perceived as the detection and recognition of textual information in scene images, but in the wider sense it refers to techniques and methodologies that have been developed specifically for complex text con-tainers beyond scanned paper documents. Robust Reading is at the meeting point between camera-based document analy-sis and scene interpretation and serves as common ground between the DIA community and the wider computer vision community.

To gauge research progress in the field of text recognition in unconstrained environments, the ICDAR Robust Read-ing Competitions (held in 2003, 2005, 2011, 2013, 2015) have become the defacto international benchmark and pro-vide standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and soft-ware for the scientific community. The first two editions of the competition in 2003 and 2005 focused on detec-tion and recognition of scene text. Research in this topic was in its infancy at that stage, so the competitions did not receive large participation and were discontinued. However, research in this direction gained momentum in the follow-ing years owing largely to the rapid proliferation of smart-phone devices having built-in cameras. The ground-truthed datasets developed for ICDAR 2003 competition became a yardstick to evaluate algorithms for scene text detection and recognition. The ICDAR Robust Reading competition was revived in 2011 to provide a standardized platform for researchers for evaluation of their algorithms. Besides scene text detection and recognition, an additional dimension of extracting text from Born-Digital images (e.g. images in spam emails, or advertisements on Web pages) was added. This time, the competition received tremendous success with participation from 36 teams in different challenges and tasks. Hence, the competition was held again in 2013 including reading text from videos as an additional chal-lenge receiving 58 public submissions and more than 1800 private submissions during the year after the competition. The 2015 edition of the competition, ongoing at the time of writing, includes evaluation of end-to-end text recogni-tion systems keeping in view the maturity of this research field.
The IJDAR Special Issue on Robust Reading provides a snapshot of the state-of-the-art algorithms. A call for papers was circulated to solicit original works on topics related to the detection, extraction, and recognition of textual content in complex unconstrained text containers. In response to the call,18submissionswerereceivedforthisspecialissue.After two review rounds, four papers were accepted for publication in this Special Issue leading to an acceptance rate of 22%. In selecting the papers for this special issue from the wide range of work being done in this area, we focused on research topics that we believe have the broadest range of applicability to the communityworkinginRobustReading.ThepaperbyChang-song Liu et al. discusses a model-free dewarping approach for rectification of camera-captured document images, which is a key prerequisite for accurate recognition of such docu-ments. Yirui Wu et al. present a pre-processing approach for recognition of text in videos. The presented method per-forms thinning that preserves visual topology of characters in videos to achieve higher text recognition rates. The paper by Shijian Lu et al. presents a scene text extraction tech-nique that automatically detects and segments text based on edges from scene images. Finally, Muhammad Fraz et al. demonstrate that the colour information within an image is good enough to distinguish text regions from the surround-ing noise and effectively utilizing this information results in a significant performance improvement for the recognition of characters and words.

We would like to thank the authors who contributed to this special issue and express our gratitude to the reviewers who did a tremendous job within tight deadlines. Finally, we are indebted to Springer support staff as well as the IJDAR Editors-in-Chief X  X rof Koichi Kise, Prof Daniel Lopresti, and Prof Simone Marinai X  X or their constant support and understanding in completing this effort.
