 Complex networks constitute an efficacious formalism to represent the relationships among the objects composing many real world systems. One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of networks is to identify communities, i.e. the division of a network into groups of nodes having dense interconnections and sparse interconnections. Communities in networks often overlap [1], i.e. some nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Searching for overlapped communities is usually much more computationally demanding than detecting standard partitions. 
In this paper we propose a new algorithm, named SAEC. We calculate the similarity between edges and use spectral analysis to derive overlapped communities partition. Experiments on randomly generated and real networks show the capability of the SAEC approach to correctly detect communities compared to the k-clique approaches. Commonly used community detection algorithm[2-6] can be partitioned to two categories: agglomeration method and splitting method. Recently some improvement methods were put forward to detect overlapped communities, e.g. K-Clique algorithm[1]. These algorithms are designed to reveal overlapped communities in the network, but they also have some limitations, such as parameter selection. 
Now there are some methods of communities division employing Spectral analysis[7-9], Many experiments showed that spectral analysis is better than the common clustering algorithm, especially in the high-dimensional data. Spectral analysis commonly used heuristics-based eigen gap to determine k. Ideally, if a data set containing k clusters, there is a big gap between the first k larger eigenvalues and the back k+1 smaller eigenvalues of corresponding laplacian matrix L, be termed eigen gap. We can arrange eigenvalue from big to small order based on this heuristic rule and find the value of k that satisfies . Meila and Shi[10] interpreted the similarity between two nodes as random walk probability of Markov chain and tried to use eigenvector of transfer probability matrix to cluster nodes. Azran and Ghahramani[11] present the k value that based on the eigen gap of transfer probability matrix after the M step random walk is more accurate and more close to the real number of clustering than that based on the eigen gap of laplacian matrix L. SAEC (Spectral Analysis based on Edge Clustering) use line graph[12] to represent this relationship and cluster these edges which reflect this relationship by spectral analysis. Since one node may be associated with multiple edges, as different edges are clustered into different communities, nodes are accordingly partitioned to different communities, so we can find the overlapped nodes by this means. 
In order to implement the SAEC algorithm, we need to construct the similarity matrix. We consider the similarity matrix as the set of all similarity between data points. Here we define the similarity between two nodes as formula 1. As shown in the formula 1, if two nodes and which are in line graph share the same node k, this two nodes similarity can be understood as the number of common neighbor nodes of them. in order to avoid the emergence of isolated nodes and achieve relatively average partition, is added as the denominator in formula 1. Obviously if the two nodes of line graph do not enjoy sharing node, then their similarity is equal to 0. If represents the set of neighbor nodes i and E represents the set of all edges of original node topology graph, then . Transfer probability matrix , is diagonal matrix  X  the definition as follows: SAEC performs the following steps:  X  1  X  Construct the similarity matrix according formula (1).  X  2  X  Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of transfer  X  3  X  Arrange the eigenvalues from big to small order and find out k values that  X  4  X  Construct an n*k matrix H according to the corresponding eigenvector of  X  5  X  Call K-means algorithm for matrix H and partition node i to  X  6  X  Pick out the overlapped nodes whose community property are greater than In order to validate SAEC, we employ the network data sets that randomly generated by the computer and the real network data sets. Fig.1 is the description of the network diagram randomly generated by computer. Fig.1(a) is the experimental results by using K-Clique algorithm. Fig.1(b) is the experimental result by using SAEC algorithm that proposed in this paper. Different colors represent different communities, red triangle nodes denote overlapped nodes. 
As can be seen from the graph, K-Cliq ue algorithm can detect the overlapped community structure, the overlapping nodes are {3,10,11,12}. The SAEC algorithm based on the transfer probability matrix P reaches the maximal eigenvalues gap the overlapped nodes {3,10,11,12}, the othe r overlapped nodes {4,17,22} are detected by SAEC algorithm, this is due to SAEC algorithm excavate communities based on the edge information. The edges like edge (5,22) is partitioned to the communities, so the nodes in edge X  X  two ends are also partitioned to a community. SAEC algorithm partition edge (5,22) to green lines indicated community, meanwhile edge (20, 22) is partitioned to blue lines indicated community, so there is no doubt that the node 22 is a overlapped node. 
In real data sets, we use part of data in scientific collaboration network that provided by CFinder 1 . As shown in Fig.2, different colors represent different communities, and red triangle nodes represent overlapped nodes. Using SAEC algorithm and K-Clique algorithm separately, the results show that communities structure and overlapped node for scientific collaboration network are the same too. The paper presented an algorithm, namely SAEC, to detecting overlapped communities in complex networks. Experiments on randomly generated and the scientific collaboration network showed the capability of the SAEC algorithm to correctly detect overlapped communities. Future research will aim at applying other factors, e.g. the node preference, and deriving more accurate and effective communities division. Acknowledgments.
