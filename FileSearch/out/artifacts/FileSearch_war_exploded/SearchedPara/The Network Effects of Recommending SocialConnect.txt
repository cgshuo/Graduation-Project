 Social networking sites have begun to be used in the enter-prise as a method of connecting employees. Recommender systems may be used to recommend social contacts in order to increase user engagement, encourage collaboration and facilitate expertise discovery. This paper evaluates the ef -fects of four recommendation algorithms on the network as a whole and the social structure. We demonstrate that de-pending on the basis of the recommendation algorithm the effects on the network vary greatly and their potential im-pact should be understood. It is hoped this research can be used as guidance for future recommendation algorithms.

The power of social networks lies in the delicacies and rationale behind the connections. The result is a network graph with  X  X mall world X  properties that have high cluster-ing of communities and a short network distance through ties between these communities. Communities with strong social ties foster trust and communication within the community. On the other hand, a lack on connections to new communi-ties may cause isolation of the group and may have impor-tant implications in terms of information diffusion, cross d i-vision collaboration and knowledge sharing. Much research has focused exploring the relationship of social structure a nd knowledge creation. People who provide brokering connec-tions between communities are more likely to connect people with different ideas, interests and perspectives. Burt foun d that cohesive communities within organizations of similar people may reduce creativity and those who intersect with several communities are more likely to be the source of good ideas [1]. Uzzi and Spiro analyzed a network of creative artists who made Broadway musicals, and found a relation-ship between the small world properties of the collaborativ e network and the probability of a show X  X  success [12].
Recommender systems can be used to recommend social contacts. Little work has been done to measure the effects of these recommendations on the network as a whole and the social structure. A social network consists of people, and people have limited resources when it comes to maintaining relationships, providing information and dealing with com-munication. In contrast when recommending items such as books and movies, the limited resource constraint maybe less problematic. The rich-get-richer phenomenon has been ac-knowledged to reduce diversity and favor older items, result -ing in suppressing potentially better matches [4]. However , the implications of a recommendation algorithm leading to a book becoming a best seller has a significantly different impact when we consider the same algorithm applied to peo-ple. A heavily recommended person in an organization that becomes the most connected may gain unfair advantage, be-come overworked, overexposed or a bottleneck. As a result, people recommendation algorithms in social networks need to consider the upper limits of the number of social ties a per -son can reasonably maintain [3]. The importance of social structure is widely recognized, however, the  X  X deal X  struc ture is of much debate. If a recommender system is to influence the social structure, a delicate balance of these different c on-cerns should be kept in mind when creating or encouraging additional social connections in a network graph.
Previous research on people recommendations has focused on user acceptance, perceived user satisfaction, and impac t on site activity. Guy et al. measure the impact of people rec-ommendations on the number of friends. Their data demon-strates a significant increase in social connections and sho ws that presenting evidence is a crucial element for user satis-faction and acceptance [8]. Chen et al. evaluate four differ-ent recommender algorithm in an enterprise social network site [2]. They found that algorithms using social network in -formation have higher acceptance rates than content-based user matches based on online profile information. The lat-ter algorithms however, are better at helping users to dis-cover new friends. This phenomenon is similar to the over-specialization in recommender systems [13], i.e. social alg o-rithms recommend more of the same (i.e. in this case known people) whereas content-based approaches add diversity at the cost of lower acceptance. Freyne et al. [6] analyze the effect of people and content recommendation on retention rates of newcomers and show that people recommendations can increase long-term retention and user activity, in par-ticular when recommending active users. Terveen and Mc-Donald [11] provide a comprehensive, general overview of so-cial matching systems with the goal of creating a framework that helps researchers understand the design space. Our research aims at determining the impact of different recom-mendation algorithms on the social network structure and addresses some of the questions raised in [11]. We evaluate the after effect of four recommendation algorithms previ-ously deployed in the IBM Research social networking site, Social Blue (formerly known as beehive) [2].
Our analysis is based on a dataset from a large user study conducted by Chen et al. in July 2008 [2]. They deployed four different recommendation algorithms to four different groups of IBM X  X  SocialBlue social network site. The dataset used in this paper consists of 600 users per recommendation group. At the time of the study, the site had more than 38,000 registered users with an average of 8.2 friends per user. The four different algorithms differ in the amount of social network information used [2]: Content Matching : Users are recommended based on their similarity to other users on the site. Similarity of two users is measured by thei r cosine similarity of the TF-IDF weights of keywords derived from their online profile content. Content-plus-Link : This algorithm enhances the Content Matching algorithm with social link information derived from the social network str uc-ture, i.e. in addition to the keyword match the algorithm also shows the network path to the recommended person if it X  X  shorter than or equal to 3 links. Friend-of-Friend : This popular algorithm (used on facebook.com and other social media sites) is based solely on social network struc-ture. It assumes that  X  X f my friend likes someone, I might be interested in that person too. X  SONAR : The people rec-ommendations are generated by the social network service SONAR [7], which aggregates relationship information from a multitude of different public data sources within IBM in-cluding the organizational chart, patent and publications , several friending systems, a people tagging and a blogs.
We utilize social network analysis techniques to evaluate and explore the results of the social recommender experi-ment in [2].  X  Degree  X  centrality is measured as the number of contacts of a given user [5]. A user with high degree central-ity maintains numerous contacts and can be seen as popular. As a result, a central user occupies a structural position th at may act as a conduit for information exchange. In contrast, peripheral users with few or no contacts are located at the margins of the network and do not have much ability to propagate information.  X  Betweenness  X  centrality measures the extent to which a user lies on the shortest paths linking other users [5]. Betweenness centrality can be regarded as a measure of the extent to which a user has control over information flowing between others. A user with a high be-tweenness centrality has a capacity to facilitate interact ions between others that are otherwise separated.  X  Modularity  X  is a measure that defines the quality of a particular division of a network [10]. The modularity based on a division is a value between -1 and 1 that measures the density of links inside communities as compared to links between communities.
The social graph of the entire network before the recom-mendation experiment is computed. The connections cre-ated as a result of each recommendation algorithm are iden-tified and four post-recommendation graphs are built to rep-resent the effect of each recommendation algorithm. ity distribution for all recommended friends using the dif-ferent algorithms. The Friend-of-Friend algorithm has a higher portion of recommended users with a large number of friends. The Content Matching algorithm on the other hand has a high portion of users with few or no contacts at all. The impact of the Friend-of-Friend favoring of users with an already large social network is also seen in the accepted recommendations shown in figure 1 b). All other three algo-rithms enabled connections to users with a relatively lower number of social contacts.
Depending on the matching criteria for recommendation algorithms, certain users may have a clear advantage over others. For example, in the Friend-of-Friend algorithm, a user with a wider social circle has a higher probability of friendship overlap and therefore may be recommended fre-quently to many different users. This bias to already well connected individuals will result in the recommended users becoming even more connected. In figure 2 a) we see that a single user was recommended to a total of 255 users, which is more than 50% of the Friend-of-Friend experiment group. This single user gained 16 new contacts from being recom-mended as as shown in figure 2. Content based recommen-dations, in contrast, have produced more personalized rec-ommended contacts for each participant with the majority density plot.
 See: cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vioplot/vioplot.p df Figure 2: Frequency of User Recommended as a Connection only being recommended to 10 users or less and only a max-imum of 2 new contacts for a single user arose from being recommended. As a result, no single user becomes a clear winner in this algorithm and distributes the recommmenda-tions more evenly throughout the member space.
Figure 3 a) shows the delta in betweenness centrality of users that were recommended. Content Matching has the least impact on the recommended users. The other three algorithms have similar distributions, however, SONAR re-sulted in a single user increasing their betweenness centra lity by the highest amount.

Figure 3 b) shows that the Content Matching algorithm shows the highest increase in betweenness centrality for a connecting user, i.e. the new connections gained by the user placed the participant in a role of connecting users that wer e previously disconnected. Though the Friend-of-Friend algo -rithm resulted in the most new connections, it shows the least overall increase in betweenness centrality for the gr oup participants. This is a result of recommending connections that are already indirectly member of the user X  X  social cir-cle. The user that shows the highest increase in betweenness centrality was recommended to %50 of the participants, and 16 users accepted this recommendation. Therefore it took a large number of new connections to increase this users social capital. In contrast, the users whose betweenness centrality was most affected by the Content Matching al-gorithm only added a single connection, meaning this one new connection had a high impact on the network structure and provided a link to previously unconnected users. The SONAR algorithm also proved to have significant impact on the participating users, again encouraging links between diverse communities.
Table 2 shows that the Friend-of-Friend and SONAR algo-rithms recommend less users from the same countries than recommendations based on content. Given the IBM mem-bers in beehive span 64 different countries, recommenda-tions based on Content Matching lead to a surprising bias towards recommending users from the same country. All algorithms showed a reduced modularity and therefore in clustering based on country location. The SocialBlue mem-bers belong to over 300 different organizational divisions. All algorithms showed a bias in recommending users that (a) Recommended Users
Figure 3: The delta in betweenness centrality for users are within the same division. However SONAR is the only algorithm that explicitly takes into account organizationa l hierarchy and management levels. This leads to a clear bias towards recommending users from the same division. As shown in figure 4, both Friend-of-Friend and SONAR have the effect of increasing the modularity of the network based on division, thus strengthening connections within the di-vision. We can also see that users show a higher proba-bility of accepting recommended users that have a similar division. Meaning the recommendations have strengthened the connections within the company divisions. The content based algorithms have reduced modularity, meaning it has improved connections between divisions.

Table 3 shows the activity levels of the resulting connec-tions. As can be seen in the 12 months following the ex-periment, all algorithms show a low uptake in maintaining these relationships. However the algorithm that shows the least percentage of throw away links is the Content Match-ing algorithm with %18. SONAR however results in the most active links with an average of 3 events per active link, the Content Matching algorithm results in the second most active links. Interestingly, Friend-of-Friend shows the lo w-est level of activity events per link. The directionality of th e activity is also shown and Friend-of-Friend shows the least Figure 4: The delta in Modularity of the Network Clustering activity from the recommended user, suggesting the already popular users may be less interested in maintaining these new connections. The other three algorithms show %50 of the recommended users interacted with the new connection. The Content-plus-Link algorithm shows a surprisingly low level of activity from the participating users. This suggest s the users accepted the connections, but did not have signif-icant interest in the users they connected to.
This paper has explored the network effects of four differ-ent recommendation algorithms and their implications for the social network. We argue that recommendation algo-rithms in social networks should not be evaluated on user acceptance rate alone. A recommendation algorithm that identifies all users in a user X  X  immediate social graph may have a high acceptance rate but may suppress showing con-tacts that might be interesting, relevant and valuable, but are too far away in the social graph. The choice of recom-mendation algorithm has an impact on the delicate balance of small world social networks.
 If the aim is to promote popularity, then the choice of Friend-of-Friend algorithm may be satisfactory, although in the long-term, this algorithm leads to the  X  X ich getting ric her X  and thus may decrease the value of the network. If the goal is to promote long range links that connect otherwise discon-nected communities, the Content Matching algorithm could be used. While this algorithm leads to an increase in be-tweenness centrality and to an increase in long-term user activity, it has the lowest acceptance rates since it recom-mends mostly unknown users [2]. One possible solution to improve user acceptance of recommendations is to highlight , with every recommendation, how it will affect a users reach and access to new communities and people important for their job. Future work should evaluate how a user X  X  aware-ness of the network effects impacts acceptance rates com-pared to showing only content matching evidence.
If the optimal and desired network structure is arguable and unless the aim is clear, then a possible solution is to use a variety of different algorithms. This argument supports the findings by McDonald stating that  X  users naturally want the system to augment and assist, not replace their natural behavior  X  [9]. As a result, the recommender system could aim to provide relevant and useful options to allow users to make natural selections rather than being overly influenced by a single network view. [1] R. S.
