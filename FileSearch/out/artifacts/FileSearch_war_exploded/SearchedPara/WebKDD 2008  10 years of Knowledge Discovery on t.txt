 WebKDD was held in c onjunction with the 14 SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2008), August 24, 2008, in Henderson/Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2008, WebKDD was held for the tenth time. We report on the contents and outcomes of this anniversary workshop and include a small retrospection on 10 years of knowledge discovery on the Web. Web mining, Web analytics, personalization, recommender systems, query-log mining, communities, attack detection, spam detection WebKDD 2008 was the tenth of a succesful series of workshops. Launched in 1999 by Brij Masand and Myra Spiliopoulou, the first workshop of the series WebKDD 1999 invited contributions on  X  X eb usage mining X . In the 10 years that followed, the scope of WebKDD was broadened to cover the emerging KDD topics on the Web: Mining Web usage and content, extracting semantic s, analyzing Web query logs and supporting Web search, addressing the challenges of personalization and recommender systems, protecting user privacy and fending o ff attacks and spam. For the past nine years, We bKDD workshops have fostered new ideas and research contributions on the hot topics of Web mining. Many workshops have concentrated on one subject area: For exampl e, WebKDD 2000 and WebKDD 2001 focused on e-commerce, WebKDD 2005 stressed the aspect of evolution in Web clickstreams, while WebKDD 2007 was on mining the Social Web and was organized jointly with the SNAKDD 2007 on social network analysis. The 10 th WebKDD workshop invited contributions on all areas of Web mining and furthe r promoted discussions on  X  X essons learned X  and open issues for the years to follow. WebKDD 2008 also featured a best-paper-award, sponsored by Yahoo! Research. WebKDD 2008 called for retrospection and reflection upon the achievements and the open i ssues of Web Mining. Some of these achievements are mirrored in the impact of the workshop series itself: In February 2008, when the proposal for the 10 th WebKDD workshop was submitted for evaluation, the papers at the past WebKDD workshops had accumulated about 940 citations, including 7 patent citations that cite the workshop as the premier reference on the topic of Web usage analysis. One day before the workshop opening, on August 22, 2008, the WebKDD 2000 paper  X  X pplication of Dimensionality Reduction in Recommender System -A Case Study X  [10] counted 299 citations, while an earlier WebKDD 1999 publication,  X  X ata Mining of Us er Navigation Patterns X  [11], was cited 228 times. Although ear lier papers have an advantage over more recent ones, and generic contributions tend to be more broadly c ited than specialized ones, contributions of more recent year s have also seen their share: Among these, the rather spec ialized work on  X  X sing Rank Propagation and Probabilistic Counting for Link-Based Spam Detection X  [12] from WebK DD 2006 was cited 26 times and was one of 25 papers with more than 20 citations. To bring the recent advances in all those cited areas together, WebKDD 2008 invited contributions on all aspects of user activities in the Web: (1) Mining server log (clickstream) data, (2) mining query log data , (3) mining user activities in social venues and (4) mining user activities in venues that foster the capturing of data semantics, e.g. for building the Semantic Web or for building folksonomies. To promote reflection on lessons learned and on open issues, WebKDD 2008 included time for discussions at the end of each session, as well as a closing discussion after all papers have been presented. WebKDD 2008 received 24 s ubmissions. Each paper was peer-reviewed by three members of the Program Committee and 9 papers were accepted for presentation. Among them, one paper was selected for the be st paper award, as described below. An extended version of the accepted papers will appear in an LNCS volume in the series  X  X dvances in Web Mining and Web Usage Analys is X  that has accommodated the extended WebKDD papers since 2005. The materials of the workshop, including the program and http://webmining.spd.louisv ille.edu/webkdd08/ program.html . The accepted papers were organized into four sessions. To allow for a deeper content discussion, the sessions were further grouped across the two themes,  X  X ocial and Web Graph Mining X  and  X  X eb Pe rsonalization and User Profiling X . The intensity of the discussions was remarkable: During and after the talks there were well-informed questions and comments from the approximately thirty participants. The first paper,  X  Detecting Commmunities via Simultaneous Clustering of Graphs and Folksonomies  X  by Akshay Java, Anupam Joshi, and Tim Finin [1], present a simple technique for detecting communities by utilizing both the link structure and folksonomy (or tag) information that is readily available in most social media systems. A simple way to describe their approach is by defining a community as a set of nodes in a graph that link more frequently to within this set than outside it and they share similar tags. The proposed technique is based on the Normalized Cut (NCut) algorithm and can be easily and efficien tly implemented. Their method, Simultaneous Cut (SimCut), has the advantage that it can group related tags and clus ter the nodes simultaneously. The second paper,  X  I/O efficient computation of First Order Markov Measures for Large and Evolving Graphs  X  by Prasanna K Desikan and Jaideep Srivastava [2], addresses the challenges of computing Firs t-order Markov measures, considering PageRank as the example of such a measure. They address two challenging computational scenarios for PageRank: (a) computation for a large single graph at a given time instance and (b) incremental computation for large evolving graphs. They achieve efficiency by reducing the problem size and reducing the number of iterations to compute. For (a), they bin the nodes in different partitions and for the subgraph formed by each of these partitions they use the nature of the first-order Markov model to break down the problem of computation. Fo r (b), they propose a method to accommodate the changed edges and nodes into new partitions and existing partitio ns and identify the subset of partitions for which re-comput ation is necessary. For each identified partition, they use an incremental approach to compute the measure in a scalable manner. The third paper,  X  An Empirical Study of Dynamic Pari-mutuel Markets: Evidence from the Tech Buzz Game  X  by Yiling Chen, David Pennock, and Tejaswi Kasturi [3], examines empirical questions related to DPMs. A dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM) is a hybrid between a continuous double auction (CDA) and a pa ri-mutuel market. Like a CDA, a DPM incentivizes traders to reveal their information early. Like a pari-mutuel ma rket, a DPM has infinite liquidity, allowing trades at any time. The paper examines the following two questions: Do prices in DPMs predict events of interests? How do traders behave in DPMs? Leveraging a data set from the Yahoo!/O'Reilly Tech Buzz Game, a live system using the DPM, the authors show that prices offer informative forecast s of future event trends. At the agent level, they find that on average human traders outperform robot traders who randomly place trades. Those human traders who are seemi ngly more rational, buying when the implied market probability is low and selling when it is high, obtain higher profit on average than those who appear less rational. They also examine other aspects of the game, including incentives to manipulate the market. The fourth paper,  X  Query-log mining for detecting polysemy and spam  X  by Carlos Castillo, Claudio Corsi, Debora Donato, Paolo Ferragina, and Ar istides Gionis [4], exploits user feedback and query-log mining to combat spam and identify query polysemy. The paper studies the interaction of users with search engines, which provides implicit feedback that can be used to extract useful knowledge and improve the quality of the search process. This feedback is encoded in the form of a query log that cons ists of a sequence of search actions, which contain information about submitted queries, documents viewed, and documents clicked by the users. In this paper, the authors propose characterizing documents and queries via the information availa ble within a query log, with the goal of detecting either query polysemy or spam-hosts and spam-queries, i.e., querie s that exhibit the undesirable property of showing a higher rate of spam pages in their list of results than other queries. The last paper,  X  Exploring the Impact of Profile Injection Attacks in Social Tagging Systems  X  by Maryam Ramezani, J.J. Sandvig, Runa Bhaumik, Robin Burke, and Bamshad Mobasher [5], addresses the problem of vulnerability of social tagging systems to sp amming and profile injection attacks as in the case of all open and adaptive systems that rely on user input to organize and present content. Malicious users may try to distort the system X  X  behavior by inserting erroneous or misleading annotati ons, thus altering the way in which information is presented to legitimate users. In this paper, the authors present and study two types of potential attacks against tagging systems. Using real data from a popular social tagging Web site, they empirically evaluate the impact of these attacks and their variants. Specifically, they consider two variants of an attack (called the overload attack) designed to promote a resource by adding different types of annotations to that resource, and another type of attack (called a piggyback at tack) designed to promote a resource by associating it with other resources. Their results show that current systems are vulnerable to attacks especially in scenarios where the attacker focuses on a specific target group of users to promote a target resource. The first paper,  X  Detecting concept drift in web usage mining  X  by Jose Borges and Mark Levene [6], studies the problem of detecting concept drift and assessing how much log data should be used to bui ld a prediction model in the context of web usage mining, when predicting the user X  X  next web page access. To tackle this problem they use a variable length Markov chain to represent a collection of users' web navigation sessions and to provi de the choice of predictions for unseen sessions. The window size used to train the Markov chain model is a parameter that determines the amount of log data that is us ed to build the model. To evaluate the prediction accuracy they use the mean absolute error and the hit and miss scores. Intuitively, if the prediction accuracy gets better when training on a window of a particular size, rather than on the whole navigation history, then they have detected concept drift. Extensive experimental evaluation on real data sets support the conclusion that a change in users' navigation behavi or, i.e. concept drift, can be detected with the aid of the scoring metrics used to evaluate precision accuracy. The second paper, winner of th e Yahoo! Research Best Paper Award,  X  Learning Preferences of New Users in Recommender Systems: An Information Theoretic Approach  X  by Al M. Rashid, George Karypis, and John Riedl [7], addresses the challenge that a new user poses to Collaborative Filtering recommenders. Since the system has no knowledge about the preferences of the new user, it cannot provide personalized recommendations. A new user preference elicitation strategy needs to ensure that the user does not abandon a lengthy signup process, nor lose interest in returning to the site due to the low quality of initial recommendations. To solve this problem, they develop a set of information theoretic strate gies for the new user problem. They propose an offline simulation framework, and evaluate the strategies through extensive offline simulations and an online experiment with real users of a live recommender system. The third paper,  X  Justified Recommendations based on Content and Rating Data  X  by Panagiotis Symeonidis, Alex Nanopoulos, and Yannis Manolopoul os [8], addresses the limitations of existing recomme ndation justification systems which are based solely on navigational information, by proposing a novel approach that attains simultaneously accurate and justifiable recommendations. They construct a feature profile for the users, to reveal their favorite features. Moreover, they create biclusters (i.e. group of users which exhibit highly correlated ratings on groups of items) to exploit partial matching between the preferences of the test user and each community of users. They evaluate the quality of their justifications with an objective metric in a real data set, showing the superiority of the proposed approach. They also conduct a user study to compare users' satisfaction using the existing versus the proposed justification style. The study showed that the proposed justif ication style is the users' favorite choice. The fourth paper,  X  Personalized Web Search by Using Learned User Profiles in Re-ranking  X  by Jia Hu and Philip K Chan [9], addresses the challenge of distinguishing the different contexts of the same query due to individual users having different interests. To im prove the relevance of search results, they propose re-ranking results based on a learned user profile and extending their previous work which introduced a scoring function for re-ranking search results based on a learned User Interest Hierarchy (UIH), and where the results indicated that they could improve relevance at lower ranks, but not at the top 5 ranks. In this paper, they improve the scoring function by incorporating new term characteristics, image characteristics, and pivoted length normalization. WebKDD 2008 featured a best paper award, made possible with the kind support of Yahoo! Research. The paper was chosen by the workshop orga nizers among those that have been unanimously considered a cceptable by all reviewers and received the best scores and comments. The Best Paper Award went to  X  X earning Preferences of New Users in Recommender Systems: An Information Theoretic Approach X  by Al M. Rashid, George Karypis, and John Riedl. The paper focuses on recommender systems, one of the oldest and most successful application domains of Web usage mining. The authors take a new perspective (that of information theory) in dealing with the cold-start problem, i.e. the problem of delivering proper recommendations to users for which very little is known. This is a known and challenging problem, to which mu ch effort has been devoted, yet, even in the 10 th year of WebKDD there were not many satisfactory solutions to it. The best paper award, consisted of a winner certificate from by Yahoo! Research and $500, and it was presented to the winners by Yahoo researcher, Aristidis Gionis. A prominent issue brought forward in the closing discussion of WebKDD 2008 was the need for datasets that are made publicly available and are appropriate for analysis, evaluation and comparisons. The need for public datasets has become increasingly pressing in the last years, and more so since many conferences in the area (including KDD) expect that the evaluation of methods can be done in a transparent and reproducible way. This need is even more acute in WebKDD research, because of the complexity of Web server logs and application logs, the absenc e of a straightforward ground truth in the data and the sophisticated nature of Web applications (includi ng applications in the Social Web). It was also suggested to define competitions around published datasets, since this brings forward new ideas and new solutions. It was stressed that knowledg e discovery on the Web has become mainstream, and that sophisticated applications are proliferating, giving rise to complex new challenges, many of which are interdisciplinary in nature. In fact,  X  X eb science X  as a new concept and as a conference series is an indication of the need for bringing together researchers that study the Web from different perspectives. The interaction with scholars from other disciplines is therefore seen as a necessity and as an opportunity: Interaction and understanding of the methodologie s and solutions offered in each discipline is the basis for new ideas and innovative solutions. The discussions concluded that WebKDD should sharpen its focus on modeling user behavior on the Web. As everyone noted, Web Mining in general had become a fairly mainstream topic. However, there is room within this area for a workshop to focus specifically on the modeling and the analysis of increasingly more complex Web environment and data sets. This makes the need for more sophisticated approaches for modeling or pr edicting user behavior even more pronounced. Indeed, this being the original focus of WebKDD, to some extent this would be a return to the roots, but in a much more complex WWW. We also discussed creating and maintaining a single Web site associated with WebKDD on which, among other things, people can post an up-to-date, detailed, and annotated list of current research problems. In th e long run, not only this will benefit the WebKDD research community, but good solutions to some of these problems can be the basis of a format for future workshops (or even a contest). The WebKDD workshop series has accompanied the new area of knowledge discovery on the Web from its early time to the present day. Mining the Web has now become mainstream, many of the early problems have been solved but many still remain open. In telligent applications that exploit content, social applica tions that interconnect people and foster exchange, cooperation and flow of influence, high expectations in the retrieval of answers  X  rather than content, all these applications ha ve emerged and brought new challenges to WebKDD. One of them is in protecting the Web and its users from malice  X  malicious content, malevolent services and their creators. A further one is privacy: The Social Web has become a great venue for interaction among people; people jo in it to share with others  X  via information, experiences, ideas, and feelings. As part of what was formerly private is now shared among friends, the notion of private  X  X phere X  needs redefinition, but privacy protection will remain as indispensable as before. An enumeration of grand challenges is beyond the scope of this report. As people join the Web and invent more and more applications in it, challenges emerge quite naturally. Interdisciplinary efforts ar e a key to understanding these challenges and a key to solving them. WebKDD has contributed to understanding and analyzing the Web for 10 years. We hope that the series will keep inspiring scholars and, most importantly, that the scholars who constitute the Web Mining Community will sustain it and continue contributing to understanding the Web and learning from it.

 In the last 10 years, the WebKDD workshops were organized by several people, not all of whom were involved this year. Yet, they have shaped WebKDD to no less extent, and we are grateful to them for the hard and dedicated work that made 10 years of WebKDD possible, these include: Brij Masand who has been the first WebKDD workshop co-organizer, and had the idea of a workshop on Web usage mining at KDD. He deserves the gratefulness of all other organizers. We also acknowledge the rest of the past organizers: Ronny Kohavi, Bing Liu, and Philip S. Yu. We are indebted to the Workshop Chairs of the KDD conferences since 1999 for entrusting us with the organization of We bKDD, providing advice and active coordination support from the first announcement to the concerted action of preparing the workshop notes for local distribution. Springer-Verlag has been our reliable publisher for most of the workshops, entrusting us a volume in the prestigious LNCS series ever since the first, still unknown WebKDD workshop in 1999; and later, when WebKDD has reached maturity and regularity, launching the  X  X dvances in Web Mining and Web Usage Analysis X  subseries to accommodate th e extended versions of the papers. But most of all we are deeply indebted to the Web Mining Community, who has accompan ied WebKDD for these 10 years, who has contributed with their submissions, reviews, ideas, comments and trust and made the first 10 years of knowledge discovery on the Web possible.
