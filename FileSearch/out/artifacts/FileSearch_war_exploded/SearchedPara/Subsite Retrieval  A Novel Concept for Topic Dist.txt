 While the Web grows exponentially along with time, the amount of information that the users can digest remains roughly constant. With such background, search engines came out as the widely-recognized tools in helping users to retrieve information. common and important forms. User surveys have shown that about 39% [4] web search queries belong to topic distillation, while query log analysis has given an even higher proportion of 48% [4]. Because of the popularity of topic distillation, the TREC conference has included it in the Web track since the year of 1999. the basic searching unit. It has been a common strategy in the literature to use TF-IDF [2] of the query term in the page content to compute a relevance score (such as BM2500 [16]) and use hyperlinks to get an importance score (such as PageRank 2)14 and HITS [13]), then combine them to rank the retrieved web pages. However, this strategy has not successfully served the queries for topic distillation. According to the report of TREC 2003 [8], the best result based on such approaches only has marginal retrieval accuracy: precision at 10 (P@10) of 12.8% and mean average prevision (MAP) of 15.43%. That is, there is still a long way to go if one wants to get a satisfac-tory search result for topic distillation. 
As indicated by the ground truth provided by the TREC committee, the labeled an-the query topic. That is, for topic distillation, whether a page is an appropriate answer to a query is not only determined by itself, but also by all the other pages for which it improve the retrieval performance. 
The organizational structure of the website is usually represented by a tree, and the parent-child relationship can be easily got between any two pages through site map construction [5]. Through the entry point, we can access many descendant pages, which are usually quite relevant to the query. In many cases, some descendant pages are even more relevant than the labeled page in terms of TF-IDF [2]. It is just because the labeled page is usually a navigation center with only a few words while concrete contents are placed in its descendant pages. This truth leads to the major difficulty in BM2500 model [16] for the fourth query  X  X ireless communication X  of the topic dis-tillation task in TREC 2003 Web track. 
As we can see, the relevance score of the labeled page (which document ID is G07-78-3824915, and labeled in bold) is much smaller than its child pages G35-97-1056561, G36-35-1278614 and G35-01-1537522. If using single page based feature tural information of the site. This is just the motivation of our paper. 
A subsite is a sub tree of the website, which contains an entry page and all the de-scendent pages of it. We denote such a subsite rooted by p as S ( p ). With such a defini-tion, it is easy to understand that each page in the Web could correspond to a subsite. l ( p p , p 5 , ... p 13 }. 
Based on the above definition of subsite, we further propose a novel search strat-words, a page can get the support from its child pages and thus may get a higher rank than before. In the experiments on both TREC 2003 and 2004, the subsite retrieval gives out a much better performance on topic distillation. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly introduce the expansion model to describe website growth process, and the PI algorithm for subsite feature extraction is proposed based on this expansion model. We conduct a set of we give the concluding remarks and future research directions in Section 5. finding the key entry pages of some related websites. Here key entry pages must obey the following rules: (i) They should be principally devoted to the topic. (ii) They should not be part of larger sites which are also principally devoted to the same topic. 
For example, for the topic of  X  X cience X , the following pages might be considered as key entry points in .gov domain: http://www.nsf.gov/ (National Science Fondation) http://science.nasa.gov/ (NASA Science) http://www.science.gov/ (Government Science Portal) http://www.house.gov/science/welcome.htm (House Committee on Science) 
However, the page http://www.house.gov/ will not be regard as key entry point be-passing the second rule. 
In addition, key entry pages often provide many access points to their child pages pages. In other words, a key entry page is also a good starting point for users to navi-gate the corresponding (sub) site because it contains rich organizational structure information. working quite well for other search tasks. In this regard, we will propose a novel con-review on how previous works utilize the structure information of the Web. 
There are many works which try to use web structure to assist topic distillation, such as [1,3,4,6,7,18]. Here we will intr oduce the relevance propagation model [18] in details, because the motivation of [18] is similar to our idea. 
Shakery, et al [18] considers how to use Web structure to further improve rele-vance weighting. They propagate the relevance score of a page to another page through hyperlink between them. They define the so-called hyper relevance score of relevance), a weighted sum of the hyper relevance scores of all the pages that point to it, and a weighted sum of the hyper relevance scores of all the pages it points to. Ac-cording to these definitions, their relevance propagation model can be written as: and out-link pages. For implementation, they give three special case of the relevance propagation model: weighted in-link case, weighted out-link case, and uniform out-link case 1 . 
Their experimental results show that relevance propagation generally performs bet-ter than using only content information. However, the amount of improvement is sensitive to the document collection and the tuning of parameters [18]. In this paper, we make use the subsite structure to boost the topic distillation in the Web. The subsite structure becomes the key component of the retrieval framework. In this section, we will exhibit the details of subsite retrieval. As referred in the intro-performance for topic distillation. Different from the traditional texts, the information pression structure to help users well catch and understand what he wants to show. By exploring the expression structure of the website, we find the topics usually organized in a hierarchical structure so that it is very natural to use the subsite as basic searching unit for topic distillation. 
Specifically, we propose a generative model to simulate the growing process of discuss how to recover that original idea based on an existing website reversely. Ac-retrieval 3.1 Expansion Model either not restricted. People can add almost anything into their website and organize it processes of all the websites rigorously. Here, we give a very representative and sim-ple model to describe the general growing process of websites in statistical sense. We call it expansion model, illustrated as follows. about what this website should talk about. According to this idea, he can first build a homepage with some related materials. See in Figure 2(a), the homepage is denoted by a circle. Obviously, the author will not be satisfied with only one page in his web-2(a). The author determines that three of them should be expatiated in new pages respectively. Then, he will collect materials and resources to realize three new pages to illustrate each part, seen in Figure 2(b). The region with horizontal bars in the child parent page. Notice that the new collected materials are not completely consistent. Meanwhile, in the homepage, the original region for each separated topics is reduced. There are only a few sentences, even a few hyperlinks, left in the homepage for each sub idea. If we extract the feature of each sub topic from the homepage at this time, we only can get a very little value on the separated three because the main words for them are scatted in the child pages although they are indeed the major part of the site. Then for the next steps, some of these sub topics will also be enriched in similar man-ners and some grandchild pages are formed, seen in Figure 2(c). The green one can be considered to include three sub topics and two of them are separated away and expand to two child pages of the green one, also the grandchild pages of the homepage. This is a divide-expand process, which recursively build a content-rich website starting from only some original ideas. Through this process, the original idea of each subsite resources are brought into the subsite to support each sub topics. We believe that the above model can describe its heart and sole although the real-world website authoring process might be much more complex. 3.2 Subsite Feature Extraction scribed in the expansion model. Actually, this time, we already have a website. What the key content. As mentioned in above subsection, a page is only part of the realiza-pages in the subsite to reconstruct the whole original idea. 
According to the expansion model, in each iterative step, a page will generate many child pages to expatiate its original idea and each child page may contain many other materials which are not completely corresponding to the parent page. If we simply accumulate the features of all pages in the subsite, these mass of materials will extremely dilute the original idea of the subsite. That is, the accumulated information will contain concept drift as compared to the original idea. To tackle this problem, we propose the Punished Integration (PI) algorithm for subsite feature extraction. It inte-grates the features of all individual pages in the subsite with the consideration of how much a page contributes to the whole subsite. 
Before the illustration of PI algorithm, we first give some notations for conven-ience. Suppose the website is organized as a tree with L levels. Each page in the site is denoted by p s , where s is a sequence of non-negative integers in which the last integer is the local index of this page and i -th integer is the local index of the ancestor of this page in i -th level. In fact, the local index is the order of the page in its siblings. Use R ( p s ) to denote the set of the first-generation child pages of p s . The element number of the feature of p s . Let us see an example in Figure 3. The homepage of the website is p
Denote the subsite with entry point p s by S ( p s ), quences of k non-negative number. If k = 0, Q ( k ) =  X . 
Furthermore, we use h ( p s ) to denote the height of S ( p s ), i.e. the growth process of website expansion model. Thus, we had better punish the fea-ishment. 1) The feature of the page will be punished with a factor  X  (  X  l), where  X  l is the level 
If a page is far from the entry point of the subsite, it will contain more post-and 1. In our experiment, it has an exponential form. where  X  is an adjustable variant. For the entry point, the punished factor always equals to one since  X  l =0. 2) The feature of a page will be further punished by the number of its sibling 
In the real website, some page may have many child pages. In this case, even with repress the magnitude of the concept drift derived from the amount of the sibling pages. In such a way, we can guarantee that the total of contributions of child pages to the subsite will not overwhelm the parent page. 
By jointly considering 1) and 2), the feature of subsite S ( p s ) can be extracted by part is the feature of the entry point, of the subsite. The second part is the sum of the features of other pages in the subsite with appropriate punishments. 3.3 Other Routines score for each subsite. Here, we just use BM2500 because it is widely used in many kinds of retrieval works and always gives fairly good performances. 
Although we use the subsite as the basic searching unit, we return not the whole other methods. To evaluate the performance of subsite retrieval, we used two criteri-ons: mean average precision (MAP) and precision at 10 (P@10) [2]. In this section, several experiments were conducted to test the effectiveness of subsite some implementation issues, then experimental results and discussions will be given. 4.1 Experiment Setup We chose the topic distillation task in TREC 2003 and TREC 2004 Web track as the benchmark. The corresponding data set used is the  X .GOV X  collection, which was crawled in the year of 2002. It contains 1,247,753 documents. 1,053,111 of them are html files, which were used in our experiments. There are totally 50 topic distillation queries in TREC 2003 and 75 queries in TREC 2004. 
As aforementioned, the main contribution of our paper is feature extraction for same relevance ranking function (BM2500 [16]) to get retrieval lists based on both subsite and single page based features. 
To be noted, for simplicity, we did not parse the web pages into title, body, anchor and so on. Instead we use the query term frequency in free text of the whole html file as the feature for each web page. The baseline (single page based retrieval with BM2500) has MAP of 0.1237 and P@10 of 0.110 on TREC 2003, and MAP of 0.1324 and P@10 of 0.1693 on TREC 2004. 
When testing subsite retrieval, we substituted the page-based features in the above formulas with the subsite based features extracted by our models. The corresponding retrieval results and the comparison with the single page based baseline will be given in the successive sub sections. 4.2 Performance of Subsite Retrieval In this sub section, we tested the performance of our subsite retrieval comparing with single page based retrieval. As a compariso n algorithm, we also implemented the three relevance propagation models in [18]. Our implementation is close to that in [18]. The difference is that they used language model for relevance weighting, but we adopted BM2500. Figure 4 shows the performance of subsite retrieval on topic distillation task of TREC 2003. 
As we can see from Figure 4, both MAP an d P@10 of subsite retrieval are always 0.1531 (the corresponding P@10 is 0.12) is achieved when  X  =0.5. This equals to 20% improvement over the baseline. Furthermore, this result has been almost as good as the best result reported by TREC 2003 participants (with MAP of 0.1543), even if subsite retrieval does not utilize any hyperlink information. 
Then, we compared our subsite retrieval model with the three relevance propaga-tion models [18] on TREC 2003. We listed the best performance (MAP and P@10) of both the sub-retrieval model and relevan ce propagation model in Figure 5. We can see that our subsite retrieval model outperforms all the three cases of relevance propaga-tion models, which shows the effectiveness of the subsite retrieval concept. Figure 6 shows the performance of subsite retrieval on topic distillation task of TREC 2004. From Figure 6, the MAP is almost always better than the baseline on TREC 2004. However, the P@10 overcomes the baseline only when  X  &lt;=0.7. Since  X  is the level decrease factor, this means that features propagated from children to par-ent should not be too large. 
We listed the best performance (MAP and P@10) for TREC 2004 of both the sub-retrieval model and relevance propagation model in Figure 7. Similar to Figure 6, our subsite retrieval model get the best performance of MAP. Although the subsite re-trieval model do not overcome all the three cases of relevance propagation model, it is better than two of the three. Again, this approves the value of subsite retrieval. In this paper, we proposed a novel concept, i.e. subsite retrieval, for topic distillation in the Web. We argued that subsite retrieval was a better and natural choice from the topic distillation because it was consistent with the growth manner of websites. Treat-ing subsite as the based searching unit, we proposed an expansion model to describe the website growth process, and based on this expansion model we proposed the PI BM2500, we could get the relevance score of the subsite. Experiments on topic distil-lation task of TREC 2003 and 2004 Web track showed that subsite retrieval greatly boosted performance as compared to the single page based retrieval. 
For our future work, there is still a large space to explore. 1) How to carefully design relevance computation algorithms for subsite retrieval?
