 Language researchers have long been aware that many words place semantic restrictions on the words with which they can co-occur in a syntactic relationship. Violations of these restrictions make the sense of a sentence odd or implausible: (1) Colourless green ideas sleep furiously. (2) The deer shot the hunter.
 Recognising whether or not a selectional restriction is satisfied can be an important trigger for metaphor-ical interpretations (Wilks, 1978) and also plays a role in the time course of human sentence process-ing (Rayner et al., 2004). A more relaxed notion of selectional preference captures the idea that certain classes of entities are more likely than others to fill a given argument slot of a predicate. In Natu-ral Language Processing, knowledge about proba-ble, less probable and wholly infelicitous predicate-argument pairs is of value for numerous applica-tions, for example semantic role labelling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Zapirain et al., 2009). The notion of selectional preference is not restricted to surface-level predicates such as verbs and mod-ifiers, but also extends to semantic frames (Erk, 2007) and inference rules (Pantel et al., 2007).
The fundamental problem that selectional prefer-ence models must address is data sparsity: in many cases insufficient corpus data is available to reliably measure the plausibility of a predicate-argument pair by counting its observed frequency. A rarely seen pair may be fundamentally implausible ( a carrot laughed ) or plausible but rarely expressed ( a manservant laughed ). 1 In general, it is benefi-cial to smooth plausibility estimates by integrating knowledge about the frequency of other, similar predicate-argument pairs. The task thus share some of the nature of language modelling; however, it is a task less amenable to approaches that require very large training corpora and one where the semantic quality of a model is of greater importance.
This paper takes up tools ( X  X opic models X ) that have been proven successful in modelling document-word co-occurrences and adapts them to the task of selectional preference learning. Ad-vantages of these models include a well-defined generative model that handles sparse data well, the ability to jointly induce semantic classes and predicate-specific distributions over those classes, and the enhanced statistical strength achieved by sharing knowledge across predicates. Section 2 surveys prior work on selectional preference mod-elling and on semantic applications of topic models. Section 3 describes the models used in our exper-iments. Section 4 provides details of the experi-mental design. Section 5 presents results for our models on the task of predicting human plausibility judgements for predicate-argument combinations; we show that performance is generally competi-tive with or superior to a number of other models, including models using Web-scale resources, espe-cially for low-frequency examples. In Section 6 we wrap up by summarising the paper X  X  conclusions and sketching directions for future research. 2.1 Selectional preference learning The representation (and latterly, learning) of selec-tional preferences for verbs and other predicates has long been considered a fundamental problem in computational semantics (Resnik, 1993). Many approaches to the problem use lexical taxonomies such as WordNet to identify the semantic classes that typically fill a particular argument slot for a predicate (Resnik, 1993; Clark and Weir, 2002; Schulte im Walde et al., 2008). In this paper, how-ever, we focus on methods that do not assume the availability of a comprehensive taxonomy but rather induce semantic classes automatically from a corpus of text. Such methods are more generally applicable, for example in domains or languages where handbuilt semantic lexicons have insufficient coverage or are non-existent.

Rooth et al. (1999) introduced a model of se-lectional preference induction that casts the prob-lem in a probabilistic latent-variable framework. In Rooth et al. X  X  model each observed predicate-argument pair is probabilistically generated from a latent variable, which is itself generated from an un-derlying distribution on variables. The use of latent variables, which correspond to coherent clusters of predicate-argument interactions, allow proba-bilities to be assigned to predicate-argument pairs which have not previously been observed by the model. The discovery of these predicate-argument clusters and the estimation of distributions on latent and observed variables are performed simultane-ously via an Expectation Maximisation procedure. The work presented in this paper is inspired by Rooth et al. X  X  latent variable approach, most di-rectly in the model described in Section 3.3. Erk (2007) and Pad  X  o et al. (2007) describe a corpus-driven smoothing model which is not probabilistic in nature but relies on similarity estimates from a  X  X emantic space X  model that identifies semantic similarity with closeness in a vector space of co-occurrences. Bergsma et al. (2008) suggest learn-ing selectional preferences in a discriminative way, by training a collection of SVM classifiers to recog-nise likely and unlikely arguments for predicates of interest.

Keller and Lapata (2003) suggest a simple al-ternative to smoothing-based approaches. They demonstrate that noisy counts from a Web search engine can yield estimates of plausibility for predicate-argument pairs that are superior to mod-els learned from a smaller parsed corpus. The as-sumption inherent in this approach is that given suf-ficient text, all plausible predicate-argument pairs will be observed with frequency roughly correlated with their degree of plausibility. While the model is undeniably straightforward and powerful, it has a number of drawbacks: it presupposes an extremely large corpus, the like of which will only be avail-able for a small number of domains and languages, and it is only suitable for relations that are iden-tifiable by searching raw text for specific lexical patterns. 2.2 Topic modelling The task of inducing coherent semantic clusters is common to many research areas. In the field of document modelling, a class of methods known as  X  X opic models X  have become a de facto stan-dard for identifying semantic structure in docu-ments. These include the Latent Dirichlet Al-location (LDA) model of Blei et al. (2003) and the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process model of Teh et al. (2006). Formally seen, these are hierarchi-cal Bayesian models which induce a set of latent variables or topics that are shared across docu-ments. The combination of a well-defined prob-abilistic model and Gibbs sampling procedure for estimation guarantee (eventual) convergence and the avoidance of degenerate solutions. As a result of intensive research in recent years, the behaviour of topic models is well-understood and computa-tionally efficient implementations have been de-veloped. The tools provided by this research are used in this paper as the building blocks of our selectional preference models.

Hierarchical Bayesian modelling has recently gained notable popularity in many core areas of natural language processing, from morphological segmentation (Goldwater et al., 2009) to opinion modelling (Lin et al., 2006). Yet so far there have been relatively few applications to traditional lex-ical semantic tasks. Boyd-Graber et al. (2007) in-tegrate a model of random walks on the WordNet graph into an LDA topic model to build an unsuper-vised word sense disambiguation system. Brody and Lapata (2009) adapt the basic LDA model for application to unsupervised word sense induction; in this context, the topics learned by the model are assumed to correspond to distinct senses of a partic-ular lemma. Zhang et al. (2009) are also concerned with inducing multiple senses for a particular term; here the goal is to identify distinct entity types in the output of a pattern-based entity set discovery system. Reisinger and Pa s  X  ca (2009) use LDA-like models to map automatically acquired attribute sets onto the WordNet hierarchy. Griffiths et al. (2007) demonstrate that topic models learned from document-word co-occurrences are good predictors of semantic association judgements by humans.
Simultaneously to this work, Ritter et al. (2010) have also investigated the use of topic models for selectional preference learning. Their goal is slightly different to ours in that they wish to model the probability of a binary predicate taking two specified arguments, i.e., P ( n 1 ,n 2 | v ) , whereas we model the joint and conditional probabilities of a predicate taking a single specified argument. The model architecture they propose, LinkLDA, falls somewhere between our LDA and DUAL-LDA models. Hence LinkLDA could be adapted to esti-mate P ( n,v | r ) as DUAL-LDA does, but a prelimi-nary investigation indicates that it does not perform well in this context. The most likely explanation is that LinkLDA generates its two arguments in-dependently, which may be suitable for distinct argument positions of a given predicate but is un-suitable when one of those  X  X rguments X  is in fact the predicate.

The models developed in this paper, though in-tended for semantic modelling, also bear some sim-ilarity to the internals of generative syntax models such as the  X  X nfinite tree X  (Finkel et al., 2007). In some ways, our models are less ambitious than comparable syntactic models as they focus on spe-cific fragments of grammatical structure rather than learning a more general representation of sentence syntax. It would be interesting to evaluate whether this restricted focus improves the quality of the learned model or whether general syntax models can also capture fine-grained knowledge about com-binatorial semantics. 3.1 Notation In the model descriptions below we assume a predi-cate vocabulary of V types, an argument vocab-ulary of N types and a relation vocabulary of R types. Each predicate type is associated with a singe relation; for example the predicate type eat:V:dobj (the direct object of the verb eat ) is treated as distinct from eat:V:subj (the subject of the verb eat ). The training corpus consists of W observations of argument-predicate pairs. Each model has at least one vocabulary of Z arbitrar-ily labelled latent variables. f zn is the number of observations where the latent variable z has been associated with the argument type n , f zv is the number of observations where z has been associ-ated with the predicate type v and f zr is the number of observations where z has been associated with the relation r . Finally, f z  X  is the total number of observations associated with z and f  X  v is the total number of observations containing the predicate v . 3.2 Latent Dirichlet Allocation As noted above, LDA was originally introduced to model sets of documents in terms of topics, or clus-ters of terms, that they share in varying proportions. For example, a research paper on bioinformatics may use some vocabulary that is shared with gen-eral computer science papers and some vocabulary that is shared with biomedical papers. The analogi-cal move from modelling document-term cooccur-rences to modelling predicate-argument cooccur-rences is intuitive: we assume that each predicate is associated with a distribution over semantic classes ( X  X opics X ) and that these classes are shared across predicates. The high-level  X  X enerative story X  for the LDA selectional preference model is as follows: (1) For each predicate v , draw a multinomial dis-(2) For each argument class z , draw a multinomial (3) To generate an argument for v , draw an ar-The resulting model can be written as:
P ( n | v,r ) = X Due to multinomial-Dirichlet conjugacy, the dis-tributions  X  v and  X  z can be integrated out and do not appear explicitly in the above formula. The first term in (2) can be seen as a smoothed esti-mate of the probability that class z produces the argument n ; the second is a smoothed estimate of the probability that predicate v takes an argument belonging to class z . One important point is that the smoothing effects of the Dirichlet priors on  X  v and  X  z are greatest for predicates and arguments that are rarely seen, reflecting an intuitive lack of certainty. We assume an asymmetric Dirichlet prior on  X  v (the  X  parameters can differ for each class) and a symmetric prior on  X  z (all  X  parameters are equal); this follows the recommendations of Wal-lach et al. (2009) for LDA. This model estimates predicate-argument probabilities conditional on a given predicate v ; it cannot by itself provide joint probabilities P ( n,v | r ) , which are needed for our plausibility evaluation.

Given a dataset of predicate-argument combina-tions and values for the hyperparameters  X  and  X  , the probability model is determined by the class assignment counts f zn and f zv . Following Grif-fiths and Steyvers (2004), we estimate the model by Gibbs sampling. This involves resampling the topic assignment for each observation in turn using probabilities estimated from all other observations. One efficiency bottleneck in the basic sampler de-scribed by Griffiths and Steyvers is that the entire set of topics must be iterated over for each observa-tion. Yao et al. (2009) propose a reformulation that removes this bottleneck by separating the probabil-ity mass p ( z | n,v ) into a number of buckets, some of which only require iterating over the topics cur-rently assigned to instances of type n , typically far fewer than the total number of topics. It is possible to apply similar reformulations to the models pre-sented in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 below; depending on the model and parameterisation this can reduce the running time dramatically.

Unlike some topic models such as HDP (Teh et al., 2006), LDA is parametric : the number of top-ics Z must be set by the user in advance. However, Wallach et al. (2009) demonstrate that LDA is rela-tively insensitive to larger-than-necessary choices of Z when the Dirichlet parameters  X  are optimised as part of model estimation. In our implementation we use the optimisation routines provided as part of the Mallet library, which use an iterative proce-dure to compute a maximum likelihood estimate of these hyperparameters. 2 3.3 A Rooth et al.-inspired model In Rooth et al. X  X  (1999) selectional preference model, a latent variable is responsible for generat-ing both the predicate and argument types of an ob-servation. The basic LDA model can be extended to capture this kind of predicate-argument interaction; the generative story for the resulting ROOTH-LDA model is as follows: (1) For each relation r , draw a multinomial dis-(2) For each class z , draw a multinomial  X  z over (3) To generate an observation for r , draw a class The resulting model can be written as: P ( n,v | r ) = X As suggested by the similarity between (4) and (2) , the ROOTH-LDA model can be estimated by an LDA-like Gibbs sampling procedure.

Unlike LDA, ROOTH-LDA does model the joint probability P ( n,v | r ) of a predicate and argument co-occurring. Further differences are that infor-mation about predicate-argument co-occurrence is only shared within a given interaction class rather than across the whole dataset and that the distribu-tion  X  z is not specific to the predicate v but rather to the relation r . This could potentially lead to a loss of model quality, but in practice the ability to induce  X  X ighter X  clusters seems to counteract any deterioration this causes. 3.4 A  X  X ual-topic X  model In our third model, we attempt to combine the ad-vantages of LDA and ROOTH-LDA by cluster-ing arguments and predicates according to separate class vocabularies. Each observation is generated by two latent variables rather than one, which po-tentially allows the model to learn more flexible interactions between arguments and predicates.: (1) For each relation r , draw a multinomial distri-(2) For each predicate class c , draw a multinomial (3) For each argument class z , draw a multinomial (4) To generate an observation for r , draw a predi-The resulting model can be written as: P ( n,v | r ) = X To estimate this model, we first resample the class assignments for all arguments in the data and then resample class assignments for all predicates. Other approaches are possible  X  resampling argu-ment and then predicate class assignments for each observation in turn, or sampling argument and pred-icate assignments together by blocked sampling  X  though from our experiments it does not seem that the choice of scheme makes a significant differ-ence. In the document modelling literature, probabilistic topic models are often evaluated on the likelihood they assign to unseen documents; however, it has been shown that higher log likelihood scores do not necessarily correlate with more semantically coherent induced topics (Chang et al., 2009). One popular method for evaluating selectional prefer-ence models is by testing the correlation between their predictions and human judgements of plausi-bility on a dataset of predicate-argument pairs. This can be viewed as a more semantically relevant mea-surement of model quality than likelihood-based methods, and also permits comparison with non-probabilistic models. In Section 5, we use two plausibility datasets to evaluate our models and compare to other previously published results.
We trained our models on the 90-million word written component of the British National Corpus (Burnard, 1995), parsed with the RASP toolkit (Briscoe et al., 2006). Predicates occurring with just one argument type were removed, as were all tokens containing non-alphabetic characters; no other filtering was done. The resulting datasets con-sisted of 3,587,172 verb-object observations with 7,954 predicate types and 80,107 argument types, 3,732,470 noun-noun observations with 68,303 predicate types and 105,425 argument types, and 3,843,346 adjective-noun observations with 29,975 predicate types and 62,595 argument types.

During development we used the verb-noun plau-sibility dataset from Pad  X  o et al. (2007) to direct the design of the system. Unless stated other-wise, all results are based on runs of 1,000 iter-ations with 100 classes, with a 200-iteration burnin period after which hyperparameters were reesti-mated every 50 iterations. 3 The probabilities es-timated by the models ( P ( n | v,r ) for LDA and P ( n,v | r ) for ROOTH-and DUAL-LDA) were sampled every 50 iterations post-burnin and av-eraged over three runs to smooth out variance. To compare plausibility scores for different pred-icates, we require the joint probability P ( n,v | r ) ; as LDA does not provide this, we approximate P LDA ( n,v | r ) = P BNC ( v | r ) P LDA ( n | v,r ) , where P
BNC ( v | r ) is proportional to the frequency with which predicate v is observed as an instance of relation r in the BNC.

For comparison, we reimplemented the methods of Rooth et al. (1999) and Pad  X  o et al. (2007). As mentioned above, Rooth et al. use a latent-variable model similar to (4) but without priors, trained via EM. Our implementation (henceforth ROOTH-EM) chooses the number of classes from the range (20 , 25 ,..., 50) through 5-fold cross-validation on a held-out log-likelihood measure. Settings outside this range did not give good results. Again, we run for 1,000 iterations and average predictions over three runs. Pad  X  o et al. (2007), a refinement of Erk (2007), is a non-probabilistic method that smooths predicate-argument counts with counts for other ob-served arguments of the same predicate, weighted by the similarity between arguments. Following their description, we use a 2,000-dimensional space of syntactic co-occurrence features appropriate to the relation being predicted, weight features with the G 2 transformation and compute similarity with the cosine measure. 5.1 Induced semantic classes Table 1 shows sample semantic classes induced by models trained on the corpus of BNC verb-object co-occurrences. LDA clusters nouns only, while ROOTH-LDA and ROOTH-EM learn classes that generate both nouns and verbs and DUAL-LDA clusters nouns and verbs separately. The LDA clus-ters are generally sensible: class 0 is exemplified by agreement and contract and class 1 by informa-tion and datum . There are some unintuitive blips, for example country appears between knowledge and understanding in class 2. The ROOTH-LDA classes also feel right: class 0 deals with nouns such as force , team and army which one might join , arm or lead and class 1 corresponds to  X  X hings that can be opened or closed X  such as a door , an eye or a mouth (though the model also makes the question-able prediction that all these items can plausibly be locked or slammed). The DUAL-LDA classes are notably less coherent, especially when it comes to clustering verbs: DUAL-LDA X  X  class 0V, like ROOTH-LDA X  X  class 0, has verbs that take groups as objects but its class 1V mixes sensible confla-tions ( turn , round ) with very common verbs such as see and have and the unrelated break . The general impression given by inspection of the DUAL-LDA model is that it has problems with mixing and does not manage to learn a good model; we have tried a number of solutions (e.g., blocked sampling of argument and predicate classes), without overcom-ing this brittleness. Unsurprisingly, ROOTH-EM X  X  classes have a similar feel to ROOTH-LDA; our general impression is that some of ROOTH-EM X  X  classes look even more coherent than the LDA-based models, presumably because it does not use priors to smooth its per-class distributions. 5.2 Comparison with Keller and Lapata Keller and Lapata (2003) collected a dataset of human plausibility judgements for three classes of grammatical relation: verb-object, noun-noun modification and adjective-noun modification. The items in this dataset were not chosen to balance plausibility and implausibility (as in prior psy-cholinguistic experiments) but according to their corpus frequency, leading to a more realistic task. 30 predicates were selected for each relation; each predicate was matched with three arguments from different co-occurrence bands in the BNC, e.g., naughty-girl (high frequency), naughty-dog (medium) and naughty-lunch (low). Each predicate was also matched with three random arguments AltaVista (KL) .641  X  .551  X  .700  X  .578  X  .650  X  .480  X  with which it does not co-occur in the BNC (e.g., naughty-regime, naughty-rival, naughty-protocol ). In this way two datasets ( Seen and Unseen ) of 90 items each were assembled for each predicate.
Table 2 presents results for a variety of predictive models  X  the Web frequencies reported by Keller and Lapata (2003) for two search engines, frequen-cies from the RASP-parsed BNC, 4 the reimple-mented methods of Rooth et al. (1999) and Pad  X  o et al. (2007), and the LDA, ROOTH-LDA and DUAL-LDA topic models. Following Keller and Lapata, we report Pearson correlation coefficients between log-transformed predicted frequencies and the gold-standard plausibility scores (which are already log-transformed). We also report Spearman rank cor-relations except where we do not have the origi-nal predictions (the Web count models), for com-pleteness and because the predictions of preference models are may not be log-normally distributed as corpus counts are. Zero values (found only in the BNC frequency predictions) were smoothed by 0.1 to facilitate the log transformation; it seems natural to take a zero prediction as a non-specific predic-tion of very low plausibility rather than a  X  X issing value X  as is done in other work (e.g., Pad  X  o et al., 2007).
 Despite their structural differences, LDA and ROOTH-LDA perform similarly -indeed, their predictions are highly correlated. ROOTH-LDA scores best overall, outperforming Pad  X  o et al. X  X  (2007) method and ROOTH-EM on every dataset and evaluation measure, and outperforming Keller and Lapata X  X  (2003) Web predictions on every Un-seen dataset. LDA also performs consistently well, surpassing ROOTH-EM and Pad  X  o et al. on all but one occasion. For frequent predicate-argument pairs (Seen datasets), Web counts are clearly better; however, the BNC counts are unambiguously supe-rior to LDA and ROOTH-LDA (whose predictions are based entirely on the generative model even for observed items) for the Seen verb-object data only. As might be suspected from the mixing problems observed with DUAL-LDA, this model does not perform as well as LDA and ROOTH-LDA, though it does hold its own against the other selectional preference methods.

To identify significant differences between mod-els, we use the statistical test for correlated corre-lation coefficients proposed by Meng et al. (1992), which is appropriate for correlations that share the same gold standard. 5 For the seen data there are few significant differences: ROOTH-LDA and LDA are significantly better ( p&lt; 0 . 01 ) than Pad  X  o et al. X  X  model for Pearson X  X  r on seen noun-noun data, and ROOTH-LDA is also significantly better ( p&lt; 0 . 01 ) using Spearman X  X   X  . For the unseen datasets, the BNC frequency predictions are unsur-prisingly significantly worse at the p&lt; 0 . 01 level than all smoothing models. LDA and ROOTH-LDA are significantly better ( p&lt; 0 . 01 ) than Pad  X  o et al. on every unseen dataset; ROOTH-EM is sig-nificantly better ( p&lt; 0 . 01 ) than Pad  X  o et al. on Unseen adjectives for both correlations. Meng et al. X  X  test does not find significant differences be-tween ROOTH-EM and the LDA models despite the latter X  X  clear advantages (a number of condi-tions do come close). This is because their pre-dictions are highly correlated, which is perhaps unsurprising given that they are structurally similar models trained on the same data. We hypothesise that the main reason for the superior numerical per-formance of the LDA models over EM is the prin-cipled smoothing provided by the use of Dirichlet priors, which has a small but discriminative effect on model predictions. Collating the significance scores, we find that ROOTH-LDA achieves the most positive outcomes, followed by LDA and then by ROOTH-EM. DUAL-LDA is found significantly better than Pad  X  o et al. X  X  model on unseen adjective-noun combinations, and significantly worse than the same model on seen adjective-noun data.
Latent variable models that use EM for infer-ence can be very sensitive to the number of latent variables chosen. For example, the performance of ROOTH-EM worsens quickly if the number of clusters is overestimated; for the Keller and Lap-ata datasets, settings above 50 classes lead to clear overfitting and a precipitous drop in Pearson cor-relation scores. On the other hand, Wallach et al. (2009) demonstrate that LDA is relatively insensi-tive to the choice of topic vocabulary size Z when the  X  and  X  hyperparameters are optimised appro-priately during estimation. Figure 1 plots the effect of Z on Spearman correlation for the LDA model. In general, Wallach et al. X  X  finding for document modelling transfers to selectional preference mod-els; within the range Z = 50 X 200 performance remains at a roughly similar level. In fact, we do not find that performance becomes significantly less robust when hyperparameter reestimation is deactiviated; correlation scores simply drop by a small amount (1 X 2 points), irrespective of the Z chosen. ROOTH-LDA (not graphed) seems slightly more sensitive to Z ; this may be because the  X  pa-rameters in this model operate on the relation level rather than the document level and thus fewer  X  X b-servations X  of class distributions are available when reestimating them. 5.3 Comparison with Bergsma et al. (2008) As mentioned in Section 2.1, Bergsma et al. (2008) propose a discriminative approach to preference learning. As part of their evaluation, they compare their approach to a number of others, including that of Erk (2007), on a plausibility dataset col-lected by Holmes et al. (1989). This dataset con-sists of 16 verbs, each paired with one plausible object (e.g., write-letter ) and one implausible ob-ject ( write-market ). Bergsma et al. X  X  model, trained on the 3GB AQUAINT corpus, is the only model reported to achieve perfect accuracy on distinguish-ing plausible from implausible arguments. It would be interesting to do a full comparison that controls for size and type of corpus data; in the meantime, we can report that the LDA and ROOTH-LDA models trained on verb-object observations in the BNC (about 4 times smaller than AQUAINT) also achieve a perfect score on the Holmes et al. data. 6 This paper has demonstrated how Bayesian tech-niques originally developed for modelling the top-ical structure of documents can be adapted to learn probabilistic models of selectional preference. These models are especially effective for estimat-ing plausibility of low-frequency items, thus distin-guishing rarity from clear implausibility.

The models presented here derive their predic-tions by modelling predicate-argument plausibility through the intermediary of latent variables. As observed in Section 5.2 this may be a suboptimal strategy for frequent combinations, where corpus counts are probably reliable and plausibility judge-ments may be affected by lexical collocation ef-fects. One principled method for folding corpus counts into LDA-like models would be to use hi-erarchical priors, as in the n-gram topic model of Wallach (2006). Another potential direction for system improvement would be an integration of our generative model with Bergsma et al. X  X  (2008) discriminative model  X  this could be done in a num-ber of ways, including using the induced classes of a topic model as features for a discriminative classifier or using the discriminative classifier to produce additional high-quality training data from noisy unparsed text.

Comparison to plausibility judgements gives an intrinsic measure of model quality. As mentioned in the Introduction, selectional preferences have many uses in NLP applications, and it will be inter-esting to evaluate the utility of Bayesian preference models in contexts such as semantic role labelling or human sentence processing modelling. The prob-abilistic nature of topic models, coupled with an appropriate probabilistic task model, may facilitate the integration of class induction and task learning in a tight and principled way. We also anticipate that latent variable models will prove effective for learning selectional preferences of semantic predi-cates (e.g., FrameNet roles) where direct estimation from a large corpus is not a viable option. This work was supported by EPSRC grant EP/G051070/1. I am grateful to Frank Keller and Mirella Lapata for sharing their plausibility data, and to Andreas Vlachos and the anonymous ACL and CoNLL reviewers for their helpful comments.
