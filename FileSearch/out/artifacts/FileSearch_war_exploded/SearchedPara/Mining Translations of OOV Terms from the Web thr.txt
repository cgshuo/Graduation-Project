 Translating out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms is a great chal-lenge for the Cross-lingual Information Retrieval and Data-driven Machine Translation systems. Several approaches have been proposed to mine translations for OOV terms from the web, especially from pages containing mixed lan-guages. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to au-tomatically translate OOV terms on the fly through cross-lingual query expansion. The proposed approach does not require any web crawling and has achieved an inclusion rate of 95% and overall translation accuracy of 90%, outperform-ing state-of-the-art OOV translation techniques.

Out-of-vocabulary(OOV) terms cause serious problems for Cross-lingual Information Retrieval and Data-driven Ma-chine Translation systems. Given the enormous amount of information on the web, many approaches have been de-veloped to mine the translations of the OOV terms from the web. STRAND system [4] searches the web for parallel text and [3] extracts translations pairs among anchor texts pointing together to the same webpage. However they all suffered from the lack of such bilingual resources available on the web. On the other hand, great amount of bilingual information exist on the web in the form of tentative trans-lation or references, such as  X   X   X   X   X  :  X  "  X  , ]  X   X   X  : The Bridges of Madison County s  X  : .

As observed by Zhang and Vines [5], when English terms occur in Chinese web pages, and especially when they occur within brackets, they are very likely to be translations of an immediately preceding Chinese term. Cheng et al. [1] observed that if a Chinese term occurs in an English web page, its translation usually exists in the same page too. They queried Google for En-glish pages containing the Chinese OOV term and extract the translations from the returning snippets. These two ap-
When a query and its expanded English hint words are sent to Google, snippets containing the query and possibly its English translation are returned. We apply preprocess-ing on snippet text by filtering out HTML tags, punctu-ation marks and non-query source words. We extract the English translation from the processed top-N snippets, and provide confidence scores for each translation candidates. The translation extraction features include a transliteration cost, a translation cost and their frequency-distance weights [2]. The transliteration model measures the pronunciation similarity between a source phrase and a English candidate, while the translation cost indicates their semantic equiv-alence, which is calculated from a bilingual lexicon. The frequency-distance feature shows how relevant the English candidate is with regard to the source query, based on the observation that correct translation pairs co-occur more of-ten and closer within a snippet. According to the confidence scores of different models, we output the top-5 translation hypotheses for evaluation.
We collected 310 Chinese OOV terms from 12 categories, including movie titles, book titles, organization names, prod-uct brands, sci &amp; tech. terms, specie names, person names, location, military terms, medical terms, musical terms and sports terms. On average 13.2 snippets were used to identify the relevant Chinese terms f 0 for each OOV term f . Top-5 f s were used to generate hint words e 0 . Snippets contain-ing both f and e 0 were then used to extract translations for f . Figure 1 shows the inclusion rate vs. the number of snippets used for three mixed language page searching strategies. Inclusion rate is defined as the number of OOV terms which have correct translations included in the re-turning snippets. Searching web pages containing f with-out any language constraints as did in [5] resulted in a rel-atively low inclusion rate. Constraining the search to En-glish pages only [1] resulted in a much higher inclusion rate. But such English pages are limited. On average, only 45 unique snippets could be found for each f which resulted in a maximum inclusion rate of 85.8%. In the case of the cross-lingual query expansion, the search spaces was much larger and we achieved a high inclusion rate of 89.7% when using 32 snippets and 95.2% when using 165 snippets. However, more snippets also introduced more noises. Table 1 showed the translation extraction accuracy using different features. With more returned snippets, the extraction accuracy is decreased when using transliteration (Trl) and translation model (Trans) alone. However, adding frequency-distance model (Freq-Dis) boosts the accuracy significantly. Table 1: Extraction Accuracies Using Different Fea-tures
