Clustering (grouping) has emerged as one of the omnipresent paradigms of information processing with a powerful and diversified algorithmic suite. In the vigorous pursuits for discovery and description of data that today became a genuine fabric of our e-Society, a plethora of various clustering techniques blossomed rapidly. While their algorithmic diversity is truly surprising, at the same time they assume a pretty uniform position as far as the underlying methodology is concerned. Almost all of them are predominantly data-driven meaning that in the formulation of the problem, one starts with the (numeric) data, formulates a certain measure of distance or similarity, specifies an objective function (performance index) and assigns the data to clusters in a manner which guarantees minimal value for this performance index. In essence, the data is at the heart of the overall process of revealing the clustering structure.

Today  X  s data are far more heterogeneous than they used to be in the past. The development of human-centric computing (HC2) and human-centric systems is high on the research agenda. Take, for instance, the problem of building a personalized digital album. Intuitively, clustering could be an ideal vehicle to orga-nize the photos. While pretty sound, this purely data-driven solution to the problem ignores the (significant) subjective factor from the equation (given that each user is unique with his/her own personality and specific preferences). The relevance feedback provided by the user should lead to better personalization of the al-bum  X  s organization as well as more efficient retrieval mechanisms. To accommodate those crucial needs, the data-driven facet of clustering must be enriched by domain knowledge articulated by the user. The group-ing and organization of photos completed in such a framework is referred to as knowledge-based clustering. The knowledge component offered by the user (subjective dimension) could come in the form of different hints about allocation of specific objects to categories or proximity dependencies between them.
Knowledge-based clustering seamlessly combines the data and domain knowledge being offered by the designer/user into a single highly unified framework. The taxonomy of knowledge hints, design methodol-ogy of the clustering techniques, detailed algorithms and evaluation schemes contribute to the coherent par-adigm of knowledge-based clustering. This research monograph offers a refreshingly new perspective through an authoritative, prudently organized and lucidly written treatise on the principles and practice of an emerging paradigm. Professor Lotfi A. Zadeh, with his magisterial vision captures the quintessence of this book  X  a magnum opus which touches upon some of the most basic facets of human cognition. It does so with authority, originality, erudition, insight, and high expository skill  X  .

For the reader  X  s benefit, I will now go over the main topics covered in the book as this would be helpful in visualizing the main categories of algorithms while appreciating the systematic flow of the entire material.
The first three chapters offer a wealth of fundamental material thus making the book fairly self-con-tained. The first chapter covers the very fundamental ideas of clustering and fuzzy clustering and serves as a well focused introduction to the subject matter. Information granules are at the center of many pro-cesses of human cognition activities. In the formalization of information granulation and granules, fuzzy sets play an important role. The second chapter elaborates on this role and shows that fuzzy sets, fuzzy clustering, and information granules go hand in hand. It also covers the fundamentals of fuzzy sets. Chap-ter 3 discusses the unique processing framework of logic-oriented neurocomputing. In contrast to the  X  standard  X  neural networks, the ones constructed here are highly heterogeneous, being built with the use of interpretable logic neurons endowed with significant parametric flexibility much like in artificial neurons.

The next consecutive chapters tackle the principles of conditional clustering and clustering with partial supervision. In Chapter 4, clustering is focused on a subset of data with some context defined in an auxiliary space as logic filter applied to data analysis. This could be found quite useful in system modeling where the models are formed on a basis of input-output pairs of data; the clusters built in the input space are reflective of the topology of data when looking at them from the perspective of the output space. The mechanism of partial supervision presented in Chapter 5 helps navigate the search for structure when some (usually quite small) fraction of data has been labeled (hence the name of partial supervision).
 ciples of knowledge-based guidance and offers some taxonomy of the domain knowledge hints. The concept of proximity based clustering is of particular significance. Using this concept, domain knowledge becomes available through collection of a series of proximity values between the selected pairs of data. In our digital photo album example, it is quite intuitive to anticipate that the user navigates or personalizes the search by comparing some pairs of pictures and expressing their proximity (level of resemblance).
 dled within several sources of data when they communicate (collaborate) at the level of information gran-ules (partition matrices or prototypes). Directional clustering (Chapter 8) addresses the issue of data organization while looking at the directionality of the mappings between the data spaces. Next, in Chapter 9 fuzzy relational clustering is discussed.
 box models and the Tschebyschev variant of the Fuzzy C-Means as well as genetic tolerance fuzzy neural networks (in which knowledge-based clustering is augmented by the use of fuzzy neurocomputing). The two concluding chapters look into granular modeling by showing how the results of clustering can be directly applied to system modeling in the form of so called granular mappings and linguistic modeling. analysis that offers a unique, outstanding vision and at the same time a highly readable and authoritative treatment of knowledge-based clustering. Through this work Dr. Pedrycz has proven his unique mastery in combining insightful vision with fundamental science into an outstanding perspective on one of the major technologies destined to fuel tomorrow  X  s e-Society.
