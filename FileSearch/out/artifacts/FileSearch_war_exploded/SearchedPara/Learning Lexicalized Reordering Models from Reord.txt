 Phrase-based translation systems (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) prove to be the state-of-the-art as they have delivered translation perfor-mance in recent machine translation evaluations. While excelling at memorizing local translation and reordering, phrase-based systems have difficulties in modeling permutations among phrases. As a result, it is important to develop effective reordering mod-els to capture such non-local reordering.

The early phrase-based paradigm (Koehn et al., 2003) applies a simple distance-based distortion penalty to model the phrase movements. More re-cently, many researchers have presented lexicalized reordering models that take advantage of lexical information to predict reordering (Tillmann, 2004; Xiong et al., 2006; Zens and Ney, 2006; Koehn et ure 1 for illustration. In Figure 1(a), bp is in a swap order with only one bilingual phrase. In Figure 1(b), bp swaps with three bilingual phrases. Lexicalized reordering models do not distinguish different num-bers of adjacent phrase pairs, and just give bp the same count in the swap orientation.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to better estimate the reordering probabilities with the con-sideration of varying numbers of adjacent bilingual phrases. Our method uses reordering graphs to rep-resent all phrase segmentations of parallel sentence pairs, and then gets the fractional counts of bilin-gual phrases for orientations from reordering graphs in an inside-outside fashion. Experimental results indicate that our method achieves significant im-provements over the traditional lexicalized reorder-ing model (Koehn et al., 2007).

This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we first give a brief introduction to the traditional lexicalized reordering model. Then we introduce our method to estimate the reordering probabilities from reordering graphs. The experimental results are reported in Section 3. Finally, we end with a conclusion and future work in Section 4. In this section, we first describe the traditional lexi-calized reordering model, and then illustrate how to construct reordering graphs to estimate the reorder-bilingual phrases are linked according to the target-side order. Some bilingual phrases, which have no adjacent bilingual phrases because of maximum length limitation, are linked to the nearest bilingual phrases in the target-side order.

Shown in Figure 2(b), the reordering graph for the parallel sentence pair (Figure 2(a)) can be rep-resented as an undirected graph, where each rect-angle corresponds to a phrase pair, each link is the orientation relationship between adjacent bilingual phrases, and two distinguished rectangles b s and b e indicate the beginning and ending of the parallel sen-tence pair, respectively. With the reordering graph, we can obtain all reordering examples containing the given bilingual phrase. For example, the bilin-gual phrase  X  zhengshi huitan , formal meetings  X  (see Figure 2(a)), corresponding to the rectangle labeled with the source span [6,7] and the target span [4,5], is in a monotone order with one previous phrase and in a discontinuous order with two subsequent phrases (see Figure 2(b)). 2.3 Estimation of Reordering Probabilities We estimate the reordering probabilities from re-ordering graphs. Given a parallel sentence pair, there are many translation derivations correspond-ing to different paths in its reordering graph. As-suming all derivations have a uniform probability, the fractional counts of bilingual phrases for orien-tations can be calculated by utilizing an algorithm in the inside-outside fashion.

Given a phrase pair bp in the reordering graph, we denote the number of paths from b s to bp with  X  ( bp ) . It can be computed in an iterative way  X  ( bp ) = vious bilingual phrases of bp and  X  ( b s ) =1. In a sim-ilar way, the number of paths from b e to bp , notated as  X  ( bp ) , is simply  X  ( bp ) = bp 00 is one of the subsequent bilingual phrases of bp and  X  ( b e ) =1. Here, we show the  X  and  X  values of all bilingual phrases of Figure 2 in Table 1. Espe-cially, for the reordering example consisting of the bilingual phrases bp 1 =  X  jiang juxing , will hold  X  and bp 2 =  X  zhengshi huitan , formal meetings  X  , marked in the gray color in Figure 2, the  X  and  X  values can be calculated:  X  ( bp 1 ) = 1,  X  ( bp 2 ) = 1+1 = 2,  X  ( b s ) = 8+1 = 9.

Inspired by the parsing literature on pruning phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2007). The msd-fe reordering model has three features, which rep-resent the probabilities of bilingual phrases in three orientations: monotone, swap, or discontinuous. If a msd-bidirectional-fe model is used, then the number of features doubles: one for each direction. 3.1 Experiment Setup Two different sizes of training corpora are used in our experiments: one is a small-scale corpus that comes from FBIS corpus consisting of 239K bilin-gual sentence pairs, the other is a large-scale corpus that includes 1.55M bilingual sentence pairs from LDC. The 2002 NIST MT evaluation test data is used as the development set and the 2003, 2004, 2005 NIST MT test data are the test sets. We choose the MOSES 1 (Koehn et al., 2007) as the ex-perimental decoder. GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and the heuristics  X  X row-diag-final-and X  are used to generate a word-aligned corpus, where we extract bilingual phrases with maximum length 7. We use SRILM Toolkits (Stolcke, 2002) to train a 4-gram language model on the Xinhua portion of Gigaword corpus.

In exception to the reordering probabilities, we use the same features in the comparative experi-ments. During decoding, we set ttable-limit = 20, stack = 100, and perform minimum-error-rate train-ing (Och, 2003) to tune various feature weights. The translation quality is evaluated by case-insensitive BLEU-4 metric (Papineni et al., 2002). Finally, we conduct paired bootstrap sampling (Koehn, 2004) to test the significance in BLEU scores differences. 3.2 Experimental Results Table 2 shows the results of experiments with the small training corpus. For the msd-fe model, the BLEU scores by our method are 30.51 32.78 and 29.50, achieving absolute improvements of 0.89, 0.66 and 0.62 on the three test sets, respectively. For the msd-bidirectional-fe model, our method obtains BLEU scores of 30.49 32.73 and 29.24, with abso-lute improvements of 1.11, 0.73 and 0.60 over the baseline method.
