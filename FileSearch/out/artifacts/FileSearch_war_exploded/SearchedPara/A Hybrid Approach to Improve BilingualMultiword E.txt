 Bilingual multiword expression (BMWE) is an important linguistic resource. For example, when a selected word ca n be recognized as part of a multiword expression, it can give the appropriate translation for that expression. In this sense, a multiword expression refers in principle to word sequences which cannot be translated literally word-for-word. However the automatic technique studied for extracting MWEs does not necessarily follow any definition rigorously[2]. High qualified BMWEs will benefit some important tasks, such as machine translation[1,13], cross-linguistic information retrieval[8,12], and knowledge base construction[16], etc.

Many efforts have been devoted to extracting these BMWEs[4,5]. Some re-searchers detect multiwords in bilingual dictionaries because most of them are presented without being distinguished from free combinations of words[11]. Some systems rely on syntactic criteria and only extract compact bilingual multiwords[7,15]. Bilingual asymmetry information is also used in some tasks[9]. These bilingual Multiwords can typically not be aligned word-to-word, and cause a source-target and target-source asymmetry in the alignment matrix.
In this paper we apply a hybrid approach for BMWE extraction. Our system combines some techniques, including statistics, multi-sequence aligning, error-driven rules with active learning and bilingual comparison to extract MWEs from a Chinese-English bilingual corpus.
 The idea of multiple sequence alignment originates from gene comparison in the bioinformatics. Its aim is to find gene similarity. Those similar genes in DNA se-quences are the clues of family relationsh ips and evolutionary trees over different organisms or genes shared functions or properties. Although the essential of the multiple sequence alignment coincides with the edit distance which gives an in-dication of how close two strings are, this measure has been developed very well in bioinformatics. The Smith and Waterman algorithm is a classical measure for sequence alignment[18]. When the text string is viewed as common string, this algorithm is also effective. The case in point is the local sequence alignment for multiword expression extraction.
This algorithm focuses on the similarity of the local area between two se-quences while it ignores their global similarity. Its detailed information has been addressed. Their model employs dynamic programming technique by three two-dimensional matrixes and affine gap penalty to evaluate the similarity between two sequences. We design the Polyhymnia system to e xtract BMWEs. This system combines methods of frequency filtering, multi-sequence aligning, error-driven rules with active learning and bilingual comparison. In addition, the Chinese-English aligned corpus and phrase dictionary are also used. 3.1 Improvement for Multiple Sequence Alignment The goal of the multiple sequence alignment is to find the similar segments among gene sequences. This algorithm has powerful ability for pattern simi-larity computation. The essential of this algorithm is the local alignment that seeks for the common segment in local a reas. It coincides with the multiword expression extraction. The difficulty of MWE mining comes from the flexi-ble pattern, such as the multiword  X   X  may insert arbitrary words,  X   X  X nd X   X , etc.

We improve this model by introducing the POS information, and the entry score p [ i ][ j ] is computed by this way: Where the pos ( s [ i ]) denotes the POS tag of s [ i ], and pos ( t [ j ]) denotes the POS tag of t [ j ]. This equation gives different s cores on the consideration of POS tag and word in the entry.

Pairwise sequence alignment can find the similarity sequences, but it also introduces some noises wh en similar segments are only extracted from two se-quences. Multiple sequence alignment is an extension of pairwise alignment to incorporate more than two sequences into an alignment. Multiple alignment methods try to align all of the sequen ces in a specified set. Star alignment is performed among similar sequences. Given n sequences to be aligned and a threshold mw thres . One sequence q c is picked out as the  X  X enter X  sequence. For each pair ( q i ,q c ) determine an optimal alignmen t whose similar score is over mw thres , then aggregate pairwise alignments.Alignments help the identifica-tion of common regions be tween the sequences.

In addition,another improvement is the threshold for a component word of candidate multiword. Although similar t ext sequences have been clustered into some groups, some words don X  X  always occur in every sequence. To improve the robust of system, we give a threshold for these candidate component words. When the ratio of the occurrence is higher than threshold, it will be extracted out as the component word of multiword expression. 3.2 Error-Driven Rule Learning Single Rule Template. The rule template is composed of two parts, a trig-gering environment as condition part and a rewrite rule as action part. The triggering environment is the context of multiword expression. The rewrite rule includes status transformation among candidate, correct, wrong. The template is:
We consider those MWEs with less than two interior gaps. For example, a multiword expression  X  ...  X ,
We define its five parts as Prev,First,Mid,Second ,and Last . First and second parts are multiword expression itself and P rev, M idandLast parts are its context. The triggering environment should not contain all the five parts, but the First part is necessary. Every part has more than one word. These words can be discerned by its index. For example, Second part has two words. Second (  X  2) denotes  X   X  X nd Second (  X  1) denotes  X   X . The minus denote counting from right side. After these definitions, condition part has these four types, Where part denotes one of these parts: The Combination of Single Rule. The single template is the basic trig-ger. It cannot describe the complicate environment of multiword expression. We combine several single templates to for m the complex templates which have pow-erful expression ability. For example, First (  X  1 ,  X  2) = ( n, n )and Mid (  X  1) = v . In our system, these combined templates have their linguistic meaning. Every MWE has a tag to denote its status. 4.1 Resources We develop bilingual MWE extraction system called Polyhymnia. Our corpora are bilingual aligned sentences, where 100,000 pairs of bilingual sentences are used for training process and 3,000 pairs are for test set. Bilingual aligned phrases are nearly 20,000 Chinese-English pairs. These equivalents are used to extract MWE patterns. Many useful ru les learned from corpus.
 The bilingual aligned sentences are pre processed by part-of-speech tagging. Chinese POS tagging tool is developed by natural language computing lab of SJTU. English POS tagging tool is brill tagger. We also perfom the word stem-ming process for English sentences. 4.2 Results on Different Thresholds Our system involves lots of parameters. Some parameters which have little influ-ence on experimental results will be given fixed values. The parameters of pair-wise sequence alignment follow experie nced values. The crucial parameter for multiple sequence alignment is the threshold of sequence similarity mw thres .
The Fig.1 shows precision and reca ll curves on condition of different mw thres values. Some interesting results are ob served from it. The precisions between Chinese and English are similar while their recalls have a nearly 10% gap. The reason is that Chinese multiword expressions are not in evidence. For example, the boundary between word and multiword expression is not clear. Chinese part-of-speech patterns are acquired difficultly than English patterns. In addition, Chinese word partition process also i ntroduces certain error information.
It also shows that the mw thres affects both precision and recall by different degrees. With the growth of mw thres , the precision curves rise smoothly and the recall curves drop sharpl y. In the regio n of threshold mw thres from -2 to 2, the recall drops nearly 40%. Lots of candidates massively distribute in this region. When the threshold increases, many multiword expressions are thrown away. It will lead to the insufficiency of tr aining samples. The recall curves drop rapidly.

The lower precisions are also a con cern. In the regio n of threshold mw thres from -2 to 2, the precision curves improve only 10%. It origins the questioned sample quality. The samples are extracted by unsupervised approach. In one side, it saves the human labors. In the other side, it also introduces many noises. These samples also can be viewed as pseudo samples, which keep precisions on the lower levels. In addition, the number of position samples is fewer than the number of negative samples. For example, a majority of samples contain no multiword expression. The action of rules is mostly to change tags from candidate into error. The distribution difference of training samples can influence the precision. We extract BMWE from corpus by a hybrid approach. Some effective techniques are employed in this system. Every technique has its advantage. For example, the algorithm of multiple sequence alignment can extract similar patterns from corpus whatever the pattern are flexible or compact. Bilingual comparison can increase recall by its linguistic asymmetry because a multiword pattern in one language can provide additional information for its related MWE extraction in another language. In addition, the error-driven rule can introduce abundant context information. The advantage of error driven rule is that it can automated learn the linguistic knowledge. Using the combined technique, we can fully exert the large data process of statistics and direct linguistic behavior understanding by rule providing.
