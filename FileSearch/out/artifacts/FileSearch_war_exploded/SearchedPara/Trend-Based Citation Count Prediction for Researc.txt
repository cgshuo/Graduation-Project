 Nowadays, a large volume of research articles, in the order of hundreds per year if not in thousands, from diverse disciplines are continuously generated and published. When researchers kick off their research work, either during the seeking of emerging areas or after coming up with trending topics of interest, they would usually need to even be in the lead. However, due to the limitation of time, researchers might not be able to follow every paper and could be very difficult to determine which studies will possess high impact in the future. In addition, some relevant studies with different terms or keywords may be neglected due to limited human effort. Therefore, it would be useful if we can accurately measure the future impact or the influence of a paper at early stages after it gets published. As for funding agencies of government and indus-try, it is also essential to understand which projects are more potential based on either the paper publications of researchers X  project s or the possible impact of a field. Hence being able to estimate the future impact of papers can support their decision to fairly and effectively distribute the resources. 
To quantify the potential impact or influence of a particular paper, one of the most intuitive, objective, and commonly adopted measures is the number of citations, a.k.a. citation count, after the paper gets published [3]. The number of citations is the times search articles [1], and also be the most influential factor in Google Scholar X  X  ranking [6]. Nevertheless, regarding citation count to measure the impact suffers from a criti-cal issue: it works only for papers that passed a long period of time after it gets pub-lished, say going beyond five years. Most scientific articles that have only few years after getting published tend to have a lower citation count, and thus the citation count would fail to estimate its impact. To deal with this problem, in this paper, we aim to rate estimation of the long-term citation count will be beneficial for understanding the impact of a paper at early stages after it gets published (e.g., 1-3 years). Specifically, we propose to tackle three problems about citation count prediction. First, can we predict the number of citations of a paper given only its publication information, such as authors and venues? Second, can we accurately predict the citation count of a pa-are the most important factors that determine whether a paper will get a large number of citation counts? To address these problems about citation behaviors, we develop a novel Trend-based Citation Prediction (T-CCP) framework, which can effectively model and predict the long-term citation count of a given paper. Related Work. Castillo et al. [9] used the author reputation, measured by the number of disciplines. Pobiedina and Ichise [11] mined frequent graph patterns in a citation graph to estimate the future citation counts. Yan et al. [7][16], which is the most relevant work to this paper, combined content features, author features, and venues features, and used the regression models to learn the prediction function. In this work, we not only include the content-independent features categorized into publication features and early citation be-terms of space and time as the number of research articles grows rapidly and drastically. We do not consider the paper contents for the citation count prediction. Third, instead of learning the prediction function directly from all the papers, we categorize the papers into find the most proper model for the test paper to do the task of citation count prediction. 
We first analyze the behaviors of citation count over time and find that the evolu-some papers immediately burst to get lots of citation right after got published, but the citation count gradually decreased as time proceeds. On the contrary, some are inglo-articles never have bursts while others can obtain more than one bursts in their evolu-trends . Given a scientific article, we first aim to classify which citation trend it should belong to, and then to predict its citation count after  X  X  fied citation trend. In other words, the proposed Trend-based Citation Prediction consists of two stages. The first is to classify which trend the target paper will behave. The second is to predict the exact citation count after n years. Moreover, to response the abovementioned questions, we divide the features into two sets: the publication features and the early citation features. The former is to capture the knowledge about information of citation behaviors in the first k years of papers. We combine both fea-ture sets and empirically derive accurate performance. Contributions. We summarize the contributions of this paper as follows. (a) We predict the future citation counts of papers based on the content-independent (c) We devise a trend-based citation prediction (T-CCP) model to estimate the future (d) Experiments conducted on the well-known ArnetMiner citation data exhibit that 
The structure of this paper is summarized as follows. We first introduce concrete definitions as well as the problem statements in Section 2. Then in Section 3, we de-scribe the proposed method, followed by the elaboration of experimental results in Section 4. Finally we conclude this work in Section 5. Definition 1: Citation Count. For an archive of academic papers  X  X  X  , its citation count  X  X  X  X  is the number of papers that cite  X   X   X   X   X  X  X  X   X   X : X  X   X  | X  X   X  X  X  X  X  , where | X | is the number of elements in set Definition 2: Citation Sequence . A citation sequence of a paper  X   X  X  X  X  X   X   X   X   X , X  X  X   X   X ,..., X  X  X   X  X   X  X  X   X  , is a sequence of citation count riod of time  X ,...,1,2 , where  X   X  is the citation count of the published. Definition 3: Citation Trend. A citation trend  X  is a collection of citation sequences sharing a common pattern of evolution of citation count. Citation sequences of differ-ent citation trends demonstrate dissimilar evolutions of citation count. Problem 1: Citation Count Prediction. Given a scientific article to learn a predictive function  X  , and use the function counts of  X  , i.e.,  X   X  X   X  X  X  , at a particular time period 
In order to effectively solve the citation count prediction problem, we propose a trend-based citation prediction model, which consists of two stages. The first is to dicting the citation count based on the m odel trained from papers belonging to the corresponding citation trend. We think for the model training, grouping papers into instances but also to reduce the noise. Hence the prediction performance is expected to be boosted. What follows gives the problem definitions for these two stages. Problem 2: Citation Trend Classification. Given a scientific article is to accurately classify  X  into a certain citation trend Problem 3: Trend-based Citation Count Prediction. Given a scientific article  X  X  X  and the citation trend  X  it belongs to, the goal is to learn a predictive function  X  , which is trained from papers whose citation sequences belong to trend the function  X   X   X  X  X  X , X  X  to predict the citation counts of time period  X  X  after it gets published. In this section, we first introduce five categories of citation trends, which are derived based on the time of getting bursts and the number of bursts. Then we describe a se-ries of features used in this work, which can be divided into two main categories: publication features and early citation features. Finally, we present the predictive model that exploits the citation trends as well as the proposed features. 3.1 Categories of Citation Trends gate the evolution of citation count of papers over time. While existing study [15] has into identifying the patterns of citation count evolution, i.e., citation trends. The cita-paper, we observe its citation counts within future Our goal is to exploit the idea of burst to categorize the citation count evolutions into year  X  whose citation count is % X  higher than the previous year (i.e., amount of citation count. We simply divide the time of getting burst into three stages: early stage, middle stage, and late stage within the first burst number : the number of bursts of citation count of a paper. We consider three kinds of burst number: zero , single , and multiple . 
Based on burst time and burst number, we use ArnetMiner citation data to manual-late burst , (d) multi bursts , and (e) no bursts , by using the findpeaks function in Mat-lab with the setting of  X 8 X  X  and  X 75%% X  . Four of the five identified citation trends are shown in Figure 1, except for no bursts which refers to the citation trends whose average citation counts over eight years is below 1 and represents papers hav-the y -axis is the average normalized citation count (i.e., for a paper, the citation count of a particular year divided by the highest citation count within its eight years). Every paper with the early, middle, or late burst trend has a single citation burst and exhibits the highest citation counts at early, middle, or late stages respectively in their evolu-tion of its citation count. The temporal positions of such three kinds of single burst are demonstrated in Figure 1. In addition, for the category of multi bursts, we do not con-sider burst time but burst number. Papers with more than one burst fall into this cate-gory. After averaging papers belonging to this category, in Figure 1, we can find the citation count goes up gradually and becomes stable in their evolution of citations. 3.2 Publication Features The publication features can be divided into five categories: (1) author, (2) venue, (3) social, (4) expertise, and (5) reinforcement. The extraction of publication features of a target paper is performed at the year that the paper gets published. Since there might be new authors or venues that have never appeared in the past with respect to the year of publication, we use zero values for such kind of features. In addition, since a paper may contain several authors, for each of author features, we use the average and the maximum scores among authors of a paper to be the feature values. We elaborate the detailed features of each category as follows. Note that some features in the first three categories have been explored in existing work [7][16]. Author Features. (a) An author with more papers published can be considered as [7]. Therefore, we use the number of papers published to reflect the productivity of an author. (b) The h-index metric [3] has been widely used to evaluate the impact of an author. We regard the value of the h-index as one of the author features. (c) Famous authors usually ensure a certain amount of citations because their papers can perma-nently gain attention in the research communities. We measure an author X  X  reputation as a feature, which is defined by his/her average number of citations (i.e., the citation count per paper). (d) The reputation of an author can be estimated in a relative man-thors in a descending order. (e) If an author had ever co-worked with many other researchers, he/she has higher potential to be an influential scholar [1] because his/her expertise can attract the collaborations from others. We consider the number of coau-thors to estimate the collaboration capability of an author. Venue Features. (a) If a venue gets more citations, its prestige tends to be higher. We compute the average number of citations ov er the papers of a venue to capture its prestige. (b) The prestige can be also estimated relatively. Hereby we measure the years. (c) The impact of a venue might change due to the growth of a research area. We measure the recent impact of a venue based on the average citation count over the papers of such venue in recent three years. (d) Some venues target at a particular field citations for a venue. We construct a directed venue citation graph to capture the cita-tion relationships between venues, in which edge weights are the normalized citation count from one venue to the other. We use centrality measures, including (e) close-ness , (f) betweenness , (g) eigenvector , and (h) PageRank , to be the features. Social Features. Different authors have diverse extents of influence on their research communities. Some are the pioneers or the masters of a field who had ever guided, collaborated, and advised many other researchers. Some concentrate on doing inter-disciplinary studies, and play the role of mediators that connecting researchers from different fields. Some are junior researchers or passer-by individuals who might have less influence in their research communities. Therefore, we think it is critical to esti-mate the influence of an author considering the collaboration between authors. We construct a collaboration graph to represent the co-authorships between authors. In addition, we further model the effectiveness of collaboration between authors into edge weights. Two authors with more co-authored papers are considered as having a  X  X  X   X   X ,  X   X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X   X   X  X / X   X   X  X   X   X  , where  X   X  is the set of papers published by author To capture the influence of authors, based on the collaboration graph, we calculate several centrality measures, including (a) betweenness , (b) closeness , (c) eigenvector , and (d) PageRank , as the feature values. Based on the collaboration graph, we further investigate the membership of authors of a paper in terms of research communities. The collaboration between different research communities brings more audiences and leads to higher number of citations. We detect communities in the collaboration graph using Louvain X  X  algorithm [14]. Then we measure the distribution of community membership of authors using the following scores: (e) the percentage of authors be-the past), and (g) the number of communities for authors in the paper. (h) The number affects the citations of a paper [17]. We regard the number of authors of a paper as a feature.
 Expertise Features. Diverse expertise reflects different groups of audiences in either research topics or communities. An author who either has many distinct research has higher potential to attract more audiences which lead to more citations. Likewise, a venue that includes more different topics of interest can gather more attention, which results in more readers and more potential citations. We propose to measure the expertise diversity for an author, a venue, and the reference of a paper. We model the from the venue citation graph using Louvain X  X  algorithm [14]. In other words, venues belonging to the same community are consider ed to be the same expertise. We take bility that the papers of author  X  belong to expertise  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X   X   X   X  . Note that the author expertise diversity of fields had been proved to be useful [9][16] while the other five expertise diversity features are newly proposed in pers from regular, short, and poster papers. Since survey papers usually gain more citations than regular papers, we use the number of references as a feature. (f) If the area, the paper will have higher visibility and tend to have more citations. We meas-ure the tendency of a paper by calculating the average year difference between the year of its publication and the years of its references. Reinforcement Features. Important or influential authors tend to recognize repre-sentative and potential papers; hereby their papers usually cite the papers of important and renowned authors. On the other hand, influential authors also have higher poten-tial to be cited by other essential papers due to their visibility and indicativity. In other considered as a process of mutual reinforcement . We think the idea of reinforcement reinforcement for both authors and papers. We construct an author citation graph , which is a directed and weighted graph, to represent the citation relationship between authors. Specifically, if the papers of author  X   X   X  , we construct an directed edge from  X   X  to  X  defined as  X   X   X   X   X ,  X   X   X  |  X   X   X   X  |  X   X   X  X   X  X  X |/  X  author  X   X  and  X   X   X   X  |  X   X   X  is the set of  X  exploit the graph-based ranking algorithms, PageRank and HITS , to measure the cita-tion influence of authors. We denote the scores of PageRank , hub , and authority of author  X  as  X  X  X   X  X   X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  , and tal/maximum/ average score for authors of paper  X  authors of paper  X  . 3.3 Early Citation Features early stages as a paper gets published is highly correlated to its long-term citation count [2]. We directly utilize the citation sequence of the first  X   X  X  X  X  X   X   X   X   X , X  X  X   X   X ,..., X  X  X   X  X   X  X  years after getting published, we should also estimate the performance of authors of that paper. In other words, if an author is a rising star, his/her citation behavior of other pa-pers within such  X   X  years might be also promising. Let citations, which are contributed from all the papers of author  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X  and  X   X  is the year that paper  X  gets published. Let number of papers published by author  X  before time number of coauthors from all the papers of author  X  before time the following nine features to characterize the early citation behaviors of paper average increased number of papers of coauthors of Citation Structural Features. The citation behavior of papers that are cited by paper the set of papers that cite paper  X  within the first either the ecology of a certain field or the formation of multiple research fields. Papers that connect papers of different research fields or communities tend to have higher visi-community might gain more attention and citations. Therefore, we think characterizing struct the paper citation graph to represent the citation behaviors of papers. Paper connected to paper  X   X  if  X   X  has ever cited  X   X  X  X  X   X  are used to construct the paper citation graph, where  X  gets published. Based on the paper citation graph, we compute the scores of (a) PageRank , (b) clustering coefficient , (c) hub , and (d) authority of ues, denoted by  X  X  X   X  X   X  X  X  ,  X  X  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  ,  X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X  citation behaviors of papers cites  X  , we further compute the average and maximum values of these scores over the set of papers that cite (f) We consider the numbers of fields and communities over venues of papers in  X  pers in  X   X  X   X   X   X   X  . (i) The average author rank for papers in 3.4 The Prediction Models Recall that we are tackling three problems based on a certain model trained by the proposed features. The first is to directly do the citation count prediction (CCP). The second is to the citation trend classification (CTC) of papers. Based on the trends derived by CTC, the third is the trend-based citation count prediction (T-CCP). For CCP and T-CCP, we leverage the technique of Support Vector Regression (SVR) [4] to learn the prediction function. Note that Yan et al. [16] have shown that SVR is one which the features used for CTC contain the publication features and early citations of the first three years after the paper gets published. It is worthwhile to note that for T-CCP, we train a separate predictive function  X   X   X  X  X  for each of the five trends paper  X  is classified to trend  X  , we utilize the corresponding function dict the future citation count. We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method. We aim to an-swer four questions: (1) can the proposed collection of features beat the state-of-the-art method by Yan et al. [9]? (2) To what extent can the citation information provided from the early stages after a paper gets published boost the performance? (3) Can the proposed model beat the direct prediction of citation counts? (4) Which category of features has the greatest impact on the accuracy of citation count prediction? 4.1 Evaluation Settings We employ the ArnetMiner citation dataset [18], which contains major computer science publication data, for the experiments. The ArnetMiner citation data contains 1,383,158 papers, 855,629 authors, and 6,145 venues. We follow Yan et al. [7][16] to use the coefficient of determination (  X   X  ), , to be the evaluation metric,  X  the predicted citation count for paper  X  in the test set mean of the ground-truth counts for papers in  X   X  X  X  X  X  truth citation count of paper  X  .  X   X   X  X  X 0,1 X  , and a larger performance. 
For papers in a particular year  X  , we divide the papers into a training set and a testing parts, and each part is used for testing while the other parts are used for training. In addi-tion, we consider the citation count accumulated up to paper. The average  X   X  over such five results is reported. We vary so that we can see how the time period  X 12,11,10 X  X  after it gets published affects the performance. We compare the features we proposed with those utilized by Yan et al. [7][16], which has the most robust feature set to do the task of CCP. Those features used by Yan et al. is a small subset of ours, include author feature  X  {(a), (b), (c), (e)}, venue feature  X  {(c), (b), (h)}, social feature  X  {(d)}, and citation structural feature  X  {(a)}. Note their data contains the complete information of exact citation counts for every year, they are able to train the predictive model using papers before a particular year the citation counts of the future  X  X  years for papers published in regarding 80% as training and 20% as testing data. In addition, since we propose to use content-independent features, the content-related features of Yan et al. [7][16], including topic rank, topic diversity and versatility, will not be considered in our experiments. Due paper are different from those of their work. 
The evaluation consists of three parts. The first is the main experiment, which an-swers the four questions mentioned in the beginning of this section, by different com-bination of feature sets, various years, and those results under both CCP and T-CCP. The second is to report the performance of papers belonging to each citation trend over different future time periods. The third is to show the accuracy of CTC. 4.2 Experimental Results The main results are shown in Table 1. First, T-CCP averagely outperforms CCP with 0.18 improvement among different feature combinations and future time periods. Such results reflect the usefulness of citation trends: predictive functions trained from separate trend can effectively capture the future citations, avoid learning the noise instances, and thus lead to the boost of accuracy. Second, the results of early citation features are better than those of publication features with 0.34 improvement in aver-age, even using only the first or two years after getting published. This indicates that more informative or at least equal to the kno wledge provided by publication. In addi-tion, it is natural to see that as more future time periods are used (e.g. up to the performance significantly goes up, becau se more citation information is revealed. Third, as among the publication features, we can find the author feature has the most impact on the performance. We think it is due to the fact that researchers usually fol-low the research work of famous and outstanding authors, who might have high prod-and combining all the publication features can improve the performance. Fourth, combining both publication and early citation features can further boost the perfor-mance with 0.43 improvement in average, compared to features used by Yan et al. We report the performance of papers belonging to different citation trends using T-CCP with features P+EC (  X  X   X   X 3 ) under different future time periods. The results are shown in Table 2. The performance of papers possessing with at least one burst is at be accurately predicted. We think the reason is two-fold: (a) papers belonging to trends  X  X o bursts X ,  X  X iddle burst X , and  X  X ate burst X  tend to have similar few citations tinguish whether or not a paper gets bursts. 
Finally, we report the accuracy of citation trend classification (CTC) using T-CCP with features P+EC(  X  X   X   X 3 ). The confusion matrix of accuracy is shown in Table 3. We can find papers whose trends belonging to  X  X o bursts X  can be perfectly classified. Sometimes papers with the remaining four trends have higher possibility to be classi-fied to  X  X ulti-bursts X  than other three types of citation trends. We think it is because  X  X ulti-bursts X  can be considered as a combination of  X  X arly burst X ,  X  X iddle burst X , and  X  X ate burst X , and thus papers belonging to trend  X  X ulti-bursts X  might share similar features with those papers belonging to the other three trends. This paper considers citation trends to predict the future citation counts of papers Experimental results prove the effectiveness of T-CCP as well as the proposed fea-tures. In fact we can generalize the proposed model as a novel trend-based popularity predictor, and it can be exploited to predict the evolution of numbers in different types of time series data, such as the popularity of YouTube videos, the number of retweets of a post and the times of mentions of hashtag in Twitter. Nevertheless, the categories of trends might vary for different data. In the future, the mechanisms to automatically for not only citation count prediction, but also other types of time series data.
