 Advances in image acquisition and storage technology have led to tremendous growth in very large and detailed image databases [3]. A vast amount of image data is gener-ated in our daily life and each field, such as medical image, etc. These images involve a great number of useful and implicit information that is difficult for users to discover. 
Image mining can automatically discover these implicit information and patterns mining. Image mining is more than just an extension of data mining to image domain. It is an interdisciplinary endeavor that draws upon image processing, image retrieval, cations [4]. Data mining in medical images belongs to the first direction. 
A few interesting studies and successful applications involving image mining have been reported. For example, the SKICAT system [1] integrates techniques for image processing and data classification in order to identify  X  X ky objects X  captured in a sat-ellite picture set. A multimedia data mining system prototype MultiMediaMiner [2,3] rithms used in the medical images [5, 8] are generally for classification. [9] proposes medical images because there are important differences between relational databases supports them. (2) Spatial information (I ndependent versus dependent position). 
In this paper, we firstly use water immersion method to automatically detect ROIs and quantify the domain knowledge about brain image and ROIs to form the features, brain image; (2) clustering images based on the similarity of ROI. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 is pre-processing. Medical Image Clustering is presented in section 3. Section 4 briefly reports our performance study. Conclusion is presented in section 5. We used CT scan images because this modality is the most used in radiotherapy plan-ning for two main reasons. The first reason is that scanner images contain anatomical The second reason is that CT scan images are obtained using rays, which is the same rays intensity can be computed from the scanner image intensities. descriptors to form a table for mining. By applying water immersion algorithm, we segment images into objects. Let IM={IM 1 , IM 2 , ..., IM N } be a image set. After the above algorithm, Each image IM j total of objects in IM be M, then we denote the object set as R={ R 1 , R 2 , ..., R M }. 3.1 Feature Extraction The domain knowledge of the brain image characteristics indi-cates that the normal persons have nearly the same brain structure that is evident to be bilateral symmetry, see figure 2. The pathological regions result in irregularly shaped grey level distribution in the CT scan images and destroy the symmetry, see figure 1. At this point, the following relevant features are able to provide sufficient discriminative power to cluster objects into different groups: (1) grey level of the object of interest; (2) area of the object of interest; (3) location of the object of interest; (4) elongation of the object of interest; (5) direction of the object of interest; and (6) symmetry of ROI. 
With the above method, the object extracted from brain image is either brightness or darkness. So we define grey level as GL= 0 (brightness), or 1 (darkness). The sec-ond feature relate to the size of the region. Area of the region of interest is defined as the total number of pixels within the region, up to and including the boundary pixels. The location of ROI is simply defined with the coordinates of the centroid:  X  (x, y) is surface density function and k is the number of the pixels of the object. 
The fourth feature is the elongation of an object which is defined as the ratio of the width of the minor axis to the length of the major axis. This ratio is computed as the between 0 and 1. perpendicular line going through the midpoint of midline as x. With the major axis of the major axis and x positive direction and  X   X  [0, 2  X ) . Before introducing the final feature, we will give some definitions. y ) in image IM p }, P(L) and P(R) are pixel set of IM p (L) and IM p (R) respectively. For halved vertically by brain midline. They are denoted as p li and p ri .  X  these two pixels respectively. Now we define the sixth feature as following. R grey level of  X  g(P X ), mean(  X  g(P X )), satisfy the following condition: or the same one. 3.2 Object Clustering Now, we would like to determine similarity between two objects based on these fea-tween object R i and object R j is as follows: 
According to domain knowledge, we let v ij,1 be GL. Two objects are not possible to cluster. This rule is prior to the above similarity function. jects is smaller than T R , then the two objects can be in the same group. We define  X  -adjacent area (  X  -AA) as the object set in which similarity between each pair of objects in the same group must be smaller than T R . Object Clustering Algorithm (OCA): Input: object set R, T R and MP 
Output: p clusters 1. Assume that the size of object set R is M and examine  X  -AA of these M objects; 2. If (  X  -AA of Ri involves more than MP objects) 3. Then mark Ri as the core object; 4. While (all core objects) { 5. Clustering all density reachable objects; } 
Time complexity of this algorithm is O(nlogn). 3.3 Image Clustering The OCA algorithm clusters these M objects into p groups which we denoted as the weight of object cluster C p in image i. In this vector we keep the weight of each group. Thus, the size of vector W i is same as the total number of object clusters (=p). It is possible that the weight of a group ma y be zero. This is because no object of an image may be a participant of that group during clustering. the number of images in which objects of cluster C i appear. We define cosine similarity: Sim IM (IM i ,IM j ) = ) * /( ) * (
To cluster images, we also use a threshold T IM . If similarity between two images is stop when the images are clustered into k group.
 Image Clustering Algorithm (ICA): Input: Image set IM and the number of clusters k; 
Output: k clusters 2. Clustering in terms of similarity; 3. While (the number of clusters is not equal to k) { 4. If all R t s in one image are symmetrical 5. Then cluster this image to special cluster; 6. Compute Sim IM ; 7. Clustering the sub-clusters or images; } Time complexity of this algorithm for the worst case is O(n 2 ). The dataset utilized in our experiments was real data from hospital. The main reason why we study on real brain CT images instead of any simulative data is to avoid in-significance and uninterestingness and the reliability of the discovered knowledge. To vacy issues and management of hospital. But with some specialists' help and support, simplicity, we generalized to normal(N) and abnormal(A). 
To measure the quality of a cluster, we use precision and recall. Recall is the ratio of relevant images to total images for a given category. Precision is the ratio of rele-vant images to images that appear in a cluster for a given category. In figure 3, x axis other domains where large complex data sets are available. image set to detect objects in medical images. Then we proposed two new algorithms with guidance of domain knowledge to cluster the medical images. We quantified the problem with a general form to provide a common framework for other problems appeared in other domains.
