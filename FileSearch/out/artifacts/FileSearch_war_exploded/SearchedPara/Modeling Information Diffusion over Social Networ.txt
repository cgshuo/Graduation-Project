 How to model the process of information diffusion in so-cial networks is a critical research task. Although numerous attempts have been made for this study, few of them can simulate and predict the temporal dynamics of the diffusion process. To address this problem, we propose a novel in-formation diffusion model (GT model), which considers the users in network as intelligent agents. The agent jointly con-siders all his interacting neighbors and calculates the payoffs for his different choices to make strategic decision. We in-troduce the time factor into the user payoff, enabling the GT model to not only predict the behavior of a user but also to predict when he will perform the behavior. Both the global influence and social influence are explored in the time-dependent payoff calculation, where a new social influence representation method is designed to fully capture the tem-poral dynamic properties of social influence between users. Experimental results on Sina Weibo and Flickr validate the effectiveness of our methods.

Information diffusion modeling over social networks is a critical and challenging task. Diffusion models are used to explain and simulate how information diffuses in a social network. They have a wide range of applications, includ-ing information recommendation, viral marketing, breaking news detection, and so on. The current studies on informa-tion diffusion modeling can be divided into two categories: theory-centric models and data-centric models.

Theory-centric models mainly come from epidemiology, sociology and economics. The most widely-studied diffu-sion models of this category are the epidemic model,the in-dependent cascade model and the linear threshold model. These models are helpful for studying the information diffu-sion problems such as influence maximization problem [6, 4, 5]. However, they assume that the users in the network are passively influenced to spread information. Due to the lack of support from actual diffusion data, these models do not have the ability of diffusion prediction.

Data-centric models are usually learned from actual in-formation diffusion data, and can be divided into macro-models and micro-models. Macro-models [9, 11] can gen-erate diffusion cascades whose macro properties are similar to that of actual diffusion cascades. But they still can not predict the information diffusion process. This limitation is addressed by micro-models, which can predict whether a user in a social network will be activated by a piece of in-formation. Since the information diffusion process is caused by user behavior, information diffusion prediction is actu-ally user behavior prediction. Most micro-models [7, 10] can predict the behavior of a user, but they can not predict when the user will perform the behavior.

In this paper, we propose a novel information diffusion model (GT model) for temporal dynamic prediction. In contrast to traditional theory-centric models, the GT model regards the users in the network as intelligent agents. It can capture both the behavior of individual agent and the strategic interactions among these agents. By introducing the time-dependent payoffs, the GT model is able to predict the temporal dynamics of the information diffusion process. Different from most data-centric models, the GT model can not only predict whether a user will perform a behavior but also can predict when he will perform it. We make the fol-lowing contributions in this work:
A social network can be represented as G =( V, E, T ), where V is a set of | V | = N number of users; E is the set of edges: a directed/undirected edge ( u, v )  X  E represents a social tie between user u and user v ; T is a function labeling each edge with the time when the social tie was created.
Definition 1. Activation action: An activation action can be represented as a triple ( u, a, t u ), which can be inter-preted as user u was activated by information a at time t Let A u be the set of all information user u adopts over all time. We record all the activation actions of all users as the action log  X  = { ( u, a, t u ) } .

Definition 2. Information diffusion: An information a diffuses from user u to user v iff: (i) ( u, v )  X   X  We record as dif f ( a, u, v,  X  t ), where  X  t = t v  X  t u
Definition 3. Diffusion cascade: For each informa-tion a , the diffusion cascade can be defined as DC ( a )= ( V ( a ) ,E ( a )), where V ( a )= { v | X  t v :( v, a, t E ( a )= { directed edge ( v 1 ,v 2 ) | dif f ( a, v 1 ,v
Definition 4. Global influence: Given a social network, global v is used to denote the global influence of user v ,indi-cating the influence capability of v over the whole network.
Definition 5. Social influence: Given two users u , v in a social network, we use social uv ( t ) to represent the influence strength of user u on user v at time t .

Since the influence strength of user u on user v varies with time, introducing the time variable t cangivemoreaccurate description of social influence.

Based on the concepts described above, we present the following problem:
Problem 1. User payoff learning: Given a social net-work G andanactionlog X ,acriticaltaskofourworkis to learn the user X  X  time-dependent payoffs for his different choices.

In general, a user X  X  payoff contains two parts: individual payoff from his idiosyncratic preferences and social payoff from his social contacts. In this work, we mainly focus on how to learn the social payoff. We introduce the time factor into the payoff since one user may get different payoff when he adopts his friend X  X  behavior at different time. This time-dependent user payoff enables the GT model to predict the temporal dynamics of information diffusion process.
In the proposed GT model, the diffusion process unfolds in discrete time-steps t , and begins from a given initial active user set. When a user v observes a piece of information at time t , he calculates his payoffs for different choices depend-ing on his neighbors X  status so as to make strategic decision. If he adopts the information, his status becomes activated at time t +1. We next describe the proposed model in detail.
In a social network, we first consider the simplest situation in which a user has two possible choices, A and B , when he observes a piece of information. As an example, we can imagine the information is a tweet in Twitter, choice A is retweeting the tweet and choice B is not. For a user v facing his one neighbor u , the payoffs of his different choices are defined as: If u and v both choose A , v gets payoff a uv ( X  t ). If u and v both choose B , v gets payoff b uv ( X  t ). If u choose A and v choose B , v gets payoff c uv ( X  t ). If u choose B and v choose A , v gets payoff d uv ( X  t ).  X  t = t u  X  t v denotes the time delay between user u and v making the choice. Based on these different choices of u and v , a payoff matrix of user v is generated as shown in Fig.1(a). Figure 1: (a) is the payoff matrix of user v ;(b)shows user v makes choice between A and B depending on all of its neighbors X  choices.

Fig.1(a) is the situation on a single edge in the network, i.e. only considers one neighbor of user v .Ingeneral,the choice of v depends on all of his neighbors X  choices as shown in Fig.1(b). The total payoff of v is the sum of all individual payoffs that he gets when faces each single neighbor. Here we use N A ( v )todenotethesetof v  X  X  neighbors who adopt choice A ,and N B ( v ) the set of neighbors who adopt choice B .Ifuser v adopts choice A at time t v , he will get payoff: Similarly, if v adopts choice B at time t v , he will get payoff: Finally, between these two choices, user v will make the deci-sion that maximizes his payoff. Therefore, if payof f A ( v, t payof f B ( v, t v ), user v will make choice of A at time t he will adopt choice B .

In the following, we will present a method to calculate user payoffs of his different choices in different situations, i.e. the payoff matrix in Fig.1(a). Considering two linked users, u and v , an intuitive explanation of our method is: themorepayoffuser v has gotten in the past by following user u  X  X  choices, the greater tendency v will have (can be regarded as: the more payoff he will get) at this time to make the same choice as user u . Based on this concept, we explore both the global influence and social influence for the payoff calculation. Global influence shows the authority of a user while social influence reflects the degree to which one user has affected another. Specifically, the greater global influence user u has and the greater social influence shown between user u and user v , the more payoff user v will get if he makes the same choice as user u . This calculation method is not limited by any specific diffusing information, thus it is applicable to different diffusing information in different social networks. Based on the description above, we define the payoff matrix of user v facing his neighbor u as We can see, if user v adopts the behavior different from user u ,hegetsnopayoff;elseifuser v adopts the same behavior as u , the global influence and social influence are jointly explored to measure his payoff. Next, we will present a new social influence calculation method which can fully capture the temporal dynamics of social influence between users.
Many efforts have been made for the research of social influence. However, only the CT Model and DT Model pro-posed by [8] consider the time factor. CT model describes the social influence by an exponential decay function. It has Figure 2: An example of social influence between two users on Sina Weibo dataset. a significant drawback in that it assumes that the social in-fluence follows an exponential distribution. DT Models set the influence at a constant value within a time window. Due to the rough simulating mechanisms, it is difficult for the CT and DT models to capture the complex dynamics of social influence between users. In this work, we propose a new method for accurate representation of the social influence. We represent the social influence function as a non-negative vector with length K , where the k th component social uv denotes the social influence of user u on his neighbor v at time k andisdefinedas social uv ( k )=
Fig.2 shows an example of the social influence represented by our method on Sina Weibo dataset. We can see that, in contrast with the CT and DT model, our proposed method can accurately capture the temporal dynamic properties of social influence between users.

Finally, we highlight that the GT model is not only ap-plicable to the situation with two choices on one piece of information, but can also deal with the situations with more choices on multiple pieces of information.
Global Influence. In this work, we use two methods to learn the global influence of individual user: 1) Pagerank Algorithm. In [2], the pagerank algorithm is used to calculate the importance of web pages based purely on the link structure of the World Wide Web. Here, we em-ploy it to the social networks for global influence calculation. 2) Diffusion Cascades. Diffusion cascades triggered by a piece of information that a user adopts directly indicates this user X  X  global influence. Therefore, it is reasonable to use the average size of diffusion cascades [1] as the measurement.
Social Influence. In order to calculate the social influ-ence, we use our proposed method as described in Section 3, which considers the influence function as a non-negative vector with length K : Algorithm 1 illustrates how to calculate the element social based on the diffusion cascades. For the parameter K ,dif-ferent value is assigned for different dataset by statistical methods which will be discussed in detail in Section 5.
Based on the GT model proposed in Section 3, we present the Algorithm 2 for predicting the information diffusion pro-cess. This algorithm focuses on the question of whether a user will perform a behavior at time t .Forauser u ,ifhehas already performed the behavior, we assume that u is active; Algorithm 1 Social influence calculation. 1: For each social link ( u, v )do 2: For k =1to K do 3: social uv ( k )= count uv ( k )=0; 4: End 5: End 6: For each dif f ( a, u, v,  X  t )  X  diffusion cascades do 7: If k  X  1 &lt;  X  t&lt;k Then count uv ( k )++; 8: End 9: For each social link ( u, v )do 10: For k =1to K do 11: social uv ( k )= count uv ( k ) / | A u | ; 12: End 13: End if he has not performed the behavior yet but at least one of his neighbors did, we assume that u is inactive.

Datasets. Given the social network and action log, we evaluate the proposed model on two datasets.
For different datasets, the maximum diffusion time de-lay K adopts different values in social influence function. Fig.3(a) and (b) show the quantity of information diffusion Figure 3: Distributions of information diffusion quantity over time delay. Figure 4:Prediction performances on Weibo dataset. Figure 5: Prediction performances on Flickr dataset. over time delay on Sina Weibo dataset and Flickr dataset. Both of them have a long-tail shape. In Sina Weibo dataset, 81.5% of diffusion actions are performed with the time de-lay less than 24 hours, so we set the parameter K at 24 (24 hours/1 hour). In Flickr dataset, 85.0% of diffusion actions are performed with the time delay less than 90 days, so we set the parameter K at 30 (90 days/3 days).

Baseline methods. We compare the proposed GT model with the closest work of [8], where two time-dependent mod-els, CT model and DT model, are presented for capturing social influence, then they are applied together with gen-eral threshold model to predict time-dependent information diffusion. Since in [8], the CT model got better prediction performance than DT model, we here compare our proposed method with the method that combines CT model and gen-eral threshold model. For our method, we employ two kinds of methods to calculate user X  X  global influence, pagerank and diffusion cascades, which achieve different accuracies.
Evaluation. We adopt three measurements to evaluate these tested prediction methods, which are Precision, Recall and F1-Measure.
For each information a in testing dataset, given its diffu-sion progress before time t (0 : t  X  1), our goal is to predict which users will be activated by this information at time t . In our experiment, we assume that the user observed the behaviors of all his neighbors for each information.
Fig.4 and Fig.5 show the prediction performances of all the tested approaches under different measurements at 7 time steps (time 2-8) on Sina Weibo and Flickr dataset. We can see that the proposed GT model (either using pager-ank or diffusion cascades for global influence calculation) can consistently achieve better performance comparing with baseline method [8]. The baseline method highly depends on the activation threshold of users which are hard to set. A same activation threshold value is assigned for all users in their work while in fact different users have different ac-tivation thresholds. Therefore, the predicting performances of [8] are uncompetitive. In contrast, our model, strate-gically considering all the interacting users, improves the performance dramatically.

Furthermore, we can also see that the GT model using dif-fusion cascades for global influence calculation achieves bet-ter prediction performance than that using pagerank. This is mainly because the pagerank method only analyzes the topology structure of network while diffusion cascades are mined from both the network structure and user behaviors, so using diffusion cascades method can get more accurate influence value than using pagerank method. These results illustrate that when our model is fed with more accurate parameters, it shows better performance in prediction task. This is a good sanity check of our model.

As shown in Fig.4 and Fig.5, the curves of the baseline method under three measurements are decreasing with time, demonstrating the loss of the prediction ability as time goes on. In contrast, our model achieves pretty better and time-independent performance. This is because in our model the prediction for a user X  X  behavior doesn X  X  rely on any of his neighbor X  X  activation time. The GT model combines both hisactiveandinactiveneighborstomeasurehispayoffsof different choices and then gives a reliable prediction.
We have presented a novel information diffusion model in this paper. It regards the users in a social network as intelligent agents, and jointly considers all the interacting users to make strategic prediction. By introducing the time-dependent payoffs, the model has the capability to predict the temporal dynamics of information diffusion process. Both the global influence and social influence are explored for user payoff calculation, where the social influence representation method is newly designed for fully capturing its temporal dynamics. Experimental results have confirmed the ratio-nality and effectiveness of the proposed model.
