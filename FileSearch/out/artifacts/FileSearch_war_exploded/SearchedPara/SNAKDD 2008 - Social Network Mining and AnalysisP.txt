 In this report, we summarize the contents and outcomes of the recent SNAKDD 2008 workshop on Social Network Min-ing and Analysis that was held in conjunction with the 14th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Dis-covery and Data Mining (KDD 2008), August 24-27, 2008, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The SNAKDD 2008 is the second in a successful series of workshops on social network mining and analysis. It solicited papers on broad overview subject  X  X ocial Network Mining and Analysis X . The workshop drew a large number of participants from academia and industry. In this report we reflect on the results of the workshop, as captured in the regular paper session as well as the poster session.
 Social network analysis, community discovery, web mining, evolution The second SNAKDD  X 2008 is the second in a successful series of workshops on social network mining and analysis. It aims to bring together practitioners and researchers wit h a specific focus on the emerging trends and industry needs associated with a variety of social networking systems. The first SNAKDD workshop was co-held with WebKDD 2007 at SIGKDD 2007 conference in San Jose, California. The second SNAKDD workshop focuses on the emerging trends and industry needs associated with a variety of socia l networking systems, encompassing lessons learned over the past years and new challenges for the years to come. The workshop received submissions including experimental and theoretical work on social network mining and analysis. There were 32 papers submitted to SNAKDD 2008. Each of the papers was strictly reviewed by at least three review-ers from the SNAKDD 2008 program committee. Due to the quality and diversity of the submissions, we accepted 11 papers as regular papers and 8 as poster papers. The work-shop papers are divided into four categories based on their topics: (1) Social network models, (2) Community discov-ery and extraction, (3) Social dynamics and evolution, and (4)Social network applications. The workshop attracted interests from a large number of conference participants. Among them included participant s from academia and government agencies, Web related in-dustry, as well as practitioners from other companies. The paper,  X  X ombining Transitive Trust and Negative Opin-ions for better Reputation Management in Social Networks X  [5] , authored by Debora Donato, Stefano Leonardi, and Mario Paniccia, focuses on reputation management model and investigates the role of users X  negative opinions in de-centralized systems. In this paper the authors propose a new approach to combine negative and positive opinions ex-pressed by peers to reach a global consensus on trust and dis-trust values for each peer of the network. The experiments show that these strategies outperform previous strategies in terms of number of successful transactions against a large set of sophisticated threat attacks posed by coalitions of malicious peers.
 The paper,  X  X seudolikelihood EM for Within-Network Rela-tional Learning X , authored by Rongjing Xiang and Jennifer Neville [17], compares three in-sampling learning approac hes [17], including disjoint learning with independent infere nce, disjoint learning with collective inference, and joint lea rning with collective inference, by developing a pseudolikeliho od-EM method that facilitates learning collective classificat ion models with both unlabeled and labeled data in the same network. The authors discuss the experiment results on the three approaches.
 The paper,  X  X onparametric Relational Learning for Social Network Analysis X  [18], by Zhao Xu, Volker Tresp, Shipeng Yu, and Kai Yu, discusses how the infinite hidden relational model (IHRM) model can be used to model and analyze so-cial networks, where each edge is associated with a random variable and the probabilistic dependencies between these variables are specified by the model based on the relational structure. The hidden variables are able to transport infor -mation such that non-local probabilistic dependencies can be obtained. The IHRM provides effective relationship pre-diction and cluster analysis for social networks. The exper -iments demonstrate that this model can provide good pre-diction accuracy and capture the inherent relations among social actors. The paper,  X  X dequacy of Data for Characterizing Caller Be-havior X  [15], by Santi Phithakkitnukoon and Ram Dantu, investigates phone users X  behaviors and constructs a proba -bility models based on callers call arrival, inter-arrival , and talk time from the call logs in order to predict or estimate the future observation. The authors focus on the question that how much historical data is adequate for prediction purpose.
 The paper,  X  X ocial Topic Models for Community Extrac-tion X  [14], by Nishith Pathak, Colin DeLong, Arindam Baner-jee, and Kendrick Erickson, presents a Bayesian generative model for community extraction which incorporates both the link and content information in the social network. The model assumes that actors in a community communicate on topics of mutual interest, and the topics of communication determine the communities. The model is evaluated on the Enron email corpus and the results demonstrate that the model is able to extract well-connected and topically mean-ingful communities. The paper,  X  X ommunication Dynamics of Blog Networks X  [9], by Mark Goldberg, Malik Magdon-Ismail, Stephen Kel-ley, Konstantin Mertsalov, and William Wallace, studies th e communication dynamics of Blog networks by exploring the Russian section of LiveJournal. The two fundamental ques-tions that this paper is concerned with include (1) what models adequately describe such dynamic communication behavior; and (2) how does one detect changes in the nature of the communication dynamics. The paper leverages  X  X ta-ble statistics X  in their research in disclosing the dynamic s of the networks and characterizing the locality properties. The paper,  X  X ntology Engineering and Feature Construc-tion for Predicting Friendship Links in the Live Journal Social Network X  [2], by Vikas Bahirwani, Doina Caragea, Waleed Aljandal, and William Hsu, addresses the problem of building an interest ontology and predicting potential friendship relations between users in Live Journal, using f ea-tures constructed based on the interest ontology. The goal o f this paper is to organize users X  interests in an ontology and to use the semantics captured by this ontology to improve the performance of learning algorithms at predicting if two users can be friends. We have designed and implemented a  X  X ybrid clustering X  algorithm, which combines hierarchic al agglomerative and divisive clustering paradigms, and auto -matically builds the interest ontology. Furthermore, we ha ve explored the use of this ontology to construct interest-bas ed features and shown that the resulting features improve the performance of various classifiers for predicting friendsh ip links.
 The paper,  X  X ikis as Social Networks: Evolution and Dy-namics X  by Ralf Klamma and Christian Haasler [11], ana-lyzes wikis as social networks by applying dynamic network analysis techniques. In particular, the authors handle the complex data management problems arising when dealing with different wiki engines and different sizes of wiki dumps. The analysis and visualization of evolving wiki networks al -low wiki stakeholder to research the social dynamics of thei r wikis.
 The paper,  X  X vercoming Resolution Limits in MDL Com-munity Detection X  [4] by Karl Branting, studies the resolu-tion limit problem with two compression-based algorithms that were designed to overcome such limit. The author iden-tifies the aspect of each approach that is responsible for the resolution limit and proposes a variant, SGE that addresses this limitation. The paper demonstrates on three artificial data sets that (1) SGE does not exhibit a resolution limit on graphs in which other approaches do, and that (2) modular-ity and the compression-based algorithms, including SGE, behave similarly on graphs not subject to the resolution limit. The paper,  X  X roup Proximity Measure for Recommending Groups in Online Social Networks X  [16], by Barna Saha and Lise Getoor. investigates the problem of defining proximity measure between groups/communities of OSN in order to reveal new insights into the structure of the network. The authors use this proximity measure in a novel way with other structural features of online groups to predict the evolvin g state of the network and propose a new framework for rec-ommending groups to users of OSNs. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of our methods in three real OSNs: Flickr, Live Journal and You Tube.
 The paper,  X  X  Social Query Model for Decentralized Search X  [3], by Arindam Banerjee and Sugato Basu, introduces a novel Social Query Model (SQM) for decentralized search, which factors in realistic elements such as expertise level s and response rates of node. In the context of the model, the authors design a query routing policy that is simultaneousl y optimal for all nodes, in that no subset of nodes will jointly have any incentive to use a different local routing policy. For computing the optimal policy, the paper presents an ef-ficient distributed approximation algorithm that is almost linear in the number of edges in the network. Extensive ex-periments on both simulated random graphs and real small-world networks demonstrate the potential of our model and the effectiveness of the proposed routing algorithm. Due to the number of high quality submissions that we have received and limited workshop time, we create a poster ses-sion in addition to the regular paper session. There were 8 papers that were presented poster papers. The topics of these papers include: graph mining, such as  X  X  Resampling Technique for Relational Data Graphs X  [6] (by Hoda El-dardiry and Jennifer Neville); and  X  X inding Spread Blocker s in Dynamic Networks X  [10] (by Habiba, Yintao Yu, Tanya Berger-Wolf, and Jared Saia). , community discovery and detection, such as the paper,  X  X ommunity Detection using a Measure of Global Influence X  [8] (by Rumi Ghosh and Kristina Lerman), and the paper,  X  X arge-Scale Principal Component Analysis on LiveJournal Friends Network X  [12] (by Miklos Kurucz, Andras A. Benczur, and Attila Peres-zlenyi); as well as prediction and classification, includin g the paper,  X  X sing Friendship Ties and Family Circles for Link Prediction X  [19] (by Elena Zheleva, Lise Getoor, Jen-nifer Golbeck, and Ugur Kuter),  X  X omparative analysis of tag suggestion algorithms X  [13] (by Steffen Oldenburg, Mar-tin Garbe, Clemens Cap and Lukas Zielinski),  X  X  Shrinkage Approach for Modeling Non-Stationary Relational Autocor-relation X  [1], (by Pelin Angin and Jennifer Neville); and  X  X everaging Label-Independent Features for Classificatio n in Sparsely Labeled Networks: An Empirical Study X  [7] (by Brian Gallagher and Tina Eliassi-Rad). The SNAKDD 2008 workshop continued a tradition of ex-posing strong and ever more innovative research in critical areas of social network mining and analysis, including soci al network modeling, growth and dynamics, applications, and community discovery. The workshop also rendered discus-sions that helped raise several questions and bring to light several interesting future directions and challenges in th e area of social network mining and analysis.
