 we mainly discuss SCOC. Since K.H.Tung put forward a clustering question COE (Clustering with Obstacles cently: COD-CLARANS [2] based on the Partitioning approach of CLARANS, AUTOCLUST+ [3] based on the Graph partitioning method of AUTOCLUST, exist in them [6]. 
PKSCOC based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and K-Medoids is pre-the Quantum PSO algorithm, and the paper [10-12] presented the Chaotic PSO algo-famous benchmark problems in all cases. The contrastive experiments show that PNPKSCOC is better than PKSCOC in terms of quantization error and has higher constringency speed than GKSCOC. showed in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes the paper. 2.1 Classical PSO PSO is a population-based optimization method first proposed by Kennedy and Eber-pbest p p p = K is its best position searched by now, and the whole particle Vvv v = K is the position change rate of the th i particle. Each particle updates its position according to the following formulas: where new velocity, the particle flies towa rd a new position according to Eq.2. 2.2 Coordinate PSO with Dynamic Pi ecewise Linear Chaotic Map and Dynamic 2.2.1 Dynamic Piecewise Linear Chaotic Map The well-known Piecewise linear chaotic map is defined as follows [10]: inertia weight which is described in equations (4) and (5).

We can use Dijkstra Algorithm to compute obstructed distance. The simulation re-3.2 Spatial Clustering with Obstacles Constraints by Improved K-Medoids nition can be defined as: the direct Euclidean distance between the two points p and q . quality of spatial clustering with obstacles constraints can be revised as: 
The method of IKSCOC is adopted as follows [4]. 1. Select N c objects to be cluster centers at random; 2. Assign remaining objects to nearest cluster center; 3. Calculate o E according to Eq.9; 4. While ( o E changed) do {Let current o EE = ; 5. Select a not centering point to replace the cluster center m j randomly; 6. Assign objects to the nearest center; 7. Calculate E according to Eq.8; 8. If E &gt; current E , go to 5; 9. Calculate o E ; 10. If o E &lt; current E , form new cluster centers}. 3.3 Spatial Clustering with Obstacles Constraints Based on PNPSO and is, each particle i X is constructed as follows: objective function is defined as follows:
