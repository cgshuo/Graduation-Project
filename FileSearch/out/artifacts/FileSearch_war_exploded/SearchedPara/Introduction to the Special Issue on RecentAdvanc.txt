 1. INTRODUCTION This special issue on Recent Advances in Asian Language Spok en Document Retrieval of the ACM Transactions on Asian Language Informa tion Process-ing is devoted to recent advances in the burgeoning field of sp oken document processing of Asian languages. Rapidly increasing spoken l anguage content from the various audio media sources such as radio, televisi on, lectures, and telephony recordings has led to an increasing demand for more effective automatic indexing and retrieval of these relatively unstr uctured spoken documents. Yet, just like text documents, spoken documents can be described by attributes such as subjects, topics, and semantic concep ts. As such, the vast amount of spoken documents available should be as acces sible to us as are text documents. However, unlike handling text docume nts which are better structured, for example, with titles, headings, and paragraphs, re-trieving and browsing spoken documents relies heavily on th e performance of speech recognition engines, which are still far from perf ect. For this special issue, we encouraged submissions that report on novel techn iques for tasks such as spoken document retrieval, spoken document summari zation, spo-ken document translation, and other related areas of resear ch. Of particu-lar interest are studies that directly address problems inv olving spoken Asian languages.
 excerpts from a large collection of spoken documents based o n a user X  X  request. SDR is the key element in many applications such as v oice search, voice surveillance, voice data mining, and call center auto mation. As an in-terdisciplinary research involving automatic speech reco gnition, natural lan-guage processing, and information retrieval, the area of SD R has benefited much from the advances in speech and language processing as w ell as from the availability of large spoken databases. The valuable co ntent in these large audio archives needs to be accessed in an effective yet pract ical way. This need in turn gives rise to the area of spoken document summari zation, which seeks to distill salient information while removing redund ant, incorrect in-formation from spoken documents to produce user-friendly, skim-able spoken document summaries. Research problems, such as informatio n extraction and spoken summary generation, are our main focus in the area of s poken docu-ment summarization. uments across different languages. With accelerated globa lization and the growth of spoken multilingual content, we are driven to look into speech-to-speech translation with a higher level of urgency. Spoken la nguage, known to have its unique manifestation, is rather different from w ritten text. In the field of SLT, we face challenges such as flexible grammatical e xpressions, data sparseness, and imperfect transcripts.
 tions of high-quality research work, their rapid dissemina tion, and thorough discussions of basic and applied research results. The call -for-papers had re-ceived an enthusiastic response, with each submitted artic le reviewed by three or more technical reviewers in several rounds. At the end of t he review, three of these articles were selected for this issue, out of nine ar ticles submitted. We are very pleased with the quality of the accepted articles. 2. ARTICLES IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE The research included in this special issue covers topics th at are important in the field, ranging from new computational models for spoke n document re-trieval and summarization to novel techniques in hypothesi s generation for spoken document translation. The three articles were selec ted out of nine in-ternational submissions and these works do reflect the depth of the challenging problems faced by researchers in spoken document processin g.
 Retrieval and Transcription X  by Chen, discusses the use of a word topical mixture model (WTMM) to explore the cooccurrence relations hip between words, as well as the long-span latent topical information f or language mod-eling in spoken document retrieval and transcription. The d ocument, and the search history as a whole, is modeled as a composite WTMM mode l for gener-ating a newly observed word. The underlying characteristic s and the different types of model structures are thoroughly investigated in th is work. for Chinese Spoken Document Summarization X  by Lin et al., pr esents a com-parative study of various probabilistic ranking models for spoken document summarization, including the supervised classification-b ased summarizer and the unsupervised probabilistic generative summarizer. A n ovel training data selection approach X  X ne that leverages the relevance infor mation of spoken sentences to select reliable document-summary pairs deriv ed by the probabilis-tic generative summarizer X  X s explored for the training of t he classification-based summarizer.
 Translation X  by Chen et al., capitalizes on the strength of p hrase-based and syntax-based methods while proposing a strategy of mult iple hypotheses generation method in a two-stage framework for spoken langu age translation. The hypotheses are generated in two stages, first in the decod ing stage where state-of-the-art, phrase-based, and syntax-based method s are applied to gener-ate basic translation hypotheses. Next, in the regeneratio n stage, many more hypotheses that cannot be captured by the decoding algorith ms are produced from the basic hypotheses.
 interesting research problems in the field of spoken documen t processing. New methods have been proposed in these works with their prelimi nary implemen-tations well proving their worth. It is our hope that these wo rks will inspire new research ideas among readers and spur innovative though ts for future research.
 We would like to thank all the authors who submitted their art icles and responded to the reviewers under a very tight schedule. Our s pecial thanks go to the reviewers for their tremendous effort in the techni cal review process as well as for their constructive comments that helped to imp rove the quality of the manuscripts.
