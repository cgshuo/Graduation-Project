 A common practice in comparative evaluation of informa-tion retrieval (IR) systems is to create a test collection com-prising a set of topics (queries), a document corpus, and relevance judgments, and to monitor the performance of re-trieval systems over such a collection. A typical evaluation of a system involves computing a performance metric, e.g., Average Precision (AP), for each topic and then using the average performance metric, e.g., Mean Average Precision (MAP) to express the overall system performance. How-ever, averages do not capture all the important aspects of system performance, and, used alone, may not thoroughly express system effectiveness. For example, the average can mask large variations in individual topic effectiveness. The author X  X  hypothesis is that, in addition to average perfor-mance, attention needs to be paid to how a system perfor-mance varies across topics. We refer to this performance variation as Volatility .

The main purpose of the thesis is to introduce the con-cept of performance volatility and apply it to information re-trieval. There are several ways in which the volatility might be defined. One obvious definition is to use the standard de-viation (SD) of the AP values from their MAP. An alterna-tive definition might be compute the expected performance using a subset of queries, and then measure the deviation of held-out queries from this prediction. Another definition could be based on  X  X nterquartile range X  [1].

Our initial investigation has used SD as a measure of volatility. Using SD to measure volatility has the bene-fit that it is a well-understood and well-studied quantity. However our preliminary experiments, which calculated a straightforward SD of per-top ic performance scores, high-lighted a problem. Typically, scores are bounded between [0,1]. As a result, we observed that systems with low MAP exhibited lower volatility. This bias can be eliminated by applying a score standardization [3] or logit transformation to the AP values, in which case, the range of values is now (  X  X  X  , +  X  ).

One application of volatility is in the evaluation of systems effectiveness. Following standard practices in experiment analysis, it is beneficial to consider both the mean and the volatility of performance (e.g. AP) across topics. Of course, variance is routinely used within IR to assess the statisti-cal significance of measurements. However, two systems can have statistically equivalent mean values of performance, yet exhibit quite different variances. In such a situation, we may prefer low/high volatile systems. For example, we can con-sider a minimum level for average performance, say MAP. Consequently, if MAP scores are smaller than such a thresh-old, we prefer volatile systems and hope to gain a satisfying AP scores at least for a part of topics, and if MAP scores are bigger than the threshold vice versa. Indeed such a strategy is consistent with the TREC robust track [2] where the main goal was to improve the consistency of systems evaluation by considering the impact of good and poorly performing topics equally.

Another application of volatility may be in performance prediction. Here, performance volatility is due to several fac-tors. Performance prediction involves a measurement step followed by a prediction step. During the measurement step, we are given a collection, a set of queries, and correspond-ing results together with relevance judgments. During the prediction step, we can consider three different scenarios. The first scenario predicts s ystem performance on differ-ent topic sets (queries) but the same document collection as used during the measurement step. The second scenario predicts performance on a different document collection but the same topic set. The third scenario predicts system per-formance for both a different topic set and document collec-tion. Volatility may be useful in judging the quality of these predictions.
