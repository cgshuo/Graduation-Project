 1 Collaboratively constructed language resources 1.1 Rise of collective intelligence In recent years, collective intelligence has become a field of active research due to the rise of Web 2.0 and the availability of Web-based technologies that support distributed collaboration. Malone et al. ( 2009 ) define collective intelligence broadly as  X  X  X roups of individuals acting collectively in ways that seem intelligent. X  X  The applications of this phenomenon are wide-reaching: recent publications (Malone 2004 ; Howe 2008 ; Surowiecki 2004 ; Benkler 2006 ; Tapscott and Williams 2006 ), and a compendium of nearly 250 examples of Web-based collective intelligence collected by the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence 1 clearly demonstrate the diversity of ways in which collective intelligence can be applied. The field is now about to consolidate itself and launch its own conference which will be held for the first time in 2012. 2
Collective intelligence has recently become a means to offset the high costs of language resource development, and a focus of some current research is the computational linguistics community may look to the significant body of research on this topic already undertaken in fields such as computer science, cognitive science, sociology, and organizational psychology, to name just a few. For example, Malone et al. ( 2009 ) identify four dimensions of the application of collective intelligence: Who is doing it (Staff) , What is done (Goal) , Why it is done (Incentives) , and How it is done (Structure/Process) . By analyzing the underlying structure and mechanisms of collective intelligence, they try to understand what is effective in which situations and provide a set of conditions for the usefulness of certain design decisions regarding the applications of collective intelligence. Such findings can facilitate the application of collective intelligence to language resource development; however, to date such work has not been widely accessed by the language resources community. This special issue of Language Resources and Evaluation is intended to take a step in that direction. 1.2 Emergence of a research community In recent years, the language resources community has seen an increasing amount of work involving the application of collective intelligence to support natural language processing (NLP). Web-based collaboratively constructed language resources (CCLRs) that include contributions by ordinary Web users have been successfully used as a substitute for conventionally-constructed language resources or corpora. In particular, collaboratively constructed resources have been used to help overcome the  X  X  X nowledge acquisition bottleneck X  X  and coverage problems that plague conventional language resources. The most prominent examples include the collaboratively constructed encyclopedia Wikipedia, the collaboratively constructed dictionary Wiktionary, Open Mind ( http://www.openmind.org ), which gathers general knowledge from willing contributors, and other resources compiled through the use of collective intelligence tools, such as Games with a Purpose or Mechanical Turk .

The increasing interest in CCLRs within the community has been demonstrated by a series of successful meetings at major NLP conferences, e.g. the  X  X  The People X  X  Web meets NLP: Collaboratively Constructed Language Resources  X  X  workshops at ACL-IJCNLP 2009, 3 COLING 2010 4 and ACL 2012, 5 the NAACL 2010 workshop  X  X  Creating Speech and Language Data With Amazon X  X  Mechanical Turk  X  X , the LREC 2012 workshop on  X  X  Collaborative Resource Development and Delivery  X  X  , a s well as ACL conference tracks dedicated to NLP for Web , Wikipedia , and Social Media . Conferences on the topic in related fields have also attracted interest among NLP researchers, for example, the AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media. 6 The benefits of collaboratively constructed resources come with new challenges. In the area of knowledge extraction, for example, interoperability of collaboratively constructed resources with existing resources is a concern, since such information typically must be merged, or at least used with existing resources. The issue of the quality of the extracted knowledge is especially important for their usability; such information often lacks editorial control and may be incomplete or erroneous. These challenges may in fact provide an opportunity to use NLP to improve the quality of collaboratively constructed resources, e.g., by guiding the  X  X  X rowds X  X  while they shows. Thus, NLP may ultimately not only benefit from collective intelligence techniques, but also contribute to their effectiveness as well. 1.3 Scope of this special issue At least two types of collaboratively constructed language resources are of interest to the language resources and collective intelligence communities: (1) those such as Wikipedia and crowdsourcing, where the general public contributes content and annotations, and (2) those such as MASC (Ide et al. 2010 ) that solicit contributions of content and annotations from the language analysis community. Particular research areas related to both resource types include but are not limited to:  X  Analyzing collaboratively contributed content, such as wiki-based resources,  X  Using special features of collaboratively contributed content to create novel resource  X  Extracting knowledge from collaboratively-constructed resources to be  X  Enabling interoperability of CCLRs and conventionally-constructed language  X  Mining collaboratively contributed content for constructing structured language  X  Mining multilingual information from collaboratively constructed resources;  X  Crowdsourcing the construction of linguistic annotations;  X  Leveraging community collaboration to construct language resources and  X  Applying game-based approaches to resource construction;  X  Applying Mechanical Turk for collecting data to be used on various language  X  Measuring quality and reliability of collaboratively constructed language resources. 1.4 Tools and intermediate results Work on collaboratively constructed language resources has already resulted in a series of widely applicable outcomes. Below, we list just a few examples to direct the interested reader to further readings:  X  Conventionally-and collaboratively-constructed resources have been aligned on  X  Large-scale disambiguated resources, ontologies 8 and multiword term invento- X  Non-expert annotators have been employed to construct a linguistically  X  Text generation and lexical simplification have been addressed in several works
Increased usage of collaboratively constructed language resources in NLP depends on the availability of software tools to programmatically access the contained knowledge. Tools for Wikipedia ( JWPL , 11 Wikipedia Miner 12 )or Wiktionary ( JWKTL 13 ) have already been published, but the majority of CCLRs still lack such support. This topic will have to receive increased attention from the research community in the future to facilitate the adoption of the research results. 2 Papers in this special issue topics in the fields of collective intelligence and language resources , such as (1) the use of crowdsourcing to generate training data for machine learning algorithms, (2) the use of web-based platforms to collaboratively annotate linguistic corpora, (3) the semi-automatic construction of lexical semantic resources through mining Wiktionary, and (4) the construction of a word sense inventory with results from Amazon Mechanical Turk and using it for a lexical substitution task.

Although the papers in this special issue cannot cover the full range of current research involving CCLRs because of limited space, the topics represent a broad sample that should provide an ample taste of work in the field. In the following, we describe the main contributions of the accepted papers in more detail:
A OBO W ANG ET AL . analyze different types of crowdsourcing as a new method to obtain annotations for training machine learning models in their article  X  X  X erspec-tives on Crowdsourcing Annotations for NLP X  X . They discuss a set of approaches to crowdsourcing, such as Games with a Purpose , Amazon Mechanical Turk ,or Wisdom of Crowds . This last approach encompasses applications where the general public collaborates to build a resource, such as Wikipedia or Wiktionary. Furthermore, they evaluate the crowdsourcing approaches with respect to criteria such as motivation, annotation quality, setup effort, human participation, and the character of the task. They come up with a set of recommendations to select the appropriate crowdsourcing approach for a particular language analysis task. K AIS D UKES ET AL . apply supervised collaboration for syntactic annotation of Quranic Arabic. The Quranic Arabic Corpus is first automatically processed and then subject to collaborative proofreading on the web site which attracts thousands of visitors per day, from whom about 100 unpaid annotators are recruited. The article critically evaluates and reports on the effectiveness of the chosen annotation methodology, while discussing the unique challenges of annotating Quranic Arabic online. It also discusses the custom linguistic software employed to aid the process of collaborative corpus annotation.

F RANCK S AJOUS ET AL . utilize the Wisdom of Crowds to construct and validate lexical semantic resources online in their article  X  X  X emi-Automatic Enrichment of Crowdsourced Synonymy Networks: The WISIGOTH system applied to Wiktion-ary X  X . They point to the lack of comprehensive and reliable lexical semantic resources for language analysis as a major bottleneck for the development of language processing capabilities for many languages. They provide an in-depth description of Wiktionary as a collaboratively constructed dictionary, and propose a semi-automatic approach for enriching the Wiktionary synonymy network based on random walks. The Wiki technology is further utilized to propose a validation by the Web users, implemented in their WISIGOTH system.

Finally, C HRIS B IEMANN creates a system for lexical substitutions from scratch using crowdsourcing. This work constructs a word sense inventory through the use of Amazon Mechanical Turk . Substitutions for target words are induced and clustered by sense, accompanied by collecting the corresponding contexts. The resulting resource contains a large number of target word contexts annotated by senses and is thus suited for training a supervised word sense disambiguation system or lexical substitution system. The work demonstrates that the amount and the quality of the data gathered from Mechanical Turk is sufficient for producing high-quality substitutions automatically. 3 Future research directions Work on collaboratively constructed language resources started only a few years ago and has not yet reached its peak. We expect that in the coming years, the community will continue to build upon current efforts, including both tools for various tasks and resources that have already been constructed by exploiting collective intelligence.

We see the next major step in the field to be the effective use of CCLRs to enhance the performance of algorithms in a wide range of NLP tasks. For this purpose, it is crucial to investigate ways to deal with issues surrounding the quality of the data collected within the collective intelligence paradigm. This research necessitates interdisciplinary interactions between the language processing com-munity and related disciplines concerned with collective intelligence. The editors of this special issue hope that the papers contained in this issue provide a timely and useful survey of the state-of-the-art in the field, from which further development and maturation can proceed in the years to come.
