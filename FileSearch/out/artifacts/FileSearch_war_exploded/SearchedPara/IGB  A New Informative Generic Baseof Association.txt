 The problem of the relevance and usefulness of extracted association rules is of primary importance. Indeed, in most real life databases, thousands and even millions of high-confidence rules are generated, among which many are redun-dant. This problem encouraged the development of tools for rule classification, according to their properties, for rule selection according to user-defined criteria, and for rule visualization. The Selection without loss of information is mainly based on the extraction of a generic subset of all association rules, called generic base , from which the remaining (redundant) association rules are generated. IGB . Through IGB , we introduce a novel characterization of generic association rules instead of the classical one, i.e. , exact and approximative. In fact, we shall distinguish between the  X  factual  X  X ndthe X  implicative  X  generic association rule. Indeed, a factual generic association rule, fulfilling the premise part emptiness, permits to highlight item correlation without any conditionality. However, for an implicative generic association rule, where the premise part is not empty, item correlation is conditioned by the existence of premise items. The introduced generic base IGB fulfills the  X  X nformativeness property X , i.e. , the support and the confidence of the derived association rules can be exactly retrieved. In order to derive valid association rules from the IGB base, we introduce an axiomatic system, which it is shown to be valid and complete.

 basic mathematical foundations for the derivation of generic bases of association rules. We devote section 3 to a review of the literature relating to the extraction of the generic bases. Section 4 introduces a novel informative base of generic association rules and the associated axiomatic system. Results of the experiments carried out on real-life databases are reported in section 5. The conclusion and future work are presented in section 6. Due to lack of available space, interested reader for key results from the Galois lattice-based paradigm in FCA is referred to [1].
 Frequent Closed Itemset: An itemset I  X  X  is said to be closed if I =  X  ( I ), and is said to be frequent with respect to the minsup threshold if support(I)= Minimal Generator: An itemset g  X  X  is said to be minimal generator of a closed itemset I , if and only if  X  ( g )= I and does not exist g  X  g such that  X  ( g )= I [3, 4].
 Iceberg Galois Lattice: When only frequent closed itemsets are considered with set inclusion, the resulting structure (  X  L ,  X  ) only preserves the join opera-tor [1]. This is called a join semi-lattice or upper semi-lattice. In the remaining of the paper, such structure is referred to as  X  Iceberg Galois Lattice  X  [5]. Therefore, given an Iceberg Galois lattice in which each closed itemset is  X  X ecorated X  with its associated list of minimal generators, generic bases of association rules can be derived in a straightforward manner. Indeed, generic approximative rules repre-sent  X  X nter-node X  implications, assorted with the confidence measure, between two comparable equivalence relation classes, i.e. , from a sub-closed-itemset to a super-closed-itemset when starting from a given node in the partially ordered structure [6].
 Example 1. Let us consider the formal context K given by Figure 1 (Left). The associated Iceberg Galois lattice, for minsup=1, is depicted by Figure 1 (Right) 1 . Each node in the Iceberg is represented as a couple (closed itemset, support) and is decorated with its associated minimal generator list. The problem of the relevance and the utility of the association rules is of primary importance. This is due to the high number of the association rules extracted from the real-life databases and the presence of the high percentage of redun-dant rules conveying the same information. In the literature, we can witness the presence of some techniques to prune such set of rules, mainly based on statis-tical metrics [7]. In what follows, we put the focus on the results issued from the FCA, to retrieve a reduced set of rules without information loss. Indeed, this reduced set, called base , is composed of generic rules and should fulfill the following requirements:  X   X  Informativeness X : The generic base of association rules, allows to re- X   X  Derivability  X : An inference mechanism should be provided ( e.g ., an ax-A critical review of the dedicated literature permitted to mainly report the following previous works: 1. Representative Rules: In [8], Kryszkiewicz introduced a new syntactic 2. Generic basis for exact association rules and Informative basis for The couple of generic bases proposed by Bastide et al. is informative. However, it suffers from a huge number of generic association rules. The extraction of generic base RR ( RB ) is the smallest rule set covering all valid association rules by means of the cover operator. However, it is not information lossless. Hence, our contribution consists in introducing a new approach permitting to extract infor-mative generic base for association rules which is more compact than ( GBE , GBA ). Thus, we begin by redefining association rule-redundancy as follows: Definition 1. Let AR be the set of all association rules that can be derived from an extraction context K .R:X  X  Y  X  X R is redundant with respect to R 1 : X  X  Y 1.  X  ( XY ) =X 1 Y 1 2. X 1  X  X  X  Y  X  Y 1 Based on the former definition, we introduce the following definition of the new generic base called IGB : Definition 2. Let FCI be the set of frequent closed itemsets and G I the set of minimal generators of a frequent closed itemset I.
 IGB = { R:g s  X  (I-g s ) | I  X  X CI X  I =  X  X  X  g s  X  X  I ,I X   X  X CI X  I X   X  I  X  confidence(R)  X  minconf  X  g /g X   X  g s  X  confidence(g  X  I-g )  X  minconf } . Proposition 1. The generic base IGB is informative, i.e. , the support and the confidence of all derived rules can be exactly retrieved from IGB .
 Proof. Our approach consists in finding for each non empty frequent closed item-set I, the smallest minimal generator g s of a frequent closed itemset I X  subsumed by I and fulfilling the minconf constraint. Thus, generic association rules of IGB have the following form: g s  X  I-g s . Therefore, we are able to reconstitute all fre-quent closed itemset by concatenation of the premise and the conclusion parts of a generic rule. Since the support of a frequent itemset is equal to the support of the smallest frequent closed itemset containing it, then the support and the confidence of all derived rules can be exactly retrieved. 4.1 The IGB Generic Base Construction The IGB construction algorithm takes as input the set of all frequent closed itemsets FCI extracted by using one of the dedicated algorithms 2 .
 Proposition 2. Let I be a non empty frequent closed itemset, if support(I)  X  minconf, then the generic association rule R:  X  X  X  I  X  X GB .
 Proof. Proposition 2 derives straightforwardly from Definition 2. Since confi-dence (R:  X  X  X  I)=support(I), then the generic rule  X  X  X  I is valid. Hence, R presents the largest conclusion that can be drawn from the frequent closed item-set I since there is no another rule R X :X X   X  Y X  such that X X   X  X  X  and I  X  Y X . The IGB construction algorithm is based on Proposition 2. So, it considers the set of frequent closed itemsets FCI . For each non empty closed itemset I, it checks whether its support is greater than or equal to minconf . If it is the case, then we generate the generic rule R:  X  X  X  I. Otherwise, it has to look for the smallest min-imal generator g s , associated to a frequent closed itemset subsumed by I, and then generates the generic rule R:g s  X  I-g s if the minconf threshold is reached. Example 2. Let us consider the extraction context given by Figure 1 (Left). Table 1 shows the running process of the IGB construction algorithm for minsup = 7 and minconf = 4.2 Generic Association Rule Semantics In the following, we have to discuss semantics attached to an association rule R:X c  X  Y-X. Usually, R expresses that the probability of finding Y with a value c depends on the presence of X. Thus, X constitutes a constraint for the correlation Y items. In the IGB base, we can find generic association rules whose premise part can be empty. Such rules were considered in [9, 10], but very little attention was paid to a semantic interpretation attached to this type of knowledge. conf = 1 7 and applying Bastide et al. approach, we obtain among the possibly extracted generic association rules, c  X  egk, e  X  cgk, g  X  cek, k  X  ceg. How-ever, does the correlation probability of the items c, e, g and k depend on the presence of c, e, g or k? Actually, the probability of the correlation of c, e, g and k with a value greater than or equal to minconf does not depend on any condition. Thus, we propose to represent such type of correlation by only one generic association rule, i.e. ,R:  X  X  X  cegk. The generic base IGB contains then two types of knowledge: ( i ) X  Implicative knowledge  X  represented by a generic association rule whose the premise part is not empty. ( ii ) X  Factual knowledge  X  represented by a generic association rule whose the premise part is empty. 4.3 Redundant Association Rule Derivation In order to derive the set of all valid redundant association rules, we propose in what follows an axiomatic system and we prove that it is valid ( i.e. , should forbid derivation of non valid rules) and that it is complete ( i.e. , should enable derivation of all the valid rules).
 Proposition 3. Let us consider the generic base denoted by IGB and the set of all valid association rules extracted from K , denoted by AR . The following axiomatic system is valid.
 A0. Conditional reflexivity: If X c  X  Y  X  X GB X  X =  X  then X c  X  Y  X  X R A1. Augmentation: If X c  X  Y  X  X GB then X  X  Z c  X  Y-{ Z } X  X R ,Z  X  Y. A2. Decomposition: If X c  X  Y  X  X R then X c  X  Z  X  X R ,Z  X  Y  X   X  ( XZ ) = Proof. A0. Conditional reflexivity: follows from the proper definition of the
A1. Augmentation: Since X c  X  Y  X  X GB then confidence(X c  X  Y)=c  X 
A2. Decomposition: Since, X c  X  Y  X  X R then confidence(X c  X  Y)=c  X  min-=  X  ( XY ), then support(XZ)=support(XY) consequently, support(XZ) = c  X  support(X). Thus, X c  X  Z is a valid associative rule.
 Remark 1. The constraint of non emptiness of the the premise was introduced in respect to an implicit  X  X abit X  stipulating that the premise part of an association rule is usually non empty.
 Proposition 4. The proposed axiomatic system is complete: the set of all as-sociative rules extracted from K are derivable from IGB by using the proposed axiomatic system.
 Proof. Let IGB be the generic base extracted from the extraction context K for given minsup et minconf. AR denotes the set of all association rules extracted from K and FCI the set of frequent closed itemsets.
 Let R:X  X  Y-X  X  X R . In the following, we have to show that R can be de-rived from a generic association rule of IGB by the application of the proposed axiomatic system.  X  If Y  X  X CI then two cases are possible:  X  Otherwise, it exists a rule R X :X  X  Y X -X  X  X R such that Y X   X  X CI X   X  ( Y ) We carried out experimentations on benchmarking datasets, in order to evaluate the number of generic association rules. We implemented algorithms in the C language under Linux Fedora Core 2. Physical characteristics of the machine are: a PC pentium 4 with a CPU clock rate of 3.06 Ghz and a main memory of 512 Mo.

Indeed, when minconf is less than 100%, the compactness degree of IGB ranges from 0.4% to 80%. Conversely to sparse datasets, compactness degree is limited to a value varying between 41% and 100%. This gap widens by lowing support values. The compactness degree of RR base ranges from 0.06% to 80% for dense datasets, while it ranges from 26% to 100% for sparse datasets. For sparse datasets, ( GBE , GBA ) contains the set of all valid rules. This is can be explained by the fact that for sparse datasets, the set of frequent itemsets is equal to the set of frequent closed itemsets and the set of minimal generators. However, for dense datasets, the compactness degree of ( GBE , GBA ) varies between 8% and 80%. In this paper, we introduced a novel informative generic base, for association rules which is more compact than ( GBE , GBA ). We also provided a valid and complete axiomatic system, composed of the conditional reflexivity, augmenta-tion and decomposition axioms, permitting to derive the set of all valid rules. We distinguished between two types of generic rules;  X  factual  X  and  X  implicative  X  ones. We also implemented algorithms of IGB , ( GBE , GBA ) and RR construc-tant profits in terms of compactness of the introduced generic base. In the near tion.
