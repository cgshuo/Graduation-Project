 ORIGINAL PAPER GuoXianTan  X  Christian Viard-Gaudin  X  Alex C. Kot Abstract Allograph prototype approaches for writer iden-tification have been gaining popularity recently due to its simplicity and promising identification rates. Character prototypes that are used as allographs produce a consistent set of templates that models the handwriting styles of writers, thereby allowing high accuracies to be attained. We hypoth-esize that the alphabet knowledge inherent in such char-acter prototypes can provide additional writer information pertaining to their styles of writing and their identities. This paper utilizes a character prototype approach to establish evi-dence that knowledge of the alphabet offers additional clues which help in the writer identification process. This paper then introduces an alphabet information coefficient (AIC) to better exploit such alphabet knowledge for writer identifica-tion. Our experiments showed an increase in writer identi-fication accuracy from 66.0 to 87.0% on a database of 200 reference writers when alphabet knowledge was used. Exper-iments related to the reduction in dimensionality of the writer identification system are also reported. Our results show that thediscriminativepowerofthealphabetcanbeusedtoreduce the complexity while maintaining the same level of perfor-mance for the writer identification system.
 Keywords Writer identification  X  Allograph  X  Alphabet  X  Online handwriting  X  Information retrieval 1 Introduction Writer identification from handwritten documents garners much attention in both the scientific community and com-mercial world, as this is a field that sees an ever increasing range of applications such as in areas of forensic analysis, biometric security systems, author identification of old music scores, identification of writer profiles for writer adaption, or even authorship identification of handwritings that are written on smart whiteboards [ 1  X  6 ]. Recent works in writer identification observe an increasing trend of approaches that utilizes allograph prototypes [ 7  X  11 ]. Such approaches for writer identification have been gaining popularity due to its simplicity and promising identification rates. Among these allograph approaches, some works focus on producing a set of character prototypes to use as their allographs [ 10 , 11 ]. The advantage of working at the character level is that a set of con-sistent templates can be produced to model the handwriting styles of writers. Furthermore, working at the character level allows visualization by forensic experts to help guide them in theirforensicanalysisofthehandwritingsofindividuals[ 12 ].
Handwritings of individuals vary distinctly across differ-ent cultures, occupations, physical attributes, and even phys-iological factors as discussed by Huber et al. [ 13 , 14 ]. Writer identification exploits this individuality of handwriting styles in the analysis of the handwriting to differentiate different writers apart. Handwriting analysis has traditionally been used in the field of forensic document analysis by foren-sic experts. Forensic experts utilize a foray of techniques to compare the handwritings of individuals for forensic analy-sis, and one common technique is to examine closely letters of the Latin alphabet that are unique to certain individuals [ 14 , 15 ]. Hence, this raises the question of whether alphabet knowledge contains individuality about the writer informa-tion that can be exploited in automatic writer identification systems. In order to answer this question, we first begin by clearly defining the terminologies of alphabet and letters used in this paper. According to the definitions given by Merriam-Webster, Cambridge and Oxford dictionary, the alphabet is a set of letters with which one or more languages are written. Henceforth, in this paper, the term letter is used to describe an occurrence of the Latin alphabet system. An example of the letter of the Latin alphabet could be  X  X  X ,  X  X  X , or  X  X  X . Fur-thermore, there commonly exist multiple  X  X ccurrences X  or  X  X nstances X  of a given letter in a document. These different instances of the same letter when written by different writ-ers are innately different from one another. However, some of the shape variants of these instances appear more simi-lar to one another. Hence, such instances could be grouped together and defined as representing the same allograph of this letter, which is a graphical variant of this letter. Thus, by analyzing the usage of the different allographs of each letter set, it is possible to model the handwriting style and consequently attempt to retrieve the identity of the writer.
One of the questions raised in this paper is to determine whether it is important to assume the identity (the label) of a given instance of a letter. Of particular interest is whether alphabet knowledge can provide any concrete physical evi-dence in facilitating the identification of writers in writer identification systems. Multiple studies relating to the study of the discriminative power of certain letters of the Latin alphabet in the identification of writers [ 16  X  18 ] have been conducted with no particularly strong conclusive evidence. Therefore, we attempt to view this problem from another per-spective and use alphabet knowledge as an aiding tool to help the clustering of allograph features into prototypes instead. Our motivation lies in establishing if alphabet knowledge contains additional clues that can help ascertain the identity of the writer. In doing so, we can justify the promising results [ 10 , 11 , 19 ] obtained by allograph prototype approaches that make use of characters to build the allograph templates. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a review of the state-of-the-art in writer identification.Section 3 thengoesontodescribetheproposed methodology and experimental setup. Thereafter, Sect. 4 describes the database used and presents the experimental results. Finally, discussions and the future directions in our research are given in Sect. 5 . 2 Previous works One of the pioneering works in establishing a formal quanti-tative analysis of handwriting individuality can be credited to studies by Srihari et al. [ 18 , 20 , 21 ]. Pattern recognition tech-niques were used to provide objective assessments and scien-tific validations of the individuality in handwriting. In their work, both local and global features were extracted on a data-base of 1,500 individuals stratified across different genders, age groups, and ethnicities. A nearest neighbor algorithm and a three-layered neural network are then used to train and classify the results for writer identification and writer verifi-cation, respectively. Their results verified the hypothesis that individuality exists in handwriting with a 95% confidence from a statistical inference of the entire US population.
Such individuality studies allowed expert testimonies from skilled document forensic specialists to be treated with scientific rigor and become admissible as court evi-dences. Furthermore, these studies also paved the way for the development of numerous automatic writer identification and verification systems over this past decade. These studies pro-vided scientific evidence to prove that the individuality of handwriting styles allows handwriting analysis to be con-sidered as a behavioral biometric trait that can differentiate between different people [ 14 , 22 ]. Since then, the fundamen-tal assumption underlying most state-of-the-art writer iden-tification systems is that writers can be differentiated based on the uniqueness of their handwriting styles. The various writer identification systems then attempt to model the dif-ferent styles of writings of writers by using a multitude of approaches. The existing literature of writer identification makes use of a vast array of methods such as the morpholog-ical approach [ 23 ], HMM-based approach [ 24 , 25 ], Fourier transformation approach [ 26 , 27 ], and the allograph proto-type approaches [ 28 , 29 ].

An increasing trend in recent years observes the rise of more allograph prototype approaches being utilized in writer identification systems [ 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 ]. Bulacu et al. [ 8 ] gen-erated a codebook of graphemes and combined them with features at the texture level to represent the various hand-writing styles. An identification rate of 92% was attained on a dataset of 650 writers who wrote English text. Bense-fia et al. [ 29 ] proposed a sequential clustering approach at the grapheme level to categorize different writers for their writer identification system. This approach attained an identification rate of 86% on a reference set of 150 writers who wrote English text. Chan et al. [ 19 ]clus-tered allographs at the character level and created statisti-cal distributions to model the handwriting styles of writers. A top-1 accuracy of 95% was achieved based on this text-independent approach which considered 82 reference writers who wrote French texts. The advantage of this method is that it is more consistent at the character level as opposed to using the grapheme or word level. Tan et al. [ 11 ] designed and implemented a fully automatic writer identification frame-work to model the handwriting styles of different writers using character prototypes. A fuzzy c-means algorithm was utilized on a database of containing 240 French documents from 120 writers, which attained an identification accuracy of 99%. Niels et al. [ 12 ] used dynamic time warping to hier-archically cluster allographs that were manually segmented. A set of membership vectors, which contains the frequency of occurrence of each allograph for each character, was then built to model the handwriting styles. This prototypic tem-plate of membership vectors then represented the handwrit-ing styles of the different writers. A top-1 accuracy of 100% was reported based on a database of 43 writers who wrote English texts. However, dynamic time warping approaches are computational expensive. Furthermore, it is difficult to cover all variations in handwriting during the training of the prototypes, and dynamic time warping is highly sensitive to the absence of prototypes. Therefore, dynamic time warping will not be able to give the expected results if a new varia-tion in handwriting that was not previously covered during the training of the prototype were to appear [ 12 ]. Table 1 provides a brief summary of the state-of-the-art in writer identification that uses allograph prototype approaches.
From the review of the current state-of-the-art described in this section, the following conclusions can be derived. Firstly, grapheme-based prototype approaches are able to identify writers with high accuracies that prove to be very promising. Secondly, there is an advantage in identifying writers at the character level. Writer identification at the character level provides a visualization tool to aid forensic experts make an informed decision. Furthermore, working at the character level allows for more consistent allograph prototypes to be formed. Therefore, this paper attempts to explain and justify the numerous works that use allograph prototypes for writer identification, in particular, the results obtained from recent works that use allographs at the character level to model the handwriting styles [ 10 , 11 , 19 ]. Such works extract writer information and attempt to model the handwriting styles at the character level. Hence, alphabet knowledge is implicitly present in such methodologies. Our main contributions that are presented here are as follows: (1) Our results show that the use of alphabet knowledge improves the writer identifica-tion rate. (2) We introduce the concept of alphabet informa-tion coefficient (AIC) to improve the performance of a writer identification system. (3) We present a method to reduce the system complexity by considering the discriminative power of different letters of the Latin alphabet. 3 System architecture In this paper, we propose using alphabet knowledge to aid in the clustering of the allographs in order to build the distribu-tion of prototypes that are representative of the handwriting styles of writers. An alphabet information coefficient (AIC) is also introduced during classification to take into consider-ation the effects of different letters of the Latin alphabet. Two writer identification systems are built; one that uses alpha-bet knowledge, and one where alphabet knowledge is omit-ted. The writer identification system without using alphabet knowledge allows for comparison with the system that uses alphabetic information. The approaches for both systems are described and compared in the sections that follow. 3.1 Methodology without alphabet knowledge The writer identification system without using alphabet knowledge can be broadly divided into three main stages, namely the prototype training stage, the document labeling stage, and finally the classification stage. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The purpose of the prototype training stage is to build a set of character prototypes to model the different hand-writing styles. The character prototypes are built and trained using the IRONOFF database [ 30 ] of 16585 isolated French words written by 373 different subjects. The segmentation of the characters to build the set of character prototypes is done by an industrial text recognition engine, MyScript [ 31 ]. After segmentation, the segmented characters then undergo further preprocessing and feature extraction as described in our previous work [ 11 ]. Subsequently, the segmented charac-ters are then clustered using a k-means clustering algorithm [ 32 ] into 260 prototypes all at the same time in the feature space, without any alphabetic information. Thereafter, in the document labeling stage, the same segmentation engine is used to automatically segment the documents at the charac-ter level. Each of the segments extracted from a document is then mapped to the set of prototypes and transformed into a distribution of frequency vectors. This is done by using the fuzzy c-means approach described in our previous work [ 33 ]. Finally, in the last classification stage, frequency vectors are then classified to identify the writers using a variation of the Chi-square distance measure, as depicted in ( 1 ). Dist writer i , writer j = where idf k is the inverse document frequency, and tf k , sents the term frequency of the reference and test documents, where k refers to the k th prototype, and i refers to writer i . N stands for the number of prototypes that are being clus-tered, where N = 260 in this case. In ( 1 ), we have adapted the standard idf and tf measures from traditional document analysis literature [ 34 ] to address our writer identification problem. In our framework, idf k and tf k , i are used to create a statistical distribution that models the handwriting styles of different writers. This distribution then enables us to clas-sify and perform an identification of the writer in question. A detailed account of the inverse document frequency and term frequency is given in our previous work [ 35 ]. 3.2 Methodology using alphabet knowledge This system is also broadly divided into three main stages, where the mechanics of each stage is as previously explained and shown in Fig. 1 . The difference is that for this meth-odology that makes use of alphabetic information, the allo-graphs are clustered into a total of 260 prototypes with the help of alphabetic knowledge during the first prototype train-ing stage. This means that after segmenting the characters as done in the previous methodology, they are subsequently recognized into their respective letters of the Latin alphabet and clustered into allographic prototypes according to their corresponding letters as well. This proposed methodology in using alphabet knowledge makes use of the recognition capabilities of MyScript [ 31 ] to automatically recognize the segmented characters into their respective letters of the Latin alphabet. A choice of a set of ten clusters for each letter of the Latin is chosen based on the work done by [ 33 ]. Hence, there is a common set of 26  X  10 = 260 prototypes to model the handwriting style of each writer. Thereafter, in the docu-ment labeling stage, the same segmentation and recognition tools are used to segment and label the online handwritings of a writer document at the character level. Next, according to their letters of the Latin alphabet, each of the extracted characters is then mapped to the set of the ten prototypes on a letter-by-letter basis and transformed into a distribution of frequency vectors. Finally, in the last classification stage, the frequency vectors are then classified to identify the writers. The AIC is introduced during this stage to specifically weigh each letter of the Latin alphabet as shown in ( 2 ). The reason is that using this second method, the distributions over the prototypes are computed on a letter-by-letter basis. Conse-quently, 26 distributions are obtained instead of a single one as with the first method. Some of these distributions are more reliable than others, and it is the goal of the AIC to give more weight to the more reliable distributions.

In ( 2 ), idf k and tf k , i have the same connotations as ( 1 ), L is the number of prototypes that are being clustered, per letter of the Latin alphabet and is chosen to be L = 10 as explained previously. The AIC is being calculated for all letters  X  the Latin alphabet,  X   X  {  X  a  X  ,  X  b  X  ,...,  X  z  X  } , which we have designed three different expressions for modeling this AIC function. These expressions are defined by ( 3 ), ( 4 ), and ( 5 ), where C  X  i represents the number of characters or instances of the letter  X  of the Latin alphabet that appears in the docu-ment of reference writer i . Likewise, C  X  j represents the total number of characters for test writer j and in ( 5 ),  X  is a tuning parameter which is experimentally set to be 0.01. The design of these expressions for modeling the AIC function will be discussed more in details in Sects. 4.3 and 4.4 .

The distance defined by ( 2 ) is derived from a Chi-squared metric, where it is used to match the two distributions: one from a test writer, another from a reference writer. It intro-duces a relative comparison between the components of the distributions, instead of focusing on the absolute difference between them like with a Euclidian distance. This is more meaningful with respect to the different handwriting styles that we are attempting to make a distinction of. It has also given the best results in the study conducted by Schomaker [ 36 ].
 Here, we have introduced the concept of the AIC in ( 2 ). The AIC is a measure of reliability of the character prototypes being built from the distribution of the letters of the Latin alphabet available in the documents. As the distributions are estimated from the counting of the number of instances of each letter, it is evidently clear that the reliability of these distributions is dependent on the number of samples encoun-tered. The higher the number of samples of a letter of the Latin alphabet that are present in a text, the more reliable the distribution for this letter should be. Conversely, with very few samples, eventually none that exist for this letter of the Latin alphabet in either the test document or the reference document of a given alphabet, it becomes undesirable that the corresponding distribution has an important weight in the global distance function and should eventually be totally discarded. Hence, the AIC has to take into account the num-ber of characters that are present in both the reference and test document during classification. 4 Experimental results 4.1 Database Online handwritten documents were collected from 200 writ-ers where the writers copied text passages from the Reuters financial news corpus, Reuters-21578 [ 37 ]. Figure 2 illus-trates a typical online handwritten sample that was collected. Reuters-21578 is a very popular publicly available finan-cial news corpus initially intended for text categorization research, and it contains a collection of different categories of financial newswire from Reuters.

Each writer was requested to copy two different text pas-sages, with a digital pen and paper technology: one which is considered as a reference document, and the second one is taken as a test document from randomly selected news cat-egories of Reuters-21578. Figure 3 shows the form used to collect the samples from the writers. These reference and test documents that were collected belong to a separate dataset from the IRONOFF database, which is only used for build-ing the prototype set of characters. The IRONOFF database was chosen for this task of building the character prototypes, because it contains a wide selection of handwriting styles from 373 different writers that is consequently large enough to be representative of the different variations in handwrit-ing styles. As a result, the character prototype set is generic and independent with respect to the actual reference data-base of documents from which the writer is to be identified from. Furthermore, a separate database needed to be col-lected, because the IRONOFF database contains only iso-lated words and hence are not representative of actual online documents.
As can be seen from Figs. 2 and 3 , each online docu-ment on average consists of only three to ten lines of text and contains shorthand that exists in financial news jargons. For example, mln (circled in Fig. 3 ) that stands for million is commonly used in financial terms. As illustrated in Fig. 4 ,the automatic recognizer tool might confuse the word  X  X ln X  for  X  X en X , since it is an out-of-lexicon word. Next, Fig. 5 shows the wrongly recognized character  X  X  X  that will be utilized later during writer identification. Such character recognition errors are not removed before trying to identify the writers, so that a realistic and practical scenario can be reflected, since such errors are inevitable in reality. A character recog-nition rate of 89% was achieved on this database using the MyScript[ 31 ]industrialtextrecognitionengine.Thisimplies that, when using alphabet knowledge as defined in Sect. 3.2 to help in the assignment to the corresponding prototype set, 11% of the characters will be assigned wrongly. For instance, in the previous example that illustrated the incorrect recognitionof theword X  X ln X , a X  X  X  that is wronglyrecognized as an  X  X  X  will be erroneously clustered to the set of prototypes for letter  X  X  X  of the Latin alphabet. Hence, the prototype fre-quency estimation will be corrupted by noise because of the presence of such inevitable recognition errors.

Nonetheless, the choice of the recognition engine has no specific link to the proposed method. In our experiments,  X  X yScript X  was chosen, because it is an off-the-shelf product that contains convenient built-in resources, while offering the possibility to create specific linguistic resources. Any other recognition system can equally be used to implement the pro-posed method. The better the segmentation and recognition capabilities of the recognition engine is at recognizing the letter, the higher the writer identification rate will be. Hence, the proposed method has no reliance on any one specific rec-ognition engine and other recognition engines can be used in tandem if a writing style is very odd and not well supported by any one recognition engine. 4.2 Effect of alphabet knowledge Table 2 compares the top-1 writer identification rate between theapproachwithoutusinganyalphabetknowledgetohelpin clustering and the approach with using alphabet knowledge to help in clustering. When alphabet knowledge was omitted in helping to cluster, an accuracy of 66.0% was achieved (68 misclassified writers out of 200). In contrast, with the help of alphabet knowledge to cluster the distribution of prototypes at the character level, we see that the alphabetic approach resulted in a higher top-1 identification of 73.5%. This translates into a misclassification error of only 53 out of 200 writers in the top-1 position. Alphabet knowledge provides additional knowledge on the handwriting styles. There exist different morphological variations even among different let-ters of the Latin alphabet. For example, the letter  X  X  X  has more morphological variations and styles to write it when compared to the letter  X  X  X , where only a limited number of variations exist. Therefore, it will help in the identification of writers if we are able to examine certain letters more closely. With the assistance of this alphabet knowledge, clustering the graphemes or allographs into prototypes to model the handwriting styles of writers will be able to provide a higher writer identification rate, as evidenced from our results.
Thisimprovementofthewriteridentificationrateservesas further evidence to suggest that alphabet knowledge do influ-ence the recognition of writers. This can be explained by the fact that in our proposed methodology, we make use of alpha-bet knowledge to cluster the prototypes into clusters of  X  X  X  to  X  X  X . It must be highlighted that even though the identification rate reported here is much lower compared to our previous work [ 11 ] and works by Chan et al. [ 19 ] and Niels et al. [ 10 ], the reader should bear in mind that the Reuters database of 200 writers is much more challenging to recognize due to the shorter length of text in the documents and a higher segmen-tation error, as previously discussed in Sect. 4.1 .The effect of the transition from no AIC being used (73.5%) to using AIC (76.5 X 87%) will be discussed next in Sect. 4.3 . 4.3 Effect of the AIC It is observed that certain letters of the Latin alphabet such as  X  X  X ,  X  X  X , or  X  X  X  have infrequent occurrences for the English language, since they rarely appear in most English texts. This might cause distortions to the prototype distributions created if the instances of such letters are not sufficiently consistent to completely model the writing style of that letter of the Latin alphabet. The AIC serves to eliminate this bias by attrib-uting less importance during classification to those letters which rarely occur in either the reference or test documents. This effectively places more emphasis to those letters that are able to sufficiently represent the writer X  X  style of writ-ing. Hence, the AIC is a measure of reliability where more importance is attributed to prototypes that can reliably repre-sent the handwriting styles of that writer in order for a higher writer identification rate to be attained.

WhennoAICis usedin( 2 ), all letters aretreatedas equally reliable in representing the writer X  X  handwriting style. This is equivalent to assigning a same weight of 1 to the AIC for all letters of the Latin alphabet. However, for the stepwise AIC shown in ( 3 ), letters that do not appear in either the ref-erence or test documents are deemed as unreliable and thus omitted. As seen from Table 2 , the stepwise AIC improves the top-1 writer identification rate from 73.5 to 76.5% when the stepwise AIC is used. This set of results highlights the fact that the reliability of the character prototypes that we use to model the handwriting styles is in fact dependent on the distribution of the letters available in the documents. When no instances of the letter appears in either the test or reference document, then that character prototype should not be used in the determination of the writer identity. This is consistent with the results obtained where an increase in accuracy is attained when the stepwise AIC is used when compared to when no AIC is used.

However, the failure of the stepwise AIC becomes appar-ent when letters of the Latin alphabet containing very few samples are used to model the handwriting style. In such cases, it becomes detrimental to the identification rate if such distributions still have an important weight in the global dis-tance function. This is also why we have designed other AIC functions to take into consideration the reliability of the pro-totypes under such circumstances. A good choice of AIC should give higher reliability to letters of the Latin alpha-bet that occur frequently and reduce the reliability to rarely occurring letters that are not sufficient enough to effectively model the handwriting style. As seen in Table 2 , a good choice of AIC will result in the further increase in the accu-racy from 76.5 to 87%. The design of the AIC will be dis-cussed next in Sect. 4.4 . 4.4 Design of the AIC A series of experiments have been conducted to further investigate the design of different AICs. Equation 3 uses a step-wise AIC function, so that it prevents using a letter of the Latin alphabet when no instances of this letter are encoun-tered in either the test or reference document. All other letters are given the same weight. In this case, the results attained 76.5% for the top-1 identification rate. When ( 4 ) is consid-ered, the geometric mean of the sample numbers is used as a weighting factor, thereby preserving the previous property of discarding letters when no instances of the letter of the Latin alphabet is observed while increasing the weight for the most representative letters. A significant improvement in the top-1 identification is observed where an accuracy 86.5% is attained when ( 4 ) is used. Equation 5 uses a sigmoid func-tion to saturate the influence of the number on occurrences of a given letter. It is in our interest to limit those letters that are extremely frequent such as  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  from being overemphasized by the AIC during the classification.
The tuning parameter  X  , when experimentally set to be 0.01, results in the sigmoid function that is illustrated in Fig. 6 . With such a value of  X  , the AIC becomes saturated to a value of 1 when approximately 20 occurrences of the same letter have been encountered in each document. This effectively means that we do not require more than 20 occur-rences of a letter from each document in order to reliably model the allograph distribution for that letter. In addition, we can see from Table 2 that the usage of this sigmoidal AIC achieved a top-1 accuracy of 87.0%. This is a slight improvement compared to the AIC using the geometric mean where a top-1 accuracy of 86.5% was attained. Upon closer examination, we observed that an identification rate of 98% can be attained with the sigmoidal AIC if we relax our con-straints and consider the top-9 positions, as shown in Fig. 7 (i.e., the writers are considered correctly identified if they can be ranked within the top-9 positions). However, for the AIC described by ( 4 ), the same identification rate of 98% can only be attained if we consider the top-19 positions. Therefore, our experiments show that the sigmoidal AIC can effectively improve the performance of the writer recognition system.
The choice of  X  affects how quickly saturation of the sig-moid function is reached. As  X  approaches a very large value, it behaves similarly to a step function as described in ( 3 ). The physical interpretation of such a step function AIC is that we exclude those cases when no instances of such letters exist in either the reference or test documents. Likewise, we attri-bute equally all other letters of the Latin alphabet that contain some instances of the letters in both the reference and test documents. From Table 2 , we see that the step function AIC performs only slightly better than the case when no AIC is used; achieving an identification rate of only 76.5% (47 mis-classified writers) compared to an identification rate of 73.5% when no AIC is used. This result is to be expected, because those letters where only 1 or 2 instances appear in the docu-ments should be given less importance, as they might not be sufficiently consistent to represent the prototype distribution. Hence, the value of  X  should not be too large. Conversely, if the value of  X  is too small and approaches 0, this will have the same effect as when AIC is not used. Based on our experiments, we have found the optimum value of  X  to be 0.01. 4.5 Discriminative power of different letters of the Latin Certain letters of the Latin alphabet allow for more variations to be written compared with other letters, thereby allowing different writers to express their individuality of handwrit-ing with a style that is more distinctive and differentiated. For example, the letters of the Latin alphabet  X  X  X  has more morphological variations and styles in its approach of writ-ing compared to the letter  X  X  X , where only a limited number of variations exist. This implies that most writers might inad-vertently write the letter  X  X  X  with a similar style. Therefore, we hypothesize that different letters of the Latin alphabet will have different capabilities in identifying writers, and we refer tothis termas thediscriminativepower of letters. Exper-iments were conducted to verify this hypothesis by using only one letter at a time to identify the writers. For example, in order to investigate the discriminative power of the letter  X  X  X , only the letter  X  X  X  was used from the reference and test docu-ments in the document indexing stage and the retrieval stage. The top-1 accuracy in writer identification was then obtained by considering only writers who have the letters of the Latin alphabet  X  X  X  in both their reference and test documents. Writ-ers who do not have any letter  X  X  X  in either the reference or test document are omitted in the ranking results. This pro-cess is then repeated for the other letters of the Latin alphabet. Four letters, namely,  X  X  X ,  X  X  X ,  X  X  X , and  X  X  X  were omitted for the purpose of this experiment, since these letters rarely appear in the documents and will skew the results if included. The outcome of this experiment is illustrated in Table 3 .
From Table 3 , the second column indicates the top-1 accu-racy obtained when only that particular letter is used in performing writer identification. The results supported our hypothesis that certain letters of the Latin alphabet like  X  X  X  might have fewer variations of writing and hence will have a low discriminative power in writer identification. Likewise, letters like  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  are highly discriminative in writer identification. Results reported by our previous works [ 11 ] on French documents are similar to the results obtained here for English documents; with the notable exceptions that  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  are more discriminating in the French documents (top-2 and top-4, respectively, in [ 11 ]), and that  X  X  X  was the least discriminating in [ 11 ]. These slight differences are due to the fact that English and French documents are still inherently different. Nonetheless, this experiment clearly shows that different letters of the Latin alphabet have different identi-fication capabilities, which also supports findings from Cha et al. [ 17 , 18 ]. Therefore, more emphasis should be placed on such alphabets with high discriminative powers and less emphasis on those with low discriminative powers. The third column of Table 3 shows the frequency of occurrence of such letters in both the test and reference documents. This distribu-tion of alphabet frequency is similar to the results obtained by Foster [ 38 ] based on the Brown Corpus of US English words, where the most frequent letters are  X  X  X ,  X  X  X , and  X  X  X , and the least frequent letters are  X  X  X  and  X  X  X .

In many pattern recognition scenarios, one of the critical tasksinanylarge-scalepracticalsysteminvolvesreducingthe computational complexity of the system such as seeking to minimize features that are redundant. The method proposed by [ 11 ] involves clustering in a feature space of dimensional-ity 210 for each letter, compounded by the fact that this has to be repeated for all 26 letters of the Latin alphabet. This issue can be addressed by using only a subset of Latin alphabet instead. We demonstrate the feasibility of using the discrim-inative power of the letter to determine a subset. Figure 8 shows the drop in performance, as the letters of the Latin alphabet are removed based on the order of their discrimi-native power. The experimental results show that the perfor-mance remains constant, as the least discriminating letters are removed ( X  X  X ,  X  X  X ,  X  X  X , etc.). Conversely, we suffer a drastic drop in the performance as the most discriminating letters are removed ( X  X  X ,  X  X  X ,  X  X  X , etc.). Degradation in the perfor-mance is already observed even with the removal of one dis-criminating letter. Our results indicate that a choice of letters based merely on their discriminative power can be utilized to select a subset of alphabets without adverse impact to the performance of the writer identification system. This will help to reduce the dimensionality and decrease the compu-tational complexity of the system. As evidenced from our results, this method of using the discriminative power to select a subset, albeit sub-optimal, is a much simpler and effective approach compared to other more complex and time-consuming subset selection algorithms. 5 Discussions Alphabet knowledge contains valuable information pertain-ing to the identity of the writer. This is demonstrated from the experimental results of an improvement in the writer identi-fication rate from 66.0 to 73.5% based on a set of 200 refer-ence writers using the Reuters-21578 corpus when alphabet knowledge is considered. Furthermore, with the introduction of the alphabet information coefficient AIC, we are able to achieve higher accuracies of 87.0%. A study into the AIC design reveals that it is the sigmoidal variation of the AIC that enables to give us this slightly higher top-1 identification rate of 87.0% when compared with the 86.5% obtained with the geometric mean version. Upon closer examination, our results reveal that a 98% identification can be attained at the top-9 positions with the sigmoidal AIC when compared to the top-19 positions with the AIC in ( 4 ). The optimum choice of  X  was also found to be 0.01 from our experiments. A large value of  X  is similar to a stepwise AIC, and our results show that the stepwise AIC performs poorly with a top-1 identifica-tion rate of only 76.5%. This poor result is expected, because cases where only 1 or 2 instances of the letter in the docu-ment are not sufficiently consistent to properly represent the prototype distribution. On the same note, a small value for will result in a poor identification rate as well. In fact, as approaches 0, it has the same effect as when AIC is not used.
The individuality of alphabet knowledge has been demonstrated from our experimental results, where building prototype templates at the character level retain significant information relevant to the writer. Since alphabet knowledge exists inherently when the prototype templates are built at the character level, this verifies our hypothesis that alpha-bet knowledge contains individuality about the writer information. Therefore, alphabet knowledge helps in the identification of writers by allowing certain letters of the Latin alphabet that are more relevant to certain writers to be closely examined. For this reason, the results presented in this paper explain why works that made use of character pro-totype approaches for writer identification are able to attain promising results. Hence, we foresee advantages in exploit-ing this individuality of alphabet knowledge, especially in automatic writer identification systems.

We also established the notion of the discriminative power of different letters of the Latin alphabet and the feasibility in utilizing such information toward reducing the dimensional-ity and complexity of the writer identification. Even though the concept of using the discriminative power of letters has been shown to be feasible, some open issues remain. One underlying assumption here is that the letters are indepen-dent of one another. This might not necessarily be the case if co-dependencies between letters of the Latin alphabet exist. Hence, future work will be to take such co-dependencies into account when selecting a subset based on the discriminative power. Another open issue will be how to adapt this discrim-inative power of letters to specific writers. This way, we will be able to determine letters which can be ignored for those writers based on the discriminative power of letters for that specific writer. These issues will be addressed in our future work.

Another area of improvement is that our AIC currently only considers the total number of instances of that letters of the Latin alphabet in both the reference and test documents. While this is sufficient to achieve a good writer identifica-tion rate, it ignores valuable information that can be extracted from the distribution of characters between the reference and test document. For example, if we have a ratio for of 10:10, this will give us the same AIC as when the ratio for is 100:1. The latter ratio is highly skewed and might not sufficiently represent the handwriting style of that writer. This is also the drawback of the AIC presented in this paper. Thus, it will be of interest to take into consideration the distributions of both the reference and the test document when computing AIC. One such possible evolution would be to consider two independent sigmoid functions. This will allow us to control the saturation region of the AIC for each reference and test writer independently.
