 Discovering temporal patterns from event se quences has received considerable atten-relations between sequences and subsequences of events widely appearing in a variety of knowledge discovery applications, such as biology, medicine, business, finance, etc [5]. The existing researches, however, mostly focus on mining frequent subsequences from serial event sequences with two major defects[6,7,8,11]. (1) Only serial se-quences are considered, though the parallel sequences are more common in practice. different types could happen at an instant in parallel sequences. (2) Little attention is paid to the intervening phenomenon between different event types. Frequent event intervention imposed on one type of events by another. For example, in Birth Defect monitoring, we are interested in which kind of event types are more effective to inter-vene the occurrences of the birth defects. widely in parallel event sequences. Our idea is illustrated in the following example. rences of events of type Y in next period, and not the other way inverse. X is referred Section 4. 
The next problem is how to evaluate the effect of intervention. This study assumes intervention can be regarded as the deviation from generalized Markov property on that of X ( t ) in the previous period. Consequently, we suggest a measure, Interven-measure the distance between two distributions. Kullback-Leibler divergence is asym-metric and is suitable to resist noise. The intervention intensity could be computed by appropriately conditioned transition probabilities. These probabilities can be approxi-mated by kernel estimation from data. More details are described in Section 5. 
Integrating above ideas, we implement an algorithm called MIPES to Mine the In-terventions from a given Parallel Event Sequence. MIPES is with time complexity of events and will not degrade the scalability of MIPES. works. Section 3 gives concise descriptio n of Markov Chain and Kullback-leibler divergence. Section 4 formulates the problem and describes the intervention in details. of MIPES. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MIPES through experiments in section 8 and present the conclusions in section 9. The first popular task of mining from temporal data is mining associate rule [6,10,11], whose common approach is based on the apriority method [10]. When a transactional database is represented as a set of sequences of transactions performed by one entity most important modification is on the notion of support: support is now the fraction of i.e. an entity could only contribute one time to increment the support of each itemset, beside it could had consumed that itemset several times. 
Another important temporal pattern is episode, which is essentially small, partially ordered collections of event types [7]. An episode is considered interesting if it occurs sequences was introduced by Mannila, et al [7]. They define the frequency of an epi-extensions to this windows-based frequency have also been proposed[12,13]. S. Lax-man, et al, have proposed a new notion for episode frequency based on the non-overlapped occurrences of an episode in the given event sequences[8]. merge operator[14]. This operator receives two sequences and returns  X  X  sequence whose shape is a compromise between the two original sequences X  X 14]. The basic building a more general model for the class. Since traditional classification algorithms are difficult to apply to sequential examples, mostly because there is a vast number of consists on applying a preprocessing mechanism to extract relevant features. One use hierarchical clustering method to cluster temporal sequences data[16]. 
The existing work did nothing with the intervention phenomenons in parallel event tions, which is discussed in detail in the rest of this paper. For the sake of completeness, we begin with an overview of Markov chain and Kullback-Leibler divergence. 
A Markov chain is a sequence of random variables X 1 , X 2 , X 3 , ... with the Markov property, Define the probability of going from state i to state j in n time steps as and the single step transition as The n -step transition satisfies the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, that for any k such that 0 &lt; k &lt; n , distributions P and Q . Kullback-Leibler divergence measures the expected difference in the number of bits required to code samples from P when using a code based on P , typically represents a theory, model, description, or approximation of P . For probabi-divergence of P from Q is defined as noise. quences. Given a set E of event types, a single type event sequence is X ( t ) where X  X  only the discrete timelines in which occurrence times of events are positive integers. Assuming that the event sequences under study can be approximated by Markov property holds for all i . Based on this idea, the intervention can be defined as the following. probability function. X is referred as to the intervention source of Y, and Y is referred as to the intervention target of X. By definition 1, X  X  Y holds if the frequency distribution of Y in next period depends occurrences of Y in next period. Proposition 1. The relation of X  X  Y is reflexive, antisymmetrical, and transitive. Proof . The reflexivity and transitivity are obvious, hence we only prove the antisymmetry by contradiction. Suppose Y  X  X holds, by Definition 1 holds, which implies that x i +1 depends on y i . Since implies y i depends on x i Thus interventions are partial ordering relations on different types of events. Based on the concept of intervention, the intervention chain is defined as follows. Definition 2. A N-order intervention chain is a partially ordered set V of event types and has form: V  X  X 1  X  X 2  X  ...  X  X N . As the consequence of Proposition 1, it is easy to prove the Proposition 2.  X  ...  X  X N can be composed to a N-order intervention chain X 1  X  X 2  X  ...  X  X n . this study only focuses the algorithm on the discovery of 2-order intervention chains. scenarios, then the noisy ones. 5.1 The Noise-Free Scenarios of this deviation can be measured by Kullb ack-Leibler divergence[9], which results to definition of intervention intensity. intensity of X  X  Y is defined as Intuitively, the intervention intensity indicates the excess amount of bits that must be used to encode the information of the state of the process by erroneously assum-a resolution r , P ( y i +1 , y i , x i ) can be obtained by by and P ( y i ). 
It follows from the nonsymmetry of Kullback-Leibler divergence that the non-symmetry of I ( X  X  Y ), which reflects the fact that information flow between two event sequences is directional. not influence Y ( t ). It is consistent with the Markov property and shows the definition of intervention intensity is reasonable. 5.2 The Noisy Scenarios So far, only the noise-free cases are considered in which if X  X  Y holds then I (Y  X  X) however, we can not assure I (Y  X  X) is zero even if X  X  Y holds. as it follows from the nonsymmetry of Kullback-Leibler divergence[9]. Proposition 3. I(X  X  Y)  X  I(Y  X  X).
 stated in proposition 1. We can understand the intervention from the perspective of entropy rate. As stated in The entropy rate of stochastic process Y ( t ) is defined as and if Y ( t ) is a Markov chain, then where H ( X ) is entropy. h Proof . By definition 1 and the relation between the joint and conditional probabilities, we can obtain: Note the following two remarks on proposition 4: (1) As a Markov chain, the uncertainty, namely the entropy, of one event imposed on Y ( t ) by X ( t ) leads to the reduction of entropy rate of Y ( t ). rithm called MIPES to Mine Interventions from Parallel Event Sequences. The outline of MIPES is shown as follows. 1. k  X  ( T e  X  T e )  X  w ; 2. foreach X ( t ) in { X 1 ( t ), ..., X m ( t )} do begin 3. count the x i , 1  X  i  X  k ; 4. end for ; 5. Generate candidates set C  X  {( X p ( t ), X q ( t )): 1  X  p  X  q  X  m }; 6. foreach ( X p ( t ), X q ( t ))  X  C do begin 8. if I ( X p  X  X q )  X  I ( X q  X  X p ) then do begin 9. add { I ( X p  X  X q )} to R ; 10. else 11. add { I ( X q  X  X p )} to R ; 12. end if ; 13. end for ; 14. end tensity between every two single type event sequences (Line 7). Since the number of practice when the number of event types is small. In this section, we apply MIPES to dataset CalIT2 downloaded from UCI[18] to vali-count data of two event types, In-event and Out-event, recorded every 30 minutes at the front door of the Calit2 institute building on the UC Irvine campus. 
The first experiment investigates how the resolution r in equation (3), (4), (5), (6) impacts the evaluation of intervention intensity. Without loss of generality, we use the are shown in Fig.2, and the results are depicted in Fig.3. 
A few observations on Fig.3 are as follows. (1) The data have noise, and consequently both I (In-event  X  Out-event) and (2) In-event  X  Out-event can be confirmed because I (In-event  X  Out-event)  X  (3) Along with r increasing, I (In-event  X  Out-event) and I (Out-event  X  In-event) (4) Nevertheless, excessively small r will limit the amount of available data for The second experiment examines the performance of MIPES over different scales of quently, MIPES will not sharp decline in performance in practice even though the size of data increases remarkable. In this paper we have studied the intervening phenomenons appearing widely in parallel event sequences. The main contributions include: intervention is a deviation from generalized Markov property and is equivalent to the ordering relation. (2) We defined Intervention Intensity based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure the effect of intervention imposed on one type of events by another. We also proved an important property of the intervention intensity, nonsymmetry. (3) We proposed algorithm MIPES by integrating the above ideas. We have tion results shows that MIPES is funtionable and scalable. the whole data of event sequences have been observed. Hence, it is an important fu-mining interventions in streaming fashion from time evolving event sequences.
