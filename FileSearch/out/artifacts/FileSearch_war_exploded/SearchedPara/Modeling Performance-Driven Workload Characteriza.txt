Previous work on workload characterization for Web search systems mainly focuses on the characterization of user search behavior [4, 7]. In this paper, however, we model workloads for a Web search engine from a system performance point of view, analyzing both the distribution of the interarrival times of queries and the per-query execution time. This is crucial for performance evaluation and capacity planning purposes. Our results are derived from experiments in an information retrieval testbed fed with a log of a real-world search engine. Previous analytical models for search systems considered that interarrival times and service times are ex-ponentially distributed [6]. In contrast, we verify in practice that there is a high variability in both interarrival times of queries reaching a search engine and service times of queries processed in parallel by a cluster of index servers. We also show that this highly variable behavior of interarrival times and service times is very well captured by hyperexponential distributions.
Search engines typically adopt a computational cluster as a platform for parallel query processing [5]. Usually, this cluster is composed of a single broker and a set of index servers. The whole collection of documents is partitioned among the index servers, such that each server stores its own local subcollection [2]. We assign each document to an index server randomly, a policy that works fine in balancing stor-age space utilization among servers [3]. The broker accepts queries from a user and forwards them to the index servers, triggering the parallel query processing. Each index server that the maximum ordinate difference between the distribu-tion of interarrival times and the fitted exponential distri-bution is 15 . 40%, while this difference for the fitted hyper-exponential distribution with 3 phases is only 1 . 37%.
We also found evidence that interarrival times presents self-similarity and long-range dependence (LRD) [8]. LRD characterizes processes that keep statistically significant cor-relations across large time scales, while a process is said to be self-similar if its behavior is roughly the same across dif-ferent spatial or time scales. The Hurst parameter H in the range 0 . 5 &lt;H&lt; 1 is a measure of the level of self-similarity of a time series that exhibits LRD. A value of 0 . 5 indicates the absence of self-similarity. The closer H is to 1, the greater the degree of LRD. In our experimental data, interarrival times of queries presented H =0 . 88.
Second, we characterize the distribution of service times of queries processed in parallel by the cluster of index servers. In our architecture, characterized by a local partitioning of the document collection, the per-query service time is deter-mined by the maximum execution time among index servers participating in the parallel processing of this particular query. Our experimental results show that the coefficient of variation of the service times of queries in our cluster with 8 index servers is equal to 1 . 39. This high variabil-ity in service times of queries is mainly due to the presence of a certain level of imbalance in per-query execution times among homogeneous index servers participating in the par-allel processing. The primary source of the per-query im-balance is the heterogeneous use of disk caching among the homogeneous index servers, as pointed out in [1]. Thus, the coefficient of variation indicates the hyperexponential distri-bution as an appropriate kind of distribution for fitting the service times of queries.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of service times of queries fitted using an hyperexponential distribution composed of 3 exponential phases. Similarly to the case of interarrival times, we observe that the fitting provided by the hyperex-ponential distribution with 3 phases is very accurate. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test verifies that the maximum ordinate difference between the distribution of service times and the fitted hyperexponential distribution with 3 phases is only 2 . 29%, while this difference for the fitted exponential distribution is equal to 20 . 43%.
Likewise the distribution of interarrival times, the distri-bution of per-query service times also presents self-similarity and LRD characteristics. In the case of the considered dis-
