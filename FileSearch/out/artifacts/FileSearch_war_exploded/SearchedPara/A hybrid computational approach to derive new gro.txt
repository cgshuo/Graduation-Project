 1. Introduction and background
Seismic hazard analysis is one of the fundamental steps in engineering phase. The seismological characteristics of earth-quakes commonly include magnitude, distance, faulting type, and soil effects. The engineering parameters of an earthquake can be divided into two main classes: (1) time-domain para-meters and (2) response-domain parameters. Peak ground accel-eration (PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV) and peak ground displacement (PGD) are the major time-domain class parameters. In the response domain, pseudo spectral acceleration (PSA) is the well-known parameter. Both classes of the time-and response-domain parameters can be applied to the risk assessment of structures. It has been demonstrated that the spectral parameters are more efficient than the time-domain parameters ( Luco and Cornell, 2007 ). On the other hand, application of the time-domain parameters is more convenient due to their independency from the considered structures. Thus, PGA, PGV and PGD are commonly used in the seismic hazard studies. Various methods may be employed to estimate these elements such as on-site investiga-tion and physical modeling. Implementing these methods is usually extensive, cumbersome and costly ( G  X  ull  X  u and Erc 2007 ). Much effort is often made to describe limited observations through the physical modeling of the earthquake process. In this approach, the observations are used for the calibration of the physical model. Such models are usually developed in the context of stochastic modeling approach and random vibration theory (see e.g., Papageorgiou and Aki, 1983 ). More advanced physical models try to model the realistic process of faulting through the numerical modeling of crack and wave propagation (e.g., Krishnan et al., 2006 ).

Ground-motion prediction equat ions (GMPEs) play a critical role in the seismic hazard analysis. The GMPEs relate the ground-motion parameters to various independent variables such as earthquake magnitude, distance from source to site, local site conditions, earthquake source characteristics, and wave propagation ( Kramer, parameters such as stress drop, rup ture propagation, directivity, basin effects, and nonlinear soil behavior are not generally used in the predictive models ( Somerville and Graves, 2003 ).

A conventional way to construct the GMPEs from the recorded and Bozorgnia, 2007 ). In each form, a simple statistical model may be developed to describe the tendency of the ground-motion parameters with other parameters at the station. In addition to the physical aspects ( Douglas, 2003, 2004; G  X  ull  X  uandErc the capabilities of the regression-based GMPEs. Most commonly used regression analyses can have la rge uncertainties. It has major drawbacks for idealization of com plex processes, approximation, and averaging widely varying prototype conditions. Another impor-tant issue is due to the limitation of this method. The regression analysis tries to model the nature of the corresponding problem by a pre-defined linear or nonlinear equation ( Gandomi et al., 2010a ). the assumption of normality of re siduals. Thus, the developed attenuation models are often limited in their ability to reliably simulate the complex behavior of the ground-motion parameters necessity of employing more comprehensive methods to decrease errors for the ground-motion parameters estimates.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are the well-known pattern recognition methods. Recently, considerable researches have been carried out to estimate the strong-motion characteristics via
ANNs. Kerh and Chu (2002) employed ANNs to estimate PGA at two main line sections of Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit in
Taiwan. They also compared the ANN-based results with those of available empirical formulas in the literature. Chu et al. (2003) developed a neural network model by employing historical seismic records to analyze the strong-motion characteristics around the Kaohsiung area of Taiwan. Kerh and Ting (2005) used back-propagation neural networks to predict PGA along the high-
Gunayd X n and Gunayd X n (2008) developed PGA prediction models using ANNs based on the strong-motion data from Turkey.
However, ANNs are not usually able to produce practical predic-tion equations. Moreover, they require the structure of the net-work to be identified a priori. The ANN method is mostly appropriate to be used as a part of a computer program.
Genetic programming (GP) ( Koza, 1992 ) is a new approach with completely new characteristics and traits. GP is an extension of genetic algorithms. It may generally be defined as a supervised machine learning technique that searches a program space instead of a data space. The programs generated by GP are represented as tree structures and expressed in the functional programming language ( Koza, 1992 ). The main advantage of the
GP-based approaches over the regression and ANN techniques is their ability to generate prediction equations without assuming prior form of the relationship. The developed equations can be easily manipulated in practical circumstances ( Gandomi et al., 2010a, 2011 ). Many researchers have employed GP and its variants to find out any complex relationships among the experi-mental data (e.g., Johari et al., 2006; Gandomi et al., 2010a,b, 2011; Alavi et al., 2010; Alavi and Gandomi, 2010 ). Some of the the ground-motion parameters include prediction of PGA using the strong ground-motion data from Turkey ( Cabalar and Cevik, 2009 ), and developing new predictive equations for the ratio of PGV to PGA ( Kermani et al., 2009 ).

Orthogonal least squares (OLS) algorithm ( Billings et al., 1988 ) is an effective algorithm to determine which terms are significant in a linear-in-parameters model. The OLS algorithm introduces the error reduction ratio, which is a measure of the decrease in the variance of output by a given term. Mada  X  r et al. (2005) combined GP and OLS to make a hybrid algorithm with better efficiency. It was shown that introducing this strategy into the GP process results in more robust and interpretable models. Some of the limited researches with the specific objective of applying the
GP/OLS method to civil engineering problems have recently conducted by Gandomi and Alavi (in press) and Gandomi et al. (2010a) .

In this paper, the hybrid GP/OLS technique is utilized to derive new linear-in-parameters GMPEs. GP/OLS is useful in deriving prediction equations for PGA, PGV and PGD by directly extracting the knowledge contained in the experimental data. The predictor variables included in the analysis were earthquake magnitude, earthquake source to site distance, average shear-wave velocity, and types of faulting mechanisms (strike-slip, normal, and reverse). The performance of the developed GMPEs were com-pared with that of the previously published empirical models (e,g., Sadigh and Egan, 1998; Nowroozi, 2005; Campbell and
Bozorgnia, 2007; Rajabi et al., 2010 ). The GMPEs were developed based on a comprehensive database of the strong ground-motions assembled by PEER ( Power et al., 2006 ). 2. Genetic programming
GP is a modern regression technique with a great ability to automatically evolve computer programs. The evolutionary pro-cess followed by the GP algorithm is inspired from the principle of
Darwinian natural selection. GP was introduced by Koza (1992) after experiments on symbolic regression. This classical GP technique is also called tree-based GP ( Koza, 1992 ; Alavi et al., 2011 ). The main difference between the GA and GP approaches is that in GP the evolving programs (individuals) are parse trees rather than fixed-length binary strings. The traditional optimiza-tion techniques, like GA, are generally used in parameter optimi-zation to evolve the best values for a given set of model parameters. GP, on the other hand, gives the basic structure of the approximation model together with the values of its para-meters. GP optimizes a population of computer programs accord-ing to a fitness landscape determined by a program ability to perform a given computational task. GP is relatively a new field of pattern recognition methods in contrast with GA. A survey of the literature reveals the growing interest of the research community in GP ( Alavi et al., 2011 ).

In GP, a random population of individuals (trees) is created to achieve high diversity. The symbolic optimization algorithms pre-sent the potential solutions by structural ordering of several symbols (Gandomi et al., 2010a). A population member in GP is a hierarchically structured tree comprising functions and terminals.
The functions and terminals are selected from a set of functions and a set of terminals. For example, the function set F can contain the basic arithmetic operations (+, , , /, etc.), Boolean logic func-tions (AND, OR, NOT, etc.), or any other mathematical functions. The terminal set T contains the arguments for the functions and can functions and terminals are chosen at random and constructed together to form a computer model in a tree-like structure with a root point with branches extending from each function and ending in a terminal. An example of a simple tree representation of a GP model is illustrated in Fig. 1 ( Gandomi et al., 2010a ).
The creation of the initial population is a blind random search for solutions in the large space of possible solutions. Once a population of models has been created at random, the GP algorithm evaluates the individuals, selects individuals for repro-duction, generates new individuals by mutation, crossover, and direct reproduction, and finally creates the new generation in all iterations ( Koza, 1992; Gandomi et al., 2010a ). During the cross-over procedure, a point on a branch of each solution (program) is selected at random and the set of terminals and/or functions from each program are then swapped to create two new programs as can be seen in Fig. 2 (Gandomi et al., 2010a). The evolutionary process continues by evaluating the fitness of the new population and starting a new round of reproduction and crossover. During this process, the GP algorithm occasionally selects a function or terminal from a model at random and mutates it (see Fig. 3 ). The best program that appeared in any generation, the best-so-far solution, defines the output of the GP algorithm ( Koza, 1992 ). In the following subsections, the coupled algorithm of GP and OLS, GP/OLS, is briefly described. 2.1. Genetic programming for linear-in-parameters models
In general, GP creates not only nonlinear models but also linear-in-parameters models. In order to avoid parameter models, the parameters must be removed from the set of terminals. That denotes the i th repressor variable. Hence, a population member represents only F i nonlinear functions ( Pearson, 2003 ). The para-meters are assigned to the model after  X  X  X xtracting X  X  the F terms from the tree, and determined using a least squares (LS) algorithm ( Reeves, 1997 ). A simple technique for the decomposi-tion of the tree into function terms can be used. The sub-trees, representing the F i function terms, are determined by decompos-ing the tree starting from the root as far as reaching nonlinear nodes (nodes which are not  X  X + X  X  or  X  X   X  X ). As can be seen in Fig. 4 it is possible to decompose the tree into two sub-trees of  X  X  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  X  X . The root node of the  X  X  X  X  X  tree is again a linear operator; therefore, it can be decomposed into  X  X  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  X  X  trees. As the root node of the  X  X  X  X  X  tree is a nonlinear node (/), it cannot be decomposed. The root nodes of  X  X  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  X  X  trees are also non-linear. Consequently, the final decomposition procedure results in decomposition, it is possible to assign parameters to the func-tional terms represented by the obtained sub-trees. The resulted linear-in-parameters model for this example is y : p 0 + p x + p 2 x 0 + p 3 x 1 ( Gandomi et al., 2010a ).

GP can be used for selecting from special model classes, such as a polynomial model. To achieve it, the set of operators must be restricted and some simple syntactic rules must be introduced. For instance, if the set of operators is defined as F  X  { , +} and there is a syntactic rule that exchanges the internal nodes that are below a  X  X   X  X -type internal nodes to  X  X   X  X -type nodes, GP will generate only polynomial models ( Mada  X  r et al., 2004, 2005; Gandomi et al., 2010a ). 2.2. Orthogonal least squares algorithm
The great advantage of using linear-in-parameter models is that the LS method can be used for identifying the model parameters. This is much less computationally demanding than other nonlinear optimization algorithms, because the optimal p  X  X  U 1 U  X  T U y  X  1  X  the U regression matrix is U  X  for determining which terms are significant in a linear-in-para-meters model. The OLS technique introduces the error reduction ratio (err), which is a measure of the decrease in the variance of output by a given term. The matrix form corresponding to the linear-in-parameters model is y  X  U p  X  e  X  3  X  where the U is the regression matrix, p is the parameter vector, and e is the error vector. The OLS method transforms the columns of the
U matrix into a set of orthogonal basis vectors to inspect the individual contributions of each term ( Cao et al., 1999; Gandomi matrix U can be orthogonally decomposed as U  X  WA ,where A is an
M M uppertriangularmatrix(i.e., A ij  X  0if i 4 j ). W is an N M matrix with orthogonal columns in the sense that WTW  X  D is a vector g can be calculate as g  X  D 1 W T y  X  4  X  where g i represents the corresponding element of the OLS solution vector. The output variance ( y T y )/ N can be described as y y  X 
Therefore, the error reduction ratio [err] i of the U i term can be expressed as  X  err i  X 
This ratio offers a simple mean for order and selects the model terms of a linear-in-parameters model on the basis of their contribution to the performance of the model. 2.3. Hybrid genetic programming-orthogonal least squares algorithm (GP/OLS)
The application of OLS to the GP algorithm leads to significant improvements in the performance of GP. The main feature of this hybrid approach is to transform the trees to simpler trees which are more transparent, but their accuracies are close to the original trees ( Gandomi et al., 2010a ). In this coupled algorithm, GP generates a lot of potential solutions in the form of a tree structure during the GP operation. These trees may have better and worse terms (sub-trees) that contribute more or less to the accuracy of the model represented by the tree. OLS is used to estimate the contribution of the branches of the tree to the accuracy of the model, whereas, using the OLS, one can select the less significant terms in a linear regression problem.
According to this strategy, terms (sub-trees) having the smallest
This  X  X  X ree pruning X  X  approach is realized in every fitness evalua-
GP works with the tree structure, the further goal is to preserve method always guarantees that the elimination of one or more function terms of the model can be done by pruning the corresponding sub-trees, so there is no need for structural rearrangement of the tree after this operation. The way the GP/OLS method works on its basis is simply demonstrated in
Fig. 5 (Gandomi et al., 2010a). Assume that the function which must be identified is y ( x )  X  0.8( u x 1 ) 2 +1.2 y x 1 can be seen in Fig. 5 , the GP algorithm finds a solution with four rithm, the sub-tree with the least error reduction ratio ( F  X  u x 1 u x 2 ) is eliminated from the tree. Subsequently, the error reduction ratios and mean square error values (and model parameters) are calculated again. The new model (after pruning) may have a higher mean square error but it obviously has a more adequate structure ( Gandomi et al., 2010a ). 3. Modeling of time-domain strong ground-motion characteristics
The damage potential of earthquakes is dependent on the ground-motion characteristics and local site condition. Ampli-tude, frequency content and duration of motion are the significant characteristics of earthquake motion ( Kramer, 1996 ). The ground-motion parameters have essential roles in explaining the char-acteristics of strong ground-motions. PGA, PGV and PGD are the commonly used time-domain parameters of ground-motions.
These parameters are frequently presented in quantitative forms as functions of different seismic variables. The most significant seismological aspects that influence the ground-motion para-meters are the source effect, path effect and site effect. The source effect is related to numerous parameters such as the level of stress drop in the earthquake event, mechanism of faulting, and direction of faulting. The influence of these parameters is not similar and strongly depends on the distance of the desired site from the fault. Especially, for relatively distant sites, it is not needed to consider the complex form of the faulting procedure (e.g., the hanging-wall effect). The path effect is related to the distance of the site from the fault. Different definitions are proposed for the distance in the literature (e.g., closest distance, Joyner X  X oore distance, etc.) in different GMPEs ( Boore and relations as a significant element. Some of the models consider the site effect in a generic way (i.e., soil or rock) and the others uses the soil shear velocity as an indicator of the site effects.
However, the modern GMPEs are mainly in terms of the earth-quake magnitude, source to site distance, geotechnical condition of site, and faulting mechanism (e.g., Boore et al., 1997; Boore and
Atkinson, 2007; Campbell and Bozorgnia, 2007 ). Other affecting physical parameters such as stress drop, rupture propagation, directivity, and nonlinear soil behavior significantly reflect the uncertainties and therefore, they are not generally considered in the development of the predictive equations ( Somerville and Graves, 2003; Cabalar and Cevik, 2009 ).
 u
To enhance the precision of the conventional regression-based analyses, several novel methods have recently been employed. The main purpose of this study is to derive alternative prediction equations for PGA, PGV and PGD using the GP/OLS approach. The most important factors representing the ground-motion para-meters behavior were selected based on the literature review (e.g., Douglas, 2003; Ambraseys et al., 1996; Boore et al., 1997 ; and Erc -elebi, 2007; Boore and Atkinson, 2008; Cabalar and Cevik, 2009; Kermani et al., 2009; Rajabi et al., 2010 ). Consequently, the formulations of PGA (cm/s 2 ), PGV (cm/s) and PGD (cm) were considered to be as follows: ln  X  PGA  X  , ln  X  PGV  X  , ln  X  PGD  X  X  f  X  M w , ln  X  R jb where M w is the earthquake magnitude (moment magnitude); R (km) is the closest distance to the surface projection of the fault plane (Joyner X  X oore distance). R jb is approximately equal to the epicentral distance for events of M w o 6( Boore and Atkinson, 2007 ); V s30 (m/s) is the average shear-wave velocity over the top 30 m of site F is the coefficient representing different fault types: Reverse (dip slip with hanging-wall side up).
 Normal (dip slip with hanging-wall side down).
 Strike-slip (horizontal slip).

The significant influence of the above predictor variables in determining PGA, PGV and PGD is well understood. Indicator variables representing the style of faulting are defined in terms of rake angle. The rake angle is described as the average angle of slip in degrees measured in the plane of rupture between the strike direction and the slip vector ( Campbell and Bozorgnia, 2007 ). Majority of the existing GMPEs introduce empirically derived the faulting mechanism categories in the model development (see Douglas, 2004; Campbell and Bozorgnia, 2007 ). A similar procedure is followed in this study. PGA, PGV and PGD were first empirical coefficients for different faulting mechanisms were obtained using GAs. 3.1. Strong-motion database and data preprocessing
Source of the strong ground-motion data employed for the developing the GMPEs was the database compiled in the PEER-NGA project by Power et al. (2006) (NGA Flatfile V 7.3). The database is comprised of shallow crustal earthquakes recorded data at active tectonic regions of the world. The database covers a broad range of magnitude and distance. It is optional for researchers to use the entire database or to limit their analyses to selected subsets. In this study, a part of the database was excluded from the analysis considering some of the filtering strategies presented by Boore and Atkinson (2007) . Data sets missing the required information and also the duplicate records were excluded from the analysis. Finally, out of the total of 3551 records, 2777 records for reverse (dip slip with hanging-wall side up), normal (dip slip with hanging-wall side down), and strike-slip (horizontal slip) fault types were employed for the model development. The predictor variables included in the analysis were M w , R jb (km), V s30 (m/s), and F . PGA, PGV and PGD were the ground-motion parameters to be formulated. Fig. 6 shows the distribution of the data used to develop the predictive equations. For more visualization, the data are presented by frequency histograms ( Fig. 7 ). The ranges and statistics of different para-meters involved in the modeling process are given in Table 1 .As can be seen in this table, the ranges of the predictor variables is relatively wide, particularly for magnitude and distance. The wideness of the ranges has an important role in the GP-based seismic hazard analysis.

For the GP/OLS analyses, the data sets were randomly divided into training (learning and validation) and testing subsets. The learning data were taken for the training of the algorithm (genetic evolution). The validation data were used to specify the general-ization capability of the models on data they did not train on (model selection). Thus, both of the learning and validation data were involved in the modeling process and were categorized into testing data were finally employed to measure the performance of the models obtained by GP/OLS on the data that played no role in building the models. In order to obtain a consistent data division, several combinations of the training and testing sets were considered. The selection was such that the maximum, minimum, mean and standard deviation of parameters were consistent in the training and testing data sets. Of the 2777 data, 2361 data were used for the training process (1945 for learning data and 416 for validation) and 416 data sets were taken for the testing of the generalization capability of the models. 3.2. Performance measures
The best GMPEs were chosen on the basis of a multi-objective strategy as below (i) The simplicity of the model, although this was not a pre-(ii) Providing the best fitness value on a learning set of data. (iii) Providing the best fitness value on a validation set of data.
The first objective can be controlled by the user through the parameter settings (e.g., maximum program depth). For the other objectives, the following objective function (OBJ) was constructed as a measure of how well the model predicted output agrees with the measured output. The selections of the best models were deduced by the minimization of the following function: number of learning, validation and training data; R , RMSE and
MAE are, respectively, correlation coefficient, root mean squared error and mean absolute error given in the form of formulas as follows: R  X  RMSE  X  MAE  X  1 n in which h i and t i are, respectively, the actual and predicted output values for the i th output, h i is the average of the actual outputs, and n is the number of sample. It is well-known that the R value alone is not a good indicator of prediction accuracy of a model. This is because that by shifting the output values of a model equally, the R value will not change. The constructed objective function takes into account the changes of R , RMSE and MAE together. Higher R values and lower RMSE and MAE values result in lower OBJ and, consequently, indicate a more precise model. In addition, the above function considers the effects of different data divisions for the learning and validation data. 3.3. Model development using GP/OLS
The available database was used for generating the PGA, PGV and PGD prediction equations. Various parameters are involved in the GP/OLS predictive algorithm. The parameter selection signifi-cantly affects the generalization capability of the derived GP/OLS-based GMPEs. The parameter settings for the GP/OLS algorithm are shown in Table 2 . In order to obtain simple and straightfor-ward formulas, four basic arithmetic operators (+, , , /) were utilized in the analysis. The number of programs in the population that GP/OLS will evolve is set by the population size. A run will take longer with a larger population size. The number of genera-tion sets the number of levels the algorithm will use before the run terminates. The proper numbers of population and generation depend on the complexity of the problem. In this study, a fairly large number of initial population and generations were tested to find models with minimum error. The program was run until the runs terminated automatically. Mutation and crossover rate are the probabilities that an offspring will be subject to the mutation and crossover operations. The values of both of these parameters for the optimal models were 50%. The maximum tree depth directly influences the size of the search space and the number of solutions explored within the search space. The success of the GP/OLS algorithm usually increases with increasing these para-meters. In this case, the complexity of the evolved function increases and the speed of the algorithm decreases. The max-imum tree depth was set to an optimal value of 12 as a tradeoff between the running time and the complexity of the evolved solutions. The other involved parameters values were selected based on some previously suggested values ( Gandomi et al., 2010a; Gandomi and Alavi, 2010; Mada  X  r et al., 2004 ) and also after a trial and error approach. 3.3.1. GP/OLS-based ground-motion prediction equations
The peak ground acceleration (PGA), velocity (PGV) and dis-placement (PGD) prediction equations, for the best results by the
GP/OLS algorithm, are as given below ln  X  PGA  X  X  cm = s 2  X  X  7 : 673 1 : 28  X  ln  X  V s30  X   X  ln  X  R ln  X  PGV  X  X  cm = s  X  X  3 : 37  X  1 : 059 M w 0 : 02  X  ln  X  R ln  X  PGD  X  X  cm  X  X  1 : 973  X  1 : 917 M w  X  7 : 82 ln  X  R jb tude, earthquake source to site distance, and average shear-wave different fault types. These coefficients are presented in Table 3 .
Comparisons of the measured and predicted PGA, PGV and PGD values are, respectively, shown in Figs. 8 X 10 .
 4. Performance analysis and model validity Based on a logical hypothesis ( Smith, 1986 ), if a model gives
R 4 0.8, and the error values (e.g., RMSE and MAE) are at the minimum, there is a strong correlation between the predicted and measured values. The model can therefore be judged as very good.
It can be observed from Figs. 8 X 10 that the GP/OLS models with high R and low RMSE and MAE values are able to predict the target values to an acceptable degree of accuracy. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that the RMSE and MAE values are not only low but also as similar as possible for the training and testing sets. This suggests that the proposed models have both predictive ability (low values) and generalization performance (similar values) ( Pan et al., 2009 ).

It is known that the models derived using the ANNs, GP, or other soft computing tools, in most cases, have a predictive capability within the data range used for their development. This is because of the nature of these techniques which distinguishes them from the other conventional techniques. Thus, the amount of data used for the modeling process is an important issue, as it bears heavily on the reliability of the final models. To cope with this limitation, Frank and Todeschini (1994) argue that the minimum ratio of the number of objects over the number of selected variables for model acceptability is 3. They also suggest that considering a higher ratio equal to 5 would be safer. In the present study, this ratio is much higher and is equal to 2777/3  X  925.7. The PGD prediction results are slightly better than those of PGA and PGV. Furthermore, new criteria recom-mended by Golbraikh and Tropsha (2002) were checked for the external validation of the models on the test data sets. It is suggested that at least one slope of regression lines ( k or k 0 ) through the origin should be close to 1. Also, the performance indexes of m and n should be lower than 0.1. Either the squared correlation coefficient (through the origin) between predicted and
The considered validation criteria and the relevant results obtained by the models are presented in Table 4 . As it is seen, the proposed models satisfy the required conditions. This con-firms that the derived GMPEs are strongly valid, have the predic-tion power and are not chance correlations. 5. Sensitivity and parametric analyses
Sensitivity analysis is of utmost concern for selecting the important input variables. The contribution of each predictor variable in the GP/OLS-based GMPEs was evaluated through a sensitivity analysis. For this aim, frequency values of the input variables were obtained. A frequency value equal to 1.00 for an input indicates that this variable has been appeared in 100% of the best thirty programs evolved by GP/OLS. This methodology is a common approach in the GP-based analyses ( Gandomi et al., 2010a, 2011 ). The frequency values of the predictor variables are presented in Fig. 11 . According to these results, it can be found that the ground-motion parameters are more sensitive to M followed by R jb and V s30 . These are expected cases and go arm in arm with the ground-motions behavior.

A parametric analysis was also performed in this study to verify the robustness of the GP/OLS prediction equations. The parametric analysis investigates the response of the predicted ground-motion parameters from the GMPEs to a set of hypothe-tical input data. The methodology is based on the change of only one predictor variable at a time while the other seismic variables are kept constant at the average values of their entire data sets. A set of synthetic data for the single varied parameter is generated by increasing the value of this in increments. These variables are presented to the prediction equations and PGA, PGV and PGD are calculated. This procedure is repeated using another variable until the model response is tested for all input variables. The robust-ness of the design equations is determined by examining how well the predicted PGA, PGV and PGD values agree with the underlying physical behavior of the investigated system ( Kuo
PGA, PGV and PGD predictions to the variations of the seismic parameters, M w , R jb , and V s30 . The results of the parametric analysis indicate that PGA, PGV and PGD continuously increase due to increasing M w and decrease with increasing R jb and V
The parametric analysis results are soundly expected cases from a seismological viewpoint ( Ambraseys et al., 1996; Boore et al., 1997 ; Boore and Atkinson, 2007 ; Campbell and Bozorgnia, 2007 ). The above results confirm that the proposed design equations are robust and can confidently be used for predictive purposes in seismic hazard studies. 6. Comparison of the ground-motion prediction equations
A comparison of the GP/OLS-bas ed GMPEs developed in this study with all of the existing ground-motion models is beyond the scope of this study. The results obtained in this research are compared with those provided by the well-known models of Sadigh and Egan (1998) Frequency for the prediction of PGA, PGV and PGD. As a part of the PEER Next
Generation Attenuation of Ground Motion (NGA) Project, Campbell and Bozorgnia (2007) and Boore and Atkinson (2008) developed updated prediction equations fo r PGA, PGV and PGD. The results of these recent researches have also been included in the comparative study. It is notable that the Boore and Atkinson X  X  models were established for the PGA and PGV prediction. The performance of the models was evaluated on a well-known database provided by Haselton and Deierlein (2007) . The database contains 78 records is focused on developing a procedure to validate seismic provisions for structural design. The performance statistics of the PGA,
PGV and PGD prediction models are visualized in Figs. 15 X 17 .As can be observed from Fig. 15 , the proposed prediction equation for

As shown in Fig. 17 , the performance of the proposed PGD prediction equation (RMSE  X  0.696, MAE  X  0.570) is considerably better than the NGA X  X  GMPEs and Sadigh and Egan X  X  model.

Despite the good performance the NGA models, they are complicated equations with long linear or nonlinear terms. These models include several predictor (independent) variables. The involved variables are moment magnitude, one or more of the fault distance measures, indicator variables for style of faulting, hanging-wall parameters, shear-wave velocity, one or more of the sediment depth parameters, and the depth to the top of coseismic rupture. On the other hand, the high-precision GMPEs obtained by means of GP/OLS are significantly short and straightforward. This is mainly because of the important role of the tree pruning process in the GP/OLS algorithm. Note that the GP/OLS equations are developed using only four predictor variables ( M w , R and F ) and therefore they can easily be used via hand calculations. As more data become available, including those for other main-shocks or up-to-date NGA strong-motion data, these GMPEs can be improved to make more accurate predictions for a wider range. Also, the user physical insight and the shape of the classical GMPEs can be regarded in making propositions on the elements and structure of the evolved functions.

Most of the existing GMPEs are derived by performing the multiple regression analysis (e.g., the NGA models). The signifi-cant limitations of the conventional regression analysis have previously described. Such models often assume linear, or in some cases nonlinear, relationships between the ground-motion parameters and the predictor variables, which is not always true. In most cases, the best models developed using the commonly used regression approach are obtained after controlling just some equations established in advance. Thus, they cannot efficiently consider the interactions between the dependent and indepen-dent variables. One of the major advantages of the GP/OLS approach over the traditional regression analysis is its ability to derive explicit relationships for PGA, PGV and PGD without assuming prior forms of the existing relationships. The best solutions (equations) evolved by this technique are determined after controlling numerous preliminary models, even millions of linear and nonlinear models ( Alavi et al., 2011 ).

However, it is notable that the GP-based methods are extremely data sets like the one used in this paper are employed. Using any form of optimally controlling the parameters of the run (e.g., GAs), can significantly improve the performance of their algorithms. Also, one of the main goals of introducing expert systems, such as the
GP-based approaches, into the design processes is better handling of based on imprecise and incomplete information about the features estimates of the outcome before performing any extensive laboratory or field work. The GP/OLS approa ch employed in this research is based on the data alone to determine the structure and parameters of the model. Thus, the derived GMPEs are considered to be mostly valid based analyses are suggested to be compared with those obtained using deterministic methods. 7. Validity verification
To further verify the validity of the GP/OLS-based GMPEs, they were employed to predict the ground-motion parameters for addi-data covers a fairly wide range of magnitudes and distances for rock and soil sites in Iran. Comparisons of the PGA, PGV and PGD predictions made by the GP/OLS models and attenuation models developed by Zare et al. (1999) , Khademi (2002) , Nowroozi (2005) , and Rajabi et al. (2010) for Iran are presented in Fig. 18 .Ascanbe seen in these figures, the proposed GMPEs give a sound basis for simulation of the ground-motions parameters for earthquakes of 100.0 1000.0 PGD (cm)
V (m /s) magnitude 5.0 X 7.7, and distances ranging from 0 X 123 km. The PGD prediction equation provides the best performance followed by the
PGV and PGA equations. The GP/OLS model for PGA prediction remarkably outperforms the previously published empirical models which are specifically develope d for the Iranian earthquakes. 8. Summary and conclusion

GMPEs are not mere combinations of the predictor variables which best fit the experimental results. (iv) Further verification was done by benchmarking the proposed equations against the GMPEs proposed by Sadigh and Egan (1998) , Campbell and Bozorgnia (2007) and Boore and Atkinson (2008) . The nonlinear GP/OLS equation for the
PGA prediction provides a prediction performance compar-able with these regression-based models. The proposed PGV and PGD prediction equations produce notably better out-comes over the existing GMPEs. (v) The GP/OLS-based GMPEs can reliably be used for practical pre-planning and design purposes s ince they were developed upon on a comprehensive database with wide range properties. The proposed equations are remarkably simple and provide useful alternatives to the more complicated equations provided by
NGA. The GMPEs are considered to be mostly valid for use in the western United States and in other similar tectonically active regions of shallow crusting faulting worldwide. (vi) The data recorded during some real earthquakes at different
Iranian sites were used to validate the derived GMPEs. The verification phase confirms the efficiency of the GMPEs for their general application to the simulation of the ground-motions.
Further research can be focused on identifying other predictor variables and incorporating them into the model development.
For instance, the rake angle or dummy variables representing styles of faulting may directly be included into the analysis. The energy input is another important response parameter closely related to the damage potential of the earthquake ( Zahrah and
Hall, 1984; Benavent-Climent et al., 2010 ). Therefore, this para-meter can be studied as an effective intensity measure in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis procedure. Also, the earth-quake source effect and the geometrical spreading are two critical issues that can modify the current empirical approach. 10.000 100.000 PGD (cm) 0 1 2 3 4 10.000 100.000 PGD (cm) 0 1 2 3 4 10.000 100.000 PGD (cm/s) 0 1 2 3 4 ln (PGD) / ln (PGD) ln (PGD) / ln (PGD) ln (PGD) / ln (PGD) References
