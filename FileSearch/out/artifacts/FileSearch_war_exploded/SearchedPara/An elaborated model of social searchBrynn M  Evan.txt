 1. Introduction
Web search has changed dramatically how we interact with the knowledge of the world. Its success in impacting our everyday lives in the last two decades is perhaps unparalleled. Surprisingly, however, researchers have mostly thought about navigating and browsing for information as a solitary user activity, focusing on eliciting a user X  X  information needs and improving the relevance of search results.

This view is somewhat in conflict with prior research by library scientists looking at users X  information-seeking habits by scientists before the wide availability of web search engines, but demonstrated that other individuals may be valuable information resources during searches.

More recently, researchers have observed direct user cooperation during web-based information seeking. Morris (2008) conducted a survey of 209 enterprise users, revealing that nearly half engaged in explicit collaboration on joint search tasks extension, collaborative search is the act of working jointly on a search problem. Certainly, active collaboration by multiple parties does occur under some circumstance (e.g., enterprise settings); at other times, and perhaps for a greater majority of searches, users may interact with others remotely, asynchronously ( Rodden, 1991 ), and even involuntarily and implicitly.
As we shall see, it is clear that a wide range of collaboration happens in search episodes, including individual searchers who momentarily make use of peers, colleagues, and social resources as part of their otherwise personal search goals. Such episodes represent momentary collaborations in the scope of a larger search task. We are interested in this entire range of collaboration, from loosely coordinated searches, where perhaps only the search result is distributed to others, to highly coordinated searches, where people interact before, during, and after the search episode.

We refer to any search that contains social interactions to be  X  X  X ocial search. X  The general term  X  X  X ocial search X  has been applied widely in the field of Web 2.0 to describe searches that: utilize social and expertise networks; are done in shared social workspaces; or involve social data mining or collective intelligence processes to improve the search process.

Our definition of  X  X  X ocial search X  is intended to be broad, to include a range of possible social interactions and collabora-tions that may facilitate information seeking and sensemaking tasks: actions may be explicit or implicit, co-located or remote, synchronous or asynchronous.

Our focus, therefore, is to bring some clarity to how social search occurs in the real world. We analyzed the self-reported search experiences of 150 users from Amazon X  X  Mechanical Turk, and mapped their complex social activities onto a single, canonical model of the extended search process. As we present this integrated model of social search, we note specifically where social interactions occurred before, during, and after a search event. We support the model with observations from our data by describing: (1) users X  search motivations; (2) their pre-search preparation process (seeking guidance, advice, and clarifications on the information need); (3) how they conducted searches according to those information needs ( trans-actional , navigational , informational ); (4) how they shared end results after the search.

We also discuss factors that influence social interactions and content sharing during search activities, and explore the relationship between social interactions, motivations, and query needs. Finally, we introduce preliminary findings from the second survey on difficult and failed search efforts, discussing how query needs and social interactions may differ in cases of search failures.
 We present our results in four parts: Part 1: characterization of social search.
 Part 2: factors of social interaction and content sharing.
 Part 3: patterns between pre-search and post-search social interactions.
 Part 4: preliminary results of failed and difficult search data.

In the rest of this paper, we briefly review past research works in this area, describe our survey and data collection pro-cedure, and present the canonical model, both as a diagram and with quantitative support and anecdotal case studies of ac-tual behavior. We conclude with design implications, limitations, and some general remarks. 2. Related work
Until quite recently, researchers have mostly thought about navigating and browsing for information as a single user ing the behavioral patterns of users as they search for information led to a basic model of information-seeking characterized expanded this model to describe how the user acknowledges and defines the information need, formulates the query, exe-cutes the search, and examines and internalizes the results ( Marchionini, 1995 ). Choo et al. (1999) and Bates (2002) have subsequently presented more integrated models of search on the web. However, the  X  X  X odes of information seeking X  that they discuss focus more on categories of search behaviors and motivations, than on how people actually accomplish search.
Like much of the information-seeking literature, this work overlooks the role of other individuals in search, instead focusing on the search act from a single user X  X  perspective.

It is interesting, therefore, that library scientists have recognized for some time that other individuals may be valuable information resources during the search process ( Wilson, 1981 ). Even prior to the search,  X  X  X he inquirer decides whether to discuss his problem with a colleague or go to whatever literature or information center may be available X  ( Taylor, 1968 ). Later, users refine their topic selection in preparation for the search by consulting friends and colleagues who serve
Shepherd, 1983 ). More recently, Twidale et al. (1997) have highlighted the prevalence and benefits of collaborative search-ing. By studying the behavior of library users at computer terminals and throughout the library, they observed that co-lo-cated, synchronous collaboration occurs both during the search process and after obtaining the end product (e.g., query results). These findings, in particular, suggest that we should expand our investigation of  X  X  X earch X  to include the periods of time surrounding the user X  X  interaction with a search engine.

Most of the library scientists explored the explicitly collaborative social interactions that occurred around searches; yet other researchers have focused on implicit sharing mechanisms as a means for better personalizing web search ( Glance, 2001; Goldberg, Nichols, Oki, &amp; Terry, 1992; Hofgesang, 2007; Konstan et al., 1997; Smyth, 2007 ). Social recommendation systems, for example, use techniques like collaborative filtering to provide recommended items to information seekers
These approaches are arguably also  X  X  X ocial search X  systems since they make use of latent community behavior, even though they typically do not exploit users X  social networks to personalize search. Chi (2009) provides a distinction by referring to such approaches as social feedback and social answering systems, respectively. The goal of social recommendations is to pro-vide implicit social feedback to individual searchers; social answering makes explicit use of social networks.
Considering the related work in the library sciences and recommender research communities, a reasonable hypothesis is that a significant portion of web search involves social acts, and that social interactions can improve the search process. In-deed, an increasing number of Web 2.0 sites provide various types of social inputs, which could be used to augment search. fact used as collaborative tools by groups of users who designate each other as peers. Networking sites allow users to main-tain social connections with peers (MySpace, Facebook) and business partners (LinkedIn). Even search engines are beginning to apply a  X  X  X ocial X  lens on search result listings X  X or example, through votes of link relevance (Google X  X  SearchWiki) or hu-man-written entries (Mahalo). Yet despite the potential of these sites, only a few researchers have explored how such  X  X  X ocial web services X  might improve the search process ( Heymann, Koutrika, &amp; Garcia-Molina, 2008; Yanbe, Jatowt, Nakamura, &amp; Tanaka, 2007 ).

More importantly, we still do not fully understand users X  social and collaborative information seeking and sensemaking needs. How and where in the search process do users interact with others? How can social networks help? What benefit do social interactions and collaborations have on the quality or efficiency of the search process? Morris (2008) recently looked at collaboration surrounding web search activities and found that office workers often coordinated with others during joint search efforts. To support these types of activities, a number of tools have been built for explicit collaboration among small and Cerchiamo ( Pickens, Golovchinsky, Shah, Qvarfordt, &amp; Back, 2008 ).

Past research builds a solid foundation for future social and collaborative technologies. We hope that our work further illuminates the broad social and collaborative needs of users throughout the search process to help inform these tools.
We believe that the benefits of social search will include but also extend beyond joint collaborative (synchronous and co-located) search to more implicit, asynchronous, and remote interactions. Our focus in this paper is to begin to explore a mod-el of social search that may offer suggestions for supporting momentary collaboration and other social interactions in the extended process of online information seeking. 3. Procedure
In this paper, we report on two critical-incident style surveys that we posted on Amazon X  X  Mechanical Turk. Here, we first describe the methods for the primary survey X  X  collection of everyday searches. In Part 4, we describe the methods for the secondary survey X  X  collection of failed and difficult searches.

Mechanical Turk is a type of micro-task market, which can engage a large number of users to perform evaluation tasks its utility has been demonstrated in a number of research domains ( Kittur et al., 2008; Sheng, Provost, &amp; Ipeirotis, 2008; Snow, O X  X onnor, Jurafsky, &amp; Ng, 2008 ).

Following Kittur et al. (2008) , we took special care in both surveys to formulate our tasks to probe for specific information, minimize generalities, and reduce invalid responses. Our results reflected our careful consideration of the survey design: nearly all replies were complete, coherent, focused, revealing, and purposeful. Table A presents a sample of the raw data that we obtained. We have made the complete set of raw data from the first survey publicly available for detailed examination; it can be downloaded from: &lt; http://asc.parc.googlepages.com/2009-08-social-search-survey-data.xlsx &gt;. 3.1. The survey
The survey in both studies was designed to collect self-reports of  X  X  X ritical X  incidents, in which users describe events of a certain class or quality that were out of the ordinary or otherwise noteworthy ( Castillo, Hartson, &amp; Hix, 1998; Flanagan, 1954 ).

Originally critical-incident questioning occurred face-to-face and probed for the details and context of just a single event in order to avoid generalizations from similar incidents. This style of questioning X  X round only one noteworthy incident X  X as been employed more recently in the form of a questionnaire ( Brookfield, 1995 ). Therefore, we designed a modified critical-incident style survey that probed for a search events that occurred most recently . For the primary survey on everyday searches, we recruited users with a specific statement of our purpose:
We are interested in how you search for digital information on your computer. Please answer the following questions about your most recent search experience.

The survey prompted users for details surrounding the selected incident, presented as yes/no, multiple choice, or free-form responses. We collected information related to the search context and purpose , additionally asking how (or if) users interacted with other individuals prior to and following the primary search act. For example, users were shown the following series of search-related questions. Table A shows selected responses to questions 6, 7, and 8 below. 1. When was the last time you searched for information? 2. What kind of information was it? [free-form answer] 3. What were you doing just before you searched? [free-form answer] 4. Did you talk with anyone (face-to-face, email, phone, etc.) before you searched? Why or why not? [free-form answer] 5. If yes, was your conversation related to your current search? [free-form answer] 6. What prompted you to perform the search? [free-form answer] 7. What steps did you take to find this information? [free-form answer] 8. What did you do just after you searched? [free-form answer] 9. If other people were nearby, were you interacting with them or were they influencing your search process? 10. 10. If other people were nearby, please explain your interaction with them. [free-form answer] 11. After you found the information, did you share it with anyone? 12. Why or why not? [free-form answer] 13. If yes, how did you share the information? [free-form answer]
Finally, users provided background information on their job roles, professional sector, and job expertise. They commented on how the reported incident was similar to and different from related search experiences, when the search occurred, and how long it took to complete.

We received a total of 164 replies to this survey. Of these, seven were immediately rejected for being incomplete (95.7% of replies were initially acceptable and complete); we later discarded an additional seven for having indecipherable responses (4.5% dismissal rate). The resulting data set includes 150 complete and thorough responses. We paid $0.28 for each good reply, with a total data collection cost of $42.00.
 3.2. Sample data Our initial survey resulted in 150 complete reports of everyday searches from anonymous workers on Mechanical Turk. sponses about their latest search acts. Consequently, about 2/3 of search acts occurred on the same day that users filled out our survey (48.7% occurred  X  X  X ecently X  and 14.7% occurred  X  X  X arlier in the day X ). 19.3% of searches occurred the day before, and 17.3% occurred more than 2 days ago.

Search acts were relatively brief, nearly half requiring fewer than 5 min to complete. Respondents came from a range of professional sectors, job roles ( Table B ), and levels of job experience, as rated on a 5-point Likert scale ( Table C ).
A majority of our users only searched for information on the Internet (111/150, 74.0%). The remainder used tools that were internal to their professional organizations (e.g., Outlook, software programs, company Intranet). Only two users re-ported using both Internet and internal tools over the course of their search act.

Finally, we categorized each reported incident using Broder X  X  (2002) taxonomy of web queries according to information needs.Other taxonomiescould beused to classifyinformation-seekingpatterns (e.g., Jansen,Booth,&amp; Spink,2008; Kellar,Wat-mation seeking and gathering activities broadly. We wanted a simple framework for classifying search needs in particular, and transactional performing a transaction and extracting information after a source or website is located; navigational following a series of steps to identify a known fact or website; informational searching for information assumed to be present, but otherwise unknown.

There is a rough correspondence between the taxonomy from Kellar et al. and the one we X  X e borrowed from Broder. Kellar ering X  because of its exploratory nature where  X  X  X ou do not always know when you have completed the task, and there is no one specific answer X  ( Kellar et al., 2007, p. 1005 ). Navigational query needs also corresponds roughly to the  X  X  X act Finding X  category when the necessary navigational steps are already known to the user. 4. Results
Our main contribution is that we have integrated our findings with models of sensemaking and information seeking from the literature, and we present a canonical model of user activities throughout the search process ( Fig. 2 , below). We present our results in several parts: 1. First, our characterization of social search discusses our model in three phases: before, during, and after a search act. We illustrate each phase with quantitative data and anecdotal case studies of actual, reported user behavior. 2. Second, we elaborate on the factors that influence social interactions and content sharing. For example, what class of users is likely to engage in social interactions during search tasks? 3. Third, we explore the relationship between social interactions, motivations, and query needs. This section focuses on pat-terns within the data around social engagement. 4. Finally, we introduce preliminary findings from a new study on search failures. We briefly discuss the differences between successful and unsuccessful searching, and how social activities were part of these processes. 4.1. Part 1: characterization of social search
Using data from our original search survey, we discuss our canonical model of social search ( Fig. 2 ) in three phases: be-fore, during, and after search. Although search is a fluid, dynamic process making it somewhat inappropriate to draw bound-aries between different phases of  X  X  X earch, X  we want to examine behaviors that occur before and after interacting with a search engine. Thus, we intend to document user interactions from in the entire, extended search process, even when those behaviors occur  X  X  X ffline. X  We highlight the places where information exchanges occurred through social interactions by the illustration in Fig. 1 . The nature and consequence of these social interactions is elaborated on in Part 2. 4.1.1. Before search
Important search preparations take place even before users turn to information databases and search engines. (For the only briefly reflect on their goals; others gather preliminary evidence on their own; and still others reach out to peers and colleagues to think through and clarify their search needs ( Fig. 3 ). or a motivation that drives the search process. This may be thought of as the context framing stage of search, where user motives and information needs are defined. Requests for information may come from an external source (e.g., specific re-quest from a boss, customer, or client) or may be self-initiated (e.g., finding information related to personal or work endeavors).

External requests (47/150 users, 31.3%): About 1/3 of the searches were motivated by external sources. For instance, a Dell customer support representative was searching for information related to a promotion advertised on another website X  X  search prompted by a specific customer request. The service representative was tasked with finding this information and consequently reporting back relevant information to the customer on the phone.

Self-initiated search (103/150 users, 68.7%): Over two-thirds of searches were self-motivated prompts to find information related to personal or work endeavors. As an example, while creating a spreadsheet of songs to teach to students, a piano teacher was searching for JPG files of sheet music that highlighted certain musical concepts. Since this teacher always works alone, she is constantly  X  X  X eeking new resources to keep piano students interested, and to teach them concepts through enjoyable songs and activities. X  Therefore, this search behavior is a career-related, self-motivated process for continually finding new and better material. 4.1.1.2. Requirement refinement. After information needs and motives are established, search requirements are refined. Pre-formulating relevant search schemas. As an example, an operations technician at Lexus X  X exus needed to collect certain information in order to prepare a new client file. Prior to the search, a meeting was called with several other colleagues to discuss what type of information should be included in the file. This served to establish the necessary guidelines, after which the technician was able to find the agreed-upon information by searching in an internal program. In this account, so-cial inputs were integral to formulating the requirements for the technician X  X  subsequent search. Other pre-search accounts demonstrate that this phase is marked by social interactions 42.7% of the time (64/150 users) both to  X  X  X nfluence the infor-mation need X  ( Twidale et al., 1997 ) and refine the task guidelines. 4.1.2. During search
Although search can be a cyclical process, the during search stage in our model represents the active instantiation of rep-by interacting with a search engine. We detail the three types of searches that we observed in this phase, based on Broder X  X  (2002) query needs: transactional , navigational , and informational ( Fig. 4 ). 4.1.2.1. Transactional search. With a transactional search, users locate a source where they can subsequently perform a trans-action or other  X  X  X eb-mediated activity X  ( Broder, 2002 ). In our sample, this typically involved navigating to a website through a series of routine steps and requesting specific information such as driving directions, weather at a destination, movie listings, or data from a customer X  X  account. As an example, an ambulance chief was required to include in a patient X  X  to MapQuest.com, entered the start and end locations, and retrieved the mileage information.

Although transactional searches (19/150 users, 12.7%) were less common in our sample than navigational or informational ones, over a third did involve pre-search social interactions (8 of the 19 users, or 42.1%). However, users did not engage in social or collaborative activities in the midst of ( during ) these types of searches.
For example, a hospital nurse found a drug listed in a patient X  X  medical chart, but was unfamiliar with how it was used. Be-fore blindly administering it, the nurse decided to look up the drug on the NIH website, a familiar source often used to re-address, and then searched for the drug on the NIH website. The nurse reports:  X  X  X  knew exactly where [the information] would be X  X ust couldn X  X  recall what the answer was. X 
Navigational searches were performed by 42/150 users (28.0%), and of these, nearly half involved pre-search interactions with others (20/42 users, or 47.6%). This class of search did not involve social or collaborative activities during the main search itself either. 4.1.2.4. Informational search. In comparison to navigational and transactional searches, social search may greatly improve tasks involving informational search, which is typically an exploratory process of searching for information that may or may not be familiar to the user.

Over half of the reported search experiences (89/150 users, 59.3%) were informational in nature, involving clear foraging their primary search act. Surprisingly, only two users (2/89 users, 2.2%) sought social inputs during their computer-related search activities. Another five (5/89 users, 5.6%) made use of passive interactions by searching previously-recorded social data on Wikipedia, technical forums, or discussion boards.

Foraging . The basic  X  X  X nformation assimilation X  process described by Evans and Card (2008) illustrates this early foraging phase where users search for information within a specific patch, followed by skimming, reading, and extracting information from source files. Throughout this process, users may update and shift their search representations ( Shepherd, 1983 ) as they discover new items.

For example, an environmental engineer began searching online for a digital schematic of a storm-water pump while simultaneously browsing through printed materials to get  X  X  X  better idea of what the tool is called. X  This search was iteratively refined as the engineer encountered new information, first on metacrawler.com and then on Google, that allowed him to update his representation of the search space, or what might be called a  X  X  X earch schema. X  He finally discovered a key-word combination that provided the desired results.

During this foraging and reformulation process, users may seek input from others for feedback and further refinement of their search ( Twidale et al., 1997 ). While explicit interactions with others were not common (only 2/89 users), the examples demonstrate the usefulness of cooperation. A circulation clerk at a public library was asked to find the Cheetah Girls 2 (mo-vie) soundtrack for her boss X  X  daughter. She began by using an internal search tool where she entered  X  X  X heetah Girls 2, X  although this failed to return the movie soundtrack. After the boss joined in the search process, the clerk reported [in re-sponse to Question #7]:
We had to deduce a number of combinations in an attempt to obtain the item in question. We tried a number of ways to write Cheetah Girls, including hyphens and spelling out the number two. We even had to look up the actual product on Amazon.com for additional information.

The circulation clerk later commented that the boss was a useful resource during this process, providing  X  X  X ariations on the words in an attempt to solve the problem. X  This example illustrates the well-known  X  X  X ocabulary problem X  of human X  system communication ( Furnas, Landauer, Gomez, &amp; Dumais, 1987 ). Importantly, people can help overcome this problem to a certain extent; in this case, the boss was able to suggest appropriate keywords for the topic domain that were obscured to the clerk.

Sensemaking . In fact, foraging and sensemaking loops are tightly coupled. After an initial pass at foraging, users may iden-their search schema and query. For example, while an English Professor at a University was preparing a lecture on a poem by Robert Frost, he  X  X  X anted to look up information on Frost himself as well as any information ... specifically about the poem. X  To do so, he recalled [Questions #7 and 8]:
I went to msn.com and typed in  X  X  X obert Frost X  first. I found several websites that were helpful, then copied and pasted information into the Word document I had already set up. [Then] I typed  X  X  X rost + Out Out. X  [Finally] I went back to the
Word document and began sorting my information. I placed like information together; summarized some information; deleted irrelevant information; and paraphrased other information.

Not only did the professor X  X  foraging involve a series of search queries, he engaged in a classic sensemaking process. He reflected on the material he collected as he summarized and paraphrased the information.

Although the professor performed  X  X  X nformation assimilation X  by himself ( Evans &amp; Card, 2008 ), the sensemaking process could include social interactions. As an example, a programmer from Intuit was searching for a file transfer protocol (FTP) application programming interface (API) built in core JAVA. He began by brainstorming with the project X  X  technical architect. Then he performed a search online, followed by  X  X  X nother round of discussion with the technical architect X  on whether the
API he found (the  X  X  X vidence file X ) would be sufficient for their purposes. In this way, social input and exchange augmented the programmer X  X  sensemaking process. 4.1.3. After search
We refer to the phase following the traditionally primary search act as after search . Following this period of online infor-mation seeking, an  X  X  X nd product X  is often obtained ( Twidale et al., 1997 ). This target information X  X ew IRS mileage reim-bursement rates, next week X  X  weather forecast, or the latest news about autism X  X ay then be  X  X  X cted X  upon through organization and/or distribution ( Evans &amp; Card, 2008 ). Fig. 5 presents an overview of this process. 4.1.3.1. Organizing information. The organization of information includes: saving or augmenting materials, bookmarking a webpage, or creating a new document or presentation. Pirolli and Card (2005) referred to this process as schematizing, where raw evidence is organized and  X  X  X epresented in some schematic way. X  Surprisingly, nearly half of our users (71/150, or 47.3%) created artifacts based on their search products that served to organize, save, or synthesize important information:
Printing results: One real estate agent printed and reviewed the results of a search (public records of a property owner) before  X  X  X iving them to an attorney for legal inspection. X 
Bookmarking: The president of a design company bookmarked online articles about web mashups to read later in the week.

Creating a presentation: The manager of a data center created a PowerPoint presentation (for training subordinates) after finding technical information on cooling towers through a Google search. 4.1.3.2. Distributing information. Such organizational acts additionally served to distribute the search products to others. In other words, many documents and presentations were created with the intention of sharing with colleagues. Pirolli and Card (2005) observed that the end products of a search may be delivered to an audience as a  X  X  X resentation or publication of a case. X  Evans and Card (2008) also remarked that users serve as information filters for others through their organizational, and consequent distributional, acts of bookmarking, tagging, or annotating items.

In our sample, two-thirds of respondents distributed end products either to others or to themselves for retrieval at a fu-ture date (101/150 users, 67.3%). Of these, 88 shared information with others (87.1%), typically face-to-face or verbally over the phone: For example, a floral designer relayed information about local spring blooming flowers to a bride-to-be. Fifteen users  X  X  X hared X  the content with themselves by printing out documents or bookmarking websites (14.9%), which are impor-tive sales group reported [in response to Questions #7, 8, and 11]: I went to google.com, typed in Customer Relationship Management Software Solutions, then searched within results for
Automotive Dealerships. I clicked several links and proceeded to read up on several programs that are available. After-wards, I saved several links that I will be going back to and researching further. Once I am done with my research, I will put together a comparison of my top three choices and present it to the owner.

Additionally, two users reported sharing information  X  X  X imultaneously for themselves and others X  ( Evans &amp; Card, 2008 ). In one case, the manager of a retail store searched for an email containing a PDF memo describing the correct method of ship-ping goods to customers. He  X  X  X rinted the PDF for future reference X  and subsequently explained the procedure to his employ-ees, requiring each to read and sign a copy.

The majority of information was distributed within a small radius of collaboration, to proximate others (86 of 101 distrib-uting users, or 85.1%). In other words, most shared information with close friends or colleagues X  X eople who had requested the information previously, whom the searchers thought would have an interest in it, or from whom searchers wanted to get feedback. Only two users found information that they shared to public (largely unknown) audiences: the University profes-sor giving the Robert Frost lecture and a graphic designer who maintains the website for a small bookstore. The graphic de-signer searched on Google and the New York Times online to find the current best selling mystery novels, and subsequently edited the bookstore X  X  public website to reflect the up-to-date information.

In summary, these accounts X  X efore, during, and after search X  X re meant to document the range of user search behaviors and illustrate that actions may occur individually or in collaboration with others. Our characterization is intended to illus-trate that both highly and loosely coordinated social interactions may occur in any stage of the search process, and that  X  X  X earch X  extends beyond a short human X  X ystem interaction episode. We observed that: (1) users take explicit actions to pre-pare for their search process; (2) they perform one of three types of information-seeking behaviors: transactional , naviga-tional , and informational ; (3) they organize and distribute information to friends and colleagues, extending their search activities beyond a single web browsing session. 4.2. Part 2: factors of social interaction and content sharing
In this next section, we go beyond our initial characterization to review more global patterns in the data. In particular, what factors lead someone to be social? What class of users is likely to engage in social interactions during search tasks? Both inherent motivations and query needs are important factors.

Table 1 below summarizes the results that we will present in this section. First, we review how the motivations of the we defined it, were surprisingly rare, so we exclude that from our discussion here.) We then analyze how various query needs resulted in important social interactions in the moments leading up to the main search act ( before search ) and follow-ing the retrieval of an end product ( after search ). 4.2.1. Factors that influenced social activities (pre-search) 4.2.1.1. User motivations. Many more externally-motivated users engaged in social interactions before searching than self-motivated users ( Table 1 , top of column A). Of those who were motivated by external sources ( N = 47), nearly three-quarters had a significant interaction with another person before their search (70.2%). Self-motivated searchers ( N = 103) had social exchanges much less often X  X round one-third of the time (30.1%) ( Table 1 , top of column B). While it may seem that external prompts inherently involve a type of social input (e.g., the search was requested by another individual), requests may have been part of a prior to-do list or may have been triggered by an unexpected environmental circumstance. For example, when a technician learned from a colleague that a frosted outdoor glass electrical fixture broke, the technician had to figure out  X  X  X xactly what kind of fixture it was X  and, subsequently, the lowest price available. He quickly saw that replacement fixtures were not in the supply closet, so he turned to Google to complete his task. We considered this account to be externally-nificant social interactions  X  X n the context of requests for information X  X eant interactions other than delivery of the request itself (e.g., mostly due to a face-to-face or telephone conversations).

It is somewhat expected that externally-driven information needs result in significant social interactions. Proportionally speaking, this was substantiated by our data ( Table 1 ; Fig. 6 ); however, the reasons why users engaged with colleagues were markedly distinct. Externally-motivated searchers were social almost always out of obligation. Self-motivated searchers en-gaged with others for a greater variety of reasons, including seeking advice, feedback, and personal guidance.
The externally-motivated searchers conversed with others (33/47 users, 70.2%) primarily to identify the requirements and guidelines for the search they were requested to perform. These information exchanges were with the source of the re-quest, such as a client or boss. A social worker for the State of Washington was helping a homeless, disabled client find tem-porary housing, which required learning about the  X  X  X lient X  X  disability accommodations. X  The need for more information resulted in an obligatory conversation between the social worker and the client, after which the social worker had the re-sources necessary to complete the request.

The breakdown for externally-prompted social motivations were as follows: necessary for establishing the search guidelines (23/33 users, 69.7%); resulting from a direct conversation with the requester (10/33 users, 30.3%).

Social interactions occurred for a greater variety of reasons for self-motivated searches (31/103 users, 30.1%). Some searchers wanted to seek the advice of others (8/31 users, 25.8%): When an associate at Circuit City wanted to improve his commission-based sales, he solicited a colleague X  X  personal opinion before searching on Yahoo! for additional sugges-actions were additionally used to: establish the search guidelines (10/31 users, 29.4%); brainstorm (3/31 users, 9.7%); collect search tips (e.g., keywords, URLs) from friends and colleagues (2/31 users, 6.5%).

Of course, these reasons are not mutually exclusive: Establishing guidelines may involve collaborators as the first stage of an extended search episode. A salesperson for a company that imported tile and natural stone received a customer request for 5000 square feet of Pennsylvania Blue Stone for a pool deck. This  X  X  X earch X  involved finding a supplier who had the stone in stock, and really began when the salesperson called several local suppliers to see if they carried the material. Only after learning that his regular suppliers were out of stock, he completed the request by performing an informational search on Goo-gle for additional suppliers.

As these examples illustrate, activities occurring before and up to interactions with a computer database or search engine are equally essential for a successful search. column B). In most cases, these interactions were themselves transactional X  X  necessary engagement to obtain details from the source of the request before proceeding with the actual search. For example, a placement advisor for a dental staffing agency spoke with a new applicant to get credentials and position availability. Following this interaction, the advisor went license was current.
 Navigational queries ( N = 42) involved pre-search interactions among 20 users (47.6%) ( Table 1 , bottom of column B). These interaction were often necessary to establish the information need. The membership chairman of the Embroiderers X  Guild of America recalled [in response to Questions #4 and 7]:
I spoke with the prospective member who needed the information [about membership dues and meeting times]. I did not contact anyone else regarding the searches I was about to do, since the information was needed immediately, and I knew what I was looking for. So I Googled to find the home site for the Embroiderers X  Guild. After finding the link, I went to the pages that had the information I needed.

Indeed, social interactions were typically sought to help establish guidelines and obtain more information about the of the extended search, seeing if others had answers or advice prior to searching.

Informational queries ( N = 89) led to social experiences before search for 36 users (40.4%) X  X nd not simply out of obliga-tion ( Table 1 , bottom of column B). Social exchanges were useful for a variety of reasons: to establish search guidelines (to consultants for advice and ideas for a novel way of teaching colors X  to autistic children); to brainstorm ( X  X  X hrough instant messenger ... to confer with my group X  X ); or to improve search schemas ( X  X  X o know what kind of material would be useful X  and  X  X  X or wider search options and different opinions X ). Moreover, a majority of users who engaged with others in this stage were self-motivated (22 of the 36 users, or 61.1%).

As we have illustrated, social interactions in the search process occur quite regularly, whether we look at inherent search observed during informational searches suggest that social inputs can be invaluable when the information need is undevel-oped or poorly specified. Finally, self-motivated use cases illustrate how other people are integral to the search process. 4.2.2. Factors that influenced sharing behaviors (post-search)
Social behaviors extend beyond the preliminary phases of a search. This is to be expected since searching is a fluid pro-cess, deeply embedded in physical and digital social environments. What factors lead someone to share information with ing factors stem from user motivations, although query need seems to play a role, as well. 4.2.2.1. User motivations. Search acts motivated by external requests for information ( N = 47) resulted in post-search sharing 83.0% of the time (among 39 externally-motivated users) ( Table 1 , top of column C; Fig. 7 ). Of these, nearly all sharing was out of obligation (34 of 39 users, or 87.2%). Users were required to report on product availability to customer requests, pro-vide details on upcoming conferences and workshops to the CEO, or send a map to a friend because he had asked for help.
Only five of the 39 users (12.8%) shared information because they thought others would find it interesting. As an example, an information technology (IT) specialist for the US Navy needed to figure out the cause of an error in a new software program (per a user request). After performing several iterative searches on Google, he emailed the answer to a team of colleagues since he assumed others would eventually face this same problem.

In contrast, self-initiated searches ( N = 103) resulted in post-search sharing slightly less frequently (among 49 self-moti-out of obligation (24/49, 49.0%). Upon suspicion of a plagiarized homework assignment, one teacher searched Google with back with the student. Many others shared information because they thought friends and colleagues would find it interesting worker shared this with a colleague who had expressed an interest in it previously.

Finally, self-motivated users also distributed information to others to get feedback and advice: to make sure the informa-tion was accurate and valid, or to see if the search should be refined and repeated. For example, an audio transcriptionist, unsure of the spelling of one person X  X  name, performed a sound-alike search on Google before sharing the translation over instant messenger for colleagues to verify. In another case: a US Army Medical Chief was investigating Master X  X  programs in education at Johns Hopkins. After getting preliminary results from Google, he shared his findings with colleagues (in a face-to-face discussion) to get their opinions on the degree program. 4.2.2.2. Query needs. Sharing behaviors by query needs indicate that products from navigational queries are more likely to be shared than results from informational or transactional queries. Of the 42 users who performed navigational queries, 30 dis-tributed information to others post-search (71.4%) ( Table 1 , bottom of column C). In many ways this is expected because navigational acts often involve finding directions on a map or weather at a destination, information that is usually meaning-ful as part of a joint search task. Just over half of these searches were indeed external prompts for information; and 25 of these 30 users (83.3%) shared information out of obligation to a partner or external requester.

Users with informational and transactional query needs shared information about half the time (55.1% and 47.4%, respec-worthy. Users X  post-search actions were important for organizing, reflecting upon, and distributing search products; some users obtained critical feedback and validation on their results. In other words, users were engaged in social cognition with others. As we addressed earlier, most information was shared within a small radius of collaboration (primarily with close friends and colleagues). Together this indicates the need for post-search organizational tools for distributing information to interested parties, integrated especially with platforms that support navigational search acts. 4.2.2.3. Motivation query needs. Another way to look at this data is to break it down by both motivation and query needs ( Table 2 ; the data are plotted in Fig. 8 ). We see that the results reflect the same basic observations that we have reported above. A greater proportion of informational queries are performed by self-motivated users (65.0%) than externally-moti-vated (46.8%) (column A). Externally-motivated searches are equally divided between informational and navigational , with many fewer transactional queries, simply because there are fewer transactional queries in general across all users. Similarly, because informational queries dominate the self-motivated users X  search acts, there are many fewer navigational and trans-actional queries for this class of user.

Across all classes of queries, externally-motivated users were more engaged in social activities before and after search than the self-motivated users ( Fig. 8 ). Furthermore, they maintained about equal social involvement in both pre-and post-search phases. In contrast, self-motivated users are slightly more socially active during post-search than pre-search phases, for all query needs ( Table 2 , bottom of column C versus bottom of column B). 4.3. Part 3: patterns between pre-search and post-search social interactions
An additional analysis we wanted to perform looks at the likelihood for someone to have both significant social interac-tions before search as well as content sharing interactions after search ( Table 3 , columns A and B).

Table 3 presents our first analysis of these patterns. Column A presents the number of users within each group who en-gaged in significant social interactions prior to searching, who later went on to distribute or share information with others.
Column B shows the number of users who were not social before searching, but who shared information post-search. The last column (C) indicates how many users never reached out to others during their search X  X hese are the true solo searchers .
Table 3 further divides the data by motivation type: external or self-motivated. From Table 1 earlier, we saw that exter-nally-motivated users shared information 83.0% of the time. Table 3 provides some clarity on who these distributors were.
Since post-search sharing was common among this class of user already, it X  X  not surprising that we see significant sharing behaviors among those who were both social beforehand (column A) and among those who were not (column B).
Of the 33 searchers who had significant social interactions early in their search, 29 concluded by sharing information with others (87.9%). For example, a software developer was looking for a way to program a certain ringtone for a client. He first asked his colleagues if they knew how; then he turned to Google. He eventually shared the solution back with his colleagues because he believed in  X  X  X nowledge sharing ... to [further] our discussion and understanding. X  Only 14 users were not social users (8.5%) performed solo searches, usually for high priority items on a to-do list or environmental circumstances that re-quired the user X  X  involvement (the printer X  X  color settings needed adjusting). Three of the four cases were highly exploratory ( informational ) search tasks.

Self-motivated users show a slightly different story. On the whole, these users were much more likely to share their end products if their early search process involved social interactions ( Table 3 , column A versus column B). Of the 31 searchers who had significant social interactions before searching, 24 (77.4%) shared information with others. In contrast, users who were not social before search ( N = 72) were less likely to distribute information later (only 25/72 users, or 34.7%). Further-more, nearly half (47/103, or 45.6%) of self-motivated users did not engage in social interactions during their search. 4.3.1. Solo searchers
The solo searchers are also an interesting user type ( Table 3 , column C). Why were social interactions not part of their search process? Was it the makeup of the environment, their information needs, or their personalities that made it easier or preferable to search alone? To get a better sampling of reasons, we extend this next analysis to include all users who did not reach out to others before search ( N = 86, but 89 explanations since some gave multiple reasons) ( Fig. 9 ):
Issues related to the information needs (  X  X  X t wasn X  X  necessary  X  X r  X  X  X  knew where to find it online.  X ) were the least common (18/89, or 20.2%). Such cases included: programmers who were looking for a specific C++ library file; the owner of a Gil-more Gang fan site who checked Google for new mentions every day; a film director looking for sound loops that he could use in a documentary.

Environmental factors made up about a quarter of the reasons (23/89, or 25.8%). Some users were too busy to talk to their colleagues; others did not know anyone to ask for help or no one else was around. In other cases, the user did not know anyone more knowledgeable. A tax processor, for example, needed to learn about the deductions allowed for job hunting.
Because he had  X  X  X een doing this a long time, X  he knew how to  X  X  X arrow [his] search parameters X  on the IRS website quite effectively. The one person he had thought to ask, who was  X  X  X ore knowledgeable than [himself], broke his leg and was out of the office for the day. X 
Personalities or personal preferences were more often the cause of solo search activities (36/89, or 40.4%). These revealed that some users have an independent mindset about their work, stated as:  X  X  X  can find it on my own  X ;  X  X  X t X  X  easier to look researching stocks for a new investment. In another (mentioned first in Part 1), the manager of a data center needed to collect materials (including images) for a PowerPoint presentation that would be used in a training session on cooling towers. The manager, in responding to our prompt about why he did not use any social sources, replied:  X  X  X ecause I can find answers quickly online. X  4.3.2. Motivation query needs If we break down this data by motivation and query needs ( Table 4 ), we see about the same results as reported above.
Regardless of their query needs, externally-motivated users who were social before searching were equally likely to share end products (top of column B). We see nearly the same result for non-pre-social searchers who went on to share informa-tion (top of column C). Actually we see a slightly lower rate of post-search sharing for non-pre-social searchers with infor-mational queries (62.5%) when compared to the overall average (71.4%, Table 3 ); and a slightly higher rate for navigational and transactional queries (80% and 100%, respectively), although the number of users represented in these categories is small.
Similarly, self-motivated searchers with informational and navigational queries showed a high likelihood for sharing infor-actional queries, although there were proportionally many fewer transactional queries. Again, sharing behaviors are distributed about equally among query needs for self-motivated users who were not social before they began searching ( Table 4 , bottom of column C).

Solo searchers X  behaviors varied somewhat ( Table 4 , column D). Since few externally-motivated users avoided social interactions altogether, dividing the data by query needs is practically meaningless. Solo behaviors among self-motivated trend for self-motivated users (45.6%) ( Table 3 ).

In summary, there are some persistent patterns in the data. Informational queries are slightly more common than other query needs. Externally-prompted search tasks are deeply embedded in social activities, both before and after the search search guidelines or reporting back on findings. Self-motivated users exhibited fewer social behaviors overall, but remained selectively social. When they solicited the help of others, then tended to stay engaged throughout the search process, sharing end products back to collaborators for feedback, advice, and knowledge dissemination. There may be another class of user who avoids social interactions, but their reasons for acting independently may be readily addressed by new social search tools. Not knowing who to turn to, not wanting to bother other people, and not knowing where to find information online were a few of the reasons they cited. Given this, we suggest that externally-prompted information tasks, self-initiated infor-mational queries, as well as certain classes of solo searchers may benefit from social, collaborative, and organizational plat-forms to support search. 4.4. Part 4: preliminary results of failed and difficult search data
The goal of our work is to provide both a characterization and a few patterns of social and sharing activities during every-day search acts. To gain power in our analysis, we collected a sizable 150 unique reports of search behaviors. We were sur-found the information they were looking for. As a reminder, we asked users about their most recent search acts, which could easily have been failed search attempts instead of successful ones. In any case, this data set is surely biased towards common activities during successful searches. We have performed a follow-up study using nearly identical methodology to solicit and analyze, instead, failed search acts. We present our preliminary findings here. 4.4.1. Procedure
This second survey polled users on Mechanical Turk about their most recent search that experienced great difficulties or failures. Users provided their self-reports in response to a critical-incident style survey, which was nearly identical to the original search survey. Our additional questions X  X pecific to understanding search failures X  X ere as follows: 1. Did you find what you were looking for? 2. What do you think your main problems were in searching for this information? 3. If you were going to re-do this search, what would you do differently? 4. If you were going to re-do this search, what would you keep the same? 5. What was different about your search process this time that prevented you from finding your item as easily?
Of the 152 responses we received, we discarded only two due to spam. Each subject was paid $0.20 for a completed sur-
In the rest of the paper, we generally refer to the first survey as  X  X veryday searches, X  while referring to the second survey as  X  X ifficult searches. X  4.4.2. Preliminary results
In contrast to the everyday (and generally successful) searches described earlier, failed and difficult searches last much longer ( Fig. 10 ). Average search duration in this sample was 10 X 20 min, although 41.3% lasted more than 20 min. Only 12% of failed searches were completed in under 5 min. On the one hand, we might expect users to persist in searching for hard-to-find information, extending them beyond 5 min. On the other hand, much of the search literature has reported short less than 5 min X  X uggesting that failed searches have a unique time profile.

Table 5 presents a comparison between the everyday search survey and the difficult search survey. In Fig. 11 , patterns from the failed search reports are shown in the before , during , and after stages of search in our canonical model, plotted side-by-side with data from our initial search survey.

The proportion of informational , navigational , and transactional query needs differ between the failures and initial search survey cases ( Table 5 , column B). Whereas informational searches accounted for 59.3% of our initial 150 reports, in this data they account for 86.7% (130 of 150 reports) of failed searches. As an example of a difficult informational query:
A camp director was looking for new ways to make friendship bracelets. His first search on Google for  X  X asy friendship bracelets X  turned up only advanced patterns and ready-made bracelets for purchase. The director continued searching, but was unable to articulate his specific information need without being able to demonstrate the technique. Ask.com and other search engines produced similar results. After 30 min of searching he eventually purchased a book of easy ideas, which satisfied his need, but did not provide immediate results.

In contrast to informational queries, navigational (17/150, 11.3%) and transactional (3/150, 2.0%) searches are therefore un-it suggests that informational queries, in particular, may present difficulties for the searcher.

This is interesting considering the proportion of externally-motivated and self-motivated users was nearly identical across both surveys ( Table 5 , column A). Failed searches were performed by externally-motivated users 28.0% of the time (41 of 150 users) and self-motivated users 72.7% of the time (109 of 150 users), compared to a 31.3% and 68.7% represen-tation in the everyday search data.

Additionally, there were consistent patterns in social activities between the search efforts in both surveys ( Table 5 , col-the time (72/150 users) during difficult searches and 42.7% (64/150 users) during everyday searches. However, social inter-actions were much more prevalent in the during search phase for failed searches (42/150 users, 28.0%) compared to everyday searches where this occurred for only two users with informational queries (1.3%).

Following the main search act, both cohorts distributed information to friends and colleagues at almost similar rates: 47.3% for failures and 58.7% for everyday searches. However, what is not shown in the table is that, since many users in the second survey never found what they were looking for (62 of 150 users, or 41.3%), post-search sharing during failed and difficult searches is much more common. Because post-search sharing only occurs if the search was successful ( N = 88), find the common name; then the fisherman performed extensive searches online. The search was not productive, however, so he resorted to taking a photo of the fish and emailing it to his supplier.

Finally, we draw attention to social behaviors during informational searches since this query need was more common in the difficult search sample. In fact, there was a higher rate of social engagement (before and during search) with informa-in our original, everyday search sample (36 of 89 users, or 40.4%). 5. Discussion
In support of recent findings ( Morris, 2008; Twidale et al., 1997 ), our results demonstrate that users have a strong social inclination throughout the search process, interacting with others for reasons ranging from obligation to curiosity. Self-moti-vated searchers, users conducting informational searches, and failed or difficult queries provided the most compelling cases for social support during search.

Despite the fact that direct cooperation with others during search was uncommon in our everyday search sample X  X ikely a and after users X  search episodes broadly. In the following section, we present a detailed summary of our findings and discuss design implications for social and collaborative search tools. 5.1. Summary of results We presented the results of two studies of information seeking based on 300 (total) collected reports from Mechanical
Turk. In both studies X  X f successful everyday searches and of failed or difficult searches X  X ocial interactions played a key role throughout the search process for transactional , navigational , and informational query needs.

Parts 1 and 2 (Sections 4.1 and 4.2 ). In our original, everyday search sample, social inputs early in the search process some-times framed users X  search motives (with external prompts for information) and were often sought to refine task guidelines, to provide tips and brainstorming opportunities, and to inform relevant search schemas. Externally-motivated searchers were typicallyobligatedtointeractwiththerequestertoestablishthenecessary guidelinesforthesearch;forself-motivatedsearch-tipsandadvice.Whilepre-searchsocialinteractionswereequallylikelywithall queryneeds,most ofthe transactional and nav-igational queries were dominated by externally-motivated users who were obligated to interact; informational searches were dominatedby self-motivated searchers,whose social goals wereto brainstormand gain advice andopinions prior to searching.
Following the main search act, users took explicit actions to organize and distribute their end products to friends and col-leagues. In contrast to externally-motivated searchers, who were obligated to share results with the search requester, self-motivated users often shared information to get feedback and validation on their search process. Navigational queries led to the most post-search sharing, but these were nearly all externally-prompted requests. Informational and transactional que-ries led to sharing for reflection on the end products or to get critical feedback and advice from others.
Part 3 (Section 4.3 ). There were interesting patterns in the data around social activities in different search stages. Exter-nally-motivated users engaged in heavily social search processes. Regardless of whether they sought social inputs before searching or not, they were much more likely to share information after their search than self-motivated searchers. Instead, self-motivated searchers were much more likely to share information if they had solicited social inputs earlier in the search process. At the same time, there were some solo searchers who avoided social interactions altogether, but may have done so help), or query-specific reasons (  X  X  X t wasn X  X  necessary for this search  X ).

Part 4 (Section 4.4 ). Finally, we introduced and characterized a new set of data on search failures and difficulties. The breakdown of user motivations was remarkably similar to the breakdown in the everyday search survey. However, query needs were markedly different. Informational searches comprised nearly 90% of failed searches; and social interactions were more prevalent around difficult informational queries than everyday ones. On the whole, social activities were more common before , during , and after searching when users were facing search difficulties than when not. 5.2. Design implications
Next, we offer generalized design principles from the social elements within the model and provide design suggestions for supporting social sharing behaviors. 5.2.1. Before search
Even prior to the formal composition of a search query, nearly half of users in everyday (42.7%) and difficult searches (48.0%) talked with friends, colleagues, and clients as primary sources of information. These interactions were critical for receiving clarifications on the task, seeking advice, suggestions, keywords, URLs, and at times, exploring information avail-vel domains ( informational queries) as well as users who may be struggling with their search are obvious candidates for social support. Design principle . Users need access to resources while preparing for search tasks.

Design suggestion . Software tools could support this resource need by exploiting online social or expertise networks. This might include providing instant messaging access to one X  X  personal connections alongside the Google, Yahoo!, or MSN search box. Or it might exploit a website X  X  existing community to reveal domain-specific experts who would be willing to advise searchers. In other words, social answering systems may provide the right type of support during this stage of search ( Chi, 2009 ). A few existing systems have this aim in mind: Mechanical Zoo X  X  Aardvark (&lt; http://vark.com &gt;) and ChaCha X  X  mobile
Aardvark works over email and instant messenger). 5.2.2. During search During the main search act, users with informational query needs engaged with others while investigating new material.
Failed and difficult searches led to even greater social involvement with others during foraging and sensemaking to refine the query and get feedback on preliminary results.
 Design principle . Users need help evaluating and validating search results.

Design suggestion . Since search websites theoretically maintain a history of users X  query terms, hit results, and search trails, a framework exists for providing social feedback from attention data ( Chi, 2009 ) to searchers. Put another way, the experiences of other users could be aggregated and presented to guide new searchers through a search episode. As a starting point, we can take clues about the search topic from the user X  X  initial query. Of course Google X  X   X  X  X id you mean X  feature and
Yahoo! X  X  Search Assist aid in query formulation at this stage, but do not necessarily reveal the scope of a search space. They merely present aggregated data based on popular (or average) user behaviors, providing mostly spelling corrections and common suggestions.
 Instead, MrTaggy (&lt; http://mrtaggy.com &gt;) was designed to present concepts related to a user X  X  search query ( Kammerer, keywords to users while they are still actively foraging and browsing for information. Related work in the social recommen-dation literature has explored personalizing search with related queries from a community X  X  collective history ( Glance, 2001 ) or from like-minded searchers ( Smyth, 2007 ). Such social inputs and high-level feedback may be especially critical for difficult informational queries where users make multiple attempts to find the right (query) keyword combination or en-gage in long search sessions.

Websites could reveal different types of social support depending on how involved the session appears to be. The solo searchers in our data remind us that some people prefer to try searching on their own first. Thus, users may be more recep-tive to passive or implicit social feedback in the early phases of their search. However, since some users do not know who to turn to for help, sites could later suggest available domain experts from the wider community or encourage users to seek social answering support before the search becomes too prolonged. 5.2.3. After search Post-search organization and distribution was prevalent in both survey samples, but reasons for sharing varied greatly.
Sometimes information was shared out of obligation or because others might find it interesting. At other times, searchers wanted additional feedback or advice, especially for self-motivated, informational inquiries. Moreover, several users saved information for their future needs.
 Design principle . Users need facilities for organizing and sharing search findings.

Design suggestion . All users may benefit from features built into web interfaces that facilitate post-search communication rently supports the low-cost tagging of webpages, and the subsequent storage of tagged content in personal notebooks it becomes naturally integrated with the process of exploring a search space, providing real-time sharing support. 5.3. Coordination in collaborative and social information seeking
This paper partially points out that the social interactions and other collaborative acts during information seeking is cer-tainly more nuanced than simply how people are working jointly while issuing queries to search engines. The data show that people may be coordinated before, during, and after a search episode, and that the degree of coordination varies from case to case.

Some searches may require collaboration before search, but not during nor after search, while others may include only post-search coordination. Highly coordinated information-seeking tasks may in fact include coordination during all three phases of the search process. Fig. 12 depicts how coordination with others may occur in any phase of the information-seek-ing process. (Note: the figure is a rough schematic illustrating the variety of coordination possible in online information seeking. Although the  X  X  X ow X  category only depicts partner interactions before search , we mean to suggest that low coordina-tion is characterized by cooperative activities in only one phase of search , be it before, during, or after). 5.4. Limitations of the study
Despite the surprisingly thorough self-reported search experiences we collected, our study faces several limitations based on our sampling technique. Mechanical Turk is a relatively new tool for academic research, as mentioned in our section on
Procedures earlier. Yet the workers are still largely anonymous, which raises questions about how demographics affects search behavior. Future work should take into account factors we were unable to consider here, including how socio-eco-nomic status, technical and computer literacy, or individual personality traits may influence search experiences or users X  ability and inclination to access social resources.

There are additional limitations with the critical-incident technique. Each user only recounted one search act. While we prompted users for their latest search experience, the episodes  X  X  X resh in their minds X  may have been salient or noteworthy, not necessarily the most recent. One way of overcoming these concerns is through a large sampling where individual (and conspicuous) differences become attenuated. Nevertheless, self-reported critical incidents surely vary from daily, typical, or way to complement our methodology with a sampling of day-to-day search activities.

Third, our survey explored user interactions with the social and technical environments in which they are currently embedded. In fact, this is both a limitation and a benefit. On the one hand, many of our users did not have tools that effec-tively supported social search; therefore, we were only able to measure existing behaviors with users X  current tools and prac-tices. On the other hand, this revealed users X  natural inclination to interact with others, suggesting where in the search process both explicitly and implicitly shared information may be valuable to individual searchers.

Finally, there are certainly more fine-grained analyses that can be applied to our data. It would be worthwhile in future work to classify our raw search data by topic (e.g., Shen et al., 2006 ), to co-classify using multiple taxonomies, and to com-pare our findings to other samples of web search data (e.g., Jansen et al., 2008; Rose &amp; Levinson, 2004 ). 6. Conclusion
This study was intended to document the ways in which social interactions play a role in search tasks online. We believe that it complements related work in online collaborative information seeking (e.g., Morris, 2008 ) that has examined active cooperation during co-located, synchronous searches. Although most of our users were not explicitly collaborating with oth-ers in joint search tasks, we have shown how people can be momentarily recruited to collaborate during certain phases of search to help with individual, but otherwise non-collaborative, search goals.

We further contribute to an understanding of social searches in natural contexts. We have presented over 30 specific examples from our search surveys, which we believe to cover a range of possible scenarios of how social interactions support user search tasks. These interactions further illustrate the range of coordination with others that is possible through the course of extended search episodes.

Our challenge as a community will be to design tools that take into account the nuanced search behaviors and social and collaborative activities of users from many different sectors. We hope that our detailed characterizations of when, where, and why social interactions occur in the search process begin to offer solutions for design. An optimal solution will avoid cluttering the interface or cognitively overloading the user, while still delivering social solutions appropriate to the target circumstance.

Additionally, the majority of social activities we observed in both surveys were accomplished through real-world inter-actions, emphasizing the social importance of others. Therefore, our second design challenge will be to introduce tools that positively augment user behaviors, but behaviors that may not currently exist. People are known to seek the help of others new online and will require attentive integration with search engines and other searching-related work practices. There nevertheless collaborative, social search practices for individual web workers. We hope that the characterizations and design suggestions we have offered enable designers in this endeavor.
