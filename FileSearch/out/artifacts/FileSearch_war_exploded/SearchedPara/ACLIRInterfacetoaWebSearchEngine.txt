Medical document retrieval presents a unique combination of challenges for the design and implementation of retrieval engines. We introduce a method to meet these challenges by implement-ing an automated method for interlingual query construction. This method enables a popular Web search engine to process native lan-guage queries from the biomedical domain in order to retrieve doc-
To cope with various morphological processes in different lan-guages we developed a term normalization methodology, called Morpho-Semantic Indexing (henceforth, MSI). MSI uses a special type of dictionary with entries consisting of subwords. Subwords are grouped into equivalence classes (represented by morpheme identifiers (MIDs)) which capture intralinugal as well as interlin-gual synonymy. A morphosyntactic parser extracts subwords from texts and assigns MIDs in a three step MSI procedure (cf. Fig-ure 1). The result is a morpho-semantically normalized expression in a language independent representation. Its usefulness for cross-language indexing and retrieval has already been proven[2].
Currently, the languages English, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish are supported.

Firstly, we use domain and language specific corpora (A) to cre-ate a target list (B) of data including surface words, word bigrams and trigrams ( data ) as well as their frequencies f req ( data ) these corpora. All target queries are subsequently translated to a set of MIDs (C). This data is encoded in a table F reqT ab each record being a quadruple ( data; f req ( data ) ; M SI ( data ) ; language ( data ) ). A user can choose his query language and favoured target language on a web interface. These user queries (E) are sent to our query construction tool. Again, these queries are initially transformed to a set of corresponding MIDs (F). Us-ing several heuristics we further process these MIDs to a list of possible MID combinations called partitions which consist of sub-queries (G). All subqueries are now compared to M SI ( data ) F reqT ab at which all matching records are returned (H, I). Out of these records we generate possible target queries by a set of combi-nation rules, together with a score which can be used as a measure for its lexical relevance (J). Finally, these target queries are sent separately to a standard Web search engine and merged by a simple frequency heuristics.
Our interlingual query construction tool provides a promising approach to biomedical cross language information retrieval in the WWW. Official test runs are still due. Future work will focus on problems in the query formulation process such as matching prob-lems due to lack of integrity of our subword lexicon and language specific problems[1].
