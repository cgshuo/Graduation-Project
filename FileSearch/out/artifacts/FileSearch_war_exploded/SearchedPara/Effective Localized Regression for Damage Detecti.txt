 In this paper, we propose a nove l data mining technique for the efficient damage detection within the large-scale complex me-chanical structures. Every mechanical structure is defined by the set of finite elements that are called structure elements. Large-scale complex structures may have extremely large number of structure elements, and predicting the failure in every single ele-ment using the original set of na tural frequencies as features is exceptionally time-consuming task . Traditional data mining tech-niques simply predict failure in each structure element individu-ally using global prediction models that are built considering all data records. In order to reduce the time complexity of these mod-els, we propose a localized clus tering-regression based approach that consists of two phases: (1 ) building a local cluster around a data record of interest and (2) predicting an intensity of damage only in those structure elements that correspond to data records from the built cluster. For each test data record, we first build a cluster of data records from training data around it. Then, for each data record that belongs to disc overed cluster, we identify corre-sponding structure elements and we build a localized regression model for each of these structure elements. These regression mod-els for specific structure elements are constructed using only a specific set of relevant natural frequencies and merely those data records that correspond to the failu re of that structure element. Experiments performed on the probl em of damage prediction in a large electric transmission tower frame indicate that the proposed localized clustering-regression ba sed approach is significantly more accurate and more computationally efficient than our previous hierarchical clustering approach, as well as global prediction models.

Clustering, localized regression, structure elements, damage detection, mechanical structures. With the increasing demand for safety and reliability of structures and mechanical systems, dama ge detection by nondestructive evaluation methods has attracted considerable attention recently. The phenomenon of damage in a material includes localized softening or cracks in a certain neighborhood of a structural component due to high operational loads, or the presence of flaws due to manufacturing defects. Methods that identify the presence, the location and the severity of damage in the mechanical structure are useful for non-destructive evaluation procedures that are typically employed in agile manufacturing and rapid prototyping systems. In addition, these techniques will be critical for reliable prediction of damage in structural systems such as bridges, skyscrapers, aircraft st ructures, and various structures deployed in space. Since every structural system is defined by the set of finite elements that are called structure elements, reliable structural damage prediction is us ually considered in terms of the damage detection of structure el ements, which results in changes in structural responses such as static deformations and dynamic characteristics (e.g. natural frequency and the mode shapes). Although rigorous damage models exist, in this work we primarily focus on the aspect of structural damage that is assumed to be associated with structural stiffness as a reduction in Young's modulus or modulus of elasticity (E) of the structure elements [16]. In these situations, there are three levels of damage identification: (i) Recognition -qualitative indication that damage might be present in the structure; (ii) Localization -information about the probable position of the damage in the structure (which structure elements are damaged); (iii) Assessment -estimate of the extent of severity of the damage in the structure (intensity of the damage for failed structure elements). A practical damage assessment me thodology must be capable of predicting changes in the structural stiffness as a function of changes in structural response and dynamic characteristics (e.g. natural frequency and the mode shapes) [19]. Standard analytical techniques employ mathematical models to approximate the relationships between specific da mage conditions and changes in the structural response or dynami c properties. Such relationships can be computed by solving a class of so-called inverse problems [4, 15]. However, the existing approaches for solving these problems have several major dr awbacks, namely: i) a large amount of modal information such as eigen-values and eigen-vectors associated with the damaged structure has to be employed to identify the damage in the structure accurately; ii) the more sophisticated methods involve computationally cumbersome system solvers which are typically solved by singular value decomposition techniques, non-nega tive least squares techniques, bounded variable least squares tec hniques, etc.; and, iii) all of these computationally intensive procedures need to be repeated for any newly available measured test data for a given structure. Hence there is a need to explore alternative, more computationally efficient and accurate approaches for the damage identification problem. An immediate alternative is to design data mining techniques that can enable the real-time prediction and identification of damage for newly available test data once a sufficiently accurate model is developed from the training data. Recently, a number of researchers [12, 16, 18-20] have used data mining techniques, such as neur al networks, to address the problem of damage detection in mechanical structures by using static displacements and dynamic characteristics. Most of these studies , that are categorized as  X  X he direct approach X  require the prediction of the material property, namely, the Young's modulus, of all the structure elements in the domain individually or simultaneously. As a consequence, they are restricted to prediction of damages in mechanical structures with a small number of structure elements (order of ten). The development of a predictive model that can correctly identify the location and severity of damage in practical large-scale complex structures using the  X  X irect approach X  can be a considerable challenge. Increased geometric complexity of the structure causes increase in the number of structure elements (target variables from data mining point of view), which also causes an increase in the number of prediction models that need to be built. This growth will not only increase the time required for training prediction models but also the time required for data generation since each damage state (data record) requires an eigen solver to generate natural frequencies and mode shapes of the structure. All these limitations make the  X  X irect appro ach X  not scalable to situations in which thousands of elements are present in the complex geometry of the structure or when multiple elements in the structure have been damaged simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an e ffective and scalable data mining technique for accurate damage detection in very large-scale complex mechanical structur es. The proposed localized clustering-regression based appro ach consists of two phases:  X  finding the most similar training data records to a test data  X  predicting damage intensity only in those structure elements In the first step, for each test data record, we build a local cluster around that specific data record. The cluster contains the most similar data records from the training data set. Then, in the second step, for all identified similar training data records that belong to created cluster, we identify corresponding structure elements assuming that the failed element is one of these identified structure elements. More specifically, by identifying corresponding structure elements we focus our prediction only at the structure elements that are highly possible to be damaged. Therefore, instead of predicting an intensity of damage in all structure elements, we build a prediction model for each of these identified corresponding structure el ements in order to determine which of these structure elements has really failed. Prediction model for a specific structure el ement is constructed using only those data records from the entire training data set that correspond to different intensities of its failu re and using only a specific set of relevant natural frequencies. Experiments performed on the problem of damage prediction in a large electric transmission tower frame indicate that the proposed localized clustering-regression based approach is more accurate than our previously proposed hierarchical partitioning approaches [7]. In addition, the proposed approach also requires less computational time than our hierarchical partitioning approaches. The problem of predicting damage intensity in structure elements conceptually corresponds to the equivalent data mining problem of predicting large number of continuous target variables. Traditional data mining technique s for addressing this problem simply predict each of these target variables simultaneously or individually. However in damage de tection, due to the nature of the problem, there is no need to predict all target variables but only those that are of particular interest (damaged structure elements). In addition, the characteristics of the domain may cause (i) a strong correlation among these target variables (structure elements) that need to be predicted, and (ii) an existence of high dimensional and heterogeneous data, where different prediction models are re sponsible for different regions. In such databases, incorpora ting this background knowledge into learning process may typically produce more efficient and accurate prediction models. It is interesting to observe that the problem of predicting multiple target variables is also present in other emerging applications. For instance, in a manufacturing process we may want to predict various quality aspects of a product from the parameter settings used in the manufacturing, while on the other hand, in financial markets, given econometric variab les as predictors, the goal may be to predict changes in the valuations of the stocks in large number of industry groups or mutual funds [2]. Significant data mining research work has been done in the area of predicting multiple target variables. Some of these approaches include multitask learning [3], learning to learn [1], curds and whey algorithm [2], clustering learning tasks [17] and learning internal representations [6]. Howe ver, most of the previous work on multiple task learning is based on the idea that the tasks to be learnt jointly are somehow ''algorith mically related'', in the sense that the results of applying a specific learning algorithm to these tasks are assumed to be similar. A key feature that distinguishes our work from these existing algorithms is that our approach does not learn all target variables, but instead focuses on learning only a limited number of target variab les of interest by exploring problem-specific interrelationships among them. In addition, it decomposes the complex problem of predicting multiple target variables from the global data set into a simpler one where particular target variables are pr edicted using only relevant set of data records as well as relevant set of features. Given a high-dimensional heterogeneous data set D with a large number of continuous target vari ables (Table 1), the problem consists of effectively and accurately predicting real value of target variables of interest. The typical data layout used in predicting multiple target variables is shown in Table 1, where data set D contains data records d 1 , d 2 , ... , d ... , f m } is the feature set, while E = { E 1 , E 2 target variables. Each data record d i in the data set D pertains to a specific state depending on domain-specific knowledge.

Figure 1. Each square in the airplane represents the individual damage detection zone (element). The intensity of the element X  X  damage needs to be predicted by a global predictive model. The existing data mining methods that are recently proposed for learning multiple target variables [12, 16, 18, 20] are not adequate for addressing this specific probl em of predicting damages in mechanical structures due to the following challenges: 1. Large number of target variables that need to be predicted . 2. Correlation among target variables . Structure elements in 3. High dimensionality of the problem . The number of natural 4. Heterogeneous data distribution . Since each data record To address aforementioned challenges, we have recently proposed hierarchical partitioning approach [7, 14] to predict the damage in the complex mechanical structures. The hierarchical partitioning approach consists of three phases that are applied recursively: (1) partitioning of data set (2) locali zation of groups of interesting target variables, and (3) the predic tion of target variables. In the partitioning step, similar data records are first grouped using manual splitting or clustering algorithm and then corresponding groups of similar target variables are identified. In the localization step, a classification model is used to predict which group of the target variables is of particular interest and needs to be further investigated. If the identified group of target variables still contains large number of target variables, then the partitioning and localization steps are repeated recursively and the identified group is further split into subgroups with more similar target variables. When the number of target variables per identified subgroup is sufficiently small, the prediction phase takes place and the target variables are predicted using localized prediction models that are built not using all data records from entire data set, but using only those data records that correspond to the particular subgroup. In the partitioning step of our hierarchical approach [7], we have used two approaches, namely manual partitioning and clustering-based partitioning . The first and the simplest method for partitioning target variables into similar groups is to perform manual partitioning of target variables by incorporating heuristics describing spatial locality of target variables (e.g. locations of target variables) [14]. Figure 2 illustrates manual partitioning of the airplane structure. Figure 2. Localized prediction of damage using hierarchical partitioning However, the manual partitioning approach is restricted to using only visual characteristics of mechanical structures, and many hidden characteristics inherent for the problem may not be available for sub-structuring. That was the reason that clustering was also employed as an alternative method to group similar target variables (structure elements) { E 1 , E 2 , ... , E features (frequencies) { f 1 , f 2 , ... , f m } that characterize them [7]. In order to group similar target variab les, there is a need to first define similarity between them using a certain domain specific knowledge. In spatial domains, vari ables may be similar if they are spatially close to each other or if they are symmetric according to some symmetry axis. In damage detection problem, frequencies indirectly provide information about locality and symmetry of structure elements, but they also provide information about the correlation among struct ure elements, which is not available in the manual partitioning . Therefore, by using particular set of features (frequencies), it is possible to group similar target variables (structure elements) that are either close or symmetric in 3D space. In such a way, data records with similar set of features belong to one group of target variables, while data records that have different features from a specific set of features correspond to different groups. When the identified group needs to be further partitioned, different and/or additional set of features that bring additional knowledge needs to be considered (e.g., higher frequencies in damage de tection problem) in order to distinguish among similar target va riables already identified. For example, clustering algorithm applied only on the low natural frequencies may identify the regions that contain structure elements that are spatially close or spatially symmetric, since the damage in those structure elements results in very similar low frequencies. In order to further sp lit these regions, there is a need to focus on higher frequencies, si nce this is the only method to distinguish between two spatially close or symmetric structure elements. The proposed hierarchical clustering based approach for partitioning groups of target variab les and predicting their values is presented in Figure 3. Figure 3. Partitioning algorithm for discovering groups of similar target variables, identifying the group of interest and predicting the values of target variables. As input arguments, the proposed algorithm takes entire data set D (Table 1) and the lowest m 1 features { f 1 , f 2 , ... , f at that level of partitioning. For more details about the

The proposed hierarchical cluste ring approaches have two main advantages over existing data mining techniques for predicting large numbers of target vari ables from high-dimensional and heterogeneous database s. First, they are computationally more efficient, since they hierarchically approach the problem of predicting all target variables a nd use less number of training data records as well as a fewer number of features. Second, the clusters obtained at each partitioning level correspond only to small subsets of similar target va riables and tend to be more homogeneous than the entire data se t. Therefore, when predicting those target variables, more accurate prediction models can be constructed more efficiently by using only the local data from corresponding clusters instead of the entire global data set. However, both hierarchical par titioning based approaches suffer from decrease in classification performance at higher level of partitioning when predicting wh ich substructures contain damaged elements. In addition, pr edicting an intensity of damage for structure elements in specific localized regions also drops at the further partitioning levels. To overcome the problems that a ppear by using hierarchical partitioning approaches, we propose a novel method that is based on localized clustering followed by building local regression models. The proposed approach consists of two phases: (1) building a local cluster around a data record of interest and (2) predicting an intensity of damage only in those structure elements that correspond to data records from the built cluster. When there is a need to predict the existence of the damage in large-scale complex mechanical structures in practice, and potentially its location and severity, mechanical engineers usually measure the natural frequencies of particular mechanical structure. This set of frequencies corresponds to a test data record used in data mining techniques to pr edict the target variables, i.e. the failure in structure elements. The first step of our proposed method corresponds to building a cluster around every given test data record. The obtained cluster contains data records from training data sets that are most similar to given test data record. In this step, we use the notion of similarity, which resembles one defined in section 2.2. More specifically, two data records are considered to be similar if they have similar low natural frequenc ies. The reasoning behind such definition of similarity is because similar low natural frequencies typically correspond to a failure in spatially close or symmetric structure elements. Therefore, only these frequencies are taken into consideration when building a cluster around each test data record. In our proposed approach, we have used two methods for building a cluster around a test data record: -nearest neighbor (NN) approach ; and -density based (DB) approach . In the nearest neighbor approach, the cluster of similar data records is simply built from k nearest data records from training data set, where the Euclidean distance is computed using only pre-specified number m 1 of low natural frequencies { f f }. The number m 1 of lowest natural frequencies is typically determined heuristically from tr aining data set using expert background knowledge. On the other hand, the number k of nearest neighbors is determined according to the number of training data records available per structure element. For example, if there are 20 data records that correspond to different intensity of the failure in a particular structure element, then k is set to 20. In the density based approach, the cluster of similar data records is built starting from a test data r ecord with respect to the density of its neighborhood. The cluster has to contain at least a specific number of data records in a predetermined neighborhood. This concept is taken from the DBSCAN clustering algorithm [13], where for each point of a cluster, its  X  -neighborhood for some given  X  &gt; 0 has to contain at least minimum number of points, i.e.  X  X he density in the  X  -neighborhood of points has to exceed some threshold X . The  X  -neighborhood and the minimum number of points are parameters that are de termined from training data set using the similar procedure that is used in the original DBSCAN algorithm. First, for each training data record we compute the k -distance (distance to the k -th nearest neighbor) and then we sort all the points according to the distance and plot them. The typical sorted k -distance plot is shown in Fi gure 4. Experimental results have shown that the threshold value for the  X  -neighborhood is around the point where the sorted distances begin to decrease significantly [13]. Although it is difficult to determine this threshold automatically, it is very intuitive for a user to observe this point (see Figure 4). k -di stances The minimum number of points is sp ecified in the same way as in the original DBSCAN algorithm, and it is set to k +1. When both parameters (  X  and minimum number of point s) are set, we simply identify all training data records that are in the  X  -neighborhood of a given test data record and assi gn these data points to a cluster. In the rare cases when there are no points in the of a given test data record, we switch to the nearest neighbor approach and build a cluster using k nearest training data records. When the cluster of training data records similar to a given test data record is identified, the next step is to associate which structure elements correspond to th e data records and to predict the failure only in those struct ure elements. To illustrate the principle of identifying corresponding target variables (structure elements), lets assume that the training data records that are similar to a test data record a nd belong to a cluster discovered in the first step are presented in shaded rows in Figure 5. Lets also assume that the training data set contains 14 data records It can be observed from Figure 5, that the training data records from a built cluster typically correspond to the failure in more than one structure element. For example, in Figure 5, the built cluster contains training data records d 1 , d 2 , d 5 correspond to the failure in structure elements E denotes the damaged structure elements). These corresponding structure elements are also presented as shaded columns in Figure 5. In general, depending on the si ze and the quality of the cluster, the number of corresponding dama ged structure elements can vary significantly. records f 1 f 2 f 3 ... f m E 1 E 2 E 3 ... E n Figure 5. Typical training data records obtained by building a cluster around given test data record Although all structure elements th at correspond to data records from discovered cluster are of par ticular interest for predicting intensity of damage, we typically choose to predict the failure in only a few of them. The number of structure elements for which we predict the failure depends on the total number of different structure elements within the cluster. For example, in Figure 5, there are six training data records that correspond to the failure in three structure elements E 1 , E 3 and E n . The structure elements that will be predicted are determined according to the largest number of corresponding data records within the cluster. For example, the structure element E 1 corresponds to two data records, the structure element E 3 corresponds to three data records, while the structure element E n corresponds to only one data record. Therefore, since structure elements E 1 and E 3 have the largest number of corresponding data records within the built cluster, we will predict the failure only in those two structure elements. In general, the number of structure elements that we chose to predict should correspond to at least 75% of all training data records that belong to a built cluster. In the example from Figure 5, structure elements E 1 and E 3 correspond to 5 training data records, which is 83% (5/6) of the entire cluster (the size of cluster is 6). Our experiments have shown that th e failed structure element is always among the structure elem ents that correspond to the training data records within the discovered cluster. In the case when several structure elemen ts have the same number of corresponding data records, the advantage is given to those structure elements that correspond to the data records that are closer to a given test data record. When drawing an analogy between the localized regression approach proposed in this paper and our previously proposed hierarchical partitioning approach, it can be observed that the first step of building a cluster in the localized regression approach basically corresponds to the firs t step in the hierarchical partitioning approach, when clus ters at the first level are identified. However, there are tw o main distinctions: (1) in the localized regression approach here, there is only one cluster that is built, unlike many clusters in the hierarchical partitioning regression approach around a test data record is typically significantly smaller than the clusters discovered at the first level of partitioning in the hierarchical approach. Identifying structure elements of interest that need to be predicted in the second step of the localized regression approach corresponds to the further refine ment of structure elements identified in the previous step. This step essentially corresponds to the further levels of partitioning in the hierarchical approach and represents further splitting of th e cluster identified at the first level of the localized regression approach. When the structure elements of interest are identified, the next step is to build localized regression models for predicting the failure in these structure elements. These localized models are constructed using only the data records that correspond to the failure in particular structure element in the entire training data set. For example, if we predict the failure in structure element E and E 3 then not only data records d 1 , d 2 , d used in constructing the regression model for both of these structure elements, but all the data records from the training data set that are generated for different intensity of the failure in the elements E 1 and E 3 . In addition, unlike the first step, when only the lowest natural frequencies were used to build a cluster around a test data record, in this step only the highest natural frequencies are employed to build a regression model for predicting the failure in structure elements, since low natural frequencies do not provide any useful information in distinguishing betw een similar (spatially close or symmetric) structure elements. The number of the highest natural frequencies is again determined heuristically according to the expert background knowledge. As local regression models, we have trained 2-layered feedforward neural network m odels with number of hidden neurons equal to the number of input attributes. In order to reduce the number of input attributes considered in neural network model, variance-based dimensi onality reduction through principal component analysis [8] is also employed, such that newly transformed features will retain some predefined part of the variance. We have used three neural network learning algorithms: resilient propagation [11], conj ugate gradient backpropagation with Powell-Beale restarts [10], and Levenberg-Marquardt [5]. Predicting damage in mechanical structures using data mining techniques requires the followi ng steps for training data generation:  X  Feature Construction : To build the right data mining model it is important to construct a usef ul set of features that will successfully characterize the damage states, capture the physics of the problem at hand, and be independent of operational loads for a given structure. Since natural frequencies and mode shapes of the mechanical structure meet these criteria, they are selected as useful features. This selection is made due to following considerations: i) th ese quantities can be measured from the actual physical structures, (ii) the natural frequencies represent global behaviors of the structure, while the mode vectors represent the local characteristics of the structure, and iii) the number of features can be limited to very few low natural frequencies and mode shapes compared to the number of degrees of freedom in the st ructure. In this study, however, our features are limited to natural frequencies only.  X  Data Generation : The data for building prediction models is generated by using a typical finite element analysis code. In the typical data layout shown in Table 1, the feature set f = { f ... , f m } corresponds to the set of m natural frequencies, while the set of target variables E = { E 1 , E 2 , ... , E values for Youngs X  X  modul us of elasticity for all n finite elements. Each data record d i in the data set D pertains to a failure state, where the failure state is simulated by failing a single element in the structure and performing the eigenanalysis of the finite el ement model. In more complex scenario, data records may correspond to failure of more elements, but this analysis is out of scope of this paper. In our experiments, the elements are failed in steps (e.g., each element is failed by reducing E from the base value of E to E' in steps of  X  E where  X  is a small fraction). Figure 6. Three-dimensional model of electric transmission tower discretized using beam elements The electric transmission tower (Figure 6), studied in [14], has been chosen to demonstrate the effectiveness of our data mining approach in damage detection. The training dataset of 6,241 data records, 900 natural frequencie s (features) and 312 structure elements (target variables) is generated by failing a random single element by a random amount. This data set corresponds to the scenario of 20 failure states per element (312 elements x 20 = 6240 and one data record for the non-damaged mechanical structure). The testing data se ts was obtained using the same procedure and it contained 7800 da ta records, which corresponds to 25 different scenarios of failure for each structure element. We first performed manual partitioning of the electric transmission tower into four legs and a head (Figure 6), and predict the existence of the dama ge within these substructures. Then, we also applied the hierarchical clustering approach and partition the transmission tower into five sub-structures, shown in Figure 7. The detailed results about prediction performance of these two approaches are availa ble in our previously published work [7]. Here, we only provide the comparison of these two partitioning approaches to the localized regression method proposed in this paper. Figure 7. Illustrative five sub-structures at the first level of clustering employing the algorithm Partitioning. (Figure is best viewed in color) the methods was measured using th e coefficient of determination the target variable. R 2 value is a measure of the explained variability of the target variable, where 1 corresponds to a perfect prediction, and 0 to a trivial mean predictor. If the prediction model is worse than the mean pr edictor, it is also possible to achieve R 2 value that is less than 0. In order to alleviate the effect of neural network instability in our experiments, the R 2 each element from substructures is averaged over 10 trials of the neural network learning algorithm. When applying the localized regr ession method, one of the major issues was to select right set of natural frequencies that will be used in building a cluster around a test data record. Since natural frequencies that are easy to be measured in practice are usually less than 25Hz, higher frequencies ar e typically eliminated first. In order to identify the exact number of frequencies to be used in the first step (building a cluster), we use a heuristic approach that looks for the largest gap between two natural frequencies in the vicinity of some round natural frequency (e.g. the biggest gap around 0.5 Hz or 1Hz). Thus, the building of a cluster was performed employing the 202 lowe st frequencies, since these frequencies were smaller than 0.5Hz. Both, nearest neighbor and density based approach were investigated when building a clus ter around a test data record. The prediction performance achieve d using the density-based approach was slightly better due to a better quality of locally built clusters around a test data record. The quality of the cluster identified using the density based approach was better since the training data points around a test data record belong to higher density regions, which are typically good indicators of valuable clusters. Due to the lack of space, only the results obtained using the density based approach are presented in this paper. When constructing localized regr ession models, only the highest 200 natural frequencies were used. Again, this number was deter-mined in a similar way explained for the low natural frequencies. The experimental results of predicting the intensity of damage in the elements using straightforward direct approach, partitioning approaches (after first level of partitioning) as well as using the localized regression method are given in Table 2. When considering straightforward direct approach, we have also run the experiments using sta ndard regression analysis but the results were worse or comparable to t hose obtained by neural networks. Table 2. Prediction of dam age intensity (given in R for those elements within structures for which hierarchical clustering approach achieves the worst and the best accuracy. 
S For each sub-structure identified using the hierarchical clustering approach, we first compare the average R 2 -value of all the structure elements within the pa rticular substructure. Then, we chose two elements from each substructure such that they had the worst and the best prediction performance within the particular substructure. In Table 2, we report the R 2 -value for these two structure elements, as well as the average R 2 -value of all the elements within particular structures. Since the R predicting particular elements may be less than 0 in many cases (e.g.,  X 1 or  X 2 for extremely poor global regression models in the direct approach), the average R 2 -value for substructures is computed such that the R 2 -value of those models with negative R -value is assigned zero value. Thus, the exceptionally bad regression models will not negativ ely influence the accurate ones. This kind of analysis only helps the direct (global) approach and the manual partitioning, since very often regression models built using these two approaches are exceptionally poor and have very high negative R 2 -values. On the other hand, this happens rarely for regression models built using the hierarchical clustering approach and never for regression models built using the localized regression method. It is apparent from Table 2 that both partitioning approaches produce localized regression models that are more accurate than the global regression models used in the direct approach. In addition, the regression models bu ilt using hierarchical clustering approach are in most cases more accurate then regression models obtained by manual partitioning. Only in approximately 2% of the total number of elements, are the models obtained from manual partitioning M j , j = 312 ,1 more accurate than the models R 312 ,1 constructed in the hierarchical clustering approach. For example, the prediction of element E 145 that belongs to the structure S 5 is more accurate when using the localized models obtained through manual partitioning (R 2 = 0.245) than when using the models obtained in hierarchical clustering based approach (R 2 = 0.165). Table 2 also shows that both partitioning based approaches are consistently inferior compar ed to the prediction models constructed using the localized regression method. It can be observed that even for the structure elements for which the hierarchical partitioning approach achieves the best prediction performance (except for the structure element E 96 built by the localized regression method are significantly more accurate. To illustrate the superior performance of the localized regression method, we plot the R 2 values for all of 312 structure elements that are obtained using the localized regression method and both hierarchical partitioning approaches (Figure 8). Again, when plotting the R 2 -values that are less than 0, we assume that these negative R 2 -values are assigned zero values. Figure 8. R 2 -values for all of 312 structure elements when using the localized regression method (full line), the hierarchical clustering approach (dashed line) and the manual partitioning approach (dotted line) Analyzing Figure 8, it is apparent that the localized regression method is consistently and significantly more accurate than the hierarchical clustering approach as well as the manual partitioning approach. Only for ten structure elements, the prediction accuracy achieved by the hierarchical clustering approach is better than the prediction accuracy achieved by the localized regression method. When the R 2 -values for all of 312 structure elements are averaged for the localized regression method and for both hierarchical partitioning approaches (Table 3), it can be observed that the localized regression method is significantly more accurate than hierarchical partitioning approaches.

Averaged R 2 -values for all of 312 structure elements Localized regression method 0.514 0.108 Hierarchical clustering approach 0.298 0.174 Manual partitioning 0.103 0.090 We have also compared the prediction performance of our proposed localized regression method to the prediction accuracy of both hierarchical partitioning methods after the second level of partitioning. Additional details about the results of hierarchical partitioning schemes are available in our recent papers [7]. Here, we provide only the comparison of the hierarchical clustering approach after the first and the second level and the localized regression method. Table 4.

S Table 4 illustrates how the prediction of the modulus of elasticity for the same elements investigated within substructures at the first level has been changed when these substructures are further partitioned and localized regressi on models are built using fewer data records. Table 4 also illustrates the drawbacks of the hierarchical clustering approach, since it is apparent that for some elements, further localization and the building of more specific regression models results in an improved R 2 -value, while for some other elements additional localization hurt the prediction accuracy. Therefore, the localized regression method still achieves significantly better prediction performance than hierarchical clustering approach, since the improvement from the first to the second level of partitioning is only minor and often turns into deterioration of the performance. There may be several reasons for such phenomenon. Fi rst, at the second level the number of data records that are relevant for the damage in the specific element may be smaller than the number of data records at the first level of partitioning thus causing a possible loss of valuable information. Second, this loss is inevitably caused by an imperfect clustering algorithm that does not necessarily assign all data records corresponding to the damage of specific element to a single cluster. Finally, we show that both the proposed localized regression method and hierarchical partitioning approaches require less computational time for making a prediction than the direct approach of building global models, since the local regression models are trained on smaller da ta sets than the global ones. Figure 9 shows how the time require d for training neural networks (NN) depends on the number of exam ples in the training set when measured on a Pentium IV processor with 1GB of main memory. Training on entire data set (100%) corresponds to the time needed for building global regression model, while the training on the biggest cluster (see Figure 9) identified at the first level, corresponds to the time needed fo r building a regression model in the hierarchical partitioning approach. In addition, in the localized regression method, the local cluster is built only once and it is usually significantly smaller than th e clusters identified at the first level of partitioning in the hierar chical approaches, so the total computational time of the locali zed regression method is smaller than in the hierarchical par titioning approaches (see Figure 9). Figure 9. The computational time needed for global direct approach, hierarchical clustering approach and localized regression method The paper presented a novel general framework for the efficient prediction of multiple target variables from high dimensional and heterogeneous data sets using the localized regression method. A key desirable feature of this sche me is that it achieves a reduction in both data records and the number of used features, which is of great importance in applications wh ere it is difficult to find a large number of training records, or when learning a monolithic prediction model from very large data sets is prohibitively slow. The effectiveness of the approach was demonstrated on the problem of damage detection in very large and complex mechanical structures. Experime nts performed on the problem of damage prediction in a large electric transmission tower frame indicate that the proposed localized regression based approach is more accurate than our previous hierarchical clustering-based approach as well as slightly bette r computationally efficient. In addition, the proposed method is much more simpler and more intuitive than the hierarchical approaches used earlier in our research work.
