 It is very challenging task to understand a short query, especially if that query is considered in isolation. Luckily, queries do magically appear in a search box  X  rather, they are issued by real people, trying to accomplish a task, at a given point in time and space, and this  X  X ontext X  can be used to aid query understanding. Traditionally search engines have returned the same results to everyone who asks the same question. However, using a single ranking for everyone, in every context limits how well a search engine can do. In this talk I outline a framework to quantify the  X  X otential for personalization X , that can be used to characterize the extent to which different people have the same (or different) intents for a query. I then describe several examples of how we represen t and use different kinds of context to improve search quality. Finally I conclude by highlighting some important challenges in developing such systems at Web scale in cluding system optimization, evaluation, transparen cy and serendipity.
