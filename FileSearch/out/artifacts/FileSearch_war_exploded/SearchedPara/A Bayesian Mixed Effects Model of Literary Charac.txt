 Recent work in NLP has begun to exploit the potential of entity-centric modeling for a vari-ety of tasks: Chambers (2013) places entities at the center of probabilistic frame induction, show-ing gains over a comparable event-centric model (Cheung et al., 2013); Bamman et al. (2013) ex-plicitly learn character types (or  X  X ersonas X ) in a dataset of Wikipedia movie plot summaries; and entity-centric models form one dominant approach in coreference resolution (Durrett et al., 2013; Haghighi and Klein, 2010).

One commonality among all of these very dif-ferent probabilistic approaches is that each learns statistical regularities about how entities are de-picted in text (whether for the sake of learning a set of semantic roles, character types, or link-ing anaphora to the entities to which they refer). In each case, the text we observe associated with an entity in a document is directly dependent on the class of entity X  X nd only that class. This re-lationship between entity and text is a theoreti-cal assumption, with important consequences for learning: entity types learned in this way will be increasingly similar the more similar the do-main, author, and other extra-linguistic effects are cally similar types learned under this assumption may be desirable, we explore here the alterna-tive, in which entity types are learned in a way that controls for such effects. In introducing a model based on different assumptions, we provide a method that complements past work and pro-vides researchers with more flexible tools to infer different kinds of character types.

We focus here on the literary domain, exploring a large collection of 15,099 English novels pub-lished in the 18th and 19th centuries. By account-ing for the influence of individual authors while in-ferring latent character types, we are able to learn personas that cut across different authors more ef-fectively than if we learned types conditioned on the text alone. Modeling the language used to de-scribe a character as the joint result of that charac-ter X  X  latent type and of other formal variables al-lows us to test multiple models of character and assess their value for different interpretive prob-lems. As a test case, we focus on separating char-acter from authorial diction, but this approach can readily be generalized to produce models that pro-visionally distinguish character from other factors (such as period, genre, or point of view) as well. Inferring character is challenging from a liter-ary perspective partly because scholars have not reached consensus about the meaning of the term. It may seem obvious that a  X  X haracter X  is a repre-sentation of a (real or imagined) person, and many humanists do use the term that way. But there is an equally strong critical tradition that treats char-acter as a formal dimension of narrative. To de-scribe a character as a  X  X locking figure X  or  X  X irst-person narrator, X  for instance, is a statement less about the attributes of an imagined person than about a narrative function (Keen, 2003). Charac-ters are in one sense collections of psychological or moral attributes, but in another sense  X  X ord-masses X  (Forster, 1927). This tension between  X  X eferential X  and  X  X ormalist X  models of character has been a centrally  X  X ivisive question in . . . liter-ary theory X  (Woloch, 2003).

Considering primary source texts (as distinct from plot summaries) forces us to confront new theoretical questions about character. In a plot summary (such as those explored by Bamman et al., 2013), a human reader may already have used implicit models of character to extract high-level features. To infer character types from raw narra-tive text, researchers need to explicitly model the relationship of character to narrative form. This is not a solved problem, even for human readers.
For instance, it has frequently been remarked that the characters of Charles Dickens share certain similarities X  X ncluding a reliance on tag phrases and recurring tics. A referential model of character might try to distinguish this common stylistic element from underlying  X  X ersonalities. X  A strictly formalist model might refuse to separate authorial diction from character at all. In prac-tice, human readers can adopt either perspective: we recognize that characters have a  X  X ickensian X  quality but also recognize that a Dickens villain is (in one sense) more like villains in other authors than like a Dickensian philanthropist. Our goal is to show that computational methods can support the same range of perspectives X  X llowing a provi-sional, flexible separation between the referential and formal dimensions of narrative. The dataset for this work consists of 15,099 dis-tinct narratives drawn from HathiTrust Digital Li-umes written in English and published between 1700 and 1899 (including poetry, drama, and non-fiction as well as prose narrative), we extract 32,209 volumes of prose fiction, remove dupli-cates and fuse multi-volume works to create the fi-nal dataset. Since the original texts were produced by scanning and running OCR on physical books, we automatically correct common OCR errors and trim front and back matter from the volumes using the page-level classifiers and HMM of Underwood et al. (2013)
Many aspects of this process would be sim-pler if we used manually-corrected texts, such as those drawn from Project Gutenberg. But we hope to produce research that has historical as well as computational significance, and doing so depends on the provenance of a collection. Gutenberg X  X  decentralized selection process tends to produce exceptionally good coverage of currently-popular genres like science fiction, whereas HathiTrust ag-gregates university libraries. Library collections are not guaranteed to represent the past perfectly, but they are larger, and less strongly shaped by contemporary preferences.

The goal of this work is to provide a method to infer a set of character types in an unsupervised fashion from the data. As with prior work (Bam-man et al., 2013), we define this target, a character persona , as a distribution over several categories 1. agent : the actions of which a character is 2. patient : the actions of which a character is 3. possessive : the objects that a character pos-4. predicative : attributes predicated of a char-
This set captures the constellation of what a character does and has done to them , what they possess , and what they are described as being . While previous work uses the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit to identify characters and extract typed dependencies for them, we found this approach to be too slow for the scale of our data (a total of 1.8 billion tokens); in particular, syntactic parsing, with cubic complexity in sentence length, and out-of-the-box coreference resolution (with thousands of potential antecedents) prove to be the biggest bottlenecks.

Before addressing character inference, we present here a prerequisite NLP pipeline that pipeline uses the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003), the linear-time MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007) for dependency parsing (trained on Stan-ford typed dependencies), and the Stanford named entity recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005). It includes the following components for clustering charac-ter name mentions, resolving pronominal corefer-ence, and reducing vocabulary dimensionality. 3.1 Character Clustering First, let us terminologically distinguish between a character mention in a text (e.g., the token Tom on page 141 of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ) and a character entity (e.g., T OM S AWYER the character, to which that token refers). To resolve the former to the latter, we largely follow Davis et al. (2003) and Elson et al. (2010): we define a set of initial characters corresponding to each unique charac-ter name that is not a subset of another (e.g., Mr. Tom Sawyer ) and deterministically create a set of allowable variants for each one ( Mr. Tom Sawyer  X  Tom , Sawyer , Tom Sawyer , Mr. Sawyer , and Mr. Tom ); then, from the beginning of the book to the end, we greedily assign each mention to the most recently linked entity for whom it is a vari-ant. The result constitutes our set of characters, with all mentions partitioned among them. 3.2 Pronominal Coreference Resolution While the character clustering stage is essentially performing proper noun coreference resolution, approximately 74% of references to characters in this more difficult class at the scale of an entire book, we train a log-linear discriminative classifier only on the task of resolving pronominal anaphora (i.e., ignoring generic noun phrases such as the paint or the rascal ).

For this task, we annotated a set of 832 coref-erence links in 3 books ( Pride and Prejudice , The Turn of the Screw , and Heart of Darkness ) and fea-turized coreference/antecedent pairs with: 1. The syntactic dependency path from a 2. The salience of the antecedent character (de-3. The antecedent part of speech. 4. Whether or not the pronoun and antecedent 5. Whether or not the two agree for gender. 6. The syntactic tree distance between the two. 7. The linear (word) distance between the two. With this featurization and training data, we train a binary logistic regression classifier with ` 1 regu-larization (where negative examples are comprised of all character entities in the previous 100 words not labeled as the true antecedent). In a 10-fold cross-validation on predicting the true nearest an-tecedent for a pronominal anaphor, this method achieves an average accuracy of 82.7%.

With this trained model, we then select the highest-scoring antecedent within 100 words for each pronominal anaphor in our data. 3.3 Dimensionality Reduction To manage the degrees of freedom in the model described in  X  4, we perform dimensionality reduc-tion on the vocabulary by learning word embed-dings with a log-linear continuous skip-gram lan-guage model (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the entire collection of 15,099 books. This method learns a low-dimensional real-valued vector representation of each word to predict all of the words in a win-dow around it; empirically, we find that with a suf-ficient window size (we use n = 10 ), these word embeddings capture semantic similarity (placing topically similar words near each other in vector for each of the 512,344 words in our vocabulary.
To create a partition over the vocabulary, we use hard K -means clustering (with Euclidean dis-tance) to group the 512,344 word types into 1,000 clusters. We then agglomeratively cluster those 1,000 groups to assign bitstring representations to each one, forming a balanced binary tree by only merging existing clusters at equal levels in the hi-0111001110 : hat coat cap cloak handkerchief 0111001111 : pair boots shoes gloves leather 0111001100 : dressed costume uniform clad clothed 0111001101 : dress clothes wore worn wear 01110011  X  erarchy. We use Euclidean distance as a funda-mental metric and a group-average similarity func-tion for calculating the distance between groups. Fig. 1 illustrates four of the 1,000 learned clusters. In order to separate out the effects that a charac-ter X  X  persona has on the words that are associated with them (as opposed to other factors, such as time period, genre, or author), we adopt a hierar-chical Bayesian approach in which the words we observe are generated conditional on a combina-tion of different effects captured in a log-linear (or  X  X aximum entropy X ) distribution.

Maximum entropy approaches to language modeling have been used since Rosenfeld (1996) to incorporate long-distance information, such as previously-mentioned trigger words, into n -gram language models. This work has since been ex-tended to a Bayesian setting by applying both a Gaussian prior (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000), which dampens the impact of any individual fea-ture, and sparsity-inducing priors (Kazama and Tsujii, 2003; Goodman, 2004), which can drive many feature weights to 0. The latter have been applied specifically to the problem of estimating word probabilities with sparse additive generative (SAGE) models (Eisenstein et al., 2011), where sparse extra-linguistic effects can influence a word probability in a larger generative setting.
In contrast to previous work in which the prob-ability of a word linked to a character is depen-dent entirely on the character X  X  latent persona, in our model, we see the probability of a word as dependent on: (i) the background likelihood of the word, (ii) the author , so that a word becomes more probable if a particular author tends to use it more, and (iii) the character X  X  persona , so that a word is more probable if appearing with a partic-ular persona. Intuitively, if the author Jane Austen is associated with a high weight for the word man-ners , and all personas have little effect for this word, then manners will have little impact on de-ciding which persona a particular Austen character embodies, since its presence is explained largely by Austen having penned the word. While we ad-dress only the author as an observed effect, this model is easily extended to other features as well, including period, genre, point of view, and others.
The generative story runs as follows (Figure 2 depicts the full graphical model): Let there be M unique authors in the data, P latent personas (a hyperparameter to be set), and V words in the vocabulary (in the general setting these may be word types; in our data the vocabulary is the set of 1,000 unique cluster IDs). Each role type r  X  { agent , patient , possessive , predicative } and vocabulary word v (here, a cluster ID) is associated with a real-valued vector  X  r,v = M + P elements are drawn from a Laplace prior with mean  X  = 0 and scale  X  = 1 ; the last el-ement  X  0 r,v is an unregularized bias term account-ing for the background. Each element in this vec-tor captures the log-additive effect of each author, persona, and the background distribution on the word X  X  probability (Eq. 1, below).

Much like latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al., 2003), each document d in our dataset draws a multinomial distribution  X  d over personas from a shared Dirichlet prior  X  , which captures the pro-portion of each character type in that particular document. Every character c in the document draws its persona p from this document-specific multinomial. Given document metadata m (here, one of a set of M authors) and persona p , each tu-ple of a role r with word w is assumed to be drawn from Eq. 1 in Fig. 3. This SAGE model can be understood as a log-linear distribution with three kinds of features (metadata, persona, and back-ground bias). 4.1 Hierarchical Softmax The partition function in Eq. 1 can lead to slow inference for any reasonably-sized vocabulary. To address this, we reparameterize the model by ex-ploiting the structure of the agglomerative clus-tering in  X  3.3 to perform a hierarchical softmax, following Goodman (2001), Morin and Bengio (2005) and Mikolov et al. (2013).

The bitstring representations by which we en-code each word in the vocabulary serve as natural, and inherently meaningful, intermediate classes that correspond to semantically related subsets of the vocabulary, with each bitstring prefix denoting one such class. Longer bitstrings correspond to more fine-grained classes. In the example shown in Figure 1, 011100111 is one such intermediate class, containing the union of pair, boots, shoes, gloves leather and hat, coat, cap cloak, handker-chief . Because these classes recursively partition the vocabulary, they offer a convenient way to reparameterize the model through the chain rule of probability.

Consider, for example, a word represented as the bitstring c = 01011 ; calculating P ( c = 01011 )  X  X e suppress conditioning variables for clarity X  X nvolves the product: P ( c 1 = 0 )  X  P ( c 2 = 1 | c 1 = 0 )  X  P ( c 3 = 0 | c 1:2 = 01 )  X  P ( c 4 = 1 | c 1:3 = 010 )  X  P ( c 5 = 1 | c 1:4 = 0101 ) .

Since each multiplicand involves a binary pre-diction, we can avoid partition functions and use converted the V -way multiclass logistic regression problem of Eq. 1 into a sequence of log V evalua-tions (assuming a perfectly balanced tree). Given m , p , and r (as above) we let b = b 1 b 2  X  X  X  b n de-note the bitstring representation of a word cluster, and the distribution is given by Eq. 2 in Fig. 3.
In this paramaterization, rather than one  X  -vector for each role and vocabulary term, we have one  X  -vector for each role and conditional binary decision in the tree (each bitstring prefix). Since the tree is binary with V leaves, this yields the same total number of parameters. As Goodman (2001) points out, while this reparameterization is exact for true probabilities, it remains an approx-imation for estimated models (with generalization behavior dependent on how well the class hierar-chy is supported by the data). In addition to en-abling faster inference, one advantage of the bit-string representation and the hierarchical softmax parameterization is that we can easily calculate probabilities of clusters at different granularities. 4.2 Inference Our primary quantities of interest in this model are p (the personas for each character) and  X  , the effects that each author and persona have on the probability of a word. Rather than adopting a fully Bayesian approach (e.g., sampling all variables), we infer these values using stochastic EM, alter-nating between collapsed Gibbs sampling for each p and maximizing with respect to  X  .
 the required quantity is the probability that char-acter c in document d has persona z , given ev-erything else. This is proportional to the number of other characters in document d who also (cur-rently) have that persona (plus the Dirichlet hy-perparameter which acts as a smoother) times the probability (under p d,c = z ) of all of the words observed in each role r for that character: ( count ( z ; p d,  X  c ) +  X  z )  X  The metadata features (like author, etc.) influence this probability by being constant for all choices of z ; e.g., if the coefficient learned for Austen for vocabulary term manners is high and all coeffi-cients for all z are close to zero, then the proba-bility of manners will change little under different choices of z . Eq. 3 contains one multiplicand for every word associated with a character, and only one term reflecting the influence of the shared doc-ument multinomial. The implication is that, for major characters with many observed words, the words will dominate the choice of persona; where the document influence would have a bigger effect is with characters for whom we don X  X  have much data. In that case, it can act as a kind of informed background; given what little data we have for that character, it would nudge us toward the character types that the other characters in the book embody.
Given an assignment of all p , we choose  X  to maximize the conditional log-likelihood of the words, as represented by their bitstring cluster IDs, given the observed author and background effects and the sampled personas. This equates to solving 4 V ` 1 -regularized logistic regressions (see Eq. 2 in Figure 3), one for each role type and bitstring prefix, each with M + P + 1 parameters. We ap-ply OWL-QN (Andrew and Gao, 2007) to mini-mize the ` 1 -regularized objective with an absolute While standard NLP and machine learning prac-tice is to evaluate the performance of an algorithm on a held-out gold standard, articulating what a true  X  X ersona X  might be for a character is inher-ently problematic. Rather, we evaluate the perfor-mance and output of our model by preregistering a set of 29 hypotheses of varying scope and diffi-culty and comparing the performance of different models in either confirming, or failing to confirm, those hypotheses. This kind of evaluation was pre-viously applied to a subjective text measurement problem by Sim et al. (2013).

All hypotheses were created by a literary scholar with specialization in the period to not only give an empirical measure of the strengths and weaknesses of different models, but also to help explore exactly what the different models may, or may not, be learning. All preregistered hy-potheses establish the degrees of similarity among three characters, taking the form:  X  X haracter X is more similar to character Y than either X or Y is to a distractor character Z  X ; for a given model and definition of distance under that model, each hy-pothesis yields two yes/no decisions that we can evaluate:  X  distance ( X,Y ) &lt; distance ( X,Z )  X  distance ( X,Y ) &lt; distance ( Y,Z ) To tease apart the different kinds of similarities we hope to explore, we divide the hypotheses into four classes:
A. This class constitutes sanity checks : charac-
B. This class captures our ability to identify two
C. This class captures our ability to discrimi-
D. This class constitutes more difficult, ex-All 29 hypotheses can be found in a supplemen-tary technical report (Bamman et al., 2014). We emphasize that the full set of hypotheses was locked before the model was estimated. Part of the motivation of our mixed effects model is to be able to tackle hypothesis class C X  X y fac-toring out the influence of a particular author on the learning of personas, we would like to be able to discriminate between characters that all have a common authorial voice. In contrast, the Per-sona Regression model of Bamman et al. (2013), which uses metadata variables (like authorship) to encourage entities with similar covariates to have similar personas, reflects an assumption that makes it likely to perform well at class B.
To judge their respective strengths on different hypothesis classes, we evaluate three models: 1. The mixed-effects Author/Persona model 2. A Basic persona model, which ablates au-3. The Persona Regression model of Bam-All models are run with P  X  { 10, 25, 50, 100, 250 } personas; Persona Regression addition-ally uses K = 25 latent topics. All configura-tions use the full dataset of 15,099 novels, and all characters with at least 25 total roles (a total of 257,298 entities). All experiments are run with 50 iterations of Gibbs sampling to collect samples for the personas p , alternating with maximization steps for  X  . The value of  X  is optimized using slice sampling (with a non-informative prior) every 5 iterations. The value of  X  is held constant at 1. At the end of inference, we calculate the posterior distributions over personas for all characters as the sampling probability of the final iteration.
To formally evaluate  X  X imilarity X  between two characters, we measure the Jensen-Shannon diver-gence between personas (calculated as the average JS distance over the cluster distributions for each role type), marginalizing over the characters X  pos-terior distributions over personas; two characters with a lower JS divergence are judged to be more similar than two characters with a higher one.
As a Baseline , we also evaluate all hypotheses on a model with no latent variables whatsoever, which instead measures similarity as the average JS divergence between the empirical word distri-butions over each role type.

Table 1 presents the results of this compari-son; for all models with latent variables, we re-port the average of 5 sampling runs with different random initializations. Figure 4 provides a syn-opsis of this table by illustrating the average ac-curacy across all choice of P . All models, in-cluding the baseline, perform well on the sanity checks (A). As expected, the Persona Regres-sion model performs best at hypothesis class B (correctly judging two characters from the same author to be more similar to each other than to a character from a different author); this behavior is encouraged in this model by allowing an author (as an external metadata variable) to directly influence the persona choice, which has the effect of push-ing characters from the same author to embody the same character type. Our mixed effects Au-thor/Persona model, in contrast, outperforms the other models at hypothesis class C (correctly dis-criminating different character types present in the same author). By discounting author-specific lexi-cal effects during persona inference, we are better able to detect variation among the characters of a single author that we are not able to capture oth-erwise. While these different models complement each other in this manner, we note that there is no absolute separation among them, which may be suggestive of the degree to which the formal and referential dimensions are fused in novels. Nev-ertheless, the strengths of these different models on these different hypothesis classes gives us flex-ible alternatives to use depending on the kinds of character types we are looking to infer. The latent personas inferred from this model will support further exploratory analysis of literary his-tory. Figure 2 illustrates this with a selection of three character types learned, displaying charac-teristic clusters for all role types, along with the distribution of that persona X  X  use across time and the gender distribution of characters embodying that persona. In general, the personas learned so far do not align neatly with character types known to literary historians. But they do have legible as-sociations both with literary genres and with social categories. Even though gender is not an observ-able variable known to the model during inference, personas tend to be clearly gendered. This is not in itself surprising (since literary scholars know that assumptions about character are strongly gen-dered), but it does suggest that diachronic analysis of latent character types might cast new light on the history of gender in fiction. This is especially true since the distribution of personas across the time axis similarly reveals coherent trends.
Table 3 likewise illustrates what our model learns by presenting a sample of the fixed effects learned for a set of five major 19th-century au-thors. These are clusters that are conditionally more likely to appear associated with a character in a work by the given author than they are in the overall data; by factoring this information out of the inference process for learning character types (by attributing its presence in a text to the author rather than the persona), we are able to learn per-sonas that cut across different topics more effec-tively than if a character type is responsible for explaining the presence of these terms as well. Our method establishes the possibility of repre-senting the relationship between character and nar-rative form in a hierarchical Bayesian model. Pos-tulating an interaction between authorial diction and character allows models that consider the ef-fect of the author to more closely reproduce a hu-man reader X  X  judgments, especially by learning to distinguish different character types within a sin-gle author X  X  oeuvre. This opens the door to con-sidering other structural and formal dimensions of narration. For instance, representation of charac-ter is notoriously complicated by narrative point of view (Booth, 1961); and indeed, comparisons be-tween first-person narrators and other characters are a primary source of error for all models tested above. The strategy we have demonstrated sug-gests that it might be productive to address this by modeling the interaction of character and point of view as a separate effect analogous to authorship.
It is also worth noting that the models tested above diverge from many structuralist theories of narrative (Propp, 1998) by allowing multiple in-stances of the same persona in a single work. Learning structural limitations on the number of  X  X rotagonists X  likely to coexist in a single story, for example, may be another fruitful area to ex-plore. In all cases, the machinery of hierarchical models gives us the flexibility to incorporate such effects at will, while also being explicit about the theoretical assumptions that attend them.
