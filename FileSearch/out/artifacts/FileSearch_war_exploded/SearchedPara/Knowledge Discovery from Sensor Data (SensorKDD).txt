 Sensor data is being collected at an unprecedented rate across a variety of domains from a broad spectrum of sources, such as wide -area sensor infrastructures, remote sensing instruments , RFIDs, and wireless sensor networks . With the r ecent proliferation of smart -phones, and similar GPS enabled mobile devices, collection of sensor data is no longer limited to scientific communities, but has reached general public. With massive volumes of such d isparate, dynamic, and geographically distr ibuted data available, many high -priority applications have been identified that involve analysis of such data to solve real world problems such as understanding climate change and its impacts , electric grid monitoring, disaster preparedness and management , national or homeland security, and the management of critical infrastructures. Given the unique characteristics of senso r data, particularly its spatio temporal nature and presence of constraints associated with the data collection and computational reso urces, there have been many research efforts to analyze the sensor data which build upon the general research in the data mining community but are significantly different in terms of how they address the specific challenges encountered when dealing with se nsor data. In particular, t he raw data from sensors need s to be efficiently managed and transformed to usable information through data fusion, which in turn must be converted to predictive insights via knowledge discovery, ultimately facilitating automated or human -induced tactical decisions or strategic policy based on decision sciences and decision support systems.
 Keeping in view the requirements of the emerging field of knowledge discovery from sensor data, we took initiative to develop a commun ity of r esearchers with common interests and scientific goals, which culminated into the organizat ion of Sensor KDD series of workshops in conjunction with the prestigious ACM SIGKDD International Conference of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. In this report, w e summarize events at the Fourth ACM -SIGKDD International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery form Sensor Data (Sensor KDD 2010 ). As wide -area sensor infrastructures, remote sensors, RFIDs, and wireless sensor networks are becoming ubiquitous , t he challenges for the knowledge discovery community are expected to be immense. On the one hand, dynamic data streams or events require real -time analysis methodologies and systems, while on the other hand centralized processing through high end computing is also required for generating offline predictive insights, which in turn can facilitate real -time analysis. The online and real -time knowledge discovery imply immediate opportunities as well as intriguing short -and long -term challenges for practitioners and researchers in knowledge discovery. The opportunities would be to develop new data mining approaches and adapt traditional and emerging knowledge discovery methodologies to the requirements of the emerging problems. In addition, emerging societal prob lems require knowledge discovery solutions that are designed to investigate anomalies, hotspots, changes, extremes and nonlinear processes, and departures from the normal. According to the data mining and domain experts present at the NSF -sponsored Next Ge neration Data Mining Summit (NGDM  X 09) held in October 2009,  X  X inding the next generation of solutions to these challenges is critical to sustain our world and civilization X  [1]. Some of the organizers of the SensorKDD workshop were part of the summit. The 4 th International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data (SensorKDD -2010 ) is a step in bringing researchers together to address these challenges and moving toward the development of the next generation data mining solutions require to address th ese challenges.
 The theme for the 2010 SensorKDD workshop is around four focus areas: offline and online knowledge discovery from sensor data, decision and policy support, theoretical models for sensor and streaming data, and case studies in national and g lobal priority applications. The workshop brings together researchers from academia, government, and the industry working in various aspects of knowledge discovery from sensor data . The motivation for the SensorKDD -workshop in conjunction with the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining stems from the increasing need for a forum to exchange ideas and recent research results, and to facilitate collaboration and dialog between academia, government, and industrial stakeholders. The expected ubiquity of sensors in the future, combined with the critical roles they are expected to play in high priority application solutions, point to an era of unprecedented growth and opportunities. The requirements described earlier imply immediat e opportunities as well as intriguing short -and long -term challenges for practitioners and researchers in knowledge discovery. In addition, the knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) community would be called upon, again and again, as partners with dom ain experts to solve critical application solutions in business and government, as well as in the domain sciences and engineering.
 The first workshop was organized in 2007. The positive feedback from the previous workshop attendees and our own experiences and interactions with the government agencies such as the United States Department of Homeland Security, United States Department of Defense, and involvement with numerous projects on knowledge discovery from sensor data, has encouraged us to continue this workshop. We believe that the ACM SIGKDD conference provides the right forum to organize this workshop as it brings the KDD community together in this important area to establish a much needed leadership position in research and practice in the near term, as well as in the long term. The previous three workshops  X  SensorKDD X 07 , SensorKDD X 08 , ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining , respectivel y, attracted several participants as well as many high quality papers and presentations. The 2007 workshop was attended by more than seventy registered participants. The workshop program includes presentations by authors of six accepted full papers and f our invited speakers. The invited speakers were Prof. Pedro Domingos of the University of Washington, Prof. Joydeep Ghosh of the University of Texas, Austin, Prof. Hillol Kargupta of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and Dr. Brian Worley of th e Oak Rid ge National Laboratory (ORNL). There were also poster presentations by authors of six accepted short papers. The extended versions of papers presented at the workshop were developed into a book titled Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data [1] , the first book published in this specific discipline. The 2008 workshop was attended by more than 60 registered participants. There were presentations by authors of seven accepted full papers and six accepted short papers; the workshop program also include p resentations by two invited speakers  X  Prof. Jiawei Han of the University of Illinois at Urbana -Champaign and Dr. Kendra Moore of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency . The extended versions of papers presented at the 2008 workshop are scheduled f or publication as Springer's LNCS post -proceedings in 2009 . The 2009 workshop was attended by several registered participants. There were presentations by authors of eight accepted full papers, eight accepted short papers, two entries for the SensorKDD -20 09 cup, and three invited speakers. The invited speakers were Prof. Carlos Guestrin of Carnegie Mellon University, Dr. Aurelie Lozano of IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, and Mr. Alessandro Donati of the European Space Agency . The extended versions of paper s presented at the 2009 workshop are scheduled for publication as Springer's LNCS post -proceedings in 2010. The best paper, two best student papers, and two SensorKDD -2009 cup entries were awarded certificates and cash prizes. The prizes were donated by th e Computational Sciences and Engineering Division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Cooperating Objects Network of Excellence of the European Union. The workshop was partially sponsored by the Geographic Information Science and Technology Group of C SED at ORNL and Cooperating Objects Network of Excellence (CONET). The highlights of the SensorKDD 2010 workshop were oral presentations of accepted papers and an invited talk . The workshop featured one invited speaker: Prof Philip S. Yu of University of Illinois at Chicago, that talks about Mining Data Streams. Prof. Yu refers in the abstract of his talk: "The problem of streaming data has become increasingly importance in recent years. The ubiquitous presence of data streams in a number of practical domains has generated a lot of research in this area. Sensor network is a typical example of data stream applications. Problems such as data mining which have been widely studied for traditional data sets cannot be easily solve d for the data stream domain. This is because the large volume of data arriving in a stream renders most algorithms to inefficient as most mining algorithms require multiple scans of data which is unrealistic for streaming data. More importantly, the chara cteristics of the data stream can change over time and the evolving pattern needs to be captured. Furthermore, the stream data can often be noisy as in sensor data streams. This talk will provide an overview, discuss the issues and focus on how to mine un certain data streams and massive graph streams." In addition to the Invited speaker, the PC selected, based on a minimum of two reviews per paper, five full papers and six short papers. The eleven papers spanned a broad spectrum of applications using senso r data. Interestingly, one of the most popular applications targeted by the authors was smart and energy aware buildings, which follows the general interest in sustainability across the world. Papers by Chikhaoui et al ., Chen et al ., Rashidi &amp; Cook, and Ma rwah et al ., all focused on problems associated with monitoring energy consumption in homes and data centers. Another new area that attracted interest among authors as well as the workshop audience was in the area of human activity monitoring using sensors attached to the human body. Papers by Kwapisz et al . and Srinivasan et al . applied machine learning methods to predict the activities of individuals using sensor data. In particular, the paper by Kwapisz et al . showed how the activity of an individual can be monitored using data collected using a smartphone ( Iphone etc. ), whic h highlights the possibilities for knowledge discovery research from data collected by such widely used devices . In addition, there were several papers that dealt with classical senso r network related problems, such as distributed and embedded computing, as described in papers by Djuric &amp; Vucetic and Rodriguez et al., among others. The data mining methods used by the authors also broadly encompass all key areas including clustering [Ro driguez et al., Hassani et al.] , classification [Kwapisz et al., Srinivasan et al., Chen et al., Rashidi &amp; Cook, Djuric &amp; Vucetic] , frequent pattern mining [Chikhouai et al.] , and anomaly detection [Marwah et al., Jiang et al.] . All papers presented at the workshop are available in [4]. Below is a list of accepted full papers and their respective authors:  X  Activity Recognition using Cell Phone Accelerometers  X  A New Algorithm Based on Sequential Pattern Mining for  X  Activity Recognition Using Actigraph Sensor  X  Network Comprehension by Clu stering Streaming Sensors  X  Energy Prediction Based on Resident X  X  Activity The following is a list of accepted short papers and thei r respective authors:  X  Multi Home Transfer Learning for Resident Activity  X  Using Semantic Annotation for Knowledge Extraction from  X  Random Kernel Perceptron on ATTiny2313 Microcontroller  X  Anomalous Thermal Behavior Detection in Data Centers  X  Self -Organizing Energy Aware Clustering of Nodes in  X  Anomaly Localization by Joint Spa rse PCA in Wireless Extracting knowledge and emerging patterns from sensor data is a nontrivial task. The challenges for the knowledge discovery community ar e expected to be immense. As ev idenced from the participation and quality of submissions to the previous three Sensor KDD workshops, it is clear that the  X  Knowledge Disco very from Sensor Data or Sensor KDD  X  is a growing area and an important specialty (sub -area) within knowledge discov ery. The Sensor KDD workshop is proven to be an attractive forum for the researchers from academia, industry and governme nt, to ex change ideas, initiate collaborations and lay foundation to the future of this impor tant and growing area. The work shop witness ed lively partici pation from all quarters, gener ated interesting discussion s immediately after each presen tation and as well as at the end of the workshop. All partic ipants agreed for con tinued patronage for the Sensor KDD workshop. In addition to the ACM workshop proceedings, extended papers will be pub lished as post workshop proceed ings in Springer's  X  X ecture Notes in Computer Science X  series.
