 In sociology, the term collective behavior is used to denote mass activities that are not centrally coordi-nated (Blumer, 1951). Collective behavior is dif-ferent from group behavior in the following ways: (a) it involves limited social interaction, (b) mem-bership is fluid, and (c) it generates weak and un-conventional norms (Smelser, 1963). In this paper, we focus on the computational analysis of collective discourse , a collective behavior seen in interactive content contribution and text summarization in on-line social media. In collective discourse each in-dividual X  X  behavior is largely independent of that of other individuals.

In social media, discourse (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) is often a collective reaction to an event. One scenario leading to collective reaction to a well-defined subject is when an event occurs (a movie is released, a story occurs, a paper is published) and people independently write about it (movie reviews, news headlines, citation sentences). This process of content generation happens over time, and each per-son chooses the aspects to cover. Each event has an onset and a time of death after which nothing is written about it. Tracing the generation of content over many instances will reveal temporal patterns that will allow us to make sense of the text gener-ated around a particular event.

To understand collective discourse, we are inter-ested in behavior that happens over a short period of time. We focus on topics that are relatively well-defined in scope such as a particular event or a single news event that does not evolve over time. This can eventually be extended to events and issues that are evolving either in time or scope such as elections, wars, or the economy.

In social sciences and the study of complex sys-tems a lot of work has been done to study such col-lective systems, and their properties such as self-organization (Page, 2007) and diversity (Hong and Page, 2009; Fisher, 2009). However, there is little work that studies a collective system in which mem-bers individually write summaries.

In most of this paper, we will be concerned with developing a complex systems view of the set of col-lectively written summaries, and give evidence of the diversity of perspectives and its cause. We be-lieve that out experiments will give insight into new models of text generation, which is aimed at model-ing the process of producing natural language texts, and is best characterized as the process of mak-ing choices between alternate linguistic realizations, also known as lexical choice (Elhadad, 1995; Barzi-lay and Lee, 2002; Stede, 1995). In summarization, a number of previous methods have focused on diversity. (Mei et al., 2010) in-troduce a diversity-focused ranking methodology based on reinforced random walks in information networks. Their random walk model introduces the rich-gets-richer mechanism to PageRank with rein-forcements on transition probabilities between ver-tices. A similar ranking model is the Grasshopper ranking model (Zhu et al., 2007), which leverages an absorbing random walk. This model starts with a regular time-homogeneous random walk, and in each step the node with the highest weight is set as an absorbing state. The multi-view point sum-marization of opinionated text is discussed in (Paul et al., 2010). Paul et al. introduce Compar-ative LexRank , based on the LexRank ranking model (Erkan and Radev, 2004). Their random walk formulation is to score sentences and pairs of sen-tences from opposite viewpoints (clusters) based on both their representativeness of the collection as well as their contrastiveness with each other. Once a lex-ical similarity graph is built, they modify the graph based on cluster information and perform LexRank on the modified cosine similarity graph.

The most well-known paper that address diver-sity in summarization is (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998), which introduces Maximal Marginal Rele-vance (MMR). This method is based on a greedy algorithm that picks sentences in each step that are the least similar to the summary so far. There are a few other diversity-focused summarization sys-tems like C-LexRank (Qazvinian and Radev, 2008), which employs document clustering. These papers try to increase diversity in summarizing documents, but do not explain the type of the diversity in their in-puts. In this paper, we give an insightful discussion on the nature of the diversity seen in collective dis-course, and will explain why some of the mentioned methods may not work under such environments.
In prior work on evaluating independent contri-butions in content generation, Voorhees (Voorhees, 1998) studied IR systems and showed that rele-vance judgments differ significantly between hu-mans but relative rankings show high degrees of sta-bility across annotators. However, perhaps the clos-est work to this paper is (van Halteren and Teufel, 2004) in which 40 Dutch students and 10 NLP re-searchers were asked to summarize a BBC news re-port, resulting in 50 different summaries. Teufel and van Halteren also used 6 DUC 1 -provided sum-maries, and annotations from 10 student participants and 4 additional researchers, to create 20 summaries for another news article in the DUC datasets. They calculated the Kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996; Krip-pendorff, 1980) and observed high agreement, indi-cating that the task of atomic semantic unit (factoid) extraction can be robustly performed in naturally oc-curring text, without any copy-editing.

The diversity of perspectives and the unprece-dented growth of the factoid inventory also affects evaluation in text summarization. Evaluation meth-ods are either extrinsic, in which the summaries are evaluated based on their quality in performing a spe-cific task (Sp  X  arck-Jones, 1999) or intrinsic where the quality of the summary itself is evaluated, regardless of any applied task (van Halteren and Teufel, 2003; Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004). These evaluation methods assess the information content in the sum-maries that are generated automatically.

Finally, recent research on analyzing online so-cial media shown a growing interest in mining news stories and headlines because of its broad appli-cations ranging from  X  X eme X  tracking and spike detection (Leskovec et al., 2009) to text summa-rization (Barzilay and McKeown, 2005). In sim-ilar work on blogs, it is shown that detecting top-ics (Kumar et al., 2003; Adar et al., 2007) and sen-timent (Pang and Lee, 2004) in the blogosphere can help identify influential bloggers (Adar et al., 2004; Java et al., 2006) and mine opinions about prod-ucts (Mishne and Glance, 2006). The datasets used in our experiments represent two completely different categories: news headlines, and scientific citation sentences. The headlines datasets consist of 25 clusters of news headlines collected from Google News 2 , and the citations datasets have 25 clusters of citations to specific scientific papers from the ACL Anthology Network (AAN) 3 . Each cluster consists of a number of unique summaries (headlines or citations) about the same artifact (non-evolving news story or scientific paper) written by different people. Table 1 lists some of the clusters with the number of summaries in them.
 3.1 Nuggets vs. Factoids We define an annotation task that requires explicit definitions that distinguish between phrases that rep-resent the same or different information units. Un-fortunately, there is little consensus in the literature on such definitions. Therefore, we follow (van Hal-teren and Teufel, 2003) and make the following dis-tinction. We define a nugget to be a phrasal infor-mation unit. Different nuggets may all represent the same atomic semantic unit, which we call as a factoid . In the following headlines, which are ran-domly extracted from the redsox dataset, nuggets are manually underlined.
These 3 headlines contain 9 nuggets, which rep-resent 5 factoids or classes of equivalent nuggets.
This example suggests that different headlines on the same story written independently of one an-other use different phrases (nuggets) to refer to the same semantic unit (e.g.,  X  X ed sox X  vs.  X  X oston X  vs.  X  X oston red sox X ) or to semantic units corresponding to different aspects of the story (e.g.,  X 37 arrests X  vs.  X  X ockies X ). In the former case different nuggets are used to represent the same factoid, while in the latter case different nuggets are used to express different factoids. This analogy is similar to the definition of factoids in (van Halteren and Teufel, 2004).
The following citation sentences to Koehn X  X  work suggest that a similar phenomenon also happens in citations.
 where the first author mentions  X  X haraoh X  as a contribution of Koehn et al, but the second and third use different nuggets to represent the same contribu-tion: use of trigrams. However, as the last citation shows, a citation sentence, unlike news headlines, may cover no information about the target paper.
The use of phrasal information as nuggets is an es-sential element to our experiments, since some head-line writers often try to use uncommon terms to re-fer to a factoid. For instance, two headlines from the redsox cluster are:
Following these examples, we asked two anno-tators to annotate all 1 , 390 headlines, and 926 ci-tations. The annotators were asked to follow pre-cise guidelines in nugget extraction. Our guidelines instructed annotators to extract non-overlapping phrases from each headline as nuggets. Therefore, each nugget should be a substring of the headline that represents a semantic unit 4 .

Previously (Lin and Hovy, 2002) had shown that information overlap judgment is a difficult task for human annotators. To avoid such a difficulty, we enforced our annotators to extract non-overlapping nuggets from a summary to make sure that they are mutually independent and that information overlap between them is minimized.

Finding agreement between annotated well-defined nuggets is straightforward and can be cal-culated in terms of Kappa. However, when nuggets themselves are to be extracted by annotators, the task becomes less obvious. To calculate the agree-ment, we annotated 10 randomly selected head-line clusters twice and designed a simple evalua-tion scheme based on Kappa 5 . For each n -gram, w , in a given headline, we look if w is part of any nugget in either human annotations. If w occurs in both or neither, then the two annotators agree on it, and otherwise they do not. Based on this agreement setup, we can formalize the  X  statistic served agreement among annotators, and Pr ( e ) is the probability that annotators agree by chance if each annotator is randomly assigning categories.
Table 2 shows the unigram, bigram, and trigram-based average  X  between the two human annotators ( Human1 , Human2 ). These results suggest that human annotators can reach substantial agreement when bigram and trigram nuggets are examined, and has reasonable agreement for unigram nuggets. We study the diversity of ways with which human summarizers talk about the same story or event and explain why such a diversity exists. 4.1 Skewed Distributions Our first experiment is to analyze the popularity of different factoids. For each factoid in the annotated clusters, we extract its count, X , which is equal to the number of summaries it has been mentioned in, and then we look at the distribution of X . Fig-ure 1 shows the cumulative probability distribution for these counts (i.e., the probability that a factoid will be mentioned in at least c different summaries) in both categories.

These highly skewed distributions indicate that a large number of factoids (more than 28% ) are only mentioned once across different clusters (e.g.,  X  X oor pitching of colorado X  in the redsox cluster), and that a few factoids are mentioned in a large number of headlines (likely using different nuggets). The large number of factoids that are only mentioned in one headline indicates that different summarizers in-crease diversity by focusing on different aspects of a story or a paper. The set of nuggets also exhibit similar skewed distributions. If we look at individ-ual nuggets, the redsox set shows that about 63 (or 80% ) of the nuggets get mentioned in only one headline, resulting in a right-skewed distribution.
The factoid analysis of the datasets reveals two main causes for the content diversity seen in head-lines: (1) writers focus on different aspects of the story and therefore write about different factoids (e.g.,  X  X elebrations X  vs.  X  X oor pitching of col-orado X ). (2) writer use different nuggets to represent the same factoid (e.g.,  X  X edsox X  vs.  X  X osox X ). In the following sections we analyze the extent at which each scenario happens. 4.2 Factoid Inventory The emergence of diversity in covering different fac-toids suggests that looking at more summaries will capture a larger number of factoids. In order to ana-lyze the growth of the factoid inventory, we perform a simple experiment. We shuffle the set of sum-maries from all 25 clusters in each category, and then look at the number of unique factoids and nuggets seen after reading n th summary. This number shows the amount of information that a randomly selected subset of n writers represent. This is important to study in order to find out whether we need a large number of summaries to capture all aspects of a story and build a complete factoid inventory. The plot in Figure 4.1 shows, at each n , the number of unique factoids and nuggets observed by reading n random summaries from the 25 clusters in each cat-egory. These curves are plotted on a semi-log scale to emphasize the difference between the growth pat-terns of the nugget inventories and the factoid inven-tories 6 .

This finding numerically confirms a similar ob-servation on human summary annotations discussed in (van Halteren and Teufel, 2003; van Halteren and Teufel, 2004). In their work, van Halteren and Teufel indicated that more than 10-20 human sum-maries are needed for a full factoid inventory. How-ever, our experiments with nuggets of nearly 2 , 400 independent human summaries suggest that neither the nugget inventory nor the number of factoids will be likely to show asymptotic behavior. However, these plots show that the nugget inventory grows at a much faster rate than factoids. This means that a lot of the diversity seen in human summarization is a result of the so called different lexical choices that represent the same semantic units or factoids. 4.3 Summary Quality In previous sections we gave evidence for the diver-sity seen in human summaries. However, a more important question to answer is whether these sum-maries all cover important aspects of the story. Here, we examine the quality of these summaries, study the distribution of information coverage in them, and investigate the number of summaries required to build a complete factoid inventory.

The information covered in each summary can be determined by the set of factoids (and not nuggets) and their frequencies across the datasets. For exam-ple, in the redsox dataset,  X  X ed sox X ,  X  X oston X , and  X  X oston red sox X  are nuggets that all represent the same piece of information: the red sox team. There-fore, different summaries that use these nuggets to refer to the red sox team should not be seen as very different.

We use the Pyramid model (Nenkova and Pas-sonneau, 2004) to value different summary factoids. Intuitively, factoids that are mentioned more fre-quently are more salient aspects of the story. There-fore, our pyramid model uses the normalized fre-quency at which a factoid is mentioned across a dataset as its weight. In the pyramid model, the in-dividual factoids fall in tiers. If a factoid appears in more summaries, it falls in a higher tier. In princi-ple, if the term w i appears | w i | times in the set of headlines it is assigned to the tier T | w mid score that we use is computed as follows. Sup-pose the pyramid has n tiers, T i , where tier T n is the top tier and T 1 is the bottom. The weight of the factoids in tier T i will be i (i.e. they appeared in i summaries). If | T i | denotes the number of fac-toids in tier T i , and D i is the number of factoids in the summary that appear in T i , then the total factoid weight for the summary is D = P n i =1 i  X  D i . Ad-ditionally, the optimal pyramid score for a summary is Max = P n i =1 i  X | T i | . Finally, the pyramid score for a summary can be calculated as
Based on this scoring scheme, we can use the an-notated datasets to determine the quality of individ-ual headlines. First, for each set we look at the vari-ation in pyramid scores that individual summaries obtain in their set. Figure 3 shows, for each clus-ter, the variation in the pyramid scores (25th to 75th percentile range) of individual summaries evaluated against the factoids of that cluster. This figure in-dicates that the pyramid score of almost all sum-maries obtain values with high variations in most of the clusters For instance, individual headlines from redsox obtain pyramid scores as low as 0 . 00 and as high as 0 . 93 . This high variation confirms the pre-vious observations on diversity of information cov-erage in different summaries.

Additionally, this figure shows that headlines gen-erally obtain higher values than citations when con-sidered as summaries. One reason, as explained be-fore, is that a citation may not cover any important contribution of the paper it is citing, when headlines generally tend to cover some aspects of the story.
High variation in quality means that in order to capture a larger information content we need to read a greater number of summaries. But how many headlines should one read to capture a desired level of information content? To answer this question, we perform an experiment based on drawing random summaries from the pool of all the clusters in each category. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation, in which for each n , we draw n random summaries, and look at the pyramid score achieved by reading these headlines. The pyramid score is calculated us-ing the factoids from all 25 clusters in each cate-gory 7 . Each experiment is repeated 1 , 000 times to find the statistical significance of the experiment and the variation from the average pyramid scores.
Figure 4.3 shows the average pyramid scores over different n values in each category on a log-log scale. This figure shows how pyramid score grows and approaches 1 . 00 rapidly as more randomly se-lected summaries are seen. In previous sections we showed that the diversity seen in human summaries could be according to dif-ferent nuggets or phrases that represent the same fac-toid. Ideally, a summarizer that seeks to increase di-versity should capture this phenomenon and avoid covering redundant nuggets. In this section, we use different state of the art summarization systems to rank the set of summaries in each cluster with re-spect to information content and diversity. To evalu-ate each system, we cut the ranked list at a constant length (in terms of the number of words) and calcu-late the pyramid score of the remaining text. 5.1 Distributional Similarity We have designed a summary ranker that will pro-duce a ranked list of documents with respect to the diversity of their contents. Our model works based on ranking individual words and using the ranked list of words to rank documents that contain them.
In order to capture the nuggets of equivalent se-mantic classes, we use a distributional similarity of words that is inspired by (Lee, 1999). We represent each word by its context in the cluster and find the similarity of such contexts. Particularly, each word w i is represented by a bag of words, ` i , that have a surface distance of 3 or smaller to w i anywhere in the cluster. In other words, ` i contains any word that co-occurs with w i in a 4-gram in the cluster. This bag of words representation of words enables us to find the word-pair similarities.
We use the pair-wise similarities of words in each cluster, and build a network of words and their simi-larities. Intuitively, words that appear in similar con-texts are more similar to each other and will have a stronger edge between them in the network. There-fore, similar words, or words that appear in similar contexts, will form communities in this graph. Ide-ally, each community in the word similarity network would represent a factoid. To find the communities in the word network we use (Clauset et al., 2004), a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm which works by greedily optimizing the modularity in a linear running time for sparse graphs.

The community detection algorithm will assign to each word w i , a community label C i . For each community, we use LexRank to rank the words us-ing the similarities in Equation 1, and assign a score to each word w i as S ( w i ) = R i | C rank of w i in its community, and | C i | is the number of words that belong to C i . Figure 5.1 shows part of the word similarity graph in the redsox cluster, in which each node is color-coded with its commu-nity. This figure illustrates how words that are se-mantically related to the same aspects of the story fall in the same communities (e.g.,  X  X olice X  and  X  X r-rest X ). Finally, to rank sentences, we define the score of each document D j as the sum of the scores of its words.
Intuitively, sentences that contain higher ranked words in highly populated communities will have a smaller score. To rank the sentences, we sort them in an ascending order, and cut the list when its size is greater than the length limit. 5.2 Other Methods 5.2.1 Random
For each cluster in each category (citations and headlines), this method simply gets a random per-mutations of the summaries. In the headlines datasets, where most of the headlines cover some factoids about the story, we expect this method to perform reasonably well since randomization will increase the chances of covering headlines that fo-cus on different factoids. However, in the citations dataset, where a citing sentence may cover no infor-mation about the cited paper, randomization has the drawback of selecting citations that have no valuable information in them. 5.2.2 LexRank
LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004) works by first building a graph of all the documents ( D i ) in a cluster. The edges between corresponding nodes ( d i ) represent the cosine similarity between them is above a threshold (0.10 following (Erkan and Radev, 2004)). Once the network is built, the system finds the most central sentences by performing a random walk on the graph. 5.2.3 MMR
Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) uses the pairwise cosine simi-larity matrix and greedily chooses sentences that are the least similar to those already in the summary. In particular, where A is the set of documents in the summary, initialized to A =  X  . 5.2.4 DivRank
Unlike other time-homogeneous random walks (e.g., PageRank), DivRank does not assume that the transition probabilities remain constant over time. DivRank uses a vertex-reinforced random walk model to rank graph nodes based on a diversity based centrality. The basic assumption in DivRank is that the transition probability from a node to other is reinforced by the number of previous visits to the target node (Mei et al., 2010). Particularly, let X  X  as-sume p T ( u,v ) is the transition probability from any node u to node v at time T . Then, where N T ( d j ) is the number of times the walk has visited d j up to time T and
Here, p  X  ( d j ) is the prior distribution that deter-mines the preference of visiting vertex d j . We try two variants of this algorithm: DivRank , in which p ( d j ) is uniform, and DivRank with priors in which p  X  ( d j )  X  l ( D j )  X   X  , where l ( D j ) is the num-ber of the words in the document D j and  X  is a pa-rameter (  X  = 0 . 8 ). 5.2.5 C-LexRank
C-LexRank is a clustering-based model in which the cosine similarities of document pairs are used to build a network of documents. Then the the network is split into communities, and the most salient doc-uments in each community are selected (Qazvinian and Radev, 2008). C-LexRank focuses on finding communities of documents using their cosine simi-larity. The intuition is that documents that are more similar to each other contain similar factoids. We ex-pect C-LexRank to be a strong ranker, but incapable of capturing the diversity caused by using different phrases to express the same meaning. The reason is that different nuggets that represent the same factoid often have no words in common (e.g.,  X  X ictory X  and  X  X lory X ) and won X  X  be captured by a lexical measure like cosine similarity. 5.3 Experiments We use each of the systems explained above to rank the summaries in each cluster. Each ranked list is then cut at a certain length (50 words for headlines, and 150 for citations) and the information content in the remaining text is examined using the pyramid score.

Table 3 shows the average pyramid score achieved by different methods in each category. The method based on the distributional similarities of words out-performs other methods in the citations category. All methods show similar results in the headlines cate-gory, where most headlines cover at least 1 factoid about the story and a random ranker performs rea-sonably well. Table 4 shows top 3 headlines from 3 rankers: word distributional similarity (WDS), C-LexRank, and MMR. In this example, the first 3 headlines produced by WDS cover two important factoids:  X  X ed sox winning the title X  and  X  X ans cel-ebrating X . However, the second factoid is absent in the other two. Our experiments on two different categories of human-written summaries (headlines and citations) showed that a lot of the diversity seen in human summarization comes from different nuggets that may actually represent the same semantic informa-tion (i.e., factoids). We showed that the factoids ex-hibit a skewed distribution model, and that the size of the nugget inventory asymptotic behavior even with a large number of summaries. We also showed high variation in summary quality across different summaries in terms of pyramid score, and that the information covered by reading n summaries has a rapidly growing asymptotic behavior as n increases. Finally, we proposed a ranking system that employs word distributional similarities to identify semanti-cally equivalent words, and compared it with a wide range of summarization systems that leverage diver-sity.

In the future, we plan to move to content from other collective systems on Web. In order to gen-eralize our findings, we plan to examine blog com-ments, online reviews, and tweets (that discuss the same URL). We also plan to build a generation sys-tem that employs the Yule model (Yule, 1925) to de-termine the importance of each aspect (e.g. who, when, where, etc.) in order to produce summaries that include diverse aspects of a story.

Our work has resulted in a publicly available dataset 8 of 25 annotated news clusters with nearly 1 , 400 headlines, and 25 clusters of citation sen-tences with more than 900 citations. We believe that this dataset can open new dimensions in studying di-versity and other aspects of automatic text genera-tion.
