 Ontologies X  X n explicit specification of a conceptualization [1] X  X acilitate knowledge sharing and semantic interoperability between different systems. However, in the Semantic Web environment, data come from different ontologies, and information processing across ontologies is impossible without knowing the semantic mappings between them. Ontology alignment or ontology mapping[2-4]establishes relationships them. Most available approaches used local or /and non-local contexts of entities within between ontologies are helpful for computing the semantic similarity between different ontology entities. 
For example, suppose two ontologies Mid-Level-Ontology provides much heuristic information to align In this article, we focus on aligning ontologies utilizing the relations between them. The goal of our approach is not to provide a complete solution to automated ontology alignment but rather to augment existing methods by determining additional possible points of semantic similarity between ontology entitiese. To begin with, we propose a hierarchical ontology model (HOM) to express the relation between ontologies formally. Based on HOM, we present an algorithm HOM-Matching, which utilizes obtaining LUBC (Least Upper Bound Concept) of entity pair; 3) identifying different partition of the revised tracks of concepts; 4) computing external structure similarity. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related works. The hierarchical ontology model is expounded in section 3. The detail of HOM-Matching is Finally conclusion was made in section 6. In different context, there are different methods to compute similarity during ontology alignment. J. Euzenat etc.[2] classified them as six categories, namely terminological, internal structure comparison, external structure comparison, extensional comparison and semantic comparison. related to the classes in question. External structure comparison compares the relations graph, and matches conceptual graphs by comparing super-classes and subclasses. Steffen Staab[8] computes the dissimilarity between two taxonomies by comparing for provided by the users as a partial alignment. Anchor-PROMPT takes as input a set of anchors X  X airs of related terms defined by the user or automatically identified by lexical matching. Anchor-PROMPT treated ontology as a graph which represents classes as nodes and slots as links. The algorithm analyzes the paths in the sub-graph limited by the anchors, and determines which classes frequently appear in similar positions on similar paths. These classes are likely to represent semantically similar concepts. To align two representations of anatomy at the lexical and structural level, Songmao Zhang[10] presented a novel method. They considered alignment consists of the structurally. Their method aligned the representations using the shared concepts. 
Bernstein and colleagues created the SimPack framework[11] that uses a set of similarity measures to calculate the similarity of different concepts. SemMF[12] describes three kinds of concept matching techniques implemented: the string matcher, taxonomic matcher computes the similarity between two concepts c1 and c2 based on distance. Mark Hefke and colleagues[13] present the conceptual basis and a prototypical implementation of a software framework for syntactical and semantic similarities between ontology instances. They calculated the taxonomic similarity of two instances by looking at the relative taxonomic position of the concepts of the regarded instances. 
HOM-Matching, which we present here, complements these approaches by analyzing the relations between aligned ontologies, and by providing additional suggestions for possible matching terms. Category theory, which is independent of special model and language, is a useful tools (HOM), which formally describes the relations between ontologies sharing same imported ontologies, with category theory firstly. First of all, we give the definition of ontology formally. It is obvious that C C HR  X  . Therefore we denote ontology as 3-tuple :(, ,) O = C CR A unless focusing on hierarchy Definition 2 Ontology Model (OM). Ontology Model is a tuple :(, ) OM = O OR , where: O is the set of ontologies used in the model; ROO is binary relations on O . We take hierarchical relation H R into account.  X  HO RR , which is defined as follows. 1 (, , ) O (1)  X  12 CC (3)  X  66 12 AFAF from Axiom 2 A . Definition 4 Hierarchical Ontology Model (HOM). :(, ) HOM = H OR is a hierarchical ontology model, if H R are the relation defined as definition 3. Definition 5 Common Ancestor (CA). Given two ontologies 1 (, , ) O = 2 (, , ) O share imported ontologies of 12 , OO . Definition 6 Least Upper Bound Concept of Concept Pair ( LUBC ) . Given a pair of concepts, 1 C in 1 (, , , ) O = , CC is the concept that satisfying following conditions: (2) Taking LUBC into account, we revise the definition of Track of concept. 4.1 Additional Definitions Before giving the algorithm of computing similarity, we present some related definitions in addition. Definition 7 Track of Concept. Given a concept C in ( , , , ) O = C in 1 O is 1 , , ,','', CCaCbCC Cr . Taking LUBC into account, we revise the definition of Track of concept. Definition 8 Revised Track of Concept. Given a pair of concepts 12 , CC , the revised context shown as figure 1, the revised track of 1 C with 2 C is 1 ,,,' CCaCbC . As shown in figure 1, the revised track is partitioned into two parts: revised Track in LCA, whose element is defined by LCA originally; and revised Track out LCA, the rest 
Computing external structure similarity between entities is based on the position of follows the graph distance. And M X dche and Zacharias P [13] P described the upward cotopy distance for computing the similarity between entities. These measures can be applied as such in the context of ontology alignment since the ontologies are supposed to share where the similarity is calculated based on the path. distances ( , ) c dCLUBC are calculated with: 1(,)0 Sim C C &gt;&gt; , the parameters X  scope are set as implies that the semantic distance between concept and LUBC increases and semantic similarity decreases with the length of revised track of concepts. 4.2 Algorithm In this section, we proposed the related algorithm for computing the similarity using LUBC. Figure 2 shows the detail of the algorithm. Algorithm 2. Computing distance between two entities within ontology The algorithm computes the Tracks of the concepts respectively. Then LUBC and LCA of concept pair are calculated. Based on these, the distances between concepts and LUBC are accumulated along the revised track of the concept respectively. Finally, we get the similarity across ontologies based on these distances. Our approach is to facilitate ontology alignment and improve its performance. In this section, we conduct two groups of experiments to validate our algorithm X  X  efficiency and optimize the parameters of our algorithms. 5.1 Measure and Evaluation Scenarios alignment: Precision is the ratio of correct found mappings to found mappings; Recall is the ratio of correct found mappings to existing mappings; F-Measure is harmonic means of recall, as may be necessary for specific use cases, slight changes would be necessary. 
When evaluating the performance of ontology alignment, we aggregate different local semantic similarities, including terminological similarity with and without lexicon; further with the help of Java WordNet library (JWNL) [20] , the terminological similarity (Sim TM ) is computed; the internal structure comparison compares (Sim IS ) the properties of classes, include properties X  name, rang and domain. The external structure similarity these local similarities: 
Sim C C Sim C C Sim C C Sim C C Sim C C  X  X   X  X  =+ ++ where 1234 ,,,  X  X   X  X  are the weights and 1234 1  X  X   X  X  +++ = .

In first group experiments, where different weights assignments for different local two pair ontologies, BibTeX/MIT and ATO-Mission/ ATO-Task. ATO-Mission/ ATO-Task sharing same imported ontologies come from SUO ontology library. BibTeX/MIT, provided for the alignment contest I3Con, is independent ontologies. 
In our algorithm, the parameters 12 ,  X  X  impact the performance of ontology experiments, where we align ATO-Mission/ ATO-Task only and assign weights for getting in first group experiments. These experiments show the relation between 12 ,  X  X  and the performance of ontology alignment. 5.2 Results and Discussion In our experiments, we prune the available mappings by n-percent method [13] . In this method, the mapping whose global similarity is over the cut-off value are preserved and the cut-off value is defined by taking the highest similarity value of all and subtracting a fixed percentage from it. In our experiments, the fixed percentage is set to 50%. 
The experimental results are shown as figure 4. Figure 4 (a) show the relation between of ontology alignment while aligning the ontology sharing imported ontologies. 
From those experimental results, we get following conclusions: 1) While aligning ontologies not sharing same imported ontologies, HOM-Matching 2) Assigned appropriate weight (about 0.4), the F-Measures of ontology alignment 3) While aligning ontologies shared imported ontologies, assigning proper weights 
In our approach, if 12  X  X  = , and 12 OO = , the similarity measure equals the computing semantic similarity between entities from different ontologies. employ different ontologies. High-quality al ignment between ontologies is a necessary Ontologies describing the same or relevant domain share same imported ontologies in most situations in Semantic web. We pro pose a hierarchical ontology model (HOM) to make the relation between ontologies explicit. Basing on HOM, HOM-Matching entities. The experimental results show that HOM-Matching improves the performance share imported ontologies. semantic distance between entities in different context. Further, we will use the obtained alignment to discover and match web service semantically in multiple-ontology environment.
