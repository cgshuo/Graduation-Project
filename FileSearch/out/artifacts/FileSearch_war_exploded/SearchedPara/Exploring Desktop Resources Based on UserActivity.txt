 Relocation in personal desktop resources is an interesting and promising research topic. This demonstration illustrates a new perspective in exploring desktop resources to help users re-find expected data resources more effectively. Dif-ferent from existing works, our prototype OrientSpace has two features: automatically extract and maintain user tasks to support task-based exploration, and support vague search by exploiting associations between desktop resources.

 General Terms: Design, Human Factors, Management. Keywords: Desktop resources, Task exploration, Associa-tion exploration.
Nowadays, the most widely used approaches to explore desktop resources is by Windows Resource Explorer(WRE) and Desktop Search Tools(DST). WRE demands users to recall precise path information, and DST demands users to remember exact key words. However, there X  X e many occa-sions when users can not remember the promising keywords or pathes. In fact, users often expect to relocate desktop resources based on user tasks( [1],etc). Some existing works make good efforts to tackle this problem, like prototype Haystack [2] and Phlat [3]. But these works paid little atten-tion to the role of user activities for personal data relocation. This demonstration is try to overcome the disadvantages of the extisting works, and help users to explorer personal desk-top resources based user activities and associations between desktop resources.
Figure 1 shows the interface of OrientSpace system. It has two major features: task-based resources exploration and association-based resources exploration.

Task-based Resource Exploration. In this work we de-fine each task as a set of desktop files related to generating a special personal document, and identify each task based on analyzing user access sequential list on desktop resources. The left area of figure 1 shows a list of user tasks ranked by time, which are extracted automatically through detecting
