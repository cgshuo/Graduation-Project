 1. Introduction
With recent growth of the internet systems, many document retrieval systems have been developed and a retrieval ( Fukumoto &amp; Suzuki, 1996 ), passage retrieval ( Callen, 1994; Iwayama &amp; Tokunaga, 1999; that can be used in human communication ( Kawabe &amp; Matsumoto, 1998; Tsuji, Nigazawa, Okada, &amp; Aoe, on specific words in that document. For example, people who encounter the words  X  X  election  X  X  or  X  X  home run  X  X  can recognize the document super-field  X  Politics  X  or sub-field  X  Baseball  X  .
Field Association ( FA ) word is a minimum word which cannot be divided without losing semantic mean-sub-field  X  Baseball  X  .

Some keywords appear frequently in texts and relate strongly to text topics. Ohkubo, Sugizaki, Inoue, and Tanaka (1998) proposed a method to estimate information that users might need for analyzing login data on a WWW search engine. By that method, word groups connected with search words change due to time series variation; for example, new sport personalities and new words related to fashion can appear periodically (e.g. every year).

The research documented in this paper focuses on finding new FA words automatically. To do so, a large quantity of document data for building FA word candidates is necessary. This paper presents a system for automatically building FA words by adding new FA word candidates which change over time to an FA word dictionary. This new system uses a WWW search engine to extract FA word candidates from document data for each field. These candidates are automatically compared with FA words already in a dictionary of FA words . Then, new FA words can be added to a dictionary of FA words .

Section 2 introduces FA words , field systems, and FA word levels. Section 3 explains a system for auto-matically building new FA word candidates and explains document corpus collection. Section 4 introduces sents a conclusion and indicates possible future work. 2. Field Association words, field trees and levels 2.1. Field Association words
In this study, compound FA words (e.g. nuclear weapon , consumption tax or global warming ) are consid-ered to be simple FA words because document field information is easily lost when those compound FA words are divided. Proper nouns (e.g. Atlanta Braves , Oakland Athletics and South Africa ) and personal names (e.g. Sammy Sosa , Carlos Delgado ) are considered to be simple FA words . Proper nouns containing ing to document field  X  Baseball  X  , but on different levels. 2.2. Document field trees
Document field trees represent ranked relationships connecting document fields ( Aoe, Morita, &amp; Moc-ment field tree is a terminal document field and other nodes are medium document fields. In this study, a and in such cases only terminal fields are indicated. FA words and paths are manually ranked. For example, and document field  X  Swimming  X  . 2.3. FA word levels ciate FA words to document fields. To decide levels, the following algorithm can be used. tration ratio of word w in field  X  S  X  can be expressed: where  X  S 0  X  is the super-field of  X  S  X  .

The number of corpus files in each field varies, so the number of extracted FA word candidates also var-ies. Therefore, the frequency of w in field  X  S  X  is regulated using total frequency T : Step 1: Perfect -FA words (Level 1) If root =  X  S  X  and sub-field =  X  S n C  X  of the field tree, the condition equation enters step 2.
 Step 2: Imperfect -FA words (Level 2) and Super -FA words (Level 3) the following equation: to be a super-FA word (Level 3) of field  X  S  X  .
 Step 3: Multiple-FA words (Level 4) imperfect-FA word and a super-FA word according to the Step 1 and Step 2.
 Sample decision of an FA word using the above algorithm is as follows:
Example 1. Decision process of FA word candidate  X  X  X ome run X  X  ( concentration ratio = 0.9 ) ( Process 1 ) Judging whether or not  X  X  X ome run X  X  is an FA word of  X  SPORTS  X  Super-field =  X  All fields  X  ; Sub-field =  X  SPORTS  X  From Fig. 1 :
Step 1 is repeated, taking  X  SPORTS  X  as the super-field. ( Process 2 ) Judging whether or not  X  X  home run  X  X  is an FA word of  X  SPORTS n Ball Game  X  Super-field =  X  SPORTS  X  ; Sub-field =  X  Ball Game  X  From Fig. 1 :
Step 1 is repeated, taking  X  Ball Game  X  as the super-field. ( Process 3 ) Judging whether or not  X  X  X ome run X  X  is an FA word of  X  SPORTS n Ball Game n Baseball  X  Super-field =  X  Ball Game  X  ; Sub-field =  X  Baseball  X  From Fig. 1 : field, the judgment is finished.
Example 2. Decision process of FA word candidate  X  X  doubles  X  X  ( concentration ratio = 0.9 ) ( Process 1 ) Judging whether or not  X  X  doubles  X  X  is an FA word of  X  SPORTS  X  Super-field =  X  All fields  X  ; Sub-field =  X  SPORTS  X  From Fig. 2 : peated, taking  X  SPORTS  X  as the super-field. ( Process 2 ) Judging whether or not  X  X  doubles  X  X  is an FA word for  X  SPORTS n Ball Game  X  : Super-field =  X  SPORTS  X  ; Sub-field =  X  Ball Game  X 
Step 1 is repeated, taking  X  Ball Game  X  as the super-field. ( Process 3 ) Judging whether or not  X  X  doubles  X  X  is an FA word for  X  SPORTS n Ball Game n Tennis  X  Super-field =  X  Ball Game  X  ; Sub-field =  X  Tennis  X  From Fig. 2 : process enters Step 2. calculated:
Fields which have frequency for word  X  X  doubles X  X  higher than this average (12.7) are  X  Tennis  X  with fre-quency = 204 and  X  Table Tennis  X  with frequency = 46, so the condition equation becomes: minal fields, so the judgment is finished.

Level 3 and Level 4 can be decided by the above algorithm. 3. Automatic building of FA words 3.1. System outline
To retrieve document data, a word from an existing FA word dictionary is used as a reference keyword tree. FA words are decided from words which are associated with specific fields. New FA word candidates are appended to the dictionary of FA words by comparison with FA words already listed in that dictionary.
To decide FA word candidates requires a large collection of documents and a WWW search engine quickly retrieves document data. Generally, a search engine text document has tables and images, but this system requires only document data. Useless line feed and blanks are also cut from document data. Fig. 4 shows some filtered document data.
 4. Experiment evaluation 4.1. Data
Word collection data are used for experimental data and there are 59,161 words and 4.52 MB document data from a data set of 20 Newsgroup from CNN Web Site (1996 X 2003). Concentration ratio is changed from 0.5 X 0.9 to decide the levels of FA word candidates.

In Fig. 5 (a), field  X  Information  X  has many FA words compared with other fields because  X  Information  X  has many sub-fields compared to other fields. Fig. 5 (b) shows the number of relevant FA words in some vant number of FA words than in other sub-fields because of the uniqueness of the words in these sub-fields. 4.2. System evaluation Precision and Recall used to evaluate this system are defined:
If the number of extracted FA words equals the number of decided fields, the FA words are considered to be relevant. P and R are explained by Table 1(a) which shows some extracted FA words and Table 1(b) which shows some relevant FA words . All extracted FA words are level 1.

There are 11 extracted FA words as in Table 1(a) and 10 relevant FA words as in Table 1(b) . The relevant and Precision are: where the total relevant FA words are 10: This result shows that P = 1 and R = 1 when the number of extracted FA words and the number of relevant
FA words are identical and related to the same fields. P = 1 and R &lt; 1, when the number of extracted FA
R = 1 when the number of extracted FA words is higher than the number of relevant FA words and all rel-words than relevant FA words and all relevant FA words are not included in the extracted FA words . 4.3. Experiment simulation results
Fig. 6 shows the number of extracted FA words on each level. Based on different concentration ratios, the number of extracted FA words of Level 1 is higher than the number of extracted FA words of Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4. Moreover, the number of extracted FA words of Level 1 increases as concentration ratios decrease.

Conversely, the number of extracted FA words on Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 decreases with decrease in concentration ratios. Therefore, when the ratio is high, FA words of Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 are ex-tracted and when the ratio is low, FA words of Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 become FA words of Level to measure because FA words on those levels exist in more than one field.

Table 2 shows that our systems selected 38,372 of FA words candidates from 59,161 words of document data and automatic appended from them 16,761 new FA words to existence FA word dictionary. From
Table 2 , we notice that the automatically appended number of FA word using Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 are: 16,761 (44%). This means that our new system can automatically appended around 44% of new FA words to the existence FA word dictionary.

Fig. 7 (a) shows number of extracted FA words and number of relevant FA words .In Fig. 7 (a), the num-ber of extracted FA words increases with decrease of the concentration ratios and the number of extracted FA words which are relevant FA words increases too.
 0.9 is 0.935 but R of concentration ratio 0.5 slightly increases to 0.956. This mean that, the number of extracted FA words increases at concentration ratio 0.9 but relevant FA words which could not be extracted at concentration ratio 0.9 could be extracted at concentration ratio 0.5.

P values decrease with decrease in concentration ratios. P at concentration ratio 0.9 is 0.744 but P at the number of relevant FA words increases as the number of extracted FA words increases.
Fig. 7 (b) shows the efficiency of document data set on R and P . R is almost constant as concentration ratios change, however P decreases with decrease of concentration ratios. Also, the number of relevant FA one. However, accurate relevant FA words are needed for the system design to build FA words automati-effective for that propose. 5. Conclusion
With increasing popularity of the Internet and tremendous amount of on-line text, automatic document classification is important for organizing huge amounts of data. Moreover, document fields can be decided efficiently if there are many FA words and if the frequency rate is high. A WWW search engine retrieved keywords from document corpora. Words were extracted from those document corpora to get FA word candidates. Furthermore, new FA word candidates were appended to an FA word dictionary by comparing these words automatically with FA words already in that dictionary. From the experiential results, our new system can be automatically appended around 44% of new FA words to the existence FA word dictionary. matic building of FA words with Passage retrieval.
