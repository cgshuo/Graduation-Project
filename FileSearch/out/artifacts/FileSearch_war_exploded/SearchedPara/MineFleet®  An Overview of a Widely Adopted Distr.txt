 This paper describes the Mi neFleet X  distributed vehicle performance data mining system designed for commercial fleets. MineFleet analyzes high throughput data streams onboard the vehicle, generates the analytics, sends those to the remote server over the wide-area wireless networks and offers them to the fleet managers using stand-alone and web-based user-interface. The paper describes the overall archit ecture of the system, business needs, and shares experience from successful large-scale commercial deployments. MineFleet is probably one of the first commercially successful distributed data stream mining systems. This patented technology has been adopted, productized, and commercially offered by many large companies in the mobile resource management and GPS fleet tracking industry. This paper offers an overview of the system and offers a detailed analysis of what made it work.

 Vehicle data stream mining, dist ributed data mining, telematics. is producing a growing variety of devices that process different types of data using limited compu ting and storage resources with varying levels of connectivity through wireless communication networks. The rich source of da ta from the ubiquitous components of businesses, mechanical devices , and our daily lives offers the exciting possibility of a new generation of data intensive applications for distributed a nd mobile environments. Mining distributed data streams in a ubi quitous environment is one such possibility. Several years of research on distributed data mining [1, 2, 3, 5, 7] and data stream mining have produced a reasonably powerful collection of algorithms and system-architectures that can be used for developing se veral interesting classes of distributed applications for light weight wireless applications. In fact an increasing number of such systems [4, 6] are being reported in the literature. Some commercial systems are also starting to appear. This paper reports the development of MineFleet X , a novel mobile and distributed data mi ning application for monitoring vehicle data streams in real-time. MineFleet is designed for monitoring commercial vehicle fleets using onboard embedded data stream mining systems and other remote modules connected through wireless networks in a distributed environment. MineFleet is a powerful data stream mining software for modeling, benchmarking, and m onitoring of vehicle health, emissions, driver behavior, fuel-consumption, and fleet characteristics. Consider a nationwide grocery delivery system which operates a large fleet of trucks. Regular main tenance of the vehicles in such fleets is an important part of the supply chain management and normally commercial fleet management companies get the responsibility of maintaining the fleet. Fleet maintenance companies usually spend a good deal of time and labor in collecting vehicle performance data, studying the data offline, and estimating the condition of the vehicle primarily through manual efforts. Fleet management companies are also usually interested in studying the driving characteristics for a variety of reasons (e.g. policy enforcement, insurance, Department of Transportation regulations). Monitoring fuel cons umption, vehicle emissions, and identifying how vehicle parameters can be optimized to get better fuel economy are some additional reasons that support ample return of investment (ROI) for systems like MineFleet. The MineFleet is widely adopted in the mobile resource management and fleet management industry. Similar applications also arise in monitoring the health of airplanes and space vehicles [9, 10, 11]. There is a strong need for real-time on-board monitoring and mining of data (e .g. flight systems performance data, weather data, radar data about other planes). -------------------------------------------------------*Protected by Patented Technology; ** Also affiliated with the CSEE department, University of Maryland, Baltimore County. The main unique characteristics of the MineFleet system that distinguish it from traditional data mining systems are as follows: Section 2 presents the business motivation. Section 3 compares MineFleet with existing vehicle telematics systems. Section 4 offers an overview of the MineFleet system architecture. Section 5 describes the Predictive Health Monitoring capabilities of the MineFleet system. Section 6 di scusses the Fuel Consumption Analysis module. Section 7 offers an overview of the Driver Behavior Monitoring module. Sec tion 8 discusses the Emissions Monitoring capabilities of the MineFleet system. Section 9 discusses how MineFleet penetr ated the market and achieved wide-spread adoption. It also o ffers a perspective of how the business ecosystem evolved and shares some of the experiences in placing a new distributed data mi ning product in a new vertical not quite familiar with the data mining technology. Finally, Section 10 concludes the paper. The success of MineFleet is f undamentally based on a strong business case. There are approximately 25 million commercial vehicles in North America al one and about 250 million passenger vehicles in US only. So the total market size is fairly substantial. Vehicles generate ample data. However, accessing the data, particularly the ones specific to different manufacturers, is a non-trivial issue from the know-how perspective since many of these parameters are not publicly available. Upon access to the data, there are many useful things that can be done (e.g. detect potential health problems, optimize fuel economy, achieve proper driving performance, and emissions reducti ons) by using advanced data mining techniques. This also im plies that any investment to achieve extensive access to the vehicle performance data from different manufacturers is likely to create natural protection by limiting quick-market entry by other competitive entities. There are many other challenges. Fi rst of all, vehicles generate high throughput data streams. M onitoring hundreds of different sub-system parameters over coupl e of hours may easily generate several mega bytes of data a nd transmitting this data over the wireless network is a non-trivial challenge. One of the main reasons is that most fleet owners do not appear to be willing to pay for a wireless data plan mo re than 5MB per month or so. Moreover, most of the fleets that opt for advanced vehicle performance data mining capabilities also require tracking and navigation related capabilities. As a result the data transmission is further constrained. This requi res exploring the other option---onboard analysis of the vehicle performance data and transmission of the results to the server over the wireless network. This problem is even more seri ous for long distance trucks and off-the road equipments that ma ke use of satellite-based wireless communication networks instead of the land-based cellular networks. Note that the satellite-based wireless communication networks are considerably more expensive compared to their land-based counterparts. Commercial fleets are usually comprised of large number of vehicles. These fleets are usua lly segmented among a set of different groups of vehicles of sa me type. Fleets also have drivers and the overall efficiency of the fleet depends on the driver behavior. Therefore, just analysis of the vehicle performance data onboard the vehicle is not enough. Comparing and contrasting the performances of different vehicl es and drivers is also very important. Moreover, the embedded devices placed onboard the vehicles are often inexpensive and resource-cons trained. For example, typical GPS tracking devices that are deployed in large commercial fleets would be based on 8-bit microcontrollers or 32-bit processors with limited storage. As a resu lt, the onboard devices cannot be relatively short-term analysis shoul d be sent and aggregated at the server for long term modeling, trend-analysis, and outlier detection. MineFleet X  X  business case relies upon these observations. It is based on the distributed data mini ng technology that is driven by the following capabilities: The following section discusses related work. MineFleet is a real-time distributed vehicle performance monitoring system. To the best of our knowledge this is the first distributed data mining system for commercial fleet monitoring. However, it builds on the existing work on vehicle telematics. Existing vehicle telematics systems collect vehicle performance data and offer them to the fleet managers or vehicle owners. OnStar 1 for General Motors vehicles and Sync 2 from Ford are examples of such telematics systems. There are some major differences between the MineFleet and traditional telematics systems. Some of them are listed below: www.onstar.com http://www.fordvehicles.com/technology/sync/ These unique aspects of the MineFleet distinguish itself from the conventional tracking/navigation and telematic services. The following section offers an overview of the MineFleet architecture. Figure 1. MineFleet architecture.  X  Copyright, Agnik, LLC.
 MineFleet X  is a mobile and di stributed data stream mining environment where the resource-constrained "small" computing devices need to perform various non-trivial data management and mining tasks on-board a vehicle in real-time. MineFleet analyzes the data produced by the various sensors present in most modern vehicles. It continuously monitors data streams generated by a moving vehicle using an on-board computing device, identifies the emerging patterns, and if necessary reports these patterns to a remote control center over lo w-bandwidth wireless network connection. MineFleet also offers different distributed data mining capabilities for detecting fleet-level patterns across the different vehicles in the fleet. This section presents a brief overview of the architecture of the system and the functionalities of its different modules. The current implementation of MineFleet analyzes and monitors only the data generated by th e vehicle's on-board diagnostic system and sometimes the Gl obal Positioning System (GPS). MineFleet Onboard is designe d for embedded in-vehicle computing devices, tablet PCs, and cell-phones. The overall conceptual process diagram of the system is shown in Figure 1. The MineFleet system is comprised of several important components that are briefly described in the following sections. MineFleet Onboard module is comp rised of the computing device that hosts the software to analyze the vehicle-performance data and the interface that connects the computing device with the vehicle data bus. Figure 2 show s the MineFleet Onboard Data Mining platform (MF-DMP101) de vice that hosts the MineFleet Onboard software. MineFleet also runs on many different types of embedded devices, in-vehicle-tab let-PCs, laptops, cell-phones and other types of handheld devices. Se veral other hardware platforms (e.g. DMP-201 from Agnik and other third-party vendors) are also currently available for running MineFleet Onboard. 
Figure 2. MineFleet Data Mining Platform (MF-DMP101) that hosts the MineFleet Onboard software.  X  Copyright, This module manages the incoming data streams from the vehicle, analyzes the data using various st atistical and data stream mining algorithms, and manages the transmission of the resulting analytics to the remote server. Th is module also triggers actions whenever unusual activities are observed. It connects to the MineFleet Server located at a data center through a wireless network. The system allows the fleet managers to monitor and analyze vehicle performance, driver behavior, emissions quality, and fuel consumption characteristics remotely without necessarily downloading all the data to the remote central monitoring station over the expensive wireless connection. The MineFleet Server is in charge of receiving all the analytics from different vehicles, managing those analytics, and further processing them as appropriate. The MineFleet Server supports the following main operations: (i) interacting with the on-board module for remote management , monitoring, and mining of vehicle data streams and (ii) managing interaction with the MineFleet Web Services. It also offers a whole range of fleet-management related services that are not directly related to the main focus of this paper. The Serv er is connected with a relational database management system where it stores the analytics received from the vehicles in th e fleet. All the onboard diagnostic, provisioning, and updates are perfo rmed over-the-air. Using an easy-to-use web-based interface, members of the support team from Agnik and its resellers perfo rm these over-the-air operations. This module offers a web-br owser-based interface for the MineFleet analytics. It also offers a rich class of API functions for accessing the MineFleet analytics which in turn can be integrated with third-party applications. Figure 4 shows one of the interfaces of the MineFleet Web Services. Mi neFleet is currently offered by many vendors that have alread y integrated their web-based mobile resource management pr oduct with the MineFleet web-services. This module plays an important ro le in the implementation of the privacy policies. This module manages the specific policies regarding what can be monitored and what cannot be. It also allows the Fleet manager to create an environment where the MineFleet technology can be us ed for saving money, sharing benefits without violating the privacy of the drivers. MineFleet offers ROI on many diffe rent fronts. For example, the driver behavior monitoring analy tics offer direct ROI by reducing idling resulting in reduced emi ssion and fuel consumption and reducing hard braking resulting in less frequent brake shoe replacement. Wireless emissions monitoring eliminates the need to send the vehicle to the Smog test center saving around $200 per vehicle. Fuel consumption anal ysis improves gas mileage by identifying sub-optimal conditions of vehicle systems such as O2 sensor. Based on the data from many fleets that have been running MineFleet, several case studi es have been generated. It appears that MineFleet offers at least about 4-5% reduction in the fleet monthly operating costs. This is a significant ROI for the commercial fleet monitoring and mobile workforce management vertical. Detailed ROI analysis and ROI calculators are also available. In order to monitor the vehicle data streams using the on-board data management and mining module we need continuous computation of several statistics. For example, the MineFleet On-board system has a module that continuously monitors the spectral signature of the data which requires computation of covariance and correlation matrices on a regular basis. The on-board driving behavior character ization module requires frequent computation of similarity/distance matrices for data clustering and monitoring the operating regimes. Since the data are usually high dimensional, computation of the correlation matrices or distance (e.g. inner product, Euclidean) ma trices is difficult to perform using their conventional al gorithmic implementations. The incoming data sampling rate supported by the vehicle data bus limits the amount of time we get for processing the observed data. This usually means that we have only a few seconds to quickly analyze the data using the on-board-hardware (e.g. the MF-DMP101 device). If our algorithms take more time than what we have in hand, we cannot catch up with the incoming data rate. In order to handle this situation, we need to address the following issues: In order to illustrate the idea, consider the problem of monitoring the correlation matrices little more closely. Given an m x n data matrix U with m observations and n features, the correlation matrix is computed by U T U assuming that the columns of U are normalized to have zero mean and unit variance. A straight forward approach to compute the correlation matrix using matrix multiplication takes O(m.n 2 ) multiplications which is computationally very expensiv e. MineFleet deploys fast probabilistic algorithms to detect changes in the correlation matrices that are based on the observation that the sum of squared values of the elements in the co rrelation matrix that are above the represents the correlation coefficient between j 1 --th and j columns of the data matrix U. Using this observation, one can design a divide and conquer algorithm for searching in the space of correlation coefficients for detecting significantly changed correleation coefficients. More discussion on some of these algorithms can be found elsewhere [5]. MineFleet is powered by many such advanced stream mining algorithms designed to run in a re source-constrained environment. MineFleet makes use of distribut ed data mining algorithms that reply upon such advanced onboard data analysis techniques and aggregation of the resulting analytics at the server. This paper does not discuss the algorithmic issues. Rather it focuses on the functional capabilities and business case analysis. The following section describes one of th e key capabilities of MineFleet---Predictive Health Monitoring. This section provides insight into the vehicle health monitoring module of the MineFleet system. Predictive vehicle health monitoring is very important in many fleets since breakdown of a vehicle on the road is often very expensive because of the Predictive health monitoring in cars usually involves processing multitude of information available from the diagnostic data bus and possibly correlating that with maintenance data. This includes collecting diagnostic trouble code s, malfunction indicator light-data, and analyzing a large number of parameters available through the diagnostic data port. Typically, sensors in the vehicle s ubsystems generate two types of data. The observed operation conditions that are relatively independent variables and the de pendent features that change behavior in response to the changes in the operating condition variables. Examples of ope rating condition variables in conventional automobiles include the following: Barometric Pressure, Calculated Engine Load(%), Engine Coolant Temperature ( X F), Engine Speed (RPM), Engine Torque, Intake Air Temperature (IAT) ( X F), Mass Air Flow Sensor 1(MAF) (lbs/min), Start Up Engine Coolant Temp. ( X F), Start Up Intake Air Temperature ( X F), Throttle Position Sensor (%) , Throttle Position Sensor (degree), Vehicle Speed (Miles/Hour), and Odometer (Miles). There are also many other features that depend on the operating conditions. Examples from the fuel sub-system include Air Fuel Ratio, Fuel Level Sensor (%), Fuel System Status Bank 1 [Categ. Attrib.], Oxygen Sensor Bank 1 Sensor 1 [mV], Oxygen Sensor Bank 1 Sensor 2 (mV), Oxygen Sensor Bank 2 Sensor 1 (mV), Oxygen Sensor Bank 2 Sensor 2 (mV), Long Term Fuel Trim Bank 1 (%), Short Term Fuel Trim Bank 1(%) , Idle Air Control Motor Position, Injector Pulse Width #1 (msec), and Manifold Absolute Pressure (Hg). Since operating conditions for a co mplex vehicle can be diverse, segmenting the distribution of values can be effective. Once the data is segmented into different regimes, models for each one of the regimes should be develope d for the different regimes. 
Figure 5. Example of a vehicle he alth test designed based on MineFleet performs a large numbe r of health tests onboard the vehicle and if any of the tests fail MineFleet would report that to the server along with its recommended severity level. Figure 5 shows one such example. MineFleet also assigns a health score to each vehicle by aggregating the results of the health tests performed over a certain period of time. Figure 6 shows the interface for identifying the vehicles with poor health score using a heat-map like interface. Red zones represent vehicles with poor health scores. User can easily click on those regions in order to dig up more information about those troubling vehicles. A tabular view of the vehicle-health scores is also available in MineFleet. Figure 6. The vehicle health score visualization interface in MineFleet. The color coded heatmap interface allows the fleet manager to quickly identify th e vehicles with poor health Figure 7 shows the interface for a module that analyzes the vehicle maintenance data and links that with the vehicle diagnostic data. The goal is to detect unusual patterns in the vehicle maintenance operations and identify their reasons. The MineFleet fuel consumption analysis module offers many unique capabilities to compute the fuel economy of a vehicle/fleet, perform trend analysis of various kinds, and correlate that with various vehicle and driver performance parameters. Figure 8. Variation of Mass Air Flow with respect to Engine Typical vehicle fuel subsystems are high dimensional and modeling the data onboard the vehi cle requires feature selection based on domain knowledge and representation construction using various techniques such an eigen analysis and other orthogonal transformations. For example, consider Figure 8 which shows the variation of mass air flow with respect to engine speed and engine load. The relationship is fairly non-linear. A comprehensive analysis of the fuel subsystem would typically require including many additional parameters. As a result, near orthogonal transformations similar ity-preserving transformations are often very useful. Figure 9 shows the transformation of the data in Figure 8 in the eigenspace. Figure 10 shows an example of how MineFleet offers an ROI by linking vehicle health condition with performance parameters such as fuel economy. The figur e shows the user interface that shows the top five ways to im prove the fuel economy that are identified by various onboard data mining techniques. It also offers fuel savings calculator driv en by predictive models learnt from the data collected from that vehicle. The resulting ROI is direct, simple to understand, and execute. This allows the fleet manager to decide what to do when a particular vehicle health condition arises. Using MineFleet the fleet manager can quantify how much money the organization is likely to save by fixing the health condition. Similar analysis is also performed for driver behavior which will be discussed in the following section. Figure 11 shows the MineFleet fuel subsystem benchmarking module where the distributions of a vehicle can be compared with those of other vehicles. The modul e can also be used to optimize the fuel economy by changing the policy parameters prior to designing a policy. For example, one may vary the speeding policy and find out the optimal fuel economy based on the predictive models learnt from that vehicle. MineFleet allows the fleet owner to monitor both the short-term and long-term behaviors of the drivers in a fleet. MineFleet Onboard monitors the driving rela ted data characterized by speed, acceleration, braking, idling and several other parameters. It also correlates the information with vehicle performance parameters (e.g. fuel economy) and fleet ma intenance parameters. Some of Figure 11. Predictive fuel co nsumption analysis module of the main capabilities of the MineFleet driver behavior monitoring module with short-term return on investment are listed below: Figure 12 shows the MineFleet interface for quantifying the effect of various driving characteristic s on fuel economy. For example, the fuel savings calculator shows the effect of idling on fuel economy and quantifies the saving. The following section discusses the emissions monitoring capabilities of MineFleet. 
Figure 12. Correlation driver behavior with fuel economy. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change are a global problem. Although future concentrations, damages and costs are unknown, it is widely recognized that major emissions reduction efforts are needed. Of the four primary GHG under scrutiny, carbon dioxide (CO2), and the need to lower carbon emissions in general, is of paramount concern. It is estimated that transportation activities are responsible for approximately 25% to 30% of total U.S. GHG emissions, with the on-highway commercial truck market accounting for over 45% of transportation GHG. However, the transportation sector emissions remain almost entirely unaddressed with respect to GHG and CO2 reduction. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provided guidelines for calculating carbon em ission offer estimations only for certain common types of fuels; even the estimates are not available novel fuel blends and gaseous fuels such as CNG and LNG. Indeed, these and other re ferences have documented the uncertainty in model-based theoretical carbon emissions calculations 3 and the need for a standardized, consistent method of accurately characterizing CO 2 emissions. Moreover, correlating various vehicle performance and traffic parameters may open up new insights resulting in bette r techniques for controlling emissions. For example, it is wi dely known that vehicle speed, engine load and state of repair/maintenance play important roles in governing emissions. Mining the emissions data along with the traffic patterns in a metropolitan area, vehicle performance (load, rpm, and vehicle oxygen sensor characteristics) and the driving behavior may provide useful in formation to design speed limits, traffic signals and fleet maintenance policies. Such advanced analysis of emission data will be possible only when we can directly and accurately measure emissions in the vehicle. MineFleet offers some of these possibilities. For example, MineFleet can be used for wireless emissions test. It can measure the emissions data in real-time, correlate that with the vehicle performance and traffic data us ing advanced statistical and machine learning-based techniques such as clustering, predictive modeling, correlation analysis and eigen analysis. These analytics can be used to offer a new gene ration of decision support tools to develop fleet and greenhouse gas em issions management policies. MineFleet computes emissions in real-time onboard the vehicle. It also performs various other tests such as the wireless emissions test required by motor vehicle administrations. Figure 13 shows the emissions monitoring web-page of MineFleet Web Service. Vehicle emission characteristics depend on different vehicle and driver-related parameters. Vehicle h ealth is often a function of the type of the vehicle, maintena nce policies and operating policies (e.g. delivery schedule of supply truck). Driver behavior is also correlated with traffic condition and driver training programs in a commercial fleet. Therefore, the next generation of decision-support tools for emissions management will have to look at the bigger picture correlating emission data with data collected from the different facets of fleet operations. Figure 13. Emissions monitoring web-page in MineFleet.  X  The emissions offset trading market and the demand for cleaner transportation systems is driving several market incentives. Figure 14 shows the web portal of one such carbon offset trading company. The MineFleet technology offers a verifiable methodology to quantify the greenhouse and air-pollution emissions in a vehicle in real-time. As a result, this allows accurate computation of the carbon offsets and reductions in a commercial fleet which lays the foundation of the business of carbon trading. The basic tenets of the value proposition in any business often depend upon the following NABC cornerstones: Note that the NABC (Need, Appr oach, Benefit, and Approach) tenet depends upon the behavior of the customers, their affiliates, the business offering the products /services, and the competition (underscored terms in the itemized list). This essentially means that the value proposition of any product or service depends on the collective behavior of the entire business eco-system comprised of the provider, consumer, competition and others. Moreover, Agnik as an early stage company focused not just on value creation rather sustainable value creation where the business relationships among Agnik and its go-to-market partners for the MineFleet product would be able to sustain the challenges faced by many early stage technology companies. The MineFleet system penetrated the market by evolving rules of engagement that aided sust ainable relationship among the different players of the Mobile Resource Management vertical. Initial MineFleet product placement faced several challenges. Some of those are listed below: Each of these topics is discussed further below. Today, the MineFleet system offers many market-tested features that offer direct short-term RO I and enough case studies exist to back up the claims. However, this was not the case when MineFleet was initially introduced to a select group of potential clients in the early stage. Active collaboration between MineFleet team and other organizations that were willing to explore the technology resulted in the development of many useful features in MineFleet with immediate ROI. The initial experimental versions of the MineFleet system was full of many features that required advanced knowledge of data analysis and modeling techniques. The interface looked like the traditional data mining systems that commercially available. This approach did not work. Advanced visualization and analytic tools often had to be either replaced or backed up by simple text-based actionable intelligence. One the main reason was that the typical fleet management executives are usually not very familiar with the statistics and data mining technology. The user interface had to be non-threatening and relatively easy to understand. Once the vertical became familiar with the role of data mining technology to some extent, advanced analys is and visualization techniques could be introduced. Another major challenge was th e lack of large marketing infrastructure, which is probably common for many early stage companies. MineFleet addressed th is problem by going to market only through its resellers and ch annel partners. Alliance with fairly large companies with large marketing infrastructure helped gaining market share. MineFleet product design choices also highly influenced the evolution of the business eco-system and its sustainability. Figure 15 shows the conceptual depiction of the MineFleet product in 2003. It had a PDA, Bluetoot h GPS module and the vehicle diagnostic port adapter. This con ceptual model evolved a lot over time in order to support a sustaina ble relationship with MineFleet go-to-market channel partners a nd resellers. For example, the PDA-based approach was not adopted because of the high cost issue. On the other hand, the Bluetooth GPS module was dropped mainly to build a relationship w ith many other vendors that offer a GPS tracking solution. 
Figure 15. Early conceptualization of the MineFleet Onboard The above go-to-market approach also helped the support scenario. The need for large support infrastructure was avoided by training the support team of the go-to-market channel partners and resellers. This alleviated the load on the Agnik team to develop an extensive on-the-ground installation and support team for MineFleet. MineFleet is widely adopted by many companies in the Machine-to-Machine and GPS tracking ver ticals. For samples names of such clients please visit the Agnik web-site. MineFleet is already integrated with several large vehicle-onboard hardware manufacturers. MineFleet-powered third-party solutions are currently being deployed through many of Agnik X  X  channel partners each with more than hundr ed thousands of vehicles in their respective rosters. Example of some of those clients are listed at Agnik website. A detailed report 4 analyzing MineFleet X  X  technical and business approaches is available from Frost &amp; Sullivan. A copy of the detailed report is available upon request. MineFleet is available in the software-as-a-service model. The following section concludes this paper. http://finance.yahoo.com/ne ws/Agnik-Enhances-Mobile-prnews-3142016515.html?x=0&amp;.v=1 This paper offered an overview of the MineFleet system and the business case behind it. It desc ribed the architecture, main functionalities, and how these featur es are useful in solving the everyday problems in commercial fleet management. The paper also shared some of the experiences in placing a new distributed data mining technology-based produc t in a vertical that was not very familiar with advanced decision support systems. The paper identified some of the engagement rules that evolved during the course of time resulting in successful partnership between the existing products from the mobile resource management companies and the MineFleet.system. MineFleet is probably the first commercially successful widely adopted distributed data mining sy stem for a new vertical where data mining systems were not used before. The development of MineFleet and its adoption in th e mobile resource management and fleet management indus try came through long-term interactions with the leading co mpanies in that vertical. It required adopting a different architecture for the data mining system. Unlike the traditional centralized data mining system commonly used in the most a pplications today, MineFleet adopted the distributed data mi ning technology where data must be analyzed in a distributed manner and then aggregated at the server for comparative analysis. publication.
