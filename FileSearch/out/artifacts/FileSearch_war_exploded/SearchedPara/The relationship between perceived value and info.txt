 1. Introduction
Research on information source use in decision-making has a long history. Its theoretical underpinnings are rooted in Si-mon X  X  (1955, 1956) bounded rationality theory. According to this theory, the essence of business decision-making for prob-lem solving is correctly identifying the problem, compiling all possible alternative solutions and then selecting the these decisions can be of enormous importance, they can be urgent, requiring the manager to commit substantial human and financial resources but with little time to investigate the problem thoroughly ( Mintzberg, Raisinghani, &amp; Th X oret, 1976 ). Consequently, in real situations, where decisions are made in uncertain environments, human rational behaviour  X  Simon, 1972; Simon &amp; Associates, 1986 ).

Strategic decision-making is a sub-set of decision-making. A business manager who makes strategic decisions is com-monly in charge of at least one business unit for his or her enterprise with supervisory, policy development, and/or strategy development responsibilities, but can be in middle as well as upper management ( Bower, 1970 ). They are strategic planners tegic decision-makers are responsible for sensing the emergence and meanings of various threats and opportunities ( Papadakis, Lioukas, &amp; Chambers, 1998 ). Knowledge management (KM) is an obvious field to improve strategic managerial decision-making during high uncertainty.

KM, in the business world, can be broadly defined as a series of activities undertaken by an organization to identify, ac-quire, retain, share, and re-use its knowledge-based assets with the aim of sustaining core competency and innovation capa-bilities. KM specifically targets procedural or  X  X  X ow to X  X  information decision makers need that is already there in the not written down, this tacit corporate knowledge is inaccessible except through face-to-face contact with people within the corporation. Other explicit knowledge may be badly codified or haphazardly stored by individuals on their computers without concern for subsequent access by others. Corporations acknowledge the importance of data bases of information gathered by its employees during past decision events  X  corporate information, industry information, etc. But KM must also render access to tacit and badly stored explicit knowledge to the manager at the moment of decision-making. One key prob-lem for KM is to develop systems that facilitate the storage, organization, and access to sources of corporate knowledge via the addition of easy to use mechanisms specifically designed so that managers can more effectively make decisions. 2. The general problem
The general problem addressed in this study is to analyze the difficulty managers have in accessing tacit and explicit information to make decisions in high uncertainty situations, within the context of the Chinese corporate environment.
Although KM has been applied and developed in the Western world for over two decades, certain researchers believe that then, KM has been poorly recognized and applied in China. Jian, Li-Hua, and Moffett (2007) conclude that the lack of empir-ical evidence supporting the benefits of KM has become a major barrier to the development of KM research in the Chinese academic community. Jian, Li-Hua, and Moffett (2007, p. 207) note that  X  X  X  majority proportion of Chinese companies either per se [sic] X  X  (for a review, see Lin &amp; Dalkir, 2010 ).

Information science expands on KM research in Chinese business practices and plays a crucial role in today X  X  information age. Finding the right information during all stages of a business manager X  X  decision-making process makes the difference between success and failure. What are the information sources for finding this right information? If we begin to describe what these sources are and how Chinese business managers evaluate these sources, we can establish a starting position for further research into developing retrieval mechanisms so that Chinese managers can efficiently access vital corporate information during high uncertainty decision-making.
 There is a paucity of research on the information sources used by Chinese business managers when they are engaged in
KM strategic decision-making and how and why they attribute value to these sources. We started this study by asking the following questions: What information sources are used by Chinese business managers when they make KM strategic decisions?
What is the perceived value of these information sources by Chinese business managers when making KM strategic decisions? How and why do Chinese business managers attribute value to the information sources they use?
This study, derived from a doctoral dissertation ( Lin, 2011 ), extends existing research on Chinese business managers X  source use and source evaluation behaviour as well as on the influences of source characteristics on source use in strategic decision-making. The study seeks to advance current understanding about Chinese KM strategic decision-making situations by adopting an informational perspective. By defining the relationship between Chinese business managers X  attribution of value to information sources and information source use, the findings of this study can be used to help Chinese business managers make more informed KM strategic decisions, and thus contribute to the promotion of KM practices in China. 3. Literature review
The literature review is divided into the three sections: (a) Western business managers X  use of information sources for strategic decision-making;(b) how Western business managers define the value of information sources; and (c) Chinese re-search literature on how Chinese business managers use and attribute value to information sources.
 3.1. Use of information sources in the west by strategic decision-making managers
In the West, academia has long been interested in business managers X  information source use ( De Alwis, Majid, &amp; Chau-dhry, 2006 ). (Another term for source is channel (e.g., Line, 1971 ), which can be used synonymously with source ( Agarwal, what types of information sources are most favored by business manager? The best recognized classification scheme for information sources was first introduced by Aguilar in 1967, and has been widely adopted and adapted by other scholars (e.g., Agarwal et al., 2011; Choo, 1993; Elenkov, 1997; Xu, Tan, &amp; Yang, 2006; Zimmer, Henry, &amp; Butler, 2008 ).
According to Aguilar, an information source usually has two dimensions: 1. external versus internal, and 2. personal ver-sus impersonal. The origin of the source  X  whether it originates from outside or from inside the organization, determines whether a source is classified as external or internal. The personal/impersonal dimension is determined by whether the information is communicated from one individual directly to the other (personal) or whether the information is obtained from a database or some other non-human information system. As an example, a company X  X  information system as a source of the manager X  X  information is considered an internal impersonal source because it is accessed within the company and it is is regarded as an external personal source.

Past studies indicate that business managers generally prefer personal information sources to impersonal sources ( Choo, 1993; Choo, 2001; Daft, Sormunen, &amp; Parks, 1988; Elenkov, 1997; Keegan, 1974; Mintzberg, 1973; Specht, 1987 ; for excep-dimension. Some studies report that external sources are more frequently used ( El Sawy, 1985; Keegan, 1974; Lackman, Sa-McKnight, 1988; Choo, 1993; Frishammar, 2003; Walters, Jiang, &amp; Klein, 2003 ).

It is notable that due to the advances in information technology, impersonal sources (e.g., company information systems internal information source  X  managers are increasingly going on the Internet or company intranet for this information (an impersonal, external information source and an impersonal internal information source, respectively). The business manager can also easily compare internal practices, obtained from an internal information source, to existing best practices in the industry by going to an external X  X mpersonal information source online. Existing KM literature also emphasizes that it is the heterogeneous knowledge-based assets that determine an organization X  X  core competency and innovation capabilities ( Lin &amp; Dalkir, 2010 ). Therefore, impersonal X  X xternal information sources which serve as a window to what competitors managerial attention in decision-making ( De Alwis et al., 2006; Zimmer et al., 2008 ). 3.2. Definition of value for western business managers when evaluating information sources
In the West, information value as an indicator of information utility has long been a concern. Over 40 years ago, Slamecka (1970, p.567) argued that  X  X  X he development of a pragmatic measure of information utility must rank as the most important mation should be user-based and context-based  X  i.e., an information message is  X  X  X iven value by a  X  X ser X  who sees its po-tential  X  X sefulness X  because he or she is in a particular environment and can relate the message to the problems and tasks of that environment X  X  ( Taylor, 1986, p.15 ). In other words, information should be about something (i.e., context-dependent) and for someone (i.e., agency-dependent) ( Van Benthem &amp; Martinez, 2008 ).

When assessing the value of an information source, there is often confusion between a source and the information from that source. To the average person, the characteristics of an information source largely depend on the characteristics of the information from the source. For the average person, an example of the characteristics of the information itself (not the source) being a determining factor of information source value is relevance (e.g., Choo, 1993 ).

However, there are determining characteristics related almost uniquely to the source itself. An example would be the facility of source use by the manager which is partially determined by the manager X  X  information context-situation. Another example of the independent characteristics of the information source is source accessibility, often defined as the extent to which one can easily approach, contact, or locate the source. For example, Choo (1993) found that Canadian telecommuni-cations executives preferred using internal X  X ersonal sources of information instead of external sources if the internal X  X er-sonal source was easily accessible and of high quality in terms of relevancy and reliability. The internal X  X ersonal source, a on the colleague X  X  characteristics as a person. Relevancy could also be considered a dimension or characteristic of the col-league as an information source rather than the information from that source because the colleague had the ability to shape the information message in terms of the decision-maker X  X  particular context.

Like Choo, a number of recent studies first characterize an information source in terms of accessibility and quality, and characteristics, however, are not mutually exclusive. For instance, Xu and Chen (2006) found that topicality, reliability, understandability and novelty were significantly associated with relevancy.
There is still no consensus as to which of the two, information source accessibility or quality, plays a more important role ingly, two recent studies by Agarwal et al. (2011) and Zimmer et al. (2008) find that source quality and accessibility are equally significant.

Unfortunately, most studies on the influences of source characteristics on source use are neither specifically concerned with business managers nor framed within the context of strategic decision-making (e.g., Agarwal et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2006; Zimmer et al., 2008 ). Instead, the existing literature on criteria for information source selection in strategic deci-sion-making (e.g., Dean &amp; Sharfman, 1993; Frishammar, 2003; Williams, 2001 ) has primarily concentrated on the informa-tion-processing perspective: i.e., how business managers seek and use information sources to reduce uncertainties and find better alternatives for decision problems.

This is not the information-utility perspective we highlight in this article: i.e., how the characteristics of information sources affect business managers X  source use in strategic decision situations. 3.3. The Chinese literature on the use and value for Chinese business managers when evaluating information sources
We assume that when Chinese business managers make KM strategic decisions they use and  X  X  X alue X  X  information sources differently than Western business managers. This assumption is based on existing cross-cultural studies that show that, in the process of decision-making, individuals with different socio-cultural backgrounds perceive, organize, and use informa-stantially influence business managers X  use of information and information sources in decision-making ( Bouthillier, 2003 ).
Unfortunately, few studies combine the cultural aspects of managers and the effect of these cultural aspects on these man-agers X  decision-making.

Most Chinese business managers and employees were brought up in an environment in which people place a greater va-lue on collectivism than individualism, and therefore focus more on means  X  i.e., on long-term relationships and implicit exchanges with colleagues  X  than on ends and the intended outcomes ( Berrell, Wrathall, &amp; Wright, 2001; Hall, 1976; Mead, 1994 ). Compared with Western business managers, Chinese business managers think more holistically, emphasize interde-pendent relationships among different variables, accept multiple realities, assign more value to experience, and prefer ana-lytical reasoning-based decisions ( Haley &amp; Haley, 2006 ). Strategic decisions are made via  X  X  X nformal and uncodified management knowledge, including KM theory, from the West to China cannot be a linear endeavor, because a linear transfer would be based on false or western assumptions about the nature of knowledge and knowledge transmission in China. The
Chinese model involves much more tacit corporate knowledge and experience transferred between social contexts that are significantly different from Western business models ( Hofstede, 1994; Newell, 1999; Warner, 1993 ).
We end the literature review with the only three studies that have specifically looked at Chinese business managers X  per-ceived value of different types of information sources or the methods these managers used to determine the value of infor-mation sources.

The first study is an experimental study undertaken by Packard (2006) which compared the influences of culture and cog-nitive style on the use of information (not information sources) between Chinese and American managers in decision-mak-ing situations. Her findings show that national culture significantly affects the use of holistic information but not that of ing the process of decision-making.

The second study is a survey study by Chow, Deng, and Yuen (2006) which explored Chinese business mangers X  informa-tion needs in decision-making, their assessment of the adequacy of the information available to them, their desired improve-ments to the information, and their expected barriers for accomplishing such improvements. The majority of the participants in their study were top-and middle-level business managers with considerable decision-making experience at either a stra-tegic or an operational level. These managers were asked to identify the two most important pieces of information they usu-ally used to support their decision-making, and rate the information on ten predetermined information attributes, including information needs, Chinese business managers favor external information for marketing, government policies and legislation mely high), the participants X  ratings of the information attributes range from 4.72 (for ease of access) to 5.49 (for availability).
 The third study is a combination survey plus in-depth interviews of attendees at conference meetings in Hong Kong and
Shanghai by Martinsons and Davison (2007) which compared information system support for Japanese, American and Chi-nese managers in their strategic decision-making. They defined and then compared the three national groups based on whether decision-making was conceptual decision style, an analytic decision style and a directive decision style. The researchers found that the Chinese business leaders scored the highest of the three groups on directive decision style and lowest on conceptual decision style. Martinsons and Davison conclude that:
The directive tendencies of Chinese business leaders can be attributed to their high power distance and high degree of in-group collectivism. In contrast to America X  X  preoccupation with individual freedom, the Chinese typically seek to main-tain social order through a harmony-within-hierarchy arrangement. Consequently, centralized and arbitrary (or discre-tionary) decisions are common in both mainland and overseas Chinese businesses ( Martinsons &amp; Davison, 2007, p. 294 ).
Martinsons and Davison (2007) conclude that because of the importance of social hierarchy and top-down control, Chi-nese strategic decision makers prefer informal and uncodified information channels for their information. The tone of feed-back from subordinates of the decision maker is of utmost importance, according to this study, which means the decision maker favors personal information sources, someone they could  X  X  X rust, X  X  over  X  X  X nonymous X  X  impersonal information sources ( Martinsons &amp; Davison, 2007, p. 296 ).

A limitation of the first two studies for our purposes is that both the Packard (2006) and Chow et al. (2006) focused on information instead of information sources. Packard specifically examined what type(s) of information Chinese business managers used, while Chow et al. tried to further understand Chinese business managers X  perceived importance of informa-tion attributes to help explain why these managers valued information. An information focus necessarily has a stronger psy-chological dimension while an information source focus has a stronger sociological dimension. This second sociological dimension is the prime objective of our study. 4. Conceptual framework
In Fig. 1 , we outline the conceptual framework for the study, based on De Alwis et al. X  X  (2006) literature review and sum-mary typology of Western managers X  use and value attribution of information sources during strategic decision-making. In model, into four categories: Personal/social X  X ultural factors; Situational factors; Contextual factors; and Informational factors.

In Fig. 1 , Personal/social X  X ultural factors are comprised of a business manager X  X  personal characteristics and social X  cultural background. Situational factors refer to  X  X  X ariables associated with the company, industry and the competition X  X  to the source quality, accessibility, and other characteristics of information and information sources utilized by business mangers during decision-making.

De Alwis et al. (2006) emphasize that the four categories of factors affecting business managers X  source preferences  X  X  X eed compares and contrasts Chinese managers X  strategic decision-making in two industrial sectors of the Chinese economy: tele-communications and manufacturing. These two sectors were selected because, prima facie, manufacturing and telecommu-nications provide two very different socio-cultural and situational contexts to study information factors affecting Chinese old-school, and process-oriented sector where efficiency is the dominating characteristic. Telecommunications, on the other tors affecting business managers X  information source preference: contextual factors. This limitation is addressed in the Dis-cussion section of this article. 5. Research questions
The purpose of this study is to revise De Alwis et al. X  X  (2006) typology model in light of study findings of Chinese business managers X  information source use and how they evaluate or value these information sources in KM strategic decision-mak-ing, from an information-utility perspective. The three research questions for the study are: 1. What types of information sources do Chinese business managers use when making KM strategic decisions? a. Is there a difference between manufacturing and telecommunications industry business managers in what informa-2. What are the attributes of  X  X  X alue X  X  when these Chinese business managers evaluate the different types of information sources when making KM strategic decisions? a. Is there a difference between manufacturing and telecommunications industry business managers in their attributes 3. How do Chinese business managers value different types of information sources when making KM strategic decisions and why? a. Is there a difference between manufacturing and telecommunications industry business managers in how and why 6. The study: methodology
The purpose of the study is to provide a holistic examination of the constructive processes that underlie Chinese business managers X  information source use and evaluation in a real-life strategic decision situation. Semi-structured interviews were values, and open-ended questions to get at the how and why of value attribution and information source use. A small pilot study was also conducted to validate the research design, and a few changes regarding the research questions and interview protocol were made based on the pilot study results and feedbacks. 7. Interview protocol
The interview protocol lists the sixteen information sources from Choo (1993) which had been previously used by Aguilar (1967), Keegan (1974), Culnan (1983) , and Daft et al. (1988) . We updated Choo X  X  list to include recent system-based infor-mation sources. The participants were then asked to rate frequency of use for each information source. Following Aguilar (1967) and Choo (1993) , the information sources were categorized as external and internal sources, and then sub-catego-tocol, the interview subjects were asked to list  X  X  X ther X  X  information sources.

The study participants were then asked to characterize an information source in terms of relevancy, comprehensiveness, tion of source characteristics was adopted. These are: 1. Source relevancy: the extent to which the information from a source is needed and useful with respect to the goals and activities. 2. Source comprehensiveness: the extent to which the capacity of an information source is thorough and comprehensive. 3. Source reliability: the extent to which the information from a source is authoritative and dependable. 4. Source time and effort: the time and effort devoted to approach, contact, or locate the source. 5. Source accessibility: the extent to which the information source is difficult or easy to access.

The structured questions asked of participants and the points on the Likert Scales for each of the five value attributes (translated from the Chinese) are presented below: 1. How relevant do you perceive the information provided by each of the following sources is when you make KM strategic decisions? Please use  X  X  p  X  X  to indicate your answer in the box.

Information source Irrelevant Fairly irrelevant Of some relevance Fairly relevant Relevant 2. How thorough or comprehensive do you think the capacity of each of the following sources is when you make KM stra-tegic decisions? Please use  X  X  p  X  X  to indicate your answer in the box.

Information source Restricted Fairly restricted Somewhat 3. How reliable do you think the information of each of the following sources is when you make KM strategic decisions? Please use  X  X  p  X  X  to indicate your answer in the box.

Information source Unreliable Fairly unreliable Somewhat reliable Fairly reliable Reliable 4. How much time and effort do you need [i.e., devote] to approach or acquire each of the following information sources when you make KM strategic decisions? Please use  X  X  p  X  X  to indicate your answer in the box.

Information source Very little Little Some A lot Great deal 5. How difficult is it for you to access your desired information from each of the following information sources when you make KM strategic decisions? Please use  X  X  p  X  X  to indicate your answer in the box.
 Information source Very hard Hard Normal Easy Very easy
In addition, several open-ended questions, listed below, were used to uncover the ways and criteria that participants used to value information sources in KM strategic decision-making. 1. Please explain how you decide: 2. In general, how do you value different types of information sources when making KM strategic decisions? Why? 3. When you make other strategic decisions, such as entering new business ventures, restructuring your organizations, or handling important, unexpected events, do you value information source with the same or similar criteria? Why or why not? 8. Data collection
A convenience sampling strategy was used to collect the data. At the beginning, four KM consulting companies and two universities were contacted. One of the consulting companies, the Knowledge Management Center (KMC), facilitated the recruitment of subjects. Later, the primary investigator was given the opportunity to attend two workshops organized by
KMC to solicit participants. A further recruiting method was to network with the business managers in charge of their orga-nizations X  KM strategic decisions through a widely known online forum sponsored by KMC. After their online profiles were reviewed, more than 100 invitation letters were sent out by e-mail. Further participants were recruited through personal and referral contacts  X  a snowball sampling strategy.

In total, eighteen Chinese business managers engaged in KM strategic decision-making for their companies were inter-viewed. Half of them worked in the Chinese manufacturing industry, and the other half worked in the Chinese telecommu-nications industry. Both the manufacturing and telecommunications industries are knowledge-intensive and highly competitive (especially after China X  X  admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001), and considered by policy makers to be fundamental to the Chinese economy. A number of studies find that industry type could greatly affect KM practices in source use and evaluation behaviour between Chinese manufacturing and telecommunications managers helps better iden-tify and explain the potential relationship between source attributes and source use, thus increasing the power of analysis.
It was essential that all participants be high enough up in their corporate hierarchy to engage in KM strategic decision-making. A manufacturing manager was later removed from this study because it was found that she had never participated in any KM decision-making. The remaining 17 participants were considered to have met the required qualifications for the study.

The primary investigator travelled to Beijing, Nanjing, Dalian, and Shenyang to interview participants in person. The parameters of the interview and a copy of the interview protocol were sent to each participant prior to the interview by
The interviews lasted 30 X 60 min and were recorded. Five participants asked to complete the questions after the interviews and return the results by e-mail. Four of these did not answer several questions, which resulted in some incomplete data. The porate documentation were resolved through e-mails or phone calls. 9. Data analysis
The participants were divided into two industrial sector groups: the manufacturing group and the telecommunications group. Answers for each group of participants were analyzed and then compared to identify similarities and differences dur-ing KM strategic decision-making. In order to prevent potential distortion of contextual information and translation biases, all interview data were manually transcribed and analyzed in Chinese first. The analyzed data were then translated into English.

Data collected from the structured queries were analyzed and presented in a percentage form. The participants who had incomplete data for a specific query were excluded when the final percentages for that query were calculated. However, in many cases, a participant X  X  perspective on certain unasked questions could be indirectly captured from his or her answers to other questions.

The qualitative data (i.e., data collected from open-ended questions for Research Question 3) were analyzed by identifying and Corbin and Strauss (2008) , sixteen thematic-analysis steps were designed to surface salient themes in the data. In the end, a code book was compiled with a clear definition, a description, and several examples assigned to each code. Construct-ing the code book was an inductive process involving constant revisions.

Analysis of the qualitative data was performed manually because the total number of interviews was relatively small, which made exploratory manual analysis of the data feasible (analysis software mechanizes category development to a lim-process the analyzed results were translated into English. 10. Findings
The findings for each of the three research questions are presented in order after the data summary tables. Table 1 pre-sents the findings for Research Question 1 and Research Question 2. Table 2 presents the findings for Research Question 3.
The findings were derived from an analysis of the data acquired from the structured queries (summarized in Table 1 ) and the open ended questions coding themes (summarized in Table 2 ).

For purposes of effectively summarizing the data, Table 1 shows a percentage number for value attributes only where
Scale, we grouped them together and gave the total for the two points a positive percentage ( P 50%). When the study par-ticipants selected either point one or two on the scale, we again grouped them together but gave the total a negative per-centage ( P 50%). When reading the table, positive percentage numbers represent positive participant evaluations for value attributes. 10.1. Research Question 1: Use of information sources 1. What types of information sources do Chinese business managers use when making KM strategic decisions? a. Is there a difference between manufacturing and telecommunications industry business managers in what informa-
The Chinese managers X  use of 16 information sources is shown in Table 1 . The study participants indicated their use of each information source on a 5-point Likert Scale. For  X  X  X se, X  X  Table 1 only shows information sources where 50% or more in the Likert Scale, indicated by a negative number.
 For all participants combined, the most used information sources were internal information sources  X  Superiors/Board Members and Subordinate managers  X  while the least used were external information sources  X  Government officials;
Newspapers; Broadcast media; and Industrial associations. The difference for information source use between telecommu-nications and manufacturing managers was striking. Compared to telecommunications managers, manufacturing managers used external sources more with a much wider variety of external sources.

Telecommunications : The two information sources, Subordinate managers and Internal studies/reports, were the inter-nal information sources most frequently used by telecommunications participants (with 88.9% indicating either the 4[th] or 5[th] highest point on the Likert Scale).

Manufacturing : The most frequently used information sources for manufacturing participants was Superiors/board members and Customers (87.5%). 10.2. Research Question 2: Perceived value of information sources 1. What is the Chinese business managers X  perceived value of different types of information sources when making KM stra-tegic decisions? a. Is there a difference between manufacturing and telecommunications industry business managers in their attributes Table 1 lists the data collected from the participants concerning the five value attributes for the information sources: 1.
Relevancy;2. Comprehensiveness;3. Reliability;4. Time/Effort; and 5. Accessibility. Table 1 gives total value for each value a  X  X 0 X  X  to value attributes that received no percentage number.

The total value is calculated per value attribute for all information sources combined (the bottom row of Table 1 ). We will discuss these values further in the Practical Implications section. In summary, the totals indicate that Comprehensiveness is an issue for the Chinese managers when they select an information source during strategic decision-making (0% of the tele-communications managers and 7.8% of the manufacturing managers said this value was difficult to obtain in the information sources), while Accessibility was indicated as not being an issue or problematic by both the telecommunications and man-ufacturing managers (but especially manufacturing mangers 68.8% of whom marked the Accessibility value as  X  X  X asy X  X ).
The total value attribution is calculated per information source for telecommunications and manufacturing participants separately. The two information sources accorded the highest value attribution (underlined in Table 1 ) were:
Internal studies/reports (average 81.1% and 76.1% positive rating from telecommunications and manufacturing partici-pants respectively): This information source was judged as:  X  relevant: 88.9% rating by the telecommunications and 57.1% rating by the manufacturing participants,  X  comprehensive: 77.8% rating by telecommunications and 62.5% rating by manufacturing participants,  X  reliable: 88.9% rating by telecommunications and 85.7% rating by the manufacturing participants,  X  time/effort devoted to using them: 50% rating by telecommunications and 75% rating by manufacturing participants,  X  accessible: 100% rating by telecommunications and 100% rating by manufacturing participants.

Subordinate managers (average 68.9% and 84.3% positive rating from telecommunications and manufacturing partici-pants respectively): This information source was judged as:  X  relevant: 77.8% rating by the telecommunications and 100% rating by the manufacturing participants,  X  comprehensive: 55.6% rating by the telecommunications and 75.0% rating by the manufacturing participants,  X  reliable: 66.7% by the telecommunications and 71.4% rating by the manufacturing participants,  X  time/effort devoted to using it: 55.6% rating by telecommunications and 75% rating by manufacturing participants),  X  accessible: 88.9% rating by the telecommunications and 100% rating by the manufacturing participants.
The standout information source valued negatively by both telecommunications and manufacturing participants was (also underlined in Table 1 ):
Government officials (average 51.1% and 25% negative rating from telecommunications and manufacturing partici-pants respectively). This information source was judged as  X  relevant: 55.6% rating by telecommunications with no tendency rating by manufacturing participants,  X  comprehensive: 88.9% rating by telecommunications and 62.5% rating by manufacturing participants,  X  time and effort devoted to it: 55.6% rating by telecommunications and 62.5% rating by manufacturing participants,  X  accessibility: 55.6% rating by telecommunications and no rating tendency by manufacturing participants. The difference between telecommunications and manufacturing participants was striking for four information sources:
Telecommunications participants valued the Corporate library/intranet &amp; databases much more highly than manufacturing participants (57.8% versus 10%), while manufacturing participants valued much more highly: Customers (77.5% versus 33.4%), Newspapers/magazines (37.5% versus 4.4%) and Conferences/trips (72.8% versus 26.7%).

From Table 1 , for the information source Competitors, while both telecommunications and manufacturing participants deemed this source relevant and negatively accessible ( 100%), for the value attribute 4. Time/effort, telecommunications participants devoted a lot of time/effort to this information source (88.9%) while manufacturing participants did not. 10.3. Research Question 3: How and why Chinese business managers value information sources 3. How and why do Chinese business managers value different types of information sources when making KM strategic decisions?
To get at how and why Chinese business managers value different information sources when making KM strategic deci-sions, we collected qualitative data via the opened ended questions the participants answered during the interviews. Table 2 summarizes the four themes identified from coding the qualitative data.

From Table 2 , Theme 1 Source Comprehensiveness (SC): Eleven of 17 participants answered that only a systematic, syn-thesized review of the information collected from multiple information sources could be considered a complete information search. The following is an illustrative quote from one of the interviews: after synthesizing the information from all information sources, will we have an objective, real, complete point of view (Sales manager of a telecommunications enterprise).

Theme 2 Source Reliability (SR): Six telecommunications participants perceived that by consulting multiple sources they were better able to verify the reliability of a particular piece of information. To illustrate this theme, we quote one participant:

 11. Summary of key findings
There were several important findings which have implications for the development of ancillary information services and systems to facilitate access to key corporate knowledge for Chinese business managers during their strategic decision-mak-ing processes. 11.1. Research Question 1: Use of information sources For all participants combined, the most used information sources were internal information sources  X  Superiors/Board Members and Subordinate managers  X  while the least used were external information sources  X  Government officials; Newspapers; Broadcast media; and Industrial associations.

The difference for information source use between telecommunications and manufacturing managers was striking. Man-ufacturing managers used external sources more and a much wider variety of external sources.

Telecommunications managers used Subordinate managers and Internal studies/reports most (with 88.9% indicating either the 4[th] or 5[th] highest point on the Likert Scale).

Manufacturing managers used the information sources Superiors/board members and Customers (with 87.5% indicating either the 4[th] or 5[th] highest point on the Likert Scale). 11.2. Research Question 2: Perceived value of information sources
The two information sources accorded the highest value attribution by both telecommunications and manufacturing managers were: Internal studies/reports (average 78.6% positive rating): Subordinate managers (average 76.6% positive rating): The standout information source valued negatively by both telecommunications and manufacturing participants was: Government officials (average 38.1% negative rating).
 The difference between telecommunications and manufacturing participants was striking for four information sources:
Telecommunications participants valued the Corporate library/intranet &amp; databases much more highly than manufactur-ing participants (57.8% versus 10%).

Manufacturing participants valued Customers (77.5% versus 33.4%), Newspapers/magazines (37.5% versus 4.4%) and Con-ferences/trips (72.8% versus 26.7%) much more highly than telecommunications participants.

Both Telecommunications and Manufacturing participants indicated the information source Competitors relevant and negatively accessible ( 100%). However, Telecommunications participants devoted a lot of Time/effort to this informa-tion source (88.9%) while manufacturing participants did not. 11.3. Research Question 3: How and why Chinese business managers value information sources
Theme 1 Source Comprehensiveness (SC): Eleven of 17 participants answered that only a systematic, synthesized review of the information collected from multiple information sources could be considered a complete information search.
Theme 2 Source Reliability (SR): Six telecommunications participants perceived that by consulting multiple sources they were better able to verify the reliability of a particular piece of information.

Theme 3 Priority Sequence of Source Characteristics (PSSC): In establishing the highest priority value attribute, a specific theme emerged for 14 of the 17 participants: Source Reliability was the most important attribute.

Theme 4 Decision Context (DC): The seven participants who answered the question preferred to use the same or similar tactics to value information sources in other strategic decision situations.
 The only important difference between telecommunications and manufacturing participants was regarding Theme 2:
Source Reliability (SR), which was much more important for telecommunications participants than for manufacturing participants (66.7% versus 37.5%). 12. Discussion 12.1. Research Question 1: Use of information sources
The findings of this study indicate that in KM strategic decision-making, participants preferred to use internal information egory of external impersonal sources (with the exception of electronic information services). The popular belief is that man-agers prefer personal sources of information, which this study corroborates, but the study also nuances this preference with the finding that Chinese business managers prefer internal personal information sources.

Given the relative  X  X  X ewness X  X  of KM in China, one reason for this may be that there simply are not that many external KM information sources, let alone ones with a proven track record of credibility. From a KM perspective, most maturity models ganized rather than guided by policy and procedures.

Another reason for this preference for internal personal information sources is that KM is often considered a defensive strategy to the threat from within (i.e., a strategy that is conservative and responds primarily to the contingencies within an organization X  X  domain of operations). In this sense, participants may prefer to use internal and personal information sources to better understand the current state of their internal organizational environments in order to best protect their positions in the organization. One participant said,  X  X  X egarding the organizational KM, my information sources can tell me organization X  X  internal activities and has nothing to do with the external environment. X  X  Past research finds that knowledge 2005; Weir &amp; Hutchings, 2005 ). When Chinese business managers have little time to search information, they may turn to the internal sources that they trust or have good guanxi with for help.

Our study findings show differences in source use between manufacturing and telecommunications participants. Manu-facturing participants more frequently used the external information sources of Customers, Business/professional associates, and Conferences/trips, and also considered these three external sources more valuable than telecommunications partici-pants. There may be several reasons for this difference.

First, some manufacturing participants indicated that because KM should eventually help their companies serve custom-ers, planning a KM program required them to constantly communicate with customers to understand their needs and concerns.

Second, a large-sized manufacturing company usually has a group of customers with highly defined requirements. The telecommunications industry creates consumer need with technological innovation. Thus, it may be more of a necessity for Chinese manufacturing managers to establish and manage relationships with their customers and obtain needed information from them than for Chinese telecommunications managers.

Thirdly, the manufacturing managers used Conferences/trips as an information source more than telecommunications managers. In the Chinese manufacturing industry, conferences usually refer to those hosted by industrial associations.
Since these industrial associations always represent the voice of the government, attending conferences was seen by manufacturing managers as a formal channel to know about the latest government policies. 12.2. Research Question 2: Perceived value of information sources
The fundamental notion underlying this research question is that the Chinese manager participants in the study will award high value ratings to information sources they frequently use. If so, we assume an overall 1:1 relationship between value attribution and information source use. For most of the 16 information sources covered in the study, this was more or less true. However, for both telecommunications and manufacturing participants, study findings indicate negative correla-tions between use and value for two information sources: Competitors Electronic Information Services
For these two information sources, study participants felt they had to refer or use them during strategic decision-making, but they were of low value for the five value attributes covered in the study: Relevancy, Comprehensiveness, Reliability, Time/effort, and Accessibility.

In addition, for manufacturing participants only, there was also high use and negative value attribution for the informa-tion sources: Government Publications Corporate Library
Whether the participants are in the telecommunications or manufacturing sector seems to be an important variable in the study participants X  KM strategic decision-making, which supports the notion that industry type could greatly affect Chinese manufacturing participants), study findings indicate four major differences between the manufacturing and telecommuni-cations participants in value attribution for the following information sources: 1. Customers (77.5% average value rating for manufacturing participants versus 33.4% for telecommunications). 2. Newspapers/magazines (37.5% average value rating for manufacturing participants versus 4.4% for telecommunications). 3. Conferences/trips (72.8% average value rating for manufacturing participants versus 26.7% for telecommunications). 4. Corporate library/intranet &amp; databases (10% average value rating for manufacturing participants versus 57.8% for telecommunications).

These observed differences between the Chinese manufacturing and telecommunications mangers in the study are con-na and the West, the manufacturing sector compared to the telecommunications industrial sector is: 1. more customer-oriented and led, 2. more dependent on information about economic ups and downs available to managers in the business pages of newspapers, 3. more dependent on government policy announced at conferences, and 4. less dependent on information concerning product-technology innovation obtained via the corporate library/intranet and information databases. 12.3. Research Question 3: How and why Chinese business managers value information sources
Why did the Chinese managers in the study value one information source over another when they made strategic deci-his or her personal experience and character, denying the role of context and emphasizing instead relationships and past experiences. According to Agarwal et al.,  X  X  X his could be because of a strong habit established in past experience with each Butler, Cray, Mallory, &amp; Wilson, 1986; Mackenzie, 2005; Pfeffer, 1981; Schwenk, 1984 ).

Practical implications of study findings
The study contributes to the process of establishing which information sources Chinese business managers use during their strategic decision-making, and how and why these Chinese business managers select to use one information source over another. In this section, we attempt to broaden the findings into a more general description of information source use, to a certain extent operationalizing the findings so that they can be tested and compared to patterns of information source use of other decision makers in other parts of the world.

It is our contention that the study findings contradicts the generally held belief about strategic decision-making, which is based on the assumption that managers conduct an internal cost-benefit analysis to determine which information source to go to during high uncertainty. We find that it is not the case. This leads us to propose a different view departing from both the least-effort and cost-benefit perspective: that Chinese business managers X  information source use during strategic decision-making is determined by a synthesized perception of source characteristics and information seeking strategies on the part of the Chinese managers in the study.

We illustrate this important practical implication of the study findings by inserting the aggregate value attribute totals concerning the five value attributes in quasi-cost-benefit framework. Which attribute would be considered a cost and which a benefit? For a Chinese business manager who is considering seeking information from one information source over an-other, an a priori prediction is: Cost: Time/effort and Accessibility Benefit: Relevance, Reliability and Comprehensiveness attribute, whereas the three  X  X  X enefit X  X  value attributes are, in aggregate, the Relevance, Reliability and Comprehensive attributes.

In Table 3 , we integrate the actual aggregate value attribute scores taken from the bottom row of Table 1 . Participants

In Table 3 , we note that the form of cost-benefit analysis given here contradicts Table 2  X  X  finding of Theme 3 where the sources to cross check the information reliability amongst multiple sources.

The value attribute aggregate totals are similar for the Telecommunications and Manufacturing manager participants, ex-cept for the Accessibility attribute value which is awarded a much higher value by the Manufacturing participants. It can be argued from this cost-benefit implication of the study findings that the Relevancy and Accessibility value attributes, rather than Reliability, are the primary value attributes determining information source use during KM strategic decision-making creation of personalized information system facilitating devices devoted specifically to this clientele. 14. Theoretical implications of the study findings
We created a new model for Chinese business managers X  information source use in KM strategic decision-making, which revises De Alwis et al. X  X  (2006) typology shown in Fig. 1 of the conceptual framework section. We both removed from and added to their typology in our revised model shown in Fig. 2 .

The De Alwis et al. (2006) typology of factors was not framed in strategic decision-making, therefore their categories of strategic decision-making literature.  X  X  X ork-related X  X  is quite difficult to explain or define, and not necessarily concerned with the business manager making a strategic decision. Instead, decision-specific factors discussed in the existing strategic decision-making literature and concerned with the specific organizational situation and characteristics of a given decision sion), are more appropriate category factors affecting information source use in KM strategic decision-making. We therefore
Furthermore, the model must also take into account the dramatic differences in information source use and value attri-bution between the telecommunications and manufacturing participants in the study because this indicates that industry sector is an important factor. Manufacturing managers used external sources more and a much wider variety of external sources than telecommunications managers. Manufacturing managers used Customers as an information source more than telecommunications managers. And while manufacturing managers used the information source Superiors/board members, telecommunications managers used Subordinate managers.

There is also evidence from Chow et al. (2006), Martinsons and Davison (2007) , and Packard (2006) that cultural differ-ences are also important  X  in other words, there are observed differences in information source use and value attribution between the Chinese managers in our study and the findings from studies of the information source use of Western strategic decision-makers. Lin and Dalkir (2010) summarized the factors affecting Chinese KM implementation and organized these edge hoarding, guanxi (i.e., relationship networks) and face saving, can be used to explain Chinese business managers X  source use and evaluation behaviour.

What would be good generic terms to take these study findings X  factors into account in the revised model? Situational factors, according to De Alwis et al. (2006) , consist of two subgroups: organizational and environmental. We incorporated these two subgroups in our revised model as sufficiently generic terms. Furthermore, the strategic decision-making litera-ture utilizes the terms environmental and organizational factors. Environmental factors (e.g., environmental uncertainty, analyzability, complexity, and dynamism) and organizational factors (e.g., organizational strategy, size, age, and informa-tion-processing structure) have been shown to be significantly related to business managers X  information source use when the managers are trying to understand and interpret strategic issues, and to make fast and effective decisions in an incom-Thomas et al., 1990 ).

In summary, the two most important modifications to De Alwis et al. X  X  (2006) original typology are: as both groups are independent, and have been found to significantly influence information source use by Chinese busi-ness managers in KM strategic decision-making. making literature.

X  X  It encourages a holistic view of business managers X  source-use behaviour, and emphasizes that, to understand what affects business managers X  source preferences in strategic decision-making situations, an in-depth and multi-faceted analysis of the influences of different groups of factors should be carried out. 15. Conclusion and further research
The study investigated Chinese business managers X  information source use and linked five value attributes to source use in KM strategic decision-making. The findings show that the Chinese business managers prefer to use internal sources rather than external sources, and prefer personal as opposed to impersonal sources. This confirms previous research on Chinese business decision-making such as Martinsons and Davison X  X  (2007) which showed that Chinese decision makers preferred informal and uncodified  X  i.e., personal  X  information channels.

There were two new findings in the study. First, the study participants indicated that only a systematic, synthesized re-view of the information collected from multiple information sources can be considered comprehensive and reliable, and they also indicated that source reliability is the most fundamental source characteristic affecting source use. However, a closer examination of the data in Tables 2 and 3 allowed us to nuance this finding. Table 2  X  X  strategy analysis based on the qual-was obtained by the study participants via information seeking strategies. Relevancy and accessibility were the two value attributes shown in Table 3 to be the  X  X  X enefit X  X  value attributes while comprehensiveness and time/effort were the most determining information source use, and the supporting strategies that affect this determination.

The second important study finding is that the Chinese business managers X  source use in KM strategic decision-making cannot be determined by source characteristics alone. Instead, it depends on multiple groups of organizational, environmen-tal and decision-making factors. Organizational and environmental context are therefore important when selecting value attributes of one information source over another during KM strategic decision-making. In this regard, the difference be-tween the telecommunications and manufacturing participants in the study was dramatic. Compared to the manufacturing participants in the study, the telecommunications business managers in the study attributed much less value to the infor-mation sources: Customers, Newspaper/magazines, and Conferences/business trips, while attributing much more value to tinctive features of the telecommunications versus manufacturing sectors of the economy  X  i.e., telecommunications is more technology-innovation driven versus manufacturing which is more market driven.

The model we have devised based on our study findings attempts to incorporate these multiple groups of factors, thus ronmental context of KM strategic decision-making.

Further research is required to examine the proposed model and the potential inter-relationships among source use,
Chinese versus Western business managers X  information source use in strategic decision-making. What is needed is a large-scale study using a statistical analysis package such as SPSS that would compare information source use and value attribution during KM strategic decision-making for Chinese versus Western manager participants.
