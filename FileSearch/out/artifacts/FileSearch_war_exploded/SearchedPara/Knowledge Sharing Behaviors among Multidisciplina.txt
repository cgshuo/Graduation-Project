 Thailand is entering a stage of digital economy. This means Thailand is adopting the application of Information and Communication T echnology (ICT) for its competi tive business advantage. The Thai government is moving toward a new era for its country X  X  production, communications, and consumption. This is referred to as the Thailand 4.0 initiative or the Thailand 4.0 Economic Master Plan [ 1 ] . Therefore, a skilled workforce and strategic investments in Research and Development (R&amp;D) will be significant fac-tors to reach this eco nomic transfo rmation. Thailand was once leading its neighbors on the competitiveness indicators. However, other countries have been catching up; while some of these economies in the region have already sur passed in the areas of techno-logical readiness, hig her education and training, innovation, market development, in-stitutions, and business superiority [ 2 ] . 
For Thailand X  X  initiatives to meet their full pote ntial, it would require more in vest-ments i n R&amp;D and developments in its graduates with problem -solving and analytical implementation of its large infrastructure mega projects to make Thailand the hub of the Assoc iation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

Thailand also has the potential to invest in its schools and universities. Thus, Thai -land is needed to expand the availability of these ski lls. Thailand X  X  technological ab-sorption capacity is crucially depended o n the avai lability of highly skilled work forces [ 2 ] . In turn, it would be vital for the Thai students to be able to keep pace with changes in order to remain competitive. The Thai students need to b e equipped with the neces-sary skills and abilities to respond to the changes [ 3 ] . Accordingly, the results of the 2015 Program for International S tudent Assessment (PISA) identified that strengthen-ing skills is a main priority for allowing Thailand to realize its vision under the Thailand 4.0 initiative. 
The PISA report was highlighted that half of Thai students achieved below the basic proficiency level in science, mathematics and reading. This in turn indicates that Thai needed for modern employments. Equipping the Thai workforce with the necessary skills for em ployments presently and in the future is significant for Thai land X  X  econ-omy. Subsequently, these students are the future workforces of Thailand, it will be crit-ical that these students possess the skills and technical expertise required for the Thai-land 4. 0 initiative in which innovations will be the main driving force to push Thailand into a digital economy.
 Accordingly, knowledge is the most important component in innovation [ 3 ] . Hence, Knowledge Sharing (KS) is the significant process of Knowledge Management (KM). element of the overall Thailand X  X  digital societ y. In other words, the digital economy is depended on innovation, linking to new creation and sharing of knowledge which are processes of KM.

Whereas, KS plays an exceptionally important role in the economic development, it are attempting different learning approaches to enhance students X  learning experience. An example of these approaches includes collaborative learning. The success of the collaborative learning approach would be dep ended on students X  behavior and attitude towards knowledge and information sharing with their colleagues. 
For the case of the Thailand 4.0 initiative, it would require Thai educational institu-tions to prepare the necessities workforces to meet the rapid c hanges in the needs, tech-One of the possible approaches is for the Thai institutions to provide multidisciplinary education combining ICT together with other disciplines such as investment, financing, banking, business, medicine, engineering, and entertainment [ 2 , 5 ] . 
While there were a number of studies on factors associated with KS in an organiza-tional and a business context, only a few studies in an educational context especially from a multidisciplinary education has been identified [ 5 -8 ] . KS is an importance ele-ment for intellectual discourses; and a demanding task that requires time and effort from students [ 9 ] . Therefore, identifying behaviors that impact sharing of knowledge among students in learning communities especially the students from the multidisciplinary pro-grams is a critical task. Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented. 1.1 Purpose
The overall objectives of this study are to understand the sharing of knowledge be-haviors from a context of the undergraduate students from the multidisciplinary pro-grams within a private university in Thailand. The objective of this study is to investi-gate the sharing of knowledge behaviors from the following domains: (1) the general attitude towards knowledge sharing; (2) preferred sources for study -related a ctivitie s; (3) perceived frequency of knowledge sharing for study -relate d a ctivitie s ; (4) types of information and knowledge shared; (5) preferred channels for knowledge sharing; (6) knowledge sharing inhibitors ; and (7) knowledge sharing motivators. Knowledge is a highly valued asset and a crucial characteristic for the human beings and the organization X  X  existence. Knowledge is defined as the mixture of information and data alongside with the experience, expertise, opinions and skills owned by the individuals [ 10 ] . Thus, knowledge can be interpreted as information that has value and a part of a hierarchy of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. Knowledge is there-fore information by a one X  X  experi ences and insights within a context and contains an  X  X lement of reciprocity X  [ 9 , 11 ] .

As previously stated, sharing of knowledge or is an important ele ment for intellectual discourses. While it has an ability to improve a learning process of students, it should be influenced by students X  own willingness to engage. Nevertheless, students are ex-pected to be proactively responsible for their own education b y learning with both  X  X n-dividual responsibility X  and  X  X ommunal sharing X . Moreover, the main inhibitor in learn-ing is to encourage KS through social interaction. Students share knowledge and nego-tiate by what they meant. KS is the proces s where individuals mutually ex change their knowledge as well as create jointly new knowledge. Therefore, enhancing KS would provide a positive effect on student X  X  performance. However, students do not always exchange their knowledge between each other [ 6 , 9 ] .
 This study applied the sharing of knowledge behaviors of undergraduate students by Yuen and Majid [ 12 ] which claimed by Wei et al [ 13 ] to be the most comprehensive study. While the study by Yuen and Majid [ 12 ] examined the behaviors of undergrad-uate students in public universities in Singapore, the study by Wei et al [ 13 ] investigated the sharing patterns among private and public undergraduate students in Malaysia. Wei et al [ 13 ] also stated in their study th at fut ure studies should be con ducted between the students of different institutional types and other countries. 
It appears that the limited research on the sharing of knowledge behaviors has been conducted in Thailand especially from a perspective of the undergraduate students from the multidisciplinary programs within a private university. Thus, this study has applied the seven areas as identified by Yuen and Majid [ 12 ] with some contextual considera-tions as follows: (1) general attitude towards knowledge sharing; (2) preferred sources related a ctivitie s; (4) types of information and knowledge shared; (5) preferred channels fo r knowledge sharing; (6) knowledge sharing inhib itors ; and (7) knowledge sharing motivators (see Fig.1).
 Table 1 present s the mapping of sharing of knowledge behaviors and the existing liter-atures . 2.1 General Attitude towards Knowledge Sharing A ttitude of stude nts towards sharing of knowledge (A n ) comprises of twenty -one (21) items as follows: (A 1 ) I feel that my final grade is dependent on a great extent on the relative performance of my classmates; (A 2 ) I feel that my classmates have the potential find it easy to put what I know into words; (A 5 ) I am confident in my ability to provide knowledge to my classmates; (A 6 ) I am confident that my knowledge sharing would increase the p erformance of my classmates; (A 7 ) I am willing to share course materials with my classmates; (A 8 ) I am willing to discuss new ideas with my classmates; (A 9 ) I am willing to share knowledge that I acquire with my classmates; (A 10 ) My instructor supports us in sharing knowledge with other classmates; (A 11 ) My instructor encour-ages us to discuss with other classmates; (A 12 ) My instructor gives us a reward, such as verbal praise and score, when sharing knowledge with other classmates; (A 13 ) being satisfied; (A 15 ) Knowledge sharing is improving grade in exams; (A 16 ) There are some Information Technology (IT) tools available for shari ng knowledge such as email, web board , Line, and F acebook ; (A 17 ) I have an access to the Internet either at home or university; (A 18 ) I have experienced difficulties in accessing the existing communica-tion channel for sharing of knowledge; (A 19 ) IT makes it easier for me to share knowledge with my classmates; (A 20 ) IT makes it easier for me to have knowledge that is relevant to me; and (A 21 ) IT makes it easier for me to get in contact with my class-mates who have knowledge that is important to me [ 6 , 11 -16 ] .
 M oreover, these 21 items can be categorized into six (6) behavior group s (see Fig. 2) : (A 2.2 Preferred Sources for Study -Related Tasks (S student s; (S 5 ) Consult friend s outside the u niversity [ 12 , 13 ] . 2.3 Perceived Frequency of Knowledge Sha ring for Study -Related Tasks and (F 3 ) Working on group a ssignment s [ 12 , 13 ] . 2.4 Types of Information and Knowledge Shared T ypes of information and knowledge shared (T n ) comprises of five (5) items as follows: (T 1 ) By expressing their opinion on study -related matters ; (T 2 ) By providing answers to improve understanding of other students ; (T 3 ) By sharing Uniform Resource Loca-tor s (URL s ), of relevant websites ; (T 4 ) By providing examination related materials ; and (T 5 ) By providing their personal books and lecture notes [ 12 , 13 ] . 2.5 Preferred Channels for Knowledge Sharing Preferred channels for kn owledge sharing (C n ) comprises of three (3) items as follows: (C 1 ) Face to face; (C 2 ) Online chat (Facebook, Line); and (C 3 ) Telephone [ 1 , 11 -13 ] 2.6 Factors Limiting Knowledge Sharing Factors limiting knowledge sharing (L n ) comprises of seven (7) items as follows: (L 1 ) Lack of depth in relationship; (L 2 ) Afraid that others would perform better; (L 3 ) Do not want to be perceive as a show off; (L 4 ) Afraid to provide the wrong information; (L 5 ) Shy to provide own opinions; (L 6 ) Lack of time; and (L 7 ) Afraid that an opinion mis-match would offend others [ 12 , 13 , 16 , 18 ] . 2.7 Knowledge Sharing Motivators K nowledge sharing motivators (M n ) comprises of four (4) items as follows: (M 1 ) To learn from each other; (M 2 ) To help others; (M 3 ) Exchange or feedback; and (M 4 ) Self satisfaction [ 12 , 13 , 18 , 19 ] . Section 3 explain s the research methodology employed within this study. This study is a non -experimental, quantitative research applying a survey approach which follows Shanks et al X  X  [20] approac hes to research and scholarship . The ques tionnaire technique wa s selected amongst all other methods to collect data be cause it allows the participants to freely response , en sures anonymity in their conven ience time and location. Further-more , a survey approach is the m ost frequently used empirical re search method in IT research [20] . 3.1 Target Population The target population was all of the students under (1) Bachelor of Science Program in Medical Infor matics (MEI), (2) Bachelor of Science Program in Investment Informatics (INI), and (3) Bachelor of Science Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) in one of pri-and social network s . The data was collected over a period of two months , from January until February 201 7 . 3.2 The Instrument The instrument consists of two sections to obtain the response s from the participants. 
The first section used to coll ect the demographic information. They include gender, year level, Grade Point A verage (GPA), and academic programs. 
The second section consists of items measuring sharing of knowledge behaviors these items comprise of the students X  own attitude towards sharing of knowledge (A n ) ; 
The third section collected data on the types of knowledge shared (T n ) and channels responses by selecting statements on a con tinuum, from  X  strongly not agreeing  X  to  X  strongly agreeing  X  . The points can be given to the various responses and measures of central tendency variability, correlation, and other standard statistical m easures can be 3 =  X  neutral  X  , 4 =  X  agreed  X  , and 5 =  X  strongly agreed  X  .
 T he fort h section was on shari ng of knowledge inhibitors (L n ) and motivators (M n ).
T he questions used in the questionnaires were first developed in English. However, as English is not the official language in Thailand, some these participants may not be able to fu lly understand questions. Therefore, t he questions were presented in both Thai and English to avoid misinterpretation and miscommunication.
 The instrument was measured by three experts using the Index of Item Objective Congruence (IOC) to rate individual items on the degree to which they  X  do  X  or  X  do not  X  measure specific objectives. Each expert measured each item by giving the item a rating of  X 1 X  for clearly measuring,  X  0  X  degree to which it measu res the content area is unclear, and  X  -1 X  clearly not measu ring for each objectives. I tem rates above 0.5 were included [ 21 ] . 3.3 Data Analysis Methods In this study, the descriptive statistical techniques were used to describe the population researchers to characterize the population used in the study. S ection 4 reports on the details of the participants . 4.1 Characteristics of the Participants One hundred and twenty -three (123) student s were participated . These students were from Years 1 to 3 under (1) Bachelor of Science Program in Medical Informatics (MEI), (2) Bachelor of Science Program in Investment Informatics (INI), an d (3) Bachelor of Science Enter prise Information Systems (EIS) in a Thai private university. Table 2 pre-sents the details finding of the participants X  demographic.
 4.2 G eneral A ttitu de towards Knowledge S haring A mixture of positive and negative statements for understanding the participants X  gen-eral attitude towards sharing of knowledge were given (see, Table 3) . 
A majority of the participants (77. 3 per cent)  X  X trongly agreed X  or  X  X greed X  that sha r-ing knowledge with classmates would provide benefit s such as creating new knowledge result is supported by the responses from the participants that 69.1 per cent of t he par-my final grade is dependent on a great extent on the relative performance of my class-me X (A 2 ), and  X  I feel that my classmates are my competitors  X  (A 3 ).

T he finding also indicated that the participants were willing to share their materials (A 7 ), ideas (A 8 ) and knowledge (A 9 ) constituted of 87 per cent of the obtained  X  X trongly agree d X  or  X  X greed X  responses. Similarly, 85.1 per cent of the  X  X trongly agreed X  or participants X  general attitude towards sharing of knowledge. 
Moreover, while a majori ty of the participants (58.2 per cent)  X  X trongly agreed X  or  X  X greed X  that  X  X hey find it easy to put what they know into words  X  (A 4 ),  X  X hey are con-fident in their ability to provide knowledge to their classmates  X  (A 5 ), and  X  X hey are confident that their kno wledge sharing would increase the performance of their class-mates X  (A 6 ); many others did not voice their opinion.

It was inspiring to note that the participants overall possessed a positive attitude to-process. The participants discarded some misperceptions associated with sharing of knowledge which revealed their maturity and understanding.
 4.3 Preferred Sources for Study -Related Tasks The Internet (S 1 ) was the most preferred source for obtaining study -related infor-mation with the mean score 4.4 out of 5 , followed by Library (S 2 ) with the mean score of 3 . Consult other fellow student s (S 4 ) with the mean score 2.9, Consult lecturers (S 3 ) with the mean score 2.8, and Consult friend s outsid e the u niversity (S 5 ) with the mean score 2.5 were ranked third, fourth and fifth preferred sources. It appeared that stu-dents realize the fact that their classmate s, probably due to common understanding of the task, were one of the most useful sources in obtaining study -related information and knowledge after the Internet and Library . 4.4 Perceived Frequency of Knowledge Sharing for Study -Related Tasks A majority (54.5 per cent) of the participant stated that they  X  X requently X  share knowledge with other studen ts during  X  working on group assignments  X  (F 3 ), followed by  X  working on individual assignments  X  (F 2 ) at 27.6 per cent. However, 22 (17.9 per cent) of the participants felt that they may share knowledge  X  X ess frequently X  while working in tutorials/labs (F 1 ) . 4.5 Types of Information and Knowledge Shared 30.1 per cent of the participants voiced that often knowledge sharing is done via shar-ing URLs of relevant websites (T 3 ). T hree other possible knowledge sharing venue s were : expressing their opinion on study -relat ed matters (T 1 ) at 23.6 per cent , provid-ing examination related materials (T 4 ) at 19.5 per cent , and providing answers to im-prove understanding of other students (T 2 ) at 17.1 per cent . Not surprising. Only 9.8 per cent believed that knowledge is shared thr ough providing their personal books and lecture notes (T 5 ). 4.6 Preferred Channels for Knowledge Sharing The participants identified that face to face communication (C 1 ) with the mean score 4.4 out of 5, and online chat (C 2 ) with the mean score of 4.3 were the top two most preferred methods of sharing knowledge; with the telephone (C 3 ) with the mean score of 2.2 being least preferred. It is noted that the face to face communication was proba-bly preferred because it delivers prompt feedback, help obtain clarific ations, and offer non -verbal indications. 4.7 Factors Limiting Knowledge Sharing The majority of the participants (61 per cent) believed that Lack of depth in relation-ship (L 1 ) was the main factor preventing an active knowledge sharing by their class-mates. Thi s was followed by Afraid to provide the wrong information (L 4 ) at 13.8 per cent, Afraid that others would perform better (L 2 ) at 11.4 per cent, Shy to provide own opinions (L 5 ) at 4.9 per cent, and Do not want to be perceive as a show off (L 3 ) at 4.1 per c ent. Lack of time (L 6 ) and Afraid that an opinion mismatch would offend others (L 7 ) were equally ranked at 2.4 per cent. 4.8 Knowledge Sharing Motivators The two main driver for knowledge sharing among the participant were the intention to learn from each ot her (M 1 ) at 59.4 per cent, followed by the willing to help others (M 2 ) at 26 per cent. The e xchange or feedback (M 3 ) was ranked the third at 10.6 per cent. Only 4.1 per cent indicated that self satisfaction (M 4 ) was their motivation. A critical element of effective and meaningful learning at the undergraduate level re-quires voluntarily and a ctive sharing of knowledge among the students. For Thailand join the workforce after finishing their undergraduate studies, must be equipped with a positive attitude towards sharing of knowledge. Sharing of knowledge would allow stu-dents to be more valuable to their employing organizations. The findings from this study ind icated that the participants were willing t o learn from as well as to help each source of knowledge . It is also noted that the participants presented a positive attitude towards knowledge sharing. However, l ack of depth in relationship and a fraid to pro-vide the wrong information were the two main inhibitors preventing an active knowledge sharing by the Thai students. considers some of these together with a number of possible directions for further re-search. The first, and most obvious, limitation concerns the issue of bias and represen-tatio n. In this study, the survey population used may not be representative of all Thai extend the survey to other Thai universities who were not surveyed.

Descriptive statist ic was the major data analysis technique used in this study. How-ever, the descriptive statistic technique is restricted to characterize the population terms of frequencies, means, and standard deviations. Other techniques exist, such as factor analysis, mu ltiple regression analysis and path analysis. I t would be an interesting area of future work to examine an analysis based on such approaches
