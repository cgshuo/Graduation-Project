 Many things influence human deci sion-making in disasters. This work considers the information management needs and collaborative work of those focused on animal care and evacuation in disasters. Empirical ethnographic work on-site at two animal evacuation locations, as well as fieldwork responding to large animal needs, and ongoing participant observer fieldwork between events has led to both academic and practical contributions aimed at improving the ways animal advocates, animal owners and emergenc y responders are able to communicate and attend to the needs of animals and their owners in a disaster.

In a disaster, people may make decisions about whether to evacuate or stay based on their ability to take their animals. People re-enter disaster zones to retrieve pets before officials for owners, particularly for the most vulnerable in society X  X he elderly and children. [2,7,3] Following 2005 X  X  Hurricane Katrina, when tens of thousands of pets and service animals were left to perish, the US Government passed The Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act (2006), known as the PETS Act [8]. The Act serves to provide financial support to responders who evacuate service and companion animals alongside their owners. While effective, there are still huge challenges for people who are concerned with animals in disasters. For exam ple, the Act does not provide ranch owner throughout the evacuation, audio recording conversations between her and the responding volunteer horsepeople. I took nearly 200 photographs and interviewed seven volunteers who had been active in the evacuation, two officials, the Ranch owners and employees, using the photographs as probes. I also reviewed persona l email correspondence and social media posts related to the evacuation. Ethnographic fieldwork forms the centerpiece of my dissertation. Its analysis provides the theoretical orientation that has informed my creative work in design and development of tools aimed at supporting the information needs of those concerned with animals in disasters. The work I have produced has been informed by continuing engagement with these responding communities. I have completed numerous FEMA tr aining modules, and am a recognized volunteer member of the Douglas/Elbert County Community Animal Response Team , and a credentialed member of the Colorado Veterinary Medical Reserve Corps. My experience, training and data collection have informed the following studies. In 2012, I worked with two colleagues at Project EPIC to design a tool focused on reuniting animals with owners after a disaster, called Emergency PetMatcher (EPM ). The application design was intended to support crowdwork in recommending matches between lost and found pets displaced in disasters. We conducted user tests, and iterated the design. The design received 4th place in the CHI2012 Student Design Competition. EPM is being readied for deployment in Fall 2014 X  X  hurricane season. The data collection on the Hurricane Sandy Lost and Found Pets page led to the CSCW2014 paper,  X  X igital Mobilization in Disaster Response: The Work a nd Self-Organization of On-Line Pet Advocates in Response to Hu rricane Sandy X  [10]. The paper X  X  contributions built upon previously seen online digital volunteer behavior [eg, 9] and activism [e g, 6], and provided insight to motivations of volunteers concerne d with animals. We observed animal advocates pivot their usual foci on a range of pet issues to the needs of animals that were a direct result of the disaster. Admins of the Page used the al bums feature of the Facebook Page as a content management system where animal flyers could be organized according to species, lost and found, and location. Users were able to use the comment thread attached to each photograph to suggest matches between lost and found pets displaced by the disaster. The aim of the Page was to reunite as many pets as possible, and re home those pets who had to be relinquished due to the devastating effect of the hurricane on families. My experiences and data collection at two animal evacuation sites during the 2013 Black Forest Fire informed an opportunity to conduct a participatory design exercise. Most counties in Colorado have agreements with local Fairgrounds and other animal-focused centers that state in the event of a disaster, animals being evacuated may be sheltered there. While the public may be familiar with these locati ons in non-disaster times, there These maps will help prevent gridlo ck of horse trailers and other vehicles as they converge onto the Fairgrounds sites. Additionally, Colorado State officials are interested in replicating this work to other county fairgrounds. This work included the creation of standardized map symbols specific to animal evacuations. We noted there are no standardized symbols relevant to animal evacuation centers, so these were also iterated upon, and have been submitted to The Noun Project and ReliefWeb for open access use in other humanitarian mapping endeavors. I continue to be a trained responder on the ground in the event of an animal evacuation, and in a lo cal event will gather data on the application of the maps we have produced. I have begun working on a high-fidelity prototype of an animal evacuation CMS and mobile phone app that will assist with the intake, shelter care and release of animals at an evacuation site (Figure 3). Animals brought to a site are identified via paperwork, which may be destroyed over the course of an evacuation. The Animal Evacuation Management Tool will make it easy to link an animal with its paperwork, without needi ng to keep paper at the stall. It will also provide realtime monitoring of animals while they are on site and is designed to levera ge additional functions such as realtime reporting on collected data to provide the Emergency Operations Center with information about all the animals at each evacuation site, without state and federal officials having to call to check with barn managers. The tool will complement the paper-based systems already in use at animal evacuation centers, and provide a robust information architecture to support the needs of workers and owners during an evacuation event.
