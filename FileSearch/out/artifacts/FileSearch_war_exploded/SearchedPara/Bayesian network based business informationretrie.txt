 Zheng Wang  X  Qing Wang  X  Ding-Wei Wang Abstract The quality of business information can significantly affect the operation level of enterprise. This paper analyses the problem of business information retrieval (BIR). A Bayesian Network Based business information retrieval model (BN-BIRM) is proposed by is expressed in terms of the predefined illustrative documents related to business domain. The similarities between the documents and the query are evaluated with the conditional probabilities among the nodes in the BN. In the experiments, BN-BIRM is compared with the Belief Network model based on vector space model (VSM) ranking strategy and the Inference Network model based on TF-IDF ranking strategy. The experimental results show that BN-BIRM is effective for collecting business information on a large scale.

Enterprises need more and more decision-making on business management. Hence, it is crucial for an enterprise to be able prehensively and in time, which is the basis of the success in any EC activity [ 14 ].
In traditional commerce environment, business information retrieval (BIR) is based on dealing with traditional media by handwork, such as radio, TV, newspaper, magazine, etc. evolved.

At present, there are two major methods for searching business information. 1. Searching with some large EC websites such as http://www.amazon.com , http://www. 2. Searching with General-purpose Search Engines (GSE) such as  X  X oogle X ,  X  X ahoo! X , management, this paper analyzes the problem of business information retrieval. A Bayesian network (BN) based business information retrieval model (BN-BIRM) is proposed. In this model, considering the drawbacks of the above two methods, the Web pages returned from documents for searching (the Web pages returned from GSEs) are defined as the nodes in BN. The similarities between documents and the query can be evaluated by calculating the searching are ranked so that valuable business information required by enterprises can be extracted.
 This work is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review related to Information information retrieval model based on Bayesian network (BN-BIRM). The similarity expres-sion is analyzed in theory and a method for query adaptation is given. Section 4 presents experimental results with BN-BIRM. Finally, conclusions and suggestions for future work are given. 2 Related work enterprise query requirements in terms of precision and recall rates.

The BIR problem in the huge Internet resource is equivalent to the problem of domain-specific information retrieval on Web. The searching domain is about business information concerned by enterprises (e.g., automobile manufacturers are concerned about the informa-tion related to automobile).

Domain-specific information retrieval can be implemented by combining the text cat-domain-specific keywords are selected to describe the features and the query requirements for the domain. Gao et al. [ 12 ] proposed a simple method of text mining to automatically ness information retrieval. Sheng and Jiang [ 27 ] constructed a Hopfield network by local context analysis, where a group of domain-specific keywords generated automatically by Hopfield network are used for query expansion. Oyama et al. [ 22 ] built a domain-specific search engine simply by adding domain-specific expression, called  X  X eyword spices X , to the ing the use of the latent semantic approach in the automatic generation of hypertext links among information contained in web repositories. Lee and Soo [ 17 ] introduced a framework are good reference for business information retrieval.
 and Muntz [ 24 ] have used BN to model evidence derived from past queries and to combine it with the vector space model (VSM). The formalism of BN provided a sound framework for representing, quantifying, and combining two or more sources of evidence in support of a ranking for the documents in the answer set. Fung and Del Favero [ 11 ] applied BN to approach was that semantic relationships between topics could be specified. Heckerman and a user query. Their Bayesian network established a casual relationship between help topics and the query terms.

The above systems use terms and content in documents as evidences in BN. Recently, link information becomes important and it has been use to rank documents in Web information systems [ 4 ]. Brin and Page [ 3 ] proposed an algorithm, named Page-Rank, which used the Web link structure to derive a measure of popularity for Web pages. A page was recursively defined as popular when it was linked by many other popular pages. Kleinberg [ 16 ] later proposed the HITS algorithm, where pages assumed two distinct functions: hub and author-ity. A good hub page linked to many good authority pages. Recursively, a good authority page was linked by many good hub pages. Silva et al. [ 28 ] provided a framework for com-bining information extracted from the content of the documents with information derived and analyze the advantages of each alternative.

Although Bayesian networks are increasingly being used to solve many problems, its (NPTs). A key challenge is to construct relevant NPTs using the minimal amount of expert designed a new method for eliciting probabilities from experts that combines the ideas of defining NPTs for a large class of commonly occurring nodes (called ranked nodes). The approach is based on the doubly truncated Normal distribution with a central tendency that is invariably a type of weighted function of the parent nodes.

However, in the BN based IR models, conditional probabilities are elicited according to the index information of individual document. The NPTs are constructed automatically by computer system but not by domain experts. The calculation method of NPTs will be given in the later sections.

The problem of BIR is different from domain-specific information retrieval in the follow-ing aspects: 1. Business information contains much information about products, customers, suppliers, 2. The vague boundary of domains and the constantly varying requirements of enterprises In this paper the proposed BN-BIRM is different from the previous works in two directions. terms layer and documents layer [ 24 ]. In BN-BIRM a layer of illustrative document nodes query and documents [ 5 ]. In BN-BIRM the illustrative document nodes are employed as root nodes to describe the customized query requirements, instead of domain-specific keywords. 3 Bayesian network based business information retrieval model 3.1 Design of BN-BIRM The network in Fig. 1 shows BN-BIRM, where nodes represent pieces of information. Each 1 means that the corresponding information will be taken into account in our computation. In this case, we say the information was observed. 3.1.1 Nominal definitions  X  Customized Query Requirements of enterprise (CQR): q
Since the purpose of BN-BIRM is to collect sufficient business information to support the decision-making on business management, q represents the emphasis of business information information about  X  X ngine X  are emphasized for collection. q does not change frequently but on Internet. Therefore, the CQR is different from the common user query keyword. Node q 0 indicates q is not under consideration.  X  Illustrative documents set: c Illustrative documents denote the Web pages regarding information in the business domain. Suppose that the pages have been collected from Internet by enterprise. For the purpose of means of weight setting for each illustrative document according to q , the BN-BIRM can the Bayesian network.  X  Index terms: k
Index terms reflect the features of documents and can be used to describe the relation between illustrative documents and the documents for searching. Some nouns and important selection methods such as information gain (IG), mutual information (MI), odds ratio (OR), k taking value 1 indicates the index term i appears in documents.  X  Documents for searching: d
Considering some domain-specific keywords as the input query of GSE, a large number of retrieved Web pages by GSE are defined as the documents for searching. For example, an automobile manufacturer may use  X  X ar X ,  X  X ngine X , etc. as the domain-specific keywords and submit them to GSE. The Web pages retrieved by GSE are a group of documents for searching. The effective business information will be selected from the documents group by means of calculating the similarity between q and d j . d j denotes the document j for searching, j = 1 ... n . n is the total number of documents for searching. Node d j taking judgment whether it is relevant to the domain of business information or not. 3.1.2 Similarity calculation c g ( c ) = 1  X  c l  X  u .Thereare2 m possible states for c [ 24 ].
 where k i  X  { 0 , 1 } .If k i = 1, then g i k = 1. There are 2 t possible states for k . Assumption In BN-BIRM, P d j | q is employed as the similarity of the document d j with respect to the query q ,where d j and q are short representations for d j = 1and q = 1, respectively. P d j | q reflects the degree of coverage provided to d j by q . According to the network in Fig. 1 and Bayesian theorem, P d j | q can be calculated as follows: constant, so that
To clarify the principle of BN-BIRM and how to calculate each conditional probability in ( 1 ), BN-BIRM is separated into two sub-models: similarity model and relation model. 3.1.3 Similarity model q ,thatis, P d j | q . The arcs in Fig. 2 are directed from node c l to node q and d j .  X   X  d j for searching is also associated with a vector c composed of the illustrative documents. Therefore, the similarity between d j and q can be interpreted as a matching relationship between vectors.

The illustrative document node c l logically separates the nodes q and d j and makes them mutually independent. According to the Bayesian theorem, thus, and
Define illustrative document nodes in the query node q is defined as represents the emphasis of business information for collection. For example, suppose that an automobile manufacturer wants to collect the business information about  X  X ngine X . The w w lq will be between  X 1 X  and  X 0 X . The value of w lq is designated by experts of enterprise according to the CQR.
 can not be calculated with the method similar to ( 3 ). 3.1.4 Relation model To calculate P d j | ments are added between the nodes of document for searching and the nodes of illustrative document so as to establish a relation between d j and c l . As a result, P d j | calculated. The arcs in Fig. 3 are directed from node c l through node k i to node d j .
The index terms can reflect the features of document and can be selected by different is applied to select index terms [ 32 ].

Figure 3 shows that d j is represented as a t -dimensional vector composed of index terms,  X   X  d g composed of illustrative documents, k appears in document c l ,then g l
The index term nodes k i logically separates the nodes c l and d j and makes them mutually independent. According to the Bayesian theorem, thus,
Define  X   X  k index term nodes in document d j for searching [ 24 ] can be defined as frequency of occurrence of the index term i in the document j .The id f i = log m m i is the inverse document frequency for index term i ,and m i is the number of illustrative documents in which index term i appears.
With respect to conditional probability P k | c , according to the Bayesian theorem each index term nodes k i is mutually independent. The influence associated to each index term node k i with the illustrative document nodes c l can be computed separately. As a result, P k | c can be computed in the product form.
 where the conditional probability of each index term is defined as number of distinct index terms in the illustrative document l [ 23 ].

The inverse term frequency reflects the influence of document to index term. If a term appears in two documents and the occurrence frequency of the term in the two documents than the other document with more distinct index terms. Considering w ij in ( 5 )and w li it f respect to the query q can be expressed as
P d j | q  X  3.1.5 Structure analysis of the two models as the subsets of the sample space of domain-specific keywords. However, the middle layer where q and d j are modeled as subsets of sample space C and associated with illustrative domain, which can overcome the drawbacks of using domain-specific keywords and make the similarity model suitable for BIR.
 Inference network model implements the inference process from the document nodes for searching to query node through index term nodes. However, to calculate P d j | the inference process are different, but the principles of calculation are alike.
Combining similarity model in Fig. 2 with relation model in Fig. 3 , BN-BIRM can be ( 1 ) is the same as calculated by ( 2 )and( 4 ). 3.2 Analysis of similarity expression in theory document l ,definedas w l =  X  all illustrative documents. By defining W ( 9 ) can be expressed as with two m -dimensional vectors.

Let the CQR to business domain, document l in query q . Let index term documents, index term i . Similarly, let document of illustrative documents, defined as illustrative document l in the document j , W lj =  X  i W ij  X  W li .

According to the principle of VSM, the similarity of document to query can be calculated by inner product of the document vector and the query vector. Thus, sim ( q , d j )  X  the two models are equal in value.

Bayesian network is a framework of IR models, which may subsume various IR models [ 2 ]. Inference network can be tuned to subsume Boolean model and belief network can be tuned to subsume VSM. Hence, in this paper BN-BIRM subsumes an improved VSM. 3.3 Adaptation of customized query requirement q necessary to adapt the query q and associated w lq to the sustained changes.
Relevance feedback can be used for query adaptation [ 26 ]. In this paper, if the query q has changed, the w lq may adapt automatically to the retrieval results.

Let D be the set of retrieved documents, and | D | be the number of documents. w r jq is the weight of retrieved document j ,0  X  w r jq  X  1. The w r jq is designated by experts in enterprise, which reflects the similarity between the retrieved document and the changed update expression of w lq is given by where  X  and  X  are the parameters for tuning, 0 &lt; X &lt; 10 &lt; X &lt; 1  X  +  X  = 1.
Updated with ( 12 ), the adaptive w lq will be more suitable for the changes in CQR, which can provide enterprises more valuable and up-to-date business information. searched based on the new parameters. 4 Experiments and discussion The documents for the experiments are selected from USE-NET newsgroups, which are also There are 100 documents selected from the  X  car  X  domain and defined as the illustrative documents, where 50 documents are relevant to  X  American car  X  and the other documents are relevant to  X  Japanese car  X . The rest 1900 documents are defined as the documents for searching. The documents in  X  X ar X  domain are supposed as the searching target. The details of documents for experiments are shown in Table 2 . 4.1 Experiments for comparisons with other models In this section, BN-BIRM is compared with inference network model and belief network model. There are 600 documents for searching in  X  car  X  domain, which are supposed as the used for query evaluation.

Compared to BN-BIRM, inference network model and belief network model do not have searching are employed as the root nodes. In belief network model, index terms are defined as the root nodes.

In the two models, some domain-specific keywords are selected as index terms to describe the query and documents, such as  X  X ngine X ,  X  X ar X ,  X  X arket X ,  X  X rice X , etc. TF-IDF method is ranking strategy in the belief network [ 24 ].
 The retrieval results are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 4 .

Ta b l e 3 summarizes the experiment results using BN-BIRM. With respect to 600 retrieved which are higher than the other two models. Hence, most of the documents in the result are in the business domain. The precision rate of BN-BIRM on average is 27.6% higher than the belief network model and 10.6% higher than the inference network model. The recall rate on average is also 16.1 and 3.9% higher than the other two models, respectively.
Figure 4 shows that when recall rate is below 90%, the precision rate of BN-BIRM is also higher than the others with regard to the same recall rate.

BN-BIRM uses illustrative documents related to business domain to describe the CQR instead of domain-specific keywords used in inference network model and belief network information on a large scale. 4.2 Experiments for query adaptation now concerns about the documents relevant to  X  X merican car X  in  X  X ar X  domain. As a result, among the 1900 documents for searching the 300 documents relevant to  X  X merican car X  become the search target of BIR.

In the experiment the parameter values are empirically set as:  X  = 0.7 , X  = 0 . 3and |
D | = 30. If the retrieved document j is relevant to  X  X merican car X , then w r After updating w lq with (12), the values of w lq are shown in Table 4.
 Ta b l e 4 shows that the values of w lq can automatically adapt to the change in the CQR. The retrieval results are shown in Table 5 and Fig. 5 .

Ta b l e 5 shows the experiment results of BN-BIRM before and after adaptation. Consider-on average are 12.8 and 5% higher than that before adaptation, respectively. Compared to It indicates that the documents with higher similarity to the domain of  X  X merican car X  can rapidly be ranked at the top by means of the adaptation of q .
 q iteratively the retrieval performance will be improved further. 5 Conclusion and future work on Internet. BN-BIRM is proposed by means of BN and IR theory. A method for query adaptation is presented. The experiments show the performance of BN-BIRM is better than The method for query adaptation is effective to the changes of CQR. BN-BIMR can also be mass of information resources.

This paper employs the content in documents as evidence in BN. Considering the business information is stored in the Web, link information may be more important for searching business information. Future work on this subject may focus on combing link-based evidence and content-based evidence in BN together to find more and valuable business information. References Author Biographies
