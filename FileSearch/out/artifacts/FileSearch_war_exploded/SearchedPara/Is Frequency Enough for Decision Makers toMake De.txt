 Frequent itemsets mining is one of the fundamental research topics in data mining and is rooted in market basket analysis [Roddick&amp;Rice 2001][Wang et al 2001]. A frequent itemset is actionable if its support is greater than or equal to a user-specified threshold, called a minimum support, denoted  X  . For example, ( { beer, diaper } , 0.15%) is a frequent itemset i n a transactional dataset when  X  =0 . 1%. Data marketers and decisi on-makers are interested in knowing how to evaluate the frequency of an itemset, for example { beer, diaper } .

In order to provide more informatio n sources for decision makers to effec-tively make decisions, in this paper, we propose novel approaches to report sta-tistical itemset parameters . We specify summary queries ( statistical parameters), namely, 1) finding a support-average of itemsets, 2) finding a support-quantile of itemsets, 3) finding the number of itemsets that greater/less than the support-quantile, i.e., an approximated distribution of itemsets, and 4) finding the fre-quentness of an itemset. Taken the itemset, { beer, diaper } ,asanexample.We can provide a decision maker the follo wing information. The frequency of { beer, diaper } is greater than the support-quantile. The number of itemsets that have a support less than the support-average is more than the number of itemsets that have a support greater than the support-average. In addition, we can also provide a frequentness of the itemset if al l frequent itemsets, their supports are greater than  X  , are normalized into a range of [0,1].

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the problem state-ment is given with an example. Section 3 reports the results of our experimental studies. We conclude this paper in Section 4. of items I , X  X  I .Let I be the set of all possible non-empty itemsets of I .The size of I is then 2 N  X  1. A transactional dataset D is a set of transactions where a transaction is a set of items. Let the number of transactions in D that contain an itemset X be s ( X ). The support of an itemset, X , is defined as sup ( X )= s ( X ) / | D | .Anitemset X is a frequent itemset, if and only if sup ( X )  X   X  ,where  X  is a threshold called a minimum support threshold.

We call an itemset, X , effective ,if sup ( X ) &gt; 0. Let s min and s max be the minimum and maximum supports of all possible effective itemsets in D , respec-tively, then s min  X  sup ( X )  X  s max . It is important to note that s min is the minimum value of effective itemsets in D and is different from the minimum support threshold,  X  , which is a user-given parameter.

In the literature, the problem of frequent itemsets mining is to find the com-plete set of frequent itemsets in a given transactional dataset with respect to a given support threshold,  X  . In this paper, we do not discuss how to efficiently mine frequent itemsets. Instead, we focus ourselves on how to efficiently answer the summary queries. Let N be the number of effective itemsets existing in a transactional dataset D . Four summary queries are given below.
 Support-average query: We consider how to find the average of supports for all effective itemsets, X ,in D , which is defined below. Note: the minimum support threshold  X  is not used.
 Support-quantile query: Let IS be the set of itemsets in dataset D . For any itemset A in IS , assume and It is commonsense that an itemset B is frequent (or large) in D if | IS This means that if B is frequent in D , then the support of most itemsets in IS is lesser than that of B .Wetakethisasthe first support constraint of frequent itemsets.

From this first constraint, there is a support quantile, written to s quan ,such and That is, Support-lean query: We consider a distribution of all effective itemsets in D , called an itemset distribution . In an itemset distribution for a transactional dataset D , the x-axis represents supports in the range of s min and s max ,and the y-axis shows the number of effective itemsets that have the corresponding support given in the x-axis. The median of supports in the x-axis is ( s min + s max ) / 2. We want to know the position of s avg in the itemset distribution, and introduce a notion called lean , denoted L .
 where, L  X  is the number of effective itemsets, X  X  X  , whose support is less than s avg in the transactional dataset D ,and L + is the number of effective itemsets, X  X  X  , whose support is greater than s avg in the transactional dataset D . In other words, when L  X  = L + , L =0and s avg = s quan ;when L  X  &gt;L + , L&gt; 0and s avg &gt;s quan ;andwhen L  X  &lt;L + , L&lt; 0and s avg &lt;s quan .We call the itemsets distribution of D left gradient when L&gt; 0, and right gradient when L&lt; 0, respectively. Like the support-average and support-quantile queries, support-lean query is irrelevant to  X  .
 Relative-support query: We consider a relative fre quency query with respect to a minimum support threshold. In detail, given a minimum threshold,  X  ,we can find all frequent itemsets, X ,  X   X  sup ( X )  X  s max .Ifwetake sup ( X )=0for those itemsets, X ,suchas sup ( X ) &lt; X  ,andtake sup ( X ) = 1 for those itemsets, X ,suchas sup ( X )= s max , what is the relative minimum support sup ( X ), for any itemsets X found in between. In other words, it normalizes the supports of itemsets in [  X , s max ]onto[0 , 1]. We model it as  X  ( X,  X  ). Here,  X  ( X,  X  )=0if sup ( X ) &lt; X  ,  X  ( X,  X  )=1if sup ( X )= s max ,andany  X  ( X,  X  ) is between 0 and 1. Example 1. Let I = { a, b, c, d, e } . Suppose there is a transactional dataset with 2 bd , be , cd , ce , de , abd , bcd , bce , bde , cde , bcde } . The minimum and maximum support, s min and s max ,are 0 . 2 (the support of bcde ), and 0 . 8 (the support of d ), respectively. Note: the set of non-effective itemsets, for example, includes ae , Because L =(12  X  7) / 19 , the transactional dataset is left gradient. It implies that more itemsets have a support less than the support-average value s avg =0 . 33 . The problems of processing the above four summary queries are important, because they provide global information for users to understand the transac-tional dataset to be mined and to select a proper minimum support threshold to mine. The problems are also challenging, because the computation costs are high. For example, the first three, support-average, support-quantile and support-lean queries, do not use the minimum-support threshold,  X  . Therefore, the pruning techniques used in frequent itemsets mining can not be effectively used. The last requests high computational overhead after frequent itemsets mining. In this pa-per, we emphasize on approximations for the three summary queries (see next section for the efficiency). We evaluate our testing results using a relative error rate, ,suchas =  X  E  X  E ) /E ,where E is the true value and  X  E is the approximated value. We use a real dataset taken from UCI/CENSUS-INCOME, denoted TDB 1 .
 The number of transactions in TDB 1 is 32,562, and the number of items is 104. We selected 9 attributes (2, 4, 6-10, 14, 15) from TDB 1 . The average size of frequent itemsets is 6. We take a simple, D 1 ,where | D 1 | =1 , 612. The sample size is 5% of the real dataset.
 We use the sample D 1 to approximate the itemset distribution in TDB 1 .
We show the itemset distribution in Fig. 1 using four subfigures where the itemsets with support less than 2 are omitted. Here, for simplicity, we use the actual count, s ( X ), instead of the support sup ( X ) for an itemset X .Fig.1 (a), (b), (c) and (c) show the count ranges in 2-9, 10-40, 40-79, and 80-250, respectively.
 We have considered four summary queries, and we provide approximation solu-tions. The new techniques proposed unl eash the power of frequent itemsets by providing useful statistical parameters. As shown in our experimental studies, our approximation solutions can achieve high satisfactory level for answering the four summary queries efficiently.
