 fi ed systematically. The CO problems of GL are further studied with SI 1. Introduction
Global warming, environment deterioration, and government regulations arouse the awareness of academic researchers and indus-trial practitioners for considering the  X  green  X  strategies in logistics industry ( Murphy, 2000 ). Green Logistics (GL) concerns not only the provision of green products or se rvices to customers, but also the overall logistics fl ow of items from cradle to grave, together with reverse logistics. Various green activities and operations have been implemented, such as production scheduling and network construc-tion. In order to improve the performance of GL, individual logistics parties not only need to implement green activities and operations by themselves, but also the cooperation and collaboration among differ-ent logistics parties ( Zhou et al., 2000 ). The performance of GL cannot be measured simply in an economic way, but in a sustainable way taking account of environmental and societal factors as well, which are also the objectives of GL ( Bj X rklund et al., 2012; Hervani et al., 2005 ).
GL can be understood as the combination of traditional logistics and reverse logistics (RL). Traditional logistics comprises the raw materials to fi nished products, while RL is a rather new research fi eld, which involves the concept of recycling used products in order to reduce waste and to increase an industry's performance and resulting pro fi ts. RL is of great importance, as it not only complements integrated logistics research, but also improves the performance of GL signi fi cantly in terms of all the economic, environmental and societal objectives ( Lee and Lam, 2012 ). RL also consists of numerous activities and operations, such as returned products collection, exam-ination, pre-processing, recycling, remanufacturing or disposal ( Rogers and Tibben-Lembke, 2001 ).

Most of the activities and operations in GL can be formulated as combinatorial optimization (CO) models with multiple objectives, constraints and decision variables. Exact methods, such as Linear Programming (LP) and Branch-and-Bound (B&amp;B), are becoming less popular for solving CO problems, as they are either unable to solve complicated CO problems with large numbers of variables or it takes long time to fi nd the solution for CO problems ( Laporte, 1992 ). By contrast, meta-heuristic approaches are becoming increasingly pop-ular as these approaches are approximate approaches, which suggest that they could fi nd satisfactory solution swithinanacceptable time instead of fi nding the optimal solution. Intuitively speaking, meta-heuristic approaches can be classi fi ed into two categories: the single-solution based approach es and the population based appro-aches ( Blum and Roli, 2003 ). The single-solution based approaches, also named the trajectory methods ( Consoli and Darby-Dowman, 2007 ), such as Tabu Search (TS), Simulated Annealing (SA) and various local search methods, in that only one candidate solution exists during the whole search process. However, the population based approach indicates that the search process starts with a population of candidate choices, and the whole population further evolves. The advantages and disadvantages of both the single-solution based approaches and the population based approaches can be found in the literature ( Glover and Kochenberger, 2003; Jones et al., 2002 ). Two important examples of the population based approach are Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Swarm intelligence (SI). The most typical example of EAs is the Genetic Algorithm (GA), which was proposed by Holland in 1975 and simulates the Darwin evolution concept ( Holland, 1975 ).

SI approaches were originally inspired by the collective beha-vior of natural species, such as ant colony optimization (ACO) from ants, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) from birds and the
Arti fi cial Bee Colony (ABC) from bees ( Bonabeau et al., 1999 ). SI is a relatively new branch of meta-heuristics comparing with EAs and other single-solution based approaches. SI approaches use approximate and non-deterministic strategies to effectively and ef fi ciently explore and exploit the search space in order to near-optimal solutions ( Blum and Li, 2008; Blum and Merkle, 2008 ). SI has three fundamental and essential properties, namely decentralization, self-organization and collective behavior, which are necessary and suf fi cient to acquire SI behaviors. Decentraliza-tion means that no central control mechanism exists. The beha-viors of individuals are determined by themselves. And the self-organization of individual relies upon four fundamental proper-ties, i.e. positive feedback, negative feedback, fl uctuations and multiple interactions ( Jeanne, 1986 ). The interaction between two individuals or environment follows simple rules. The result from interaction would either impel or restrain the behavior of certain individual as positive feedback or negative feedback. The decision of certain individual might be affected by some random factors, which leads to fl uctuations. Collective behavior refers that in a swarm, the individual behavior may act randomly, however the aggregation of individual behavior turns to be globally intelligent.
In other words, SI indicates that a number of cognitive individuals accumulate their knowledge through the interaction with other individuals or the environment, determine their behaviors solely and fi nally achieve the target. The characteristics and details of each SI approach are presented in Section 4 .

Ever since the introduction of SI, various SI algorithms have been proposed and applied to solve the CO problems in multifarious disciplines, among which the domain of GL could be a promising research area due to its inherent characteristics and features. How-ever, given that there have been many researches of solving GL problems using SI algorithms. Most of them are individually sepa-rated, either solving an independent GL problem or adopting a single
SI algorithm. In this regard, a comprehensive and extensive literature review of the integration of GL and SI from both the problem context and the methodology perspective is needed urgently. In this research, the state-of-the-art applications of the SI algorithms in the GL background are fully investigated and analyzed, and can help researchers to obtain an intuitive and profound understanding of current research situations. In addi tion, considering the implementa-tion of various SI algorithms and their variants, this research also provides innovative and universal pr inciples of algorithm selection, improvement and even customizat ion through detailed algorithm analysis and comparison, which can offer practical guidance when solving CO problems using SI related algorithms.

After a brief introduction, the research methodology, i.e. the process of literature review, is described in Section 2 .Theclassi schemes of GL and SI are presented in Sections 3 and 4 respectively.
Section 5 discusses the integration of GL and SI and the guiding principles of choosing and optimizing algorithms for speci is presented Finally, Section 6 concludes the work and suggests research opportunities and directions for further work. 2. Research methodology interdisciplinary research in GL and SI, and thereafter, to classify and integrate them so as to discover gaps, critical issues and opportunities for further study and research. The literature review is a valid approach and necessary step in exploring new research directions and forms an integral part of the related research, which also helps to scrutinize the conceptual aspects and guides the research toward new theoretical development ( Meredith, 1993;
Seuring and M X ller, 2008 ). The literature review is conducted for content analysis, where quantitative and qualitative aspects are reviewed to assess the context as well as the content ( Brewerton and Millward, 2001 ). The process of this literature review follows the four-step process model proposed by Mayring (2004) ; material collection, descriptive analysis, category selection, and material evaluation, described in Fig. 1 , and the review process is carried out accordingly.
 targeted publications should mostly comprise operational-level CO models, e.g. transportation problems, network design problems, production scheduling problem, etc. solved by SI related approaches.
With this consideration, the following databases were selected for a comprehensive and extensive review of this interdisciplinary research: IEEE/IEE Electronic Library via IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect by Elsevier, Scopus, and SpingerLink. In addi tion to those databases, Google Scholar was also used to compleme nt the related publications.

The top 8 journals contribute to 50% of the whole publications. Fig. 2 shows the distribution pattern from a timeline perspective, in accord with the chronological order of their initial introduction. The publication years of the manuscripts are from 1995 to 2014, and the latest literature access was on
Feb, 2014. 3. GL classi fi cation scheme
The concept of GL can be well understood from different perspectives. For instance, from the logistics parties point of view, all logistics parties including suppliers, manufacturers, distribution centers and customers are involved in GL; from the standpoint of logistics fl ows, GL can be viewed as the combination of forward logistics and reverse logistics. The activities and operations in GL, associated with one or more parties, work collaboratively and cooperatively to construct an integrated CO model with one or more objectives to improve the performance of GL. 3.1. Green parties and the related forward and backward material fl ow
All the logistics parties, e.g. supplier, manufacturers, distribu-tion centers and customers, are involved in GL. The co-ordination of the logistics parties can be simply described as a closed loop, as in Fig. 3 , where the used products are collected from customers and further processed to re-enter the cycle.

In traditional logistics, suppliers, acting as the source of raw materials, components or semi-products, are at the very beginning of the logistics fl ows. However, in GL, in addition to the merely supply, suppliers also partially carry out the function of recycling materials from used products. Supplier integration ( Walton et al., 1998 ), supplier selection ( Zhen-Hua et al., 2010 ) and purchasing strategies ( Min and
Galle, 1997 ) are the activities of most concern that are related to green suppliers. Manufacturers are at the core of the traditional logistics, which receive raw materials from upstream and provide fi nished products downstream. Manufacturing activities, e.g. job-shop sequen-cing, fl ow-shop scheduling, etc. synthesize the operations of machines, resources and labor ( Alvarado-Iniesta et al., 2013; Prakash et al., 2008 ).
In addition, remanufacturing has become a requisite aspect of man-ufacturers as well ( Kumar et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2012 ). The integration of manufacturing and remanufacturing is also an promis-ing research area ( Kenn X  et al., 2012 ). Inventory management and customer handling are the other tw o aspects of green activities and operations involved with distribution centers and customers respec-tively. Inventory management covers not only the storage of products, but also inventory forecasting for the multi-echelon supply chain ( Noorul Haq and Kannan, 2006 ) and inventory routing problem with uncertain demand ( Huang and Lin, 2010 ). As for customer handling, apart from the customer satisfaction measurement of logistics services ( Kannan et al., 2009 ), the collection of used products or waste from customers is also an important area relating to customer handling ( Agarwal et al., 2012; Mazhar et al., 2007 ).

Different parties involved in the closed-loop supply chain have their own roles and objectives. GL is concerned with producing and distributing goods in a sustainable way, taking account of environmental and societal factors. Thus the objectives are not only concerned with the economic impact of logistics activities and operations, but also the wide effects on the environment and society, such as environmental pollution measurement, waste collection and customer satisfaction analysis ( Sbihi and Eglese, 2007 ). Different objectives associated with different CO models can be adopted as the criteria to measure the performance of GL. The objectives of GL models cover three aspects: economic, environmental and societal objectives, which are also known as the triple bottom line ( Dyllick and Hockerts, 2002; Elkington, 1998 ) and described in Fig. 4 . Each objective also has its own sub-criteria.

The introduction of RL, as a counterpart of traditional logistics, complements the integrity of GL ( Lee and Lam, 2012 ). The collection, examination and disposal of used products are the typical moves of reverse logistics as shown in Fig. 5 . Depending on the results of quality checking, the collected products can be directly reused by customers, repaired in distribution centers, remanufactured by manufacturers or recycled by suppliers to fully utilize the remaining value ( Fleischmann et al., 1997; Rogers and Tibben-Lembke, 2001 ). Another research direction of RL is the comparative study of forward logistics, either the separation from forward logistics or the integration with forward and backward logistics by considering the similarities and differences between them ( Marsillac, 2008 ). 3.2. Green activities and operations
The implementation of GL consists of various green activities and operations. In this research, after a comprehensive and extensive literature review, we propose a GL framework, as shown in Fig. 6 . Three categories exist under the GL, namely green performance measurement, green operations implementation and green strategies formulation. The green performance measurement can be based on the described objectives mentioned in Section 3.1 . The sub-dimensions of green operations are shown in Fig. 6 . 3.2.1. Network design
The category of network design can be understood as either a singular problem of harmonizing all logistics entities simulta-neously or a combination of a variety of sub-problems. The design of logistics networks are mostly processed as multi-echelon or multi-phase, differentiating the upstream, downstream and also reverse logistics, while models are normally proposed to solve the as multi-objective optimization problem. For example, Wang (2009) introduced a multi-echelon defective supply chain network design with a two-phase ant colony algorithm, and Pal et al. (2010) aggregated procurement, production and shipment planning for a three-echelon supply chain design. The performance analysis of existing logistics networks is the fundamental step for further improvement. Kannan et al. (2009) analyzed the logistics net-works from a closed loop perspective. Referring to the analysis of current logistics networks, the optimization operation can be in fl uenced by numerous factors. Kumar et al. (2009) tried to minimize the supply chain cost with embedded risk. Chen and Ju (2013) designed the supply chain network under various disruption scenarios. Che (2009) solved a balanced and defective supply chain problems considering WEEE/RoHS directives. Validi et al. (2013) even integrated a low-carbon distribution system into the design of product distribution logistics networks.

Differing from the integrated view of logistics network design, there are several independent dimensions within this category. The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is almost the very beginning of routing related problems, and is also a benchmark problem for testing the effectiveness and ef fi ciency of various approaches or techniques.
Dorigo and Gambardella (1997a) , Chong et al. (2010) and Shi et al. (2007) applied the ant colony algorithm, the bee colony algorithm and particle swarm optimization in TSP respectively. In addition to the general TSP, various TSP variants were also proposed, such as
Probabilistic TSP ( Branke and Guntsch, 2005 ) and Fuzzy TSP ( Sarhadi and Ghoseiri, 2010 ), with regard to new added constraints or features.
The vehicle routing problem (VRP), derived from TSP, is the core of current logistics practice, due to the fact that transportation accounts for the largest proportion of logis tics operations. Indeed, the number of VRP publications almost accounts for 50% of the category of network design based on the reviewed literature, which indicates the importance of this category for research and application. The importance of VRP can be categorized as one independent research area. Since the introduction of VRP, numerous VRP variants have been proposed considering the different conditions, application scenarios and practical needs. The top two variants are Capacitated VRP ( Mazzeo and Loiseau, 2004 ) and VRP with time windows ( Favaretto et al., 2007 ) taking into account the capacity of vehicle and customer requirements.
In reverse logistics, VRP with backhauls is an interesting research direction of great importance, whi ch synthesizes the operations of deliveryandpickupofusedproductssimultaneously( Gajpal and
Abad, 2009a ). More comprehensive and extensive reviews of VRP can be found in previous research ( Bochtis and S X rensen, 2010; Eksioglu et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2013; Toth and Vigo, 2002 ).
 of the network design category, for either determining the location of new facilities or in selecting pro per facilities from current extant ( Cabrera et al., 2012 ). Given that the relative location of manufac-turers and customers are fi xed, we need to select appropriate suppliers and distribution centers in order to meet the demand of production and consumption. Capacitated FLP is most practical variant of FLP with regard to the capacity of different facilities ( Chen and Ting, 2008 ). FLP is normally processed with another covering problem, in which not only the open/close status of a facility is determined, but also its served targets. Partner selection can also be regarded as a type of externalization of FLP, in which supplier selection and 3PL service provider selection are two typical exam-ples. In order to construct integrated Green Logistics, not only the core manufacturers need to  X  green  X  their process, but also the upstream sourcing, in which environmental factors in fl uence both the supplier selection and procurement strategies ( Zhen-Hua et al., 2010 ). 3PL service providers, even the 4PL, play important roles in the sophisticated logistics systems ( Efendigil et al., 2008 ). 3PL is a relatively independent entity, which can provide professional service to both customers and vendors. The performance of 3PL also affects the ef fi ciency of the whole logistics system; therefore, the selection of 3PL is crucial to the construction of logistics system ( Qu et al., 2011; Rajesh et al., 2011 ). 3.2.2. Product and inventory
In the traditional logistics operation, manufacturers play a core role against others, comprising two aspects, i.e. design and production. Alvarado-Iniesta et al. (2013) introduced an optimiza-tion mechanism of material fl ow in a manufacturing plant. Liu et al. (2013) tried to optimize process planning during production operations. Budinsk X  et al. (2012) also tried to optimize the scheduling process in a production system aiming to minimize production cost, overall production time and optimal utilization of the resources. Apart from the general production scheduling, job shop scheduling and fl ow shop scheduling are two representative examples of production scheduling, in which multiple objectives are regularly adopted; one consists of minimizing the make-span ( Rajendran and Ziegler, 2005 ), the total fl ow time, and the completion-time variance ( Gajpal and Rajendran, 2006 ), while the other focuses on the determination of the optimal job sequences ( Prakash et al., 2008 ). In recent logistics research, customers are paying more attention than ever before. Compared with standardized products, more and more customers like to purchase customized products based on their preferences, such as customized PCs and con fi gurable automobiles, which brings for-ward the concept of component production and assembly line planning ( Lv and Lu, 2010 ). Zhu and Zhang (2010) tried to solve a sequencing problem in a mixed model assembly line.

Inventory management and customer handling are the other two aspects of green activities and operations involved with distribution centers and customers respectively. Inventory management covers not only the storage of products, but also inventory forecasting. Apart from measuring customer satisfaction on l ogistics services, the collection of used products from customers is also important ( Agarwal et al., 2012;
Mazhar et al., 2007 ). The internal organization operations, such as inventory management of returned products, product layout for production and remanufacturing ( Bulut and Tasgetiren, 2013 ), demand forecasting and storage of incoming returned products ( Noorul Haq and Kannan, 2006 ) are the foundations of green logistics management.
Huang and Lin (2010) introduced a multi-item inventory routing problem with demand uncertainty. Gong et al. (2007) proposed an inventory facility location model for perishable food distribution.
Mahadevan et al. (2003) discussed the inventory policies regarding remanufacturing. More valuable research problems could be derived from the role of production and inventory management, no matter in traditional logistics or modern logistics. 3.2.3. Reverse logistics
Comparatively, reverse logistics is one of the important aspects of contemporary logistics, which concerns the fl ow of products from the point of consumption to the point of origin ( Zhang and
Guo, 2014 ). The movement in reverse logistics normally consists of collection, examination, pre-processing and fi nal disposal of used products, while the fi nal operation of used products can be direct reuse, repair, refurbish, recycle or land fi ll. Due to the unique features of reverse logistics, the comparison between reverse logistics and forward logistics, together with identifying the differences and similarities, always attract researchers' attention.
Reverse logistics can either be treated as an independent research fi eld or a complementary research aspect to forward logistics contributing to the construction of an integrated logistics network ( Marsillac, 2008 ). For instance, Ko and Evans (2007) introduced a dynamic integrated forward/reverse logistics network model con-sidering 3PLs. Easwaran and  X ster (2010) proposed a closed loop supply chain network design model with integrated forward and reverse channel decisions. Pishvaee et al. (2010) also raised a bi-objective integrated forward/reverse logistics network design model.
Apparently, the integration of rever se logistics with forward logistics is more popular than in studying reverse logistics alone.
The initial purposes of reverse lo gistics are to fully utilize the remaining value of used products an d avoid environmental pollution.
Apart from the raw materials from suppliers, the used products could be viewed as another source for material, which leads to integrated study of remanufacturing and reverse logistics. For example, Mutha and Pokharel (2009) introduced a strategic network design problem for reverse logistics and remanu facturing using both new and old product modules. Kenn X  et al. (2012) proposed a production planning model of a hybrid manufacturin g-remanufacturing system. Chen and
Liu (2013) also designed a hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing system using an uncertain programming model. Disassembly line sequencing in remanufacturing, and the counterpart of the role of assembly line planning in manufacturing, are the derived result of reverse logistics. The related study of disassembly line sequencing can be found in the literature ( Kalayci and Gupta, 2013b; Tripathi et al., 2009; Yeh, 2012b ).
 management is another important aspect. Waste management is a key process to protect the environment and conserve resources. The increasingly sophisticated reverse logistics networks also guarantee ef fi cient waste avoidance and waste reduction. Bautista and Pereira (2006) modeled the location problems of collection areas for urban waste management. Karadimas et al. (2008) tried to optimize the routing for urban solid waste transportation. Ye et al. (2011) proposed a location and set-covering model for waste resources recycling centers in Taiwan. 4. Classi fi cation of swarm intelligence Jing Wang in 1989 in the context of cellular robotic systems ( Beni and
Wang, 1993 ), while Bonabeau et al. (1999) rede fi ned it in 1999 as  X  any attempt to design algorithms or distributed problem-solving devices inspired by the collective behavior of social insect colonies and other animal societies  X  . Most of the SI approaches are inspired by the collective behavior of natural species, such as ants foraging, birds fl ocking and bees gathering honey. Nevertheless, the term swarm couldbeextendedtoanyconstrainedcollectionofinteractingagents or individuals. Some examples of SI are summarized in Table 2 .
Among the typical examples of SI, the most popular and successful SI algorithms (i.e. ACO, PSO and ABC) and their applications in GL are explained in the following sub-sections. 4.1. Ant colony optimization which was fi rstly introduced by Colorni et al. (1991) .Duringthe searching process for food source s, ants behave intelligently to the optimal path to food source, which is practically achieved by the utilization of pheromone. The existence of pheromone shows the trace of an ant, and provides heuristic information for other ants, which decide whether to follow this pheromone trace or not. If the new ant chooses to follow this pheromone trace, it would reinforce the density of pheromone; otherwise the pheromone would be gradually evaporated and fi nally exhausted. The above decision strategies can be regarded as positive feedback and negative feed-back respectively. Higher pheromone density indicates higher chosen probability. Therefore, more and more ants choose to follow the trace with high pheromone density and construct the optimal path to the food source. Since the introduction of the ACO algorithm, it has gained much popularity and diverse variants of ACO have also been proposed for adapting various CO problems, such as Ant System ( Dorigo et al., 1996 ), Ant Colony System ( Dorigo and Gambardella, 1997a )andMAX  X  MIN Ant System ( St X tzle and Hoos, 2000 ). More comprehensive descriptions of ant related algorithms can be found in the literature ( Cordon et al., 2002 ).

The whole procedure of the ACO algorithm can be illustrated as follows. Initially, ants are placed on the nodes of the graph randomly. Then each ant selects a connected and unvisited node as its next movement probabilistically. The probability is in enced two factors, the distance from the current node to the next node and the pheromone on the associated edge. This movement is executed iteratively until all ants have traversed all the nodes on the graph, which is called one cycle. After each cycle, the pheromone deployment of the whole graph is updated. The principle is that whenever an ant moves through an edge, the pheromone on that edge is reinforced; otherwise, it would evaporate and be exhausted. After a certain number of cycles, the path with highest pheromone density is found, which repre-sents the optimal solution.

The applications of ACO in green logistics are of great value as the intrinsic features of the ACO algorithm, fi nding the shortest route by ants, promote its popular application in vehicle routing problems. For example, Dorigo and Gambardella (1997a) fi rstly applied ant colonies to solve the standard TSP, while Bell and McMullen (2004) further adapted ACO techniques to handle the
VRP. Moreover, Moncayo-Mart X nez and Zhang (2011) adopted a multi-objective ant colony optimization approach to resolve the supply chain design problem.

Apart from the general adoption of ACO, researchers are also trying to improve the effectiveness and ef fi ciency of ACO through various means. Chen and Ting (2006) proposed an improved ant colony system (IACS) algorithm, possessing a new state transition rule, a new pheromone update rule and diverse local search approaches, to solve VRP. Agrawal and Tiwari (2007) introduced collaborative ant colony optimization (CACO) to resolve the sto-chastic mixed-model U-shaped disassembly line balancing and sequencing problem. The distinguishing feature of this proposed
CACO was that it maintained bilateral colonies of ants which independently identi fi ed the two disassembly sequences, but using the information obtained by their collaboration to guide to the future path. Gajpal and Abad (2009b) presented a multi-ant colony system (MACS) using a new construction rule as well as two multi-route local search schemes for VRP with backhauls. Yu et al. (2009) brought forward an improved ant colony optimization (IACO) including a new pheromone updating strategy, called ant-weight strategy, and a mutation operation.  X atay (2010) came up a saving-based ant algorithm by employing a new saving-based visibility function and pheromone updating procedure. Liu et al. (2012) improved the max  X  min ant system based on the strategy of sorting elite ants to tackle the disassembly sequence planning.
Another direction for the improvement of the ACO algorithm is the hybridization with other techniques. Other techniques could either provide good initial solutions as the input for ACO at the beginning, or perform the function of improving the middle candidate solutions. For instance, Chen and Ting (2008) combined the Lagrangian heuristic and the ant colony system to create a new hybrid algorithm, named LH-ACS, to handle the single source capacitated FLP. Lee et al. (2010) proposed an enhanced ant colony optimization (EACO), in which the simulated annealing (SA) provided initial solutions for ACO. Zhu and Zhang (2010) presented ant colony optimization with elitist ant (ACOEA) algorithm. Both tabu search (TS) and elitist strategy were adopted in this ACOEA to improve the performance of candidate solutions. Balseiro et al. (2011) hybridized ACO with an aggressive insertion heuristic to overcome the shortcoming of ACO in case of infeasible solutions in VRP. Wang (2013) presented an adaptive ant colony algorithm (AACA), coupled with a pareto local search algorithm, to overcome the premature convergence problem when applying ACO into VRP. 4.2. Particle swarm optimization
The PSO algorithm simulates the movement of a set of particles in search space under predetermined rules in order to fi nd the optimal position. PSO was originally proposed by Eberhart and Kennedy (1995) , being inspired by bird fl ocking, fi sh schooling, and even human social behavior. Reynolds (1987) proposed a bird-oid model to simulate the behavior of bird fl ocking. Therein each individual followed three simple rules: collision avoidance, velocity matching, and fl ock centering. Derived from the bird-oid model, in PSO, individuals representing solutions herein are treated as parti-cles, and each particle is characterized by its associated value, position vector and velocity vector. Apart from the three inner attributes, each particle also memorizes its historical best position (local best position) and global best position of the swarm, and refers to those two positions whenever it moves to the next position. During the iterative process of movement, all particles gradually converge at the global optimal position.

The procedure of the PSO algorithm can be described as in the following. At the beginning, a number of particles are randomly placed in the search space. Each particle holds its position and velocity information in a vector format. Whenever movement occurs, the particle needs to update its velocity information referring to three factors: its current velocity, the local best position and the global best position. Different weightings of different factors indicate different optimization strategies. Subse-quently, the particle updates its position information following the updated velocity vector. The positions of each particle correspond to candidate solutions. The local and global best positions are updated after each movement provided that the particle arrives at a better position. This procedure is conducted iteratively until the stopping criteria are met. The global best position is the optimal solution which can be found so far.

Wang and Liu (2010) proposed a chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) approach to handle the assembly line balan-cing problem, in which the chaos method was utilized to improve the solution quality and to increase the convergence rate. Kanthavel et al. (2012) developed nested particle swarm optimiza-tion, as the integration of two other mechanism, master particle swarm optimization (MPSO) and slave particle swarm optimiza-tion (SPSO), to tackle the VRP with simultaneously delivery and pickup. Shankar et al. (2012) introduced a hybrid multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to solve the bi-objective distribution scheduling, while Venkatesan and Kumanan (2012) employed another multi-objective discrete particle swarm algorithm (MODPSA), containing two different global guide selec-tion techniques, for supply chain network design.

Qi (2011) proposed an improved discrete particle swarm opti-mization (DPSO), in which an iterated local search (ILS) method was adopted to ensure the avoidance of the local minimum. Latha
Shankar et al. (2013) integrated a non-dominated sorting (NDS) procedure in a multi-objective hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOHPSO) to achieve bi-objective optimization of two con fl icting objectives. Validi et al. (2013) presented a design of an experiment (DoE) guided multiple-objective particle swarm opti-mization (MOPSO) optimizer, in which DoE was utilized to elim-inate the un-realistic set of feasible and optimal solution sets, while another popular multi-attribute decision-making approach, TOPSIS, was employed to evaluate the solutions through exhaustive analy-sis, e.g. prioritization, ranking and scenario analysis. 4.3. Arti fi cial bee colony The arti fi cial bee colony (ABC) algorithm was introduced by
Karaboga (2005) , which imitates the collective and collaborative forging behavior of a bee colony. When forging, different bees work collaboratively to explore and exploit food sources with rich nectar. The arti fi cial bee colony consists of three types of bees, scout bees, employed bees and onlooker bees, which play different roles in the exploration and exploitation of food sources. Food sources are regarded as the solutions of speci fi c problems, among which the ones with more nectar correspond to better solutions.
The whole procedure of the ABC algorithm can be described as follows. Scout bees are assigned to fi nd the initial food sources by carrying out a random search in the search space. After that, employed bees are sent out to exploit the discovered food sources, and each employed bee matches one food source. During the exploitation procedure, each employed bee also carries out a neighborhood search and tries to fi nd a better food source nearby.
If a better food source is found, the employed bee would abandon the previous food source and exploit th e better one. After the completion of all employed bees, they return to the hive and share their information on food sources with onlooker bees waiting in the hive through a waggle dance. The onloo ker bees would choose to follow certain employed bees and exploit corresponding food sources probabilistically. This probability is computed by the richness of the corresponding food sources. Once an onlooker bee chooses to follow an employed bee, it becomes an employed bee and repeats the procedure of employed bees. After certain number of iteration of the exploration and exploitation procedure, a food source may be exhausted and abandoned. In that case, the corresponding employed bee becomes a scout bee and randomly fi nds a new food source to replace the abandoned one. The whole procedure of ABC algorithm is described with four periods con fi rmed in the above description, (1) initialization phase, (2) employed bee phase, (3) onlooker bee phase and (4) scout bee phase.

To improve the performance of the ABC algorithm, various improvement and enhancement techniques are considered. Shi et al. (2012) tried to improve the global search capacity with the tournament selection strategy when solving VRP with time win-dows. Zhang and Guo (2014) adopted a greedy adjustment strategy in their proposed discrete arti fi cial bee colony algorithm.
Yao et al. (2013) attempted to incorporate multi-dimensional heuristic information and a local optimization, based on the scanning strategy, into the ABC. Zhang et al. (2013) devised a tree search algorithm, through analyzing the neighborhood property, to enhance the exploitation capability of ABC. Pandey and Kumar (2013) incorporated different types of real coded crossover opera-tors into ABC, aiming to improve the exploration property. Kumar et al. (2013) proposed a chaos-based interactive arti fi cial bee colony (CI-ABC) algorithm to resolve the remanufacturing opera-tion scheduling.

Cabrera et al. (2012) proposed a hybrid approach, combining the arti fi cial bee algorithm and mixed integer programming, for large-scale capacitated FLP. They mentioned that the hybrid implementation could help to bypass certain inherited weaknesses of each algorithm and be capable of fi nding an optimal solution in an acceptable computational time. Li and Yin (2012) introduced a discrete arti fi cial bee colony algorithm with composite mutation strategies (CDABC), which comprise the Nawaz  X  Enscore  X  Ham (NEH) heuristic for initialization, composite mutation strategies for population improvement and a fast local search property for enhancing the best individual. Liu and Liu (2013) presented a hybrid discrete arti fi cial bee colony (HDABC) algorithm, in which the initial population was generated from a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) based on the Nawaz  X  Enscore
Ham (NEH) heuristic and was further improved through discrete operators and algorithms. 5. Results discussion and implication fi rst with the prede fi ned schemes for both GL and SI. Practical implications and potential research opportunities can be derived from the results. After the results analysis, we provide a mapping scheme between problem types and swarm intelligent algorithms, which can help researchers to get an intuitive and intrinsic understanding of the problems and methods. The useful principles of selection, improvement, hybridization and even the customiza-tion of algorithms for speci fi c type of problems are also covered in the mapping scheme. 5.1. Integration of GL and SI scheme, the publications reviewed in this research are presented in Table 3 . From the result, we can see that among the three categories, network design accounts for more than 50% of the reviewed publications, and two main dimensions within this category are VRP and logistics network/system. For the other two categories, the distribution of review articles is rather even.
Such a result could indicate that the weighting of each category and dimension in the associated scope meets our initial specula-tion that routing and scheduling related problems contribute to the major proportion in GL. Almost all the routing or scheduling problems in practical situations are too complicated to be solved by exact approaches due to their non-uniform dispersed solution space. The varied constraints and diverse objectives lead to the popularity of meta-heuristic approaches. Among the three exem-plars of swarm intelligence, the application of ACO is much comprehensive than the other two, as the introduction of ACO was earlier than the others and the inherent features of ACO are more suitable for routing optimization problems.
 are more preferable and useful when solving combinatorial optimi-zation problems. However, the selection of the proper meta-heuristic approach for speci fi cproblemsisstilladif fi cult issue. To our knowledge, there still are no clear rules or guidance in handling this issue. The matching between prob lems and methods involves three aspects; the problem nature, the mathematical model formulation and the candidate of meta-heuristics, as illustrated in Fig. 7 .Practical problems have to be abstracted into mathematical models, consider-ing their speci fi c properties or features, in order to be further processed by meta-heuristics. In r eal scenarios, two more aspects that need to be considered are the solution quality and the computational cost. Due to the complexity feature of combinatorial optimization problems, almost no meta-heuristic can guarantee that fi nding the best solution using the shortest time. Thus, the balance between solution quality and com putational cost has to be consid-ered when choosing the meta-heuristic approach. The second aspect in fl uencing meta-heuristics selection is the mathematical model formulation. Single or multiple objectives; linear or non-linear constraints; discrete or continuous variables play a crucial role of algorithm selection and adaption. For example, the features of the decision variables could determine the encoding mechanism, and the constraints can be processed or avoided through updating strategies.
Table 4 lists the matching between the general problem, mathematical model and swarm intelligence. Different swarm intelligent algorithms, e.g. ACO, PSO, ABC and GA, use different schemes to represent the solutions to problems. For example, the candidate solutions are represented as the pheromone traces of ants and the positions of particles in ACO and PSO respectively. As for mathematical models, the swarm intelligent algorithms use similar principles to handle the objectives, constraints and variables. 5.2. Algorithms customization
Among all the previous SI algorithms, the search strategy, named  X  diversi fi cation VS intensi fi cation  X  is the most important core driving the changes of the search process. The term diversi-fi cation means the exploration of the search space, while the term intensi fi cation indicates the exploitation of the accumulated search experience ( Consoli and Darby-Dowman, 2007 ). In other words, diversi fi cation and intensi fi cation can be understood as the exploration of the whole search space (global search) and the exploitation of certain promising area (local search) respectively. For example, when the search process starts, it generates and computes a set of random individuals in the search domain in order to fi nd the promising areas (diversi fi cation). Then the algorithm needs to investigate the promising zones to fi nd the local optimum point (intensi fi cation). Nevertheless, the forces of diversi fi cation and intensi fi cation mutually interact. Even within one search step, some actions may behave as a diversi fi ed search, while others intensively search the current area. Finding a good balance between diversi fi cation and intensi fi cation is essential in order to quickly identify regions in the search space with high quality solutions, without wasting too much time in the region with low quality solutions.

In general, the population size can be treated as a straight-forward sign of diversi fi cation, while the number of iterations can be regarded as a symbol of intensi fi cation. Since a larger popula-tion means a more diversi fi ed search and more rounds of iteration suggest a more intensi fi ed search in one area. However, it does not means that the combination of larger population and more iteration can certainly lead to better solutions, as larger popula-tions may cause a low convergent speed and more iteration may result into trapping at a local optimum. The trade-off between diversi fi cation and intensi fi cation is due to the reciprocal of the various intrinsic components, which are named I&amp;D (intensi tion &amp; diversi fi cation) components, as any algorithmic or func-tional component (operators, actions, strategies, etc.) that has a diversi fi cation and/or intensi fi cation effect on the search process.
Therefore, a uni fi ed view named I&amp;D frame on critical inherent components of different algorithms shown in Fig. 8 may be helpful to underline the similarities and differences between them and provide practical insights for the hybridization of diverse algo-rithms ( Blum and Roli, 2003 ).

OG (objective guide) means that the I&amp;D components are solely guided by the objective function, NOG (non-objective guide) means the I&amp;D components are solely guided by one or more functions other than the objective function, and R (randomness) means the I&amp;D components are solely guided by randomness. For example, the selective strategy, i.e. roulette wheel selection, exempli fi es the effect of OG in terms of the fi tness value of the solutions. The corner OG corresponds to I&amp;D components with a maximum intensi fi cation effect and a minimum diversi fi effect. On the other hand, corners NOG, R and the segment between the two corners correspond to I&amp;D components with a maximum diversi fi cation effect and a minimum intensi fi effect. All I&amp;D components can be located somewhere on or in between the three corners. In step with the OG gradient, the less an I&amp;D component uses the objective function, the further away from corner OG it has to be located. The same explanation applies to the gradient of NOG and R.
 the basic I&amp;D components that are inherent to the above SI algorithms. For example, the pheromone update component in
ACO has the effect of changing the probability distribution that is used to sample the search space. It is guided by the objective function (solution components found in better solutions than others are updated with a higher amount of pheromone) and it is also in fl uenced by a function applying pheromone evaporation.
From this perspective, this component is located on the line between corners OG and NOG. Provided that the evaporation function is relatively fi xed, this component should be closer to the corner OG. In other words, the effect of this mechanism is basically the intensi fi cation of the search, but there is also a diversifying component that depends on the greediness of the pheromone update (the less greedy or deterministic, the higher is the diversifying effect). In some ACO variants, the evaporation function may even be dynamic, which leads to the dynamic trade-off between the effect of intensi fi cation and diversi fi ring to the Section 4 , the I&amp;D components and their intrinsic force are summarized in the Table 5 .
 there are also some other ways to control and balance the performance of the algorithms. One is the adaptive parameter adjustment. In PSO, the velocity updating is determined by three factors; inertia, local best position and global best position, with different weightings for each factor. The relative weightings of different factors could affect the performance of the algorithm.
Adaptive parameter adjustment can help to identifying promising areas quickly at the beginning, and search the selected area ef fi ciently with the change of parameters. Another control strategy is the restart mechanism in case one solution is discarded. Almost all the meta-heuristic algorithms use iterative search procedures, so the restart mechanism after one certain iteration can also in fl uence the following performance. The abandonment operation in ABC is a typical example. After one food source has been abandoned, the scout bee needs to fi nd a replaced food source.
The new food source may be found randomly, or follow certain mechanisms to avoid historically used food sources with bad performance. The utilization of historical information is the foundation of the restart mechanism. Finally the hybridization of two or more meta-heuristic algorithms or the integration of meta-heuristics with other optimization techniques is also a promising research area, which aims to compensate for the possible weak-ness of each algorithm and make use of their advantages. 6. Conclusions and further work
Because of the deterioration of environment and the consump-tion of the fi nite and diminishing energy sources, green logistics is gaining increasing attention substantially. Economic performance is no longer the only objective in logistics; two other aspects, environmental and societal performance, are becoming more important than ever before for the purpose of sustainable devel-opment. The operational level activities in logistics are the funda-mental for any upper management strategies, thus the modeling and implementing of green activities are of great importance. In this research, the green activities are classi fi ed into different dimensions and categories considering their inherent features.
Swarm intelligent algorithms of meta-heuristics are adopted to handle the abstracted mathematical models of green activities.
The literature review reveals the integration of green logistics and swarm intelligence. Moreover, an innovative and universal gui-dance is provided for the implementation of swarm intelligent algorithms when solving green logistics problems.

The contribution of this research can be described by the following aspects. First, a comprehensive and extensive literature review regarding the integration of green logistics and swarm intelligence is provided, which can help to understand the current research status in both areas and enrich the knowledge base of this interdisciplinary study. The classi fi cation scheme of operational-level activities in green logistics provides an intuitive description that helps to identify potentially fruitful research areas. Some green logistics categories have been accumulated a number of experienced studies, which others are still at the starting stage. Readers could identify their interested areas refer-ring to the results of this literature review. Apart from the green logistics, this research also presents a straightforward description of the application of swarm intelligent algorithms. For instance, the ACO algorithm accounts for more 50% comparing with the other two swam intelligence technqiues, which may attribute to the historical accumulation and its intrinsic features. Referring to the applications of these three typical examples, more swarm intelligent algorithms could be further adapted. In addition, con-sidering the various swarm intelligent algorithms and their variants, we analyzed their inner driving force for progression from a balancing perspective, through fully investigating their intrinsic features. The diversi fi cation and intensi fi cation effect of each operator in swarm intelligence algorithms are considered. It leads to another potential contribution which is algorithm custo-mization for the speci fi c problems.

Due to the predetermined conditions of literature collection, there may be other useful resources which are not covered in this research. Only the operational-level activities in green logistics are considered in this paper, however the application of swarm intelligence in the strategic or tactical level management of green logistics could be another research direction. In the proposed algorithm framework, only a limited number of swarm intelligent algorithms are analyzed, the other meta-heuristic algorithms, e.g. tabu search, simulated annealing, etc. may also be analyzed following the same procedure, and could contribute to a more comprehensive algorithm framework.
