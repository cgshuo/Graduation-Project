 The Environmental Sciences Division within Queensland Environmental Pro-tection Agency works to monitor, assess and model the condition of the envi-ronment. The Division has as a legislative responsibility to produce a whole-of-government report every four years dealing environmental conditions and trends in a  X  X tate of the Environment report X  (SoE)[1][2][3]. State of Environment Web Service Reporting System is a supplementary web service based SoE re-porting tool, which aims to deliver accurate, timely and accessible information on the condition of the environment through web services via Internet[4][5]. This prototype provides a scientific assessment of environmental conditions for a set of environmental indicators . It contains text descripti ons and tables, charts and maps with spatiotemporal dimensions to show the impact of certain environmen-tal indicators on our environment. This prototype is a template based indicator system, to which the administrator may add new sql queries for new indicator services without changing the architecture and codes of this template. The bene-fits are brought through a service-oriented architecture which provides an online query service with seamless integratio n. In addition, since it uses web service architecture, each individual component within the application can be imple-mented by using different programming languages and in different operating systems. Although the services showed in this demo are built upon two datasets of regional ecosystem and protection are a of Queensland, it will be possible to report on the condition of water, air, land, coastal zones, energy resources, biodi-versity, human settlements and natural culture heritage on the fly as well. Figure 1 shows the architecture of the prototype. In the next section, I will discuss the research tasks in the prototype.

The proto type provides a template which makes the administration work much easier. We also optimize the use of environmental data in the EPA in creating greater efficiencies in environmental reporting, and to move towards self-service, customized on-line environmental reporting based on a common and verifiable information base that can be routinely updated.
