Result Presentation. A straightforward presentation strategy is to present the recommended songs to users in a sorted list, which ranks the songs in a descending order of relevance scores estimated by the recommendation model. A problem of this strategy is that similar playlists will be recommended to a user for a particular venue within a short time period. As a result, users may feel boring about the rec-ommended playlists. To improve the user experience, Just-for-Me provides an interactive strategy to generate diverse playlists for a venue. Specifically, the artists of the top rec-ommended songs are presented to the users in an undirected graph (connected based on the similarities between artists). The community (based on similarity), genre and popular-ity of each artist are shown to the user. Users can select the artists they prefer in the moment based on artists X  sim-ilarities, genres and popularities. The songs of the selected artists are then sorted and presented to the users. This strategy can greatly increase the diversity of recommended playlists and better satisfy users X  local music needs, because the users themselves select the artists and these artists X  songs are very probably suitable for the current venue.

Music Annotation. Just-for-Me implicitly records users X  listening logs, including whether a song is skipped , how many times of a song and the duration of a song is played in each time in a particular place. The system also enables users to explicitly label the songs they like at certain venues. To facilitating the labeling process, three modes are designed to generate the candidate songs: (1) songs of certain artists, (2) the most popular songs in current, and (3) the recom-mended songs for a venue based on the numbers of users who like the songs at the venue. For the new users without any records, the three modes are also used to present the initial recommended results for them. This research study is partially supported by the Microsoft Research grant: My Mobile Music: Towards Cloud based Intelligent Music Recommendation on the Move.
