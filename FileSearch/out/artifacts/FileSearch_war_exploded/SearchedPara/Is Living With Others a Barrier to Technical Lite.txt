 Prior research describes how households coordinate to resolve technology complexity in residential settings. In this paper, we examine how social roles and routines of use can potentially hinder the development of tech nological literacy. Through this short paper, we aim to open a discussion about ways to increase technological litera cy of the public. H5.m. Information in terfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI): Miscellaneous. Design, Human Factors domestic computing; sociotechnical systems; technical literacy Domestic computing usage, digital housekeeping, device installation, and other forms of technical support in homes offer a variety of coordination challenges [1 , 2, 4, 5, 7-10, 13-16, 18, 19]. Prior work suggests that people may rely on others within and across households for technical help , even though the providers of this help may find it a burdensome experience. This state of affairs leads to an important question, particularly as complex, interconnected technologies become pa rt of the fabric of everyday life. How X  X nd how much X  X hould technological literacy and willingness to participate in technology selection, use, and maintenance practices be encouraged? In this short paper, we elaborate on this question via a case study of two families integrating information technologies into their homes as part of a larger research study. The differences between these families point to the importance of considering existing social norms, routines of use, and impact of life events on how technology is used and maintained in the home. Overall, their experiences in the study expose some of the  X  X icked proble ms X  with technological help at home, and increasing technologi cal literacy of the public. The data discussed in this paper is part of a larger study of technology-related practices in North American homes [12]. As part of this study, ten households set up, configured, used, and helped their family and friends with learning more about common home electronics and information technologies that prior studies have shown to be problematic. Th ey also installed and used a piece of custom software fo r collaborating and managing knowledge about their home co mputing environments. We collected data via group and individual interviews, questionnaires, software logs, and written responses in log books. Households participated in a gro up interview and home tour at the beginning of the study. At the conclusion of this session, the household was provided a set of t echnology-related activities to complete over the week. Each week, the research team visited the home, conducted a short check-i n interview, collected logbooks, and provided a new set of activities. At the conclusion of the study, the household members co mpleted a questionnaire, were interviewed as a group, and were interviewed individually. Across all ten homes, we collected 35 transcribed interviews, 191 photographs, and copious field notes written after each home visit. Qualitative data were analyzed using affinity diagramming; these findings were triangulated against survey and software log data collected from each home. In this paper, we restrict our discussion to two families participating in the study, as they provide particularly salient insight into the challenges of household norms and computational literacy. Steve and Janine are a couple in their mid-30s living in a suburb of a large North American city. Steve is a manager for an engineering firm, and Janine is a former teacher who now stays at home with their two children, a 4.5-year-old girl (Allie) and a 1.5-year-old boy (Billy). The home is connected to the Internet using cable Internet, and the householde rs exclusively use wireless connectivity for all of their co mputers. The family has two computers in the home, both mobile. Janine and Steve share a small notebook computer, which is used throughout the house. Janine uses it for all tasks, except when she needs to print. When she prints, she puts items on a flas h drive and then uses the second computer in the home. This se cond computer, although a mobile device, is permanently located in a spare bedroom. This room also is home to a printer and an external hard drive that holds all of their pictures and music. Steve uses this computer for homework associated with his part-time MBA program, and the couple X  X  daughter, Allie (4.5 years old) uses this machine to play children X  X  video games online. The family has a digital camera, one flat screen TV in the living room, and a CRT TV in the children X  X  playroom. Why did the members of the household acquire these technologies? The couple X  X  attitude toward purchasing technology purchases. Everything has a purpose, and items that break are repaired such that they are usable and their flaws are hidden; for instance, the netbook was purchased after their original laptop fell on the floor, shearing in half. To continue to have a mobile device, they purchased a new mobile computer. Steve, with the help of his technically skilled younger br other, repurposed the broken machine so that it would function as a  X  X esktop X  computer for the family to use. A point of contention in the home with respect to appropriation of technology involves audiovisual and gaming equipment. Steve used to be an avid video gamer and AV enthusiast, but largely gave those hobbies up once he had ch ildren; his  X  X icer X  (but more  X  X gly X ) speakers are hidden away in the children X  X  playroom, and his video game consoles were gi ven away to his sister. When it comes to buying new technology, Steve notes that his practices changed after having children. He notes that: Janine considers herself to be a person who if she X  X   X  X onfident in how to do it then I X  X l do it myself. X  She has tackled plenty of home repairs on her own, including removing wallpaper and wiring light switches and plugs (her father, an electrician, taught her over the phone how to wire them). But co mputers are different. Janine says: What X  X  meaningful here is that technology enters the home only for a specific purpose. We also see a coping strategy of willful ignorance X  intentionally avoiding thinking about or examining new technologies X  X s they are not practical give n one X  X  current lifestyle. Rather than buying anything and everything, technology choices are much more calculated, much more by necessity. Janine does not call professional t ech support services because, as she states X   X  X  have people in my family who are my tech support. X  Her first resource for getting assi stance with technology problems is Steve, because he is the most readily available to help. Her second choice is Steve X  X  younger br other, Phil, who lives nearby and holds the reputation of bei ng the  X  X echnical geek X  of the family. Steve and Janine will ask for technical help such as removing computer viruses in retu rn for providing a meal or beer. Janine describes their relationship as  X  X e X  X  like our Geek Squad to fix our computer...I have to feed him dinner. X  Steve says that Phil  X  X omplains about it, but he fixes whatever it is. X  Janine also gets help from her father, an electrician living in another state. Janine describes her dad as  X  X ot so much the virus kind of, cleaning it off the computer guy. He X  X  the behind the scenes wiring guy. X  Her father helped them rewire the cable jacks in their home. Janine says she has a  X  X addy-do X  list when her father visits for fixing things (technology related and otherwise). Says Steve,  X  X he puts things on my list, and they don X  X  get done, so it gets transferred to his list. X  Despite relying heavily on others for technical assistance, Janine is well aware of the burden she places on her helpers. In the final visit at her home, she said: She mentions that there are many occasions where she could ask for help, but chooses not to, becaus e she does not want to  X  X other X  her helpers. In summary, Janine, wh ile not afraid to take on other sorts of technical tasks, such as rewiring electric systems in a home, does not have this attitude when it comes to computers. Although she will help her daughter and mother-in-law with very basic problems, for the most part , she is not enthusiastic about computers, nor does she want to learn more about them, or in some cases, go out of her way to ask for assistance when needed. Since Janine has a strong commitment to purchasing and using technology only as necessary, so there are few instances to learn about new technologies. She also has a strong support structure. If technology is confusing or ma lfunctioning, her husband, brother-in-law, and father are all available for assistance. Although this For most of her life, she has never had much opportunity to struggle with technology and realize that what she thinks are mountains of technological difficult y are merely tiny bumps in the road. Left to her own devices, Janine is not going to want to become more effective or confident with technology. However, Steve noted that being in the study , in a situation in which their normal routines were disrupted, was ultimately positive for her, because it showed her that performing some technology-related tasks were not as difficult as she initially perceived them to be. Household 2, also located in a s uburb of the same North American city, was occupied by Viola, a mother in her 50s, and her three teenage girls: Keisha, Kassandra, and Karina. Viola is mildly interested in learning more about information  X  X ntimidated X  by technology. Of the children, Karina and Keisha have their own laptops. Kassandra, the youngest, primarily uses an iPod touch and laptops owned by others in the house. Keisha and Kassandra enjoy using and learni ng about technology, but the oldest daughter, Karina, is largel y uninterested in technology. She has a laptop for her college classes but describes herself as having little skill or interest in information technology. At first glance, the second household is technologically si milar to the first. They, too, have a limited amount of tech nology X  X ust enough to listen to music, browse the Internet, have the kids do homework, store photos, and print documents. The home is connect ed by cable Internet, and the family exclusiv ely uses wireless connectivity. The family has a television and a stereo system, too, but nothing complicated. At the outset, the technologies in these homes are mostly interchangeable. Yet there is a distinct difference between these families: in household two, the family had experienced a divorce. Recent research in CSCW has focused on the impact of life disruptions on ICT use, particularly with respect to such as deaths in the family, domestic violence, unemployment, and homelessness [6, 11]. When the structure of a family changes, technology maintenance practices and resources for advice may change, too. Statistics on marria ge and cohabitation show that nearly at least a quarter of all marriages in the United States end in divorce within five years; couples in second (or later) marriages, minority couples, as well as un married cohabitating couples are even more likely to split up [3]. When these relationships sour, it can affect technical support pract ices in the home. Given the frequency at which relationships di ssolve, these situations may be considered X  X n the long term X  X o be both normal and worthy of consideration. Viola, prior to her divorce, relied on her electrical engineer husband, Victor, to perform computer and electronics support. Because Victor was always available to fix problems, whether mechanical or electronic, she never had to think about these issues. When the couple divorced, however, support practices within the home shifted. Viola and her daughters had to take on the technical work that Victor had previously provided. For instance, Viola described during how she had to learn how to install speaker cable wiring on her own, because she did not have anyone else to do it. Although she had never performed the task before, and thought it was intimidating, once she actually tried it, she remarked that it was much easier than she had perceived it to be. Her daughter, Keisha (18), took on responsibility for setting up and maintaining the wireless computing infrastructures after the divorce. Keisha was the most logical choice for this role and fell into it; when the couple was marr ied, Keisha would follow Victor around while he was fixing things (electronics or otherwise). When she shadowed him, she woul d ask questions about what he was doing, and sometimes participate in the tasks as well. Thus she was the most prepared to take on these tasks once he was no longer in the home. Notably, howe ver, is that after the divorce, Victor still served as a technical reference to the daughters. The girls would phone him for technical advice. Keisha remarked that for some of the post-divorce maintenance tasks she did, her father would coach her over the phone of how to do them. More recently, he also helped her select a new laptop for college. Viola, however, excluded herself from this resource. Her daughters served as a conduit to the father X  X  advice, but she would not ask him for help directly. What statistics about family structur e, as well as the experience of these homes suggest, is that wh en thinking about how to support families engaging in technical support, it is important to think about resistance to engaging in learning about technology unless there is a transition to a situation in which a help-provider is no longer available for whatever reason. Although events such as divorce are ultimately negative experiences, shifts in family structures may present opportunitie s for householders to become more confident in engaging with technical infrastructures, as they may be forced to be in situations in which they have no choice other than to learn and become proficient. These situations may also create indirect channels th rough which technical information can flow. What, then, can this vignette tell us about helping Janine? Even though she does not want to become a techni cal expert, Janine worries about being a burden to those around her when it comes to technology help. After all, help seeking is an act that requires some amount of vulnerability. Asking for help can be upsetting, uncomfortable, or embarrassing to an individual. When one asks for help, he or she potentially ri sks rejection or negative judgment by others; psychology literature on helping suggests that  X  X othing makes you feel worse than making a fool of yourself in front of others X  [17]. Moreover, Janine thinks she has nothing to offer when it comes to technological a dvice, to even out the give-and-take of asking for help. Perhaps if she could become aware of having an audience X  X nd get feedback that her audience finds her experiences and advice worthw hile X  X hat may be a positive experience that could raise her confidence in her technical abilities. For instance, if Ja nine could see what others do not know, or that people are in fact taking what she has to say seriously, could that be empowerin g? Or would she be just as likely to hang onto the identity of being a  X  X echnically challenged X  person? Ultimately, a thorny question remains. Is Janine X  X  technological discomfort, and limited computer lit eracy a problem to be solved? Should we so boldly suggest that her family experience a traumatic disruption in order to improve her technological prowess? Or do we accept the status quo? And hence, we leave an exercise for the reader: what is the minimum level of technological literacy needed for life in the 21 st century? We thank our study participants fo r their time, effort, and honesty.
