 1. Introduction
Persons with severe mental illness, and most particularly those with schizophrenia and schizo-affective disorder, are at increased risk, as compared to the general population, to commit violent crimes [1]. This is a robust finding. It has been re-ported by several independent research groups working in industrialized [2 X 6] and underdeveloped countries [7] with dis-tinct cultures, health, social service and criminal justice systems, who have examined different cohorts and samples using various experimental designs including prospective, longitudinal investigations on birth cohorts [2,3,5] and population co-horts [6], follow-up studies comparing patients and their neighbours [8], random samples of incarcerated offenders [9], and complete cohorts of homicide offenders [10,11] . The results using official criminal records of convictions for violent crimes [3] and self and collateral reports of aggressive behaviour [4] concur in observing an increased prevalence of violent crimes among people with schizophrenia.

Violent crimes by persons with severe mental illness pose a significant human and financial burden on society, and especially on the health and criminal justice systems. If the factors associated with this violence could be identified, management and treatment programmes could be established to prevent the violent behaviour. A number of different strategies and instruments have been developed in an effort to assess the risk of violent behaviour among persons with severe mental illness [12 X 15] . Most are based on a wealth of research showing that both historical and current factors play a role. Historical factors that have been associated with violent behaviour by persons with severe mental illness include antisocial behaviour, criminal offending, and substance misuse among parents, conduct problems in childhood and early adolescence, substance misuse in adolescence, and aggressive behaviour towards others or violent crime. Clin-ical factors that have been linked to violent behaviour in this population include symptoms of psychosis, depression, and non-compliance with medication. Other current factors include substance misuse and inadequate community care [16,17] .

However, predicting the likelihood of violent behaviour by persons with severe mental illness has proven very difficult. At the best, previous predictions have produced area under ROC curve (AUC,  X ) estimates below 0.89 for learning and 0.71 for test sets in selected subgroups or 0.96 for complete datasets [18] and 0.80 for a stratum including only mentally ill subjects [19]. Unlike previous studies, the present study tackled this specific prediction problem using Bayesian statistics and in-cluded the use of informative priors and a new type of data triangulation process in the model construction. In addition, de-sign was uncommon for psychiatric domain  X  independent datasets were used for model learning and tests. However, the use of the Bayesian approach in psychiatric research is not new. In 1963, Overall [20] reported modelling for 13 different types of psychotic symptoms. The Bayesian approach has lead to findings related to aetiology as well as patient X  X  treatment and diagnosis setting [21 X 25] .

The present study aimed at identifying risk and protective factors associated with admission to a forensic psychiatric hos-pital and to create a robust merger model.

Unlike in the most of previous studies of violent crimes among people with severe mental illness, the modelling carried out here was based on a multinational data, and both Bayesian and frequentist (logistic regression) methods were used and compared. 2. Methods
We have previously shown that the forensic patients recruited in the different countries were very similar on clinical measures and on indicators of childhood problems and family characteristics [26]. We have not identified any major differ-ences in environmental factors or treatment practices across countries that were associated with forensic admission. Only minor differences were identified. For example, there was more use of illicit drugs in some countries than in others. 2.1. Design
Forensic hospitals were identified in four countries that were responsible for large catchment areas, in which almost all, if not all, persons with severe mental illness who were accused of a crime underwent a pre-trial psychiatric assessment, and if it was judged that they had committed a crime, they were sent to the forensic hospital. The sites were Southern British
Columbia in Canada (here forth Canada), Finland, the state of Hessen in Germany (here forth Germany), and Southern Swe-den (here forth Sweden). In these sites, a person with severe mental illness is admitted to a forensic hospital after commit-ting a serious violent crime and after his mental status has been assessed. Among subjects with mental illness, being admitted to a forensic psychiatric hospital is thus a proxy for having committed a violent offence.

In all study sites, there is a national, universally accessible, health system. Within each site, the forensic sample included consecutive discharges with a diagnosis of a major mental disorder. The control group included patients with severe mental illness being discharged from general psychiatric hospitals within the same geographic regions as the forensic hospitals. The patients were intensively assessed in the two weeks preceding discharge by experienced forensic psychiatrists who were trained to use standardized and validated diagnostic and symptom protocols and followed for two years, with interviews at six-month intervals. 2.2. Participants
Patients in the forensic hospitals with diagnoses of severe mental illness who were scheduled for discharge were invited to participate in the study. After complete description of the study to the patients, written informed consent was obtained. A diagnostic interview was then completed. If the diagnosis of severe mental illness was confirmed, the participant was in-cluded in the study and the other interviews and assessments were completed and information was collected from files.
At study entry, participants were asked for permission to contact their mothers or an older sibling in order to collect infor-mation about them as children and about other family members. If the participant agreed, the collateral was invited to par-ticipate. The same procedure was followed with the patients recruited in the general hospitals.

Almost all (95.8%) the patients were male with schizophrenia diagnosis (68.2%). 186 (60.4%) of the patients were re-cruited from the forensic hospitals and 122 from general hospitals. Of the 308 patients, 78 were recruited in Finland, 31 in Sweden, 79 in Germany, and 120 in Canada, between 1998 and 2000 [26,27] (cf. Table 1 ). Within each country, the study was approved by the appropriate ethical committee. 2.3. Analyses
In Bayesian analysis, the typical idea is to take advantage of existing information as a priori probability. Using Bayesian theorem, a priori can be combined with likelihood in order to produce a posterior probability. This study, however, assumed a different objective view for psychiatric domain  X  the priors were derived from actual observations in a model, not from beliefs or prior studies. We saw that the elements related to psychiatric patient X  X  background may contribute to subject X  X  tendency of forensic admission. This study contributed to understanding the aggregate outcome of societal, mental and so-matic protective and risk factors: do forensic or general patients differ regarding to known background path? 2.3.1. Classification
Our aim was a classification task in which members in given datasets were classified into two groups based on the pre-admission properties. Here, the key task was the prediction of an event before its possible occurrence: the predicted event nosis and distinguishes it from diagnosis. Prognosis can be defined as the prediction of the future course and outcome of disease processes, which may either concern their natural course or their outcome after treatment [28]. The main reason for doing a classification task  X  and not a regression task  X  was that the data set included hundreds of potential predictors and the outcome of interest and most of the predictors were dichotomous.

Firstly, we searched the country-specific factors among the factors presented in Table 1 . This was done to find robust country-independent predictors and, by doing this, substitution method could be used in testing (i.e., independent test sets).
In these non-informative country-specific models, no informative prior values were used. The prior probabilities for class the marginal probabilities, where k is the number of potential values for the predictor variable.

Raw  X  X  X s was observed X  data was mainly used in these classifications. Interaction terms were included only for the most be very hard to understand from the clinical perspective, they cannot be directly observed, they are sometimes artificial and/ or arbitrary, and the dataset included an extensive amount of predictors (i.e., deriving interactions would have been time costly and the potential gains would have been hypothetical). However, some composite variables (i.e., plausible variables merged from two or more variables) were also included.

For the very first time, the aim in this study was to find robust predictors and to generalize them to different country-specific sets. Country-independent predictions which would also be plausible were seen as more an important motive than mere predictive performance (i.e., the predictors can always get better and better, but generalized predictors and plausible explanations for them are more interesting in this domain). Thus, secondly, to produce generalized results, we used only the most influential predictors (most common factors with at least three hits out of four in our four country-specific models) found using the greedy hill-descending algorithm and assessed their impact using the regular NBC classifying.
Thirdly, based on the data triangulation of both the qualitative assessment of model robustness and the quantitative assessment of parameter candidates, we entered the Finnish data into this empty qualitative model with the found predic-tors and observed outcomes and probabilities to establish the likelihoods for fusion (cf. RPV from Chapter 3.1 for more de-tailed description). We then utilized a type of Naive Bayesian Fusion (NBF) and combined priors and related weights from the German country specific model to the Finnish likelihood model in order to obtain a merger model.

In the fusion, we used the German prior probabilities (direct probabilities) and German prior weights (i.e., number of observations in the particular predictor conditional to class variable) obtained from the country specific model, and gathered the marginal probabilities for the fusion using the reversed version of German model (cf. Table 4 for details related to the probabilities used). Unlike in previous studies, we also weighted the marginal probabilities with an evidence ratio (i.e., the relative accuracy between the German and Finnish country-specific models). Equal credibility ( X  X  X egree of belief X , here one example in the German set matched one example in the Finnish set) for both datasets was assumed because (as will be seen) the number of observations in both sets was relatively similar; both seemed to follow the whole data X  X  profile and their RPV was quite similar. In simple terms, we used Finnish model as likelihood, German model as priors and merged them to a gen-eralized model structure (i.e., a merger model was done by combining the Finnish and German data). Lastly, thorough testing was done.

The merger model was formed with a Naive Bayes classifier (NBC, P-Course [29 X 31] was initiated by the need of valid and relatively easy-to-use classification tool for the medical domain. Method X  X  most impor-iable, and its ability to utilize empirical prior information (i.e., reverse or direct probabilities and weights) in the model construction.

The algorithm has been found to be well-operating in the following tasks: variable selection (i.e., teaching is quite easy) is efficient in exploratory missions and, thus, the predictive performance tends to be good in exploratory analyses. In addition,
NBC is known to perform well when variables are independent, to have a low level of bias, and to score well on measures of discrimination but not on calibration. Another possible methods for this type of prediction task include for example logistic regression (LR, typically with, e.g., stepwise variable selection or Bayesian model averaging, BMA [32,33] ), and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis [34]. For information regarding P-Course, see sources utilizing this NBC [29 X 31,35 X 37] .
In this study, the country-specific models built with P-Course without the priors were compared to confirmatory LR mod-el X  X  accuracy without priors. This was done to ensure the predictive performance of NBC and robustness of findings also in this confirmatory setting, because NBC has presented its variable selection and prediction performance in exploratory mis-sions [29,31] . Thus, LRs were thought with the same predictors. This is a fair game  X  when doing this, the result for LR is independent of the program used (i.e., the performance of search algorithm does not affect the results).

In addition, LR with commonly used stepwise variable selection method was used to reflect the variable selection perfor-mance of NBC and LR. Stata 10 IC statistical software 2 was used in LR modelling. 2.3.2. Measures
We assessed the relations between class variable and predictors with posterior odds (PO), which equal the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. The POs were in which P PC presents the predicted class and P NPC the non-predicted class. POs are not directly dependent on data size and give an idea of the predictor X  X  strength.

The inner validity (precision, also complement to the accuracy; error rate) of the model refers to the capability to predict precision and reliability, and we wanted to search a model which has acceptable performance in both of them. We assessed these with the substitution method: naturally independent datasets were utilized for the learning and testing of model. We considered substitution with independent data set a more conservative and real life orientated method compared to simple portioning, in which the dataset is divided into independent learning and test sets that are eventually dependent.
The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was also used. For a dataset with N examples, N experiments were performed and for each experiment, N 1 examples were used for learning and the remaining 1 example for testing (i.e., the test exam-ple is labelled by an NBC classifier trained on all other learning examples). The mean error  X  probability (i.e., the lower level of CrI does not fall below 0 and the higher level of CrI does not exceed 1).
Analyzed complementary outcomes are also important in terms of specificity ( spe , predicted general examples of all ob-positive rate). However, these do not validly represent models X  performance as single measurements. Thus, we utilized the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) [39,40] estimated as the odds of positive general prediction results among the general patient population. The 95% CIs for the DORs can be esti-mated conventionally from with the antiln back-transformation [40]. The standard error ( se ) for lnDOR is forensic patient) will have less of an estimated probability of belonging to the positive class (forensic patient) than a ran-domly chosen positive case [42]. b A s can be estimated straightforwardly for learning sets.

However,  X  X  X rue X  probabilities for examples in test sets are unknown. Thus, in ability as the correct prediction, if it was the observed class [42,43] following a simple method: where n 0 is the number of positive cases and n 1 is the number of negative cases, and r the ranked list. The standard error ( se ) [42] for AUC was estimated as
In addition, the Stata 10 IC software was used to estimate accurate ments ( Gini compares the Lorenz curve of a ranked empirical distribution with the diagonal) [43];
When compared to simple accuracy, b A and Gini can produce different signals as they depend on the ranking of the observations.

Lastly, logarithmic loss function (log score) is a way of presenting losses from actual outcomes in prediction tasks [44]: which reaches minimum only when true probabilities are predicted. Log score also penalizes the inability to produce faithful probabilities. 3. Results 60.4% ( n = 186) of the subjects were forensic patients (mean age 40.8 years; 96.8% males) and 39.6% ( n = 122) were gen-eral psychiatric patients (mean age 37.0 years; 94.3% males). The greedy NBC algorithm identified seven common factors from the four national datasets: Violent crime prior to the crime that leads to admission to the forensic hospital, biological father with substance misuse, biological father with criminal convictions, male gender, presence of half-brothers, no use of psychotropics before age 18, and sexual abuse before age 18.

Following variables were present in all explorations using the independent country-specific data sets: Violent crime prior to the crime that leads to admission to the forensic hospital, biological father with substance misuse, and biological father with criminal convictions. The presence of half-brothers did not have significant predictive value (measured as the logscore during hill-descending variable selection) in Canada, no use of psychotropics before age 18 did not have significant predic-tive value in Sweden, and sexual abuse before age 18 and gender (no females in the dataset) did not have significant predic-tive value in Germany. However, the forced inclusion of half-brothers, no use of psychotropics before age 18 (also a plausible variable), sexual abuse before the age of 18 and gender (also a plausible variable) to the model did not worsen the accuracy of country-specific models and, thus, they were included to the models.
 3.1. Non-merger models
Country-specific information was compared with the obtained model structure. The Finnish dataset presented the highest inner validity (91.0%), while the German set displayed the lowest (84.2%), owing to the data and the chosen qualitative mod-el structure ( Table 2 ). The Swedish model was not significantly different from the Swedish default model. In the country-spe-cific models, NBCs LOOCV and accuracy results were not significantly different and in the whole sample, LOOCV and the accuracy results were equivalent. This indicates that these predictive models are quite robust in terms of resampling.
Generally, when compared to NBC, confirmatory LR produced weaker scores for smaller datasets and little higher scores for larger datasets. This was a result which has been reported also by Ng and Jordan [45] and Blomstedt et al. [31]  X  LR may perform better than NBC in larger sets and worse than NBC in smaller sets. Also during the exploratory LR modelling, the datasets were found to be complex from the variable selection view. Stepwise LR did not perform particularly well in the variable selection, if the number of potential predictors exceeded approx. 60. In contrast, all feasible (approx. 280) variables were used during NBC explorations. With a lower number of potential predictors stepwise LR learned the models well and, thus, a number of different predictions had to be done. However, the best performing LR models found were over-fitted to the learning set: they did not make particularly good predictions in the independent test sets ( Table 3 ).

Consequently, explorative LR with stepwise variable selection seemed to result to more precise estimations in the learn-greedy algorithm resulted quite directly to a feasible amount of (robust) predictors and performed surprisingly well in the reliability tests.

Fig. 1 depicts the data triangulation of predictive performance (qualitative and quantitative robustness and efficiency of the model) using NBC models. In the figure, trend lines present the country-specific models; the horizontal axis gives the name of the utilized test set for the country-specific models, and the vertical axis gives the RPV (model X  X  relative predictive value). In contrast, Fig. 2 presents RPVs for the LR models.

The general quality of the model (i.e., robustness based on the testing in different data sets) was depicted as the smooth-ness of the trend line and quantitative performance was depicted as the level of the trend. The odds for failure avoidance were where RPV represent the odds for the model X  X  success in terms of the comparison of predictive uncertainty related to com-pared models, Accuracy 1 presents the probability of the model and Accuracy instead of the model in the given prediction task.

As can be seen from Fig. 1 and based on the NBC modelling, the Finnish dataset seemed to present the average qualitative structure of the whole dataset, with high discriminative performance and robust quantitative probability structure as its trend line closely followed the trend of whole dataset and never dropped. The models with German and Swedish data did almost as well, while the Canadian model indicated volatility. However, explorative LR models were volatile in terms of
RPV ( Fig. 2 ). When observing the average RPVs of NBC models, they were higher than those observed during the LR model-ling. Here, the odds for the model X  X  success were higher using NBC than using LR. 3.2. Merger model
The Finnish dataset ( n = 78) was utilized as the likelihood in NBF due to its robustness. The German dataset ( n = 79) was used to form informative priors, because the German model seemed to be robust and differed from the Finnish dataset in that it presented a higher degree of males while indicating lower level of violence, half-brothers, psychotropics, and sexual abuse. Bayesian inference was used to assess the evidence of predictors and related POs. POs were adjusted to equal levels a priori, i.e., the mentally ill subject has an a priori 50% chance (Beta 0.5, 0.5) to become a forensic patient.
Table 4 reveals quite strong POs for patients not being admitted to forensic care if they have a background free of violent crimes. Gender and sexual abuse as a child or adolescent provided suggestive POs, while no psychotropics before the age of 18, no half-brothers as well as no substance misuse by the biological father provided weak POs, and no criminal conviction of the biological father had no significant effect on POs for protecting against admission to a forensic hospital.
When evaluating the POs of becoming a forensic psychiatric patients, the most relevant risk factors for admission to forensic psychiatry included violent crimes, conviction(s) of the biological father and no psychotropics before age 18 with quite strong POs, substance misuse by the biological father with suggestive POs, and being male as well as no sexual abuse as a child or adolescent with weak POs.

Model X  X  performance was very good (Table 5 ). Considering the inner validity, accuracy is between 86.1% and 91.0%, and the LOOCV is 85.9%. The model produces high reproducibility (test score) between 82.5% and 87.1%. Model X  X  log score is low.
The DOR is high for the Finnish data (102.0) and for the German data (93.1). The test DOR is good in the Canadian dataset (30.3) and in the Swedish dataset (80.0). Test  X  is very good for Canadian (91.8) and Swedish (83.9) test data substitutions as well as for model learning (91.0; 83.5). 4. Discussion
This case study explored protective and risk factors for a forensic admission among the mentally ill in multinational set-ting, aiming at creating a robust merged model. This exploration was carried out in a Bayesian framework, enabling us to merge multinational reference datasets into a fusion model. We also introduced a new, simple and illustrative method (rel-ative predictive value, RPV) that represents the odds for the model X  X  success in terms of the comparison of predictive uncertainty related to compared models. Although this was not mainstream artificial intelligence, this case study presented a significant effort in analysing the predictive risk factors for a forensic admission.

One of the major drawbacks of this study is that the data analyzed were matched and, thus, the results discussed here may have been weak signals behind factors with known relevance for admission to a forensic psychiatric hospital. On the other hand, obvious and largely reported reasons including sex, age, and diagnosis were matched between the groups and from this perspective we had the potential to explore new predictors for admission to a forensic psychiatric hospital.
Also, we may state that if the setting would not have been controlled, model X  X  predictive performance might have been higher.

However, all the predictors in the model were observed before the first (index) admission to the hospital. Unlike in most previous studies in this domain, the Swedish and Canadian test sets did not originate from the same distribution as the learn-ing sets  X  they were independent. All predictors included in the merger model were found to be good predictors and they are also plausible from the clinical point of view. 4.1. Clinical findings
The present study measured a wide range of social and community problems, for example, academic failure, non-com-pletion of military service, poor work adjustment, and found them to be insignificant predictors of admission to a forensic psychiatric hospital due to the commission of a violent crime. By contrast, a record of conviction for a criminal offence in the past (before the crime that led to admission) was found to be the strongest predictor of admission. In a meta-analysis [46] and one study that compared different methods for predicting violent crime [47], the prediction methods ignored the greedy
NBC. Despite this, both the meta-analysis and the study showed that criminal history variables such as prior criminal con-victions, being the victim of violence, having a history of aggressive behaviour towards others, and having been sentenced to prison were strong predictors of violent crime among offenders with severe mental illness. The results of the present study concurred in showing that violent crime prior to the index hospitalization predicted admission to a forensic admission.
The impact of the biological father X  X  antisocial behaviour measured as a conviction for a criminal offence and substance abuse was strongly associated with admission to a forensic hospital, as has been previously observed by Putkonen et al. may reflect an inter-generational transmission of a genetic vulnerability to antisocial and/or violent behaviour [50]. Second, it may result from inadequate and inappropriate parenting that characterizes parents who themselves present antisocial behaviours [51]. Third, it may result from an interaction between a specific genetic vulnerability and specific environmental factors, such as that observed between the presence of the low activity allele of the promoter region of the MAOA gene and physical maltreatment in childhood leading to conduct disorder in childhood and violent offending in adulthood among men [52]. The present study did not include genetic data for fathers which constituted the second major drawback. However, we controlled for societal reasons to specify possible genetic relations. If the data would have included genetic measures, mod-el X  X  predictive performance may have been higher.

In an additional analyses controlling for gene-related factors such as foster care that could have resulted from the father X  X  antisocial behaviour, we found that the phenomenon appeared to be more biological than social as the presence of foster ence of a dysfunctional family [51] resulting from the presence of a father who was actively engaging in antisocial behaviour.
The observed impact on half-brothers may reflect such a situation. Evidence shows that parents who are themselves anti-social provide less than optimal parenting to their children [51] and that poor parenting is associated with the development of antisocial and aggressive behaviour in children [53]. To sum up, the strength of the association with the biological father X  X  antisocial behaviour was stronger than the associations with many other psychosocial factors.

A meta-analysis reported that poor work adjustment and a diagnosis of antisocial personality were predictors of violent crime among patients with severe mental illness [46]. The present study failed to replicate these findings. Fullam et al. [54] summarized the earlier results of the violence research and suggested a relationship between psychopathy and violence in patients with schizophrenia. Again, the present study failed to replicate these results. However, the present study showed that both female gender and childhood sexual abuse can be protective factors. The finding that female gender was a protec-tive factor is not surprising given that males typically have higher rates of involvement in physical aggression and violence [55] and delinquent behaviours [56] than females. The impact of sexual abuse as a child or juvenile as protective factor was not strong and remains unexplained.

Patient X  X  substance abuse is a well-known risk factor for criminal and violent recidivism [48,57,58] . Among patients with severe mental illness, abuse of illicit drugs in the previous year has been found to increase the risk of violence by 2.5 times among the psychotic patients [47]. In the present study, both the patients admitted to the forensic hospitals and those admitted to the general psychiatric hospitals had high levels of substance abuse. Previous studies have shown, however, that after taking account of a childhood history of conduct problems, substance misuse no longer predicts aggressive behaviour towards others or violent crime [59 X 61]. This finding was supported by this study.
 The present study, however, found that the use of psychotropic medication before the age of 18 was a protective factor.
This may be a manifestation of the importance of early diagnosis and/or the result of effectiveness and compliance related to the actual pharmaceutical treatment. Other forms of treatment before the age of 18 had no robust impact regarding the admission to forensic care in this sample of patients with severe mental illness. 4.2. Modelling findings
Protective and risk factor exploration and predictions were carried out in a Bayesian framework, which enabled us to merge datasets in order to construct a robust model. Our study was data driven and we assumed an objective view. This was due to fact that we utilized matched case-control datasets, and knowledge related to the protective and risk factors for admissions to forensic psychiatry were limited and no logically coherent informative priors could be found in the liter-ature. Thus, we assumed a pragmatic approach by merging the evidence from national datasets with Bayesian methods, established a merger model and did extensive external tests for the model.

Previously, the NBC method used in this study has outperformed or equalled LR [29,31,36] and BMA [31]. However, the predictive performance depends on various factors and the performance may vary from a prediction to another prediction.
Thus, we did confirmatory LR analysis for the country-specific data and found that LR produced somewhat weaker scores for smaller datasets and little higher scores for larger datasets. Consequently, the present study concurred with previous results [31,36,45] .

However, stepwise LR did not perform particularly well in the variable selection during the exploratory LR modelling, if the number of potential predictors exceeded approx. 60. This has been observed before in a context where classification trees and regressions were compared [62]. Here, in contrast to LR, all feasible (approx. 280) variables were used during NBC explo-rations. In addition, the LR models were over-fitted to the learning set; they did not make particularly good predictions in the independent test sets.
 The predictive performance of NBC can be improved considerably with informative priors [29,31] . In these situations,
NBC X  X  performance may even exceed the performance of LR and BMA [31]. The present study also showed that the model merging with independent a prior and likelihood data does not necessarily worsen the predictive performance of the model. On the other hand, the merging has the potential to result to generalized results and simple models.

The data triangulation process of predictive model is not a simple task, for example, multiple information sources must be merged through the fusion. Fortunately, DOR is a prevalence independent indicator which is able to combine the strengths of sensitivity and specificity as a single measure for discriminatory power. The DOR introduces some positive advantages over accuracy comparison and, e.g., tolerates the two-way assessments of confidence intervals with relatively straightforward interpretation. The DOR is helpful when the balance between false positive and false negative rate is not highly important and when multiple models are being compared.

AUC analyses may be preferred to accuracy as a measure of predictive performance as this procedure can provide infor-mation which is fairly independent of the base rates of violence in different populations. Our model was able to produce very good AUC estimates when compared to previous studies of violence predictions. The high AUC levels may be a manifestation of approach X  X  performance in AUC metrics, NB X  X  efficiency in utilizing all data and justified simplifications made for the AUC estimations.

Our study indicated that the measures given by AUC or Gini, accuracy, DOR, and log score are different due to their dif-ferent perspectives for the classification and, thus, they should be used together. AUC can be extremely suitable for substi-study, the DORs and AUCs as well as Gini coefficients indicated that the actual discriminative classification modelling be-tween general and forensic patients was robust and concentrated in all datasets.

The DOR and AUC do not enable straightforward interpretation for the qualitative properties of the model. Thus, we intro-duced a new, simple and illustrative method for the data triangulation of qualitative and quantitative assessment through the relative predictive value (RPV). The qualitative and quantitative observations can be simultaneously done in terms of failure avoidance when using the informative model instead of default. The most important benefits of RPV include both sta-tistical and clinical ones: the possibility to do understandable qualitative and quantitative assessment for the modelling, and a measure which is also feasible for the medical domain in terms of model comparison (i.e., clinicians are typically hesitant to take risk and they want to avoid the risk of misprognosis). RPVs also indicated that NBC models were here quite robust in comparison to the explorative LR models. When observing the average RPVs of NBC models, they were higher than those observed during the LR modelling: the odds for the model X  X  success were higher using NBC than using LR.

We see logical rationality in the means of using the data or other sources of information which follows the aggregate trend of multiple datasets. This most evidential likelihood (i.e., data or other information set with the highest predictive va-lue among all options) has the potential to give a robust quantitative probability structure for the explored qualitative clas-sification model structure. If model averaging or merging is of interest, datasets must be logically consistent and they must be weighted for their relative plausibility derived from their accuracy.

The third and fourth major drawbacks of the analysis were also related to the case-control setting. The study lacked the size of population at risk for the studied groups and was unable to determine the incidence of violence for the predictions.
Thus, we used a uniform a priori distribution (Jeffreys Beta 0.5, 0.5) for POs. In addition, total control over matching was not achieved in the data: age and gender distributions were little different in the datasets and some control subjects were miss-ing. However, we were able to adjust the model structure for gender differences and the minor age structure difference seemed to be irrelevant as predictor. To sum up, the main limitations likely had only an insignificant impact on the predic-tions as long as it is remembered that these results apply for Canadian, Finnish, German and Swedish settings, and the data were matched for sex, age, and diagnosis.

Generally, as observations, parameters, and models are uncertain, there exist several ways to explain data with the parameters and models. Of all the plausible explanations, the simplest can be considered best, yielding the best predictions (this is the well-known Occam X  X  Razor principle). Philosophically speaking, our NB fusion approach leaned against the Razor: factors not common among national datasets may be a result of white noise or due to controversies in datasets, insignificant cultural reasons or country-specific factors. Here the quite complex modelling approach was beneficial: we did not lost in terms of log score and gained some in terms of accuracy, RPV and AUC. 5. Conclusions
This study introduced a number of applications which have not been used in the previous studies in the psychiatric do-main. The exploration was carried out in a Bayesian framework, which enabled us to merge datasets for a robust fusion mod-el. For the data triangulation, we introduced a new, simple and illustrative method called relative predictive value. The established merger model indicated both high predictive capabilities and robustness. The approach produced generalized predictors of admission to forensic psychiatric hospitals, notably antisocial behaviour in the biological father. Author contributions
