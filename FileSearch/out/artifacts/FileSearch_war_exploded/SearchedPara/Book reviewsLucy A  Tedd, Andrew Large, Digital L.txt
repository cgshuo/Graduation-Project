As befits the work of these two authors, this is a splendidly written book that quickly takes the reader from the dawn of library time to the current day in the context of the digital library. This is an all-inclusive work, which encompasses the international spectrum but also the consequences of aspects as wide-ranging as lan-guage, web page design, legal and quality issues and visual impairment. The book, which sets out to introduce readers to the principles underlying digital libraries, properly starts with an explanation of the capabilities of such resources from the viewpoint of proselytizing the world  X  s greatest library treasures, together with their historiography, definition and potential benefit to information users.

The second chapter considers the various applications of digital libraries in different environments integrat-ing the concept with consideration of Virtual Learning Environments and Portals as well as access issues. The third chapter describes various sources that can be combined into digital libraries including scholarly e-jour-nals, repositories and e-books but also considers metadata, multimedia and indexing sources. Even in these relatively few pages it should already be clear that the reader has been transported through a comprehensive continuum devoted to an exploration of all aspects relating to digital libraries and may already be wondering what can be left to fill the remaining pages.

In fact, there is much more as the rest of the book explores standards and interoperability, the role of li-brary management systems and open source software, search techniques, preservation issues and concludes with a short list of principles for digital library development and a helpful list of core journals covering this topic. The final chapter is a description of eight case studies of digital library implementation. Each study highlights significant and useful issues and is worthy of inclusion although it is certain that when taken as a whole, they do not provide a comprehensive picture of all the facets of digital libraries and that will not have been the authors  X  intentions anyway.

The book is full of monochrome screen shots (at least 115) which are informative and help to explain aspects detailed in the prose X  X lthough the images are sometimes difficult to read. In an ideal world, these would have been reproduced in colour to aid visibility and improve the overall physical quality of the volume. Perhaps it could be reproduced in an e-book format in due course? In many ways this is a reference work and, with exten-sive and well-researched bibliographies. It provides the means for the reader to dip into a relevant section, obtain a useful understanding of the core concepts relating to areas as diverse as Open Archives or Metadata, website design or accessibility, and still be able to read more about the subject elsewhere if more detail is required.
It is not a book to read from cover to cover in one go and the substantial price may preclude it becoming an obligatory acquisition for students of information science X  X lthough that is where it belongs. This is a fast-moving subject and it is difficult to see how the work will stand the test of time in its current format X  X ut that is not a criticism and there is plenty of scope for subsequent editions.
