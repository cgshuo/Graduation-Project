 This paper demonstrates Treo , a natural language query mechanism for Linked Data graphs. The approach uses a distributional semantic vector space model to semantically match user query terms with data, supporting vocabulary-independent (or schema-agnostic) queries over structured data.

Structured data is becoming a central element in the evo-lution of the Web search experience. Applications such as Google Knowledge Graph 1 are using structured data to pro-vide direct answers to users X  informational queries. The use of knowledge graphs in search engines is synchronized with the growth of structured and open data available on the Web, in particular, Linked Open Data.

Within the realm of the Web and Big Data, databases fol-lowing the Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) are becoming pro-gressively more popular, where data is more sparse and the schema is more complex and heterogeneous. Consuming this data demands search/query mechanisms with the semantic flexibility necessary to cope with the semantic gap that ex-ists between user queries and the representation of the data. Traditional structured query mechanisms for databases al-low expressive queries at the expense of usability: the se-mantic matching process is delegated to data consumers (in http://googleblog.blogspot.ie/2012/05/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not.htm, 2012 the construction of SQL or SPARQL queries). On the other side of the usability spectrum, information retrieval (IR) ap-proaches allow users to search using intuitive keyword-based interfaces. High usability comes at the expense of query ex-pressivity and effectiveness. Traditional IR approaches do not provide expressive queries over structured data. At the core of this usability-expressivity trade-off is the semantic gap between the way users express their information needs and the way structured data is represented. By addressing this semantic gap, vocabulary-independent/schema-agnostic queries provide users with greater freedom and efficiency for querying and searching large heterogeneous data sources.
This paper presents the demonstration for Treo ,avocab-ulary independent query mechanism for Linked Data graphs and EAV databases. Treo allows users to search over EAV Databases using expressive natural language queries. To enable semantic flexibility and vocabulary independency, a principled distributional-compositional semantic model [3] is used to build a distributional structured vector space model (T-Space). The distributional semantics component of the model, based on the Explicit Semantic Analysis [2], sup-ports a semantic approximation between query and dataset terms: operations in the T-Space are mapped to semantic relatedness operations using the distributional background knowledge of Wikipedia. The robustness of distributional semantics, compared to WordNet based or ontology-based approaches, lies in the scope of its semantic matching, which allows matching between terms from different grammatical classes and it is not dependent on manually created struc-tured resources (distributional semantic models are auto-matically built from texts).

The elements of the query processing approach are de-picted in Figure 1. In the query pre-processing phase the nat-ural language query is analyzed by the Interpreter compo-nent, where a set of query patterns and features are detected in the user query. The second phase consists of the vocabu-lary independent query processing approach which defines a sequence of search and data transformation operations over the data graph embedded in the T-Space, targeting a maxi-mum semantic matching with the query. The Query Planner generates the sequence of graph semantic search and navi-gation operations which defines the query processing plan , basedonasetof query features which are determined in the pre-processing phase. Each query feature maps to a set of graph search and navigation operations. The third phase consists in the execution of the query processing plan op-erations over the T-Space index. The T-Space VSM model index is implemented over Lucene 3.5 IR framework.
The system is demonstrated over the open-domain DB-pedia 3.7 and YAGO Linked datasets 2 . The full dataset consists of 128,071,259 triples (17GB) loaded into the Treo index. A set of natural language queries from the Question Answering over Linked Data Challenge [1], extracted from real user queries, are used to demonstrate the system. Users input free natural language queries and the system returns two types of results: (i) a list of highly related triples or (ii) post-processed/aggregate results, depending on the query type.
 For the example query (A)  X  X ho is the daughter of Bill Clinton married to ? X  (Figure 2), the system returns a list of triples which have the answer for the user query, includ-ing the final answer  X  X ill Clinton X  X  child is Chelsea Clinton X  and Chelsea Clinton X  X  spouse is Marc Mezvinsky . This query also returns related triples which are not the answer for the query but which can be quickly filtered by users. This se-mantic best-effort behavior places Treo in a hybrid scenario between a question answering and a semantic search system. In the example, the distributional semantic model was used to match daughter to child and married to spouse .Forthe second query (B),  X  X hat is the highest mountain ? X  (Fig-ure 2), the system returns a precise answer. In answering this query, the system first determined the class Mountain in the dataset, expanding all instances associated with this class. The system used the distributional semantic infor-mation to match highest with all properties available for the instances of Mountain , finding elevation to be the most related. The next step sorts all instances by elevation and retrieves the top most triple. Further examples can be found at the Treo website 3 . PowerAqua [4] is a question answering system which uses PowerMap, a hybrid matching algorithm comprising ter-minology level and structural schema matching techniques with the assistance of large scale ontological or lexical re-sources. In addition to the ontology structure, PowerMap http://dbpedia.org http://treo.deri.ie/SIGIRDemo Figure 2: Example queries: (A) semantic best-effort answer (B) exact answer. uses WordNet-based similarity approaches as a semantic ap-proximation strategy. Exploring user interaction techniques, FREyA [5] is a QA system which employs feedback and clar-ification dialogs to resolve ambiguities and improve the do-main lexicon with the help of users. User feedback is also used to enrich the semantic matching process by allowing manual input of query-vocabulary mappings. Compared to existing approaches, Treo focuses on the use of distributional semantic models to support a more comprehensive query-data matching mechanism, with a lower adaptation effort for new datasets. Additionally, Treo uses a distributional struc-tured vector space model (T-Space) [3] to support seman-tically approximate queries over labelled data graphs (EAV data model), providing a principled associated IR framework over structured data.
