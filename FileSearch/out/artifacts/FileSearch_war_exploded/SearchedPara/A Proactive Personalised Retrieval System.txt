 We present a personalised retrieval system that captures ex-plicit relevance feedback to build an evolving user profile with multiple aspects. The user profile is used to proac-tively retrieve results between search sessions to support multi-session search tasks. This approach to supporting users with their multi-session search tasks is evaluated in a between-subjects multiple time-series study with ten sub-jects performing two simulated work situation tasks over five sessions. System interaction data shows that subjects using the personalised retrieval system issue fewer queries and in-teract with fewer results than subjects using a baseline sys-tem. The interaction data also shows a trend of subjects interacting with the proactively retrieved results in the per-sonalised retrieval system.

Many information retrieval systems are designed with the assumption that users typically perform single-session search tasks. In a recent survey of information seeking habits, how-ever, Morris et al. [6] found that 83% of people had experi-enced a search task spanning more than one session and 73% of those respondents experienced multi-session tasks with at least one day passing between search sessions. These find-ings suggest that: (i) information needs are not static but that they evolve as people interact with information objects; (ii) people could benefit from having their evolving informa-tion needs assisted by a retrieval system.

In this paper, we propose a personalised retrieval system that captures and models different aspects of evolving infor-mation needs for complex multi-session Web search tasks. The evolving user profile is used to proactively retrieve re-sults between search sessions to assist users with their search tasks. The main research question we explore is whether the personalised retrieval system can reduce the number of queries issued and the number of interactions performed with search results without compromising the search experi-ence. We hypothesise that the personalised retrieval system will reduce the need for subjects to manually initiate search sessions because the system will be able to proactively re-trieve relevant information on their behalf. To study this research question, we will perform a between-subjects mul-tiple time-series experiment using two equally complex sim-ulated work situation tasks using the personalised retrieval system and a baseline Web retrieval system.

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Sec-tion 2 provides an overview of related research on interac-tive information retrieval systems and information retrieval evaluation techniques. Section 3 describes the personalised retrieval system used in this study. Section 4 presents the evaluation methodology of this study and Section 5 presents results and discussion.
Contextual information retrieval techniques have been ex-plored in the short-term [8], long-term [9], and interactive settings [4]. In the short-term, Shen et al. [8] exploited the search context of the immediate session to improve the ac-curacy of a retrieval system based on evolving interactions. In the long-term, Tan et al. [9] demonstrated an application of a statistical language modelling technique to mine long-term Web search history to improve the accuracy of search queries. In an interactive setting, Harper and Kelly [4] pre-sented a study of an interactive contextual retrieval system based on a pile-based interface metaphor. In this paper, we present a retrieval system that models evolving and multi-aspect information needs through explicit relevance feedback in an interactive setting and retrieves results on behalf of the user to support their multi-session tasks.
Traditional information retrieval evaluation techniques typ-ically comprise three components: a document collection, topic descriptions defining information needs, and a set of relevance judgements for topic description-document pairs to provide a ground truth for performance analysis [10]. This approach, however, is usually unsuitable for interac-tive information retrieval because there is rarely a set of relevant judgements and document collections are usually non-standard. Kelly et al. [5] recently stressed that the main evaluation challenges for information seeking support systems are adequate user and task models, test corpora, task complexity and task evolution, and the lack of longi-tudinal designs. With consideration of these challenges, we propose a multi-session study to measure the performance of the proposed system with two complex simulated work situation tasks [1] designed from task complexity theory [2].
The personalised retrieval system is a web application comprising a separate backend and frontend. The back-end consists of components for interaction logging, book-mark management, Web retrieval, session clustering, index-ing, and user modelling. The frontend consists of interfaces for user profile management, bookmark management, rec-ommendations, and Web search.

In the backend, a new search session is created when the user issues a query and terminated when the user either issues a new, dissimilar query. The similarity of queries be-tween search sessions is calculated using the cosine similar-ity of the terms used in the current and the previous query, with the similarity threshold set to 0.35. The retrieval sys-tem uses the Google SOAP Search API 1 to retrieve results for a given search query from the Web. The retrieved re-sults are indexed ad-hoc using tf-idf on the snippet content of each result in the session. If at least one result for a query is marked as explicitly relevant, the search session is added to the user profile as indicative of the evolving information needs of the user. When a search session is added to the user profile, an attempt is made to cluster it with previ-ous search sessions. A cluster of search sessions is stored in date ascending order to facilitate relevance discounting of the most defining terms extracted from the relevant results, as described in Section 3.3.

In the frontend, queries are submitted to the system by selecting the search interface, and issuing a query. A list of results is returned and users can view the content of each re-sult and save each result as explicitly relevant by clicking the save button. The user profile management interface is pre-sented as a list of aspects with a title, taken from the most recently added search session X  X  query, and a list of terms which define the personalised query for that cluster. The set of defining terms is calculated using the technique de-scribed in Section 3.3. Users can modify the defining terms of an aspect to suit their needs and this results in terms being suggested to the user instead of used by the system. The bookmarked results interface is presented as a set of aspects based on the clustering of search sessions. Web re-sult recommendations are presented as a list of aspects, each containing up to ten Web results for the different aspects of their user profile. The recommended results can be viewed and saved in the same manner as the search results.
In the personalised retrieval system, the evolving context of information needs is modelled using the Ostensive Model (OM) [3]. The OM is a model of developing information http://code.google.com/apis/soapsearch/ needs where the user X  X  needs are described as a set of infor-mation objects across time. For example, a user searching for photographs of the Eiffel Tower could use a photo brows-ing system to select photos that match their need. In the OM, the action of selecting images as relevant defines the evolving context of their information needs with respect to their interactions. The personalised retrieval system allows users to mark results as explicitly relevant to let them define their information needs. Continuing with the Eiffel Tower example, a browse-based retrieval system, such as the sys-tem proposed by Campbell [3], immediately updates the set of information objects available to the user based on their interactions. In a query-based system, however, we believe that immediately changing the search results would frustrate users.

Formally, the OM consists of a set of evolving states split into observable and unobservable states. The observable states are the action the user performs, A 0 ; and the infor-mation object the action is performed on, I 0 . The unobserv-able states are the initial knowledge state of the user, K exposure of the user to the item, E 0 ; and the new knowl-edge state as a result of the exposure, K 1 . We assume that the observable states in the model can be used to make as-sumptions about the evolving information needs of the user. With this assumption, the knowledge states, { K 0 , K 1 , ... } , are analogous to the user attempting to formulate a query to satisfy their information need and the exposure of the user to an information object represents the evolving context of the user. We propose that each set of interactions with re-spect to a query represent a change in the knowledge state of the user. This addition to the model leads from the ex-posure states back to the action states to avoid immediately updating the set of objects available for user interaction. Given an evolving user modelling technique based on the Ostensive Model, the challenge is how to capture and rep-resent different aspects of search behaviour. We propose to achieve this by clustering search sessions where the user has engaged in explicit relevance feedback to create an evolving time-line of each aspect of the user X  X  behaviour.

Formally, the profile P u for user u consists of zero or more interests, { I i 1 ,u , I i 2 ,u , . . . } . Interest I collection of one or more search sessions, { S q 1 ,i 1 ,u . . . } . Search session S q 1 ,i 1 ,u of interest i 1 collection of explicitly relevant documents and the defining terms extracted from those documents.

The action of submitting a query to the retrieval system marks the start of a search session from which an aspect of the user X  X  evolving information needs can be captured. A search session ends if the user submits a dissimilar query to their previous query, which is calculated using the cosine similarity of the terms used in the current and the previous query, with the similarity threshold set to 0.35. This simi-larity value is chosen because it was shown to appropriately model evolving search sessions by Psarras and Jose [7]. Fur-thermore, if search sessions are stored as date-ordered collec-tions of explicitly relevant search results, the most defining terms extracted from the snippet content of those results, and the query issued, then the set of defining terms for a search session is a set of term, weight pairs: { t a ,w t all terms extracted from Web results during the search ses-sion, as shown in Definition 1.
This set of weighted terms represents one search session of one aspect the user X  X  evolving interactions with the retrieval system. The overall relevance of the terms that define a cluster of search sessions is calculated using an increasing-uncertainty-with-age discounting function [3]. This discount-ing function promotes the significance of the terms that de-fine interactions in more recent search sessions. The dis-counted weight of a term in an interest is calculated using Equation 2, with  X  = 0 . 5 because Campbell demonstrated this is appropriate for discounting the relevance of previous feedback relative to more recent feedback [3].
 The set of defining terms for an interest is a set of term, (ostensive)-weight pairs: { t a ,OW t a } , for each term in the search sessions which comprise the interest, as seen in Defi-nition 3.
Finally, the similarity of search sessions in an interest is given by the cosine similarity between the discounted terms in each search session of an interest. This can be seen in Definition 4.
The five terms with the highest ostensive weight for an interest form the terms which define an interest, as shown in Definition 3. These five terms are used by the personalised retrieval system to retrieve documents on behalf of the user for the different aspects (interests) of their user profile.
The major research question we pose is whether the per-sonalised retrieval system can reduce the number of queries issued by subjects and subsequent interactions with search results without compromising search experience. We hy-pothesise that the personalised retrieval system will reduce the need for subjects to manually initiate query sessions be-cause the system is able to proactively retrieve relevant infor-mation on their behalf. To explore this research question, we prepared a baseline system for a comparative analysis and two complex simulated work situation tasks.
The baseline retrieval system is similar in appearance and functionality to the personalised retrieval system with a few exceptions. Firstly, subjects cannot view the profile man-agement interface because they do not have a user profile. Secondly, subjects cannot view the recommendations inter-face because the system does not pro-actively retrieve results on their behalf. Finally, saved results are not presented as-pectually; they are presented as a single list.
We prepared two simulated work situation tasks [1] in conjunction with Campbell X  X  task complexity taxonomy [2] and Zigurs et al. X  X  [11] coding instructions. The tasks used were  X  X roblem type X  tasks, which generally feature multiple potential solutions, conflicting interdependence between so-lutions, and solution-outcome uncertainty. This type of task was chosen to stimulate a potentially evolving information need that could be explored over several search sessions. The topics for the tasks were Formula 1 Racing and The World Economy. We prepared two tasks of identical theoretical complexity because we wanted to reduce the threat of task complexity being a potential reason for differences in this study.
Ten subjects were recruited via a department-wide email and were randomly allocated to use either the baseline or personalised retrieval system. Each subject was invited to the experimenter X  X  office to complete the first session of each task. After giving consent to take part in the study, subjects were asked to complete a demographic questionnaire and perform a training session using a written tutorial. After completing the training session, subjects were handed a task description and asked to complete a pre-task questionnaire to elicit their impressions of the complexity of the task. Sub-jects then proceeded to perform a ten minute search session using the retrieval system in pursuit of the task and complete a system questionnaire to elicit their impressions about the retrieval system they used. This was repeated for the second task. The order of tasks allocated to subjects was rotated to reduce threats from learning effects between tasks. Before leaving the office, subjects were handed a folder containing the system tutorial for the system they were assigned to use, the task descriptions, and the experiment schedule. Subjects completed the remaining four search sessions for each task on their own computers by logging into the retrieval sys-tem through a Web-based interface. After the third search session for each task, subjects completed a system question-naire. After the fifth search session for each task, subjects completed a post-task questionnaire and a system question-naire and finally an exit questionnaire. Finally, subjects returned to receive a payment of  X  15.
In the demographic questionnaire, 9 males and 1 female reported an average age of 28.5 years old, with a range 25-35. All subjects indicated they were fluent speakers of English, used Web search engines every day, and nearly always found what they were looking for using Web search engines.
To measure the performance of the retrieval systems, we captured the interactions performed by each subject during each search session. Table 1 shows the average number of manually issued queries, Q , the average number of results viewed, V , the average number of results viewed and sub-sequently saved, S , and the average session duration, T , for the personalised retrieval system, S Pers , and the baseline system, S Base . There is a clear trend of subjects assigned to S Pers issuing fewer queries and viewing fewer results to find relevant information. We note that subjects using S Pers spend a similar length of time on their sessions when com-pared to subjects using S Base , which suggests they do not disengage with the system due to frustration. We argue that the reason for the difference observed in interactions between S
Pers and S Base is due to the quality of the session. This is supported by questionnaire responses, in which subjects using S Pers report that the system helps them to save time and helps them to find results for different aspects of their tasks compared to responses from subjects using S Base .
We also captured the interactions performed by subjects using S Pers with their recommendations, as shown in Table 2. The average number of results viewed, V , and average number of results saved, S , is shown. The results show a slight trend of increasing interaction with the recommenda-tion results as the search task progresses from the first to fifth session. This provides some evidence that subjects us-ing S Pers are receiving additional relevant information with-out needing to search for it themselves.

A potential threat to this interpretation of the system in-teraction data is that the tasks affected subject performance. Table 3 shows interaction data between tasks. In this table, T F 1 refers to the Formula 1 task and T Econ refers to the Economy task. In comparison with Table 1, there is not a clear trend of subjects issuing fewer queries or viewing fewer results for either task. Given this observation, we argue that there is no indication that the tasks were responsible for sub-jects issuing fewer queries or viewing fewer results.

As future work, we propose to evaluate the effectiveness of different context modelling techniques for defining and evolving the representation of a user profile in multi-session Web search. We also propose to evaluate the effectiveness of this type of retrieval systems for different types of complex tasks to see if the support is independent of task type.
