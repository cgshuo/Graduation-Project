 The international workshop on Mining for and from the Se-mantic Web (MSW) at the KDD 2004 successfully brought together people from the communities Semantic Web and Knowledge Discovery. The goal of the workshop was to strengthen the communication and interaction between these communities as there is currently an agreement that both can benefit largely from each other. Overall the contribu-tions and discussions showed that today mining for the se-mantic web is the primarily targeted research area. How-ever, with a growing amount of available semantic web data also mining from the semantic web will be more prominent. The international workshop on Mining for and from the Se-mantic Web was located at the 10th International ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Min-ing (KDD 2004) on Sunday, the 22nd August 2004, in Seat-tle, WA, USA.
 The workshop successfully brought together researchers from the research areas Semantic Web and Knowledge Discovery. According to T. Berners-Lee the Semantic Web is  X  X n ex-tension of the current web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and peo-ple to work in cooperation X . Current standardization efforts include e.g. the W3C recommendation for the Web Ontol-ogy Language 1 (OWL). Knowledge Discovery is defined by U.M. Fayyad as  X  X he nontrivial process of identifying valid, previously unknown, potentially useful patterns in data X . The combination of these two fast developing research areas is often called semantic web mining and addresses research questions trying to combine methods and technologies from both research areas.
 The workshop followed a series of related workshops on On-tology Learning at ECAI 2000 and Semantic Web Mining at ECML/PKDD 2001 and 2002. Its call-for-papers generated contributions from North America, Europe and Asia. The nine accepted papers which were accompanied by an invited talk covered a wide range of issues falling into categories such as Text Mining and Semantics, Mining Structures and Tools, Frameworks and Applications. see http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/ The idea of using formally represented background knowl-edge in a text classification task was presented in Boosting for Text Classification with Semantic Features given by An-dreas Hotho. Different linguistic ontologies were used as basis for an empirical evaluation with well-known corpora. The two talks Integrating Web Conceptual Modeling and Web Usage Mining by Rosa Meo and Discovering Links be-tween Lexical and Surface Features in Questions and An-swers by Soumen Chakrabarti were mainly contributions to the WebKDD workshop. Rosa Meo presented an approach to use a conceptual log based on WebML which allows for easy analysis of usage behavior. Soumen Chakrabati pre-sented a data driven machine learning approach to retrieve short passages from html pages for giving answers to given questions. The approach relied on linguistic methods to im-prove the quality of the model. Overall the contribution and discussions showed that today mining for the semantic web is the primarily targeted re-search area. However, with a growing amount of available semantic web data also mining from the semantic web, e.g. by using approaches such as ILP and relational data mining, will be more prominent.
 We thank all presenters and participants for the stimulating environment and interesting discussions. We hope that all benefited and enjoyed the workshop as much as we did and we are looking forward to continuing the exciting work in the shared research space of the communities on Semantic Web and Knowledge Discovery.
