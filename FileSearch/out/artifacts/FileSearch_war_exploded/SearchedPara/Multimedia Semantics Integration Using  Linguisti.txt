 In recent years, the rapid expansion of mul timedia applications, partly due to the ex-ponential growth of distributed and portable computing devices, has proliferated over the daily life of computer users. Consequently, research on multimedia technologies is based systems, multimedia applications usually incorporate much more powerful descriptions of human thought  X  video, audio, and images. Moreover, the large collec-operations such as imprecise query or content-based retrieval. However, the conven-iences of multimedia applications come with challenges to the existing data manage-ment schemes: 
First, multimedia applications generally require more resources; however, the stor-devices and wireless networks [1,10]. Due to the large data volume and complicated operations of multimedia applications, new methods are needed to facilitate efficient representation, accessing, and processing of multimedia data while considering the technical constraints. 
In addition, there is a gap between user perception of multimedia entities and physi-cal represent-and-access mechanism of multimedia data. Users often browse and desire to access multimedia data at the object level ( X  X ntities X  such as human beings, animals, This representation gap often leads to unexpected retrieval results. The representation of classification of objects from general multimedia data collections. 
Moreover, the collections of multimedia data are often diverse and poorly indexed [3]. In a distributed environment, due to the autonomy and heterogeneity of data objects under a unique indexing framework. 
Last but not the least, the present research on content-based multimedia retrieval is based on feature vectors. These features are extracted from the audio/video streams or image pixels, with the empirical or heuristic selection, and then combined into vectors formats, this paradigm of multimedia data management lacks scalability, accuracy, efficiency, and robustness [3]. 
Motivated by the aforementioned challenges, in this work we introduce a semantic-aware paradigm that organizes the multimedia data objects based on concise and abstract description of data contents, and summarizes the data contents from different data sources as semantically equivalent and globally recognizable terms. To show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed paradigm, a simulator was developed to compare and contrast our method against several content-based searching methods as proposed in the literature. overviews the related work and background materials. Section 3 addresses the semantic representation of multimedia data objects and introduces an automated linguistic ap-conclusions. 2.1 Content Analysis Due to the aforementioned importance of mu ltimedia content processing, recent re-search work focused on organizing multimedia data based on their contents [1]. Con-tent-based retrieval systems have attempted to provide solutions to multimedia images as whole objects. This object-oriented view on multimedia content processing has led to the research on two tracks: single-modal content processing and cross-modal content processing. 
The single-modal processing focuses on content information within a single modal-domain-specific applications (such as face recognition [6]), with less emphasis on general-purpose object detection methods [7]. Moreover, the probabilistic schemes sometimes user feedback to classify and detect objects of interest. 
The cross-modal processing obtains content information by fusing visual-audio data and retrieving camera operations such as zooming or tracking. The recent re-search has focused on context-extraction m odels (Latent Semantic Index, Canonical complex matrix computations. 
However, multimedia applications usually generate large volume of data. As a re-need for a set of quantitative parameters that can be used for multimedia content rep-resentation as well as content-based operations such as similarity comparisons. 
In most content-representation systems that have advanced in the literature [1], the consider each feature as a dimension, a multi media object can also be considered as a vertex in the high-dimensional feature sp ace. Different multimedia object s are charac-high-dimensional feature space. The boundaries between these regions distinguish the content differences between multimedia objects. Generally, the boundaries cannot be described by linear discriminant equations [7]; hence, some refined description meth-employed for classifying multimedia objects based on their features [11]. The feature extraction is the process of mapping multimed ia objects into vertices in feature space. The extracted features are usually domain-s pecific characteristics that can distinguish the  X  X bject of interest X  from a large number of multimedia objects. 
There are two common types of features in multimedia retrieval systems: granule-level features and object-level features. The granule-level features are those character-storage  X  i.e., the pixels, such as hue, textures, and saturation. The object-level fea-tures, in contrast, are obtained from the recognition of the higher-level understanding of the multimedia data  X  the semantic topics of the multimedia data. 
Most existing multimedia retrieval systems tend to use granule-level features for semantic concepts from multimedia raw data [7]. However, human X  X  perception of becoming important in recent years, and many models were proposed for efficient extraction of objects from multimedia data. background patterns. The major challenge in object detection is the definition of distinc-exist in the world at large. For instance, human faces vary in color, aging, facial expres-sion, and in small disguises such as the facial hair, glasses, or cosmetics. The illumina-other visual patterns that may occur in th e world, such as similar looking objects. 
Based on domain-specific knowledge or empirical observations, several experi-mental systems were built for detection of certain types of multimedia objects, such as face identification from images or video segments [12]. However, it is much more complex to build an object-detection system for general-purpose recognition of ob-jects, such as analyzing the animals in a given image. Normally, most existing object-instead they provide approximate recognition for given objects. As mentioned before, a multimedia system usually maps multimedia data objects to vertices in a high-dimensional space of granule-level features. A given multimedia data object may reside in small region, surrounded by other objects that are semantically similar to it. Bigger distance between vertices in the feature space means smaller content similarity between multimedia data objects. 2.2 Logic-Based Semantic Description To represent the contents of multimedia data objects in a computer-friendly struc-cording to their semantic contents. Definition 1: The Elementary Entities p p then be defined as: Definition 2: The Mult imedia Data Objects A multimedia data object is the combination of a series of elementary entities. Given data object can be defined as: of logic terms, whose value represents the semantic content. The analysis of semantic This content representation approach has at least the following advantages: 1. The logic terms provide a convenient way to describe semantic contents con-3.

Based on the equivalence of logic terms, the semantically similar objects can be 3.1 Logic Expression Set mental logic expressions, the semantic relationships between these data objects can be Because any practical multimedia database only consists of limited number of data combination of several objects from the object set I S . Definition 3: The Instance-Of Relationship Then an on-line thesaurus  X  (e.g. Roget X  X  thesaurus or Wordnet) can be used to define  X  is an instance of S i , denoted as S i  X  X   X  ; S j . Definition 4: The Is-A Relationship as S i  X  X   X   X  S j . It can be proven that the instance-of/is-a (or hypernym/hyponym) relationships are a mantic contents. Based on the hypernym/hyponym relationships, a Hasse diagram shaped hierarchy can be constructed to indi cate the routes of searching semantic con-cepts within a closed linguistic system. Definition 5: The Polysemy Relationship Some multimedia data objects may contain words that can be interpreted as ambigu-ous semantic meanings, which are collectively defined as polysemy. The probability branches in the Hasse diagram hierarchy, because the tree-shaped hierarchies are defined as single-ancestor relationships and therefore are free from polysemy. In other terms, the polysemy probability can be formalized as: semantic content of x and not shared with other subsets. Definition 6: The Homology Relationship In a multimedia database, the homology relationships exist among the semantically physical locations. Given two multimedia data objects S i and S j , their homology rela-tionship can be defined as: Definition 7: The Heterology Relationship The heterology relationship shows the opposite semantic features of two multimedia linguistic domain, their semantic contents cannot have homology, instance-of, or is-a relationships. For instance,  X  X n X  and  X  X ut X ,  X  X p X  and  X  X own X ,  X  X ove X  and  X  X top X  are and this type of concepts form the relationship of heterology denoted as: Definition 8: The Share-With Relationship Given a multimedia data object and the content-relationship function as defined by share-with relationship can be defined as: 3.2 Content Integration We have two major goals in the content integration process as follows:  X  Specify the hidden semantic relationships among the multimedia data objects, and  X  Minimize the logic-based representation of the exported terms. 
These objectives allow higher QoS and performance, respectively. Inspired by the formation of Karnaugh Maps [9], we designed a combinatorial optimization table to shorten the complex combinations of features into condensed logic terms. The opti-mization table is a k -dimensional table where k is the size of the feature sets represent-multimedia data object. The semantics integration process is performed on this com-binatorial optimization table in the following phases: Phase 1 : Semantic domain partitioning 
The partitioning of semantic domain provides a means of representing and orga-nizing multimedia data objects based on their semantic contents. Given a collection description of their common semantic features. 1. G = 2. x = t ( I , G ) 3. I = I  X  { x } 4. WHILE | I | &gt; 0 DO 5. g = s ( x , G ) 6. IF (distance of x and g &lt; threshold) 7. g = g U { x } 8. create Boolean set with size log ( a ( g )) 9. ELSE 10. G = G U {{ x }} 11.RETURN the Boolean variable sets

A combinatorial optimization table is constructed. Each cell is labeled with a com-bination of Boolean variables, either in the original form or in the complement form. As the indication of semantic content, the cells are filled with  X 1 X  X ,  X 0 X  X , or  X * X  X . The  X * X  X  indicate the non-applicable cases. Adjacent cells set to  X 1 X  X  indicates the multi-media entities share some common features. Hence, we can cluster the  X  X eighboring X  entities with the common features as a semantically similar group. The clustering process is performed as indicated in the following rules:  X  Each cluster contains 2 k adjacent 1s in a rectangular region in the combinatorial  X  The clusters with over 50% overlapping are merged into a larger cluster, which  X  For the adjacent orthogonal clusters, check with the on-line thesaurus  X  and de-Phase 3 : Content-based retrieval 12.

The insertion, deletion and normal retrieval are proved separately. 1) The insertion of multimedia data objects starts at a non-dividable cluster and 3) As noted before, the normal retrieval is restricted in a sub branch of the Hasse retrieval in this hierarchy is O ( log m n + log 2 k ). order the data objects according to their semantic similarities, the second step takes O ( log 2 k ) time. Consequently, the total time is O ( log m n + log 2 k ). We proposed a novel content-aware retrieval model for multimedia data objects in heterogeneous distributed database environment. In contrast with the traditional fea-ture-based indexing models, the proposed model employs a concise descriptive term to represent the semantic contents of multimedia objects. In short, the proposed model offers the following advantages: (1) the concise descriptions accurately represent the semantic contents of multimedia data objects using optimized logic terms; (2) the descriptive terms enable the search engine with capability of handling imprecise que-ries. Our future work would include improvements of the proposed model, such as more efficient search strategies and adaptation to cross-modal multimedia data.
