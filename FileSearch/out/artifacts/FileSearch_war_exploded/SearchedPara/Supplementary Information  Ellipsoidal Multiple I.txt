Buhmann jbuhmann@inf.ethz.ch Department of Computer Science, ETH Zurich, Switzerland Proof of Lemma 3. We make use of the following mul-tivariate Chebyshev X  X  inequality to proof Lemma 3 Theorem 1. (Marshall &amp; Olkin, 1960), (Bertsimas &amp; Popescu, 2001), (Lanckriet et al., 2002) Where y is a random vector, the supremum is over all distributions for y with mean  X  y and covariance matrix  X  y and S is a given convex set.
 the claimed equality.
 Proof of Lemma 4. We follow the proof in (Lanck-riet et al., 2002) to find a closed form expression for inf x and the infimum becomes 0.
 c We form the Lagrangian: and maximize it with respect to the dual variable  X   X  0 At the optimum we get 2 k =  X  c and f =  X  c , k  X  . So, and add it as a constraint: Finally we see that this quadratic constraint is equiva-lent to the SOC constraint in Equation 22 in the main article.
 Proof of Proposition 1. We would like to minimize the squared distance between a point x on the hyperplane, and a point z on the ellipsoid. This can be expressed as the following constrained optimisation problem: We form the Lagrangian, using multiplier  X  for the ellipsoidal constraint and  X  for the hyperplane. Taking the gradient of Equation (4) with respect to x and z respectively, and setting it to zero gives By substituting Equation (5) into Equation (6), we obtain that and using this in Equation (5) gives By substituting Equation (7) and (8) into the La-grangian (Equation (4)) we obtain an expression only in the dual variables.
