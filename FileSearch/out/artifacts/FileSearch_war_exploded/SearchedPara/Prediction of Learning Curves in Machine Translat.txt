 Parallel data in the domain of interest is the key re-source when training a statistical machine transla-tion (SMT) system for a specific business purpose. In many cases it is possible to allocate some budget for manually translating a limited sample of relevant documents, be it via professional translation services or through increasingly fashionable crowdsourcing. However, it is often difficult to predict how much training data will be required to achieve satisfactory translation accuracy, preventing sound provisional budgetting. This prediction, or more generally the prediction of the learning curve of an SMT system as a function of available in-domain parallel data, is the objective of this paper.

We consider two scenarios, representative of real-istic situations. 1. In the first scenario (S1), the SMT developer is 2. In the second scenario (S2), an additional small In both cases, the task consists in predicting an eval-uation score (BLEU, throughout this work) on the test corpus as a function of the size of a subset of the source sample, assuming that we could have it manually translated and use the resulting bilingual corpus for training.

In this paper we provide the following contribu-tions: 1. An extensive study across six parametric func-2. A method for inferring learning curves based 3. A method for extrapolating the learning curve 4. A method for combining the two approaches
In this study we limit tuning to the mixing param-eters of the Moses log-linear model through MERT, keeping all meta-parameters (e.g. maximum phrase length, maximum allowed distortion, etc.) at their default values. One can expect further tweaking to lead to performance improvements, but this was a necessary simplification in order to execute the tests on a sufficiently large scale.

Our experiments involve 30 distinct language pair and domain combinations and 96 different learning curves. They show that without any parallel data we can predict the expected translation accuracy at 75K segments within an error of 6 BLEU points (Ta-ble 4), while using a seed training corpus of 10K segments narrows this error to within 1.5 points (Ta-ble 6). Learning curves are routinely used to illustrate how the performance of experimental methods depend on the amount of training data used. In the SMT area, Koehn et al. (2003) used learning curves to compare performance for various meta-parameter settings such as maximum phrase length , while Turchi et al. (2008) extensively studied the be-haviour of learning curves under a number of test conditions on Spanish-English. In Birch et al. (2008), the authors examined corpus features that contribute most to the machine translation perfor-mance. Their results showed that the most predic-tive features were the morphological complexity of the languages, their linguistic relatedness and their word-order divergence; in our work, we make use of these features, among others, for predicting transla-tion accuracy (Section 4).

In a Machine Learning context, Perlich et al. (2003) used learning curves for predicting maximum performance bounds of learning algorithms and to compare them. In Gu et al. (2001), the learning curves of two classification algorithms were mod-elled for eight different large data sets. This work uses similar a priori knowledge for restricting the form of learning curves as ours (see Section 3), and also similar empirical evaluation criteria for compar-ing curve families with one another. While both ap-plication and performance metric in our work are different, we arrive at a similar conclusion that a power law family of the form y = c  X  a x  X   X  is a good model of the learning curves.

Learning curves are also frequently used for de-termining empirically the number of iterations for an incremental learning procedure.

The crucial difference in our work is that in the previous cases, learning curves are plotted a poste-riori i.e. once the labelled data has become avail-able and the training has been performed, whereas in our work the learning curve itself is the object of the prediction. Our goal is to learn to predict what the learning curve will be a priori without having to label the data at all (S1), or through labelling only a very small amount of it (S2).

In this respect, the academic field of Computa-tional Learning Theory has a similar goal, since it strives to identify bounds to performance measures 1 , typically including a dependency on the training sample size. We take a purely empirical approach in this work, and obtain useful estimations for a case like SMT, where the complexity of the mapping be-tween the input and the output prevents tight theo-retical analysis. The first step in our approach consists in selecting a suitable family of shapes for the learning curves that we want to produce in the two scenarios being considered.

We formulate the problem as follows. For a cer-tain bilingual test dataset d , we consider a set of observations O d = { ( x 1 ,y 1 ) , ( x 2 ,y 2 ) ... ( x n where y i is the performance on d (measured using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002)) of a translation model trained on a parallel corpus of size x i . The corpus size x i is measured in terms of the number of seg-ments (sentences) present in the parallel corpus.
We consider such observations to be generated by a regression model of the form: where F is a function depending on a vector param-eter  X  which depends on d , and i is Gaussian noise of constant variance.

Based on our prior knowledge of the problem, we limit the search for a suitable F to families that satisfies the following conditions-monotonically in-creasing, concave and bounded. The first condition just says that more training data is better. The sec-ond condition expresses a notion of  X  X iminishing returns X , namely that a given amount of additional training data is more advantageous when added to a small rather than to a big amount of initial data. The last condition is related to our use of BLEU  X  which is bounded by 1  X  as a performance mea-sure; It should be noted that some growth patterns which are sometimes proposed, such as a logarith-mic regime of the form y ' a + b log x , are not compatible with this constraint.

We consider six possible families of functions sat-isfying these conditions, which are listed in Table 1. Preliminary experiments indicated that curves from the  X  X ower X  and  X  X xp X  family with only two param-eters underfitted, while those with five or more pa-rameters led to overfitting and solution instability. We decided to only select families with three or four parameters.
 Curve fitting technique Given a set of observa-ily F ( x ;  X  ) from Table 1, we compute a best fit  X   X  where: through use of the Levenberg-Marquardt method (Mor  X  e, 1978) for non-linear regression.
For selecting a learning curve family, and for all other experiments in this paper, we trained a large number of systems on multiple configurations of training sets and sample sizes, and tested each on multiple test sets; these are listed in Table 2. All experiments use Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). 2
The goodness of fit for each of the families is eval-uated based on their ability to i ) fit over the entire set of observations, ii ) extrapolate to points beyond the observed portion of the curve and iii ) generalize well over different datasets .

We use a recursive fitting procedure where the curve obtained from fitting the first i points is used to predict the observations at two points: x i +1 , i.e. the point to the immediate right of the currently ob-served x i and x n , i.e. the largest point that has been observed.

The following error measures quantify the good-ness of fit of the curve families: 1. Average root mean-squared error (RMSE): 2. Average root mean squared residual at next 3. Average root mean squared residual at the last Curve fitting evaluation The evaluation of the goodness of fit for the curve families is presented in Table 3. The average values of the root mean-squared error and the average residuals across all the learning curves used in our experiments are shown in this table. The values are on the same scale as the BLEU scores. Figure 1 shows the curve fits obtained for all the six families on a test dataset for English-German language pair.

Loooking at the values in Table 3, we decided to use the Pow 3 family as the best overall compromise. While it is not systematically better than Exp 4 and Pow 4 , it is good overall and has the advantage of requiring only 3 parameters. In this section we address scenario S1: we have access to a source-language monolingual collec-tion (from which portions to be manually translated could be sampled) and a target-language in-domain monolingual corpus, to supplement the target side of a parallel corpus while training a language model. The only available parallel resource is a very small test corpus. Our objective is to predict the evolution of the BLEU score on the given test set as a function of the size of a random subset of the training data that we manually translate 4 . The intuition behind this is that the source-side and target-side mono-lingual data already convey significant information about the difficulty of the translation task.
We proceed in the following way. We first train models to predict the BLEU score at m anchor sizes s ,...,s m , based on a set of features globally char-acterizing the configuration of interest. We restrict our attention to linear models: where w j is a vector of feature weights specific to predicting at anchor size j , and  X  is a vector of size-independent configuration features, detailed below. We then perform inference using these models to predict the BLEU score at each anchor, for the test case of interest. We finally estimate the parameters of the learning curve by weighted least squares re-gression using the anchor predictions.

Anchor sizes can be chosen rather arbitrarily, but must satisfy the following two constraints: 1. They must be three or more in number in order 2. They should be spread as much as possible For our experiments, we take m = 3 , with anchors at 10K, 75K and 500K segments.

The feature vector  X  consists of the following fea-tures: 1. General properties: number and average length 2. Average length of tokens in the (source) test set 3. Lexical diversity features: 4. Features capturing divergence between lan-5. Word-order divergence: The divergence in the These features capture our intuition that translation is going to be harder if the language in the domain is highly variable and if the source and target lan-guages diverge more in terms of morphology and word-order.

The weights w j are estimated from data. The training data for fitting these linear models is ob-tained in the following way. For each configuration (combination of language pair and domain) c and test set t in Table 2, a gold curve is fitted using the selected tri-parameter power-law family using a fine grid of corpus sizes. This is available as a byproduct of the experiments for comparing different paramet-ric families described in Section 3. We then compute the value of the gold curves at the m anchor sizes: we thus have m  X  X old X  vectors  X  1 ,...,  X  m with ac-curate estimates of BLEU at the anchor sizes 5 . We construct the design matrix  X  with one column for each feature vector  X  ct corresponding to each com-bination of training configuration c and test set t .
We then estimate weights w j using Ridge regres-sion ( L 2 regularization): where the regularization parameter C is chosen by cross-validation. We also run experiments using Lasso ( L 1 ) regularization (Tibshirani, 1994) instead of Ridge. As baseline, we take a constant mean model predicting, for each anchor size s j , the av-erage of all the  X  jct .
 We do not assume the difficulty of predicting BLEU at all anchor points to be the same. To allow for this, we use (non-regularized) weighted least-squares to fit a curve from our parametric family through the m anchor points 6 . Following (Croarkin and Tobias, 2006, Section 4.4.5.2), the anchor con-fidence is set to be the inverse of the cross-validated mean square residuals: where w \ c j are the feature weights obtained by the regression above on all training configurations ex-cept c ,  X  jct is the gold value at anchor j for train-ing/test combination c,t , and N is the total number of such combinations 7 . In other words, we assign to each anchor point a confidence inverse to the cross-validated mean squared error of the model used to predict it.

For a new unseen configuration with feature vec-tor  X  u , we determine the parameters  X  u of the corre-sponding learning curve as: Given a small  X  X eed X  parallel corpus, the translation system can be used to train small in-domain models and the evaluation score can be measured at a few initial sample sizes { ( x 1 ,y 1 ) , ( x 2 ,y 2 ) ... ( x The performance of the system for these initial points provides evidence for predicting its perfor-mance for larger sample sizes.

In order to do so, a learning curve from the fam-ily Pow 3 is first fit through these initial points. We assume that p  X  3 for this operation to be well-defined. The best fit  X   X  is computed using the same curve fitting as in Eq. 2.

At each individual anchor size s j , the accuracy of prediction is measured using the root mean-squared error between the prediction of extrapolated curves and the gold values: where  X   X  ct are the parameters of the curve fit using the initial points for the combination ct .

In general, we observed that the extrapolated curve tends to over-estimate BLEU for large sam-ples. In scenario S2, the models trained from the seed par-allel corpus and the features used for inference (Sec-tion 4) provide complementary information. In this section we combine the two to see if this yields more accurate learning curves.

For the inference method of Section 4, predictions of models at anchor points are weighted by the in-verse of the model empirical squared error (  X  j ). We extend this approach to the extrapolated curves. Let u be a new configuration with seed parallel corpus of size x u , and let x l be the largest point in our grid for which x l  X  x u . We first train translation models and evaluate scores on samples of size x 1 ,...,x l , fit pa-rameters  X   X  u through the scores, and then extrapolate BLEU at the anchors s j : F ( s j ;  X   X  u ) ,j  X  X  1 ,...,m } . Using the models trained for the experiments in Sec-tion 3, we estimate the squared extrapolation error at the anchors s j when using models trained on size up to x l , and set the confidence in the extrapolations 8 for u to its inverse: where N , S , T c and  X  ctj have the same meaning as in Eq. 4, and  X  &lt;l ct are parameters fitted for config-uration c and test t using only scores measured at x ,...,x l . We finally estimate the parameters  X  u of the combined curve as: where  X  u is the feature vector for u , and w j are the weights we obtained from the regression in Eq. 3. In this section, we report the results of our experi-ments on predicting the learning curves. 7.1 Inferred Learning Curves
In the case of inference from mostly monolingual data, the accuracy of the predictions at each of the anchor sizes is evaluated using root mean-squared error over the predictions obtained in a leave-one-out manner over the set of configurations from Ta-ble 2. Table 4 shows these results for Ridge and Lasso regression models at the three anchor sizes. As an example, the model estimated using Lasso for the 75K anchor size exhibits a root mean squared error of 6 BLEU points. The errors we obtain are lower than the error of the baseline consisting in tak-ing, for each anchor size s j , the average of all the  X  ctj . The Lasso regression model selected four fea-tures from the entire feature set: i ) Size of the test set (sentences &amp; tokens) ii ) Perplexity of language model (order 5) on the test set iii ) Type-token ratio of the target monolingual corpus . Feature correla-tion measures such as Pearsons R showed that the features corresponding to type-token ratios of both source and target languages and size of test set have a high correlation with the BLEU scores at the three anchor sizes.

Figure 2 shows an instance of the inferred learn-ing curves obtained using a weighted least squares method on the predictions at the anchor sizes. Ta-ble 7 presents the cumulative error of the inferred learning curves with respect to the gold curves, mea-sured as the average distance between the curves in the range x  X  [0 . 1 K, 100 K ] . 7.2 Extrapolated Learning Curves As explained in Section 5, we evaluate the accuracy of predictions from the extrapolated curve using the root mean squared error (see Eq. 6) between the pre-dictions of this curve and the gold values at the an-chor points.

We conducted experiments for three sets of initial points, 1 ) 1K-5K-10K, 2 ) 5K-10K-20K, and 3 ) 1K-5K-10K-20K. For each of these sets, we show the prediction accuracy at the anchor sizes, 10K 9 , 75K, and 500K in Table 5.

The root mean squared errors obtained by extrap-olating the learning curve are much lower than those obtained by prediction of translation accuracy using the monolingual corpus only (see Table 4), which is expected given that more direct evidence is avail-able in the former case . In Table 5, one can also see that the root mean squared error for the sets 1K-5K-10K and 5K-10K-20K are quite close for anchor sizes 75K and 500K. However, when a configuration of four initial points is used for the same amount of  X  X eed X  parallel data, it outperforms both the config-urations with three initial points. 7.3 Combined Learning Curves and Overall In Section 6, we presented a method for combin-ing the predicted learning curves from inference and extrapolation by using a weighted least squares ap-proach. Table 6 reports the root mean squared error at the three anchor sizes from the combined curves.
We also present an overall evaluation of all the predicted learning curves. The evaluation metric is the average distance between the predicted curves and the gold curves, within the range of sample sizes x min =0.1K to x max =500K segments; this metric is defined as: where  X   X  ct is the curve of interest,  X   X  ct is the gold curve, and x is in the range [ x min ,x max ] , with a step size of 1. Table 7 presents the final evaluation.
We see that the combined curves (CR and CL) perform slightly better than the inferred curves (IR and IL) and the extrapolated curves (EC). The aver-age distance is on the same scale as the BLEU score, which suggests that our best curves can predict the gold curve within 1.5 BLEU points on average (the best result being 0.7 BLEU points when the initial points are 1K-5K-10K-20K) which is a telling re-sult. The distances between the predicted and the gold curves for all the learning curves in our experi-ments are shown in Figure 3.

We also provide a comparison of the different pre-dicted curves with respect to the gold curve as shown in Figure 4.
 The ability to predict the amount of parallel data required to achieve a given level of quality is very valuable in planning business deployments of statis-tical machine translation; yet, we are not aware of any rigorous proposal for addressing this need.
Here, we proposed methods that can be directly applied to predicting learning curves in realistic sce-narios. We identified a suitable parametric fam-ily for modeling learning curves via an extensive empirical comparison. We described an inference method that requires a minimal initial investment in the form of only a small parallel test dataset. For the cases where a slightly larger in-domain  X  X eed X  par-allel corpus is available, we introduced an extrapola-tion method and a combined method yielding high-precision predictions: using models trained on up to 20K sentence pairs we can predict performance on a given test set with a root mean squared error in the order of 1 BLEU point at 75K sentence pairs, and in the order of 2-4 BLEU points at 500K. Consider-ing that variations in the order of 1 BLEU point on a same test dataset can be observed simply due to the instability of the standard MERT parameter tun-ing algorithm (Foster and Kuhn, 2009; Clark et al., 2011), we believe our results to be close to what can be achieved in principle. Note that by using gold curves as labels instead of actual measures we im-plicitly average across many rounds of MERT (14 for each curve), greatly attenuating the impact of the instability in the optimization procedure due to ran-domness.

For enabling this work we trained a multitude of instances of the same phrase-based SMT sys-tem on 30 distinct combinations of language-pair and domain, each with fourteen distinct training sets of increasing size and tested these instances on multiple in-domain datasets, generating 96 learning curves. BLEU measurements for all 96 learning curves along with the gold curves and feature values used for inferring the learning curves are available as additional material to this submission.

We believe that it should be possible to use in-sights from this paper in an active learning setting, to select, from an available monolingual source, a subset of a given size for manual translation, in such a way at to yield the highest performance, and we plan to extend our work in this direction.
