 It has been 3 years since I took over as the editor-in-chief of ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP) . I am pleased to say that I have recently been reappointed as its editor-in-chief for a second term.
During the past 3 years, TALIP has diligently stuck to its target of reviewing and publishing only articles related to Asian language information processing. The number of submissions has grown from 70 submissions in 2008 to 109 submissions in 2009 (inclusive of submissions to special issues), with an accep-tance rate of 15% in 2009, which is one of the most competitive acceptance rates among all ACM journals and transactions. The average time to first decision in 2009 was 70 days, which is a respectable turnaround time.

These achievements are only possible due to the generous support of the authors, reviewers, and associate editors of TALIP. I would like to place on the record my heartfelt appreciation for the outstanding contributions of TALIP X  X  associate editors who served during the past 3 years: Hsin-Hsi Chen, Jianfeng Gao, Kui-Lam Kwok, Gina-Anne Levow, Hang Li, Xiaoqiang Luo, Yuji Matsumoto, Sung-Hyon Myaeng, Jian-Yun Nie, Richard Sproat, Benjamin Tsou, Jun X  X chi Tsujii, Fei Xia, and Ming Zhou.

I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the new incoming associate editors: Yaser Al-Onaizan, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Wen-Lian Hsu, Hitoshi Isahara, Philipp Koehn, Sadao Kurohashi, Wai Lam, Gary Geunbae Lee, Chin-Yew Lin, Qun Liu, Jong C Park, Rajeev Sangal, Tanja Schultz, Chew Lim Tan, Haifeng Wang, Ye-Yi Wang, Chung-Hsien Wu, Nianwen Xue, Guodong Zhou, Imed Zitouni, and Chengqing Zong. I look forward to working with them to make TALIP the publication venue of choice for Asian language information processing.
