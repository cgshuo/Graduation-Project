 If you could freely choose the degree of risk, which would you choose in order to gain a competitive advantage? This open question is applicable to a wide range of fields such as evolutionary biology, sociology, management science, politics, and economics. Roos et al. [2010] conducted a pioneering work on state-dependent risk preferences and showed that a specific risk preference is adaptive, and this fact is consistent with prospect theory. One of their primary insights is that a specific risk strategy is dominant in an imitate-the-better environment, whereas all the strategies are indifferent in a replicator dynamic environment. However, if all the lotteries have the same expected payoff, it is trivial that they are indifferent in the replicator dynamics environment, where the fitness value is defined as the average payoff. This is because the fitness values of all the strategies are equal despite having the freedom to select strategies. Thus, we need to assume an imitate-the-better environment for an essential discussion of dominant risk strategies. The definition of imitate-the-better 1 by Roos et al. [2010] is that  X  X he observer always adopts the strategy of the observed agent X  X  strategy if it was more successful than the observer X  X  strategy. X  A weak strategy (not the most successful one) becomes extinct, and the winner takes all.

According to Roos and Nau [2010], there is some empirical evidence that this lim-itation strategy (imitate-the-better) is a good model of human social learning 2 . They (and we) assume risk choice behavior in the imitate-the-better environment, in which many risk strategies compete, and successful ones take all. What implications does this assumption have? Although the first example might seem somewhat naive, it captures the essence of our target very well. Imagine two young men who are vying for a poten-tial mate in prehistoric times. They are puzzled about whether to take a risk and go hunting mammoth or to play it safe and go nutting, that is, gathering nuts. If one chose hunting, he might get a lot of food but also might be severely injured. Nutting is a safe and certain way to get food, although in smaller quantities. If a young man with a lot of food can attract a mate, the situation is regarded as a winner-take-all environment in a two-player game. The next example is perhaps a more realistic illustration. Imagine a doctoral candidate who is going to select a research theme, and let there be two themes: a challenging one and an inconsequential one. If the challenging theme is successful, the positive outcome might work advantageously in job hunting. Otherwise, a failure would give the candidate nothing. With the inconsequential theme, the candidates can certainly write a dissertation, but the paper will have little impact. Several years later, if two researchers are competing for a position, the risk strategies they used in selecting a research theme might be an important determinant in deciding who gets the position.

There is a wide range of fields that can be used to test features of risk choice strate-gies. The pioneering work by Roos et al. [2010] is the first step in researching risk behavior in an evolutionary context, and can be regarded as providing an important theoretical framework that complements some existing academic insights. We under-stand that it is important to generalize the model of Roos et al. [2010] because they focused only on the 2-choice game. Due to this restriction, their discovery should be applied to more generalized situations. We propose here a framework that can describe risk strategy in a richer way than that of Roos et al., and we derive some features of risk choice strategy using mathematical analysis and numerical simulations. These features indicate, for example, that the degree of risk of adaptive behavior is relatively high but not the highest possible, and that all the strategies can be divided into two groups: a small number of persistent strategies and a large majority of extinct ones.
It should be widely observed that most risk strategies have become extinct in human society, which is the key feature of the risk choice game. This is because human society is in an environment in which people are always competing, and thus, people have acquired this feature as an evolutionary pattern of adaptive human behavior. For example, it is well-known that chess players consider a very limited number of moves instead of contemplating all the possibilities from the beginning when playing chess. If the space of chess moves can be correlated a risk strategy space, we may be able to infer from this study that people only tend to consider very specific strategies. Moreover, this implication may derive a more generalized one such that many kinds of specialists pass over many alternatives without a thought.

Our study takes a more utilitarian approach, and therefore, can explain the human behavioral principle. This is a different approach from prospect theory, which tries to explain things by taking a psychological approach. You may understand this difference when the following statements are shown as an example. Why do businesspersons who have often stressed the importance of taking risks in business tend to avoid taking risks when they have succeeded in business and gotten older? The retention effect developed in prospect theory can explain this as the human tendency to hate losing goods that one has already gained. In contrast, our approach may reveal that one behaves in such a way because the action is beneficial for that person.

In Section 2, we review studies on risk choice and position our study in the context of risk choice. In Section 3, we properly define the risk choice game. We present a mathematical analysis of the game with up to two-choices game in Section 4. In Section 5, we apply replicator dynamics and prove some theories of the dynamics in order to analyze the performance of a 3-choice or more game. Several numerical simulations on those dynamics are run in Section 6. Finally, we conclude the article in Section 7. Many empirical studies on risk behavior deal with the existence of risk behavior and its traits by taking an experimental or questionnaire approach. As a result, the emphasis is on human irrationality. Many theories have been developed based on this approach, for example, prospect theory [Kahneman and Tversky 1979], regret theory [Savage 1951; Loomes and Sugden 1982; Zeelenberg et al. 1996], and theories dealing with concepts such as aspiration level [Siegel 1957; Lopes and Oden 1999; Payne 2005] and the effect of free products on consumers [Shampanier et al. 2007]. Recently, much research has been done on risky behaviors that explore the issue from different perspectives; for example, some studies have investigated genetic factors [Bell 2009; Cesarini et al. 2009; Zhong et al. 2008], gender differences [Charness and Gneezy 2007], and hummingbirds and starlings [Bateson 2002]. One of the primary contributions of these studies is the observation of empirical facts and the explanation of psychological features.
Much effort has been made in the field of economics, especially microeconomics, to add some parameters for utility functions for making decisions under risk [Epstein and Zin 1989; Diecidue and Ven 2008; Skaperdas 1991; 1992]. Rabin [2000] tried to explain risk behavior using a utility function in which fairness was included. Oyarzun and Sarin [2011] characterized learning rules that respond to risk in some intuitive, economic ways. Engelmann and Steiner [2007] analyzed the effects of risk preferences in mixed strategy equilibria of 2 by 2 games. These studies have attempted to focus on the consistency between risk behavior and the existing theories.

Karni and Schmeidler [1986] is one of the pioneering works on the foundation of rational behavior under risk in a winner-take-all environment, which can be applied in many fields, for example, the competition for mates among lekking birds [Stern 2010]. Studies on risk behaviors in winner-take-all environments have taken many approaches. Dekel [1999] investigated to what extent evolution leads to risk-taking in winner-take-all environments using an evolutionary model of preference formation and a concept of first-and second-order stochastic dominance 3 . Using game-theoretical analysis, Robson [1996] showed that males will choose very risky lotteries if they choose lotteries over wealth in order to maximize offspring and are selected by females according to their relative wealth. This is also one of the analyses in a winner-take-all environment. Sounderpandian [2007] used a simulation in order to analyze risk attitudes. Stern [2010] used a stochastic simulation of selection and modeled only sym-metric competition in which the reproduction of all individuals is equally suppressed by the overall population size. They investigated whether long-shot risk taking is favored in the extreme case of winner-take-all competition 4 .

Roos et al. [2010] adopted an evolutionary game theory approach [Smith and Price 1973] in which there is explicit competition between individuals. This approach does not assume either a perfect rationality or a perfect forecast, and thus it expresses human adaptive behavior very well. Therefore, it can provide some useful insights on not only biology but also on many fields that deal with various human behaviors. They showed that a specific strategy, referred to as the R w S strategy in their paper, is dominant and evolutionarily stable in a 2-choice game in an imitate-the-better environment. This re-sult is consistent with prospect theory. Although they investigated a specific dominant strategy in a specific situation, they cannot describe the more generalized framework to test the dominance of risk strategy (this is often seen with any pioneering work).
As mentioned in the Introduction, we have extended Roos X  X  work in an imitate-the-better environment, which is equivalent to a winner-take-all environment. Due to this extension, we need two constraints. One, any lottery with a different risk has the same von Neumann and Morgenstern expected utility [von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944]. We agree that this is an oversimplification because there exist many types of expected utilities in the real world. However, this constraint has an extreme effect on analyzing risk strategy because we can explain the mechanism of adaptive behavior by the risk strategy only, and thus, this is academically fine 5 .

The second constraint is to adopt a replicator dynamic analysis with an average winning probability as a fitness value. The meaning of winning, here, is that the actual payoff from playing the game by using the certain risk strategy exceeds the other X  X  payoff. Note that our approach differs from Roos X  X  study because they used a payoff itself as a fitness value. As mentioned in the Introduction, if we adopt an expected payoff as a fitness, it is trivial if the fitness values of all the strategies are the same and thus indifferent in the replicator dynamics, because we deal with a strategy with the same expected utility only 6 . The following two points explain the intuition of this constraint. First, in an imitate-the-better environment with two players and random matching, the average winning probability of the risk strategy means the strength of the strategy. Second, a fitness value based on victory or defeat of the final payoffs is more desirable than that based on the final payoffs themselves because a payoff as a result of a strategy is not the success of a strategy itself. For example, the prehistoric hunters mentioned earlier compete to get their mates, and that is the final goal for them while they face the choice of whether to go hunting or nutting. The doctoral candidates also face the issue of which theme they should choose when their final goal is job hunting. Before formulating a risk choice game, we explain the interpretation of the game using a fictitious game. Let two players play in an abstract poker game. There are many safe cards (S) and many risk cards (R) in the pile. The backs of the cards say either 0, 1, or  X  1, and these are referred to as the card values. The value of the safe card is certainly 0, and that of the risk card is either 1 or  X  1 with probability 0 . 5. First, each player draws one card from the pile where the players know which type (S or R) they will choose, but their opponent does not know. The player can see the back of the drawn card and know its value immediately, but is forbidden to let the opponent know the value. Next, the player draws the second card sequentially. Thus, the term sequentiality means that cards are represented as dots on the time axis, and a player can see the values of the cards that are played before choosing the next card. Therefore, one can plan a strategy for an action in the next card taking these results into account. This play is repeated n times. After that, the total value of n cards each player drew is calculated and revealed, and the player with the higher value is the winner. For simplicity, if the total values of two players are the same, the winner is determined another way (of course, the winning probability of each player is 0 . 5), and a tie game, or draw, is not permitted.

The abstract poker game used here as an example reflects the basic characteristics of a game we would like to use. This is because a card is selected sequentially; a player chooses the type of card (S or R) to draw; one person can see all her/his choices and outcomes; on the contrary, the other person does not know any information about the opponent X  X  choices and outcomes; and the victory or defeat is determined at the end. Generally, introducing sequentiality is the standard method in game theory. However, if a player of our game does not make a decision sequentially, that is to say, one does not know the values of the drawn card by the end of the game, the winning probabilities of all the strategies are the same, as proved later. This fact supports the premise that sequentiality is a necessary condition with dominant risk choice strategies.
We are ready to describe a basic model. Hereafter, we use the term 0 lottery and 1 lottery instead of safe card (S) and risk card (R), respectively. Thus, 0 lottery means getting zero (doing nothing) with certainty (with probability one), and 1 lottery means getting 1 with probability 0 . 5 and losing 1 (getting  X  1) with probability 0 . 5. We intro-duce some notations in order to describe these definitions properly. First, we define an player gains x i with probability p i . Of course, 0  X  p i  X  1and i p i = 1 satisfy. Rev-for example, an expectation vector of a game consisting of one 1 lottery is denoted by (  X  1 , 0 . 5; 1 , 0 . 5).

We deal with a game where every player sequentially chooses n times of lotteries. We call this an n -choice game. A lottery chosen for the i -th turn lottery is noted as  X  i .Any lottery corresponds to a bit description whether  X  i is 0 or 1, because  X  i = 0(or 1) means a player chooses a safe (or risk) lottery for the i -th turn. Further, let h n be the value a player gains as a result of the n -thturnlottery,and H n = ( h 1 h 2 ... h n ) be the history of lottery results. For example, if a player chooses 0 lottery for the first turn and 1 lottery for the second turn (let the result of this lottery be  X  1), and then 0 lottery for the third turn in a 3-choice game, then, H 3 = (0  X  10).

Finally, we describe a strategy. Every player uses the history H n when choosing the n + 1-th turn lottery. This is why a player changes the next lottery depending on the results of the previous lotteries. For example, it is possible that  X  3 = 0if H 2 = (0  X  1) and  X  3 = 1if H 2 = (0 1). The description of the strategy for the i -th turn requires 2  X  1 bits. For example, let a strategy for 3-rd turn,  X   X  then  X  3 = b 7 , where b i ={ 0 , 1 } and b i = 1(or 0) means that a 1(or 0) lottery was strategy as a string connecting all the strategies from the first-turn lottery to the last turn. Therefore, the strategy of a 3-choice game, for example, is described as b 1 b 2 ... b 7 , where b 1 is the stategy for the 1-st turn, b 2 and b 3 are those for the 2-nd turn, and b 4 to b 7 are those for the 3-rd turn. Figure 1 helps to illustrate this explanation 7 .When a player chooses 0 lottery at a certain turn lottery, this turn has no victory or defeat (because one gains zero with probability one); therefore, the strategy describes the case of victory only, and the case of defeat is noted as  X  . Further, when  X  in the strategy description is replaced with 0, all the strategy descriptions correspond to bit strings. With this notation, the description of strategy is defined properly, and a strategy of an n -choice game is described as a 2 n  X  1 bit string. We regard these as binaries and call a strategy number that is changed to such a binary a decimal. Moreover, a strategy with a strategy number i is called a strategy s i . In particular, we use s n i when we would liketogiveweighttothe n -choice game. All the strategy numbers in the n -choice game are in the range of 0 to 2 2 n  X  1  X  1. The strategies in the 2-choice game are confirmed as indicated in Table I.
 The following theorem is easily derived.

T HEOREM 3.1. The number of strategies in the n-choice game, k n , satisfies the following recurring formula. strategies with  X  n + 1 1 = 0andthosewith  X  n + 1 1 = 1. The former strategies can correspond the number of former strategies is k n . The latter ones can be defined as a combination of one of the strategies in h 1  X  X  0 , 1 } and one of them in h 1 = X  1. Both also correspond to all the strategies in the n -choice game one-on-one. Therefore, the total number of latter strategies is k n 2 .

A sequence { k n } is always greater than a sequence b 1 = 2 , b n + 1 = b n 2 when n &gt; 1, and so k n  X  2 2 n  X  1 . This means sequence { k n } increases at a faster pace than any exponential function. Victory or defeat of the n -choice game defined before depends on the difference in players X  final payoffs. The winning probability in the case where two strategies are be the expectation vectors of strategies s i and s j . The winning probability of s i over s j is calculated using v i and v j . Further, if the achieved payoffs of these two strategies have the same value, let either player win with probability 0 . 5, and a draw is never permitted. Here, a ij is defined as the value of the winning probability of s i over s j minus 0 . 5 in order to analyze n -choice games easily. Therefore 8 ,
We define an interaction matrix A consisting of a ij . Due to this unique definition, a is an antisymmetric matrix. As an aside, a game in which the adaptation matrix is antisymmetric is generally called a zero sum game [Brown and von Neumann 1950].
We define the superiority of a strategy by using matrix A .If a ij &gt; 0, then strategy s is dominant over strategy s j , and we note s i s j . Of course, a ji &lt; 0 is satisfied, and strategy s j is recessive to strategy s i .If a ij = 0, then s i is equal to s j and we note s i  X  s j . This new notation does not necessarily satisfy a transitive law; namely, s i s k is not assured even if s i s j and s j s k . For example, in the 3-choice game, a
Moreover, a set of strategies s i that is dominant is denoted as P ( s i )~Ca set of strate-P , I ,and U are mutually exclusive 10 ,and P  X  I  X  U = K n is always satisfied for a set of all the strategies in the n -choice game, K n . For example, in a 2-choice game, P ( s 5 ) ={ s 0 , s 6 , s 7 } , I ( s 5 ) ={ s 2 , s 4 , s 5 } ,and U ( s 5 ) = X  11 . Here, we can derive the first primal feature as the following theorem.

T HEOREM 4.1. Any two strategies without sequentiality, s i and s j are denoted as s i  X  s . Here, the term  X  X ithout sequentiality X  means that a chosen lottery for any k-th turn lottery,  X  k is constant irrespective of any history, H k  X  1 in the n-choice game. 12
P ROOF . Any strategy without sequentiality does not depend on a history, and there is an equal chance that a player will choose n lotteries simultaneously. This is why the strategy is described as choosing a 1 lottery for k turns and a 0 lottery for n  X  k turns where 0  X  k  X  n . This is called a strategy k . The expectation vector of a strategy k is (  X  probability of any strategy i over any strategy j is always 0 . 5, and therefore a ij = 0. choice game 13 . The most important implication of this theorem is that to apply sequen-tiality is a source of existing superior (dominant) risk strategies in the winner-takes-all environment. Based on the analysis of the 2-choice game, strategy s 5 is superior, namely because it is either dominant or equal to all the strategies explained earlier. As is clear, s is not always indifferent because s 5 has a  X  X ith sequentiality X  feature. On the other sequentiality X  feature.

The analysis of the 2-choice game clarified that a certain risk strategy, s 2 5 , is domi-nant 14 . As is clear from Figure 2, the features of this type of strategy are that: (1) it chooses a risky lottery (1 lottery) for the first turn, (2) if it succeeds, then it chooses a safe lottery (0 lottery) for the second, and (3) otherwise, it chooses a risk again. The fact of this strategy X  X  superiority is a basic principle. We verified that these features have almost the same traits, such as a risk-averse effect [Kahneman and Tversky 1979] and the retention effect [Kahneman and Tversky 2000] 15 . This is why these features are consistent with the prospect theory. This insight is one of the most important features of risk choice strategies.
 To discuss this superiority formally, we properly define the following concepts. be We then verify the following basic principles.
 strategy
The preceding two lemmas are trivial. We then prove the last lemma. It is also trivial in the case of a 1-choice game because there are only two strategies. We have already shown the case of a 2-choice game. Analyzing 3-choice or more games requires computer calculation because the numbers of strategies k 3 , k 4 ,and k 5 are 42, 1806, and 3 , game has a strategy s where s  X  s . This is why PN 3 = PD 3 = X  . We can prove the cases of 4-and 5-choice games as well, but they are omitted here.

This article does not analyze 6-choice or more games (and therefore, this will be a future extension of this study), but we expect that there is neither perfect neutral nor perfect dominant strategies in those games. As is clear from the previous analyses, s 2 5 (qPD in the 2-choice game) is a rare case. Although it is undeniable that the discovery of s 2 5 brings an important feature to a risk choice strategy, it is not sufficient to apply more generalized risk choice situations because the 2-choice game is oversimplified. Therefore, we need another approach to analyze 3-choice or more games. As mentioned in the previous section, the 3-choice or more games demand another approach. We then try dynamic analyses of the interactions between strategies. Evo-lutionarily speaking, which strategy (with its different degree of risk) is chosen is regarded as a kind of evolutionary game in which the fruits of victory are applied as a measure of fitness. We then analyze a replicator dynamics equation [Shuster and Sig-mund 1983]. The analysis originates from biology. Multiple strategies are regarded as  X  X iving X  in a group, where each member fights with each other in proportion to the ex-isting ratio. As a result of fighting, the existing ratio of each member is increased by the probability pf winning per unit, and thus, all the existing ratios of the next generation are determined. As reviewed in Section 2, there are many studies on human behavior that are applying this approach. It can also be used to treat many strategies simul-taneously, and we can discuss the dominance of strategies by observing transitions in their population ratios.
 We use the interaction matrix A and the fitness value as the winning probability. Let x i be an existing ratio of strategy s i in the population. Of course, population x = ( x x &gt; 0 for any i ,then x is internal and x is limitrophe otherwise. The replicator dynamics equation is noted as  X  x i = x i (( Ax ) i  X  x  X  Ax )and x  X  Ax = 0when A is antisymmetric. Therefore, the equation becomes a linear differential equation, and x can be solved by x ( t ) = exp( At ) x (0) [Arnold 1973].

We devise a strategic plan before analyzing the replicator dynamics equation. Some strategies have the same expectation vectors. For example, both s 2 2 and s 2 4 have the same, then they have the same winning probabilities for all the strategies, and thus, the components of the interaction matrix have the same values. We then collect the strategies with the same expectation vectors as one strategy.
 To specify the strategy clearly, we define a strategic equivalency as follows.
Definition 5.1 ( Strategic Equivalency ). If strategies s i and s j have the same expec-tation vectors, then they are described as s i  X  v s j .

These strategies have the same components as any other strategy in the interaction matrix, and so their performance is always the same. Moreover, the multiple same-row vectors make matrix A a degenerate matrix, and it is difficult to analyze the dynamics. We then adopt a representative strategy rule defined as follows.
 lency, a strategy that does not have the smallest strategy number among strategic equivalencies is removed.

Using the representative strategy rule, we can define a unique strategy set R n ,which isasubsetof K n (a set of all the strategies in the n -choice game), as
We explain with an example of the 2-choice game as shown in Table I. s 2  X  v s 4 is satisfied, and thus, s 4 is removed using the representative strategy rule. Therefore, we sections of replicator analysis and numerical simulations, we use a strategy space as R n instead of K n , which refers to all the strategies in the n -choice game.
We are now ready to analyze the replicator dynamics equation. Finally, we define an important concept for which a strategy persists.
 i f i ( x ) x i be an average fitness for population x . For any population p in the unique strategy space R n , it is defined as a saturated equilibrium point if p i &gt; 0 a positive existing ratio at a saturated equilibrium point, it is defined as persistence. The number of persistent strategies is noted as ps n .

It is certified that the persistent strategies are not extinct species. However, as is clear from the definition, the existing ratios of strategies without persistence (nonpersistent strategies) are close to 0 without limit after adequate time, and therefore, we can regard them as extinct species. The extinct strategies are certainly not adaptive, and thus, we can eliminate them from the objectives for analysis.

Here, we consider the relationship to define perfect dominant, quasi-perfect domi-nant, and perfect neutral strategies. If a perfect dominant strategy exists, it is composed of persistence, and thus, the remainders are extinct. If a quasi-perfect dominance exists, it is composed of persistent and perfect neutral strategies and thus, the remainders are extinct, also. However, (it is expected that) such a strategy does not exist in 3-choice or more games. By the way, the existence of persistence means that some strategies that are composed of persistence eradicate the others, and therefore, it is a similar concept to the extension of perfect dominance. Actually, as proved later, the persistencies cer-tainly exist in 3-choice or more games, and so it is suggested that a risk choice strategy has a salient feature whether it is persistent or not.

We then analyze a replicator dynamic. According to Hofbauer and Sigmund [1998], if an interaction matrix A is nondegenerate and antisymmetric, the persistence set is determined uniquely, and Chawanya and Tokita [2002] developed a proof in which the number of ps n was odd. Moreover, all the eigenvalues of any antisymmetric matrices are purely imaginary, and therefore, the equilibrium point is a vortex point and the system has neutral stability. (This point is Lyapunov stable but is not a vacuum [Arnold 1973].) This fact means that the existing ratios of all the strategies except for the persistence strategies are close to zero without limit, and the existing ratios of the persistence strategies continue to fluctuate, and then the populations cycle.

We consider some intuitions for this result. First, for any n -choice game, persistence exists, and thus, it is clear that all of the strategies are divided into persistent strategies or other strategies. Exploring the traits of persistence may provide some useful insights on dominant risk strategies from the viewpoint of utilitarianism. The second intuition is that the dynamics are neutral stable. Any population (except on a stable point) becomes a persistence-only population (all the nonpersistent strategies are extinct), but the existing ratios of persistence move cyclically, and they never reach a stable point. There is a group of strategies composed only to persistence in every 3-choice or more game. Each strategy in the group has strategies that are both dominant and recessive to it, and thus, the existing ratio changes cyclically. This is why the persistent strategies partake in three-way struggles such as the rock-scissors-paper game.
Here is another model. Needless to say, a decision maker is allowed to choose one X  X  strategy freely. This can be described as a mutation process. We consider a case where a certain amount of the population becomes mutants through mutation. For simplicity, mutants emerge at the individual level (not a gene, but a strategy itself) and the probability of which strategy will become mutant is equal. Under this assumption, the basic replicator dynamics equation becomes a perturbation system and is changed as where n is the number of strategies and each strategy increases the quantity of as a mutant in any period, and therefore, each should decrease the quantity of n x i in order to replace the mutants 17 .
 We prove the following theorem about the dynamics of the preceding equation.
T HEOREM 5.4. The preceding equation has a unique global asymptotic stabilizing point.

P ROOF . Using an equilibrium point p , we can compose the Lyapunov function L p ( x ) = i p i log x i . This is because Using n p i  X  . Moreover, the equilibrium point is internal, so p i &gt; 0 for any i and then f ( p ) = n  X  p
Using the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, we obtain where the equal sign is correct only if x = p .
This theorem means that the population is close to p without limit after adequate time for any initial population x . That is to say, the dynamic saturates the internal unique equilibrium point and stabilizes in a perturbation system in which an imper-ceptible portion of the population mutates randomly at the individual level. Moreover, if = 0 then the equilibrium point changes and becomes limitrophe, and therefore, the Lyapunov function does not decrease monotonically because we cannot explicate the previous proof for any i where p i = 0. Therefore, the nonperturbation system is neutral stable, which does not saturate the performance even though it has a unique set of persistent strategies.

We consider some intuitions of the perturbation system. An environment with mu-tation in risk choice is regarded as a situation in which a small number of players always chooses their strategy randomly in spite of the existing ratios of the population. Although a replicator dynamics analysis is definitely an outstanding approach that uses a biology analogy, and a model in which the higher the winning probability is, the more the existing ratio increases will exclusively reproduce an imitate-the-better policy, many real risk strategies do not necessarily make such a strong assumption. This is why it is also important to analyze a model that permits new entries by mutant strategies.
 The existence of the unique global asymptotic stabilizing point is an essential feature. When a natural selection process works in a certain environment, there exists a stable existing ratio of strategies of persistence only, and any initial population will eventually be able to reach the stable point. This insight suggests that a specific pattern of risk strategy in nature is often observed. This may provide a new theoretical hypothesis for behavioral economics. However, as well as the discussion about the nonperturbation system, this theorem is just an existence proof, and thus, we cannot discuss the risk strategy in greater detail anymore. In order to determine which strategy is dominant, we have to wait until the next session of numerical simulations is carried out. In the previous section, we showed the dynamics of two systems. In the nonperturbation system, there is a unique set of persistent strategies, and a unique equilibrium point is a vortex point. Thus, the population consisting of the persistent strategies only encircles the vortex point if the initial population does not correspond to the equilibrium point. On the contrary, in the perturbation system, any initial population saturates the unique internal population. However, these facts are just existence proofs. One of our concerns is which type of strategy becomes persistent. To analyze this, we first need to conduct numerical simulations. We then analyze the strategy by converting the replicator dynamics equation to the following difference equations: and
We run a numerical simulation of the 3-choice game under the parameter settings as indicated in Table II (the Appendix shows the interaction matrix).

Figures 3 and 4 show the time series of the nonperturbation and perturbation sys-tems, respectively. As is proven before, the cycle is observed in Figure 3, the performance saturates an equilibrium point in Figure 4, and the performance does not change with the time series when the initial population corresponds to the vortex point. Table III summarizes the persistent strategies.

Finally, we verified the performance of the 4-choice and 5-choice games through numerical simulation; Table IV summarizes them.

Table III clearly indicates that there are five persistent strategies in the 3-choice game. As shown in Figure 5, these strategies, along with the quasi-perfect dominant strategy of the 2-choice game, have salient features in which they choose a risk lottery in the early turn, and victory results in actions that are more conservative than they are in defeat. This observation derives some salient insights. First, the greater the number of choices there are, the faster the number of all strategies K n increases; however, the number of the unique strategy set R n does not increase with such speed. It is striking that the number of persistent strategies seldom increases. In the 3-choice game, for example, 5 out of 22 strategies in the representative strategy space are persistent (when the strategy space is expanded to k 3 , it is 8 of 42 strategies 18 . In the 4-choice game, only seven strategies among 254 are persistent. As is clear from Theorem 4.1, the persistent strategies have a  X  X ith sequentiality X  feature and are therefore state dependent.

It is a very important trait that there is no strategy which is strong (persistent) as a solo strategy in games with three or more choices (at least up to a 5-choice game). The existence of persistent strategies can be proven analytically, but it can be only proven through numerical simulations when the number of strategies is more than one. This implies that no almighty strategy exists. A player must consider the dynamics of the population with several strategies or balance among them.

Almost all the risk strategies are extinct species, and therefore, we can suggest that such a rarity of dominant risk choice strategies is widely observed in many social contexts. From the context of an adaptive process, it can be ascertained that various subjects, including people, know empirically that certain specific strategies are appro-priate. For example, it is often observed that a man who took a risk and succeeded in his youth might tend to become more conservative as he got older. A firm that overcame competition from rivals by taking a big risk would be stability oriented. These exam-ples can be seen in many social systems. Our insight cannot support such phenomena completely, but they help to understand the mechanism we obtained.

It is also interesting that the existing ratios of persistent strategies on the saturated point depend on the existence or nonexistence of mutation. While s 89 has the second highest existing ratios without mutation, it falls into last place, and s 83 becomes the second highest with mutation. It supports the idea that politics of persistence depends on the quantity of mutation. The higher the mutation ratio is, the more conservatively the risk strategy tends to extend power. Further, s 83 is the strategy with the smallest pretation is that there are two types of persistent risk strategies. In an environment with a lot of mutation, a risk strategy that involves feeding many types of minnows (nonpersistent species), including mutants, will push them into extinction. Finally, a  X  X ax X  of a few strategies is established. The social order may let the players know that the mutants do not gain a profit. Then, let the social situation change to the second stage that is without mutation. The politics among winners change, and strategies that are relatively high risk become more advantageous. We might apply this inter-pretation to marketing, for example. When a new market develops, many new entries will enter the market easily, but most will become extinct. The first champion is one that excels over most of the others. Finally, the market stabilizes, and the barrier to enter it becomes higher, and therefore, there are no new entries (no mutations). This fact changes the hegemony of strategies to risk ones. Therefore, this insight might explain the principle of changes in power relationships in the market, but a thorough discussion of it is beyond the scope of this article.

It may be interesting to note, for example, that strategy s 80 is not persistent even though it has similar features to persistence, and strategy s 89 is persistent even though it does not have the features of persistence. The analysis of the 2-choice game only cannot clarify this point, and therefore, a rich discussion is needed when we want to identify the features of dominant strategies.

It goes without saying that we need more arguments in order to apply real situa-tions for risk choice. However, as is clear from the preceding discussion, our insights can provide new theoretical hypotheses in various academic fields such as behavioral economics. We proposed a framework of a game of risk choice strategy in order to generalize Roos X  X  study, extended it to an n -choice game (where Roos et al. [2010] treated a 2-choice game only), and thoroughly analyzed it at least up to four choices game. As a result, we clarified that the system has persistent, which consists of multiple strategies (and which does not have to be clarified by analyzing up to 2-choice games), and that a unique global asymptotic stabilizing point exists in the perturbation. Of course, real risk choice consists of various types, and is sometimes described as a many-choice game. Furthermore, we would have to extend the kinds of lotteries from types 0 and 1 only. However, our study can propose an extendable framework on such complex risk choice strategies and and analyze it fundamentally. A fine extension of our article will help us to develop some salient new theoretical hypotheses due to the provision of complementary discussions on real situations of risk choice as, mentioned in our survey in Section 2.

First, we formulated a risk game using an abstract poker game. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations on a 3-choice or more game were possible by defining an interaction matrix that consists of a winning probability of a strategy. Next, we derived a dominant strategy in a 2-choice game based on that of Roos et al. [2010]. In order to clarify that this dominant strategy is unique (there is no dominance in a 3-choice or more game), we defined some features of strategies as being perfect dominant, quasi-perfect dominant, and perfect neutral and showed the nonexistence of these strategies in 3-to 5-choice games analytically. Then we carried out replicator dynamics analysis. As a result, we showed that all the risk strategies can be divided into two groups: persistence and nonpersistence. We verified that in the dynamics without perturbation (where there is no new entry strategy by any invading mutant), some of the strategies survive while the remainders go extinct. Further, the equilibrium point is just neutral stable and is not a vacuum, and so the population of the surviving persistent strategies encircles the vortex point. We also proved that the dynamics with perturbation in which a mutation is installed is globally asymptotically stable to a unique equilibrium point for any initial population. A discussion of the features of strategies that are divided into the categories of persistent or not would make a very interesting future study. Finally, we conducted numerical simulations to specifically solve the persistence issue. As a result, we identified the persistent strategies in games with up to five choices. As a result, we specified which strategies are persistent. These results may provide some new theoretical hypotheses in many academic fields such as behavioral economics. This article proposes one of the standard approaches for developing the discipline of risk choice behavior.

This article has various restrictions. First, we proposed here a model that limits the scenario to a two-player game, but our framework proposed here is easily extendable to a game of n players. If the number of players is extended, a wider variety of ob-jectives could be applied. For example, university entrance exam systems or tests for employment are regarded as a kind of a game in which m winners are selected from n candidates. A method (strategy) of studying for an exam has many alternatives, and these can be described as various types of risk games. Consumers X  purchasing behav-ior is regarded as a kind of selection of items from many rival goods. The goods are presented to consumers after being selected from various alternative products, which can be described as kind of risk game, in every phase of the 4Ps in marketing: product R &amp; D, price strategy, promotion activity, and placement. These topics will be included in the scope of our article.

Second, we deal with two types of lotteries: 0 and 1. Using a nonnegative real number,  X  , we generalize this as an  X  lottery game and can treat many types of degree of risk 19 . Third, we use a restrictive situation in that a player does not know the opponent X  X  halfway payoff (or as a different take, the opponent will be determined after choosing all the lotteries), but knows the transition of one X  X  payoffs. This is also extendable, and our analysis is just the first step. These restrictions are needed for clarifying our focus, and therefore, the framework we proposed makes it possible to include these extensions.

We plan to do some mathematical homework on 6-choice or more games. We have not yet proved problems in which a set of perfect neutral strategies is empty for n &gt; 5and a set of perfect dominant strategies is always empty for any n . Moreover, although we determined the number of all strategies in the n -choice game, k n , by using a recurrence equation, we have not yet solved analytically the number of strategies by using the representative strategy rule, r n and the number of persistent strategies ps n .
Further, we think one of the solution approaches may be obtained by focusing on the fact that applying sequentiality is not essential for analyzing the model. As is commonly understood, strategies with the same expectation vectors perform the same. Therefore, we have to investigate which vector is the most suitable expectation vector. To find a persistence strategy, we may adopt an approach to analyzing a one-shot risk game, which follows a probability density function that has a payoff with an expected value of zero. Of course, it will be necessary to understand the implications of and to analyze the relationship between the expectation vectors that we solve to determine which strategy has the appropriate vector.

Our model might be compared with the prisoner X  X  dilemma model because both mod-els have an extremely high degree of abstractness and therefore have many applicable fields. We dealt with risk choice behavior as a highly abstract model and discussed several basic ideas for applying the model in this article. This model is expected to be applicable not only in the field of behavioral economics but also in ecology, sociology, consumer behavioral theory, and a wide range of other areas in the future.
 For help in understanding the simulation in Section 6, we show the interaction matrix of R 3 in Table V.
