 Obtaining geographically tagged multimedia items from so-cial Web platforms such as Flickr is beneficial for a variety of applications including the automatic creation of travelogues and personalized travel recommendations. In order to take advantage of the large number of photos and videos that do not contain (GPS-based) latitude/longitude coordinates, a number of approaches have been proposed to estimate the geographic location where they were taken. Such location estimation methods rely on existing geotagged multimedia items as training data. Across application and usage sce-narios, it is commonly assumed that the available geotagged items contain (reasonably) accurate latitude/longitude coor-dinates. Here, we consider this assumption and investigate how accurate the provided location data is. We conduct a study of Flickr images and videos and find that the accu-racy of the geotag information is highly dependent on the popularity of the location: images/videos taken at popular (unpopular) locations, are likely to be geotagged with a high (low) degree of accuracy with respect to the ground truth.

Obtaining geographically tagged multimedia items (i.e. items with latitude/longitude information) such as images and videos from social Web platforms such as Flickr 1 is ben-eficial for a variety of applications including the automatic illustration of travelogues [6], personalized travel recommen-dations [1, 2] and the organization of personal multimedia archives.

Approaches proposed to solve the task of placing images on the world map by determining their latitude and longi-tude, have been relying on a variety of sources that are based on the image and its meta-data, the user uploading the im-age or external knowledge bases. Textual features exploited from the image are mostly the assigned tags and the title as well as the description. Visual features derived from the im-ages include a variety of types, such as color histograms or edge histograms [7] (for videos, keyframes are first extracted and then treated as images).

Serdyukov et al. [9] phrased the problem as an information retrieval task, where world regions are considered as docu-ments and the textual meta-data of an image to be placed on the world map is considered as query. Specifically, the tags assigned to images on Flickr are exploited as query terms. A grid is placed over the world map which results in equally sized cells. Each training image (with known location) is assigned to its correct grid cell. For each cell, a language model [13] is created from the tags assigned by the user, and a test image is assigned to the geographic cell that pro-duces the highest probability for generating the image X  X  tag set. To determine whether a tag is geographic in nature, GeoNames 4 is employed, a large gazetteer of geographic en-tities.

Also based on tags is the approach proposed in [11]. In contrast to [9], the location estimation is performed on differ-ent levels of granularity (city granularity, street level gran-ularity, etc.) and the evidence obtained over the different granularities is combined in order to output the best match granularity location estimate.

The text-based approach by Hauff et al. [4] combines the advantages of the previous two works by considering infor-mation from the training data only (i.e. no external data sources are used): dynamically shaped region sizes are uti-lized and terms are filtered based on their geographic scope which is derived from the training data. It could be shown that by employing such geo-filtering , the placing accuracy can be increased substantially.

Finally, an approach that not only exploits textual infor-mation but also visual features was proposed in [5]. Here, textual information (tags) is the primary source of infor-mation, and visual features are used as fall-back option in instances where tags do not provide meaningful information.
The accuracy of estimating the geographic location of im-ages is commonly evaluated by reporting the percentage of test images whose estimated location is within a dis-tance of x from the ground truth latitude/longitude co-ordinates. In early works, e.g. [9], common ranges for x were: { 1 , 10 , 50 , 100 , 1000 } kilometres . More recently, with the improvement of the algorithms X  performances, ranges of x = { 10 , 100 , 500 } meters have also been investigated [3]. In order to obtain insights into the positional accuracy of Flickr X  X  geotagged images, we chose to manually annotate images of ten venues. These venues were chosen with the following criteria in mind:
GeoNames, http://www.geonames.org/ should only differ by a few meters from the ground truth lo-cation. Here, we report the results for all three annotation types, though it should be emphasized that for images and videos taken outside a venue, we cannot make claims about the accuracy of their geotag information.

Tab. 1 provides a comprehensive overview of our annota-tion data and the results. As an example, consider the venue Sistine chapel , a small chapel in the Apostolic Palace in Vat-ican City. For the query sistine chapel (without any geo-graphic restrictions), Flickr returns nearly 30 , 000 images. When restricting the search geographically as described in Sec. 3 though, the result set shrinks to 1 , 377 images (4 . 8% of the original result set). This is a common pattern; only a small minority of images are geotagged with high accuracy.
Evident is also the range in popularity of the different venues -more than 350 , 000 images are retrieved for the query sagrada familia compared to approximately 4 , 000 im-ages for the query aachen cathedral .

When considering the annotation results of the 250 ran-domly chosen images for each venue, we find that in most cases the annotator is able to make a decision whether or not the image was indeed taken inside the venue. The re-sults for unknown often stem from close-ups, where it is not possible to decide where exactly the images was taken.
The most important information with respect to our re-search question is shown in the last three columns of Tab. 1. Here, the average (as well as minimum and maximum) dis-tance of the annotated images to the ground truth location is shown in meters. Again as an example, the images that were found to have been taken inside the Sistine Chapel, have on average a distance of 167 meters to the ground truth loca-tion; the minimum being 5 meters and the maximum being more than 450 meters. For the images that were taken out-side the Sistine Chapel, the distances are greater, as one would expect. However, when considering the venues with more than 8 , 000 geotagged images ( hagia sophia , sagrada familia , paris notre dame ), a very different picture emerges: the average distance to the ground truth is less than 15 me-ters, and the maximum distance is 27 meters. Thus, for very popular destinations, the images are indeed closely aligned with the ground truth location.

Fig. 2 presents a different view of the data: here, the num-ber of geotagged images in the spatial neighbourhood are plotted against the average and maximum distances of the annotated images to their ground truth location. A trend is clearly visible, though more venues need to be investigated for a more precise analysis.

To this end, we se-lected ten venues and manually annotated 2500 items with respect to being taken inside or outside the venue. By fo-cusing on the images that were taken inside the venue, we were able to compare their Flickr-based latitude/longitude coordinates with ground truth coordinates derived for each venue from Wikipedia.

We found that the accuracy of the geotag information strongly depends on the number of items available on Flickr in the neighbourhood of the venue -images taken at highly popular venues have a high degree of accuracy, while im-ages taken at less popular venues exhibit a lower degree of accuracy. In particular, we found an average difference be-tween the gold standard location and the provided location of 11  X  13 meters for the popular venues and differences of approximately 47  X  167 meters for the less popular venues. This finding has implications for several applications that rely on such data sources, as they often assume highly pre-cise location information.

In future work, we plan to address a number of limitations our current study has. It is known that GPS-enabled devices
