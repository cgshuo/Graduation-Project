 We conducted a study comparing avatar conferencing with video and audio conferencing for work s cenarios. We studied nine four-person teams using a within-subject s design that measured users X  perceptions and preferences across the conferencing conditions. Video was rated highest in all m easures. Avatar and Audio were rated similarly, except for sociability, where Avatar was rated higher than Audio, and realism, where Avatar was rated lower than Audio. While users appreciated how avatar conferencing brought them together in a common virtual space, they found the cartoon avatars to be inappropriate for a professional discussion. As a result, participants preferred Video the most and Avatar the least for a business meeting. Lower ratings for the avatar condition were partly due to users X  frustrations when the avatar system did not track them perfectly. When assuming a  X  X erfect X  system, preference for Avatar increased significantly while preference for Audio and Video remained unchanged. H5.3. Group and Organization Interfaces (CSCW).
 Conferencing; audio; video; avatar; distributed teams. Recently available commercial technologies have enabled new forms of synchronous conferencing using video and avatars. Desktop video services enable n-way video conferences where each participant can be seen at all times. Meanwhile, avatar representations in a virtual world, popularized by online gaming, afford meeting and interacting toge ther in a virtually constructed setting. As these technologies gain popularity in consumer markets, we expect they will also be used in workplace meetings. However, the visual representati on of meeting participants may affect the interactions that occur in these mediated environments, and we explore their impact in this study. We were interested to see how avatar conferencing compared with more traditional audio and video conferencing in the workplace. Avatar conferencing enables users to collaborate together through virtual avatars that represent each person X  X  bodily movements in both gaming [6] and commercial applications [3]. Until recently, embodying these avatars required users to make manual keyboa rd and mouse commands that translated into basic avatar actions (e.g., walk forward, wave). More recent systems, such as Microsoft X  X  Avatar Kinect, capture users X  motions through depth cameras and use the depth information to animate 3D cartoon avatars to reflect users X  body movements. This natural user interface can automatically convey non-verbal cues. Compared to video conferencing, avatar conferencing has many potential user experience advantages. Virtual avatars abstract away the users X  real environm ents, which can mitigate privacy concerns that video evokes [2] a nd also enable users to manage their appearance (for example, looking professional when joining from home). Furthermore, virtual worlds can create a common meeting space for distributed team members connecting from diverse settings. Virtual avatars can even synthesize non-verbal cues, such as turning toward the current speaker, which could strengthen the sense of presence (defined as the feeling of being socially present with people at a remote location [8]). The goal of our study was to compare multi-party avatar conferencing to video and audio conferencing for workplace collaboration. Several prior studies have already compared video and audio conferencing and documented advantages of the visual channel [10], [11]. In particular , social presence increased with the bandwidth of the communi cation medium (e.g., social presence was higher for video than audio) [9]. We were interested in how avatar conferencing would compare with audio and video. Previous work by Bente et al. [1] compared avatar conferencing with audio, video, and text c onferencing in two-way conferences between strangers. They found that avatar and video conferencing were similar with respect to user satisfaction, trust, and social presence. However, it is unclear how these results generalize to multi-party groups, where the fidelity of visual cues, such as facial expressions and gaze awareness, become more important. Prior work [7], [10] has shown that using video to provide these visual cues can help reduce potential interaction ambiguities that can occur with more than two pe ople in a conference. Thus, it is important to re-evaluate avatar, audio, and video conferencing in multi-party scenarios. We c hose to examine four-way conferencing as a large enough group to exercise both gaze awareness and non-verbal communication cues. By studying avatar, video, and a udio conferencing, we could see how adding different representations of visual cues to the shared audio communication (which wa s common across all conditions) affected the collaboration. Intuitively, adding avatar visual cues should improve the experience over audio alone. However, avatars are not as high fidelity as video. Moreover, cartoon aspects of avatars may conflict with users X  expectations of how remote people should be presented visually. Thus, it is interesting to explore how the avatar experience compares to video. Our user study compared audio-only ( Audio ) and audio-video ( Video ) conferencing with 3D-avatar conferencing ( Avatar ) using existing commercial tools. In all three conditions, Skype group audio conferencing provided the audio channel. For Video conferencing, we used Skype Gr oup Video Calling, configured to show all of the remote participan ts aligned horizontally, as shown in Figure 1 (right panel). For Avatar conferencing, we used a beta version of Microsoft Avatar Kinect, an XBOX 360 avatar chat application. Avatar Kinect animates a cartoon avatar in a virtual world based on a user X  X  movements in the real world. The Kinect sensor tracks the user X  X  upper body motion, includi ng torso and arm positions, as well as some facial features, namely, mouth and eyebrows. Based on the tracking data, the avatar mimics posture changes, hand waves, head turns, lip movements, and facial expressions in real time. However, unlike video, these visual cues are presented by animating a computer-generated , cartoon avatar. We chose a virtual world where avatars sat in a circle (see Figure 1, left panel). Each participant had a thir d-person view of the world as if standing behind their own avatar. Th is view most closely matched the view of others in Skype, although Skype X  X  preview of oneself is frontal and not over-the-shoulder. In Figure 1, the local user, whose avatar is at the bottom of th e screen, can see that all avatars are looking at the avatar at the top of the screen, thus conveying a shared sense of gaze awareness. We recruited 36 participants (16 females, 20 males), in 9 groups with 4 participants per group, from within Microsoft, a large software company. As prior work has demonstrated, participants X  familiarity with each other affects their conferencing experience [4], and since participants in a business meeting are usually familiar with each other, we recr uited participants who already knew each other. Our participants will be referred to as (P where x is the group number and y is the participant number within that group. Each group of participants used all three conferencing technologies and worked through three brainstorming meetings that were equivalent in struct ure but involved different, although related, topics. We chose a br ainstorming task since it is a common business practice that requires participation from everyone and may involve persua sion and negotiation, for which visual cues are important. We selected discussion topics (features of next generation mobile devi ces) that are important to our participants X  company to provide some inherent motivation for the task. One discussion focu sed on smartphones, another on tablet devices, and the remaini ng discussion focused on mobile search. For each condition, the pa rticipants brainstormed for about 10 minutes. The study administrators then interrupted them and asked them to agree on the top four features discussed during the brainstorming and their priority order. Each of the four conference participants was placed in a different room that had a 40 X  LCD 1080p TV, a headset, an XBOX 360, and a computer. For the Avatar c ondition, participants spent 5-10 minutes creating avatars that looked like them by tailoring avatar attributes, such as hair style, and facial features. For all three conferencing technologies, the partic ipants used a headset to hear and talk to each other. In the Audio condition, the TV showed a blank computer desktop. In the Video condition, participants saw video windows of remote participants on the TV through Skype Group Video Calling, as shown in Figure 1 (right). In the Avatar condition, participants saw their avatars in a virtual location together with the avatars of the remote participants through Microsoft Avatar Kinect, as shown in Figure 1 (left). We used a within-subjects study design with condition order counterbalanced using a Partial Latin Square design. All groups performed the brainstorming tasks in the same order, starting with smartphone features, followed by tablet features, and finishing with mobile search features on smartphone and tablet devices. We chose a within-subjects design to reduce the impact of individual differences and enable users to compare across conditions. At the start of a study session, all participants completed an initial questionnaire that asked for thei r demographic information and prior experience with smartphones, tablets, and avatars. The participants also completed a questionnaire after each brainstorming task. Finally, all participants completed a questionnaire at the end of the session that compared across conditions and took part in a group debriefing session. The post-task questionnaires cons isted of different groups of questions: social presence ; conversation mechanics and non-verbal communication cues ; and realism . The social presence questions used anchored seven-poi nt scales, while the remainder of the questions utilized seven-point Likert-type scales from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The social presence questions focused on how the users perceived the various conferencing technologies from a social perspective. These questions probed four dimens ions that have been shown to differentiate social presence in telecommunications [9]: impersonal-personal, cold-war m, insensitive-sensitive, and unsociable-sociable . The questions regarding conversation mechanics and non-verbal cues probed for the impact of the conferencing technologies on th e conversation flow and non-verbal cue awareness. Sample questions included:  X  X  could easily tell who was speaking X  and  X  X  c ould speak up in the discussion without interrupting someone el se. X  The questions focusing on realism were included to help us understand how cartoon avatars compared to audio and video for communication purposes. Sample questions included:  X  X t wa s just as though we were all in the same room X ,  X  X he other people seemed real X . Participants were also invited to provide fr ee-form comments, reactions, likes, and dislikes about each system. After completing all three tasks, participants were asked to rate each condition on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 was  X  X ot useful at all X  and 10 was  X  X xtremely useful . X  This question was repeated after asking the participants to assume perfect system performance, looking past current system flaws, such as poor motion tracking or audio lag. Analyses were performed using Aligned Rank Transform, a new technique to enable use of para metric statistics on non-parametric data [12]. There were no significant effects of gender. Significant main effects of condition were found for each of the social presence factors: impersonal-personal (F 2,70 =16.33 p&lt;.001), cold-warm (F 2,70 =6.88 p&lt;.005), insensitive-sensitive (F p&lt;.001), and unsociable-sociable (F 2,70 =16.33 p&lt;.001). Figure 2 shows the mean rating for each factor. Bonferroni corrected post-hoc pairwise comparison revealed that for all of the factors, the Video condition was rated signi ficantly higher than Audio ( p &lt;.005). The Video condition was also rated significantly higher than the Avatar condition for the personal and sensitive dimensions ( p &lt;.005). However, no significant differences were found between Video and Avatar for warm ( p =.19) and sociable ( p =.47). The Avatar condition was rated significantly higher than Audio for being sociable ( p &lt;.005) but was not significantly different from Audio for the other three factors ( p &gt;.09). Participants X  comments supported these results:  X  Audio was the least personal and hardest to use in the realm of an unstructured meeting. Video was the most personal and the easiest to use. Kinect was easy to use and s lightly more personal than audio (P 4,3 ) X .  X  I liked the video the best because you can see how people react; get to know their personalities + it is like being in the same room as people. The avatar wa s a cool way at looking at conferences but I think it could be distracting if the discussion is business related. Audio is good, just very impersonal (P The questionnaire also probed participants X  impressions of non-verbal cues in the conferencing conditions, the seamlessness of the conversation, and whether people felt they could speak up without being interrupted (see Table 1). A significant main effect of condition was found for each question and Bonferroni corrected post-hoc pairwise comp arison revealed Video was rated significantly higher than Avatar and Audio ( p &lt;.005), with no significant differences between th e Avatar and Audio conditions ( p &gt;.07). Commenting on Video, one participant said:  X  Much more able to glean subtle reactions (P 10,1 ). X  Four questions probed the realism of the conferencing environments and how close it was to  X  X aving a face-to-face discussion X  (see Table 1). Signifi cant main effects of condition were found for each question. Bonferroni corrected post-hoc pairwise comparison revealed that for all of these questions Video was rated significantly higher than Avatar and Audio ( p &lt;.001) and no significant differences were found between Avatar and Audio ( p &gt;.05). When asked whether  X  X t was just as though we were all in the same room, X  the Video condition was rated significantly higher than Avatar and Audio ( p &lt;.05), and the Avatar condition was rated significantly higher than the Audio condition ( p &lt;.005). As one participant commented,  X  The people sitting in the one virtual room in the avatar space is a really important factor  X  makes you feel you are all at the same table and on equal footing (P 5,4 ) X . Consistent with the above ratings (on a scale from 1-10), a significant main effect of condition was found for overall preference (F 2,70 =15.66 p&lt;.001). Bonferroni corrected post-hoc pairwise comparison revealed that Video (m=8.9) was rated as significantly more useful for di stributed meetings than Audio (m=6.9) and Avatar (m=5.1) ( p &lt;.005), with 78% of participants rating Video highest. While th e Avatar condition was rated similarly to (and sometimes higher than) Audio on all of the individual dimensions examined, it was rated significantly lower than Audio in terms of overall usefulness ( p &lt;.05).

X  However, they found that in the Audio condition, it was sometimes  X  difficult to interject and add thoughts and concerns (P 4,3 ) X ;  X  was hard to stay focused (P  X  hard to manage conversation mechanics (P 5,1 ). X  While many of the participants found the Avatar condition to be  X  fun , X  their main reservations were that it was not professional or serious enough for a business meeting. For example,  X  I can X  X  see it being used in a professional setting. I would have a hard time taking a Kinect meeting seriously (P 4,3 ) X  and  X  Kinect is fun but not for business. The exception would be if you needed to communicate as effectively as possible but had to remain anonymous (P 7,5 Participants also found the Avatar condition distracting because of  X  erratic arm movements and not always picking up who was talking (P 6,5 ). X  Users also wanted  X  a clearer way to see who is speaking (P 5,4 ) X  and more realistic avatars. However, when participants re-evaluated the three conferencing conditions assuming they were  X  X erfect X , the ratings for Video (m=9.1) and Audio (m=7.0) did not change significantly ( p &gt;.2) whereas the ratings for the Avatar condition (m=6.8) increased significantly (Wilcoxon Z =-4.4, p &lt;.001). As a result, the difference between Avatar and Audio was no longer significant, ( p &gt;.9). Besides illustrating the future potential of avatar conferencing as the tec hnology progresses, these responses also suggest a perception that a udio and video have  X  X opped out, X  with little expectation for improved user experiences in video or audio. Overall, we found that Video was significantly better in almost all measures of social presence, non-verbal cues and conversational mechanics, and realism than the Audio and Avatar conditions. This result contrasts with Bente et al. [1 ], who did not find a difference in video compared to other conferencing technologies. We hypothesize that our groups of four who were familiar with each other presented higher interaction demands compared to the dyads of strangers used in their study. We were surprised that users preferred Audio over the Avatar condition despite ranking Avatar si milarly and sometimes higher on the dimensions studied. Survey responses indicated that the workplace context was not a good fit with the cartoon avatars currently offered in Avatar Kinect. This reaction extends prior work [5] which found certain static cartoon avatar icons to be unsuitable for work. It was also interesting to see that users rated the Avatar condition lower on realism (m=4.0) compared to Audio (m=4.7). We surmise that since the participants knew each other, they were able to project a realistic confer ence experience even in the Audio condition, but that the cartoon avatars actually interfered with their sense of realism. More research is needed to find avatars that are realistic enough to appear professi onal but avoid negative reactions around the uncanny valley. Furthermore, some users found the Avatar system distracting because of flaws in the motion tracking. Nevertheless, users did recognize the benefit of a common setting and opportunity for anonymity in avatar conferencing. Also, their ratings for a perfected system show that avatar conferencing has future potential. As this technology matures with more accurate tracking and more professional avatar representations, there is an opportunity for more widespread use of it in workplace settings. Although we focused on participant pe rceptions in audio, video, and avatar conferencing, it would also be useful to evaluate the task outcomes with each technology. A comparison of the brainstorming results among the conditions in a future study could offer further insights into the use of avatar conferencing in stimulating creative work.
