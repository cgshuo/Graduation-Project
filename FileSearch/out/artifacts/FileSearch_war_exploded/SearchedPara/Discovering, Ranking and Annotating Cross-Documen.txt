 This paper presents CDRMiner , a system for automatically discovering, ranking and annotating cross-document links between concepts. Specifically, we focus on detecti ng hidden associations between two concepts and further gener ating annotations for each discovered hypothesis. We inte rpret such a relationship query as finding the most meaningful c oncept chains and evidence trails across multiple documents that potentially connect them. These functionalities are implemented using an interactive visualization paradigm which assists us ers for a better understanding and interpretation of discovered hypo theses, and matching their domain knowledge with the algorithmi c power of text mining techniques.

Text Mining, Cross Document Summarization, Graph Mi ning The availability of large volumes of text documents has created the potential to discover valuable information hidd en in those texts. This in turn has created the need for automa ted methods of discovering such information without having to read it all. The main theme of this research is based on the hypothe ses that the whole (document collection) is greater than the sum of its parts (individual documents). Interesting links and hidde n information that connect facts, propositions or hypotheses can be found by using novel text mining techniques along with tradi tional data mining techniques. Our previous work has defined concept chain queries ( CCQ ) [1], a special case of text mining in document collectio ns focusing on detecting links between two concepts. A traditional search involving, for example, two person names will attem pt to find documents mentioning both these individuals. This research focuses on a different interpretation of such a que ry: what is the best concept chain and evidence trail across docume nts that potentially connect them? For example, both may be football lovers, but mentioned in different documents. This information can only be gleaned from multiple documents. A gene ralization of this task involves query terms representing general concepts (e.g. foreign policy, visa applicant). Formally, a concept chain query involving concepts A and B has the following meaning: find the most plausible rela tionship between concept A and concept B assuming that one o r more instances of both concepts occur in the corpus, but not necessarily in the same document. We go one step further and re quire the response to be an optimal set of text snippets extr acted from multiple documents that can best explain the logic connection between input concepts. Research in data mining has so far mostly focused on developing efficient algorithms to disco ver various kinds of patterns, but little attention has been pa id to the important next step  X  interpreting the discovered p atterns. In this research, we propose a novel problem of generating semantic annotations for discovered associations. A mixture model [2] has been developed to accomplish this goal through gene rating an in-depth and concise cross-document summary of the pla usible relationship between concepts. Our system is designed as a stand-alone system runn ing on any PC with Microsoft .NET framework 2.0 or above. It pr ovides an interactive interface for users to import the docum ent collection and domain -specific thesauri. Users can guide the discovery process through setting appropriate parameters, and visualize and analyze the results. Specifically, the system consi sts of the following major components:  X  Concept Association Graph (CAG) Construction Module :  X  Concept Profile (CP) and Snippet Cluster (SC)  X  Concept Chain Generation and Ranking Module: perform  X  Relationship Annotation and Ranking Module: Generate Figure 1 illustrates the main CDRMiner interactive interface. Based on user specified paths for data collection a nd domain specific thesaurus, the Concept Association Graph ( CAG ) representation is first constructed. Users are then provided another set of parameters to guide the discovery process, e .g., max_len controls the maximum length of desired chains; chain_num specifies the number of top ranked chains to be ret urned for each possible length. The visualized result for concept chain query involving person names  X  Bush  X  and  X  Bin Ladin  X  with the parameter values max_len (3) and chain -num (5) is shown in Fig. 1. The system offers different views of the generat ed output: a) Chain Solution View (in the upper-left pane). This view gives b) XML Data View (in the upper-right pane). This view links c) Graphical View . This view further synthesizes the generated d) Semantic annotation View (in the bottom right pane) . This All views are synchronized, so that changes to one auto matically update the others. The bottom-right pane also provi des additional information for a particular node or edge occurring in a concept chain. When the node (edge) is double-clicked in th e graphical view, the associated concept profile (snippet clust er) will be displayed accordingly. [1] Jin, W., Srihari, R. K., and Ho, H. 2007.
