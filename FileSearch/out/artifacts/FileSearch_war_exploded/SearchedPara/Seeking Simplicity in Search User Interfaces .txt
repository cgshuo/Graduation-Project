 It is rare for a new user interface to break through and become successful, especially in information-intensive tasks like search, coming to consensus or building up knowledge. Most complex interfaces end up going unused. Often the successful solution lies in a previously unexplored part of the interface design space that is simple in a new way that works just right. In this talk I will give exam ples of such successes in the information-intensive interface design space, and attempt to provide stimulating ideas for future research directions. H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  Search Process Dr. Marti Hearst is a professor in the School of Information at UC Berkeley, with an affiliate appointment in the Computer Science Division. Her primary research interests are user interfaces for search engines, information visualization, natural language processing and, more recently, improving MOOCs. She was recently named a Fellow of the ACM, and has won two departmental Excellence in Teaching Awards. She is also known for the book Search User Interfaces and for the Flamenco project which advanced faceted naviga tion as a standard search technique, for lexico-syntactic patterns for ontology discovery ( X  X earst patterns X ), the TextTiling discourse segmentation technique, and the TileBars query term visualization technique. Prof. Hearst is on the editorial board of ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction and was formerly on the boards of ACM Transactions on the Web, Computational Linguistics, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, and IEEE Intelligent Systems. Prof. Hearst has received an NSF CAREER award, an IBM Faculty Award, a Google Research Award, and an Okawa Foundation Research Grant.
