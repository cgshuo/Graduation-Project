 The unprecedented and quickly expanding success of the Social Web and related phe-nomena such as social networking and collaborative tagging , raised the importance of studying the behavior and the habits of Social Web users.

Several authors were committed to studying human behaviors within each single platform, considered as a single and autonomous entity [Catanese et al. 2011].
On top of that, investigating user behavior is even more interesting across systems, if we consider the fact that, nowadays, users have a plethora of possible choices and often they subscribe to different platforms that provide different but related services [Carmagnola and Cena 2009; De Meo et al. 2009a; Iofciu et al. 2010]. Indeed, users can behave on each of those platforms in similar (or different) manners, depending on the context and the platform.

In this article we report our findings on the behavior of users belonging to different social platforms. We focused on Social Sharing systems , that is, on Social Web systems allowing users to post, tag and share resources as well as to become friends each other. In our research, we considered three popular social platforms, namely Flickr, Delicious and StumbleUpon.

We decided to consider these systems for two main reasons: first of all, they are quite popular and this allowed us to gather a sufficiently large data sample to perform a significant analysis. Secondly, in these systems, user contributed tags are a powerful knowledge management tool : tags, in fact, can be used to make the retrieval of resources easier or to raise the visibility of user generated contents. Tags, in other words, have also a semantic value because from their analysis it is possible to infer general concepts exploited by users [Cantador et al. 2011; De Meo et al. 2009b]. Tagging is also present in other platforms but with different purposes and goals: for instance, in Facebook users are allowed to apply tags but their tagging activity has no semantic value: a tag in Facebook is used to link objects (e.g., a person to a photo). Therefore, if a user tags people, pages and places in her posts, she has the goal, for instance, of informing friends about the people she is with.

In our investigation we focused on two, possibly related, aspects, that is, (i) under-standing to what extent the architecture and the features of a Social Sharing system influence the behavior of its users, and, (ii) analyzing if there exists a relation between the users X  social behavior (i.e., the tendency of users to socialize among each other) and their tagging behavior (i.e., the aptitude of users to label resources).

Regarding point (i), we investigate (a) if the number of friends of a user significantly varies across different systems; (b) if users exploit a similar amount of tags and, from a semantic perspective, if users in some systems prefer to focus on a narrow set of topics whereas in other systems their interests are described by a broader group of topics; (c) if users exploit each platform to focus on a specific topic or, otherwise, if they discuss similar topics on different platforms.

As for point (ii), we investigate (d) if there exists a correlation between the activity of tagging resources and the tendency to making new friends across the given Social Sharing platforms, and, most importantly, if the behavior of a given user is somehow similar to the behavior of her friends. To this purpose we studied (e) the semantic variety of topics exploited by a user against those addressed by her friends, and, (f) the breadth of the topics covered by a user against those exploited by her contacts.
To do so, in this work we adopt techniques from social network analysis and semantic-based analysis . In particular, we studied at the statistical level the frequency of tagging activities and the frequency of friending activities. We used external thesauri (like WordNet [Fellbaum 1998]) and ontologies (like DBPedia [Auer et al. 2007]) to map user contributed tags onto lexicographic or ontological concepts and infer the topics exploited by users.

The importance and relevance of investigating these aspects is motivated by a mul-titude of scientific, economic, and societal considerations.

For example, understanding if the tagging and social behavior of a given user on a specific platform depends on the architecture and design feature of the platform itself could help platform designers to decide whether to modify the ways users interact with the platform in order to maximize, for instance, their loyalty.

From a sociological perspective, if we would prove that users show a particular social behavior on a given platform, this could be helpful to design novel social theories explaining how user relationships emerge and evolve over time depending on the design features of the platform a user is currently accessing.

The main findings of our work can be summarized as follows. (1) The tendency of a user to socialize depends on the features of the system in which (2) In Delicious and Flickr, the aptitude of a user to apply tags is independent of the (3) The vast majority of users tend to apply most of their tags in a uniform fashion (4) In Flickr there is a strong correlation between the intensity of tagging and the (5) The variety of lexicographic concepts that people use within different Social Sharing
The rest of the article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present some back-ground material as well as a detailed description of the main features of Flickr, Deli-cious and StumbleUpon. Section 3 introduces our research methodology and, in par-ticular, we sketched some of the research questions that this work aims to address. The datasets exploited to perform our analysis are illustrated in Section 4. To answer our research questions, we analyze user profiles at three different levels: intensity level (discussed in Section 5), tag level (analyzed in Section 6), and semantic level (covered in Section 7). In Section 8 we illustrate some practical applications of our findings. We discuss related literature in Section 9. Finally, Section 10 concludes the article, sum-marizing our most important findings and depicting some future directions of research. In this section, we first introduce some formal definitions that will be extensively used throughout the article (see Section 2.1). After that, in Section 2.2 we will describe the main features of Flickr, Delicious, and StumbleUpon. Our research focuses on Social Sharing platforms in which a user is allowed to perform various activities such as becoming friends with other users, posting comments/reviews, rating objects, joining groups of interest, and so on. In the following, we refer to a Social Sharing platform as S and assume that users are free to join as many Social Sharing platforms as they want.

We focus on two specific activities: the first is called tagging and denotes the fact that users may apply keywords ( tags ) to label resources. Tagging is a crucial activity to collaboratively classify contents in the context of Web 2.0: for instance, labeling multi-media objects such as photos/videos makes it easier to retrieve them later. In addition, users can promote the contents they produce by tagging and exposing them to other users. The usage of tags is also relevant from a scientific standpoint: in fact, external thesauri (like WordNet) or ontologies (like DBPedia) can be applied to determine the meaning of tags.

The results of the analysis of tagging can be partially generalized to other kind of social activities like commenting/reviewing or rating objects. In fact, the analysis of user comments/ratings is useful to determine to what extent a resource is able to fit user needs. By contrast, the usage of tags implicitly denotes user interests: if a user labels an item we may guess that this item captures her interest but we can not directly quantify the level of interest, as we could do if the user would rate that item.
The second activity is called friending and indicates the ability of two users of be-coming friends. As for friending activity, we consider only friendship relationships that are explicitly declared by two users. Of course, there is a possibly wide range of implicit social relationships binding two users: think of interactions among unknown users in Question and Answering communities.

Friending is perhaps the most popular example of social behavior in Social Sharing system. However, there are several other examples of social behaviors worth of being considered and, among them, we cite the fact that users can form groups of interest and join groups set up by other users. The analysis of dynamics of group membership has recently attracted the interest of many authors: for instance, the study presented in Vasuki et al. [2011] shows that, in a Social Web system, the user social network and the affiliation network (consisting of users and their affiliations to groups) coevolve and, therefore, information on user friendships and past affiliations to groups is useful to predict what groups a target user is likely to join in the future. Yuan et al. [2011] used information on group membership in combination with Collaborative Filtering techniques to predict the rating a user would assign to an unseen item. Experiments on a real-life dataset showed that group membership is more effective than friendship in producing accurate recommendations.

The structure emerging from a collaborative tagging activity is usually known in the literature as folksonomy [Mika 2005].
 In the same spirit, the structure emerging from the overall friending actions in a Social Sharing system generates a user social network . The nodes of this social network are the users whereas each edge specifies a friendship relationship.

The folksonomy identifies the Content Dimension of a Social Sharing system: its analysis is useful to detect the contents and concepts generated within the system. The user social network, by contrast, identifies the Social Dimension of a Social Sharing system: its analysis is useful to shed light on the fabric of social relationships emerging in the system itself.

The Content and Social dimensions are not to be considered as independent entities : there is a strong relationship between the social behavior of the us and the tags they generate. Such a relationship was studied for the first time in Mika [2005]. In that paper, the author proposes a model capturing the relationships linking users, resources and tags applied by users to label resources. Other approaches used social network analysis tools to interpret the semantics of tags [Yeung et al. 2007]. Approaches based on social network analysis are fascinating because they put into evidence the associative and participatory nature of tagging process because they depict users as autonomous entities who organize knowledge according to their own rules and negotiate the meaning of tags.

We are now able to provide a more formal definition of the concepts just outlined earlier. In detailed, a folksonomy is defined as follows [Hotho et al. 2006].
Definition 2.1 ( Folksonomy ). A folksonomy FO is a quadruple FO = U , T , R , Y , where U , T , R are finite sets of instances of users , tags ,and resources and Y defines a relation (called tag assignment ) among these sets, that is, Y  X  U  X  T  X  R . The relation Y can be enriched with a timestamp indicating when the tag assignment was performed.
 Along similar lines, the concept of user social network is defined as follows. Definition 2.2 ( User Social Network ). A User Social Network SN is a pair SN =
U , F , where U is a finite set of instances of users and F defines a relation (called friendship assignment ) F  X  U  X  U . The relation F can be enriched with a timestamp indicating when the friendship was created.

Due to Definitions 2.1 and 2.2, a Social Sharing system S is a pair S = FO , SN .In order to handle tag and friendship assignments in a uniform fashion, we introduce the concept of social object as the atomic component of a Social Sharing system. Such a concept will be useful to define the content-based and the social-based profile of a user as a collection of social objects. More formally, the definition is as follow. Definition 2.3 ( Social Object ). Let S = FO , SN be a Social Sharing system being FO = U , T , R , Y and SN = U , F the folksonomy and the user social network associated with S .A social object so is either an element so  X  U or so  X  T .Asetof social objects is said to be homogeneous if all the social objects in the set represent a tag or identify a user.

The set of social objects existing in a Social Sharing system will be called social object space and will be denoted as SO .

Once we have defined the concept of social object, we can introduce the concept of metaprofile of a user u in a Social Sharing system S . The metaprofile of u is an abstract concept that can be specialized to represent the content-based (or tag-based) and the social-based profile of u . The formal definition of metaprofile is as follows.
Definition 2.4 ( Metaprofile ). Let: (i) S = FO , SN be a Social Sharing system, (ii) u beauserin S and (iii) C u ={ so 1 ,... so m } be a set of homogeneous social objects. Let w : SO  X  R be a function (called weighting function ) mapping social objects onto real numbers. The metaprofile MP ( u )of u is a set of pairs
If all the social objects in C u are tags, then the metaprofile of u is called content (or tag-based ) profile of u and it is denoted as P T ( u ). If all the social objects in C u are user identifiers, then the metaprofile of u is called social profile of u and it is denoted as P S ( u ).

Definition 2.4 is general enough to contain some popular definition of user profile in Social Web systems. In detail, if we assume that C u coincides with the set of tags applied by u and, for each tag t i  X  C u ,weset w ( t i ) equal to the frequency of assigning t , we get the definition of content-based profile already introduced in Tso-Sutter et al. [2008]. By contrast, if C u is the set of tags exploited by u to look for resources, then we re-obtain the definition of tag-based user profile introduced in De Meo et al. [2010]. A special case occurs if C u is the set of tags applied by u and w ( t i ) is set equal to 1 for all t i  X  C u . In such a case we obtain the well-known concept of personomy [Hotho et al. 2006].

In an analogous fashion, if we assume that C u is a set of user identifiers and, for each user v  X  C u ,weset w ( v ) = 1if u and v are friends and 0 otherwise, then the social profile of u coincides with the network of her friends. Of course, other more complex choices are also possible: given a user v  X  C u we can set w ( v ) equal to the strength of the tie joining u and v . Such a weight can be computed, for instance, by applying the methodology outlined in Gilbert and Karahalios [2009].

The content-based and social-based profiles of a user can be studied according to different perspectives.

As for content-based profiles, we can study them at the intensity level (e.g., the fre-quency of usage of tags), at the variety level (e.g., the number of distinct tags composing the profile) and, finally at the topic level (i.e., we can use external ontologies to map tags onto concepts and compute if a user is always concerned with few topics or not). By con-trast, since no semantics can be assigned to friendship relationships, the social-based profile can be analyzed only at the intensity level . In this section we describe the main features of three social systems that have been exploited to carry out our analysis, namely Flickr, Delicious and StumbleUpon. Flickr is a Web site providing its users with photo and video hosting facilities. In August 2011, the number of Flickr users amounted to more than 51 million and more than 6 billion images were available in the platform.

Delicious is a social bookmarking systems , that is, it allows its members to label and share URLs. In the late 2008 the number of users registered to Delicious was about 5.3 million and the estimated number of available URLs was about 180 million.
StumbleUpon is a Web search engine designed with the goal of finding and recom-mending Web contents (like photos or Web pages) to its users. StumbleUpon relies on collaborative filtering algorithms to build communities of like-minded users. In this fashion, a user should stumble upon pages that have been explicitly recommended by her friends or peers. In April 2012, StumbleUpon announced that it had more than 25 million registered users. At the moment of collecting data, StumbleUpon did not provided social features to its users but only tagging ones.

The systems described here can be classified according to different criteria, related to how tagging activity is conceived and to the social behaviors they support.
Here we provide some classification criteria that are, in our opinion, useful to better explain user behaviors. (1) User Social Network . A first classification criterium depends on the fact that the (2) Supporting Social Activities Beyond Friendship . One of the most relevant features (3) Free Tagging . In both Delicious and Flickr users are allowed to decide what tags (4) Broad vs. Narrow Folksonomy . Folksonomies can be classified into broad and nar-
In Table I we report the main features of Flickr, Delicious, and StumbleUpon accord-ing to the criteria we have introduced. As pointed out in the Introduction, in our research we are interested in studying two major phenomena: ( i ) to investigate to what extent the features of a Social Sharing platform influence user behaviors, and ( ii ) to study whether a form of correlation exists between the social and tagging behavior of a user. This leads to define some research questions and, for each question, to formulate a research hypothesis.

In the following we explain our research questions and related hypotheses. A first research theme we want to explore is about the influence that the features of a Social Sharing system has on its users and, in detail, we want to check whether meaningful differences in user behaviors emerge when users shift among systems. Such an analysis leads us to formulate the following research questions and hypotheses.  X  Q 1 . Does the intensity of user activities carried out by a user in a Social Sharing system S depend on the features of the platform? We are interested to study to what extent the design features of a Social Sharing system stimulate users to socialize with other users and label contents.  X  H 1 . The level of user involvement depends on the features of the Social Sharing system in which she operat . We hypothesize that the features of a Social Sharing system deeply impact of the tendency of a user to create relationships and label resources.  X  Q 2 . Does the variety of tags exploited by a user depend on the features of the Social
Sharing system in which she is operating? In other words, do users tend to reuse the same tags in different systems or, vice versa, does the process of selecting tags depend on the Social Sharing system?  X  H 2 . Users tend, on average, to use different tags . We believe that tags are reliable indicators of user needs and preferences. Since users join different platforms with different goals, the tags they use in different systems should reflect these different goals and, therefore, they should be different from a system to another one.  X  Q 3 . How does the variety of topics a user is concerned with depend on the features and goals of a Social Sharing platform? For instance, do people always focus on the same topics even if they shift from a Social Sharing system to another one or do they consider different topics in different systems?  X  H 3 . The variety of user topics varies significantly from a Social Sharing system to another one . We expect that, depending on the features of a Social Sharing system, users tend to state different kind of interests and, therefore, they consider different topics in different Social Sharing systems. A second research theme we focus on is about the relationships that exist between social and tagging behaviors. In detail, we aim at answering the following research questions.  X  Q 4 . Does the intensity of the activity a user carries out in a Social Sharing system depend on the type of activity? . In other words, we are interested in assessing whether a form of correlation exists between the frequency of tagging activities of a user and the number of her social contacts.  X  H 4 . The intensity of tagging activity is related to the intensity of friending activity and vice versa . We believe that in each Social Sharing system there is a small fraction of active users who are densely connected with other users and, at the same time, generate a large volume of contents/tags in the platform.  X  Q 5 . Does the variety of tags a user exploits correlate with the number of her social contacts? In other words, is there a relationship between the number of distinct tags composing the profile of a user and the number of tags in the profiles of her friends?  X  H 5 . The variety of tags exploited by a user is related to the number of her social contacts . According to the homophily principle in sociology (which states that user with similar tastes are likely to be friends), we guess that a user share one or more interests with her friends. Therefore, users with a great number of friends should also present highly diversified interests. To answer the research questions we have formulated, we analyzed user profiles in Social Sharing systems at three different levels of granularity.  X  Intensity level . At this level we studied user behaviors on the basis of the  X  X olume X  of the activities they carried out. We started our analysis by comparing the frequency of tagging ft u of a user u in different social systems, that is, the number of tags that a user applied. We studied also the frequency of social interactions fs u of u in different social system, that is, the number of friends of u . We compared ft u and fs u in different social systems.  X  Tag level . At this level we focused on the tag-based profile of a user. We started studying whether these profiles focused on few (and often frequently used) tags or, vice versa, if users prefer to use a large number of tags. In the first case, user interests appear strongly polarized towards few tags. Therefore, it is easy to predict, for instance, what kind of objects a user will look for in the future. By contrast, if tags are applied in a uniform fashion, the amount of randomness in a profile is high and, therefore, the task of predicting future user interests is hard. We compared the frequency of tagging by a user with that of her friends to study whether significant differences emerge.  X  Semantic level . In addition to analyzing the raw tags that people use to describe resources, the semantic analysis investigates the actual concepts that people refer to. In particular, we analyzed to what extent tag-based profiles can be mapped onto ( i ) lexicographic and ( ii ) ontological concepts in the context of different Social Sharing systems. Moreover, we investigated to what extend the variety of semantic profiles depends on the given environment in which a user performed the corresponding tagging activities.
 In order to carry out our analysis we collected the public profiles of 421,188 distinct users by means of the Google Social Graph API. Data were collected from September 2009 to January 2011. Such an API is capable of finding connections among persons on the Web. It can be queried through an HTTP request having a URL called node as its parameter. The node specifies the URL of a Web page of a user u .

The Google Social Graph API is able to return two kinds of results.  X  A list of public URLs that are associated with u . For instance, it reveals the URLs of the blog of u and of her Twitter page.  X  A list of publicly declared connections among users . For instance, it returns the list of persons who, in at least one social network, have a link to a page that can be associated with u .

The whole dataset used in this article is available at the following URL: http://www. wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/data/crosstags.tar.gz.

After collecting data, we observed that 1,467 users had a profile on Flickr and Deli-cious and only 321 users had a profile in all the three systems.

The tagging statistics of the users at Flickr, Delicious, and StumbleUpon are listed in Table II (FDS dataset). Overall, these users performed 387,786 tag assignments (TAS). On Flickr, users tagged most actively with, on average, 532.99 tag assignments, followed by Delicious (483.58 TAS) and StumbleUpon (191.48 TAS). It is interesting to see that Delicious tags constitute the largest vocabulary although most of the tagging activities were done in Flickr: the Delicious folksonomy contains 21,239 distinct tags while the Flickr folksonomy covers 18,240 distinct tags. Correspondingly, tag-based Delicious profiles contain, on average, 66.17 distinct tags in contrast to 56.82 distinct tags for the Flickr profiles.

Table III lists the tagging statistics of those users who have a Flickr and Delicious account, but are not necessarily registered to StumbleUpon (FD dataset).

Figure 1 depicts the number of tag assignments for the users of the FDS dataset. For the three platforms, we observe that there is a small fraction of users who performed a large number of tag assignments. For example, less than 5% of the users performed more than 500 tag assignments in Flickr and Delicious respectively. The majority of users is rather moderately active: for example, in Delicious, approximately 70% of the people perform between 50 and 300 tag assignments.

As for social behaviors, we have restricted our attention only on friendship relation-ships. In fact, in Flickr groups have a great relevance because they offer users the chance of sharing their photos with a worldwide audience and, due to this reason, Flickr groups are often able to attract a large number of users. By contrast, groups in Delicious are less important and their size appear to be comparatively smaller than the typical size of a Flickr group.
 As for the number of friends, a heavy-tailed like distribution also emerges (see Figure 2). For example, there are only a few users (less than 5%) who have more than 500 friends on Flickr. On Delicious, people have much less friends but the distribution of the number of friends of a user is shaped as a heavy-tail. In this section, we analyze user profiles at the intensity level . In detail, we first an-alyze the deviation of the tagging frequency as well as the deviation on the number of friends for individual users. Furthermore, we investigate whether there are corre-lations between tagging and friending activities of a user within the specific Social Sharing platforms. In this scenario we considered Delicious ( D ), Flickr ( F ) and StumbleUpon ( S ) in a pair-wise fashion. For sake of simplicity, let us first consider Delicious and Flickr together. In this case, we considered only users who applied at least one tag in both Delicious and Flickr. We define the tagging deviation td DF u of a user u as Here ft D u (resp., ft F u ) is the frequency of tagging of u in Delicious (resp., Flickr).
The parameter td DF u ranges in [0,1]: if td DF u approaches 0, u tends to approximatively use the same number of tags both in Delicious and in Flickr. In an analogous fashion, we can define td DS u and td FS u to compare StumbleUpon, respectively with Delicious and Flickr. We sorted td DF u , td DS u and td FS u in decreasing order and plotted them in Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(c).
 From Figure 3(a) we can observe that td DF u decreases in an almost linear fashion. This means that the number of users showing  X  X igh X  values of td DF u is roughly the same as the number of users who show  X  X ow X  values of td DF u .

The first consequence is that in Delicious and Flickr, there is no dominant behavior and that the number of users who frequently apply tags in both of the two Social Sharing systems is roughly equal to the number of users who prefer to focus their tagging activities in just one of them.

Strong differences, instead, emerge from Figures 3(b) and 3(c). In detail, as for De-licious and StumbleUpon, only about 10% of users show a tag deviation less than 0.4. This means that their tagging activities are more focused . In general, users who heavily tag in a Social Sharing system do not tag with the same frequency in the other one. An analogous behavior emerges for Flickr and StumbleUpon. Hence, since there are many users for which the tag deviation is close to 1 and few users for whom the tag deviation is close to 0, we conclude that the user behavior varies stronger between Delicious and StumbleUpon (Figure 3(b)) and Flickr and StumbleUpon (Figure 3(c)) than between Flickr and Delicious (Figure 3(a)).

The differences in tagging behavior (and, in particular, in the frequency of tagging) can be explained by taking into account the ultimate goal of each system.

In particular, in Delicious and Flickr, users are prompted to apply tags for quickly retrieving of contents of their interest or to share a content they deem as relevant with other users. Therefore, the higher the number of exploited tags, the easier is to retrieve relevant resources. In StumbleUpon, vice versa, the need of tagging resources is less urgent; StumbleUpon, in fact, relies on human opinions that are expressed by reviews or by applying positive/negative feedbacks which are combined through Collaborative Filtering algorithms. Therefore, the ultimate goal of users in StumbleUpon is finding novel content rather than labeling contents to easily retrieve them. This explains the lower level of tagging activity of StumbleUpon users. In an analogous fashion, we studied the quantitative difference in users behavior according to the frequency of social interactions. As pointed out in Section 2.2, we focused only on Delicious and Flickr because StumbleUpon does not support social contacts among its users. Given a user u ,the friend deviation fd FD u is defined as where fs F u (resp., fs D u ) is the number of friends of u in Flickr (resp., Delicious). Note that fd FD u can feature both positive values (if fs F u &gt; fs D u ) and negative ones (in the opposite case). We sorted users on the basis of decreasing values of fd FD u and plotted the corresponding values in Figure 4.

We may observe that fd FD u is positive for about 1300 users (out of 1467). This means that users in our dataset usually prefer to create friendships in Flickr rather than in Delicious. The architecture of Flickr, therefore, creates an environment in which social networking activities are X  X n addition to tagging activities X  X ssential for the utility of the system itself. The architecture of Delicious, on the other hand, seems to lack corresponding features that create a social networking environment that people enjoy to utilize.

The value of fd FD u is larger than 200 for about 150 users (out of 1467), that is, there are users who have, in Flickr, more than 200 friends than those they have in Delicious. We believe that most of these relationships are not to be intended as true friendships and the actual number of friends of a user is much smaller. Our conjecture relies upon some studies in anthropology that reveal that there is an upper limit to the number of people with whom a user can maintain stable social relationships, and, therefore, that can be considered as actual friends . This number is known as Dunbar number [Dunbar 1998] and its value is around 130. Recently, some authors computed the average number of friendship relationships in online social network like Facebook [Catanese et al. 2011; Ferrara 2012a, 2012b] reporting that, in this context, the average number of friends of a user is between 100 and 150, in agreement with our findings.
 We studied the relationship between the frequency of tagging ft u of a user u and her frequency of social interactions fs u . We focus again on Flickr and Delicious because StumbleUpon does not feature social connections.

To graphically analyze this correlation, we used a bidimensional plane such that each user u is mapped onto a point in this plane. The abscissa of this point represents ft u whereas the ordinate coincides with fs u . The obtained results are reported in Figure 5 for Flickr and in Figure 6 for Delicious. From the analysis of these figures, we may observe that the plane can be split into four regions. (1) There is a dense region consisting of users who have few friends and, at the same (2) There is a region consisting of users who applied a large number of tags and at the (3) There is a third region formed by users with a large number of friendships but who (4) There is a fourth region populated by users who apply a large number of tags but, Given the results from our analysis at the intensity level of tagging and friending activities, we can summarize our main findings as follows. (1) As for tagging activities, users who are highly active in Delicious may also be highly (2) As for social activities, Flickr is designed to serve as a social network because (3) For Flickr, we observe that there is a correlation between the intensity of the
A possible explanation to these findings is that in Flickr, users are incentivized to apply tags and create friendships relationships because the platform represents a stim-ulant environment to popularize their photos. By means of tags and social relationships users can share with others important facts of their life (e.g., graduation party) as well as they can discover, in a serendipitous fashion, novel photos. Such a kind of incentive is less important in Delicious/StumbleUpon because users often tend to use these plat-forms as a repository of resources they deem as important and there is no urgent need to share them with others. In this section, we investigate the characteristics of the information that is featured by the tag-based profiles in the different Social Sharing environments. We thus consider a tag as a single information unit that characterize a user. We first study and assess the information carried out by the tag-based user profile P
T ( u )ofauser u in different Social Sharing systems. In detail, we studied whether u prefers to: ( a ) frequently use few tags or ( b ) use a wider set of tags that are applied in a uniform fashion.

To measure the value of the information embodied in tag-based profiles and quantify the predictability of a user X  X  tagging behavior, we adopt entropy measure [Shannon 1948]. The entropy of a tag-based profile P T ( u ) is defined as
Here, T u is the set of tags in the profile of u (see Definition 2.4). In Equation (4), p ( t ) is the probability that the tag t was utilized by u and  X  log 2 ( p ( t )) is called self-information . Using base 2 for the computation of the logarithm allows for measuring self-information as well as entropy in bits. In order to compute p ( t ), we used the individual usage frequencies of the tags as follows:
In this formula, f u ( t i ) is the number of times u applied t i . The higher the entropy of a tag-based profile, the more valuable the information in the profile. For example, profiles that feature just one single tag t have an entropy of 0, because p ( t ) would be equal to 1, which would imply log 2 ( p ( t )) = 0.

The entropy of a tag-based profile depends on both the size of the profile (number of distinct tags) and the probability distribution of the profile tags (distribution of usage frequencies).

Profiles that provide many different tags t i  X  T u which occur with roughly equal probabilities p ( t i ) have high entropy. These profiles imply a high degree of randomness and, as we previously pointed out, it would be difficult to predict the tagging behavior of the user. By contrast, those profiles that contain many different tags but feature only very few tags with a very high probability (while most tags have a very low probability) will have lower entropy.
 The entropies of user profiles in Delicious, Flickr and StumbleUpon are plotted in Figure 7: each dot represents a user whose coordinates represent the entropy of her profile in the two Social Sharing systems reported on the x and y axes, respectively. From Figure 7 we draw the following conclusions.  X  X or most of the users (81.8%: those points in Figure 7(a) that are above the dotted diagonal line; 76.5% for Figure 7(c)), the entropy of the Delicious profile is higher than the entropy of the Flickr profile and StumbleUpon profile respectively. Given that the size of the Flickr profiles is, on average, higher than the size of the Delicious profiles, it seems that the actual tag usage in Delicious is more heterogeneous than that on Flickr and is therefore also harder to predict.
  X  X lickr and StumbleUpon profiles feature, on average, a similar level of entropy: 4.41 bits for Flickr and 4.59 bits for StumbleUpon. Overall, the low entropy of Flickr profiles is an interesting and unexpected characteristic. Given that StumbleUpon provides category-like tag suggestions while Flickr allows users to freely choose tags without any tagging support, one would expect that the tagging behavior on
StumbleUpon is more predictable than the tagging behavior on Flickr. However, we reveal that the opposite behavior emerges.  X  X n average, the entropy of the Delicious profiles is 6.41 bits. As depicted in
Figure 7(a), low/high entropy of Delicious profiles does not necessarily imply low/high entropy of Flickr profiles. For example, for those users whose Delicious profile has an entropy higher than 6 bits, the entropy of the Flickr profile ranges between 0 and 10 bits. Hence, the entropy of the tag-based profiles and the predictability of the tagging behavior is rather influenced by the characteristics of the tagging than by the preferences or characteristics of the individual users. To further understand the tag usage of individual users, we analyze the variance of the tag distribution for each user. This allows us to understand whether users apply tags in a uniform fashion or, vice versa, if the fraction of tags that are exploited much more (or much less) frequently than others can be regarded as negligible.

More formally, let T u be the tags applied by u and let  X  u be the average usage frequency of u . The variance  X  u is defined as
If  X  u 0, then u tends to apply tags in a uniform fashion; vice versa, if  X  u achieves high values then there are some tags that are much more (resp., much less) frequently applied than others.

In Figure 8, we plot the variance of the users X  tag based profiles in Flickr, Delicious and StumbleUpon respectively. The highest occurs for Flickr users, followed by Deli-cious and StumbleUpon. This observation is in line with the previous findings where we assessed that Flickr profiles feature, on average, the lowest entropy.

We furthermore compute the largest variance  X  max ,thatis:  X  max = max u  X  u . Then, we deduce the percentage P ( k ) of users who have a variance less than k  X   X  max . Here, k is a threshold value that we set to k = 0 . 001 , 0 . 01 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 1. Such an analysis is motivated by the following observation: if P ( k )  X  1, almost all users present a variance less than k  X   X  same frequency. The obtained results are reported in Table IV.

We observe that 97.61% of the Delicious user profiles and 94.61% of the Flickr user profiles feature a variance that deviates less than 10% from the highest value. This means that the vast majority of users tend to apply tags in an homogeneous fashion. However, as depicted in Figure 8 (and particularly for Flickr), there are also tags (in some user profiles) that are used much more frequently than others ( outlier tags ). Outlier tags cause a relevant increase of variance scores and they are likely to reflect personal events in the lives of users and provide a small amount of information. For in-stance, the most popular tag in Flickr is 2010 (it appears 51,726 times) and other popu-lar tags are vacation (43,993 times), family (41,995 times) and wedding (37,381 times). The variance plot for Delicious and Flickr resembles a cloud of point, whereas the StumbleUpon plot is a set of stripes of points. This is due to the specific goal of tagging in StumbleUpon: in fact, in Delicious or Flickr users are allowed to freely type tags or select a tag among those provided by other users and recommended by the system. StumbleUpon, by contrast, provides users with suggestions about categories of tags to use: so, for instance, while in Delicious a user is allowed to apply tags like Java or C++ (which are regarded as independent), in StumbleUpon there is a unifying category of tags (e.g., technology ). This reduces the level of variability in tag usage and, ultimately, the variance of tagging. We study the relationships between the tagging activity of a user in a Social Sharing system and the tagging activity of her friends. Our ultimate goal is to determine if there exists a correlation between the number of different tags (i.e., the variety) applied by a given user and the variety of tags applied by her social contacts. Also for this experiment we considered only Flickr and Delicious, given the absence of friending features in StumbleUpon.

We define a random variable X , which returns the number of friends of a given user who have applied more tags than her. We can graphically represent this result by plotting the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) F X ( x )of X , that is, the probability that X exceeds a fixed threshold value x : F X ( x ) = P ( X &gt; x ).

The CDF has been calculated as follows: first of all, for each Flickr and Delicious profile, we calculated the overall number of tags she assigned onto the platform; then, the same operation has been performed for all her friends. For each user u , it has been evaluated how many of her friends have assigned more tags than u . Finally, these values have been normalized. This allowed us to compute the CDF F X ( u ), which is graphically reported in Figure 9.

From Figure 9, it emerges that the value of F X ( x ) is rather small both for Delicious and Flickr. Such a behavior is likely to be influenced by the heavy-tailed distribution in the frequency of tagging. In fact, since a large fraction of users tend to apply a small number of tags, we expect that, on average, the frequency of tagging of the users tends to flat around small and generally similar values. Therefore, the probability that a user has applied more tags than her friends is generally quite small.

In addition, the CDF in Delicious approaches 0 when x  X  300; by contrast, the decrease of the CDF in Flickr appears to be more soften and the it is close to 0 when x  X  580. This means that the chance that a user has applied more tags than her friends is more marked in Flickr than Delicious.

This behavior can be explained as follows: in Flickr there are several users who want to promote their contents by applying a large number of (often common) tags. For these users, the chance that their frequency of tagging is higher than that of their friends is quite high. By contrast, Delicious users apply tags because their main goal is to quickly find contents of their interest and tags make the retrieval of these contents easier. In such a case, the social aspect emerging in Flickr is less relevant than in Delicious and, therefore, there is a large number of users who apply less tags than their friends. In the following we summarize the main results reported in this section. (1) The entropy of the tag-based profiles depends very much on the Social Sharing (2) The vast majority of users tend to apply most of their tags in a uniform fashion (3) The variety of the tagging activities of a user is influenced by her friending
The previous findings can be explained as follows: in narrow folksonomies like Flickr tagging activities play a secondary role because users prefer spend their time in cul-tivating social relationships and tags are often perceived as a mean to promote the contents they generate. The main consequence is that user contributed tags cover some specific interests and, therefore, users tend to frequently apply a limited number of tags. This explains why, in general, tag-based profiles in Flickr feature lower values of entropy than Delicious ones.

An opposite behavior emerges in broad folksonomies: most of the user perceive tag-ging services as an actually relevant service and use tags to better organize the re-sources at their disposal. If a user diversifies her interest by posting/consumming resources of different types (e.g., she is interested both in Web pages about Computer Technology and Contemporary Art), then the tags she will contribute will reflect this diversification. This explains why tag-based profiled of Delicious users have a higher level of entropy than Flickr ones. In this section we analyze the semantics of tag-based profiles across different systems. To this purpose, we relate tags to ontological concepts such as DBpedia or WordNet entities and transform tag-based profiles into semantic profiles.

Such a mapping is useful to derive further insights into the topics composing a given user profile. To analyze the semantics of user profiles, we relate tags to ( i ) concepts of a lexical database ( WordNet ), and ( ii ) concepts of an encyclopedia ( DBpedia ). WordNet allows us to characterize the tagging behavior from a lexicographic point of view because it describes what language people use to annotate resources. DBpedia is useful to describe the ontological concepts (e.g., persons, events, and other things ) people refer to in their tagging activities. 7.1.1. WordNet Concepts. WordNet [Fellbaum 1998] is a lexical database that groups together words that have a similar meaning into categories, so-called synsets . WordNet concepts are grouped into 45 top level categories such as nouns describing plants, food or communication, or verbs describing perceptions or motions. Our procedure requires to map each tag in a user profile onto one of the 45 top level concepts of the WordNet synset hierarchy (cf. lexicographer files 1 ). Such a mapping can be successful (if we find a WordNet category corresponding to that tag) or not.

The degree of alignment of a tag-based user profile can be defined as the percentage of tags in the profile that can be mapped onto WordNet categories. We considered Social Sharing systems in a pairwise fashion and, for each user registered to both the two systems we computed the percentage of tags that have been successfully mapped onto WordNet categories. This procedure generated diagrams reported in Figures 10(a X  X ). So, for instance, in Figure 10(a) each dot represents a user u . The abscissa (resp., ordinate) of this dot is the percentage of tags in the Flickr (resp., Delicious) profile of u successfully mapped onto WordNet categories.

Figures 10(a X  X ) allow us to infer (1) to what extent a user applies proper words as tags that one can also find in dictionaries, and (2) whether this usage pattern is rather user-specific or depends (also) on the social tagging environment.

Figure 10(a) characterizes Flickr and Delicious user profiles and shows that the success of mapping tags to WordNet concepts varies strongly among the different user profiles. If the success would merely depend on the user then one would expect that the large majority of the dots would be plotted close to the diagonal line. In such a case, in fact, the percentage of successfully mapped tags in Delicious would be equal to the percentage of successfully mapped tags in Flickr. However, the figure reveals that, on average, 62.13% of the Delicious profile tags can be related to WordNet categories in comparison to 47.76% for Flickr profiles.
For StumbleUpon profiles, the percentage of successfully mapped tags is 81.3% or higher (see Figures 10(b) and 10(c)). Both figures indicate that the tag vocabulary people utilize in StumbleUpon seems to be less noisy than their vocabulary in Flickr or Delicious. This observation can be explained by the fact that people who annotate Web resources in StumbleUpon receive category-based tagging suggestions. For example, they can select from categories such as entertainment or technology , hence terms that are also contained in thesauri such as WordNet.

There are only a few users for whom the Flickr or Delicious profiles seem to feature less noise than their StumbleUpon profiles. The definition of noise depends on the application context. Here, we consider those tags that do not appear in thesauri such as WordNet as noise. Indeed, those tags might still be of interest to certain applications that consume tag-based user profiles. Therefore, in the following we investigate tags related to ontological concepts (DBpedia resources). 7.1.2. DBpedia Concepts. DBpedia [Auer et al. 2007] provides RDF representations for the majority of concepts that are explained in the Wikipedia encyclopedia. DBpedia concepts are classified according to the DBpedia ontology, 2 which features more than 50 classes such as Person , Place or Work . To relate tag-based profiles to DBPedia concepts, we exploit three named entity recognition services: DBpedia Spotlight, 3 Alchemy 4 and OpenCalais. 5 These services detect entities in a given text snippet and link the identified entities to ontological concepts (e.g., DBPedia concepts) if possible. In our analysis, we serialize a tag-based profile to a document and then process the document via the different services. We aggregate the entities extracted from these services to increase the recall of detected entities. The accuracy of the named entity extraction varies slightly among the services. For example, tested on a news corpora from New York Times , Mendes et al. [2011] report about precision for Alchemy and DBpedia spotlight that ranges between 70% and 80%.

In Figures 10(d X  X ) we plot the fraction of tags that can be mapped onto DBpedia resources. The meaning of these diagrams is as follows: we considered Social Sharing systems in a pairwise fashion and each dot identifies a user. The abscissa (resp., or-dinate) of a dot is the percentage of tags in the user profile associated with the first (resp., the second) Social Sharing system successfully mapped onto a DBPedia concept. Results emerging from Figures 10(d X  X ) confirm our results in the context of the WordNet analysis. Delicious and StumbleUpon profiles allow for better alignment with ontological concepts than tag-based Flickr profiles. On average, we observe that 41.1% of the tags in a Flickr profile can be matched with a DBpedia entity. For Delicious and StumbleUpon profiles, this fraction raises to 61.5% and 80.9%, respectively.
However, as indicated in Figure 10(d), there are some users (3% of all Flickr users) for whom all elements in the tag-based Flickr profiles can be mapped onto DBpedia concepts. For these users, we observe that their tagging vocabulary is very limited because it consists, on average, of only 2.55 distinct tags. Figure 10(e) reveals that there is a similar behavior on StumbleUpon: for 15.6% of the StumbeUpon profiles we find that 100% of the tags in these profiles have a match on DBpedia. The average size of the corresponding profiles is again small and contains, on average, only 8.43 distinct tags.
Moreover, Figures 10(d X  X ) indicate that the tagging behavior of a user varies across the different tagging environments. For example, if a user in Delicious, applies tags, which can be successfully aligned with semantic concepts from DBpedia, then this does not necessarily imply a similar behavior in Flickr. In order to study the thematic variety of user profiles, we analyze the usage char-acteristics with respect to the different types of concepts that relate to users tagging activities. We utilize again variance (cf. Section 6.2) as a measure to quantify whether a user often refers to the same concept types and topics (low variance) or, vice versa, whether her tagging activities relate to multiple topics (high variance). The sample variance  X  C , u describing the variety of topics C to which a user u refers is
Here, C u is the set of distinct concept types that relate to at least one of the tags provided by u . The frequency f u ( c j ) denotes the number of tags contributed by u that are related to a topic c j and  X  C , u is the average number of tags per topic.
To detect topics we used both WordNet and DBPedia. 7.2.1. WordNet Concept Types. In Figures 11(a X  X ) we compared the variance in the topic usage by mapping user tags onto WordNet categories.

Figures 11(a X  X ) indicate that there is no significant difference between the topic varieties of user profiles in Flickr and Delicious. In fact, for 53.3% of the users, the topic variety of their Flickr profiles is higher than the ones of their Delicious profiles while for 46.7% it is the vice versa.
 It is interesting to observe that the individual behavior differs across the systems. For example, some users are concerned with various types of topics in Flickr but only with a few types of topics in Delicious or vice versa.

Between Flickr and Delicious the differences in the design of the tagging environ-ments do not seem to impact the variety of the types of concepts people refer to in their tagging activities. However, as depicted in Figure 11(b) and Figure 11(c), the Stumble-Upon environment seems to influence the tagging behavior from a thematic point of view, stronger than the individual usage preferences of a user. About 64% of the people feature more diversity in their Flickr profiles in comparison to their StumbleUpon pro-file. When comparing StumbleUpon and Delicious profiles, we observe that even more than 70% of the users reveal more diverse topics in the Delicious profile that was not generated in StumbleUpon. 7.2.2. DBpedia Concept Types. In Figures 11(d X  X ) we studied the variance in the topic usage by mapping user tags onto DBpedia concepts. These results clearly differ from previous results based on WordNet categories.

Overall, we observe that the variance is much smaller compared to variance measured for the WordNet categories. On average, the variance with respect to the types of DBpedia concepts referenced by the users is 5.9 (Flickr), 249.6 (Delicious) and 78.9 (StumbleUpon). By contrast, the analysis of the usage variety of WordNet categories revealed, on average, a variance of 2080.9 (Flickr), 721.9 (Delicious) and 287.6 (StumbleUpon) for these services. We observe that regarding the usage of ontological concepts (DBpedia), the tagging behavior is X  X ndependently of the Social Sharing system X  X ore uniform than the lexicographic dimension (WordNet). Hence, the language that people use to describe resources varies more strongly than the types of concepts to which they refer.

Furthermore, the comparison of the tagging behavior across the different tagging environments leads to new insights. For example, while the variety of the language differs only slightly between Flickr and Delicious (see Figure 11(a)), we discover that the variety of ontological concepts that people refer to strongly differs across these two platforms as well as between Flickr and StumbleUpon. On Flickr, the variance of concept types is X  X or the majority of the users X  X uch smaller than on Delicious or StumbleUpon (see Figure 11(d) and Figure 11(e)), which indicates that, from an onto-logical point of view, the tagging behavior is more uniform on Flickr than on Delicious or StumbleUpon. The ontological analysis refines the insights from the lexicographic analysis: there exists a large variety of lexicographic concepts to describe pictures on Flickr but the variety of the ontological concepts that people refer to is smaller in Flickr and much broader on Delicious and StumbleUpon. The semantic analysis revealed how the tagging behavior of users differs across Social Sharing platforms with respect to the lexicographic and ontological dimension. In summary, we can answer the research questions raised as follows. (1) Semantic concepts can be successfully inferred from the tag-based profiles of the (2) The semantic variety of user profiles clearly differs across Social Sharing platforms.
A possible explanation is that users can apply different tags that are related to the same topic. The number of topics is much less than the number of tags and, then, we expect that the deviation on the number of topics a user focuses on and the average number of topics per user is small. This explains the low variance in topic distribution. Of course, two different users can focus on the same topics but they can use different tags referring to the same topic. Due to the homophily principle, it is likely that users sharing some interests can get in touch/become friends and expand their vocabularies by absorbing the tags applied by other users. Therefore, we are not surprised at the existence of users who applied a number of tags that is much higher or much lower than the average number of tags per user. This behavior has been already highlighted in Figure 1 in which a right-skewed distribution emerged in tag frequency assignment and this explains why, at the tag level, we are in presence of a high variety. In this section we discuss how the findings of this work can be used in practical scenarios.

The analysis carried out in this article showed that the design features and the goals of a Social Sharing system can influence the profile of a user. In the following we shall consider only the tagging behavior of a user because user-contributed tags can be used to infer user preferences. Due to these reasons, given a user u affiliated to multiple each system. We can expect that there are some user preferences/features that are recurrent across all profiles, whereas there is other information that is present only in one or few profiles. Therefore, each profile P i T can be decomposed into two components called persistent and contingent components.

The persistent component reflects user preferences that are present in multiple profiles of u , and, therefore, are independent of the specific platform to which a user is registered. The contingent component denotes preferences of u that are distinctive of a specific platform and that are not present in other platforms; therefore, these preferences depend on the specific goals and design of the platform itself.
The decomposition into persistent/contingent components has many practical appli-cations which, are detailed in the following.

Merging of User Profiles . Some authors studied how to merge the tags contributed by users in different platforms to build a global user profile [Szomszor et al. 2008]. Users may apply different tags to describe the same concept ( synomymous tags ) and, therefore, tag alignment techniques to detect and merge synonymous tags are required. In these approaches, the fact that a tag may be occasionally applied in a platform or, by contrast, it identifies a user interest stated in multiple platform, is neglected. Therefore, we can think of more refined procedures to merge user profiles in which the persistent and contingent components are identified; after that, we can think of merging only the contingent components.

Dealing with the Cold Start Problem . A relevant application of our findings is in the area of Recommender Systems and it is related to the ability of effectively dealing with the cold start problem . Such a problem arises each time a user u subscribes for the first time to a system and her profile is empty. In such a case it is not possible to provide u with personalized recommendations. Tags in the persistent component of the profile of u represent well-defined user preferences and they can be used to recommend contents to u . Such a knowledge is particularly useful in the context of content-based recommender systems [De Gemmis et al. 2008] because we can use tags in the persistent component as a form of bootstrap knowledge . In particular, we envision the possibility of comparing the tags describing a resource with the tags in the persistent profile of u to determine whether such a resource may be of interest to u .

Computing User Similarities . Since the inception of Collaborative Filtering tech-niques, many authors studied the problem of computing the similarity degree of two users. Such a problem has been recently considered in the context of folksonomies [De Meo et al. 2010]. In these approaches the computation of the similarity degree of two users is translated to the computation of the similarity of the tags appearing in their profiles.

As shown in Section 2.1, tags can be weighted and the weight of a tag reflects its relevance in defining user interests. Tag weights could be used to compute in a more precise fashions pairs (or groups) of similar users [De Meo et al. 2010].

If a user u enters for the first time in a new Social Sharing system, her tag-based profile is empty and we can not identify her neighborhoods and use the information they contributed to recommend resources to u . We propose to use tags in the persistent component of the profile of u along with their weights to identify groups of similar users: in particular, given a Social Sharing system S i ,andauser v in S i , we suggest to compare the tags (and their weights) in the profile of v with the tags (and associated weights) in the persistent component of the profile of u to determine the similarity degree of u and v .

To compute the weight of a tag t we assume that a tag-ranking algorithm R is available and that R associates each tag t with a weight w t . After this we consider two cases: in the former case u has applied t in exactly one of the available Social Sharing systems, say S i . In this case t is part of the contingent component of the profile of u and its weight is equal to w i ( t ) = R ( t ); here the subscript i informsusthat t appeared in S i .
In the latter case, we suppose that u has applied t in more than one Social Sharing systems (or in more than a certain number). In such a case t can be regarded as part of the persistent component of the profile of u . More formally, a threshold  X  can be experimentally defined and we say that t is part of the persistent component of the profile of u if it has been exploited by u in at least  X  Social Sharing systems. In this case we associate t with an array w = [ w 1 ( t ) ,...,w n ( t )] and each w i ( t ) is computed as in the former case. Of course w i ( t ) = 0if t does not appear in S i . The weight associated with t can be computed by aggregating w 1 ( t ) ,...,w n ( t ) into a global value. There are several strategies to aggregate weights and some of them have been extensively studied in the field of contextual recommender systems : for instance, we can use operators like avg and sum [Adomavicius et al. 2005]. Research related to social network analysis and social tagging acquired a lot of atten-tion during the last decade. In this article, we focused on the analysis of individual user profiles that can be inferred from social networking and tagging activities and studied the characteristics of these profiles across system boundaries. Our findings are of particular interest to generic user modeling systems,that aim to re-use profile information in different application contexts.

In this section, we discuss related literature from three main perspectives: (i) the analysis of user data that is distributed across Social Web systems, (ii) the problem of identifying users on the Social Web and (iii) approaches to interpreting the semantics of tags and categorize them. In the latest years many researchers studied how to aggregate data coming from disparate Social Web systems with the goal of enhancing the level of personalization offered to the end users [Shi et al. 2011; Abel et al. 2011] or improve the description of Web resources [Stewart et al. 2009].

To the best of our knowledge, one of the first approaches targeting at merging data residing on different folksonomies is the already mentioned work by [Szomszor et al. 2008].

While the approach of [Szomszor et al. 2008] focuses on the construction of global user profiles, other authors observe that the process of aggregating tagging data can be beneficial not only to produce more detailed user profiles but also to better describe resources available in a Social Web system. A relevant example is provided in Stewart et al. [2009]; in that paper the authors consider users of blogs concerning music and users of Last.fm , a popular folksonomy whose resources are musical tracks. The ultimate goal of Stewart et al. [2009] is to enrich each Social Web system by reusing tags already exploited in other environments. This activity has a twofold effect: it first allows the automatic annotation of resources that were not originally labeled and, then, enriches user profiles in such a way that user similarities can be computed in a more precise way.

Starting from the findings of Szomszor et al. [2008] and Stewart et al. [2009], many researchers studied how to get real benefits from the aggregation of social data. A popular research trend consists of exploiting aggregated social data to generate high quality recommendations. For instance, Shi et al. [2011], suggest to use tags present in different Social Web systems to establish links between items located in each system. De Meo et al. [2009a] show how to merge ratings provided by users in different Social Web platforms to compute reputation values (which are subsequently used to generate recommendations).

Abel et al. [2011] the system Mypes is presented. Mypes supports the linkage, aggre-gation, alignment and semantic enrichment of user profiles available in various Social Web systems, such as Flickr, Delicious and Facebook.

The approaches presented in this section neglect social relationships whereas, in our approach, the social and tagging behavior of a user play an equally relevant role to infer user preferences. Due to these reasons, in this article we did not investigate new techniques for recommending items/tags in social system (which is the core of another research line [De Meo et al. 2011]), but aimed at finding potential form of correlation between the social and the tagging behavior of a user. Recently, some authors focused on the problem of matching the multiple accounts created by a user in different Social Web systems ( user identification ). Such a research line can be considered complimentary to ours because some authors observed that the analysis of the tag-based user profiles in different systems is useful to reveal whether two user accounts refer to the same user or not [Iofciu et al. 2011]. This kind of analysis resembles the empirical analysis on tag-based profiles presented in this article.
To the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to match user identities was proposed in Carmagnola and Cena [2009]. In that paper, the authors performed an in-depth analysis of 25 adaptive systems with the goal of identifying what user profile attributes were frequently recurrent in each system; the outcome of such an analysis led to isolate attributes like username, name, location and e-mail address.

More recently, other authors studied the problem of user identification in the context of Social Networks. One of the first studies was proposed in Vosecky et al. [2009]. In that paper the authors focused on Facebook and StudiVZ 6 and investigated which profile attributes can be used to identify users.
 Zafarani and Liu [2009], studied 12 different Social Web systems (like Delicious, Flickr and YouTube) with the goal of finding a mapping with the different user accounts. This mapping can be found by applying a traditional search engine.

Iofciu et al. [2011], suggest to combine profile attributes (like usernames) with an analysis of the tags contributed by them to identify users. They suggest various strate-gies to compare the tag-based profiles of two users. Experiments provided in Iofciu et al. [2011] are able to achieve an accuracy of almost 80% in user identification. Our work introduces some novelties against the approaches presented in this section. First of all, we suggest that social relationships can be considered a precious source of information about users; by contrast, the approaches mentioned before focus on tagging as the only kind of information about users. As a further difference, in our approach we analyze tagging behavior at the semantic level because we map tags onto concepts through DBPedia/WordNet and we do not limit to consider only the tagging frequency. Recently, some authors introduced the problem of tag categorization ,thatis,they studied how to classify tags into (often predefined) categories [Cantador et al. 2011; De Gemmis et al. 2008; De Meo et al. 2009b; Schmitz 2006; Wu et al. 2006].
The main motivation behind these work is that many tags are not effective to help users in retrieving and recommending resources: in fact, sometimes, tags reflect per-sonal opinions/moods of users (think of tags like  X  beauty  X  X r X  smart  X ) and, therefore, they do not provide a relevant contribution to retrieve contents. Some authors sug-gested to partition the whole space of tags into categories; the association of a tag to a category allows to better interpret the meaning of a tag and decide if it is useful to de-scribe a resource. An interesting approach to categorizing tags is provided in Cantador et al. [2011]. In that paper, external knowledge bases like WordNet or Wikipedia are used to determine how to map tags onto concepts. The authors suggest to use heuris-tics derived from Natural Language Processing to identify tags expressing subjective facts rather than providing the objective description of a resource. Angeletou et al. [2009] experimentally studied whether WordNet and online ontologies can improve the search activity over a folksonomy. Experiments showed that WordNet was better than online ontologies to deal with tag synonymies (i.e, different tags sharing the same meaning) and tag polysemy (i.e., the fact that a tag can have different meanings). By contrast, ontologies were more effective than WordNet in finding objects of interest to the user: in particular, the expansion of a user query with terms coming from an on-tology generated a higher number of results than those produced by exploiting terms found in WordNet. Pan et al. [2009], describe an approach to supporting search in folksonomies. In particular, the approach of Pan et al. [2009] uses ontologies to deal with tag ambiguity and expand user queries. Experimental trials reported in Pan et al. [2009] are in line with the findings of Angeletou et al. [2009], that is, ontology-based query expansion is actually able of improving the quality of search results: In addi-tion, ontologies are transparent to the user and this enable non-trained users to use ontologies.

Our work share some similarities with approaches to categorizing tags because we mapped user contributed tags onto DBPedia concepts to better interpret their meaning. Such a mapping induces a partitioning of the tags space in which each partition is identified by an ontological concept in DBPedia.

De Gemmis et al. [2008] show how to effectively combine a content-based recom-mender algorithm with tags. User profiles are learned by applying a multivariate Pois-son model exploited for performing text classification. The proposed algorithm works both on static content, that is, the description of items provided by the Web site and on tags contributed by users to freely annotate items. The authors observe that tags may suffer from some main syntactic problems like polysemy and synonymy. To deal with these problems the authors suggest to use Natural Language Processing techniques and, in particular, Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). The WSD strategy adopted in De Gemmis et al. [2008] relies on WordNet.

Other approaches rely on Data Mining techniques to find groups of related tags in a folksonomy and each group identifies a category. For instance, the approach of Wu et al. [2006] defines a vectorial space called conceptual space whose dimensions represent knowledge categories; each entity of a folksonomy (i.e., a user, a resource, a tag) is a vector on this conceptual space. Conceptual space has many applications ranging from the construction of groups of related tags to the accomplishment of semantic search in a folksonomy.

The approach of Begelman et al. [2006] first models the tag space as an undirected graph whose nodes represent tags and whose edges denote cooccurrences of tags in labelling resources. After this graph has been constructed, a spectral clustering algo-rithm is applied to partition it into non-overlapping groups of semantically related tags.

Finally, some authors proposed hierarchical classification schemes to partition the tag space. One of the early approaches in this category is presented in Schmitz [2006]. In that paper, the author proposes a probabilistic framework to model subsumption relationships among tags.

Finally, De Meo et al. [2009b], describe a technique to build a hierarchy of tags in a folksonomy. First of all, they define a probabilistic technique to assess if two tags present related meanings or if the meaning of the first one is more general than that of the second one. After that, they suggest a greedy algorithm to arrange these tags into a hierarchy. In this article, we investigated tagging and social networking (friending) behavior of in-dividual users across different Social Sharing platforms. We studied the characteristics of user profiles from Flickr, Delicious and StumbleUpon with respect to three different dimensions: (i) intensity of user activities, (ii) tag-based characteristics of user profiles and (iii) semantic characteristics of user profiles. Based on our extensive analysis and the corresponding findings, we can answer the research questions raised in Section 3 as follows.

Influence of the features of a Social Sharing platform on user behaviors. We stud-ied to what extent the design and architecture of the social environment influences the characteristics of the user profiles and to what extent the personality of a user determine the features of the corresponding profiles. This led to formulate research questions Q 1  X  Q 3 (reported as follows):  X  Q 1 . Does the intensity of user activities carried out by a user in a Social Sharing system
S depend on the features of the platform? We studied how much the design features of a Social Sharing platform impacted on the social and tagging behaviors of its users. From our analysis, Flickr fosters higher involvement in friending activities than
Delicious. Moreover, the goal of the tagging functionality has a significant impact on the tagging behavior: for instance, regarding StumbleUpon, the intensity of tagging activities is, on average, lower than the intensity of the tagging in Flickr or Delicious.
By contrast, this difference does not emerge in Flickr and Delicious: in particular, users who are highly active in Delicious may also be highly active in Flickr but there is a high fraction of users that is highly active in either one of the two environments.  X  Q 2 . Does the variety of tags exploited by a user depend on the features of the Social
Sharing system in which she is operating. For most users, the variety of the tags they contribute is similar across the different Social Sharing systems. By measuring the entropy of a user X  X  tag-based profiles in the different systems, we discovered that the variety of information that is embodied in the profiles depends very much on the
Social Sharing platform. For the majority of the users, the entropy of the Delicious profile is higher than the entropy of StumbleUpon or Flickr profile and this makes tagging behavior in Delicious much more unpredictable than that on StumbleUpon or Flickr.  X  Q 3 . How does the variety of topics a user is concerned with depend on the features and goals of a Social Sharing platform? The semantic analysis of the tag-based profiles proved that the topic variety of user profiles clearly differs across Social
Sharing platforms. By mapping tags onto lexicographic and ontological concepts, we discovered that the variety of the lexicographic concepts (i.e., the language that people use to annotate their resources) does not strongly vary between environments such as Flickr and Delicious. However, the category-like tag suggestions as offered by StumbleUpon result in a lower lexicographic variety. When looking at the actual topics that people are concerned with in the different Social Sharing platforms (variety of ontological concepts), we see strong differences between the environments that complement the tag-based and lexicographic analysis: on Flickr we observe a more uniform behavior than on Delicious and StumbleUpon.

Correlations between tagging behavior and friending behavior. We also studied the interplay between tagging and friending activities. This led to formulate research questions Q 4 and Q 5 (reported as follows).  X  Q 4 . Does the intensity of the activity a user carries out in a Social Sharing system depend on the type of activity? Our analysis showed that there are correlations be-tween the intensity of tagging and friending activities. For Flickr, we observe that a low tagging activity often implies also a low number of social interactions (and vice versa) while users who intensively tag show also a solid intensity regarding their friending activities (and vice versa). By contrast, in Delicious, the intensity of tagging activities is generally larger than the intensity of friending, which im-plies that the architecture of Delicious is not targeted towards social networking activities.  X  Q 5 . Does the variety of tags a user exploits correlate with the number of her social contacts? On Flickr, the variety of the tags contributed by a user is influenced by her friending activities. We identified users who apply a large number of (often common) tags (possibly to better promote and increase the visibility of their photos).
This behavior may result from the tagging design of Flickr, which implies a narrow folksonomy and thus forces users to annotate the resources without help of fellow users. On Delicious, which allows for collaborative tagging, we did not discover such a correlation.

The results of our analysis show how the design and architecture of Social Sharing platforms may influence the tagging and friending behavior of people. Our results also pose challenges for future research and pave the way to the development of practical applications.

We plan to extend our cross-system analysis to further systems and types of activ-ities. In particular, we would like to study whether there exist correlations between microblogging activities that people perform on Twitter and their tagging and friending activities in Flickr or Delicious.

A major research avenue we plan to explore is given by the analysis of external factors and their impact on user behaviors and choices. As external factor we consider, for example, the  X  X ge X  of a system, the system a user joined first and how long a user has been on a system. This would allow us to better understand user behaviors we started analyzing in this article as well as to formulate new research questions. For instance, could we define and measure the  X  X oyalty X  of a user? In other words, assume a user joins first Delicious and after some months/weeks Flickr. Our questions are: will she continue spending the largest part of her time on the Web on Delicious or not? Will she spend time equally between Delicious and Flickr? Is there a portion of users who will prefer to dedicate their time to Flickr despite the joined first Delicious? In addition, if a user joins first Delicious and then Flickr, do some differences emerge in her tagging/social behavior? Would such a result change if we would swap Delicious and Flickr (i.e., if we would consider users who join Delicious first and then Flickr)? Is the level of user activities in a platform related to the popularity of the contents hosted in that platform? For instance, if in Flickr are added photos capable of catching the interest of large masses of users, will these new materials increase the level of user participation?
In addition, we are also interested in investigating relationships between static profile attributes that can be found in Facebook or LinkedIn profiles (such as the profession or age of a user) and the characteristics of tag-based and social profiles.
Finally, we plan to use tag categorization techniques to improve the results of our analysis. In particular, tag categorization techniques are useful to identify those tags that support knowledge management and that can be exploited for information re-trieval purposes from those reflecting user moods (or their subjective opinions).
