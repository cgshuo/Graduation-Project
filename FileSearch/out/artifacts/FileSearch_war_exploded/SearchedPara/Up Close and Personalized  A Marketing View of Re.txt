 Developments in the marketing literature on recommendation systems are reviewed and an illustration of an Adaptive Personalization System is provided in the context of music. This illustration reveals that Adaptiv e Personalization Systems have the potential to significantly increase the effectiveness of personal recommendations, and perform better than extant methods.

Michel Wedel is the Pepsico Prof essor of Consumer Science at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland. The marketing literature has focused on the development of personalization systems that are based on a fundamental understanding of consumer behavior , and the representation of consumer heterogeneity of the need for products and acceptance of recommendations. Personaliza tion of marketing control variables, such as price and co mmunication, has proven effective, but companies increasingly turn to personalization of products and services themselves as well. Most still rely on self-personalization of products by consumers, where the online channel has played an important role. Personalization needs to be based on a deep understanding of the differences in needs and wants of individual consumers. Therefore, the development of personalization approaches in th e marketing often involves the development and application of co mprehensive statistical models accommodating consumers' rating scale usage behavior, unwillingness to provide data input, and lack of responsiveness to recommendations, has recently spawned the development of Adaptive Personalization Systems (APS). These systems are based on unobtrusively collected purchase or usage history data, and learn customers X  preferences and tastes adaptively over time. APS require minimal proactive user input, and adapt their personalization better as more in formation becomes available on an individual consumer, to improve personalization effectiveness. applications. The system consists of an adaptive personalization agent that analyzes individual-le vel listening behavior on mobile devices. It uses collaborative cust omization to further tailor play-lists to individual tastes. At the same time, it promotes serendipity and circumvents locki ng in on a too narrow set of user tastes by enabling surprise in the recommendations. It requires very little proactive user effort. Th e main features of the system include: an individual level hazard model is used to estimate an individual X  X  music tastes from the time s/he spent listening to each song; a particle filter for sel ecting predictor variables and updating the individual-level hazard model parameters in real time as new data come in; a model averaging procedure in which models of different individuals are averaged; and, an optimal sequential experimental design pro cedure to generate customized play-lists based on the estimat es of individual consumer preferences. The Adaptive Personalization System is implementable because of its scalability accomplished through the particle filter, which offloads pa rt of the computational burden to individuals X  own mobile music devices. A pilot implementation on Palm PDAs among close to 100 respondents shows that compared to alternative systems, the proposed system leads to a greater number of songs listened to and songs listened to longer, while minimizing required user involvement in downloading and managing play-lists. found their way into practice. They hold promise also as a topic for future academic research. Several issues are of interest. First, a number of behavioral/psychological phenomena are pertinent to both personalization of products of services, and their acceptance by consumers. For example, personalization may strongly be influenced by the usage context, both by the physical context, the (virtual) social context and the specific set and sequence of products and services consum er in them. Also, a better understanding of how and why consumer preferences change over time, possibly in response to the recommendations they receive, is needed and can be capitalized upon. Further advances in theory-based modeling are needed to incorporate these phenomena into
