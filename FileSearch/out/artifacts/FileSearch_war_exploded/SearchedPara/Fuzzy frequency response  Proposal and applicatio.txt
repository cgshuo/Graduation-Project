 1. Introduction
The design of control systems is currently driven by a large number of requirements posed by increasing competition, envir-onmental requirements, energy and material costs and the this context, the analysis and synthesis of compensators are system. In the design, the compensators are obtained to attend the desired characteristics of the control system from certain acteristics and sensitivity to parameter changes in the plant Sun, 1996 ).

One way to analyze the dynamic behavior of a real world system frequency response analysis describes how a dynamic system 1994 ; Serra et al., 2009 ; Tanaka et al., 1998 ).

The sum of the normalized activation degrees is equal to 1, as demonstrated in Eq. (9). To define the points of this fuzzy polytopic geometric shape, each rule of the TS fuzzy dynamic model must be individually activated. This condition is called the fuzzy frequency response (FFR) of the TS fuzzy transfer function:
If only the rule 1 is activated , it has  X  g 1  X  1 , g 2  X  0 , ... , g l  X  0  X  . Hence , W  X  j o , ~ n  X  X

This section analyzed the behavior of the fuzzy frequency response at low and high frequencies. The idea is to study the magnitude and phase behavior of the TS fuzzy dynamic model, when o varies from zero to infinity. 4.1. Low frequency analysis
Low frequency analysis of the TS fuzzy dynamic model ~ W  X  s  X  can be obtained by lim The magnitude and phase behaviors at low frequencies are given by lim 4.2. High frequency analysis
Likewise, the high frequency analysis of the TS fuzzy dynamic model ~ W  X  s  X  can be obtained by lim
The magnitude and phase behaviors at high frequencies are given by lim 5. Computational results To illustrate the FFR: definition and analysis, as shown in
Sections 3 and 4, consider the following uncertain dynamic system, given by

A comparative analysis, via analog simulation between the uncertain dynamic system equation (40) and the TS fuzzy dynamic model equation (37), can be performed to validate the
TS fuzzy dynamic model. A band-limited white noise (normally distributed random signal) was considered as input and the uncertainty was based on sinusoidal variation. As shown in represent the dynamic behavior of the uncertain dynamic system in the time domain can be seen.

So,

Starting from the TS fuzzy dynamic model, Eq. (41), and dynamic system can be obtained as follows: lim
As o tends to zero, Eq. (46) can be approximated as follows: lim
Hence lim
Applying Theorem 3.1, proposed in Section 3, the obtained low frequencies, presents a magnitude range in the interval [0;6.0206] dB and the phase is 0 1 .

From Table 1 , it can be concluded that the fuzzy frequency response of the uncertain dynamic system, at low frequencies, presents a range of magnitude in the interval [0,6] dB and the phase is 0 1 , as shown in Fig. 8 . 5.2. High frequency analysis
Likewise, starting from the TS fuzzy dynamic model, Eq. (41), and now applying the concepts seen in Section 4.2, the steady-uncertain dynamic system can be obtained as follows: lim in the TS fuzzy dynamic model increase more rapidly than the other ones. Thus, lim + arctan 2 g 1 0 : 6  X  j o  X 
Hence lim ~
