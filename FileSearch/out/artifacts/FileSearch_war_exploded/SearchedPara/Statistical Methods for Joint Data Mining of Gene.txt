 One of the purposes of microarray gene expression experiments is to identify genes regulated under specific cellular conditions. With the availability of putative transcription factor binding motifs, it is now possible to relate gene expression pattern to the pattern of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), as well as study how TF BS interact with each other to control gene system atic approach for com bining data from microarray gene expression experiments and th e corresponding regulatory motif patterns in order to delineate gene regulation mechanisms. A secondary goal is to develop a predictive model for finding similarly regulated genes . Three cons ecutive procedures are proposed for such data m ining activities. First, a linear mixed-effect m odel is fit to data from microarray gene expression experim ents and potential regulated (positive) genes are identified based on a specific biological hy pothesis. Putative TFBS are then retrieved for the identified positive genes and random ly selected controls. Second, a cluster an aly sis is conducted to reduce collinearity am ong the binding sites. In the third step, logistic regression is applied to choose the best model to predict gene type (positive, control) based on the num erous TFBS predictors. The above approach was applied to an internal example and a model was developed to predict up-re gulated genes in activated T -helper ( Th ) cells. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme, the model has an 18.9% false positive rate and a 41.7% false negative rate.
 Microarray , transcription factor binding site (TFBS), cluster analy sis, logistic regression, modeling, regulatory motifs, T -helper cells. The activation or repression of gene transcription in a eukary otic genome involves binding of DNA se quences by transcription factors (regulatory proteins). These binding sites are array ed within several hundred base pairs predominantly upstream from the Transcription Start Site (TSS) in the prom oter [1] . Identify ing regulatory regions with transcription characteristics and then finding potential TFBS, which may interact or directly contribute to the specific gene expression, con tinues to be a challenge. It is im portant to find a powerful m ethod to accom plish these goals. Research has been conducted to propose several methods for identify ing regulatory genes impor tant to cell expression, for cluster analy sis of expression data and TFBS data, and for identify ing putative TFBS. Analy zing the expression data first to identify particular genes before th e TF BS data analy sis has been proposed, as well as usi ng TFBS data to predict expression levels. We now proceed to describe a fe w of these statistical m ethods. Pilpel, et al. s creened genom ic s equences agains t a databas e of known and putative motifs (or significant TFBS) to identify genes that contain the m otifs [2] . This inform ation is then m odeled to calculate the effect of the m otifs on gene expres sion. F or each motif, an expres sion coherence s core is calculated to m eas ure how sim ilar the genes are with that motif using expression profiles. Caselle, et al. presented a novel computational method to identify regulatory elem ents in the ups tream region of eukary otic genes [3] . The genes are clustered based on an overrepresented motif, the average expres sion level is dete rm ined, and then if the level is higher or lower than the whole genom e average, the m otif is likely responsible. Most recently , Conlon et al. proposed MOTIF REGRESSOR for discovering sequence motifs upstr eam of genes that undergo expression changes in a given condition [4] . The genes are initially ranked by expression and the DNA sequence upstream from thes e genes is selected. They us ed M otif Dis covery scan or MDscan [5] to independently identify candidate m otifs and then scored the given sequences by the number of motif matches to the MDscan output. Insignificant motifs were removed using a simple linear regression between the score and gene expression and significant motifs were grouped based on a stepwise regression analy sis. In this study , we propose to use microarray gene expression profiling experiments to identify potential regulated genes, based on similar expression profiles in distinct subsets of human T -helper ( Th ) cells. W e will develop a m odel to predict up-regulated genes in activated Th cells based on the pattern of appearance of TFBS from expression data. Th cells are a subs et of T -cells that carry the T4 marker and are essential for turning on antibody production, activating cy totoxic T -cells and initiating other immune responses [6] . They can be divided into 3 subsets based on their cy tokine secretion profiles. Ty pe 1 ( Th1 ) cells predom inantly secrete IL-1, IL -2, TNF-beta, and IFN-gamma. The secretion of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13 characterizes type 2 ( Th2 ) cell responses. The last set, referred to as Th0 , can produce both a Th1 -and Th2 -ty pe cy tokine, s o they are not clearly differentiated from the others. DNA microarray s, consisting of thousands of individual gene sequences printed in a high-density array on a glass microscope slide, provide a practical and economi cal tool for study ing gene expression on a very large scale [7] . Expression analy sis using microarray s is conducted by iden tify ing changes in mRNA levels. The mRNA from cell sam ples is used to conduct gene-profiling experim ents with chip analy sis, m ost often with Affy metrix GeneChip  X  array s. The experim ents or s cans repres ent a com bination of different factors with res ults collected for a large number of genes. From cord blood samples, these factors are cell types ( Th0, Th1, Th2 ) from different donors (A, B, C), maintained res ting or activated (cell action). Linear mixed effect m odeling will be used to analy ze the microarray data and detect genes that are positive for a particular cell expression. Coupled with a set of genes determined to be unexpressed in these cells, we have a set of positive training samples and negative (control) training samples. Using the inform ation of putative TFBS in the promoter region of these genes, we propose to use a logis tic regression model to identify im portant binding sites to differentiate positive genes from negative genes. Furthermore, the developed model can be used to screen the whole genome to predict regulatory genes for a particular expression profile. Ty pically , expression data is normalized due to a number of reasons, including unequal quantities of starting RNA, differences in labeling or detection efficiencies between the fluores cent dy es used, and s ystem atic bias es in the m eas ured expres sion levels [8] . Scaling or norm alization will allo w inform ative com parisons of the expression levels to be made. Although median scaling is a popular method used in previous research [9,10,11] , we choose to normalize the data using a  X  X  edian-regres sion X  or piece-wis e linear regres sion (P LR) approach [12] . First, the median scan is found by calculating the median of all s cans for every gene. Each scan is then regres sed to the median scan and a s lope is es tim ated. Dividing each s can value by its corresponding slope normalizes the data. In order to identify genes 1 showing higher expression, we fit a mixed model to the norm alized data for each individual gene. A mixed model analy sis can be used in place of the s tandard linear model in this case, since we ar e assuming the sample donor is a random effect im pacting the variability of the data while all other random effect, and one interaction effect of interest, the model can be written as the following: where Y ijk represents the observation for the i and k th donor and  X  represents the overall mean (unknown fixed parameter). The fixed effect of the i th represented by parameters  X  i , and  X  j , respectively . The random effect of the k th donor,  X  k , has the distribution N (0, interaction between the fixed effects are repres ented by param eter (  X  X  ) ij and the experimental error (  X  ijk ) is distributed as N (0, This model can be eas ily expanded to accom modate m ore than two fixed effects and more than one interaction effect. At this stage, the term  X  X enes  X  is used instead of 'qualifiers' for ease of understanding. Fitting this m odel to the data allo ws statistical inferences to be made. To determine which ge nes have the most effect on expression levels, criteria for the significance of model parameters are set a priori . For our purposes, genes are selected as  X  positive X  if the m ain effect or interaction of chosen factor(s) are highly significant ( p &lt;0.0001) and selected as  X  X egative X  (or control) if the p -value is the leas t significant (0.6&lt; p &lt;1.0). The positive genes, showing highe r expression, and the control genes are m apped to Celera Hum an Trans cripts (hCTs ). For each hCT, we retrieved putative TF BS , which are located within  X  1.5 kilobases (kb) and +0.5 kb relative to the TSS and within a human-mouse conserved segmen t from Celera human TFBS database. Each hCT is mapped using The Transcription Factor Database, TRANSFAC [13] , and all high scoring ( p -value &lt; 2  X  10 -4 ) TFBS are retrieved. Since the goal of the final stage is to perform a logistic regression analy sis with the binary res ponse (1=positive gene, 0=negative gene) being dependent on the pres ence of the binding sites, filter criteria need to be defined to reduce the large number of predictors. Due to the sparseness of the data (i.e. large number of 0's), it is com mon for two predictors to display a linear relationship, when in fact the relationship is unknown. Filtering will reduce this occurrence. The first step in filtering the pred ictors is to choose binding sites appearing on a minimum number of genes. The criterion chosen did not appear on at least 1 gene, the site is deleted. If a TFBS is found in either the control data and not in the positive data or vice versa, the missing values are conve rted to zeros as the two data sets are com bined. Cluster analy sis can also reduce linear relationships or collinearity among binding sites. One of the biggest problems in regression modeling is collinearity , though in som e instances, collinearity can provide a great deal of useful inform ation. This is especially true for this study since collinearity can be due to redundant motifs (less inform ative) or sy nergistic m otifs (m ore inform ative). Redundant motifs could be two binding sites belonging to the same motif family at different positions or closely located based on their positioning. In both of thes e cas es, the m otifs are likely to be the same, but with the current statistical methods, we can only assum e collinearity . Sy nergistic or cooperative binding of factors is the sim ultaneous interac tions of two factors with closely situated target sites that can result in a non-additively high level of transcriptional activation [14] . We are hoping to find collinear binding sites, establish the ty pe of collinearity based on previous research, and combine the binding sites without discarding valuable inform ation. The TF BS are com pared pairwis e for s imilarity (either they appear on the gene (1) or do not appear on the gene (0)). For example, given N genes, if TF BS1 and TFBS2 both appear, only one appears, or neither appears on a given gene, the following 2  X  2 table can be constructed. Table 1: Counts for pair wise compar ison of binding site s In order to cluster the binding sites, sim ilarity ( S ) between a pair of TFBS is defined as the percentage of genes for which either both TFBS are present at its promot er region or neither present. Using the table above, the similarity percentage would be The significance level of the s core  X  2 for variable entry and the Wa ld  X  2 for variable elim ination for these two procedures is set at 0.10. The s ignificance level at this early stage is les s cons ervative to allow all possible significant effects to rem ain in the m odel. The variables exhibiting signi ficant m ain effects from both analy ses are kept in the m odel for the next s tep. Since we are working with sparse data, sim ilarity only tells half of the story . For instance, two bindi ng sites may be 98% similar, but only appear on 1 or 2 genes with the rest zeros. These variables are highly collinear, but m ostly due to sparseness. The num ber of times both TFBS appear on a given gene ( n 4 ) defines the more prevalent s ites . If we s et our clus ter criteria as a balance of S and n , a list of the m ost prevalent am ong the most sim ilar (collinear) variables is form ed. The th ree cluster criteria will be S =90-92.5% and n 4  X  15, S =92.5-97.5% and n 4  X  10, and S =97.5-100% and n A new variable is then created to repres ent the union of the original two binding sites, i.e. if one OR the other TFBS appear on a gene (=1), then the new variable equals 1 for that gene, otherwise the new variable equals 0. It is important to note this cluster analy sis method may find its own use for analy zing this ty pe of data, since none of the inform ation from sim ilar binding site s will be discarded. The new variable incorporates the origin al inform ation from the collinear binding sites, so once the analy sis is com plete and the new variable is found to be significan t, the individual binding sites can be explored further. Multivariate logistic regression anal ysis is the statistical approach we us ed to clas sify objects (TF BS) into two outcomes or binary response (1=positive gene, 0=negative gene). The objects (regression coefficients) in our study are the individual binding sites or the new variables form ed by the clus ter analy sis. M any variable selection methods can be used to formulate a final model, such as backward and forward elim ination, recursive partitioning, and stepwise regression [15] . In this study , backward elimination and forward selection procedures are chosen to begin the logistic regression analy sis. All explanatory variables in the initial m odel are specified as main effects, since testing pairwise interactions is im practical in the pres ence of m any predictors . The forward selection procedure adds the variable having the highest correlation with the dependent variable to the m odel. At each s election s tep, each variable is tentatively added to the model and the  X  2 -statistic is calculated. After all predictors have been evaluated, the one with the highest  X  2 -statistic is added to level considered to be  X  X ignificant X . Once there are no longer significant predictors , the proces s term inates . The backward elimination procedur e is used to remove variables independent variables are corre lated (redundancy ). If removing the variable with the lowest  X  2 -statistic does not result in a significantly poorer model fit, the variable is permanently elim inated. This continues until all the variables left in the m odel are cons idered s ignificant. In order to estim ate the power (s ensitivity ) and Ty pe I error (false positive rate), Receiver Operati ng Characteristic (ROC) curves are us ed to evaluate the full m odel and the reduced model using backward elimination. A goodness-of-fit test is appropriate to determ ine the fit of the reduced model. See the following section for details and an exam ple.
 Since the number of predictors in the model is reduced using the procedures above, interaction terms can be added. The forward selection and backward elim ina tion procedures are employ ed again to find significant interacti on terms. If the two procedures do not find the same interaction te rms to be significant, significant effects from both are added to the model. Higher order interactions are added when two-way interactions involving common variables are observed. An ROC curve is a plot of th e true positive rate (sensitivity ) versus the false positive rate (1-sp ecificity ) of a m odel for vary ing cut-off points or criterion. The clos er the curve follows the vertical axis and the top of the graph, the better the m odel, s ince a high sensitivity coincides with a low false positive rate. The following exam ple ROC curves (F igure 1) show the difference between different tes ts with the leas t accurate predictive model being the 45-degree diagonal. There are two applications of the ROC curve in the s cope of this model including all main effects with a reduced model based on logistic regression analy sis. Id eally , the power (sensitivity ) will remain the same for both models at a chosen Ty pe I error rate (1-specificity ). The second is to select cut-off values for validation of the model, once the final m odel is determ ined using the training sample. This final model is fit and the predicted values of the response variable (  X  ) are calculated. The ROC curve s hows the range of sensitivity for an ideal range of false positive rates. Next, if we plot the error rates (false positive and false negative) against the predicted probability level, the cut-off probability for validation will be found where the upper and lower lim it of the ideal false positive range intersect the two curves. We chose to validate the final model using a leave-one-out cross-validation method. SAS  X  LOGIS TIC calculates the cros s -validated individual predicted probability of each response level. These probabilities are derived by leaving out one observation each tim e and recalculating the param eter es tim ates . Us ing the cutoff probability from the ROC curv es, we can estim ate the false positive and false negative error rates of our 'best' m odel. From the exam ple data s et, the fixed effects are time , cell type and action , whereas donor is the random effect. Using (1), the mixed model is fit and we test the random and fixed main effects. The selection of positive and negative genes is based on the significance of the cell action main effect. With this data, 156 genes are selected as positive and 1000 genes are classified as controls. SAS  X  MIXED is used to analy ze this data set. Once the positive and negative genes are selected with m ixed m odel analy sis, they are m apped to Celera Hum an Trans cripts (hCTs ). Out of the 156 positive genes, 140 m ap to 133 hCTs. Out of the 133 positive hCTs, 72 have putativ e TFBS within  X 1.5 kb and +0.5 kb relative to the TSS in a human-mouse conser ved segment. These 72 hCTs contain 209 distin ctive TFBS. Using the same procedure for the 1000 negative genes, 713 map to 691 unique hCTs. Out of the 691 negative hCTs, 381 have putative TFBS within a conserved promoter region. The final negative set contains 381 hCTs and 228 distin ctive TFBS. After combining the positive and negative sets, 453 hCTs contain 228 binding sites. Out of these 228 binding sites, 227 remain after the filtering, i.e. only one binding site appeared on one gene or less. Therefore, the final data s et prepared for clus ter and regres sion analy ses contains 453 hCTs with 227 TFBS. The clus ter analy sis was perform ed with three criteria com bining sim ilarity ( S ) percentage using (2), and the total number of appearances on the genes ( n 4 ). The num ber of tim es thes e collinear m otifs occurred at the sam e location on a gene was also counted. Table 2 shows the 47 co llinear TFBS we com bined to form 21 new TFBS. The percent of total genes, where they occurred at the same position, is found in the last column. Most of the collinear m otifs in Table 2 belong to the sam e motif family . This may be due to their very similar binding sequences/m atrix, which will gene rate two m otif binding sites for the sam e sequence. In fact, detailed analy sis of those collinear binding sites indicates most of them do locate at the same sequence position. Using GATA-1 and GATA-2 as an exam ple, Table 2 suggests they either both appear or both do not appear on 90-92.5% of all genes in the training sample, appear together on more than 15 hCTs , and when they appear together, they are found at the same location 83.8% of the time. Alternatively , the cluster analy sis has detected those collinear binding sites from different m otif fam ilies, such as MEIS and TGIF , CRE-BP1 and vJun , Arnt and Max , RSRFC4 and aMEF-2 . All of these motif pairs have been reported to cooperatively work together [16, 17, 18, 19] . You can see from Table 2 the percentage of tim e thes e pairs app ear in the sam e location is m uch lower (0.0-42.9%) than the supposed m otif fam ilies. This shows that our motif cluster method can be applied to identify cooperative binding motifs in a more general manner, as well as motifs belonging to the same family . Collinear binding sites m ay be found at m ore than one location on a given gene. The data after the cluster analy sis now contains 453 hCTs and 201 TFBS and the logistic regression an aly sis is applied. After the backward/forward selection proce dures described in Section 2.5 are applied, the 16 m ain effects rem aining in the final model are ATF6, AhR, c-Ets-1( p54) , c-Myc/Max, E2F, GATA_C, HSF_C, MEF2, Myogenin/NF-1, NFY , NFkcR_C, Spz1, STAT_C, STAT5_C, STAT5At, TATA . The four interactions in the final model are [ c-ETs-1( p54) *GATA_C ], [ MEF2*STAT_C ], [ NFY *NFkcR_C ], [ NfkcR_C*STAT5At ], and [ STAT5At*TATA ]. There is als o a s ignificant three-way interaction: [ STAT5At*NFkcR_C*NFY ]. The final param eter es tim ates and standard errors are shown in the following SAS  X  output: Parameter Estimate Error Intercept -2.4154 0.2631 ATF6 3.1516 0.7471 AhR -2.1887 0.9132 c-Ets-1 (p54) 1.6998 0.3863 c-M yc/M ax 1.1200 0.3990 E2F -1.3591 0.4489 GATA_C -0.1321 0.5202 HSF_C 1.0521 0.5473 MEF2 -3.6921 1.4472 My ogenin/NF-1 2.0345 0.6718 Parameter Estimate Error NFY -0.4989 0.6022 NFkcR_C 1.3382 0.4533 Spz 1 -1.9450 0.6831 ST AT _C 1.2222 0.4134 STAT5_C -4.5466 2.1155 ST AT 5At -5.5489 2.9048 TATA 0.9677 0.5738 c-ETs-1(p54)*GATA_C -5.0556 1.5750 MEF 2*S TAT_C 3.7690 1.8587 NFY*NFkcR_C -5.3897 2.0150 NFkcR_C*STAT5At 8.3482 2.8947 STAT5At*TATA 4.9338 2.2959 STAT5At*NFkcR_C*NFY 6.5811 2.7536 Logistic regression analy sis can not only select the significant main effects (m otifs) for the final m odel, but also detect the significant interactions among motif s. The final model indicates 5 pairs of positive interactions and a three-way interaction. TA TA is the basic binding site for the RNA poly merase II, so its interaction with other m otifs m ay indicate a general phenomena. STAT5 and NF-kappaB have been reported to be cooperatively involved in the induction of IL-6 in macrophage differentiation (Kawashima et al., 2001). Their significant interaction in our model implies cooperative roles in Th cell activation as well. The newly identified interaction between MEF2 and STAT_C , and the three-way interaction need to be further validated experim entally to elucidate their potential roles in the Th cell activation process. A goodness of fit test is conducted af ter the model of main effects is reduced from 201 predictors to 16: statistically significant the convergen ce criteria and fit is satisfied. The power als o reduces for the s ame error rate when the num ber of variables is reduced, which is expected. S ince the decreas e is not dramatic (Figure 2), we can expect a relatively good model fit. Figu re 2: ROC cu rves to comp are fu ll an d red uced mod els In order to validate the results of the final m odel, a cutoff probability is estim ated and used to calculate the final error rates. The final model chosen in the sec tion above is used to predict the response (gene ty pe). The predicte d values are then used to create the following ROC curve (F igure 3). The reference lines on the curv e show a false positive rate between 0.16 and 0.32 y ields sens itivity between 0.70 and 0.80. With that in mind, exam ining Figure 4, where the false positive rate and false negative rate are s hown together, the error rates of be the cutoff value for the cros s-validation analy sis. Once the predicted probabilities for the cross-validation are calculated in SAS  X  LOGISTIC, if the P (positive gene) exceeds 0.227, the response = 1 and likewis e for response = 0 (see Table 3). Tab le 3: Pred icted vs . ob served res ponse for cros s-valid ation The table shows an 18.9% (72/381) Ty pe I error (false positive) rate and 41.7% (30/72) Ty pe II (false negative) error rate. In order to implement efficien t modeling methods for prediction and explanation of gene expre ssion and TFBS data, given an established database of individua l putative TFBS within genes, it is important to make use of a va riety of s tatis tical tools . The mixed model analy sis, motif clus tering, and logistic regression analy ses described in this pape r provide simple and alternative tools to accom plish this purpose. These m ethods allowed us to im prove the quality of data for our analy sis purposes, as well as provide insight into the data itself. Logistic regression analy sis of regulatory motifs has been applied previously for predicting tissue/signal specific transcription [4,20,21,22,23,24] . Most of these studies focused on binding sites known to be important to the transcription, while regression analy sis enhanced the prediction by identify ing the most significant sites. In our study , we have included all potential TFBS (total 227) in a human-m ouse conserved segment for the initial dataset. In this datase t, redundancies exist for the sam e TFBS, caused by slightly differe nt TRANSFAC matrix scanning. Transcription regulation in euka ryotes often involve the trans-regulatory action on a group of binding sites and there are only a few programs that have been developed to identify these cooperative binding sites, such as BioProspector [25] and CoBind [26] . Usually a collinearity analy sis would discard redundant predictor variables to im prove the model building procedures. Our clus ter analy sis effectively com bines same or s imilar binding sites, so no information is discar ded. Through cluster and logistic regression analy ses, we have chos en TFBS, com binatorial pairs of TF BS , and the interactions that are cons idered s ignificant for activated T -cell gene transcription. Current experimental evidence suggests most T -cell activation-specific genes are regulated by the simultaneous binding of multiple transcription factors including m embers of NF-kB/Rel/NF-AT , AP1 , Ets1 and CREB/AT F fam ilies [27] . In the final m odel, the coefficients for AT F6 , c-Ets-1( p54) , and NFKcR_C are all positive, which is also consistent with the existing knowledge of T-cell activation. As for NF-AT and AP1 , the matrix used for scanning is very short and degenerated, consequently , they are not significantly represented in the regulated genes com pared to contro ls in the data. Moreover, we may have identified some novel activated T -cell TFBS modules based on the strong significant effect of these sites in predicting the outcom e. Nevertheless, all m otifs in the final m odel are known to be im mune related and reported to be critical for genes in the immune response. We belie ve our approach would be very useful for applications, where gene expression regulation is less understood and there is no prior information about significant binding sites.
