 1. Introduction
There are many kinds of noise in a typhoon cloud image. If they cannot be efficiently reduced, they may affect the overall image quality to the extent that it is impossible to extract some important information. For example, the noise may disturb the procedure of locating the center position, when we try to predict the moving path of the typhoon. In addition, the contrast of some typhoon cloud images may be poor, which may affect in accurately segmenting the helical cloud band from the typhoon cloud image.
Therefore, it is important to efficiently reduce the noise and enhance the contrast in a typhoon cloud image. Recently, much good work has been carried out in satellite cloud image enhancement. Albertz and Zelianeos (1990) developed an ap-proach by merging the data from several satellite images of the
This enhancement technique is called Data Cumulation. The paper starts with the theory of sampling image data over a scene, discusses the theoretical background of the approach and describes its implementation. Simulated Data Cumulation has been carried out using both artificial targets and satellite image data as well. Fernandez-Maloigne pointed out that threshold selection is an important problem for the purpose of image enhancement. Image enhancement consists of subdividing the intensity gray levels into bands, such that the resulting image presents more contrast and less gray levels ( Fernandez-Maloigne, 1990 ). One means of achieving threshold selection is through the use of gray tone spatial dependency matrices. A function of gray levels is computed from a co-occurence matrix of the image and then a threshold is chosen that corresponds to the etrema of this function. This article describes the algorithm of GTRLM and the results of the application of this technique to some satellite images. Bekkhoucha presented a method for the improvement of the visual quality of satellite and aerial images ( Bekkhoucha and of urban growth in developing countries. This method is based on local contrast estimation. Results of the application of the nos accomplished satellite image enhancement and smoothing towards automatic feature extraction through an effective serial application of anisotropic diffusion processing and alternating sequential filtering ( Konstantinos Karantzalos, 2004 ). A robust error norm for  X  X  X dge-stopping X  X  function. A well-known class of afterwards for a more extended enhancement and smoothing.
Recently, the wavelet transform has been widely applied to image enhancement. Some image enhancement algorithms only consider the enhancement and do not care about noise reduction. For example, Fu and Wan used the improved histogram equalization in 2007). Temizel proposed two algorithms to enhance an image resolution scales and cycle-spinning methodology in the wavelet domain ( Temizel and Vlachos, 2005, 2006 ). Shi and Derado, respectively, proposed two algorithms to enhance the contrast of an image by only modifying the detail coefficients in wavelet algorithm to enhance the contrast of an image by modifying both coarse and detail coefficients ( Xiao and Ohya, 2007 ). Heric introduced a novel image enhancement technique based on the multiscale singularity detection with an adaptive threshold whose value is calculated via the maximum entropy measure in the proposed a wavelet-based enhancement method based on Bayesian estimation for multicomponent images or image series ( Scheunders and De Backer, 2005 ). Some image enhancement algorithms only consider noise reduction and do not care about detail enhancement.
For example, Ercelebi proposed a method by applying lifting-based wavelet domain Wiener filter to enhance the contrast of an image (Ercelebi and Koc, 2006).Theproposedmethodtransformsanimage the result into the spatial domain.

Many enhancement algorithms consider both detail enhance-ment and noise reduction. For example, Zeng proposed a wavelet-based algorithm for image contrast enhancement ( Zeng et al., 2004 ). The approach treats the correlation between wavelet planes as an indication of the likelihood that noise is present. Then, it modifies the wavelet transform coefficients at different scales in different degrees by a pointwise non-linear transformation. The algorithm achieves an excellent balance between the enhance-ment of subtle image detail and the avoidance of noise amplifica-tion. Jung Claudio described a new method for noise suppression and edge enhancement in digital images based on the wavelet transform ( Jung Claudio and Scharcanski, 2004 ). This method is adaptive to different amounts of noise in the image, and tends to be more robust to larger noise contamination than comparable techniques. Nakashizuka proposed a non-linear image enhance-avoid the emphasis of the noises, weighted unsharp masking techniques have been proposed. In these methods, the high-frequency component is defined as a product between a weighting function of which modulus increases around image edges and the linear high-pass filter output. Sun, Zhou, and Yong proposed three image enhancement algorithms based on wavelet transform ( Sun and Beom, 2005 ; Zhou et al., 2002 ; Yong et al., 2006 ). These algorithms can efficiently enhance the contrast of an image while suppressing speckle. Sakellaropoulos presented a method for mammographic image de-noising and contrast enhancement based on an overcomplete dyadic wavelet transform ( Sakellar-thresholding and contrast enhancement by a local non-linear gain operator. Sattar proposed a non-linear multiscale reconstruction method for image enhancement using dual-tree complex wavelet transform ( Sattar and Gao, 2003 ). This image enhancement method reduces additive noise while preserving the sharpness of the image. Jung proposed a method for image de-noising with edge preservation and enhancement, based on image multi-resolution decomposition by a redundant wavelet transform ( Jung and Scharcanski, 2003 ). Within the proposed framework, edge-related coefficients may be enhanced and de-noised simulta-neously. Mencattini presented an algorithm for mammographic image enhancement and de-noising based on the wavelet transform and local iterative fuzzy noise variance estimation ( Mencattini et al., 2005 ). Luo presented a new method of X-ray image de-noising based on fast lifting wavelet thresholding for
Belousov Artem described a developed two-phase full-color image enhancement algorithm ( Belousov Artem et al., 2006 ). During the first phase the picture is de-noised-based wavelet thresholding.
During the second phase brightness and contrast are automatically tuned up using evolutionary algorithm. Wu proposed an image enhancement method by combing partial differential equation (PDE) with wavelet shrinkage ( Wu and Ruan, 2006 ). Compared with traditional smoothing models, the new hybrid model has no
Gibbs phenomena, smoothes image without staircasing and enhances edge to preserve feature and texture of image.
Over the last decade, there has been much interest in discrete undecimated wavelet methods in signals and images. Therefore, hundreds of papers have been published in journals throughout the scientific and engineering disciplines. Recently, UWT has been widely applied to image processing, such as image de-noising (Gyaourova et al., 2002 ; Florian and Thierry, 2007 ; Alin et al., 2004 ; Gnanadurai and Sadasivam, 2005 ; Fabrizio et al., 2005 ; De and Gionatan, 2003 ; Chambolle and Lucier, 2001 ; Sveinsson and Atli Benediktsson, 2003 ; Sveinsson et al., 1998 ; Mahmoud and and Bhat, 2006 ), image fusion ( Liu et al., 2006 ; Styliani and 1997 ), image enhancement ( Beaulieu et al., 2003 ; Wang et al., 2003 ; Lemeshewsky, 2002 ), image code ( Liang and Thomas, 1998 ; Wu and Su, 1999 ; Al-Mohimeed and Mohammed, 1998 ), feature extraction ( Pun and Lee, 2004 ) and segmentation ( Zhang can get rid of the Gibbs phenomena when the de-noising image is obtained by inverse UWT.

Now some image enhancement methods based on wavelet transform consider only detail enhancement and not the noise reduction or suppression ( Fu et al., 2000 ; Wan and Shi, 2007 ; 2006 ; Derado et al., 2007 ; Xiao and Ohya, 2007 ; Heric and
Potocnik, 2006 ; Scheunders and De Backer, 2005 ). Some image enhancement methods consider only reducing noise and not detail enhancement ( Ercelebi and Koc, 2006 ). Some image enhancement methods consider both noise reduction and detail enhancement.
However, most of them estimate the de-noising threshold using 2002 ; Yong et al., 2006 ; Sakellaropoulos et al., 2002 ; Jung and Scharcanski, 2003 ; Mencattini et al., 2005 ; Luo et al., 2006 ;
Belousov Artem et al., 2006 ; Wu and Ruan, 2006 ). In fact, it is difficult because the accurate statistic properties of the noise cannot be priorly known or accurately predicted. Moreover, most of them enhance detail by user interference so as to obtain good their wide applications in actual image enhancement. In order to solve the above problems, an efficient enhancing algorithm for a typhoon cloud image is proposed by employing UWT and genetic algorithm (GA). First, UWT is implemented to a typhoon cloud image. Noise is then reduced in the fine high-frequency sub-bands of each decomposition level so that the maximum signal-noise ratio can be obtained in the high-frequency sub-bands. The de-noising threshold is estimated by genetic algorithm (GA) in the
UWT domain. Detail is enhanced by an improved non-linear gain operator in the coarse high-frequency sub-bands of each decom-parameters, GA is used to search for the optimal non-linear gain parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed algo-rithm can efficiently reduce the additive gauss white noise (GWN) while enhancing the detail in the typhoon cloud image. Finally, we compare our algorithm with other some similar image enhancing algorithms. Fig. 1 shows the diagram of the proposed enhancing algorithm, where UWT presents undecimated wavelet transform,
IUWT indicates inverse undecimated wavelet transform. 2. Discrete undecimated wavelet transform
The undecimated discrete wavelet transform is redundant and shift invariant and it gives a dense approximation to the continuous wavelet transform than the approximation provided by the orthonormal discrete wavelet transform. From the filter bank point of view, we keep both even and odd downsamples, and further split the lowpass bands. We can also show the UWT from the matrix point of view. The undecimated discrete wavelet transform can be visualized as a matrix multiplication
Y  X  W y  X  1  X  where y is a 1 N input vector, W is an ( L +1) N N matrix, where L is the number of levels of decomposition, and Y is the ( L +1) N 1 output vector. W =[ W 1 , W 2 , y , W L , W L + 1 ] T , where W single vector W i , which is the usual discrete wavelet transform (DWT) basis at i th scale ( i =1 for the finest scale), and W scaling function at the coarsest scale. There are many inverse transforms, and a balanced one is given by
M  X  1 2 W 1 ; 1 increasing redundancy of the UWT as the scale becomes coarser.
Fortunately fast algorithm exists, so that the total number of operations is O ( LN ), which is at most O ( N log N ). 3. De-noising principle with UWT
Wavelet transform of the colored noise is non-stationary. De-proved that wavelet transform of the colored noise is still stationary at all scales of every resolution level ( Johnstone and resolution level are calculated to effectively reduce noise in an image.

We consider discrete image model as g  X  i ; j  X  f  X  i ; j  X  e  X  i ; j  X  3  X 
The above equation can be written in the matrix form as g  X  f  X  e  X  4  X  corrupted original image, e ={ e [ i , j ]} i , j , i =1, stationary signal. UWT is implemented to Eq. (4), we have F  X  U f  X  5  X  E  X  U e  X  6  X  G  X  U g  X  7  X  G  X  F  X  E  X  8  X  where U is a two-dimension UWT operator. The  X  X  X oft-threshold X  X  function, which was proposed by Donoho , is employed to reduce the noise in the image: G  X  T d 3 G  X  9  X  T  X  diag f t  X  m ; m g tm ; m  X   X  F  X  T d 3 F  X  10  X 
According to Eqs. (7) and (9), the inverse transformation for the input signal is written as follows: g  X  U 1 3 G d  X  11  X 
The above total operations can be expressed as g  X  Z d 3 g  X  12  X  Z  X  U 1 3 T d 3 U  X  13  X  statistic properties of the noise are employed to approximate the optimal threshold d , standard variance s can be used ( Johnstone and Silverman, 1997 ; Grace Chang et al., 2000 ). However, the
Assume that the original signal f [ i , j ] can be expressed by employing the linear combinations of its neighboring elements. can be replaced by the weighting average values of their neighboring elements, and the noise in the image can be smoothed out in this way, and a cleaner signal can be obtained.
Revised signal ~ g is employed to calculate the de-nos replaced by ~ g  X  i ; j : ~ g  X  Z  X  g  X  1 ; 1 ; ... ; ~ g  X  i ; j ; ... ; g  X  R ; C  X  T measure to determine the optimal threshold. If the threshold d is threshold d is too big, much useful signal will be reduced. The same processing is repeated to all the components and proper thresholds can be obtained by employing the following equation: OCV  X  d  X  X  1 RC
The forms of ~ g  X  i ; j can be of many forms. Here we let ~ g  X  i ; j  X  ~ g  X  i ; j , and have gi ; j  X  ~ g d i ; j  X   X  g  X  i ; j g d  X  i ; j 1 ~ z  X  i ; j where, ~ zi ; j  X   X  formula in the UWT domain will be given as
U GCV  X  d  X  X   X  1 = RC  X  U where tr is the trace of a matrix, : U : indicates Euclidean norm based on inner product, I is unit matrix R C , meaning of other signs is the same as the front. Let d n =arg min MSE ( d ), ~ by  X  X  X eneralized cross validation X  X , is an asymptotic optimal solution ( Jansen, 1997 ). 4. De-noising threshold estimation in UWT domain
According to Section 3, we have to minimize U GCV  X  d  X  in order to obtain the asymptotic optimal de-noising threshold. Jansen used the  X  X  X old segmentation X  X  method to obtain the de-noising function. In fact, U GCV  X  d  X  curve is just like the shape in
Fig. 2 . Thus we cannot obtain good de-noising threshold only by
GA can find the near-global optimal solutions in a large solution space quickly. We will employ the GA ( Shyu and Leou, 1998 )to by the following equation:  X  min 9 W d s  X  i ; j  X  9 the image. Before running GA, several issues must be considered as follows. 20 and the initial population will contain 20 chromosomes (binary bit strings), which are randomly selected. The maximum number and enhancing the typhoon cloud image in our manuscript, respectively.

For the multi-point crossover, the crossover-point positions of the bit string segments of pair-wise bit strings are randomly selected. Mutation is carried out by performing the bit inversion operation on some randomly selected positions of the parent bit
The GA will be iteratively performed on an input degraded is the number of iterations being larger than another threshold.
Then the chromosome (the solution) with the smallest fitness function value is determined. The optimal threshold is used to reduce the noise in the image. Applying GA, one parameter will form a chromosome (solution) represented as a binary bit string, in which the parameter is described by 20 bits. We will employ the
GA to optimize continuous variables ( Shyu and Leou, 1998 ). 5. Detail enahancement in UWT domain
Next, based on discrete UWT, a kind of non-linear enhancement operation, which was proposed by Laine in 1994, is employed to enhance the local contrast for image ( Laine et al., 1994 ). We suppress pixel values of very small amplitude, and enhance only level of transform space. We design the following function to accomplish this non-linear operation: h  X  y  X  X  a s igm  X  c  X  y b  X  X  s igm  X  c  X  y  X  b  X  X   X  20  X  where y  X  i ; j  X  h  X  i ; j = max h  X  21  X  a  X  1 sigm  X  c  X  1 b  X  sigm  X  c  X  1  X  b  X  ;  X  22  X  0 o b o 1 ; s igm  X  y  X  X  1 1  X  e y ;  X  23  X  there always exists a threshold F such that pixels with absolute values larger than F are enhanced, while pixels with absolute values smaller than F are suppressed. The exact value of F can be obtained by solving the non-linear Eq. h ( y ) y =0. However, for simplicity the threshold is controlled through the parameter b .
Similarly, we use the standard deviation of pixel values to adaptively select T by the following equation:
F  X  1 2 where m y is the mean value of y and N 1 N 2 is size of the image.
Thus for each band-pass image the threshold value is directly related to the energy of the image within that band (wavelet sub-space). 1300 1400 1500 1600 1700 1800 1900 2000 2100 2200 2300 U

We can expand the above non-linear operation from spatial domain to UWT domain. For convenience, let us define the following transform function to enhance the high-frequency sub-band images in each decomposition level: sub-band image to be enhanced, NEO is non-linear enhancement operation, X , Y is width and height of image, respectively. the maximum of gray value of all pixels in r d s  X  i ; j . r of a , b , c can be set. The contrast enhancement approach can be described by

Before running GA, several issues must be considered as follows. set to 20 and the initial population will contain 20 chromosomes (binary bit strings), which are randomly selected. The maximum number of iterations (generations) of GA is set as 50 in our experiment. (B) Fitness function : In this paper, the fitness (objective) function is used to evaluate the goodness of a chromosome (solution). Shannon X  X  entropy function is used to quantify the gray-level histogram complexity ( Fu et al., 2000 ). Given a probability distribution P =( P 1 , P 2 , y , P n ) with p and P n
S  X  b ; c  X  X  distribution, the histogram should be normalized before applying for image enhancement. The better the enhanced image contrast, the bigger the Eq. (27). The range of values of b and c is set as 0 o b o 1 and 0 o c o 50, respectively. (C) Genetic operations : For GA, the three genetic operations, namely reproduction, crossover and mutation, will be obtained by
Section 4. Detail information can be seen in Section 4. 6. Enhanced image quality assessment
Digital images are subject to a wide variety of distortions during acquisition, processing, compression, storage, transmission and reproduction, any of which may result in a degradation of visual quality. For applications in which images are ultimately to be viewed by human beings, the only  X  X  X orrect X  X  method of qualifying visual image quality is through subjective evaluation.
In practice, however, subjective evaluation is usually too incon-venient, time-consuming and expensive ( Wang et al., 2004 ). The goal of research in objective image quality assessment is to develop quantitative measures that can automatically predict perceived image quality.

An objective image quality metric can play a variety of roles in algorithms and parameter settings of image processing systems. Third, it can be used to benchmark image processing systems and algorithms. We construct a quality measure from the perspective of image information in order to assess the enhanced image quality.
The system separates the task of enhanced image quality measurement into three comparisons: information entropy, con-trast and signal-noise ratio.

First, the information entropy of each enhanced image is compared. We use Eq. (27) to assessment the detail information of enhanced images. The better the enhanced image quality, the bigger the information entropy.
 Second, the contrast of each enhanced image is compared. Assuming a discrete signal, the mean intensity can be written as  X  we remove the mean intensity from the signal. In discrete form, onto the hyperplane defined by
We used the standard deviation (the square root of variance) as form is given by S  X 
The better the enhanced image quality, the bigger the S c
Third, the peak-signal-noise ratio (PSNR) of enhanced image is compared.
 S  X  10 log and enhanced image, respectively. W and H are width and height of the original image, respectively. The better the enhanced image quality, the bigger the S p .

Finally, the three components are combined to yield an overall measure S  X  f  X  S e ; S c ; S p  X  X  32  X  Generally, the better the enhanced image quality, the bigger the S . However, the PSNR may become small after an image is enhanced and reduced noise although the overall quality of an image is good. Therefore we construct the following overall measure to assess the quality of an enhanced image: S  X  X  S e  X  l  X  S c  X  x sign  X  S p  X j S p j t where l 4 0, x 4 0and t 4 0 are parameters used to adjust therelativeimportanceofthethreecomponents.Inordertosimplify the expression and the above analysis to PSNR, we set l = x =1 and t =1/5 in this paper. This results in a specific form of the following index: S  X  S e S c sign  X  S p  X j S p j 1 5
The better the enhanced image quality, the bigger the S . 7. Experimental results
In experiments, three infrared typhoon cloud images :TAILIM (NO. 0513), SONAMU (NO. 0611) and CIMARON (NO. 0620), which are provided by China Meteorological Administration, China
National Satellite Meteorological Center, are used to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the three typhoon cloud images are corrupted by additive gauss white noise (GWN). In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we will compare the performance between the proposed algorithm (ZCJ), enhancing method only using discrete undecimated wavelet transform (UWT method: only enhance the details by Eq. (26) in
UWT domain), AFL method ( Laine et al., 1994 ), WYQ method ( Wu et al., 2004 ), XLZ method ( Zong and Laine, 1996 ) and EE method -1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 -1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 -1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 (Ercelebi and Koc, 2006 ). Here we only give the experimental results for two typhoon cloud images (typhoon TAILIM NO. 0513 and typhoon CIMARON NO. 0620).
 image (typhoon TAILIM NO. 0513) and the corresponding noisy one respectively, show de-noising and enhancement results by UWT, AFL, WYQ, XLZ, EE and ZCJ. According to Fig. 3 ,wecanseethatboth
UWT method and AFL method only consider enhancing contrast of an image while noise is also enhanced while enhancing the contrast of the typhoon cloud image. The AFL method, which is proposed than the UWT method; however, there are some undesired spots in the enhanced typhoon cloud image. Both WYQ method and XLZ method consider noise suppression while enhancing the contrast of the typhoon cloud image. The WYQ method has enlarged the background bur while enhancing contrast of the typhoon cloud image. The XLZ method has a good de-noising result; however, the details in the typhoon cloud image are blurred. The EE method has cloud image is not satisfactory.

By comparing the above-mentioned five methods, it can be seen that the ZCJ method has not only good de-noising result but also good detail enhancement, which is obvious in Fig. 3 (h). In order to explain the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, another typhoon cloud image (typhoon CIMARON) is used to show the represents original typhoon cloud image, noisy image (gauss white noise), UWT method, AFL method, WYQ method, XLZ method, EE method and ZCJ method, where Fig. 4 (b) indicates noisy image the same conclusion as from Fig. 3 .

 In order to objectively assess the enhanced images quality, enhanced images using six different algorithms. According to Table overall quality using the proposed algorithm is the best compared with five other methods.

In order to explain further the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, Table 3 list the scores of enhanced images with different noise standard deviations. According to Table 3 , we can see that the scores of enhanced images are becoming lower and lower with the increase in standard deviation of noise. Compared with five other methods, the scores of enhanced images using the proposed algorithm are the highest. This exactly proves the advantage of the proposed algorithm.

In order to be able to clearly see the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, Fig. 8 shows the score curves of enhanced images with six algorithms using Table 3 . We can draw the same conclusion as from Table 3 . 8. Conclusion
In this paper, we propose an algorithm to suppress the noise and extrude detail for a typhoon cloud image by the GCV, non-linear gain operation with GA in UWT domain. GA is used to obtain the asymptotic optimal de-noising threshold in the UWT domain without the accurate statistic properties of noise priorly known. The optimal nonlinear gain parameters can adaptively be also obtained by GA in the UWT domain. An efficient objective assessment measure, which combines information entropy, con-enhanced typhoon cloud images. Our proposed algorithm can efficiently suppress the additive GWN for a typhoon cloud image while extruding the details of images well. Compared with the enhancing algorithms which are based on classical wavelet transform, our conclusions can be as follows: 1) Both UWT and classical wavelet transform take account very well of image noise. 2) As evidenced by experiments with the UWT, better de-nosing and enhancing results than UWT, AFL, WYQ, XLZ and EE can be obtained.

UWT de-noising over classical wavelet transform. 4) The proposed algorithm can well suppress the additive GWN in an image while extruding details well; however, most of the methods based on classical wavelet transforms can result in some detail lost or some undesired artifacts. 5) The proposed algorithm can adaptively obtain the optimal non-linear enhancement parameters by GA; however, most of the existing image enhancement methods have to determine the enhancement parameters by a user or an expert. 6) Most of the existing image enhancement methods based on classical wavelet transform assess the enhanced image quality by subjective method; however, the proposed algorithm can assess the enhanced image quality by an objective assessment measure.

Further works include reducing computation burden of the proposed algorithm and improving the proposed algorithm by combing UWT with Curvelet transform, Contourlet transform or
Surfacelet transform. In addition, we will plan to use the low-frequency components in the UWT domain to enhance global contrast of the typhoon cloud image.
