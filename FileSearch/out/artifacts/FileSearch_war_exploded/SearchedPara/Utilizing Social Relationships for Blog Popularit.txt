 In recent years, blogging has become a trend for people to publish content on the discuss the latest news, and express their opinions. As an emerging online medium, many blog hosting sites now provide free services. Given this convenient platform, the number of blogs is increasing in a dramatically fast manner. 
A blog consists of the title, subscription information, multiple posts which are dis-played in a descending order by the publish date. A general blog post is combined with the post date, text, hyperlinks, images and other media. The user writing a blog is a blogger. There may be some comments or trackbacks from other bloggers below a bloggers can add favorite blogs to their blogrolls which indicate the subscriptions or links listed in the front page of a blog. These are the most common interactions between bloggers. Also, hyperlinks contained within a blog post give additional in-formation for readers who would like to read some more related news, or blog posts. 
Bloggers may form virtual communities through several kinds of interactive behav-iors among bloggers and their audience. In comparison with general web contents, blogs show the particular characteristics themselves. Many researchers consider blogs to be valuable resources. As a result of the massive growth of blogs, blog readers may ones contain the most informative contents . Some Blog service providers (BSPs) list hot blogs based on the number of visitors, but this indicator is weak for determining the quality of blogs. Many web sites have developed some blog-related technologies. 
Google Blog Search 1 and Technorati 2 are now available for users to search blogs by query words. BlogLook 3 provides a ranking service for blogs. It allows bloggers to enter the URL of his blog, and multiple features along with the corresponding rank-ings are computed. The features are obtained from the search engines. However, the detailed information such as content, comments, links, and citations within the blogs are not considered comprehensively in these services. Though the number of blog interactions is used to calculate the authority score for Technorati, the comments are ignored and the various interactions are all seemed as the same. 
The PageRank [16] is a popular ranking algorithm for web pages. For a hyper-linked set of pages, PageRank assigns a score to each page representing its relative importance among pages. The linking structure in the blogosphere is similar to that in web sites but with additional characteristics. Thus, general ranking method for web pages is not appropriate for the structure of the blogosphere. Some ranking algorithms for blogs are presented in recent studies. EigenRumor [7] is based on eigenvector calculation of the adjacency matrix of links, which is similar to HITS [10] and Pag-eRank. The algorithm focus on the behaviors of bloggers on blog posts. We find some interactions between bloggers should be taken into account. BlogRank [4] is a gener-alized form of PageRank which use similarity features to make the link graph denser. The study does not consider the comments. Comments are conversational information for blog post. We regard this kind of interactions as an important factor for analysis. This work presents a comprehensive study on the interactive behaviors in the blog community. The behaviors could be seemed as connections between bloggers. We think that the interconnections reveal the consciousness of bloggers, and the impact of blogs can be derived by analyzing this information. 
A blog with the high popularity produce more interactive behaviors to other blog-gers. For a popular blog, the contents are normally informative for some readers. The posts could be insightful discussions or innovative opinions depending on subjective judgments. However, analyzing the contents is a time-consuming work. We therefore aim to use other obvious factors which reveal the consciousness of readers. In a popu-lar blog, there may be more support relationships made by other different bloggers than in general ones. In addition, bloggers play different roles in the blogosphere. These criteria should be taken into account to measure the blog popularity. Users may cite a blog or a blog post in a web page including personal web sites, forums, or any other web contents. When a blog is frequently referenced on the internet, we can say that the blog receives a high reputation. A ccording to these observations, it is claimed that the popularity of blogs could be measured by their impact on induced social interconnections. PageRank is used to analyze the page reputation or popularity in the linking graph. With the linking structure between web pages, the ranking score is generated in a random walking model for PageRank. The probabilities for a random surfer moving from a web page A to another web page B is a critical concept in the algorithm. We use blog interactive behaviors to construct a blog network model which describes the blogosphere, a weighted and interaction-aware PageRank algorithm called  X  X Rank X  is proposed in this paper. In addition to the explicit relationships for blog interactions, common links in the posts which are regarded as the similarity relationship between blogs is also employed in the blog network model. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We introduced some related work in Section 2. The detail of the method is described in Section3. In Section 4, we presented some experimental results and discussions and this work is concluded in Section 5. PageRank is a link analysis algorithm that calculates the importance score for each element of a group of hyperlinked documents. We think the linking structure in the blogosphere is different with that in web sites. Thus, our BRank would be designed based on the characteristics of blogs. Kleinberg [10] proposed the Hyperlink-In duced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm. This is another prominent algorithm for ranking web pages. The critical concepts are the hubs and authorities. The hub score presents the quality of links to other pages Besides web pages, Yupeng et al. [19] presented an expertise propagation algorithm to find the potential experts for a specific topic by using the co-occurrences of people from web pages and communication patterns from emails. 
In the related work on analyzing blogs, Nard i et al. [6] analyzed the text of blog posts and comments in order to identify feelings of a community. Alvin and Mark [3] employed the centrality measures and visualizations to detect the communities in blogs. Xiaochuan et al. [18] categorized th e post contents into informative articles and affective articles. Their study aimed to improve the classification of emotions from blog posts. Tirapat et al. [17] studied the relationship between the success of a movie and the  X  X uzz X  in blogosphere. They constituted a topic map by analyzing the blog posts capturing associations between movies and blog entries. Temporal discussions and stories in blog communities were exploited by Arun et al. [5]. They proposed a Content-Community-Time model which uses the content and timestamps of entries. Lento et al. [12] applied the logic regression model and network visualizations to analyze the blog data in the Wallop system. They investigated the relationship be-tween blog interactions and the willingness of bloggers to continue updating blogs. Furukawa [8] defined the regular reading relation which describes the reading behav-ior for bloggers. Four kinds of social netw ork are examined respectively to predict the regular reading relation and analyze the information diffusion. Ali-Hason and Adamic [2] studied the bloggers X  online and real life relationships in three blog communities. They analyzed the different kinds of links including blogrolls, citations, and com-ments and discovered that few blog interactions reflect the real life relationships. 
Gill et al. [9] discussed the effect of blogs on mass media and politics. It also com-pares some websites such which provide blog ranking services. Nakajima et al. [14] aimed to capture critical conversation topics from blogs. They proposed a blog thread model and define the roles of bloggers as agitators and summarizers. The agitators are considered to have a great impact on the discussions in the blogosphere. The time-stamps of posts are examined to discriminate these two kinds of bloggers. 
Some algorithms were proposed in the following studies. Adar et al. [1] introduced the implicit links representing similarity between blog posts. With the implicit links, a blog ranking algorithm called iRank was presented. Apostolos et al. [4] add implicit and users. They modified the PageRank into an algorithm for ranking blogs called BlogRank. Comments are not considered in their work. As the most frequent interac-tions, comments show their importance in our work. The B2Rank [13] presented by Mohammad is also modified from PageRank. Nitin et al. [15] investigated the behav-iors of influential bloggers and presented a preliminary model to quantify them. Sev-eral experiments were conducted to identify influential bloggers from many distinct points. The work focuses on the community blogs, and our study targets the individ-ual blogs. Fujimura et al [7] proposed the EigenRumor algorithm for ranking blogs. The algorithm is based on HITS and can be applied on communities with observable membership identities. They define the information providers as agents. The agent property consists of the authority score and the hub score. 
Some Web sites also provide the blog ranking service. Technorati is real-time blog search engine which watches over 100 million blogs. It allows users to know what is being discussed now in the blogosphere. Its authority ranking uses the blog authority which counts the number of blogs linking to a specific blog. BlogLook is a prominent blog ranking service in Taiwan. Its data contains more than 60,000 blogs. Instead of analyzing the real blog contents, blog information is retrieved from sev-eral blog search engines including Technorati authority, and the number of links and subscriptions. These services provide a general view of the blog reputation. Our method gives insight into various interactions inside a blog community. In addition, the number of links obtained from search engines will be adopted in this work for global blog ranking. Our method is based on the characteristics of blogs, which includes the linking struc-ture and blog similarity features. We first introduce the idea on measuring the blog popularity and present how the proposed blog network model is constructed. The proposed ranking algorithm will be detailed in the latter subsection. 3.1 Blog Social Relationships and Network The linking structure of a blogosphere is different from that of general web pages. When a blogger performs blog interactions like comments, trackbacks, the implicit link information is generated in the blog pages. The blog-specific linking structure is then constructed in this way. For exampl e, when a blogger A leaves comments to a blog post in blog B, a link to blog A is presented in the pages of blog B. For PageR-ank, blog A receive a vote from blog B. However, the original linking structure is not reasonable to represent the relationship. In deed, the sender of the comment, blog A, makes a vote to B in this case. This describes how the linking structure of blo-gosphere differs from that of general web pages. Blog readers can determine topics of are likely to read blogs containing similar contents. We hence assume that if Blog A and Blog B are similar, there will be some probability for readers of A to read B. co-occurrence of hyperlinks between blogs is regarded as a similarity relationship in our model. 
Two genres of blog social relationships between blogs are then defined in the pro-posed blog network model. Interactions or links from Blog A to Blog B indicate that A is a reader of B, and we take these relationships as support relationships . Four kinds of interactive behaviors, i.e., comments, trackback, blogrolls and citations, are all regarded as support relationships in our model. Common links in Blog A and Blog B make a similarity relationship between A and B. If Blog A and Blog B are similar, there will be some probability for readers of A to read B. 
Other than the blog relationships, several characteristics, e.g., the number of posts, comments and trackbacks and the average length of posts, for blogs should be taken into account. For each blog in the data set, the features are combined as a blog quality score . By using the score in the BRank algorithm, the impact score granted by a blog will be revised. 3.2 BRank The proposed social-based link analysis algorithm, BRank, computes the popularity scores in the blog network. BRank is a modified PageRank algorithm. Based on the original PageRank, we adjust the probability of a blog reader to follow a link in blog A to another blog B. The probability is given by a new formula as shown in Table 1. cided by the out degree of blog A. For BRank, it is determined by the relationship scores (R A  X  B ). In formula 2, set S represents the set of blogs linking to blog A. 
The relationship score for the bloggers from Blog A to Blog B is decided by three factors. The first is the type of blog relationships. Different blog relationships are given different weights ( W Rtype ) since they have distinct meanings for a blogger. This value will be set experimentally. The second factor is the number of the correspond-ing relationship. Here we simply aim to use the degree of the number ( RN Rtype ) to express the strength of the relationship. Instead of the actual numbers, we adopt the natural log values. The last one is the blog quality score ( BQ k ) which is combination of the normalized blog features. The blog quality score show the general activity of a blog. We assumed that the probability of moving to a blog with a higher quality score calculation. The relationship score combines all kinds of relationship between two blogs, and it can be calculate as follows: The list of relationship types between blog-gers A and K: We compute a relationship score for each edge in the blog network. A blog edge is a composition of the blog relationships. To recall, the blog relationships includes com-ments, trackbacks, blogrolls, and common links. Among them, common links create a virtual relationship, and the comment cause a support relationship which is oppo-has a corresponding weight, and the adjustment of weights will be discussed in the experiments. According to the above modifications, the formula of BRank can be defined as: where d is the damping factor defined as the original PageRank. In our experiments, we focus on 5 well-known BSPs in Taiwan: Wretch Blogs 4 , Yahoo Blogs 5 , Yam Blogs 6 , Xuite Blogs 7 and Pixnet Blogs 8 . The crawling process was started from the top blogs since September, 2007 to May, 2008. These crawled blogs are chosen from the top-bloggers list in several authoritative blog sharing and ranking sites. Thus, we can guarantee that our dataset contains the popular blogs and blogs which interact with them. After the blog pages have been retrieved, we then extract blog posts, comments, trackbacks, citations, and blogrolls in pages. The ex-traction program is customized for each type of blog pages since they are laid out in a variety of HTML templates. The statistics of our date set is presented in Table 2. 
In the conducted experiments, we retrieve the information from BlogLook for the purpose of experimental evaluation. The ranking data will be represented as Rank BL in the following sections. Besides the existed ranking service, we prepare three sets of manually ranking data. The first set consists of 400 blogs selected randomly from BlogLook for four BSPs including Wretch, Yahoo, Yam, and Pixnet. Several manual features are derived by four researchers and the summation scores will be our human ranking result for the 400 blogs. The manual features are: Detailed Discussion, Abun-dant Information, Clear and Suitable Self-defined Categories, Update Frequency, The quality of subscriptions, Suitable Advertisements and Expert Popularity Score. These features are established based on our criteria for determining the quality and popular-ity of blogs. All the manually rankings are named as Rank H for convenience. 
To quantify the comparisons between two kinds of rankings, we use the correlation coefficient and kappa coefficient in our experiments. The correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship. On the contrary,  X 1 refers to a perfect negative linear relationship. A value 0 repres ents that there is no correlation. We denote this coefficient as CC in the following sections. 
Cohen's kappa coefficient is a statistical measure for comparing the degree of con-sensus between raters. Cohen's kappa measures the agreement between two raters who each classify N items into C mutually exclusive categories. To use kappa coefficient for our ranking results (N=100), we simply divide the blogs into two disjoint categories (C=2). Thus, the kappa coefficient can be employed on the two categories between (1:2) and third-fold (2:1) in our experiments and denoted as K1, K2 and K3 respectively. 4.1 Effects of Blog Relationships with various settings of weights in the algorithm are done. In Fig. 2, we show the results for different weighting schemes. The comparison with the original PageRank is shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. For the average kappa value, our algorithm outperforms the PageRank in Wretch blogs. Although the kappa values are similar for Yam and Pixnet, the correlation coefficients show the difference. Kappa value including K1, K2, and K3 show a general view for detecting a group of better blogs. 4.1 The Analysis of Ranking Results In the following experiments, we will compare results of BRank (Rank L ) and ranks in BlogLook (Rank BL ) for each BSP. Rank H is considered as the ground truth in our evaluation. Table 3 represents the agreement analysis for Wretch, Yahoo, Yam and Xuite. According to the AvgK values, the proposed BRank outperforms BlogLook in these four BSPs. 
BRank attains the lower agreements and weak er correlation in Wretch. It is caused by the large amount of comment relationships. In Wretch, some diaries may be com-mented by a great number of friends and the comments are short and non-informative in general. This kind of noise comments will increase the ranking score for blogs in a small but highly connective community. Thus, our results may be biased. The proposed blog popularity ranking algorithm BRank detects the popularity of blogs in a BSP community by the social relationships. Using the proposed blog net-work model, we comprehensively examine the interactive behaviors in some BSPs. As the content analysis is a time-consuming work, the co-occurrence of hyperlinks is used to determine the similarity relationships between blogs. BRank is applied on a BSP community by investigating the interconnection. The ranking process can be accomplished efficiently and provide effective results. In the experiments, we dis-cover that the importance of interactions varies in different communities. Information of blogs is spread in different ways based on the characteristics of a blog community. The comparison results show a fair agreement with the judgment of human and our method could detect blogs which are popular in a BSP community.
