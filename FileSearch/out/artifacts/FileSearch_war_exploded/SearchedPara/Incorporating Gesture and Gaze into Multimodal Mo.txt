 In human communication, ideas tend to unfold in a structured way. For example, for an individual speaker, he/she organizes his/her utterances into sen-tences . When a speaker makes errors in the dy-namic speech production process, he/she may cor-rect these errors using a speech repair scheme. A group of speakers in a meeting organize their ut-terances by following a floor control scheme. All these structures are helpful for building better mod-els of human communication but are not explicit in the spontaneous speech or the corresponding tran-scription word string. In order to utilize these struc-tures, it is necessary to first detect them, and to do so as efficiently as possible. Utilization of various kinds of knowledge is important; For example, lex-ical and prosodic knowledge (Liu, 2004; Liu et al., 2005) have been used to detect structural events.
Human communication tends to utilize not only speech but also visual cues such as gesture, gaze, and so on. Some studies (McNeill, 1992; Cassell and Stone, 1999) suggest that gesture and speech stem from a single underlying mental process, and they are related both temporally and semantically. Gestures play an important role in human commu-nication but use quite different expressive mecha-nisms than spoken language. Gaze has been found to be widely used in coordinating multi-party con-versations (Argyle and Cook, 1976; Novick, 2005). Given the close relationship between non-verbal cues and speech and the special expressive capac-ity of non-verbal cues, we believe that these cues are likely to provide additional important informa-tion that can be exploited when modeling structural events. Hence, in my Ph.D thesis, I have been in-vestigating the combination of lexical, prosodic, and non-verbal cues for detection of the following struc-tural events: sentence units , speech repairs , and meeting floor control .

This paper is organized as follows: Section 1 has described the research goals of my thesis. Section 2 summarizes the efforts made related to these goals. Section 3 lays out the research work needed to com-plete my thesis. Our previous research efforts related to multimodal analysis of human communication can be roughly grouped to three fields: (1) multimodal corpus col-lection, annotation, and data processing, (2) mea-surement studies to enrich knowledge of non-verbal cues to structural events, and (3) model construc-tion using a data-driven approach. Utilizing non-verbal cues in human communication processing is quite new and there is no standard data or off-the-shelf evaluation method. Hence, the first part of my research has focused on corpus building. Through measurement investigations, we then obtain a bet-ter understanding of the non-verbal cues associated with structural events in order to model those struc-tural events more effectively. 2.1 Multimodal Corpus Collection Under NSF KDI award (Quek and et al., ), we col-lected a multimodal dialogue corpus. The corpus contains calibrated stereo video recordings, time-aligned word transcriptions, prosodic analyses, and hand positions tracked by a video tracking algo-rithm (Quek et al., 2002). To improve the speed of producing a corpus while maintaining its qual-ity, we have investigated factors impacting the ac-curacy of the forced alignment of transcriptions to audio files (Chen et al., 2004a).

Meetings, in which several participants commu-nicate with each other, play an important role in our daily life but increase the challenges to current infor-mation processing techniques. Understanding hu-man multimodal communicative behavior, and how witting and unwitting visual displays (e.g., gesture, head orientation, gaze) relate to spoken content is critical to the analysis of meetings. These multi-modal behaviors may reveal static and dynamic so-cial structure of the meeting participants, the flow of topics being discussed, the control of floor of the meeting, and so on. For this purpose, we have been collecting a multimodal meeting corpus un-der the sponsorship of ARDA VACE II (Chen et al., 2005). In a room equipped with synchronized mul-tichannel audio,video and motion-tracking record-ing devices, participants (from 5 to 8 civilian, mil-itary, or mixed) engage in planning exercises, such as managing rocket launch emergency, exploring a foreign weapon component, and collaborating to se-lect awardees for fellowships. we have collected and continued to do multichannel time synchronized au-dio and video recordings. Using a series of audio and video processing techniques, we obtain the word transcriptions and prosodic features, as well as head, torso and hand 3 D tracking traces from visual track-ers and Vicon motion capture device. Figure 1 de-picts our meeting corpus collection process. 2.2 Gesture Patterns during Speech Repairs In the dynamic speech production process, speak-ers may make errors or totally change the content of what is being expressed. In either of these cases, speakers need refocus or revise what they are saying and therefore speech repairs appear in overt speech. A typical speech repair contains a reparandum , an optional editing phrase , and a correction . Based on the relationship between the reparandum and the correction, speech repairs can be classified into three types: repetitions , content replacements , and false starts . Since utterance content has been modified in last two repair types, we call them content mod-ification ( CM ) repairs. We carried out a measure-ment study (Chen et al., 2002) to identify patterns of gestures that co-occur with speech repairs that can be exploited by a multimodal processing system to more effectively process spontaneous speech. We observed that modification gestures ( MGs ), which exhibit a change in gesture state during speech re-pair, have a high correlation with content modifica-tion ( CM ) speech repairs, but rarely occur with con-tent repetitions. This study does not only provide ev-idence that gesture and speech are tightly linked in production, but also provides evidence that gestures provide an important additional cue for identifying speech repairs and their types. 2.3 Incorporating Gesture in SU Detection A sentence unit (SU) is defined as the complete ex-pression of a speaker X  X  thought or idea. It can be ei-ther a complete sentence or a semantically complete smaller unit. We have conducted an experiment that integrates lexical, prosodic and gestural cues in or-der to more effectively detect sentence unit bound-aries in conversational dialog (Chen et al., 2004b).
As can be seen in Figure 2, our multimodal model combines lexical, prosodic, and gestural knowl-edge sources, with each knowledge source imple-mented as a separate model. A hidden event lan-guage model (LM) was trained to serve as lexical model ( P ( W, E ) ). Using a direct modeling ap-proach (Shriberg and Stolcke, 2004), prosodic fea-tures were extracted using the SRI prosodic fea-then were used to train a CART decision tree as the prosodic model ( P ( E | F ) ). Similarly to the prosodic model, we computed gesture features directly from visual tracking measurements (Quek et al., 1999; Bryll et al., 2001): 3 D hand position, Hold (a state when there is no hand motion beyond some adaptive threshold results), and Effort (analogous to the ki-netic energy of hand movement). Using gestural fea-tures, we trained a CART tree to serve as the gestu-ral model ( P ( E | G ) ). Finally, an HMM based model combination scheme was used to integrate predic-tions from individual models to obtain an overall SU prediction ( argmax ( E | W, F, G ) ). In our investiga-tions, we found that gesture features complement the prosodic and lexical knowledge sources; by using all of the knowledge sources, the model is able to achieve the lowest overall detection error rate.

A person controlling the floor bears the burden of moving the discourse along. By increasing our understanding of floor control in meetings, there is a potential to im-pact two active research areas: human-like conver-sational agent design and automatic meeting analy-sis. We have recently investigated floor control in multi-party meetings (Chen et al., 2006). In particu-lar, we analyzed patterns of speech (e.g., the use of discourse markers ) and visual cues (e.g., eye gaze exchange, pointing gesture for next speaker) that are often involved in floor control changes. From this analysis, we identified some multimodal cues that will be helpful for predicting floor control events. Discourse markers are found to occur frequently at the beginning of a floor. During floor transitions, the previous holder often gazes at the next floor holder and vice verse. The well-known mutual gaze break pattern in dyadic conversations is also found in some meetings. A special participant, an active meeting manager, is found to play a role in floor transitions. Gesture cues are also found to play a role, especially with respect to floor capturing gestures. In the next stage of my research, I will focus on inte-grating previous efforts into a complete multimodal model for structural event detection. In particular, I will improve current gesture feature extraction, and expand the non-verbal features to include both eye gaze and body posture. I will also investigate alter-native integration architectures to the HMM shown in Figure 2. In my thesis, I hope to better understand the role that the non-verbal cues play in assisting structural event detection. My research is expected to support adding multimodal perception capabili-ties to current human communication systems that rely mostly on speech. I am also interested in inves-tigating mutual impacts among the structural events. For example, we will study SUs and their relation-ship to floor control structure. Given progress in structural event detection in human communication, I also plan to utilize the detected structural events to further enhance meeting understanding. A par-ticularly interesting task is to locate salient portions of a meeting from multimodal cues (Chen, 2005) to summarize it.
