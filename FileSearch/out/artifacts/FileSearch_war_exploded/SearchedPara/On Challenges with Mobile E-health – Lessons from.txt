 Health portals play an important role in today X  X  health care, and the increased mobility places demands on the portals to provide as accurate and few suggestions as possible. Often the information seekers may be in distress, lacking medical knowledge and expressing themselves in ways that make it difficult for the portal to interpret the seekers X  needs. This raises the question on how portal providers may be able both to better model, or describe, the user behaviour and to predict the impact of changes in search algorithms to address these challenges.

This paper highlights some possibilities and benefits of a theoretic framework, based on existing works on game-theoretic treatments of information retrieval and communi-cation, to allow for both descriptive and predictive analysis of internet-based health communication. This is especially important in the context of increased mobility, demanding more accurate and fewer interactions. We also elaborate on how one of the fundamental results of game theory on equilibria may be used as a basis for improved information search. Possibly counter-intuitive, this is done not by tweak-ing the portal, but instead by trying to change the seekers X  behaviour towards passing more diversifying queries.

During the last decade, the first point of contact between a potential care seeker and health care has shifted from a physical meeting to an internet interaction [4]. The seeker is often in distress, trying to determine, by searching the internet, if it is necessary to seek care. Many have no, or very limited, medical knowledge, and need support from the health portal. The queries are often ambiguous and do not always reflect differences in the seekers X  information needs. For instance, if the seeker types the query  X  X troke X  she may be interested in treatments or how to prevent the disease, or she may want to read about other people X  X  experiences of the disease. Hence, the health portal is confronted by infor-mation seekers in different circumstances, often expressing themselves in unclear ways, and with different expectations.
Today, mobile devices such as smartphones have become more important when searching for health related informa-tion [1, 3]. By their smaller size, the interaction between users and portal has to be different in comparison to when the seeker sits in front of her computer. The portals must be better at predicting the needs of the user to provide ad-equate information without forcing the user to browse long indexes of suggested pages of information. For instance, searching the main Swedish health portal 1177.se with the query  X  X troke X  results in 214 suggested answers, but in a search log of the portal only 21 were chosen, with an average rank 1 of 3.8. The increased use of mobile devices and situa-tions with seekers in distress raise the question on how por-tal providers may be able both to better model , or describe, the user behaviour and to predict the impact of changes in search algorithms.

Inspired by the work by Parfionov and Zapatrin [6] on a model of information retrieval, and Parikh [7] on semantics and pragmatics, both with a basis in game theory , we show how these outlined challenges may be addressed and intro-duce a framework for descriptive and predictive analysis in the setting of health search. Moreover, by the foundations of the framework we are also able to address questions such as if the best way to improve the portal X  X  abilities may be to influence a changed seeker behaviour towards better expres-sion of her needs, instead of trying to cope with the existing user behaviour.

In the first section we briefly describe the official Swedish health portal used as a basis for the proceeding discussions. We also provide some preliminaries on game theory and the works by Parfionov and Zapatrin [6] and Parikh [7] to out-line a theoretical framework allowing both descriptive and predictive analyses, founded in well-known results of game theory [9]. Thereafter, we elaborate on current health search
The rank of a suggested answer is its position in the list of suggestions. challenges by studying how users search for stroke related information. This leads to the discussion on how the the-oretical framework may be used as a basis for establishing means to improve the portal X  X  usability, especially in a mo-bile setting, by trying to influence the seekers X  behaviour.
The internet site 1177.se is an official Swedish health por-tal, providing information on diseases, health and health care. The information is written by medical professionals and is available in different languages. It is a common web site for Swedish regions and counties, and 1177 is also the official national telephone number for health infomation and advice. Each part of 1177.se contains regional information on, for instance, local care givers or events. Through the portal it is possible to contact personal care givers to make appointments, renew prescriptions, etc over the internet. The search log we have studied is from the region V  X  astra G  X  otaland in south western Sweden with 1.5 million inhabi-tants. It covers the time period from June 2010 to Septem-ber 2011. The log contains 230,754 interactions, that is, pairs of queries and chosen results, grouped into sessions. It contains 31,054 queries most of which consist of between one and three words. For a more detailed description of the search log, see [2, 5].

To simplify the forthcoming discussions, we restrict our interest to sessions containing only one query. Moreover, our discussion is based on queries and chosen results from a stroke context, i.e. all links clicked after posting the query  X  X troke X  and all other queries leading to a click on one of these  X  X troke links X  (398 pairs of query and clicked link). Both queries and answers were manually sorted into cate-gories, e.g. disease, symptom, patient story or aetiology, re-flecting the different types of information which was searched for.
Assume we have a search log of pairs of queries and an-swers , i.e. clicked links, for a crowd A of information seekers and the portal B . 2 Let  X  A be the vector of probabilities  X  of query  X  i , and  X  B be the vector of probabilities  X  B swers  X  j , defined as the corresponding relative frequencies of queries and answers found in the log. 3
For the query-answer pair (  X  i , X  j ) we let a ij and b ij note the payoffs for the crowd A and portal B , respectively. Thereby, a ij &gt; a ik implies that the crowd prefers answer  X  j to  X  k for query  X  i , and b ij &gt; b kj that the portal consid-ers answer  X  j to better suit the query  X  i than  X  k . However, these preferences are in most cases unknown, since we do not know the rules adhered to by the crowd and portal. Still, we may view each query-answer pair as an equilibrium in the sense that neither part would have gained to deviate from their strategies as defined by the payoffs. In other words, the crowd passed the best possible query based on its infor-mation need and knowledge about the portal, and similarly the portal tried to answer the query as well as possible based
We assume each interaction to consist of one query and one answer. Many portals like 1177.se do not return only one result to a query, and we call the ones returned by the portal suggestions , or proposed answers .
This part is based on the work by Parfionov and Zapatrin [6]. on its understanding of the query and the crowd. 4 The (ex-pected) collective gain H A of the crowd and the portal H may then be defined as sums of payoffs for given queries and answers with respect to their probabilities of occurrence, possibly also considering the ranks 5 of the answers. By the theory of games [6], the behaviour  X  A of the crowd A of information seekers at equilibrium is completely de-cided by the payoffs b for the portal B , assuming both par-ties acted  X  X ationally X  [8]. Hence, to estimate the payoffs a of the crowd, we make use of the relative frequencies  X  B answers in the search log, and the frequencies  X  A of queries to decide the portal payoffs b . 6 Consequently, to study, or influence, the behaviour  X  A of the information seekers we may make use of the payoffs b , which can be derived from the frequencies  X  A in the search log. 7
In addition to Parfionov and Zapatrin X  X  [6] game-theoretic view of information search, we adapt Parikh X  X  model of se-mantics, describing the interaction as a situation-anchored sense-making game with a seeker trying to convey an inter-est by utterances hopefully interpreted in the intended way by the portal [7]. 8
Assume that the information seeker Ann types the query  X  X troke X  at a health information web site like 1177.se. The portal contains different kinds of information, and answers the query by, among other alternatives, a suggestion related to prevention of stroke and another one on how to treat it. This may be depicted as in Figure 1. When Ann passes the query  X  X troke X  (  X  ) to the portal, captured as a query  X  the search log, she is either with probability  X  1 in a situation s where she is interested in treatment of the disease, or with probability  X  2 in situation s 2 where she is interested in pre-vention of the disease. In the first case, after the utterance she will be in situation t 1 expecting treatment information, and in the latter case in t 2 expecting prevention information. However, the portal does not know in which one of these sit-uations she is, and consequently it does not know which type of answer  X  i she is interested in. In other words, it does not know whether to interpret Ann X  X  utterance as a treatment query  X  1 or as a prevention query  X  2 . Depending on the
In reality, portals like 1177.se return more than one sugges-tion, where the first one corresponds to the most preferred one by the portal, the second one the second most preferred etc. Hence, in a game-theoretic perspective we may say that the portal returns a mixed strategy of answers. We may gen-eralise the notion of preference to sets of proposed answers, by defining its payoff to be the one for the clicked link, i.e. answer. Hence, even a set of proposed answers with a high-ranked, but clicked, link would be as good as one with a chosen answer of lower rank. See also discussion below.
Suggestion  X  j has lower rank than  X  k , if  X  j occurs before  X  when both are presented as suggestions for a query. Ranks may be defined as a linear mapping from portal payoffs to the natural numbers.
For a more detailed discussion on the inverse problem of estimating payoffs and the relation to changed behaviour, see [6]. We may also consider the ranks of the answers, in the case of several suggestions returned by the portal.
Assuming a linear mapping between the rank of answers and their payoffs, we may use the rank as a means to influ-ence the behaviour of information seekers.
For a detailed formal description of Parikh X  X  work on a uni-fied theory of semantics and pragmatics based on game and situation theory as a framework for descriptive and prescrip-tive analysis of communication, see [7]. In this paper we re-strict our interest to adapting the terminology, presentation and intentions of Parikh X  X  work.
Figure 1: Game-theoretic view of communication. portal X  X  interpretation, Ann may end up in several differ-ent situations. In situations v 1 1 and v 2 2 she has obtained the desired types of suggestions, but in v 1 2 and v 2 1 she has not. This highlights the indeterminacy resulting from Ann not specifying her query. For instance, if she instead posted the query  X  X troke treatment X  (  X  1 ) she would end up in situation v with the expected suggestion from the portal. Similarly, if she posted the query  X  X troke prevention X  (  X  2 ) she would end up in situation v 2 .

The choices made by Ann and the portal to end up in the different final situations are in most cases not known to us, but we may assume that there are underlying payoffs a and b , respectively, and that the seeker and portal act rationally to maximise their gains. In terms of Parikh X  X  [7] framework, the payoffs may reflect how important it is to the parties that the communication, i.e. query-answer relation, is the intended one.

Finally, if the portal correctly  X  X uesses X  the situation t the information seeker, e.g. that Ann X  X  utterance  X  X troke X  (  X  ) is intended to indicate that she is in situation t pecting treatment information and this is also the portal X  X  interpretation of Ann X  X  utterance as a treatment query  X  1 Then we may say that the information seeker and the portal have reached an equilibrium . In terms of Parikh X  X  framework this balance is said to describe the content , or equilibrium semantics , of the interaction between the seeker and the por-tal. Thereby the search log may be seen as a transcript of the interactions between information seekers and the health portal trying to obtain semantic equilibria. 9
Combining these two views, a situation-anchored game theoretic description of the communication process expressed as a query-answer session offers a theoretic framework to model, or describe, information seeker and portal behaviours in a sense-making fashion. By its underlying theory it also results in an ability to predict outcomes of changed be-haviour.
When an information seeker passes a query to the portal she may be looking for information on, for instance, aetiol-ogy , symptoms , prevention , treatment , additional problems ,
This discussion was limited to sessions of only one query and answer, but may be extended to more complex queries and interactions in line with the work of Parikh [7]. general disease information or patient stories ( t i , Figure 1). The reason for searching may be that she, or a rela-tive, has symptoms of a disease, has (been diagnosed with) a disease or is generally curious about different aspects of a disease ( s i ). In the case of searching 1177.se with the query  X  X troke X , the answers, i.e. clicked links, were divided into ones related to aetiology (7.1%), prevention (22.5%), treatment (13.4%), additional problems (5.0%), general in-formation (10.1%) and patient stories (41.9%). However, the query and answer may not reveal which states, or sit-uations, the seeker was in when the interaction took place ( s , t i ).

Based on the different types of links the seeker has clicked after entering the search term, or utterance in Parikh X  X  [7] terminology, we can say that the seeker is in the correspond-ing state, or situation. For instance, if the seeker chooses a treatment link her state at search time was treatment seek-ing and her utterance was to be interpreted by the portal as a treatment query. Expressed in the terminology of Figure 1, the query  X  X troke X  corresponds to the utterance  X  , and v to v 1 6 to the states of the portal providing information on aetiology, prevention, treatment, additional problems, gen-eral information and patient stories with the seeker in, for instance, the state s 1 of having symptoms, disease or be-ing curious. Unfortunately, based only on the utterance the portal can not determine in which state t i the seeker is and thereby which type of information, or link, she would be interested in.

To understand the importance of the portal being able to  X  X redict X  the needs of the seeker, especially in a mobile context with interest in as few suggestions as possible, we can get some insights from statistics on how often different types of links have been chosen for a given query. However, there is a risk that the portal will choose the wrong type of suggestion. For instance, in our example in 41.9% of the cases the seeker seems to have an interest in other patients X  stories, hence there is a risk of 58.1% that the portal pro-poses an unwanted answer if it only considers the utterance, not taking into account the situation at hand. 10
Even if we assume we know the information seeker to be interested in stroke related answers, then treatment related queries such as  X  X hrombolysis X  may almost equally well in-dicate an interest in prevention (22.2% of the treatment re-lated queries), treatments (44.4%) or general information (33.3%) on stroke. For stroke related answers the disease name itself is the most common query, especially consid-ering topics like prevention, treatment and patient stories. The query  X  X troke X  is clearly the most common denomina-tor. For instance, in the case of an aetiology interest it made up 95.5% of the cases when a disease name was used as the query. Still in one third of the cases when the interest was the aetiology of stroke, symptoms like  X  X tress X  were used to obtain the relevant answers.

Receiving a long list of possible answers may not be fea-sible in a mobile setting where the ability for interaction by browsing among different suggestions is limited. For in-stance, people with an interest in aetiology (7.1%) are at risk of not being able to, among very few suggestions, find the relevant answer, and, making up less than 10% of the seekers in the stroke context, also are at risk of not being
The figures do not take into account the rank of the an-swers. Hence, this reflects the assumption that the chosen suggestion was always the most preferred one by the portal. counted for by portal improvements focusing on the major groups. Hence, the portal developers in the era of mobil-ity are faced with the challenge of improving their rankings, where in the case of people searching with the query  X  X troke X  links with an average rank of 4.6 were chosen. One approach to address this may be to try to improve the portal X  X  ability to interpret the utterances, i.e. to better decide adequate  X  . Another path may be to  X  X orce X  the seekers to improve their expressions, cf  X  vs  X  1 in Figure 1, thereby utilising the payoffs as a means to change the seekers X  behaviour.
The first approach may be the obvious path with emphasis on improving the portal interpreters. For instance, a basic approach to provide better answers is for the portal to try to predict the state t i (e.g. interest in stroke aetiology) of the seeker by letting her answer which of the, in this setting, six classes of information she is interested in. However, if the portal would try to be even more focused in its choice of suggestions, the seeker would have to choose from a large number of alternatives, and she would go from searching to browsing for relevant information. In our example, where aetiology is the second least chosen interest (7.1%), there is a risk that this type of suggestion would end up at the end of the proposed answers. In the second case, we may try to  X  X orce X  the information seeker to better define her interests by passing more  X  X etailed X  queries (  X  1 ). For in-stance, if the seeker would have used the utterance  X  X troke numbness X , symptom related queries in the context of stroke often (40.1%) led to accessing aetiology information. Hence, if we are able to change the behaviour of the seeker towards certain types of utterances (  X  1 ), then the risk of misinter-pretation by the portal would decrease and the seeker would obtain more adequate suggestions.

The theory of games provides an important insight by the result that assuming we are dealing with rational actors and our model of the interactions is accurate, then the only way to change the seekers X  behaviour is for the portal to change its own behaviour, i.e. the type of suggestions provided. Hence, improved algorithms, trying to interpret the seekers X  queries in better ways, may not be as fruitful as keeping existing interpretation methods and instead trying to impact the seekers X  query formulation, i.e. the behaviour of the information seekers.

As exemplified by Parfionov and Zapatrin [6], the theory of games does not only provide means to analyse decision problems like this, but also a framework for predicting the changed behaviour if portal payoffs, e.g. the ranking, are changed. In their work they show, in the case of a portal intended to only provide one answer for each query, how re-balancing the payoffs of the portal based on a weighted average of information seekers X  behaviour will induce more diversified queries from the seekers.
In this paper we have introduced a framework, based on game-theoretic models of information retrieval and commu-nication, allowing both descriptive and prescriptive mod-elling of seeker and portal behaviour. By an example, we also showed how query log statistics in combination with a game-theoretic view on information search suggests how improved interaction may be obtained by  X  X orcing X  seekers
See the discussion by Parfionov and Zapatrin [6] on equi-libria in search games. to consider queries which aim at framing the areas of inter-est. The hypothesis that improved portal performance may be obtained by forcing the seeker to change her behaviour, instead of trying to optimise the portal to address provided queries, is only one of the lessons learned by a game-theoretic approach. Much more research remains to fully exploit the abilities of this treatment of information search, especially in contexts like mobile devices where the interaction has to be concise. Moreover, it would also be interesting to use the outlined approach to simulate the evolution of information search behaviours.
