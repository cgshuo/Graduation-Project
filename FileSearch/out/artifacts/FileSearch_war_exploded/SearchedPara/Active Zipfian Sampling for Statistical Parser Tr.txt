 Wide coverage statistical parsers (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000) have proven to require large amounts of manually annotated data for training to achieve substantial performance. However, build-ing such large annotated corpora is very expensive in terms of human effort, time and cost (Marcus et al., 1993). Several alternatives of the standard super-vised learning setting have been proposed to reduce the annotation costs, one of which is active learning. Active learning setting allows the learner to select its own samples to be labeled and added to the training data iteratively. The motive behind active learning is that if the learner may select highly informative samples, it can eliminate the redundancy generally found in random data; however, informative sam-ples can be very untypical (Tang et al., 2002). Un-like random sampling, active learning has no guar-antee of selecting representative samples and untyp-ical training samples are expected to degrade test performance of a classifier.

To get around this problem, several methods of estimating representativeness of a sample have been introduced. In this study, we propose a novel rep-resentativeness estimator for a sentence, which is based on a modification of Zipf X  X  Principle of Least Effort (Zipf, 1949), theoretically sound and em-pirically validated on Brown corpus (Francis and Ku  X  cera, 1967). Experiments conducted with a wide coverage CCG parser (Clark and Curran, 2004; Clark and Curran, 2007) on CCGbank (Hocken-maier and Steedman, 2005) show that using our esti-mator as a representativeness metric never performs worse than and generally outperforms length bal-anced sampling (Becker and Osborne, 2005), which is another representativeness based active learn-ing method, and pure informativeness based active learning. In selective sampling setting, there are three criteria to be considered while choosing a sample to add to the training data (Dan, 2004; Tang et al., 2002): In-formativeness (what will the expected contribution of this sample to the current model be?), represen-tativeness (what is the estimated probability of see-ing this sample in the target population?) and diver-sity (how different are the samples in a batch from each other?). The last criterion applies only to the batch-mode setting, in which the training data is in-cremented by multiple samples at each step for prac-tical purposes.

Most of the active learning research in statistical parser training domain has focused on informative-ness measures developed for both single and multi-learner settings. The informativeness measures for single-learners that have exhibited significant per-formance in well known experimental domains are as follow: Selecting the sentences unparsable by the current model (and if the batch does not get filled, using a secondary method) (Thompson et al., 1999); selecting the sentences with the highest tree entropy , i.e. the Shannon entropy of parses the probabilistic parser assigns to the sentence (Hwa, 2004); select-ing the sentences having lowest best probabilities , where best probability is the conditional probability of the most probable parse, given the sentence and the current model (Osborne and Baldridge, 2004); primarily selecting the sentences that are expected to include events observed with low frequency so far with the help of bagging and filling the rest of the batch according to tree entropy, which is named as two-stage active learning by Becker and Os-borne (2005). Proposed informativeness measures for multiple learners and ensemble learners can be found in (Baldridge and Osborne, 2003; Osborne and Baldridge, 2004; Becker and Osborne, 2005; Baldridge and Osborne, 2008).

As for representativeness measures, Tang et. al. (2002) proposed using sample density , i.e. the inverse of the average distance of the sample to the other samples in the pool, according to some dis-tance metric. Becker and Osborne (2005) introduced length balanced sampling , in which the length his-togram of the batch is kept equal to the length his-togram of a random sample of batch size drawn from the pool. We introduce a novel representativeness measure for statistical parser training domain. Our measure is a function proposed in (Sigurd et al., 2004), which es-timates the relative frequencies of sentence lengths in a natural language. Sigurd et. al. (2004) claimed that the longer a sentence is, the less likely it will be uttered; in accordance with Zipf X  X  Principle of Least Effort (Zipf, 1935). However, too short sentences will appear infrequently as well, since the number of different statements that may be expressed using relatively fewer words is relatively smaller. Authors conjectured that there is a clash of expressivity and effort over the frequency of sentence length, which effort eventually wins. They formulated this behav-ior with a Gamma distribution estimating the relative frequencies of sentence lengths. Authors conducted a parameter fit study for English using Brown cor-pus (Francis and Ku  X  cera, 1967) and reported that the formula f ( L ) = 1 . 1  X  L 1  X  0 . 90 L , where L is the sentence length, fits to the observations with very high correlation.

We propose using this fitted formula (named f sentativeness of a sentence. This metric has sev-eral nice features: It is model-independent (so it is not affected from modeling errors), is both theoreti-cally sound and empirically validated, can be used in other NLP domains and is a numerical metric, pro-viding flexibility in combining it with informative-ness (and diversity) measures. 4.1 Experimental Setup We conducted experiments on CCGbank cor-pus (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2005) with the wide coverage CCG parser of Clark and Cur-enable us to use the whole available training data pool for sample selection in experiments, but not for training (since training C&amp;C parser is not that fast). Among the models implemented in the parser, the normal-form model is used. We used the default set-tings of the C&amp;C parser distribution for fair evalu-ation. WSJ Sections 02-21 (39604 sentences) are used for training and WSJ Section 23 (2407 sen-tences) is used for testing. Following (Clark and Curran, 2007), we evaluated the parser performance using the labeled f-score of the predicate-argument dependencies produced by the parser.
For each active learning scheme and random sam-pling, the size of the seed training set is 500 sen-tences, the batch size is 100 sentences and itera-tistical significance, each experiment is replicated 5 times. We evaluate the active learning performance in terms of Percentage Reduction in Utilized Data , i.e. how many percents less data is used by AL compared to random sampling, in order to reach a certain performance score. Amount of used data is measured with the number of brackets in the data. In CCGbank, a bracket always corresponds to a parse decision, so it is a reasonable approximation of the amount of annotator effort.

Our measure is compared to length balanced sam-pling and using no representativeness measures. Since there is not a trivial distance metric between CCG parses and we do not know a proposed one, we could not test it against sample density method. We limited the informativeness measures to be tested to the four single-learner measures we mentioned in Section 2. Multi-learner and ensemble methods are excluded, since the success of such methods re-lies heavily on the diversity of the available mod-els (Baldridge and Osborne, 2004; Baldridge and Osborne, 2008). The models in C&amp;C parser are not diverse enough and we left crafting such diverse models to future work.

We combined f measures as follow: With tree entropy, sentences with the highest f f is the tree entropy of the sentence s under the cur-rent model G , normalized by the binary logarithm of the number of parses, following (Hwa, 2004). With lowest best probability, sentences with the high-est f lected, where f (see Section 2). With unparsed/entropy, we primar-ily chose the unparsable sentences having highest f according to f learning, we primarily chose sentences that can be parsed by the full parser but not the bagged parser and have the highest f darily chose sentences that cannot be parsed by both parsers and have the highest f third priority is given to sentences having highest f sampling with all of these informativeness measures is straightforward. For statistical significance, a dif-ferent random sample is used for length histogram in each replication of experiment. 4.2 Results Results can be seen in Figure 1 and Table 1. Due to lack of space and similarity of the graphs of un-parsed/entropy and LBP, we excluded the graph of unparsed/entropy (but its results are included in Ta-ble 1). Since observation points in different lines do not fall on the exactly same performance level (for exact PRUD measurement), we took the points on as closest f-score levels as possible. With tree entropy, Zipfian sampling performs almost as good as pure informativeness based AL and with two-stage AL, length balanced sampling performs almost as good as Zipfian sampling. In all other comparisons, Zip-fian sampling outperforms its alternatives substan-tially. We introduced a representativeness measure for ac-tive learning in statistical parser training domain, based on an empirical sentence length frequency model of English. Experiments on a wide cover-age CCG parser show that this measure outperforms the alternative measures most of the time and never hinders. Our study can be extended via further ex-perimentation with the methods we excluded in Sec-tion 4.1, with other parsers, with other languages and with other Zipfian cues of language (e.g. Zipf X  X  law on word frequencies (Zipf, 1949)).
