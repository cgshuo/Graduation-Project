This work is part of the MIRROR project funded by the Europe-an Commission in FP 7. The MIRROR projects aims at support-ing reflection in various settings, stages and levels.

Based on this analysis, which form an initial framework and plans for the continuation of its underlying research. Reflection is a common activity at workplaces.

Reflection means to mentally return sarily lead to outcomes in a line ar fashion, but make reflection an and sustain good practice. Reflection in this sense means learning from experiences and has been identified as a decisive mechanism in modern workplaces [1, 2, 14]. Sch X n [20] added that there is a differentiation between reflection  X  X n action X , which is happening Although Sch X n originally focused on individual reflection in this that both modes pose different ne eds and constraints for support. Reflection needs to be differentiated from other forms of thinking reflection process. Reflection is al so close to problem-based learn-ing [20], which requires reflecti on on experiences past with prob-solved by reflecting on their past occurrences in practice.

Among tools for more special pur pose reflection support, the Mi-crosoft SenseCam, which takes pictures when the scenery in front of it changes, has been reported to support reflection well, even in knowledge of the authors, besides this and very few other special reflection available. What can be seen from these few examples is context of work practice, acting as a socio-technical solution [6]. issues such as diagnosis [17, 24] and training for work [9, 17]. mostly triggered by medical proble ms such as difficult diagnoses.

Typical applications environments that sta ff (especially physicians) holds meetings and discusses patients and their states. Reflection is considered to be an important practice of nurses and caretakers in training before and on the job, as these groups need to develop a habit of critical thinking and to gradually adopt good using a journal to write down experiences and learn from them for face to face communication and reflection [9]. create better work practice at such workplaces. Thus, aspects such as work organization and social issu es also need to be regarded in provide details on reflection proce sses or needs in such cases. flection.

Its concept was also tested for the collaborative reflection of nursing work by using a paper prototype.
