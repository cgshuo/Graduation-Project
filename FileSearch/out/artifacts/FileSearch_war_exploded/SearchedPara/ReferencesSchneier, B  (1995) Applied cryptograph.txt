Mobile Database Systems, Vijay, Kumar. Wiley-Interscience Inc., Hoboken, NJ (June 30, 2006). $99.95, ISBN: 0-471-46792-8 The present mobile infrastructure is only sufficient to provide data to the users from the server to client end.
It is not yet possible to perform transactional activities using the currently adopted mobile database frame-work, which do not allow the users to query the data on demand and achieve desired results. This book de-scribes the research work done in the field of Mobile Database Systems (MDS) where the testing of the new database transactional models for MDS is discussed in great detail.

In Mobile Database Systems , Vijay Kumar has started his book with the history and evolution of the wire-less era since the World War I to the present. He then discusses the architecture of cellular communication including Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) call processing. Kumar then introduces various database concepts and describes various database transactional models and database recovery models.
Finally, he presents various analyses of wireless broadcast modes and important protocols involved in wireless dissemination technology.

The title of the book is very catchy and self-explanatory. Overall, the book is interesting and easy to read, and the flow of the text material in the book is maintained. The naming conventions used in the chapters are easy to follow. The author intends the main audience of this book to be the people in the academy who have interests in Mobile Database Systems. The case studies and the examples discussed in a few chapters provide a good context for learners to understand the topic and its applications better.
 Dr. Vijay Kumar is a Professor of School of Computing and Engineering at the University of
Missouri  X  Kansas City campus. His institutional record includes an undergraduate degree in Physics and a M.Sc. in Crystallography from Ranchi University in India. He then achieved other Computer Science degrees:
His teaching interests are primarily focused on database systems and mobile computing technology. Kumar has received various research grants in his fields of interest from the National Science Foundation (NSF). His current research projects include:
The book is divided into nine chapters with a highly informative introduction and summary. The lan-guage of the text is simple, and easy to understand, and comprehensible. Chapter 1 on Mobile Database Sys-tem focuses on the notion of the advantage of the free flow information to mobile users. There is brief history of the wireless technologies dating back from the World War era to the present times. The concepts of terminal and personal mobility are well explained. Chapter 2 on Wireless Network Communication covers the architecture of cellular systems with their individualistic compatibility problems leading to the emergence of Personal Communication System (PCS) and Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) technologies.

Kumar has described the handoff process of a mobile unit (MU) and covered the topic of finding or locating a Mobile Unit (MU) geographically in Chapter 3, Location and Handoff Management . The basics of database processing are covered in Chapter 4, Fundamentals of Database Technology . The author has presented the information related to the problems in database conflicts in a summarized form with examples, which are confusing to understand. Kumar has even proposed some advanced transaction models for database process-ing. He explained various concurrency control mechanisms and cites different schemes for locking data in Chapter 5 Introduction to Concurrency Control Mechanisms .
 Chapter 6 on Data Processing and Mobility provides very good real-time examples of the future of Mobile
Database Systems technology. Kumar tries to focus on the traveling usefulness of this technology and the amount of time that can be saved. Three types of connectivity nodes and their effect on database consistency and transaction processing are explained. The author follows this with a detailed discussion on management of transactions in MDS and the relationship of database consistency to transaction execution models with var-ious examples in Chapter 7, Transaction management in Mobile Database Systems .

The Chapter 8 on Mobile Database Recovery introduces fundamentals of conventional database recov-ery protocols and techniques. Some of the mobile database recovery schemes are presented and discussed in more detail. However, according to the author, there is a need for doing more research in this domain before this technology can be implemented. Finally, Chapter 9, Wireless Information Broadcast , presents the research work done in the dissemination of data through wireless channels. The analysis of different data downloading methods and indexing schemes are provided with their specific architecture. The concept of DAYS (Data in Your Space) was also introduced. DAYS is a project which is being investigated by
Kumar et al. with the main goal providing a user with the capability to pull the desired information from any geographic location or at any time from the space, process it, and push it to any location in the space.

This book reports on a lot of research work, which has also been tested but not yet implemented. According to the author, none of these models are used commercially. But, I fail to understand the main difference be-tween a commercial mobile database system and the database systems presently used in mobile appliances such as Blackberries and Palm Treos X  . The book fails to mention these real world technologies, which were in use way before the book was even published.

Most of the chapters had either very few citations or a very long list of citations. This may suggest that the author did not devote as much time to the development of those chapters. The author could have in-cluded more highly filtered information in those chapters. Also, the author has assumed all learners have a very sound knowledge of database systems in general. This could become a significant weakness. There are a few chapters in which the author has repeated the same concepts numerous times. Regardless of these shortcomings, the book can be revised thoroughly in its second edition and it is advisable to increase the scope for its readers.

This book could serve as a research reference for various topics such as database concepts, database trans-actional models, data-consistency schemes, data recovery models, and data dissemination schemes. Student researches in the field of mobile computing will find this book very useful in discovering many other research problems.

Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Connecticut. He is a veteran airman and he has been a part of the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), as a visiting research scientist. He currently holds two patents and is Deputy Director of the Information Awareness Office, the Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on
Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC), and the Chairman of IEEE SMC Society X  X  Adaptive Computative Sys-tems Technical Committee (DARPA, 2005).

Dr. Yen is a Professor of Information Science and Technology (IST), at Pennsylvania State. His area of expertise includes artificial intelligence (AI), automated reasoning, antiterrorism and agent-based collabora-tive technologies. He received his doctorate from the University of Berkley in California. He has been involved in a project to develop processes of a tactical operations center (TOC), funded by the Army Digitization Office. The DOD, the Army Research Lab (ARL), and Dell have utilized him in their efforts.
 The purpose of their book was a review of how to use technology to overcome security threats to the United
States. America does not know exactly whom the new enemy is, as discovered by the authors as they compared modern war to past wars. The introduction of the book begins by stating the problem:  X  X  X he current enemy does not follow the Geneva Convention; the current enemy does not see weapons of mass destruction as a last resort; the current enemy uses cell phones, Internet, financial systems, the press and an array of media to accomplish their tasks; and the enemy moves freely throughout the world using legal weapons X  X . Failed states are defined as lawlessness, hatemongering and thuggish states where leaders seek revenge, kill opposition, retaliate against perceived humiliations and do not have the best interest of their people in mind. Failed states appear to be breeding grounds for terrorists.
 Iraq and Afghanistan have shown military success in pre and post conflict through conducted Stability
Operations that require a deep social awareness of the threats and operational environment in which they re-side. Winning the hearts and minds of the local population is an important stage in instilling a sense of equal-ity and successfully completing a stability operation. What Information Technology can support these feats? What IT can accurately label and detect signatures of terrorists prior to attacks?
The book assumes you know what 9/11 means to an American, that you know American history basics and that you agree with the opinion that there were detectable clues before 9/11; but the clues were generally not understood until after the fact. The point of the book is to detect these signatures prior to large events. The authors do not present a negative opinion of the agencies of the United States.

This book begins with patterns of difference human phenomena in relation to social sciences (i.e. anthro-pology and psychology), to establish the threat. Among the topics discussed is qualitative/computational tech-nologies used for failed state analysis. This includes many levels of use and verifies validity of key elements with research and experiments. This gives a layout of discovering what the threat is. In a number of the begin-ning sections, the wars in the history of the United States are compared to the War on Terrorism to compare the differences in battles and displaying the need for IT.
