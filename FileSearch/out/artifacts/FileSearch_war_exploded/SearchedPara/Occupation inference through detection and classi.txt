Biographical information can be used to answer questions other than the score gets the correct answer to the questions  X  When did Leonardo da Vinci paint the Mona Lisa? search queries seem to contain references to people. Guha et al. [27] describe search over a semantic web where web is not a web of documents, but a web of relations between resources denoting real world objects. of having real world objects linked to each other. For example, when asked about network of objects. This network encodes information that Yo-Yo Ma is a link  X  birth place  X  ,to  X  10/07/55  X  by the link  X  birth date the cellist Yo-Yo Ma. 3
