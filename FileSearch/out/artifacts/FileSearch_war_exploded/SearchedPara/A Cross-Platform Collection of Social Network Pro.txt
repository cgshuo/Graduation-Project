 The proliferation of Internet-enabled devices and services has led to a shifting balance between digital and analogue aspects of our everyday lives. In the face of this develop-ment there is a growing demand for the study of privacy hazards, the potential for unique user de-anonymization and information leakage between the various social media pro-files many of us maintain. To enable the structured study of such adversarial effects, this paper presents a dedicated dataset of cross-platform social network personas ( i.e. , the same person has accounts on multiple platforms). The cor-pus comprises 850 users who generate predominantly En-glish content. Each user object contains the online footprint of the same person in three distinct social networks: Twit-ter, Instagram and Foursquare. In total, it encompasses over 2.5M tweets, 340k check-ins and 42k Instagram posts. We describe the collection methodology, characteristics of the dataset, and how to obtain it. Finally, we discuss a common use case, cross-platform user identification.

The field of computational social science and data-driven research is growing in importance [9], and with this trend, there is a need for common academic benchmarking collec-tions to facilitate a robust and reproducible research envi-ronment. In practice, however, datasets are often obtained via ad-hoc collection, or on the basis of proprietary data.
While originally Online Social Networks (OSNs) focused on allowing users to communicate, connect with others and share content, nowadays the term includes platforms which are primarily user-centric, allowing members to broadcast personal thoughts and content. [8] finds that OSNs are among the most frequently visited Web sites for a large pop-ulation of users. In consequence, they can be used to study human behaviour at a large scale. Furthermore, because many OSNs are public by default and provide APIs to ac-cess their content, they have become good candidates for data collection to be used to study problems such as user/ topic modelling, user identification or information leakage.
In this paper, we introduce a collection of 850 users and their online footprint (part of their generated content and user profiles) spread across three social networks: Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare. It is our objective to provide a dataset on which privacy-sensitive methods and the defense against them can be tested. The construction of this dataset was initially carried out during a research project studying cross platform privacy loss arising from public information sharing on social networks [4]. In Table 1, a comparison of our dataset with other existing corpora is given.

Our data collection method relies on linking users across three popular OSN platforms. Twitter is a microblogging platform whose main content comes in tweets , posts limited to 140 characters which can contain text, video or images, links to external Web sites, references to other users and hashtags (terms starting with the # symbol used to mark keywords or topics in a tweet). Instagram is a photo sharing platform. Its main content are photos or videos along with optional textual descriptors. Foursquare is a location service platform concentrating on the notion of check-ins .
The paper makes the following novel contributions (1) We describe the methodology and release the code to construct a user-centric cross-OSN dataset. (2) We release a dataset of 850 profile triples across the aforementioned OSNs. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, we present the methodology used to create the collection. Section 3 presents key statistics and qualitative aspects of the dataset. Section 4 discusses the task of cross-platform user identification as an example use case before sketching a range of further conceivable use cases and tasks.
We use Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare mainly due to the ease of crawling and publicly accessible APIs, but also because the content generated by the users in these distinct social networks is diverse and representative of a comprehensive range of OSN use cases. In [11], the authors find that on Twitter, the top types of content users share are: personal information, random thoughts, opinions/com-plaints and facts ( e.g. news). While on Instagram, the ma-Flickr, Google+, Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter, Youtube jority of the posted pictures can be put in 1 of 8 categories, with the leading categories being selfies and friends [5]. On Foursquare, users share their location in terms of venues, which carries not only information in the form of raw ge-ographic coordinates, but often also the venue X  X  name and function.

In order to obtain profiles from different OSNs belonging to the same person, we first use the Twitter Search API to search for specific post patterns ( e.g. , https://instagr.am/ p/*), in order to identify users who cross-post content from other platforms on Twitter. A graphical depiction of the collection process is shown in Figure 1.
 The data was collected in January and February 2016. While we were able to find over 5000 profile triples, only ap-proximately 20% of these triples fulfill our criteria of actively using the three selected OSNs, posting predominantly in En-glish and sharing content publicly. After enforcing these re-quirements, our dataset contains a total of 850 distinct user profiles.
We focused on profiles with predominantly English con-tent as the initial study for which the data was collected was a natural language processing task that would have suffered from excessive amounts of cross-language content.

In order to guarantee that the majority of the content is posted in English, we use the method described in Algo-rithm 1. We set the ratio to be 0 . 1 and K = 100 for our collection. The purpose is not to exclude users that occa-sionally post in a non-English language, but to make sure the data set does not contain too many strictly non English-speaking users.

To increase the confidence that users are authentic per-sonal accounts instead of spammers that merely redistribute content from other users, we have a simple heuristic de-scribed in Algorithm 2. We take the timeline of the user from the respective OSN and we check whether the majority of the posts come from the same user name. In our collec-tion, the threshold is set to 30%. Suspected spammer triples are flagged but, for completeness, remain in the dataset.
Our 850 authentic English-speaking users produced ap-proximately 2.5M tweets, 340k check-ins and 42k Instagram posts 1 . Four users were flagged as spammers under the rule described in Section 2.2.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of tweets per user. Figures 3 and 4 show the distribution of number of check-ins and Instagram posts per user, respectively.

The Twitter API restricts access to at most 3200 tweets per profile (including re-tweets) [13]. Because we exclude direct re-tweets from our data set, the majority of the Twit-ter profiles we collect contain between 3000 and 3200 tweets. For each Instagram profile, we recover the most recent posts through the Instagram API and complement them with ex-isting content which has been posted on Twitter. For each Foursquare profile, we recover those check-ins that were cross-posted on the retrieved Twitter timeline.

In this dataset, we observe check-ins from 111 countries, spawning 669 venue types. The most visited venue types are shown in Figure 5. For each user we store Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare IDs along with the tweet and post IDs of all shared con-tent. The Foursquare data is represented as a list of tuples ( venue id, tweet id ), where tweet id is the tweet announcing the check-in. An example of the collected user data is shown in Table 2. For copyright reasons, we do not distribute the content but instead provide the scripts to crawl the data [1]. Using these scripts, the following can be retrieved: http://cake.da.inf.ethz.ch/OSN-sigir2016/ profile through their respective APIs.

In this section we present a use case for this dataset in a cross-OSN user identification task. Then, we elaborate on other tasks that can find this collection useful.
The task of user identification is concerned with match-ing profiles from different domains belonging to the same natural person [14]. In this scenario, we use Instagram and Twitter as our data sources. A simple, yet powerful base-line algorithm is used, which compares the similarity of the nicknames on the respective platforms.

By assigning minimal Levenshtein distance between user names and choosing the one with the lowest edit distance, we attain a matching accuracy of 70.1%. If the user names are preprocessed by converting them to lowercase (as in both these social networks the letter case does not make a differ-ence), we attain an accuracy of 72.8%. One can think of many more advanced schemes tracking common topics or writing styles across social networks.
In [2], the authors study how users behave across Pinter-est and Twitter. Other papers study Twitter or Instagram alone [11, 5]. It would be interesting to study the behaviour of users in these OSNs while having access to their multi-ple profiles. This could help answer whether some topics are OSN-specific or whether the activity in one profile can indicate future activity in another profile.
Following the idea that an activity on one platform can indicate future activity on another one, an interesting study would be to see whether it is possible to infer information from one OSN regarding another one. For example, whether it is possible to predict topics, interests or intentions. An example of this type of work can be found in [4], where the authors use Twitter timelines to infer venue type visits.
Because OSNs can carry different information depending on their functionality, the access to several profiles from the same user across different platforms might give an advantage when modelling the user. These user models can be used for targeted advertisement or recommender systems. An interesting task would be to compare whether the inclusion of different profiles can benefit the models or not.
In this paper, we described the collection, structure and properties of a benchmarking corpus of cross-platform OSN user profiles useful for a wide range of privacy-related re-search questions. It encompasses hundreds of user triples, millions of tweets and thousands of Instagram and Foursquare posts. In order to reduce the inherent amount of noise in the dataset, we ensure a focus on English-speaking users and perform spammer identification. To the best of our knowl-edge, this dataset is the first of its kind both in nature as well as scale.
