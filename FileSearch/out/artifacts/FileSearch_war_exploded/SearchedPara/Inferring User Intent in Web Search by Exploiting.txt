 In this paper, we present a folksonomy-based approa ch for im-plicit user intent extraction during a Web search p rocess. We present a number of result re-ranking techniques ba sed on this representation that can be applied to any Web searc h engine. We perform a user experiment the results of which indi cate that this type of representation is better at context extract ion than using the actual textual content of the document.

These systems encourage users to tag different types of c ontent items in a way that enhances their organization and sharing. The domains of these systems are varied, including music (e.g., Last.fm), photo streams (e.g. Flickr), or Web pages (e.g. Delicious ). However, even with the aid of currently available tools, use rs still have problems accessing the ever increasing information available on the Web, which is known as the information overload problem. Personalized and contextualized content access has aimed in recent years to alleviate the information overload problem on the Web by taking both long and short term interests of users into account. Additionally, the underlying semantic info rmation gener-ated by users in social tagging systems, known as folksonomies , has enabled the research and development of new eff ective re-trieval and personalized methods. Folksonomies have been recent-ly exploited in order to, for instance, improve [1] or personalize [4] Web search, by exploiting the implicit user and document profiles that can be extracted by mining the social tagging actions of users. In this paper, we investigate whether social taggin g systems can be a new information source for the runtime constru ction and representation of users X  search intent, i.e. if thi s information can be interpreted as a new source of (implicit) search context. We focus our research on Web search and the use of Del icious social bookmarking service. We hypothesize that soc ial tagging systems such as Delicious can be a valuable source of information in order to elucidate the semantics involved in the search process of the user. Context-aware models based on implicit feedback rely on processing the content of the executed queries a nd accessed documents by users during search activities [5]. Th is information is used to build a representation of the current se arch context of the user that can be leveraged in subsequent querie s of a search session. Here we investigate the application of suc h techniques to a folksonomy-based representation of Web documents.
 This use of social tagging information for user int ent extraction has not been investigated in depth before. An initi al approach to the exploitation of Delicious as a context source h as been pre-sented by Schmidt et al. [3], who extract the tags related to the documents opened by the user, and apply them in que ry expan-sion, using an ad-hoc decay factor that gives more importance to recently opened documents. However, no evaluation i s provided in this work, so the feasibility of folksonomy-base d context repre-sentation lacks a formal empirical study, to the be st of our knowl-edge. Rather than on query expansion [3],[5], our a pproach is based on result re-ranking, as we focus on raising the precision of the top results presented to the user rather than i mproving recall, as users are prone to only inspect the top results returned by Web search engines. We also investigate more formal con text construc-tion strategies [5], such as the ostensive model [2 ]. Similar to [1],[4], we exploit Delicious as the soc ial annotation corpus to improve Web search, but we focus on provi ding a con-text-aware search to the user, rather than implemen ting a popular-ity measure [1] or a personalized search [4]. Diffe rently from [4], our approach does not require the user to have a va lid user profile in the system. Instead, we build a short term profi le at runtime, based on the implicit information provided by the u ser during the search process and the available tagging informatio n provided by users of the social tagging service. 1 We define a folksonomy F as a tuple F = T , U , D , T = , ... , is the set of tags that comprise the vocabulary expressed by the folksonomy, U = , ... , and D = ments that annotate and are annotated with the tags of A = X  U  X  T  X  D is the set of annotations of the form by a user . The profile of document is defined as a vector the number of times the document has been annotated with tag . In our Web search scenario, the set of documents D represents the resources present on the Web, and are identifie d by a URL. In order to represent the search process of the use r, we define a query trail, = , , ... , ,  X  D , as a query and an ordered set of documents in the result set that the user has ac-cessed after issuing the query. We can then define a session trail, = , ... , ! as an ordered set of query trails that are related Delicious -Social bookmarking, http://delicious.c om/ to the current search session of the user. When the user executes a query, the current session trail can be analyzed in order to infer a folksonomy-based representation of the user X  X  searc h context. We define a context representation C , t # as a weighting func-tion that scores the importance of a given tag t # based on its degree of relation to the user X  X  current session trail . We based our context representation techniques on the ostensive model [2]: where ' is a weight factor that takes into consideration t he order of the query trails, i.e. how recently within the curr ent session the query trails occurred. * , is a weighting function that indicates how well tag represents document . By varying the ' parame-ter we can obtain different implicit context repres entation models [5]. For instance, for ' &lt; 1 the context function represents the standard ostensive model [2], where documents that the user opened recently are taken more into consideration for the context represen-tation. In this case ' is regarded as a reduction factor. With ' = 1 we represent an accumulative model where all opened documents have the same importance when representing the user  X  X  context. With an ' &gt; 1 documents opened at the beginning of the search session have more importance when representing the user X  X  context. We analyze two different weighting functions: 1) a weighting func-tion 4-6 4 , , that uses the 4-6 4 value of a tag using the frequency value; and 2) a weighting function th at takes also into consideration the viewing time of the document, by multiplying the previous function by a factor , given by the time in seconds that the user spent viewing the document. We then use this context representation to re-rank the results of the Web search system. Result documents are re-orde red by the similarity value between the document and the current context of the user, taking into account the original ranki ng. We define this similarity value as a scalar product: 67 , = &amp; $ 8 , t . Finally, in order to take into account the actual query of the user, the new ordered result list is aggrega ted with the original result list using CombSUM with rank based normalization. In order to test different context-aware adaptation techniques, we defined three search tasks and monitored 14 users w hile performing each task for 15 minutes. The tasks were performed on a common Web browser. All user interactions were collected u sing a query and action log toolbar 2 . In order to act as a baseline, we instructed user s to use Microsoft X  X  Bing 3 Web search engine when performing a Web search. As a way to obtain relevance judgments, users were instructed to bookmark those results they found int eresting for their tasks, but they were not asked to find as many rele vant documents as they could. Our intention was that users deviate as little as possi-ble from their normal search methodology. The three search tasks were designed to emulate common search situations. These were: 1) planning a holiday trip; 2) searching for a new ele ctronic product you are interested in buying; and 3) an open task w ere users could search on any topic of their interest. When each ta sk was finished users had 5 additional minutes to judge an aggregat ed list of results that appeared during their search session, in order for us to obtain more relevance judgements. The above information co nstituted our evaluation topics. It is worth noting that the cove rage of Delicious Lemur toolbar: http://www.lemurproject.org/querylo gtoolbar/ Microsoft Bing: http://www.bing.com was 38% for accessed documents and 51% for accessed documents that users marked as relevant. Figure 1 presents the results of the evaluation. In order to test our hypothesis, we compare the ranking results of the a pproaches presented in the previous section (tag source) with the same ap-proaches when using the actual textual content of t he documents as its representation (text source). The combination o f both sources is not shown as it did not produce better results. As a baseline, we use the original ranking provided by Bing (baseline). S ome of the evaluated approaches were our representation techni ques with varying values of ' : ' = 0.5 (ostensive), ' = 1.0 (accumulated), and ' = 1.5 (begin). These three techniques used the 4-6 4 weighing function. We also show the performance of the accumu-lated technique with the time weighting factor (acu m + time). In addition, we adapted the technique presented by Sch midt et al. [3], although their work was originally designed for que ry expansion. As a metric we show MAP at a cut-off point of the t op 50 results. Other metrics such as P@10 and NDCG give similar re sults. Table 1: MAP@50 performance of context-aware techni ques The results show that the context-aware approaches had signifi-cantly better results when using the folksonomy-bas ed representa-tion of documents than their actual content. These differences were statistically significant for all approaches (Wilco xon, p&lt; 0.05). Additionally, only the folksonomy-based approaches resulted in an improvement over the baseline, also with statistica l significance. From the analysis of the results we can conclude th at in our experi-ment the variations of the ' parameter produced no significant effect. The best performing approach was the combin ation of the accumulated approach and the time sensitive weighti ng function, which achieved a 15% improvement over the best tech nique based on textual content and a 4.5% increase over the bas eline. To conclude, we have presented a number of approach es in order to evaluate folksonomy-based context representation techniques. Our results validate our hypothesis that the folkso nomy-based representation and exploitation of the user context is more effective than traditional approaches based on the content of the document.
