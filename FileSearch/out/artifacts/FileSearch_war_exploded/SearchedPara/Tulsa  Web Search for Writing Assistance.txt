 H.3 Information Storage Retrieval: Online Information Services Management, Design, Human Factors, Language. Searching the web while authoring has become a common behavior for many users. Some search the web to research content, while others, especially those writing in a foreign language, search to learn if their usage is appropriate. Can we unify the experiences of search and writing to make authoring more productive? That X  X  the central question of project Tulsa, which puts the web at writers X  fingertips in a novel writing assistance experience based on implicit web search and natural language techniques. It provides assistance at three levels: word, phrase and paragraph. Tulsa offers web-mined , contextual reference information and suggestions for completing or revising words and phrases. Paragraph analysis is also provided which can detect outlier usage of language in larger chunks of text . Tulsa bases its suggestions and rankings on the Web as Corpus (WaC) through sea rch engine queries, combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on N-gram language features of a web-scale language model. In our demo, Tulsa is realized as an add-in to a word processing application with three key features .  X  X ense  X  enables word and phrase contextual suggestions.  X  X nalysis X  examines the document text to suggest potential language errors . And  X  X ilingual Mode X  makes writing in a foreign language easier. Sense: The primary feature of Tulsa,  X  X ense, X  provides word and phrase completion in addition to revision suggestions which exploit writing context.  X  X ense  X  operates in three writing scenarios. The first is word complete, which occurs when the cursor is at the end of a word; Tulsa provides auto-completion results derived from a web-based dictionary. Second is the revision scenario, which occurs when the cursor is within a word; Tulsa suggests statistically more likely alternatives according to the context . To achieve this, a web-scale language model [1][2] is leveraged along with search engine hit numbers to train a SVM model. After training, each suggestion candidate is assigned a pro bability score for ranking the top N shown to the user (Figure 1). The third scenario is sentence complete, and occurs when the space key is entered after a word; Tulsa offers web-based suggestions to complete the phrase or sentence. Figure 2 shows the interface of Tulsa in the revision scenario.
