 Clinical narrative in the medical record provides perhaps the most detailed account of a patient X  X  history. However, this inform ation is documented in free -text, which makes it challenging to analyze. Efforts to index unstructured clinical narrative often focus on identifying predefined concepts from clinical terminologies . Less studied is the problem of analyzing the text as a whole to create temporal indices that capture relationships between learned clinical events . Topic models provide a method for analyzing large corpora of text to discover s emantically related clusters of words . This work presents a topic model tailored to the clinical reporting environment that allows for individual patient timelines. Results show t he model is able to identify patterns of clinical events in a cohort of brain cancer patients. H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Information filtering.
 Algorithms . Topic model, clinical reports , brain cancer . Due to the complexity of language, the variability in author narrative can be challenging to analyze from a computer X  X  perspective. Topic models, such as l atent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) , provide a method for indexing large unstructured corpora with inferred semantics [ 1]. Extensions to the LDA model have been proposed that include modeling time [ 2], finding correlations between topics [ 3], learning image -word annotations [4], performing automatic translation [ 5], and lear ning topic hierarchies [6]. Additionally, p revious work has demonstrated the application of LDA in the clinical domain for case-based reasoning [7] . However, t o date there is no model designed collection of documents that details the progression of disease. We propose a topic model that captures temporal topic patterns in an individual patient X  X  medical record , while being sensitive to the entire patient population. Similar to [ 2], we present a model that links topics to time within a corpus by observing a timestamp for each document and using a beta distribution to model a topic X  X  expression in t he collection over time. However, we modify the model for application in the We investig ated the use of the proposed topic model in a population of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive brain cancer. For each patient we used any report that conveyed clinical information in natural language (e.g., discharge summaries , radi ology reports , pathology reports , etc. ). Patients were required to have a minimum of five reports to be included in the model . Reports were preprocessed to remove stop words , rare and common words, and a set of medical stop words , such as  X  X r. X ,  X  X eport X ,  X  X ictated X , and  X  X D X . In a general context these medical stop words may prove useful, but limited to the domain of clinical reporting they offer little semantic meaning. The resulting corpus contained 303 patients, 13,028 reports, 2,412,385 words, and 1 ,37 4 unique words. Each patient X  X  document collection was normalized to the timespan (0,1) and 100 topics were fit in 1000 iterations. As in [2], we used symmetric Dirichlet priors of  X  = 50/T and  X  = 0.1.
 The resulting to pics and temporal patterns were reviewed by a neuroradiologist and were found to correlate with valid sequences of clinical events. For example, we observed that the topic describing radiation treatment is generally preceded by the topic describing the sur gical resection of a tumor. Table 1 presents several topics learned by the model and Figure 2 shows the topic timeline of a patient from the collection. As expected, because topics are learned across all patients, we found that generally patients exhi bit o nly a subset of all possible topics . For example, some patients have tumors considered inoperable and therefore do not express a surgical resection topic. Patients with large num bers of documents can bias the distribution of words in a topic . W ith a large enough collection of patients these biases may even out, but it is likely that the differences in numbers of documents per patient are systematic (e.g., patients with newly discovered late stage tumors may die quickly and therefore have few doc uments). This may be corrected by estimating topics through sampling word topic counts from patients as a proportion of their number of documents.
 We observed that while general temporal trends were found, there were cases of topic expression that conflict ed with actual patient care. For example, we identified patients who began physical therapy before receiving any treatment for a tumor. This discrepancy is due to the fact that although relative temporal topic relationships hold across patients, they are e xpressed at different points within each patient X  X  timeline.
