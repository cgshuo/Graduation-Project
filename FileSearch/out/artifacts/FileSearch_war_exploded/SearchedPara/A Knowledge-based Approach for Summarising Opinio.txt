 The popularity of on-line resources, which allow users to review products or services, is motivating new interest in the area of Sen-timent Analysis [3]. An important task is the classification of doc-uments according to the overall sentiment, i.e. whether positive or negative. A common behaviour among reviewers is to summarise the overall sentiment of the review in a single sentence, or in a short passage. On the other hand, the rest of the review can express a feeling which is different from the overall judgement. This can be explained by the presence of several aspects or features that the reviewers want to comment on. Traditional summarisation tech-niques [2] are not always suitable for building opinion-based sum-maries, and more sentiment-oriented approaches are needed. In this research, we investigate the use of summarisation techniques applied to reviews, and we propose a knowledge-based approach to summarisation, in the context of sentiment analysis. The proposed research is focused on three different aspects.
 Firstly, we investigate the use of summarisation techniques for sen-timent classification. Capturing the key passage of a review can be beneficial for both a sentiment classifier, and for a user who could understand the polarity of a review without reading the full text. Secondly, we investigate how to combine knowledge extracted from the reviews or integrated from external sources, with the purpose of producing opinion-oriented summaries. A knowledge-based approach enables to build aspect-based summaries, i.e. sum-maries which are focused on a specific aspect of the item under analysis. Thirdly, we analyse the possibility of generating person-alised (user-oriented or query-biased) opinion-based summaries. Knowledge extraction tools can be used in order to generate clas-sifications and relationships. Given a representation of a docu-ment consisting of the terms, classifications, and relationships ex-tracted from the genuine document, the question is how to gener-ate a summary from the knowledge-based representation. We view term, classification and relationships as propositions . In traditional knowledge-based representations, only classifications and relation-ships are considered. A proposition-context-based representation that combines terms, classifications, and relationships is proposed in [1]. Sentiment adds an extra dimension to this representation. For example, in the sentence  X  X aximus is a brave general X , the term  X  X rave X  is expressing a positive polarity on the class, while in the sentence  X  X eter is a good friend of Mary X  the sentiment is related to the relationship. In a knowledge-oriented approach the sentiment dimension would be inferred to the correct class, leading to the understanding of the sentiment carried by the review. One of the advantages of such a knowledge representation consists in the possibility of augmenting the knowledge through its integration with external knowledge bases. Resources like WordNet 1 , DBpe-dia 2 or other domain-specific ontologies can be exploited for this purpose. In feature-based sentiment analysis, a knowledge-based approach is particularly suitable, as the description of complex do-mains can benefit from the knowledge representation. Complex ob-jects made of different components and attributes can be described in the knowledge base, and linked to opinion terms and phrases. We view knowledge-based summarisation as a key technology, since it enables reasoning over retrieval results. Entity summarisation is a further application of this technology, as the knowledge about a specific entity can be used to create entity profiles.
 A knowledge-based approach to summarisation can be exploited to produce personalised summaries. In the multi-document context, a user can be interested in a specific aspect of topic. For exam-ple, given a set of reviews of a movie, the user might want to read all the comments about a specific actor. This can be also extended for multiple topics. The generation of personalised summaries can be triggered explicitly, i.e. through a specific query, or it can take advantage of a user profile. A user model can be based on ex-plicit keywords selected by the user, or on implicit feedback. A user-oriented study is needed to test the efficacy of a personalised summarisation system.
