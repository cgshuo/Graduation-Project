 Syntactic parsing is always the active research area in natural language processing. In this field, much progress has been made in its theories and several applicable systems have been developed. As a subfield of sy ntactic parsing, dependence parsing recently gains more and more attention among researchers since it provides useful information in many document-analysis related applications. In dependency parsing, dependency treebank is required to train the parser and evaluate its performance. So far, treebanks have been constructed for many languages, including English, French, German, Span-ish, Turkish, Russian, and so on. To facilitate the dependency analysis in Traditional Mongolian, we develop a Traditional Mon golian dependency treebank (TMDT) on syntactic analysis. As one Asian language, Traditional Mongolian is derived from Uyghur and used in Mongolian possesses agglutinative word structure with complex inflection and deriva-tion. Its word is consisted of letters whic h are connected along a straight line, called letter appears in an initial, medial, or fina l position. In some cases, additional graphic variants are selected for visual harmony with the subsequent letter. From the syntactic viewpoint, Traditional Mongolian has SOV constituent order and the predicate is not Mongolian. Case markings on nominal constituents usually indicate their syntactic role. Some cases act as preposition or conjunction. We take the above mentioned characteristics into consideration in building the dependency treebank. 
This paper mainly describes the annotation scheme of the treebank, and simply re-level annotation structure including morphological level and analytical level. Morpho-their importance for Traditional Mongolian word. Analytical level annotates the bi-nary dependency relationship holding between a syntactically subordinate word, information contributes to the analytical annotation. The annotation process is divided into two phases according to the annotated information: morphological annotation phase and analytical annotation phase. In morphological phase, a semi-automation dependency relationships are only annotated manually without any automaton X  X  assis-tance. The whole Treebank is reviewed carefully to ensure its correctness.

The rest of this paper is structured in the following way: Section 2 mentions some related work about dependency treebank development. Section 3 describes the annota-provided to intuitively present the resulting treebank. Finally, section 5 concludes this paper and points out the future direction. treebank and serves as an excellent model for treebank building of Traditional Mon-golian. B.

B X hmov X  et al . in [3] describe a three level annotation scheme in building the Prague dependency treebank, including Morphological level, dependency treebank, and automatically generate the phrase structure tree bank from source Sharing, Minimal Structural Complexity, and Optimal Semantic Information. P. Pajas and J.  X t  X  p X nek in [5] propose an annotation framework that was designed to be extensible and independent of any particular annotation schema. M.-C.d. Marneffe and C.D.

In dependency treebank annotation, the core task is discerning the dependency re-lationships which vary with languages and dependency grammars. I.A. Mel  X  uk in [7] discusses morphological, syntactic and semantic dependencies in Meaning-Text the-the dependency detection criteria. 
Manually and semi-automation annotations are the mainstream of annotation strat-egy. T. Brants et al. in [10] explore (1) the automation of Treebank annotation, (2) the matic annotation. L.v.d.

More information about Traditional Mongolian Lexical and syntactic grammar can be found in the book [15]. logical and analytical information. Yet Prague dependency treebank encodes the de-pendencies at semantic level. In TMDT, we just annotate the sentences at two levels: morphological level and analytical level. Firstly, the morphological captures the basic attributes of the syntactic units (words) and helps to the annotation at analytical level. The analytical level specifies the dependency information of the sentences. Secondly, still some disagreements among researches about the semantic relationship in Tradi-tional Mongolian. Furthermore, the criterion of minimal structural complexity is turn, starting with morphological level in section 3.1 and continuing with the analyti-cal level in section 3.2. 3.1 Morphological Level Morphological information expr esses the attributes of the syntactic units and plays an principles are as follows. 1. Annotation unit 
As mentioned above, many words in Traditional Mongolian are produced through usually expresses a grammatical function or attribute such as tense, mood, number, case, and gender. We treat the derivative as annotation unit and take no considera-tion of the inflection and derivation phenomenon, except the case inflection phe-nomenon. For instance, a dding a tense suffix " ", " " (whose meaning is "go" in 
English) becomes " " (whose meaning is "have gone" in English). " " is lemmas in dictionary, it simplifies the annotation process and treebank representa-tion. 2. Case inflection noun that express the semantic relation of the word to other words in the sentence. 
Some cases are separated with the previous word they attach to by a common blank (Unicode 0X0020). The other cases are sepa rated with the previous word they at-tach to by Mongolian blank (Unicode 0X202F). In Traditional Mongolian grammar, tion. 3. Annotating Part-Of-Speech (POS) tag 
POS are known as word classes or lexical categories and greatly related to the con-stituent role of syntactic unit. So POS is annotated at morphological level. POS tag-ging is the process of classifying words into their POS. The collection of POS tags used in TMDT is listed in Table 1. 4. Annotating word X  X  stem solo stem or a stem with one or more suffi xes. The stem of a word is the part which is common to all its inflected variants. This means that the stem is an essential attribute of Traditional Mongolian word and represents the original meaning of the word. For example, " " is a new word produced by adding " " to " ". 
Here, " " is the stem, and " " is the suffix. Theref ore, we integrate the word X  X  stem into the target dependency treebank. 3.2 Analytical level structure essentially consists of syntactic units (words) linked by binary, asymmetrical analytical level as follows. 1. Annotation unit 
The annotation unit is same as the annotation unit in morphological level. 2. Annotation structure 
The dependency can be represented in the form of an acyclic directed graph which linked by an arc means there is a dependency relationship. No circles are allowed in non-projective. That is to say, cross edges are allowed. 3. Nonverbal word as predicate 
The nonverbal word is treated the same as the verb when it acts as a predicate. 4. Case processing 
In Traditional Mongolian, the case utility is a notable feature. These cases perform in the sentence is called accusative case (a constituent which appears after " " and indicates that " " is an object); the word " " in is called nominative case (a constituent which appears after " " and indicates that " " is a subject). locative case, ablative case, and comitative case. We classify the dependency rela-tionship between the case word and its related constituent according to its syntactic function. 
The emphasis of syntactic annotation is to discern the dependency relationships in-related task. We use heuristic strategies to detect dependency relations and distinguish the head and the dependent in such relations. The strategies are: (1) whether two syn-tactic units formulate a structure C, (2) wh ether the head H determines the category of stricts the position of D.

In TMDT, 21 kinds of analytical dependency are defined according to the annota-tion principles and the syntactic characters of Traditional Mongolian. Table 2 lists all the dependencies together with their descriptions. This section describes the annotation workfl ow, treebank format and final production in TMDT building. 4.1 Annotation workflow Fig. 1 shows the annotation workflow in treebank development. To speed up the an-notation process, we use a CRF tagger proposed in [12] to label POS tags and imple-word. However, purely automatic annotati on without supervision is not reliable. Therefore, we manually correct POS tag and stem resulting from the automation tools manually without any automaton X  X  assistant. In this process, two annotators inde-This ensures the correctness of the target dependency treebank. 4.2 Output format and final production orders of syntactic units in sentences, and the second column represents the syntactic The fifth column represents the dependency between the heads whose sequence is the corresponding number and the dependent which is the word in the corresponding row. TMDT can be extended to multi-dependency treebank. The output format is just add-ing a  X  X el X  column and a  X  X ead X  column in the first format. Table 3 is the first format of the sentence " ". The second format is XML because of its popularity, its ease of understanding and its wide use in format. mistakes. This is convenient for treebank annotation and exploiting the linguistic phe-Coding. for 27%, and clauses account for 73%. There are 4460 distinct words and 1548 distinct stems. The non-projective trees account for 2.25% in the whole treebank.

This paper describes the word X  X  stem and the syntactic dependency relationships. Our work yields promising results, indicating the annotation scheme of TMDT treebank is essential to the success of building a multi-layered treebank. Th is treebank can be extended to a multi-dependency treebank, in which many types of dependency relationship co-exist be-pendency parsing on Traditional Mongolian. Th is is not an end, but rather a road-map to the syntactic analysis on Traditional Mongolian, with some progress along the way, since the theories of linguistics is still in development. 
In the future, we will continue to expand the treebank X  X  scale and attempt to con-vert it into a phrase structure treebank using statistical methods.
