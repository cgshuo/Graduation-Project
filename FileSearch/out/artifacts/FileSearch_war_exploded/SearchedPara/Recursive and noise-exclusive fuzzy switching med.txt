 1. Introduction
Dealing with a large number of images has become a challen-ging task for electronics devices, as these data are highly prone to various types of noises and their formation is inevitably corrupted by noises. These include Gaussian noise, fi xed valued impulse noise (also called as salt and pepper or shot noise or spike noise), random valued impulse noise, speckle noise, etc. In some cases the image is corrupted with multiple types of noises. Gaussian noise affects each pixel, whereas impulse noise affects some randomly selected pixels of the image and keeps the rest noise-free. In the present study, we have considered the noisy image corrupted with the impulse noise of a fi xed value. Impulse noise is generated under unwanted and almost instantaneous (thus impulse-like) situations that normally occur in image sensors, channel transmis-sions, and decoding process. This noise with a low density can change the integrity of the image signi fi cantly. Other types of impulse noise is called random impulse noise that change the values of pixels in a dynamic range. The present study focuses mainly on designing fi lters for impulse noise values of 0 and 255, and provides a brief description and results about its performance for the random impulse noise.

To avoid the damages of noise-free pixels, a corrupted pixel detector based image restoration model can be designed, which prevents the noise-free pixels for fi ltering operation. In this regard, many attempts were described in the literature ( Russo and
Ramponi, 1996; Zhang and Karim, 2002; Luo, 2006; Toh et al., 2008; Zhang and Xiong, 2008; Xiong and Yin, 2012; Duan and
Zhang, 2010 ). However, the present study does not emphasize more on the detection of corrupted pixels, as this operation can be performed using the various existing detection methods, as described in Zhang and Karim (2002) , Xiong and Yin (2012) , Duan and Zhang (2010) , Chang and Chen (2004) , and Kaliraj and
Baskar (2010) . For example, Zhang and Karim (2002) described a impulse noise detection technique based on the minimum abso-lute value of four convolutions obtained using one-dimensional
Laplacian operators, Chang and Chen (2004) described a k -nearest neighbor scheme, Yuksel and Besdok (2004) presented a neuro-fuzzy network, Kaliraj and Baskar (2010) described a neural net-work, and Xiong and Yin (2012) proposed a new fi lter based on nonlocal means for impulse noise detection. We aim here to develop an ef fi cient fi ltering model that plays a signi in the whole restoration process even in the presence of a less ef fi cient detector.

Several fuzzy and non-fuzzy fi lters have been described in the literature for impulse noise reduction ( Russo and Ramponi, 1996;
Luo, 2006; Toprak and Guler, 2007, 2008; Toprak et al., 2008; Toh et al., 2008; Yildirim et al., 2008; Morillas et al., 2009; Kang and Wang, 2009; Wang et al., 2010; Toh and Isa, 2010; Yu et al., 2010;
Chen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013 ). Among them, fuzzy found to be more ef fi cient for their generalization capability and giving weight to pixels based on the degree of belonging to neighbor pixels, with a membership value. The fi lter thus takes the neighborhood information which makes the whole fi ltering process more ef fi cient. With this reasoning, the fuzzy inference rule based fi lter (proposed by Russo and Ramponi (1996) ) per-forms the task well, but cannot properly remove the noise present at the edges. Some approaches, e.g., in Toprak and Guler (2007) ,
Toprak et al. (2008) , Toprak and Guler (2008) and Morillas et al. (2009) , the fuzzy rule based fi lter, were de fi ned. Although these fi lters work well under some constrained environment, they are highly dependent on the effectiveness of the rules. Also, the increase in the number of rules with the complexity and variety poses a dif fi cult task for the designer. In another attempt, Yildirim et al. (2008) described a method that combines the fuzzy set theoretic concept with the neural networks. Comparatively, this combined method provides a good performance, but with the cost of high computational complexity.

Recently, with this line of development, Luo has described a fuzzy switching median fi lter (FSMF) ( Luo, 2006 ) based on the minimum of the absolute luminance difference obtained from the working window, centered at the noisy pixel. Toh et al. (2008) proposed a modi fi ed version of the above fi lter and demonstrated its performance improvement with various test images. In the present paper, we aim to further enhance the performance of this fi lter by modifying it in three different ways. First, the proposed model of image restoration uses a S -type fuzzy membership function (MF) ( Zadeh, 1965 ) to fuzzify the input variable. The advantage of using the S -type MF is that it has a parameter, called fuzzi fi er ( m ), which can be tuned easily according to the require-ment of the problem. This provides more fl exibility for the approximation task of assigning the degree of belonging to a noisy pixel and incorporates the generalization of the fuzzi fi process. This can be achieved by selecting a proper value of m .
The actual parameters that are participating in the design and restoration process are the membership values (with a proper selection of m ) of the noisy pixel to different classes, which in turn shows how much a noisy pixel is compatible to a noisy 3.1. Noisy pixels detection
Detection of noisy pixels is made to avoid the unnecessary fi ltering operation on noise-free pixels for image restoration. As a result, the whole restoration process saves a lot of computation time and there is a signi fi cant reduction of blurring and artifacts in the restored image. As mentioned earlier, we have used a simple noisy pixel detection method based on the histogram of noisy image because our focus of the present study lies in the develop-ment of an ef fi cient fi lter. In general, when the image is con-taminated with equal probabilities of positive and negative impulses (Section 2 ), the histogram of the noisy image produces two peaks at intensities 0 and 255. Therefore, the aim of the detection algorithm is to search for two intensities of positive and negative impulses. For this task, we have used two threshold points, i.e., two local valleys (positive and negative) obtained through a heuristic search in the histogram. Positive and negative valleys are the fi rst valleys obtained by navigating from the right-end and left-end to the center of the histogram, respectively. Thus, pixels  X  values greater than the positive valley and lesser than the negative valley belong to the noisy category, and the rest belong to the noise-free category. A brief pictorial description of this histo-gram based noisy pixels detection, as an example, is given below.
Let Fig. 2 represent the histogram of a noisy BUTTERFLY image (as an example) corrupted with 10% of fi xed valued impulse noise density. As described above, one threshold, i.e., the right-end local minimum ( V higher ) is the fi rst valley came across when navigating from the right-end towards the center of the histogram. Similarly, the other threshold, i.e, the left-end local minimum ( V lower fi rst valley obtained during the navigation from the left-end towards the center of the histogram. Normally, for an 8-bit image corrupted with fi xed valued impulse noise, V higher  X  254 and
V lower  X  1; although they can assume some other intensity values in general.

After the detection of noisy pixels of the image, the fi ltering process operates on them using the proposed fi ltering method of the model, as in the third step of Fig. 1 . The detailed operational description of this step is given in the following section. 3.2. Noise cancelation
The detected noisy pixels are fed as input to the proposed recursive and noise-exclusive fuzzy switching median fi lter (RNE-
FSMF). The fi lter performs four steps of operation. These four steps are performed on all the noisy pixels to get the fi nal restored a proper value of m (see Fig. 3 ). In the present study for one experiment ( Table 2 )wehaveuseddifferentvaluesof m to demonstrate the role of it. It is quite dif fi cult to de value for m , but a value in the interval 2.0  X  3.0 is reasonable. The exact value of m will depend on the problem. In the present paper we have used a value of 2 (as determined experimentally) for the fuzzi fi er m y  X  r ; c  X  f  X  r ; c m  X  r ; c  X f 1 f  X  r ; c g x  X  r ; c where x  X  r ; c is the pixel to be corrected, f  X  r ; c is the fuzzy membership value of x  X  r ; c ,and m  X  r ; c is the median of the noise-free pixels of the {3 3} working window.

In the testing phase of the neighbor pixels as noisy or noise-free (i.e., while calculating the median), we also consider the noise-free pixels, which are corrected previously. In other words, the correcting action for the next pixels would use the values of the previously corrected pixels in its calculation, and thus the whole operation becomes recursive. 4. Results and discussion
For establishing the usefulness of the proposed fi lter for the image restoration model, we consider various noisy images corr-upted by both positive and negative impulse noises with equal probability. Ten benchmark test images ( Fig. 4 ) of sizes 256 256 namely, BUTTERFLY, BRIDGE, LAKE, SCENERY, HOUSE, LENA, OWL,
MAN, BOAT and BABOON, and fi ve real-time test images (collected in real-time) of sizes 256 256 namely, EAGLE, ZEBRA, BIRD-
HERON, BIRD-PELICON and DRAGONFLY, are used for the present study. However, the experimental results are provided only for the
BUTTERFLY and BIRD-HERON images because a similar trend of comparative performance is observed for the remaining images.
The proposed fi ltering method is compared with others, such as switching median fi lter (SMF) ( Zhang and Karim, 2002 ), fuzzy switching median fi lter ( Luo, 2006 ) with minimum of the absolute luminance differences, and fuzzy switching median fi lter ( Toh et al., 2008 ) with maximum of the absolute luminance differences.
The relative performance of the fi lters with others is made with subjective visual criteria and quantitative measures, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and computational time ( T c visual image quality includes noise suppression, edge preserva-tion, signal distortion and detail preservation. The computational time is the time taken by the different operations of the the restoration models. The main concept of PSNR is to make a comparison of the difference between the original and resulted images and determine the quality of the restored image. PSNR can densities. This clearly indicates the ef fi ciency of the compared to F1 and F2.

In a comparative analysis, it is observed from Table 1 that for all percentages impulse noise densities, restoration performance measured with PSNR values is more encouraging for the model using the fi lter F5 (recursive version of the fi lter F4) compared to the model using fi lter F4 (non-recursive). For example, with 10% of noise density the model with fi lter F5 provided PSNR 34.7178, whereas with other fi lters including the fi lter F4, the values are less. The analysis justi fi es the superiority of the model with recursive fi lter to the model with non-recursive fi lters.
In another comparison of performance, the superiority of the model (F6) with noise-exclusive fi lter to the model with noise-inclusive fi lter (F5) is also realized from Table 1 . Table 1 revealed that for all impulse noise densities the proposed model that incorporates the recursive and noise-exclusive operations pro-vided higher PSNR values compared to others. For example, the
PSNR value of the model with fi lter F6 is 36.7441, which is encouraging compared to the models with fi lters F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5.
 the results for this image are only reported in the article.
As mentioned in Section 3 , we have used m  X  2 for all other experiments for uniformity.
 depicted in Table 2 , because a similar trend of performances is observed for the rest of the noise densities. All the simulations are done in a MATLAB (Matrix Laboratory) environment in an Intel
Pentium core i3 processor with 2.93 GHz processor speed. It is seen for all the cases that the T c values for the model with (with recursive and S -type membership function based fuzzy switching median fi lter (FSMF) with maximum of absolute lumi-nance difference) are higher compared to the models with fi F4, F3, F2 and F1 at the cost of improved performance.
As expected, the proposed model with fi lter F6 takes less compu-tational time than others except the model with fi lter F1, and at the same time performs the best. This justi fi es that the incorpora-tion of the non-exclusive operation in the fi ltering process reduces the computation time.

In addition to the above quantitative comparison of perfor-mance, the qualitative performance comparison at 40% and 80% of noise densities has been made with models using different for all the images. We have shown the results with two images (BUTTERFLY and BIRD-HERON) obtained using all the models, because a similar trend of observation was observed for the rest of the images. Although the measurements are made for all percentages of noise levels and different images, we have shown the results with the BUTTERFLY image for 40% ( Fig. 5 ) and 80% ( Fig. 7 ) of noise densities, and the BIRD-HERON image for 40% ( Fig. 8 ) of noise density only because the claim for improvement with the proposed model is similar for all noise densities and images.

It is observed that the proposed model with fi lter F6 at 40% noise density restored the image ( Fig. 5 (h)) effectively preserving better edge and fi ne details compared to images ( Fig. 5 (c) restored by the other models mentioned above. The proposed model using fi lter F6 decreases the possible degradation rate of the corrected pixels and biased estimation due to the exclusion of noisy pixels in fi ltering. Also, the recursive fi lter incorporates the already corrected pixels which enhances the fi ltering performance, and the S -type membership function generalizes the operation with proper approximation of the fi ltering process. The effects of function, such as better generalization and approximation cap-ability in one hand; and improved noise reduction ability of using the recursive and noise-exclusive operations on the other hand. With extensive experimental results on various images with different noise levels, it is observed that quantitatively References
