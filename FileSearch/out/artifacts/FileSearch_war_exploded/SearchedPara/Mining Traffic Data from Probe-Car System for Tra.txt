 We are developing a technique to predict travel time of a vehicle for an objective road section, based on real time traffic data collected through a probe-car system. In the area of Intelligent Transport System (ITS), travel time prediction is an important subject. Probe-car system is an upcoming data collection method, in which a number of vehicles are used as moving sensors to detect actual traffic situation. It can collect data concerning much larger area, compared with traditional fixed detectors. Our prediction technique is based on statistical analysis using AR model with seasonal adjustment and MDL (Minimum Description Length) criterion. Seasonal adjustment is used to handle periodicities of 24 hours in traffic data. Alternatively, we employ state space model, which can handle time series with periodicities. It is important to select really effective data for prediction, among the data from widespread area, which are collected via probe-car system. We do this using MDL cr iterion. That is, we find the explanatory variables that really have influence on the future travel time. In this paper, we experimentally show effectiveness of our method using probe-car data collected in Nagoya Metropolitan Area in 2002. I.2.6 [ Artificial Intelligence ]: Learning Algorithms, Experimentation ITS, travel time, probe-car, time series, information criterion We are developing a technique of travel time prediction using real time traffic data such as probe-car data. Our goal is to establish a method to predict travel time of a vehicle for an objective road section (referred to as `link'), re flecting real time traffic conditions. Travel time prediction is an important subject in the area of Intelligent Transport System (ITS), e.g. for the purpose of dynamic route guidance In usual route guidance system as of car special cases, and in particular, can treat nonstationary nature of time series such as periodicity. One of purposes of our study is to utilize the information about not only the objective link but wide spread links which is available via probe-car system. To do this, we employ the multi-dimensional statistical models. We refer to the variables corresponding to the added links as explanatory variables. In this task, it is important to select really effective explanatory variables, since using ineffective variables affects prediction accuracy in general. We solve this problem in the context of model selection in statistics and learning theory. In fact we employ information criterion MDL (Minimum Descrip tion Length) [6]. It is known that learning based on this criterion can improve accuracy of prediction. We will show by cross validation using probe-car data that prediction accuracy is improved by adding exploratory variables. Selection of explorator y variables can be thought of as knowledge acquisition. For example, if the section in front of the objective link is not selected, but that after the objective section is, then we learn that the latter has re lation to the travel time. This is very simple case, but we might discover the relation which we cannot aware by usual observation. In this paper, we report certain experiments using probe-car data collected in Nagoya Metropolitan Area in 2002. There, approximately 1,500 probe-taxis we re operated [4]. We evaluated accuracy of our methods by cross validation. In particular, we showed that employing the AR mode improved accuracy compared to prediction by the tr avel time table even in the case without explanatory variables a nd that selecting explanatory variables by MDL was effective. The data from the probe-car system contains rather many outliers, since the individual probe-cars drive at the driver's pleasure. Hence, we cleaned up the probe data before creating the time series of averaged travel time from the probe data. For this procedure, we employed an outlier detection engine SmartSifter.[10] We briefly review the related researches. Concerning the static methods, Kumagai et al. [5] and Chung [3] studied. In the former, they make clusters of daily patterns by principal component analysis and create a function which maps each day to a cluster by quantification theory III. This is smarter than the way of simple travel time table. In the latter, he employed clustering technique from data mining field. It is po ssible to employ these techniques in our work instead of simple travel time table. As a method by time series analysis, [7] is known. They employ artificial neural network as a prediction function. The rest of this paper is organi zed as follows: Section 2 describes the probe-car data we use. Sec tion 3 illustrates statistical model we employ in this work. We review AR model and theory of information criterion. In Section 4, we state our experimental result. Section 5 contains our concluding remarks. We use the data collected in probe-car experiment which has been conducted in Nagoya Metropolitan Area by ``Internet ITS Project (Main body: Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry since 2002). There, approximately 1,500 probe-taxis have been operated [4] shows the objective li nks in this paper. The reason why we selected these links is that many probe data are available for them. In other related works, the objective links are usually Basically, we use AR model for tim e series modeling. It assumes that the data sequence is stati onary, but this assumption is not valid for traffic information, wh ich has periodic patterns with 24 hours and 7 days. Hence, we need to apply seasonal adjustment. In this paper, we do it for 24hours periodicity, using travel time table, which is basically in the similar format data as the probe time series but made ignoring the information of date. For each link, we can obtain the records where i is the time index. Note that the travel time table itself can be used for prediction. In Subsection 4.1, we examine accuracy of this prediction method. Removing the values in the travel time table from each term in the probe time series, we have new time series. Now let  X  t be a vector of which components are T ( i ) and N ( i ) of all elements of S , where contained in w t . We define a new time series as x t = w t - X  t . The averages of T, W, and N through x n are 0. Also, it is expected to be stationary, approximately. The above travel time table can be modified as changing the time interval where mean is taken. For example, it can be 1 hour instead of 15 minutes. Then, we have a smoother cyclic pattern. Also, it is possible to replace each value with the average of the neighbor's value. Figure 2 shows graphs of travel time tables which we made from our probe time series. They are average for weekdays. The AR model is defined as follows: where  X  t is a noise term and we assume that this is drawn from Gaussian distributions with covariance V and mean 0. Here, A ( j ) is d th order square matrix and refe rred to as AR coefficient. We parameter k is referred to as orde r of the AR model. An AR model specifies the probability distribution of the data sequence Suppose that the objective mean travel time for prediction is w t :1 the first component of vector w. This is referred to as an objective variable. Here, the remaining component w t:2 ,..., w t:20 are explanatory variables, if we em ploy the AR model (1) as it is. However, this is wasteful. We should select the explanatory variables which are truly effective for prediction. Let M be a symbol to represent a way of such selection and G a set consisting of all M . Let z be a vector consisting of the objective variable and the explanatory variables specified by M with z t:1 = x t:1 . We let d' denote the dimension of z . When we specify M and the order k of AR model, an AR model with parameters is specified. We let  X 
M,k be a parameter's range associated with the AR model specified by M and k . Let ) , , , | ( probability density function specified by M, k, and Here, our task is to select appropriate M and k, given the data x n . We do this using MDL (Minimum Description Length) [7][1], which is defined as where we let 2  X   X  denote the (1,1)-component of V  X  and  X  ' parameters needed to specify the conditional probability of A ( j ) ( j =1,..., k ), and the (1,1) component of V . Hence, we have description length and the second term as parameter description length. The former is measure for the model's fitting to the data, while the latter is measure for comp lexity of the model. The data description length equals minus likelihood, which is what is maximized for maximum likelihood estimation. In general, the more complex the model comes, the shorter the data description length comes. Hence, it is no good to use likelihood as index for comparing models, whose complexity are different from each other. However, we can regulari ze the index by adding parameter description length as penalty for complex model. In fact, according to the MDL principle, we should select M and k which minimize MDL( z n ,M,k ). We refer to them as MDL estimate. It is known that the accuracy of prediction is optimized in terms of Hellinger distance, when we em ploy the MDL estimate under a certain regularization condition [1][9]. Here, we summarize our methods by the charts illustrated in Figure 3 (learning phase) and Figure 4 (prediction phase) . These charts are for the method of AR m odel with travel time table. As for the state space model, the flow charts becomes much more simpler, we have only to replace the block indicated by broken line by the state space model. By this procedure, we can guess accuracy of our technique for newly observed data. We employ the mean squared error (MSE for short). Assume that we have x n as the test data. For them, we calculate the error as () ) /(  X  mean squared error obtained in the i th stage. The final averaged (RMSE for short). First, we examine the case where we use only one link for an explanatory variable. Table 3 show s the results for objective links l03, l04, l05, and l06. The second column indicates the explanatory variable we used. In this column, `-1' (`+1') means that the travel time of downstream (upstream) link of the objective link was added as a explanatory va riable and `-2' (`+2') means its downstream (upstream) link's travel time was added. Note that the values of MDL listed here were obtained with the whole data set D , while MSE and RMSE were obtained with the subset Di corresponding to each objective link. We indicate the minimum values of MDL and MSE of each link by gray cells. From these results, we can see that accuracy was improved compared to the case without an explanatory variable when we selected the model which minimizes MDL. Next, we examine the case wher e we use multiple links for explanatory variables. We evaluated the MDL of all combinations of neighbor link's travel time as exploratory variables. We list the combination which minimized MDL for objective links l03, l04, l05, and l06 in table 5 with MSE. Here, `y' means that we used the link as an explanatory variable. Also, we list the combination which minimized MSE for the same objective links in Table 5. From these results, we conclude that model selection by MDL can choose the nearly best combination of the neighbor links to predict travel time except for the objective link l06. As for l06, we could not observe significant correlati on between MDL and MSE. We think that this is because l06 link is close to a large crossing and the influence of the signal on the crossing was large. Besides RMSE, we examine accuracy of our method by relative error too, which we defined by absolute prediction error divided by observed mean travel time. Concerning the listed combination of explanatory variables, the averaged relative errors were 27.7%, 28.7%, 36.5%, and 38.3%, respectively for l03, l04, l05, and l06. 
Table 5: Combination of explanatory vars. minimizing MSE We compared the method of AR m odel with time table to that of state space model. For this evaluation, we prepared the probe time series where one record is the value for 60 minutes. This is because the computational cost of the Kalman filter is of order O ( L ), where L is the assumed period lengt h. For probe time series in our experiment, the proper value of L is 24 when one record is Concerning the prediction of futu re travel time using real time traffic data from probe-car system, we have examined accuracy of the two methods: AR model with travel time table and state space model. As for the latter method, it was significantly inferior to the former method in our experiment. It is probably because of instablity of the data from probe-car system. We think that further investigation will be instructive. As for the former method, we have shown that our method is mo re effective than the time table method alone and that the prediction accuracy is improved by using explanatory variables selected by MDL principle.
