 Nature inspired algorithms are problem solving techniques that attempt to sim-ulate the occurrence of natural processes. Some of the natural processes that such algorithms are based on include the evolution of species [1,2], organization of insect colonies [3,4] and the working of immune systems [5,6]. Ant Colony Op-timization (ACO) algorithm [3,4] belongs to the natural class of problem solving techniques which is initially inspired by the efficiency of real ants as they find their fastest path back to their nest when sourcing for food. An ant is able to find this path back due to the presence of pheromone deposited along the trail by either itself or other ants. An open loop feedback exists in this process as the chances of an ant taking a path increases with the amount of pheromone built up by other ants. This natural phenomenon has been applied to model the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) [3,4].

Early approaches in applying ACO to clustering [7,8,9] are to first partition the search area into grids. A population of ant-like agents then move around this 2D grid and carry or drop objects based on certain probabilities so as to categorize the objects. However, this may result in too many clusters as there might be objects left alone in the 2D grid and objects still carried by the ants when the algorithm stops. Therefore, Some other algorithms such as K-means are normally combined with ACO to minimize categorization errors [10,11,12]. More recently, variants of ant-based clustering have been proposed, such as using inhomogeneous population of ants which allow to skip several grid cells in one step [13], representing ants as data objects and allowing them to enter either the active state or the sleeping state on a 2D grid [14].

Existing approaches are all based on the same scenario that ants move around in a 2D grid and carry or drop objects to perform categorization. This paper proposes a novel ant-based clustering approach without relying on a 2D grid structure. In addition, it can also generate optimal number of clusters without incorporating any other algorithms such as K-means or AHC. When compared with both the classical document clustering algorithms such as K-means and AHC and the Artificial Immune Network (aiNet) based method [15], it shows improved performance when tested on the subsets of 20 Newsgroup data [16]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. The proposed ant-based clustering ap-proach is discussed in Section 3. Experimental results are presented in Section 4. Finally, section 5 concludes the paper and outlines the possible future work. The first Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm has been applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) [3,4]. Given a set of cities and the distances between them, the TSP is the problem of finding the shortest possible path which visits every city exactly once. More formally, it can be represented by a complete weighted graph G =( N, E )where N is the set of nodes representing the cities and E is the set of edges. Each edge is assigned a value d ij which is the distance between cities i and j . When applying the ACO algorithm to the a numerical value which is modified during the execution of the algorithm and t is the iteration counter.

The skeleton of the ACO algorithm applied to the TSP is:
At first, each of the m ants is placed on a randomly chosen city. At each Tour construction step, ant k currently at city i , chooses to move to city j at the t th iteration based on the probability P k ij ( t ) which is biased by the pheromone trail strength  X  ij ( t ) on the edge between city i and city j and a locally available heuristic information  X  ij . Each ant is associated with a tabu list in which the current partial tour is stored, i.e. tabu k ( s ) stores a set of cities visited by ant k so far at time s . After all the ants have constructed their tours, Pheromone update is performed by allowing each ant to add pheromone on the edges it has visited. At the end of the iteration, the tabu list is emptied and each ant can choose an alternative path for the next cycle. In document clustering, the vector-space model is usually used to represent doc-uments and documents are categorized into groups based on the similarity mea-sure among them. For each document d i in a collection D ,let W be the unique word items occurring in D and M = |W| , then document d i is represented by the vector d i =( w i 1 ,w i 2 ,  X  X  X  ,w iM )where w ij denotes the appearance of word w j in document d i which is normally weighted by term frequency X inverse document frequency (TFIDF).

Fig. 1 shows the ant-based document clustering algorithm. The design of the ant-based algorithm involves the specification of the following:  X   X  ij ( t ) represents the amount of pheromone associated with the document  X   X  ij is a problem-dependent heuristic function for the document pair doc ij .  X  Ant k moves from document i to document j at t th iteration by following  X  Finally, a stopping criteria needs to be carefully set. It can either be a prede-
Once the ant-based clustering algorithm has run successfully, a fully connected network of nodes will be formed. Each node represents a document, and every edge is associated with a certain level of pheromone intensity. The next step is essentially to break the linkages in order to generate clusters. Various methods can be applied such as minimum spanning trees. Here, the average pheromone strategy is used. The average pheromone of all the edges is first computed and then edges with pheromone intensity less than the average pheromone will be removed from the network and results in a partially connected graph. Nodes will then be separated by their connecting edges to form clusters. In this section, the performance of the proposed ant-based clustering algorithm is evaluated. The experimental setup is first explained followed by a compara-tive account of the results generated from different experiments conducted. This section also attempts to obtain the optimal parameters of ant-based clustering and reason intuitively its performance on clustering in comparison with other algorithms. 4.1 Experimental Setup Experiments have been conducted on the 20 Newsgroup data set [16] which is in fact a benchmarking data set commonly used for experiments in text ap-plications of machine learning techniques. A few combinations of subsets of documents are selected for experiments based on various degrees of difficulty. Table 1 lists the details of various subsets used. Each subset consists of 150 ran-domly chosen documents from various newsgroups. All newsgroup articles have their headers stripped and main body pre-processed only. Once transformed into term-document vectors, they are fed into the clustering engine.

The tunable parameters in the ant-based clustering algorithm include number of iterations i ,numberofants m , rate of decay  X  , swarm similarity coefficient  X  , and the parameters  X  and  X  that control the bias on the pheromone trail. A set of experiments have been conducted and it was found that the optimal value or range of each parameter is i = 100, 14  X  m  X  19, 0 . 1  X   X   X  0 . 3, 0 . 4  X   X   X  0 . 5,  X  =1,and  X  = 1. From this section onwards, subsequent experiments will be carried out using these selected optimized values for the parameters. 4.2 Clustering Accuracy This section evaluates the performance on clustering accuracy based on F-measure [17]. The 10-fold cross-validation technique is applied to each of the four sample data sets and the average F-measure score will be used as a com-parative observation. The experimental results given in Table 2 shows that the ant-based clustering method performs much better than AHC and K-means in all four sample data sets. In AHC and K-means, information on the expected number of clusters must be supplied, but ACO is able to predict the cluster structure accurately by generating the exact number of clusters in each sample data set.

Table 2 also compares the published results from aiNet [15], a technique based on Artificial Immune System (AIS), with ant-based clustering using the iden-tical sets of data. Belonging to the same class of nature inspired algorithms as ACO,AISperformsanevolutionaryprocessonrawdocumentdatabasedonthe immune network and affinity maturation principles. The proposed method uses Agglomerate Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) and K-means to construct antibod-ies and detect clusters. Also, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is introduced for dimensionality reduction in a bid to improve clustering accuracy. From the published experimental results, none of the proposed AIS methods scored is close to the results of ant-based clustering in all four sample data sets. In fact, the re-sults from the ant-based clustering algorithm have shows a relative improvement in performance over the aiNet pca K-means by 5% to 34% and a relative improve-ment over the aiNet pca AHC by 7% to 35%. Furthermore, it is observed that the ant-based approach is far more stable by pr oducing consistent F-measure scores of higher than 0.8, while the aiNet scored varying F-measure results, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8.

Although both ACO and AIS belong to the same family of nature inspired al-gorithms, these two methods use entirely different approaches to model problem solving techniques. This results in a performance difference when applying both to the same problem domain. The evolution stage in ACO makes use of stochastic ants as decision tools for choosing a path to move based on pheromone trail in-tensity. The final network generated has edges of varying amounts of pheromone that represent the differences among documents in a collection. Such differences will allow easy partitioning of semantically similar documents by using the aver-aged pheromone level as a threshold for searching connected sub-graphs in the network. This entire evolving process models after the document clustering task almost perfectly.

On the other hand, using the AIS to model the same clustering task may not be an ideal case. The clonal selection theory is only capable of generating an immune network based on affinity between antibodies and antigens (documents). Detection of clusters in this network requires assistance from other methods such as AHC or K-means, which may disrupt the biological ordering of antigens. Therefore, the performance of AIS is limited by the artificial clustering applied on its network. This paper has proposed a novel ant-based clustering algorithm and its applica-tion to the unsupervised data clustering problem. Experimental results showed that the ant-based clustering method performs better than K-means and AHC by a wide margin. Moreover, the ant-based clustering method has achieved a higher degree of clustering accuracy than the Artificial Immune Network (aiNet) algorithm which also belongs to the same family of nature inspired algorithms.
In future work, it would be interesting to investigate the behavior of the ant-based algorithm using other sources of heuristic functions and pheromone update strategies. In addition, more intelligent methods of breaking linkages among documents can be devised to replace the existing average pheromone approach.
