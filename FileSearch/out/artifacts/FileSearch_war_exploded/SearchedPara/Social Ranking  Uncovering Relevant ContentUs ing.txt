 Social (or folksonomic) tagging has become a very popu-lar w ay to d escribe, categorise, search, d iscover and navi-gate content w ithin W eb 2 .0 w ebsites. U nlike tax onomies, w hich overimpose a hierarchical categorisation of content, folksonomies empow er end users by enabling them to freely create and choose the categories (in this case, tags) that best d escribe some content. H ow ever, as tags are informally d e-ned , continually changing, and ungoverned , social tagging has often been criticised for low ering, rather than increasing, the e ciency of searching, d ue to the number of synonyms, homonyms, polysemy, as w ell as the heterogeneity of users and the noise they introd uce. In this paper, w e propose So-cia l R a n kin g , a method that ex ploits recommend er system techniq ues to increase the e ciency of searches w ithin W eb 2 .0 . W e measure users' similarity based on their past tag activity. W e infer tags' relationships based on their associa-tion to content. W e then propose a mechanism to answ er a user's q uery that ranks (recommend s) content based on the inferred semantic d istance of the q uery to the tags associated to such content, w eighted by the similarity of the q uerying user to the users w ho created those tags. A thorough evalua-tion cond ucted on the C iteU L ike d ataset d emonstrates that Social R anking neatly improves coverage, w hile not compro-mising on accuracy.

T he ad vent of W eb 2 .0 has transformed users from passive consumers to active prod ucers of content. T his has tremen-d ously increased the amount of information that is available to users (from vid eos on sites like Y ouT ube and M ySpace, to pictures on F lickr, to music on L ast.fm, and so on). T his content is no longer categorised accord ing to pre-d e ned tax -onomies. R ather, a new trend called socia l (or folkson om ic ) ta ggin g has emerged and q uickly become the most popular w ay to d escribe, categorise, search, d iscover and navigate content w ithin W eb 2 .0 w ebsites.

U nlike tax onomies, w hich overimpose a hierarchical cat-egorisation of content, folksonomies empow er end users by enabling them to person a lly and freely create and choose the categories (in this case, tags) that best d escribe a piece of information (a picture, a blog entry, a vid eo clip, etc.). T ag cloud s are then w id ely used to visualise a set of related tags that best d escribe either ind ivid ual items or the content of a w ebsite as a w hole, w ith the most freq uently used tags be-ing given more importance either in font siz e or color. O ther visualisation techniq ues have been stud ied , in ord er to give more importance to tags' relationships rather than popular-ity [4 , 1 1 ]. W hen users w ant to nd content, they navigate, via hyperlinks, from a tag to a collection of items that are associated w ith that tag.

H ow ever, as tags are informally d e ned , continually chang-ing, and ungoverned , social tagging has often been criticiz ed for low ering, rather than increasing, the e ciency of search-ing [2 ]. T his is d ue to the number of synonyms, homonyms, polysemy, as w ell as the heterogeneity of users, contex ts, and the noise that they introd uce.

In ord er to `connect' users w ith content that they d eem relevant w ith respect to their interests, e cient searching techniq ues have to be d eveloped for this novel and uniq ue d omain. B y e cient, w e mean that the searching techniq ue should be both a ccu ra te (i.e., the returned content d oes sat-isfy users' interests), and com p lete (i.e., if there is relevant content in the system, this should be found ).

In this paper, w e propose a techniq ue called Socia l R a n k-in g that aims to e ciently nd , w ithin a potentially huge d ataset, content that is relevant to a user's q uery. In typical W eb 2 .0 fashion, w e assume such content to have been d e-scribed w ith an arbitrary number of tags and by an arbitrary number of users. Social R anking answ ers a user's q uery by ex ploiting trad itional recommend er system techniq ues (Sec-tion 2 ): it measures users' similarity based on their past tag activity; it infers tags' relationships based on their associa-tion to content; nally, it ranks (recommend ) content based on the inferred distance of the query to the tags associated to such content, w eighted b y the sim ilarity of the querying user to the users w ho created those tags. W e p resent the results of an ex tensiv e ex p erim ental study w e hav e conducted on the C iteU L ik e dataset (http :/ / w w w .citeulik e.org/ ), dem on-strating how S ocial R ank ing neatly im p rov es cov erage, w ith-out com p rom ising on accuracy (S ection 3 ). W e p osition our-selv es w ith resp ect to other w ork s in the area in S ection 4 , b efore p resenting our conclusions and future directions of research (S ection 5 ).
In order to understand the k ey characteristics of the target scenario, and thus dev elop a query m odel that is grounded on its p eculiarities, w e hav e analysed C iteU L ik e, a typ ical W eb 2 .0 w eb site. C iteU L ik e is a social b ook m ark ing w eb -site that aim s to p rom ote and dev elop the sharing of scien-ti c references am ongst researchers. S im ilarly to the cata-loging of w eb p ages w ithin del.icio.us, and of p hotograp hs w ithin F lick r, C iteU L ik e enab les scientists to organiz e their lib raries w ith freely chosen tags w hich p roduce a folk son-om y of academ ic interests. C iteU L ik e runs a daily p rocess w hich p roduces a snap shot sum m ary of w hat articles hav e b een p osted b y w hom and w ith w hat tags. W e dow nloaded one such archiv e in D ecem b er 2 0 0 7 . T he archiv e contained roughly 2 8 ,0 0 0 users, w ho had tagged 8 2 0 ,0 0 0 p ap ers ov er-all, using 2 4 0 ,0 0 0 distinct tags. A p re-analysis of the archiv e rev ealed the p resence of a v ast am ount of p ap ers and a v ast am ount of tags b ook m ark ed/ used b y one user only . In or-der to m ak e the dataset m ore m anageab le, w e p runed it so to rem ov e those p ap ers and tags that had b een b ook -m ark ed/ used only once ov er the entire dataset. W e w ere thus left w ith roughly 1 0 0 ,0 0 0 p ap ers, 5 5 ,0 0 0 distinct tags, and 2 8 ,0 0 0 users.

W e then analysed this dataset m ore carefully in term s of users' activ ity, p ap ers' p op ularity, and tags' usage. D e-tailed results are rep orted in a p relim inary v ersion of this p ap er [2 7 ]. W ith resp ect to the p rob lem of nding and recom m ending content in W eb 2 .0 w eb sites, the follow ing insights can b e draw n: Long Tail of Tags: a p ow er law distrib ution curv e em erges Long Tail of P ap e rs: a rather steep p ow er law distrib u-
A content search/ recom m ender technique for W eb 2 .0 w eb -sites should thus b e dev elop ed, tak ing into account these intrinsic characteristics of the target scenario.

B ased on these ob serv ations, w e hav e dev elop ed a content search and recom m endation technique called S ocia l R a nking .
L et us consider a user u w ho is interested in retriev ing som e content of interest (in our sp eci c case, p ap ers). U ser u could ex p licitly sub m it a query q u consisting of query tags t ; t 2 ; : : : ; t n ; alternativ ely, in a m ore typ ical recom m ender system fashion, the system could im p licitly run a query, us-ing the set of tags t 1 ; t 2 ; : : : ; t n associated b y the user to his latest b ook m ark ed p ap er, or the set of his m ost frequently used tags ov erall, etc. In b oth cases, the system answ er-ing the query w ould norm ally rank results according to the follow ing tw o criteria: the higher the num b er of query tags associated to the resource, the higher its rank ing; and, the higher the num b er of users u i w ho tagged the resource using (som e of the) query tags, the higher its rank ing. Intuitiv ely sp eak ing, the rst criterion caters for accuracy of the result, the second caters for con dence in it. T he form ula is: that is, the rank ing of p ap er p is com p uted as the num b er of tags t x that users u i w ho b ook m ark ed p used and that b elonged to the query set q u .

A s w e shall dem onstrate ex p erim entally in S ection 3 , w hile this sim p le technique w ork s w ell to nd p op ular content de-scrib ed w ith p op ular tags, it fails to address queries that look for the v ery long tail of m edium -to-low p op ularity con-tent, as a large am ount of low -score results are returned. A ccuracy is not the only p rob lem : if the user running the query also uses tags that b elong to the long tail of tags, chances are that relev ant content is not found at all, and cov erage then b ecom es the m ost p ressing issue.
To address these problems, we propose Social Ranking, a techniq u e inspired by traditional C ollaborativ e F iltering mechanisms [2 2 ]: rst, we identify the u sers with similar interests to the q u ery ing u ser u ; according to ou r analy -sis, su ch commu nity shou ld be easily identi ed by stu dy ing u sers' tag activ ity . C ontent tagged by these u sers shou ld be scored higher in a way that is proportional to the q u anti ed similarity . Second, ev en thou gh tags can be broadly clu s-tered in domains of knowledge, people tend to u se slightly di erent su bsets of them within each domain. W e thu s iden-tify the tags that are similar (or, rather, related) to the q u ery tags, thu s ex panding the q u ery to this enlarged set. W e be-liev e, and ou r ev alu ation will con rm, that users' similarity imp ro ves accuracy of the resu lts, while tags' similarity (i.e., query expan sio n ) imp ro ves co verage .

In the remainder of this section, we illu strate how we com-pu te u sers' similarity (Section 2 .2 .1 ), how we compu te tags' similarity (Section 2 .2 .2 ), and how we combine these two techniq u es together (Section 2 .2 .3 ).
Social tagging ty pically prov ides a 3 -dimensional relation-ship between u sers, resou rces and tags (u sers bookmark re-sou rces with a certain nu mber of tags). D i erent de nitions of u sers' similarity can be deriv ed; here we consider a simple y et e ectiv e one: the more tags two u sers hav e u sed in com-mon, the more similar they are, regardless of what resou rces they u sed it on. This de nition projects ou r 3 -dimensional space onto a 2 -dimensional one, throwing away information abou t `resou rces', and keeping only information abou t what tags a u ser has u sed and how often (F igu re 1 , top). W hile one may argu e that, in so doing, we discard important infor-mation, we believ e that, in scenarios where tags are clu stered arou nd topics, the information lost is not signi cant.
W e thu s describe each u ser u i with a v ector v v [ j ] cou nts the nu mber of times that u sers u i u sed tag t G iv en two u sers u i and u j , we then q u antify u sers' similarity s im ( u i ; u j ) as the cosine of the angle between their v ectors: V ariou s similarity measu res can be u sed other than the cosine-based similarity [5 ]. F or ex ample, concordance-based sim-ilarity [1 ] cou ld be u sed, so that the more tags two u sers share, the more similar they are (regardless of how many times they hav e u sed them). H owev er, we believ e tag fre-q u ency to be an important piece of information to determine a u ser's interests. A lternativ ely , P earson C orrelation (and its v ariations -e.g., weighted P earson [1 9 , 5 ]) cou ld be u sed; as shown in [1 4 ], di erent similarity measu res perform dif-ferently , both in terms of accu racy and cov erage; we chose cosine-based similarity for its constantly good performance, althou gh we plan to stu dy the impact of other similarity measu res in the fu tu re.
W e de ne tags' similarity as follows: the more resou rces hav e been tagged with the same pair of tags, the more sim-ilar (related) these tags are, regardless of the u sers who u sed them. This de nition projects ou r 3 -dimensional space onto a 2 -dimensional one, as shown in F igu re 1 , bottom part. Similarly to what we said before, in scenarios where u sers' interests are a rather small and consistent su bset of the broader range of topics in the whole website, we believ e that the information thrown away du ring the projection is not signi cant.

W e thu s describe each tag t i with a v ector w i where w cou nts the nu mber of times that tag t i was associated to paper p j . G iv en two tags t i and t j , we then q u antify tags' similarity s im ( t i ; t j ) as the cosine of the angle between their v ectors:
The q u ery model we propose ex ploits the two similarity measu res discu ssed abov e (on u sers and on tags) in the fol-lowing way . W hen u ser u su bmits a q u ery q u = f t 1 to discov er content that can be described by q u ery tags t ; t 2 ; : : : ; t n , two steps take place: 1 . Q uery E x p ansion : the set of q u ery tags q u is ex -2 . R ank ing : all resou rces that hav e been tagged with The ranking of a paper p wou ld then be compu ted as: R ( p ) = X where, for each user u i who tag g ed p , P s im ( t x ; t es how relev an t the tag s t x associated b y u i to p are with resp ect to the tag s t j b elon g in g to the ex p an d ed q uery set q ; n ote that, in the b asic case of form ula 1 , this sim p ly m ean t coun tin g how m an y tag s from q u user u i to p . M oreov er, the relev an ce is then m ag n i ed (i.e., p a-p ers are p ushed hig her up in the ran k in g ) in a way that is p rop ortion al to user's sim ilarity s im ( u; u i ).
A ssum in g that users' sim ilarity s im ( u i ; u j ) an d tag s' sim -ilarity s im ( t i ; t j ) are com p uted o in e (i.e., d aily , week ly , etc.), then the com p lex ity of an swerin g a q uery con tain in g T tag s is O ( k T P N ), where P is the n um b er of p ap ers in the sy stem an d N is the n um b er of users. H owev er, this is a g ross ov erestim ation : as our d ataset p re-an aly sis has shown , each tag is used on av erag e on at m ost 4 0 p ap ers (with 4 0 &lt; &lt; P ), an d each p ap er has b een tag g ed on av er-ag e b y less than 5 users (with 5 &lt; &lt; N ), so that the tim e to an swer a q uery is sim p ly p rop ortion al to the n um b er of tag s in the ex p an d ed q uery set (i.e., k T ).

W e call this ap p roach S ocial R an k in g , as it ex p loits in -form ation com in g from the em erg en t social n etwork of users an d social n etwork of tag s to ran k con ten t in a way that is m ean in g ful to the q uery in g user. In the n ex t section , we p resen t the results ob tain ed when ev aluatin g this ap p roach. W e hav e thoroug hly an aly sed the p erform an ce of S ocial R an k in g on the C iteU L ik e d ataset, b oth in term s of accuracy an d cov erag e (S ection 3 .3 ). B efore d iscussin g these results, we b rie y illustrate the p ortion of the d ataset we hav e b een ex p erim en tin g with (S ection 3 .1 ), an d d escrib e how we hav e con d ucted the ex p erim en ts (S ection 3 .2 ).
B ased on our p re-an aly sis of the C iteU L ik e d ataset (S ec-tion 2 .1 ), we hav e p erform ed a cut, in ord er to ob tain a sm all y et m ean in g ful sub set to ex p erim en t with.

W e b eliev e that the results we are g oin g to p resen t in this section g en erally hold for d atasets that ex hib it sim ilar characteristics.
In ord er to q uan tify accuracy an d cov erag e of S ocial R an k -in g , we hav e con d ucted the followin g b asic ex p erim en t: we p ick ed up a user u , \ hid " on e of his b ook m ark ed p ap ers p as well as the tag s that u had associated to p ; we then p er-form ed a q uery q with such tag s. S in ce p was b ook m ark ed b y u (b efore we hid it), u is ob v iously in terested in it, so a recom m en d er sy stem should b e ab le to return p (cov erag e). N ote that, in our p run ed d ataset, it was alway s the case that, ev en after hid in g u 's b ook m ark for p , at least an other b ook m ark m ad e b y a user u 0 for p ex isted , as we on ly k ep t in the d ataset those p ap ers that had b een b ook m ark ed b y m ore than on e user; it should thus b e p ossib le, in p rin cip le, to locate an d return p . M oreov er, the hig hest the ran k in g of p in the list of return ed p ap ers (i.e., the closest to the top ), the b etter the accuracy of the ran k in g alg orithm .
G iv en the hig h v ariab ility of users' b ehav iour an d p ap ers' p op ularity in the d ataset, we hav e id en ti ed 6 d i eren t cat-eg ories of ex p erim en ts, b ased on : F or each user in each g roup (heav y / m ed ium / low tag g ers), three b ook m ark s where chosen at ran d om within each p a-p er categ ory (p op ular/ un p op ular), hid d en an d their corre-sp on d in g tag s searched . S in ce the n um b er of users in each g roup v aries, so d oes the total n um b er of q ueries p erform ed (from 1 ,8 0 0 for the sm all g roup of H T / P P , to 1 3 ,1 0 0 for the m uch larg er g roup of L T / U P ). R esults are rep orted for each categ ory . In all ex p erim en ts, we com p are the outp ut of our S ocial R an k in g alg orithm (form ula 2 ) with the sim p le b en chm ark p resen ted in S ection 2 .2 (form ula 1 ).
The rst set of experiments we conducted aimed to anal-y se the impact of users' similarity alone on the rank ing of re-sults. W e thus compared the b asic q uery model with the ad-v anced q uery model where tag expansion had b een disab led. F or each q uery , the list of returned papers is thus the same (i.e., the search happens using the same q uery tag s), b ut ordered di erently (i.e., users' similarity in S ocial R ank ing causes reshu es). F or each q uery that uncov ered the hid-den paper, we hav e computed the position of such paper in the rank ed list of results produced b y S ocial R ank ing minus its position in the rank ed list of results produced b y the b a-sic model: the lower the di erence, the b etter the accuracy of S ocial R ank ing , and v icev ersa. F ig ure 4 plots the results, sorted b y the measured di erence, for all six categ ories ( rst row for po p ula r pa pers and second row for unpo p ula r pa pers ); the two x v alues hig hlig hted in each chart represent the rst and last q uery for which the two approaches perform the same (i.e., the di erence in rank ing is z ero).

A s shown, the rank ing of results is slig htly b etter when using the b asic q uery model in the rst scenario: when fo-cusing on mainstream content (i.e., the hidden paper has b een tag g ed many times b y di erent users), simple searches b ased on exact tag matching work well enoug h. H owev er, in all other scenarios, the adv anced q uery model outper-forms the b asic one (i.e., it returns the hidden paper at a hig her rank ing in the v ast majority of cases). The improv e-ment is more dramatic when considering unpopular papers (second row), thus con rming the importance of weig hting the recommendations coming from similar users more, when look ing for less `mainstream' content. If we tak e a closer look at the `unpopular papers' set of results, we can notice that, on heav y tag g ers (F ig ure 4 (d)), 2 5 % of the hidden papers are returned at positions that are b etween 1 0 and 2 0 5 positions b etter using S ocial R ank ing than when using the b asic model, ag ainst only 7 % of cases where the b asic model result is b etter rank ed (b etween 1 0 and 1 3 0 positions g ap); on medium tag g ers (F ig ure 4 (e)), 3 1 % of results are b etter rank ed (with a g ap b etween 1 0 and 2 4 2 ) ag ainst 8 % (with g ap [1 0 , 1 4 4 ]); nally , on low tag g ers (F ig ure 4 (f)), the ratio is 2 8 % ag ainst 8 % , and similar rank ing g ap.
In order to b etter appreciate the improv ement ob tained in terms of accuracy , we hav e also plotted the cumulativ e distrib ution of the rank ing of the \ hidden" papers, using the adv anced model without q uery expansion and the b asic model, for unpopular papers. F ig ures 4 (g ) (h) and (i) (third row) illustrate the results: as shown, S ocial R ank ing neatly improv es the ab solute rank ing of the hidden paper, and it does so more ev idently for heav y and medium tag g ers, that is, for users whose similarity can b e b etter assessed thank s to their activ ity within the sy stem. F or example, ab out 3 0 % of the hidden papers are found in the top 5 positions using S o-cial R ank ing on heav y tag g ers, ag ainst 2 0 % using the b asic model. This rst set of experiments thus demonstrates our hy pothesis that users' similarity is e ectiv ely exploited b y S ocial R ank ing to improv e accuracy , and this is particularly important when try ing to dig out unpopular content.

L et us now focus on cov erag e. The column lab eled ` k = 0 ' in Tab le 1 summarises the percentag e of papers that re-mained hidden when tag expansion was not used. A s shown,
Table 1: Percentage of queries remaining hidden. this percentage is approximately 16-18% for popular papers, and it q uik cly increases up to 4 0 % for unpopular ones. G iv en that all papers in our d ataset hav e b een b ook mark ed b y more than one user, low cov erage is an ind ication that di er-en t u sers boo km a rk th e sa m e reso u rces di eren tly . S earching techniq ues b ased on user-speci ed q uery-tags only are thus unab le to uncov er unpopular yet relev ant resources; in the next section, w e d emonstrate how cov erage can b e improv ed b y expand ing user-d e ned q uery tags to includ e semantically related ones.
T he second set of experiments w e hav e cond ucted aimed at comparing the full S ocial R ank ing mod el against the b a-sic one. D uring q uery expansion, S ocial R ank ing extend s each q uery tag w ith the top k N N tags. W e hav e b een ex-perimenting w ith d i erent v alues of k = 5 ; 10 ; 2 0 ; 5 0 ; w e hav e b een measuring the impact of the full mod el on b oth accuracy and cov erage. O ur goal w as to neatly improv e cov erage, especially w hen d ealing w ith unpopular content, w ithout sev erely impacting on accuracy.

T ab le 1 reports the percentage of q ueries for w hich the target paper still remained hid d en, across all v alues of k (includ ing k = 0 , that is, no q uery expansion). A s show n, ev en small v alues of k cause the numb er of not-found items to q uick ly d rop. F or example, w hen k = 5 , the numb er of u n po p u la r items not found falls from 2 4 % for heav y taggers, 3 6% for med ium taggers, and 4 0 % for low taggers, do w n to 14 %, 2 2 %, and 2 6% for the three users' categories respec-tiv ely. F or k = 10 , there is an av erage 5 0 % red uction of not-found items, w ith respect to the case of no q uery ex-pansion ( k = 0 ). C ov erage k eeps improv ing, although less d ramatically, for higher v alues of k .

In ord er to assess the impact of q uery expansion on accu-racy, w e report tw o separate sets of results. F or those q ueries that w ere uncov ered b y b oth S ocial rank ing and the b asic q uery mod el, w e hav e computed the percen tiles of the rank -ing of the \ hid d en" paper. T ab le 2 show s results across all 6 scenarios (S ocial R ank ing positions on the left of each cell, and b asic q uery mod el positions on the right). W e only re-port results for k = 10 and k = 2 0 for space reasons. W hen b oth approaches uncov er a paper, accuracy is comparab le: for instance, 10 % of the hid d en papers are found in the top 5 positions; half of the hid d en papers (5 0 th percentile) are found in the top 10 positions in the case of popular papers, and in the top 4 0 positions in the case of unpopular papers, b y b oth approaches. T his con rms that the improv ement ob tained on cov erage v ia q uery expansion d oes not compro-mise accuracy for v alues of k up to 2 0 ; this is aligned w ith our pre-analysis of the d ataset, w hich rev ealed that the v ast majority of papers w ere tagged w ith no more than 10 d if-ferent tags: increasing k much b eyond that v alue increases noise instead (w ith only a small improv ement on cov erage, as con rmed b y T ab le 1).

F inally, for the set of q ueries uncov ered b y S ocial R ank ing only, w e hav e computed the cumulativ e d istrib ution of their rank ing. O nce again, for space concerns, w e only d isplay the results for the critical case of u n po p u la r pa pers and for k = 10 (F igure 5 ). A s the charts illustrate, more than 4 0 % of the papers that could not b e found using the b asic mod el, are now returned in the top 10 0 positions (and b etw een 2 0 % and 3 0 % of them in the top 5 0 ). T his second set of experi-ments thus d emonstrates that tags' similarity can ind eed b e exploited , not just to uncov er relev ant content, b ut also to recommend it highly, so to b ring it to the attention of the end user.
R esearch in the area of social tagging has proliferated in recent years, d ue to the increasing popularity of such sys-tems. S tud ies hav e b een cond ucted b oth to und erstand tag usage and ev olution (e.g., [2 3 , 3 ]), and to learn and exploit their hid d en semantics. In [7 ], a large stud y of social tagging on the popular d el.icio.us b ook mark ing system is presented , aimed at characteriz ing users' activ ity, pages' popularity, and tags' d istrib ution; the k now led ge b ase (in this case, the w hole W eb ) is so large and d ynamic that the authors are q uite pessimistic on the b ene ts that social b ook mark ing can b ring to w eb searches. In [6], the same authors hav e show n how searches on d el.icio.us can b e improv ed if a nav -igab le hierarchical taxonomy of tags is d eriv ed from tag us-age, to help users b road ening/ narrow ing the set of tags that b est d escrib e their interests. O ur approach tak es a d i er-ent stance, and rather than o ering users an organised tag nav igation system, it aims to transparently improv e users' searches b ased on emergent tags semantics and q uery ex-pansion. In [18], tags are related b ack to a xed ontology of concepts, thus exploiting b oth techniq ues to enhance infor-mation retriev al capab ilities. D i erently from this approach, our goal is to autonomically d eriv e tags' relationships, w hich can then b e tted into an e ectiv e q uery search algorithm, w ithout relying on a pre xed ontology. In [2 0 ], semantics that speci cally relate to places and ev ents are inferred for resources w ithin the F lick r d ataset; their approach is highly tied to location information, and thus not easily generaliz -ab le to other d omains. In [2 5 ], a prob ab ilistic generativ e mod el is proposed to d escrib e users' annotation b ehav iour, and to automatically d eriv e tags emergent semantics; d ur-ing searches, their approach is capab le of grouping together synonymous tags, w hile it calls for user's interv ention w hen highly amb iguous tags are found . V ery early w ork , b ut w ith similar goals, is presented in [2 6], w here a simpler techniq ue, b ased on an analysis of the relationship b etw een users, tags and resources, is proposed to d isamb iguate tags. T ag sys-tems hav e recently rev ealed their susceptib ility to tag spam, that is, malicious annotations generated to confuse users. T he prob lem has b een w ell analysed in [13 ], w here the au-thors tried to id entify misused tags, and q uantify the extent to w hat tagging systems are rob ust against spam. R ob ust solutions to tag spamming are still b eing inv estigated .
R esearch has b een v ery activ e also in relating tag activ ity to users, in ord er to d iscov er their interests and conseq uently users' communities. W ork w ithin the S emantic W eb d omain has tried to classify users into categories and d escrib e the k ey features of such categories [15 ].
