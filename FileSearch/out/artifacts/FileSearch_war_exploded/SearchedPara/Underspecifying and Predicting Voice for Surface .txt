 of voice and word order alternations in a free word order language. Given a set of meaning-equivalent candidate sentences, such as in the simplified En-glish Example (1), our model makes predictions about which candidate sentence is most appropriate or natural given the context.
We address the problem of predicting the usage of linguistic alternations in the framework of a surface realisation ranking system. Such ranking systems are practically relevant for the real-world applica-tion of grammar-based generators that usually gen-erate several grammatical surface sentences from a given abstract input, e.g. (Velldal and Oepen, 2006). Moreover, this framework allows for detailed exper-imental studies of the interaction of specific linguis-tic features. Thus it has been demonstrated that for free word order languages like German, word or-der prediction quality can be improved with care-fully designed, linguistically informed models cap-turing information-structural strategies (Filippova and Strube, 2007; Cahill and Riester, 2009).

This paper is situated in the same framework, us-ing rich linguistic representations over corpus data for machine learning of realisation ranking. How-ever, we go beyond the task of finding the correct or-dering for an almost fixed set of word forms. Quite obviously, word order is only one of the means at a speaker X  X  disposal for expressing some content in a contextually appropriate form; we add systematic alternations like the voice alternation (active vs. pas-sive) to the picture. As an alternative way of pro-moting or demoting the prominence of a syntactic argument, its interaction with word ordering strate-gies in real corpus data is of high theoretical interest (Aissen, 1999; Aissen, 2003; Bresnan et al., 2001).
Our main goals are (i) to establish a corpus-based surface realisation framework for empirically inves-tigating interactions of voice and word order in Ger-man, (ii) to design an input representation for gen-eration capturing voice alternations in a variety of contexts, (iii) to better understand the relationship between the performance of a generation ranking model and the type of realisation candidates avail-able in its input. In working towards these goals, this paper addresses the question of evaluation. We conduct a pilot human evaluation on the voice al-ternation data and relate our findings to our results established in the automatic ranking experiments.
Addressing interactions among a range of gram-matical and discourse phenomena on realistic corpus data turns out to be a major methodological chal-lenge for data-driven surface realisation. The set of candidate realisations available for ranking will in-fluence the findings, and here, existing surface re-alisers vary considerably. Belz et al. (2010) point out the differences across approaches in the type of syntactic and semantic information present and ab-sent in the input representation; and it is the type of underspecification that determines the number (and character) of available candidate realisations and, hence, the complexity of the realisation task.
We study the effect of varying degrees of under-specification explicitly, extending a syntactic gen-eration system by a semantic component capturing voice alternations. In regeneration studies involving underspecified underlying representations, corpus-oriented work reveals an additional methodological challenge. When using standard semantic represen-tations, as common in broad-coverage work in se-mantic parsing (i.e., from the point of view of analy-sis), alternative variants for sentence realisation will often receive slightly different representations: In the context of (1), the continuation (1-c) is presum-ably more natural than (1-b), but with a standard sentence-bounded semantic analysis, only (1-a) and (1-b) would receive equivalent representations.
Rather than waiting for the availability of robust and reliable techniques for detecting the reference of implicit arguments in analysis (or for contextually aware reasoning components), we adopt a relatively simple heuristic approach (see Section 3.1) that ap-proximates the desired equivalences by augmented representations for examples like (1-c). This way we can overcome an extremely skewed distribution in the naturally occurring meaning-equivalent active vs. passive sentences, a factor which we believe jus-tifies taking the risk of occasional overgeneration.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 situ-ates our methodology with respect to other work on surface realisation and briefly summarises the rele-vant theoretical linguistic background. In Section 3, we present our generation architecture and the de-sign of the input representation. Section 4 describes the setup for the experiments in Section 5. In Section 6, we present the results from the human evaluation. 2.1 Generation Background The first widely known data-driven approach to surface realisation, or tactical generation, (Langk-ilde and Knight, 1998) used language-model n -gram statistics on a word lattice of candidate re-alisations to guide a ranker. Subsequent work ex-plored ways of exploiting linguistically annotated data for trainable generation models (Ratnaparkhi, 2000; Marciniak and Strube, 2005; Belz, 2005, a.o.). Work on data-driven approaches has led to insights into the importance of linguistic features for sen-tence linearisation decisions (Ringger et al., 2004; Filippova and Strube, 2009). The availability of dis-criminative learning techniques for the ranking of candidate analyses output by broad-coverage gram-mars with rich linguistic representations, originally in parsing (Riezler et al., 2000; Riezler et al., 2002), has also led to a revival of interest in linguistically sophisticated reversible grammars as the basis for surface realisation (Velldal and Oepen, 2006; Cahill et al., 2007). The grammar generates candidate analyses for an underlying representation and the ranker X  X  task is to predict the contextually appropri-ate realisation.
 The work that is most closely related to ours is Velldal (2008). He uses an MRS representation derived by an HPSG grammar that can be under-specified for information status. In his case, the underspecification is encoded in the grammar and not directly controlled. In multilingually oriented linearisation work, Bohnet et al. (2010) generate from semantic corpus annotations included in the CoNLL X 09 shared task data. However, they note that these annotations are not suitable for full generation since they are often incomplete. Thus, it is not clear to which degree these annotations are actually un-derspecified for certain paraphrases. 2.2 Linguistic Background In competition-based linguistic theories (Optimal-ity Theory and related frameworks), the use of argument alternations is construed as an effect of markedness hierarchies (Aissen, 1999; Aissen, 2003). Argument functions (subject, object, . . . ) on the one hand and the various properties that argu-ment phrases can bear (person, animacy, definite-ness) on the other are organised in markedness hi-erarchies. Wherever possible, there is a tendency to align the hierarchies, i.e., use prominent functions to realise prominently marked argument phrases. For instance, Bresnan et al. (2001) find that there is a sta-tistical tendency in English to passivise a verb if the patient is higher on the person scale than the agent, but an active is grammatically possible.

Bresnan et al. (2007) correlate the use of the En-glish dative alternation to a number of features such as givenness, pronominalisation, definiteness, con-stituent length, animacy of the involved verb argu-ments. These features are assumed to reflect the dis-course acessibility of the arguments.

Interestingly, the properties that have been used to model argument alternations in strict word or-der languages like English have been identified as factors that influence word order in free word or-der languages like German, see Filippova and Strube (2007) for a number of pointers. Cahill and Riester (2009) implement a model for German word or-der variation that approximates the information sta-tus of constituents through morphological features like definiteness, pronominalisation etc. We are not aware of any corpus-based generation studies inves-tigating how these properties relate to argument al-ternations in free word order languages. Our data-driven methodology for investigating fac-tors relevant to surface realisation uses a regen-grammar-based component used to parse a corpus sentence and map it to all its meaning-equivalent surface realisations, b) a statistical ranking compo-nent used to select the correct, i.e. contextually most appropriate surface realisation. Two variants of this set-up that we use are sketched in Figure 1.
 We generally use a hand-crafted, broad-coverage LFG for German (Rohrer and Forst, 2006) to parse and generate all surface realisations from a given f-structure, following the generation approach of Cahill et al. (2007). F-structures are attribute-value matrices representing grammatical functions and morphosyntactic features; their theoretical mo-tivation lies in the abstraction over details of sur-face realisation. The grammar is implemented in the XLE framework (Crouch et al., 2006), which allows for reversible use of the same declarative grammar in the parsing and generation direction.

To obtain a more abstract underlying representa-tion (in the pipeline on the right-hand side of Fig-ure 1), the present work uses an additional seman-tic construction component (Crouch and King, 2006; Zarrie X , 2009) to map LFG f-structures to meaning representations. For the reverse direction, the mean-ing representations are mapped to f-structures which can then be mapped to surface strings by the XLE generator (Zarrie X  and Kuhn, 2010).

For the final realisation ranking step in both pipelines, we used SVMrank, a Support Vector Machine-based learning tool (Joachims, 1996). The ranking step is thus technically independent from the LFG-based component. However, the grammar is used to produce the training data, pairs of corpus sentences and the possible alternations.

The two pipelines allow us to vary the degree to which the generation input is underspecified. An f-structure abstracts away from word order, i.e. the candidate set will contain just word order alterna-tions. In the semantic input, syntactic function and voice are underspecified, so a larger set of surface realisation candidates is generated. Figure 2 illus-trates the two representation levels for an active and a passive sentence. The subject of the passive and the object of the active f-structure are mapped to the same role (patient) in the meaning representation. 3.1 Issues with  X  X aive X  underspecification In order to create an underspecified voice represen-tation that does indeed leave open the realisation op-tions available to the speaker/writer, it is often not sufficient to remove just the syntactic function in-formation. For instance, the subject of the active sentence (2) is an arbitrary reference pronoun man  X  X ne X  which cannot be used as an oblique agent in a passive, sentence (2-b) is ungrammatical.
So, when combined with the grammar, the mean-ing representation for (2) in Figure 2 contains im-plicit information about the voice of the original cor-pus sentence; the candidate set will not include any passive realisations. However, a passive realisation without the oblique agent in the by -phrase, as in Ex-ample (3), is a very natural variant.
The reverse situation arises frequently too: pas-sive sentences where the agent role is not overtly realised. Given the standard,  X  X nalysis-oriented X  meaning representation for Sentence (4) in Figure 2, the realiser will not generate an active realisation since the agent role cannot be instantiated by any phrase in the grammar. However, depending on the exact context there are typically options for realis-ing the subject phrase in an active with very little descriptive content.

Ideally, one would like to account for these phe-nomena in a meaning representation that under-specifies the lexicalisation of discourse referents, and also captures the reference of implicit argu-ments. Especially the latter task has hardly been addressed in NLP applications (but see Gerber and Chai (2010)). In order to work around that problem, we implemented some simple heuristics which un-derspecify the realisation of certain verb arguments. These rules define: 1. a set of pronouns (generic and neutral pronouns, universal quantifiers) that corre-spond to  X  X rivial X  agents in active and implicit agents in passive sentences; 2. a set of prepositional ad-juncts in passive sentences that correspond to sub-jects in active sentence (e.g. causative and instru-mental prepositions like durch  X  by means of  X ); 3. certain syntactic contexts where special underspec-ification devices are needed, e.g. coordinations or embeddings, see Zarrie X  and Kuhn (2010) for ex-amples. In the following, we will distinguish 1-role transitives where the agent is  X  X rivial X  or implicit from 2-role transitives with a non-implicit agent.
By means of the extended underspecification rules for voice, the sentences in (2) and (3) receive an identical meaning representation. As a result, our surface realiser can produce an active alternation for (3) and a passive alternation for (2). In the follow-ing, we will refer to the extended representations as SEM representations as SEM
We are aware of the fact that these approximations introduce some noise into the data and do not always represent the underlying referents correctly. For in-stance, the implicit agent in a passive need not be  X  X rivial X  but can correspond to an actual discourse referent. However, we consider these heuristics as a first step towards capturing an important discourse function of the passive alternation, namely the dele-tion of the agent role. If we did not treat the passives with an implicit agent on a par with certain actives, we would have to ignore a major portion of the pas-sives occurring in corpus data.

Table 1 summarises the distribution of the voices for the heuristic meaning representation SEM the data-set we will introduce in Section 4, with the distribution for the naive representation SEM in parentheses. Data To obtain a sizable set of realistic corpus ex-amples for our experiments on voice alternations, we created our own dataset of input sentences and rep-resentations, instead of building on treebank exam-ples as Cahill et al. (2007) do. We extracted 19,905 sentences, all containing at least one transitive verb, from the HGC, a huge German corpus of newspa-per text (204.5 million tokens). The sentences are automatically parsed with the German LFG gram-mar. The resulting f-structure parses are transferred to meaning representations and mapped back to f-structure charts. For our generation experiments, we only use those f-structure charts that the XLE generator can map back to a set of surface realisa-tions. This results in a total of 1236 test sentences and 8044 sentences in our training set. The data loss is mostly due to the fact the XLE generator often fails on incomplete parses, and on very long sen-tences. Nevertheless, the average sentence length (17.28) and number of surface realisations (see Ta-ble 2) are higher than in Cahill et al. (2007). Labelling For the training of our ranking model, we have to tell the learner how closely each surface realisation candidate resembles the original corpus sentence. We distinguish the rank categories:  X 1 X  identical to the corpus string,  X 2 X  identical to the corpus string ignoring punctuation,  X 3 X  small edit distance ( &lt; 4) to the corpus string ignoring punc-tuation,  X 4 X  different from the corpus sentence. In one of our experiments (Section 5.1), we used the rank category  X 5 X  to explicitly label the surface real-isations derived from the alternation f-structure that does not correspond to the parse of the original cor-pus sentence. The intermediate rank categories  X 2 X  and  X 3 X  are useful since the grammar does not al-ways regenerate the exact corpus string, see Cahill et al. (2007) for explanation.
 Features The linguistic theories sketched in Sec-tion 2.2 correlate morphological, syntactic and se-mantic properties of constituents (or discourse ref-erents) with their order and argument realisation. In our system, this correlation is modelled by a combi-nation of linguistic properties that can be extracted from the f-structure or meaning representation and of the surface order that is read off the sentence string. Standard n -gram features are also used as for every lemma in the f-structure, we extract a set of morphological properties (definiteness, person, pronominal status etc.), the voice of the verbal head, its syntactic and semantic role, and a set of infor-mations status features following Cahill and Riester (2009). These properties are combined in two ways: a) Precedence features: relative order of properties in the surface string, e.g.  X  X heme &lt; agent in pas-sive X ,  X 1st person &lt; 3rd person X ; b)  X  X cale align-ment X  features (ScalAl.): combinations of voice and role properties with morphological properties, e.g.  X  X ubject is singular X ,  X  X gent is 3rd person in active voice X  (these are surface-independent, identical for each alternation candidate).

The model for which we present our results is based on sentence-internal features only; as Cahill and Riester (2009) showed, these feature carry a considerable amount of implicit information about the discourse context (e.g. in the shape of referring expressions). We also implemented a set of explic-itly inter-sentential features, inspired by Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995). This model did not im-prove over the intra-sentential model.
 Evaluation Measures In order to assess the gen-eral quality of our generation ranking models, we Avg. # strings 36.7 68.2 75.8 Random Match 16.98 10.72 7.28 LM Ling. Model use several standard measures: a) exact match: how often does the model select the original cor-pus sentence, b) BLEU: n -gram overlap between top-ranked and original sentence, c) NIST: modifi-cation of BLEU giving more weight to less frequent n -grams. Second, we are interested in the model X  X  performance wrt. specific linguistic criteria. We re-port the following accuracies: d) Voice: how often does the model select a sentence realising the correct voice, e) Precedence: how often does the model gen-erate the right order of the verb arguments (agent and patient), and f) Vorfeld: how often does the model correctly predict the verb arguments to appear in the sentence initial position before the finite verb, the so-called Vorfeld . See Sections 5.3 and 6 for a dis-cussion of these measures. 5.1 Exp. 1: Effect of Underspecified Input We investigate the effect of the input X  X  underspecifi-cation on a state-of-the-art surface realisation rank-ing model. This model implements the entire fea-ture set described in Section 4 (it is further analysed in the subsequent experiments). We built 3 datasets from our alternation data: FS -candidates generated from the f-structure; SEM naive meaning representations; SEM from the heuristically underspecified meaning rep-resentation. Thus, we keep the set of original cor-pus sentences (=the target realisations) constant, but train and test the model on different candidate sets.
In Table 2, we compare the performance of the linguistically informed model described in Section 4 on the candidates sets against a random choice and a language model (LM) baseline. The differences in BLEU between the candidate sets and models are All Trans.

 model largely outperforms the LM and is less sen-sitive to the additional confusion introduced by the SEM decrease only slightly (though statistically signifi-cantly).

In Table 3, we report the performance of the lin-guistic model on the different candidate sets with re-spect to voice accuracy. Since the candidate sets dif-fer in the proportion of items that underspecify the voice (see  X  X oice Spec. X  in Table 3), we also report the accuracy on the SEM set of SEM specified. Table 3 shows that the proportion of active realisations for the SEM the model does not outperform the majority baseline (which always selects active). In contrast, the SEM model clearly outperforms the majority baseline.
Example (4) is a case from our development set where the SEM tive (4-a), and the SEM (4-b). This prediction is according to the markedness hier-archy: the patient is singular and definite, the agent Features Match BLEU Voice Prec. VF Prec. 16.3 0.70 88.43 64.1 59.1 ScalAl. 10.4 0.64 90.37 58.9 56.3 Union 26.4 0.75 91.50 80.2 70.9 is plural and indefinite. Counterexamples are possi-ble, but there is a clear statistical preference  X  which the model was able to pick up.

On the one hand, the rankers can cope surpris-ingly well with the additional realisations obtained from the meaning representations. According to the global sentence overlap measures, their quality is not seriously impaired. On the other hand, the de-sign of the representations has a substantial effect on the prediction of the alternations. The SEM does not seem to learn certain preferences because of the extremely imbalanced distribution in the in-put data. This confirms the hypothesis sketched in Section 3.1, according to which the degree of the input X  X  underspecification can crucially change the behaviour of the ranking model. 5.2 Exp. 2: Word Order and Voice We examine the impact of certain feature types on the prediction of the variation types in our data. We are particularly interested in the interaction of voice and word order (precedence) since linguistic theo-ries (see Section 2.2) predict similar information-structural factors guiding their use, but usually do not consider them in conjunction.

In Table 4, we report the performance of ranking models trained on the different feature subsets intro-duced in Section 4. The union of the features corre-sponds to the model trained on SEM 1. At a very broad level, the results suggest that the precedence and the scale alignment features interact both in the prediction of voice and word order.
The most pronounced effect on voice accuracy can be seen when comparing the precedence model to the union model. Adding the surface-independent scale alignment features to the precedence features leads to a big improvement in the prediction of word order. This is not a trivial observation since a) the surface-independent features do not discriminate be-tween the word orders and b) the precedence fea-tures are built from the same properties (see Sec-tion 4). Thus, the SVM learner discovers depen-dencies between relative precedence preferences and abstract properties of a verb argument which cannot be encoded in the precedence alone.

It is worth noting that the precedence features im-prove the voice prediction. This indicates that wher-ever the application context allows it, voice should not be specified at a stage prior to word order. Ex-ample (5) is taken from our development set, illus-trating a case where the union model predicted the correct voice and word order (5-a), and the scale alignment model top-ranked the incorrect voice and word order. The active verb arguments in (5-b) are both case-ambigous and placed in the non-canonical order (object &lt; subject), so the semantic relation can be easily misunderstood. The passive in (5-a) is un-ambiguous since the agent is realised in a PP (and placed in the Vorfeld). Moreover, our results confirm Filippova and Strube (2007) who find that it is harder to predict the correct Vorfeld occupant in a German sentence, than to predict the relative order of the constituents. 5.3 Exp. 3: Capturing Flexible Variation The previous experiment has shown that there is a certain inter-dependence between word order and voice. This experiment addresses this interaction by varying the way the training data for the ranker is labelled. We contrast two ways of labelling the sentences (see Section 4): a) all sentences that are not (nearly) identical to the reference sentence have the rank category  X 4 X , irrespective of their voice (re-ferred to as unlabelled model), b) the sentences that do not realise the correct voice are ranked lower than sentences with the correct voice ( X 4 X  vs.  X 5 X ), re-ferred to as labelled model. Intuitively, the latter way of labelling tells the ranker that all sentences in the incorrect voice are worse than all sentences in the correct voice, independent of the word order. Given the first labelling strategy, the ranker can de-cide in an unsupervised way which combinations of word order and voice are to be preferred. Labelled, no LM 21.52 0.73 12.93 91.9 76.25 71.01 78.35 82.31 Unlabelled, no LM 26.83 0.75 13.01 91.5 80.19 74.51 84.28 88.59 Unlabeled + LM 27.35 0.75 13.08 91.5 79.6 73.92 79.74 82.89
In Table 5, it can be seen that the unlabelled model improves over the labelled on all the sentence over-lap measures. The improvements are statistically significant. Moreover, we compare the n-best ac-curacies achieved by the models for the joint pre-diction of voice and argument order. The unla-belled model is very flexible with respect to the word order-voice interaction: the accuracy dramatically improves when looking at the top 3 sentences. Ta-ble 5 also reports the performance of an unlabelled model that additionally integrates LM scores. Sur-prisingly, these scores have a very small positive ef-fect on the sentence overlap features and no positive effect on the voice and precedence accuracy. The n-best evaluations even suggest that the LM scores negatively impact the ranker: the accuracy for the top 3 sentences increases much less as compared to
The n -best performance of a realisation ranker is practically relevant for re-ranking applications such as Velldal (2008). We think that it is also concep-tually interesting. Previous evaluation studies sug-gest that the original corpus sentence is not always the only optimal realisation of a given linguistic in-put (Cahill and Forst, 2010; Belz and Kow, 2010). Humans seem to have varying preferences for word order contrasts in certain contexts. The n-best evalu-ation could reflect the behaviour of a ranking model with respect to the range of variations encountered in real discourse. The pilot human evaluation in the next Section deals with this question. Our experiment in Section 5.3 has shown that the ac-curacy of our linguistically informed ranking model dramatically increases when we consider the three best sentences rather than only the top-ranked sen-tence. This means that the model sometimes predicts almost equal naturalness for different voice realisa-tions. Moreover, in the case of word order, we know from previous evaluation studies, that humans some-times prefer different realisations than the original corpus sentences. This Section investigates agree-ment in human judgements of voice realisation.
Whereas previous studies in generation mainly used human evaluation to compare different sys-tems, or to correlate human and automatic evalua-tions, our primary interest is the agreement or cor-relation between human rankings. In particular, we explore the hypothesis that this agreement is higher in certain contexts than in others. In order to select these contexts, we use the predictions made by our ranking model.

The questionnaire for our experiment comprised 24 items falling into 3 classes: a) items where the 3 best sentences predicted by the model have the same voice as the original sentence ( X  X orrect X ), b) items where the 3 top-ranked sentences realise dif-ferent voices ( X  X ixed X ), c) items where the model predicted the incorrect voice in all 3 top sentences ( X  X alse X ). Each item is composed of the original sentence, the 3 top-ranked sentences (if not identical to the corpus sentence) and 2 further sentences such that each item contains different voices. For each item, we presented the previous context sentence.
The experiment was completed by 8 participants, all native speakers of German, 5 had a linguistic background. The participants were asked to rank each sentence on a scale from 1-6 according to its naturalness and plausibility in the given context. The participants were explicitly allowed to use the same rank for sentences they find equally natural. The par-ticipants made heavy use of this option: out of the 192 annotated items, only 8 are ranked such that no two sentences have the same rank.

We compare the human judgements by correlat-ing them with Spearman X  X   X  . This measure is con-sidered appropriate for graded annotation tasks in general (Erk and McCarthy, 2009), and has also been used for analysing human realisation rankings (Velldal, 2008; Cahill and Forst, 2010). We nor-malise the ranks according to the procedure in Vell-dal (2008). In Table 6, we report the correlations obtained from averaging over all pairwise correla-tions between the participants and the correlations restricted to the item and sentence classes. We used bootstrap re-sampling on the pairwise correlations to test that the correlations on the different item classes significantly differ from each other.

The correlations in Table 6 suggest that the agree-ment between annotators is highest on the false items, and lowest on the mixed items. Humans tended to give the best rank to the original sentence more often on the false items (91%) than on the oth-ers. Moreover, the agreement is generally higher on the sentences realising the correct voice.

These results seem to confirm our hypothesis that the general level of agreement between humans dif-fers depending on the context. However, one has to be careful in relating the effects in our data solely to voice preferences. Since the sentences were chosen automatically, some examples contain very unnatu-ral word orders that probably guided the annotators X  decisions more than the voice. This is illustrated by Example (6) showing two passive sentences from our questionnaire which differ only in the position of the adverb besser  X  X etter X  . Sentence (6-a) is com-pletely implausible for a native speaker of German, whereas Sentence (6-b) sounds very natural.
This observation brings us back to our initial point that the surface realisation task is especially chal-lenging due to the interaction of a range of semantic and discourse phenomena. Obviously, this interac-tion makes it difficult to single out preferences for a specific alternation type. Future work will have to establish how this problem should be dealt with in  X  X ll X  sent. 0.58 0.6 0.54 0.62  X  X orrect X  sent. 0.64 0.63 0.56 0.72  X  X alse X  sent. 0.47 0.57 0.48 0.44
Top-ranked corpus sent. the design of human evaluation experiments. We have presented a grammar-based generation ar-chitecture which implements the surface realisation of meaning representations abstracting from voice and word order. In order to be able to study voice alternations in a variety of contexts, we designed heuristic underspecification rules which establish, for instance, the alternation relation between an ac-tive with a generic agent and a passive that does not overtly realise the agent. This strategy leads to a better balanced distribution of the alternations in the training data, such that our linguistically informed generation ranking model achieves high BLEU scores and accurately predicts active and pas-sive. In future work, we will extend our experiments to a wider range of alternations and try to capture inter-sentential context more explicitly. Moreover, it would be interesting to carry over our methodology to a purely statistical linearisation system where the relation between an input representation and a set of candidate realisations is not so clearly defined as in a grammar-based system.

Our study also addressed the interaction of dif-ferent linguistic variation types, i.e. word order and voice, by looking at different types of linguis-tic features and exploring different ways of labelling the training data. However, our SVM-based learn-ing framework is not well-suited to directly assess the correlation between a certain feature (or fea-ture combination) and the occurrence of an alterna-tion. Therefore, it would be interesting to relate our work to the techniques used in theoretical papers, e.g. (Bresnan et al., 2007), where these correlations are analysed more directly.
