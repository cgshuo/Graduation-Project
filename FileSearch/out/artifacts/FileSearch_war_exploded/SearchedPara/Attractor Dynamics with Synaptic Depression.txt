 The network dynamics is governed by two time scales. The time constants of STD is typically in  X  dynamical behaviors.

When STD is weak, the network behaves similarly with CANNs wi thout STD, that is, the static bump state is present up to k near 1. However, when  X  increases, a state with the bump sponta-neously moving at a constant velocity comes into existence. Such moving states have been pre-moving state is present. 3.2 The Plateau Behavior slowly to silence, in the time order of  X  3.3 Enhanced Tracking Performance bump tends to overshoot the target before eventually approa ching it.

 We have also analyzed the dynamics of CANNs with STD using a Ga ussian approximation of the Besides STD, there are other forms of STP that may be relevant to realizing short-term memory. STF has the opposite effect in modifying the neuronal connec tion weights. The underlying bio-of STD tends to be stronger than that of STF. Different from th e STF-based mechanism, our work our goal in future work to explore the joint impact of STD and S TF on the dynamics of neuronal networks.
