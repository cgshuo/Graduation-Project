 Most of phenomena existing in the world are dynamic and vagueness is their inherent feature. In GIS community, models for vague objects[3, 5, 7] do not include the time dimension of objects. Besides that, spatiotemporal data models (STDM) have also been introduced to deal with time-varying spatial objects, but they do not accommo-date fuzzy aspect of objects[2, 6, 12]. For the purpose of this paper, we concentrate on their extents over time. We propose an FSTDM, outcome of the aggregation of spa-tial, temporal and fuzzy components into a single framework, based on fuzzy set the-or social (demographic, h ealth, ect.) applications. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Data models for crisp objects are re-viewed in the next section. Section 3 presents an FSTDM followed by the integration method of fuzzy spatial and temporal operations. In section 5, the experimental result is displayed. Conclusions and future work are given in section 6. This section summarizes several STDM and models for geospatial objects with vague boundaries. Definitions for fuzzy regions and their fuzzy spatial topological relation-ship are given. 2.1 STDM and Models for Geospatial Objects with Indeterminate Boundaries need developing in parallel with the independent spatial[8] and temporal[9] query language development[12]. At present, ther e are several approaches available to rep-objects with sharp boundaries to that for objects with unclear boundaries[3]. Because restricted, the original gradation in the me mbership values of the points of the bound-ary gets lost[7]. 2.2 Definition of Fuzzy Regions and Fuzzy Spatial Relationship  X  -1 and  X  F is the level set  X   X  [0,1] representing distinct  X  -cuts of F . regions P and S . It is determined by the following formula: [0,1]. With that way, a set of eight fuzzy predicates between two fuzzy regions T Following is the description of the data model. We examine the two-dimensional geographic space and linear time. 
The data model can be viewed as a hierarchy of data. Map at the top level is a li-brary of space-time cubes, called thematic layers. Each thematic layer consists of a set layer characterizing a theme. 
Regions extracted from field observation data. Due to the vagueness of object class definition, for each individual location P ij a membership function value vector vector time points should be linked to form lifetime of the objects. An object that appears at a specific moment represents a new object, and disappears at some moment represents a disappearing object. They can be merged or split . 
The design of FSTDB is based on the integration of independent researches on spa-been changed with temporal evolution. In view of temporal databases, it is extremely hard to manage directly spatial objects without any modification. Definition 1. FSTDB Scheme denotes the beginning and ending time of valid time, and prev is a historical pointer of hid denotes the historical pointer of the object determined by fid in the feature history relation. The merge relation MR i stores only history information of spatial objects in which merge operation occurs. operators. Temporal predicates including before, equal, meets, overlaps, during, VT poral_Operator( VTs , VTe,begin , end,Top ) verifies if VT 1 and VT 2 has the relation Top . 
Since fuzzy spatial predicates are embedded into query languages via the qualita-tive linguistic descriptions of fuzzy topological relations. For example, depending on and completely contain , where not, somewhat, quite, completely are called fuzzy fier( not, somewhat, quite, completely ); Then activate it: Set Fquantifier; 
Given two fuzzy regions P and S the function FS_Operator() verifies if they satisfy a given quantified fuzzy spatial predicate Fq.Sop composed of a fuzzy quanti-fier Fq and a spatial predicate Sop using equation 1. Function Boolean FS_Operator( P,S,Fq,Sop ) Begin for ( j =1; j &lt; N ; j ++) -Identify  X  -cut regions P  X  i and S  X  j and check if they satisfy Sop using semantics of spatial operators between simple crisp regions in[4] -If the determined value crisprel = true then If ( result coincides the value defined for Fq in Fquantifier) then return  X  X alse X ; Else return  X  X rue X  End. 
With those pretreatments we are ready to define FST_Operator() as below which are used in  X  X here X  clause of query statements. Function Boolean FST_Operator( P, S, Top, Fq.Sop ) Begin Get time period of P &amp; S ( VTs,VTe ) and (begin,end )respectively Invoke Temporal_Operator( VTs,VTe,begin,end,Top ) If Temporal_Operator()is True Return FS_Operator( P,S,Fq.Sop ); Else return False; 
End. We now implement an FSTDB scheme by extending valid time and fuzziness in GIS and new operators. 5.1 Experimental Results Assume we have two relations: Pollution keeps information about factors causing region. LandUse stores information about the use of land areas and vague spatial extents. The valid time is used to represent the lifespan of objects. 
We define values for fuzzy quantifiers as Fquantifer{ not (0,0.05), some-what (0.05,0.5), quite (0.5,0.8), completely (0.8,1)}. 
An FST query can be  X  X earch regions are quite in polluted area caused by the Ce-gions retrieve from LandUse satisfying temporally overlap the time period  X 1990-2000 X  and spatially quite overlap the Cement Factory. 5.2 Comparison of Our Model to Previous Works Here, we compare our model to the prior models using criteria time semantics, query capability, and database scheme shown in table 1. The previous models address temporal, spatial, and ST query operations, but do not support fuzzy spatial types. An FST framework introduced in [10] only reasons the ST concepts with respect to fuzzy definition of FSTDB scheme and the new operators our work is directly applicable to the management of time-varying information of fuzzy spatial objects In this paper, we concentrated on the applications handling objects whose extents are vague and change over time. We introduced an FSTDM based on fuzzy set theory. Moreover, we introduced and implemented operators to help process queries relating to whether the predicate is fuzzy spatial, tem poral, or both. Our research is feasible to use in applications dealing with time-varying geospatial data, including global change, social applications. We are creating a richer set of operators and investigating a suitable indexing method to efficiently retrieve fuzzy spatial objects.
