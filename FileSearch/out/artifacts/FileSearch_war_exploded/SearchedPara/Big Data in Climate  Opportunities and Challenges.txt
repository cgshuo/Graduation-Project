 This talk will present an overview of research being done in a large interdisciplinary project on the development of novel data mining and machine learning approaches for analyzing massive amount of climate and ecosystem data now available from satellite and ground -based sensors, and physics -based climate model simulations. These information -rich data sets offer huge potential for monitoring, understanding, and predicting the behavior of the Earth's ecosystem and for advancing the science of glo bal change. This talk will discuss challenges in analyzing such data sets and some of our research results in mapping the dynamics of surface water globally as well as detecting deforestation and fires in tropical forests using data from Earth observing s atellites .
 Big data; spatio -temporal data; predictive models for imperfect, incomplete, and heterogeneous data; rare class detection; monitoring global water dynamics; identifying tropical forest fires.
 Vipin Kumar is a Regents Professor at the University of M innesota, where he holds the William Norris Endowed Chair in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Kumar's current research interests include data mining, high -performance computing, and th eir applications in Climate/Ecosystems and Biomedical domains. Kumar is the Lead PI of a 5 -year, $10 Million project, "Understanding Climate Change -A Data Driven Approach" funded by the NSF's Expeditions in Computing program. This project is focused on the development of novel data driven approaches to help understand climate change and its impact. He has authored over 300 research articles, and has coedited or coauthored 10 books including two text books ``Introduction to Parallel Computing'' and ``I ntroduction to Data Mining'', that are used world -wide and have been translated into many languages. Kumar co -founded SIAM International Conference on Data Mining and served as a founding co -editor -in-chief of Journal of Statistical Analysis and Data Mini ng (an official journal of the American Statistical Association). Kumar is a Fellow of the ACM, IEEE and AAAS. He received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee (2013), the Distinguished Alumnus Award from t he Computer Science Department, University of Maryland College Park (2009), and IEEE Computer Society's Technical Achievement Award (2005). Kumar's foundational research in data mining and its applications to scientific data was honored by the ACM SIGKDD 2 012 Innovation Award, which is the highest award for technical excellence in the field of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD).
