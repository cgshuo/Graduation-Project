 The introduction of laptops and wireless networks i n classrooms has increased the possibilities for student-teacher interaction. Here we explore the premises for this interaction by stu dying the use of ActiveClass, a system that enables students to ask questions electronically and anonymously in-class. The study emphasizes how the diverse prerequisites for teaching interact ion separates students even more in the classroom. We then sugges t a differentiated approach to the introduction of inte ractive technologies in the class room.

 Classroom technologies, user studies. Learning, ubiquitous computing, classroom interacti on. Recently, collaborative computing technologies have entered areas of education, supporting, for example, univer sity lectures. Universities are increasingly offering students new premises for learning such as electronic course discussion board s and in-class on-line interaction between teachers and students b y way of WiFi-enabled laptops and PDAs. Previous research highlig hts disadvantages with free use of laptops in the class rooms [4, 6] and advantages of deploying networked systems specifica lly for classroom use [9, 10]. But while the implications a re most often looked at in experimental settings such as supplyin g everyone in the classroom with a laptop, less attention has bee n given to the actual environment of university classrooms where s tudents have different goals, ambitions and different access to the technology. This conflict is likely to affect the lectures; whe re most interaction facilitating systems are developed for use by all s tudents, in reality students are not a homogeneous mass that will adopt the new technologies in a uniform fashion [3]. The aim of t he research presented here is to explore premises for technolog y enhanced classroom interaction in situ. By examining behavio r in a university classroom equipped with a wireless netwo rk and ActiveClass, a tool that promotes interaction betwe en teacher and students, we aim to inform the design of interactiv e classroom technologies. Our method is ethnographic and observ ational rather than experimental, since we found that the e veryday-world of the students most valuable to explore this way. The study aims to investigate the mundane behavior within the clas sroom and provide information into certain aspects of technol ogy-facilitated interaction through the use of ActiveClass. We find that the existing values and practices of a heterogeneous co llection of students affect the students X  attitude and thus als o their use of classroom facilitating technologies. We stress that this diversity amongst students should be considered when designin g and implementing classroom technologies. Before introdu cing the study further, we first review previous approaches to networked classroom systems and other classroom technologies. With the deployment of wireless networks at many un iversities, the possibilities for network-facilitated teaching have increased. Not all classroom-oriented systems depend on wirele ss networks but in-class remote interaction does, and we theref ore limit the scope of related research to this area. Several sys tems have been developed to provide teachers and students with an easy way to make and take quizzes in-class through either lapto ps or PDAs [2, 9]. This function, however, requires that all stude nts have access to the technology and that each piece is actually f ully functional at the time of the quiz. Franklin and Hammond point ou t that in practice this can be quite complicated; the chances of students forgetting their devices or of one of the devices not working are often greater than the chance of everything working smoothly [5]. In most traditional lecturing, the teacher is solel y responsible for interaction with the students. The teacher chooses to ask questions of the class and decides when students are allowed to comment on the lecture. Most teachers prefer a fairly high lev el of interaction and encourage students to ask any questions they ma y have. However, especially in large classes, this interact ion is not always easy to promote [2]. Students themselves differ in learning approach; studies of student behavior show, for exa mple, that students have different strategies for help-seeking , particular in large classes [7]. Many researchers have therefore suggested facilitating the student-lecture interaction throug h technical means. One approach is to focus on students X  abilit y to give feedback by means other than face-to-face. A tablet PC based Classroom Feedback System (CFS) at the University o f Washington enables students to give real time feedb ack to the teacher. Students with laptops can here give feedba ck attached directly to the slides shown by the teacher [2]. Th e feedback can be given by attaching one of three categories to a specific place in a slide:  X  X ot it X ,  X  X ore explanation X  and  X  X xample X  . The WILD services, presented by Steele et al, similarly supp ort quiz-taking, online questioning and simple real-time feedback to the lecturer, in regards to the quality of the lecture [9]. One disadvantage of wireless networks in the classr oom and students X  increasing access to and use of laptops i s the distraction that the laptop can create. Hembrooke and Gay found that students who were allowed to use their laptops duri ng a lecture did significantly worse on a subsequent quiz than t he students who were not [6]. This highlights one of the proble ms with interaction-facilitating technologies: they provide additional focus for attention. Unless the teacher specifically proh ibits the use of laptops in the classroom, the wireless networks wil l inevitably provide a source of distraction for students who br ing their devices to class. In our study we therefore address the compromises that have to be made in an increasingly technology saturated classroom setting. The system we investigated for the purpose of this paper, ActiveClass, was not significantly different from m any of the previous systems described here. The system was not even particularly new, having been in place for about a year and a half when our study took place. ActiveClass is part of a larger, campus-wide system at UC San Diego called Active Ca mpus, and has been evaluated on several occasions  X  but mainl y with focus on usability issues [8]. We found this tool to be a good candidate for studying student-teacher interaction in a reali stic situation where students use the technology on a voluntary ba sis. The application is built around three primary funct ions  X  questions, polls, and ratings. The questions sectio n allows students to ask questions anonymously over the inte rnet and to vote on which questions they think most require an answer. Anyone in the class can answer the questions as wel l  X  and do this anonymously, but most of the time, questions are me ant to be raised in class and answered by the teacher. The po lls section enables the administrator to post a question, for e xample about the students X  preference for the next lecture and the s tudents can then vote in real-time; however, this section was not us ed in the class we followed. Finally, the ratings section lets stud ents rate the speed of the lecture as  X  X oo slow X ,  X  X ust about rig ht X  or  X  X oo fast X . The students can also rate the quality of the lectu re on a scale from one to six. The students have access to the sy stem through a website hosted by the university or can download it to their PDA. The system interface is illustrated in figure 1. We chose to study a large undergraduate class in co mputer science (enrolment 141), where ActiveClass was used . We hoped that since large classes typically have more limite d interaction between students and teachers [2], this class would benefit from ActiveClass. The class was an advanced class on com piler systems where part of the students X  work had to be carried out in groups outside the bi-weekly lectures. Early in each lectu re, the lecturer would ask the students to log into ActiveClass and use it  X  they had all been instructed during the first lecture ho w to log in. We observed the class for the last two thirds of the q uarter in each lecture, inquired to students X  use of ActiveClass a nd general classroom behavior through a questionnaire and inte rviews with eight of the students. Although only 31 of the stud ents returned the questionnaire, we believe that these can be use d to infer certain trends in technology consumption as well as the students X  motivation whether to use ActiveClass or not. The i nterviewed students were recruited after each lecture; by aski ng students directly, we hoped to decrease the self-selection b ias that occurs when participants have to volunteer. Naturally seve ral students declined  X  but most of the ones we asked were happy to participate. The interviewed students had an averag e age of 23.5 and two of the eight were female. In order to explore the premises for interactivity in the classroom, we first traced the trends of actual use of mobile technologies in our class. The students were not provided with any devices by the university, so despite having wireless access to bo th internet and ActiveClass, the condition for using this was that they supplied their own laptop or PDA with a wireless connection. Sixty eight percent of the respondents to the questionnaires ow ned a laptop with wireless access; however, classroom observatio n showed that only between thirteen and seventeen percent of the students had a laptop out and running during each lecture. Indeed many students chose not always to bring their laptops to class, w hich limited the use of ActiveClass. The interviews provided informa tion in this respect: students thought their laptops were too he avy to carry around all day and they worried that they would run out of battery at inconvenient times. This was also true for PDA u se; forty two percent of the respondents had PDAs, but only one w as observed in use in class. An additional obstacle to this, wh ich we observed, was the coordination that students would have to de al with in relation to their device. Because the classroom onl y had fold-up desks, space for laptops and notepads was very limi ted. Students therefore had to choose between their laptop and th eir notepad. The interviews confirmed this unavoidable choice an d two claimed that they would acquire a digital tablet, w hich affords better note-taking, when they could afford to buy o ne. But presently, they preferred their notepad to a laptop in-class. Finally, an observed obstacle to laptop use was in relation to the lecturing structure: approximately every second lec ture, the lecturer would pose a quiz, the result of which wou ld affect the final grade. This had to be done in class on paper, with every notepad, device and other potential aid removed fro m the desk. Although some students would start the lecture with their laptop out, the fact that they had to put them away during the quiz meant that they were reluctant to bring it out again. The observed number of devices at the end of quiz classes was th erefore generally lower than in non-quiz classes. Despite between fourteen and twenty two mobile netw orked devices being present in each class, very few stude nts actually logged into ActiveClass. Although they were encoura ged to log in at the beginning of each lecture, only between one and twelve students were observed online in ActiveClass each t ime, making the activity there fairly limited. The participatio n decreased through the quarter, although the observed number o f laptops remained fairly constant, see figure 2. In contrast to the Classroom Feedback System from University of Washington, ment ioned above, the teacher did not respond to questions pos ted immediately  X  because he could not see the question s himself. He would instead pause once in a while and ask the tea ching assistant if any questions had been posted. This meant that t he questions were sometimes related to material discussed ten mi nutes previously. This could point to one reason for limi ted satisfaction with ActiveClass among the students. Students are, despite often addressed as a homogeno us group, a diverse set of people with different behavioral pat terns. One of the challenges for the teacher is to ensure that all st udents have equal opportunity for learning despite their differences. Although research highlights how some students are intimidat ed in larger classes and reluctant to ask questions [1], not all students behave like this. Our observation showed that several stud ents asked questions or commented on the lecture material each class; however, it was typically the same students who int eracted, class after class. This diversity makes it difficult for the teacher to know if everyone follows the lecture and understands the material, because on the surface these eager students seem to understand or get their uncertainties clarified. Clearly, the mor e shy students would benefit from anonymity of a system such as Ac tiveClass, however, we found a complex situation where the shy students were shy online as well. One student describes her strategies when not understanding the lecture material: This student was too intimidated even to use Active Class as a medium through which to ask questions; her help-see king strategies were different from those of the more ea ger students who claimed that if they had a question they would just raise their hand. Some of the students mentioned that because o f the few laptops in class they worried that when asking a qu estion, the other students would be able to  X  X uestimate X  who it was. There was also a gulf between the eager students who said they would rather follow the lecture than monitor a system on their laptop and the more shy students who were found to be shy onli ne as well. This finding was similar to what the researchers us ing the CFS system at University of Washington found; sometimes , the students who indicated that they wanted more explan ation were not willing to speak up in class when asked to elab orate on the uncertainties they had indicated electronically. Ot her students were more enthusiastic about ActiveClass and liked the fact that it provided them with the option to ask the questions they were not comfortable asking in-class. As a student described a situation where he wanted to ask a question but did not have a laptop: He continued explaining that he would only say some thing in-class if he was  X  X ne hundred and fifty percent sure it was correct X , supporting our preconceptions about students being intimidated in large classes. Although ActiveClass requires the st udent to have a laptop (or one nearby as in this example), the grou p of students with the premises for interaction does not always o verlap with the group of students who need to use the technology. We observed that students tended to use laptops in class for web-surfing, writing projects and communication with pe ers. The questionnaires did confirm this as well; students w ith laptops in class did on average 1.6 different activities, such as surfing the internet, emailing or writing assignments, during a lecture. When comparing their laptop use to their self-reported l evel of attention, a difference emerges between attentive and less att entive students. Where 66 percent of the students with laptops out o n their desks reported that they pay close attention, only 50 per cent of the students without laptops reported paying close atte ntion. It was observed that more people with laptops had placed t hemselves in one of the ten back rows, an indication that they w anted to pay less attention in the lecture. Also, students who r eported in the questionnaire that they were not paying much attent ion in the lecture had often placed themselves in the back of the class. One student, for example, who was interviewed close to a project X  X  submission deadline, explained that he had to work on the project (for the class) and had therefore placed himself in one of the back rows with his laptop out throughout the lecture. He did not want to miss the class but admitted that he had paid lit tle attention to the lecture. He was indifferent to ActiveClass, say ing that he never used it  X  but thought it might be good for ot her students. 
Figure 2: The maximum number of laptops observed compared The students, who reported paying attention to the lecture, were also positive towards ActiveClass (indicating that it was good for the class and that ActiveClass should be implemente d in other classes). The students who used laptops in class bu t did not pay attention, on the other hand, were all less positiv e (responding that Active Class did not do much for the class). T his indicates that laptops in-class are used for very polarized t asks: either to assist the student to follow the class, or to engag e in a task unrelated to the class. The diverse behavior of students makes it difficult to implement a lecture supporting system such as Active Class and make it evenly beneficial for all students. Besides the fairly low level of students who currently have laptops and who regularly bring them to class, the students X  already inherent habits and classroom behavior, challenge the implementation of classroom technolog ies in unpredictable ways  X  ways which need to be addresse d. As we have seen, some students are negative towards new w ays of interaction and others are simply not interested, o r sufficiently confident to participate actively in class. The cha llenge is not just to make students use a new interactivity-facilitati ng system but also to question if it is desirable to change curre nt classroom behavior. In the case of ActiveClass it was clear t hat the teacher encouraging students to bring laptops led, to a cer tain degree, to inattentive students, few attempts to actually use ActiveClass and the  X  X hy X  students, the anticipated beneficiaries, were sometimes so shy that they could not benefit from it. Finally many students chose not to spend the physical effort required to bring their laptop to class and use ActiveClass. When students enter the classroom, they each have t heir own notion of how to behave there. Although they have a common understanding of which classroom activities are app ropriate, their background and social roles influence their behavio r. They are  X  X uned in X  to certain conduct, which they have lear ned throughout their previous education and their social roles aff ect their level of interaction.  X  X hy X  students are less likely to ask questions in class than outgoing students are but their learning patte rns are also different because they tend to seek help by other m eans than those offered in class. When introducing technology desig ned primarily to assist one particular group of students (in this case shy, introverted students), a polarization can occur bet ween those who feel they benefit from the technology and those who do not. Even though they are in no way obliged to use the system , those students who do not find it useful typically react negatively. The eager students X  perception of the technology is dif ferent from the others in that their presumptions of classroom lear ning are tied to high attention level and active student-teacher int eraction. While the heterogeneity of people is often seen as a disadvantage when implementing new technologies, we suggest that the technology focus on facilitating interaction for subgroups rather than aiming at complete demographic coverage. Inev itably, some will receive the new technology with a negative att itude or give up on it quickly; however, other groups will likely be more positive and use it to their advantage. It is important to b e aware of this heterogeneity as designer as well as a user and not force anyone into using an undesired new approach, such as those that the technologies we have examined provide. We suggest t hat classroom networks are used in parallel with tradit ional lecturing techniques in order to embrace the heterogeneity of students. Finally, the importance of the adoption rate of tec hnologies should be considered; in a classroom environment wh ere only few students have laptops, they become very visible to the other students and the teacher. Although as many as twent y-one laptops were observed in one class, the visibility of the l aptops can inhibit the use of a system which depends on anonymity. Cur rently, computing technologies in classrooms are common but not saturated. As the use of technology increases and p rovides attractive possibilities for classroom teaching, it becomes more appropriate to examine the process of implementatio n and diffusion that will inevitably occur.
