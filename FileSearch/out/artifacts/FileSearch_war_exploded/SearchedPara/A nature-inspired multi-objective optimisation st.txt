 Qian Zhang, Mahdi Mahfouf n 1. Introduction
In the steel industry, determining the optimal heat treatment regime and the required weight percentages for the chemical composites to obtain the desired mechanical properties of the steel is always a challenging multi-objective optimisation pro-blem. Usually, some objectives may conflict with each other, such Reduction of Area (ROA). In this paper, details relating to the optimal design of alloy steels are presented and discussed, which employs a salient nature-inspired optimisation technique, the Reduced Space Searching Algorithm (RSSA).

Inspired by natural and social behaviours, researchers have developed many successful optimisation algorithms. For example, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) ( Holland, 1975 ; Goldberg, 1989) the same way, a new search and optimisation algorithm, named in Zhang and Mahfouf (2007) , 1 which is inspired by the simple human experience when searching for an  X  X ptimal X  solution.
Compared with conventional optimisation techniques, such as hill climbing (gradient descent), Ne wton X  X  method and Quasi-Newton method, the proposed algorithm has the ability to tackle a wider also the more complex, uncertain and ill-defined problems. Unlike most of the evolutionary and social inspired algorithms, such as
Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimisation, which are population-based algorithms, the proposed algorithm does not rely to locate the final solutions. Furthermore, the most important difference between the proposed algorithm and other algorithms is the operation emphases within a search. Most of the optimisation algorithms concentrate on generating new solutions using various equations (derivative-related equations, PSO equations, etc.) or operators (mutation, recombination, etc.), while the new method concentrates on transforming the search space so as to find the and inspires people to think in a d ifferent way when facing such optimisation problems.

RSSA to optimise some well-known single-objective benchmark functions. A comparative stud y between RSSA and other three
Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 7. 2. Reduced Space Searching algorithm (RSSA) 2.1. Reduced Space Searching (RSS) strategy angle it would be legitimate to postulate that  X  X ommon X  sense should dictate that when searching for a candidate solution under reduced. This simple principle is being widely used in our every-strategy of constructing a new optimisation algorithm, named Reduced Space Searching (RSS) throughout, is proposed.
The  X  X ationale X  behind this RSS strategy is as follows: given an optimisation problem, one should divide the initial search space by the one with the lowest probability. The diagram of Fig. 1 illustrates the idea behind the RSS strategy. 2.2. Basic ideas behind RSSA
In order to develop an algorithm following the RSS strategy how to rank such parts in terms of priorities. In this work, a simple (but no simpler) method to achieve this purpose is be divided into two parts: one part being located around the best solution found so far while the other part should represent the space left. The partial space around the best solution should be top-ranked (the best). To simplify the method, the marginal partial space can be neglected and only the space that includes the best solution is kept for search purposes. If the process of dividing the search space into smaller parts is repeated a number of times, then a small search space as well as a relatively good solution to the problem will be obtained.

It was found that reducing the search space all the time is not the most effective way of locating the optimal solution. Some-convergence and at the same time will reduce the probability of the solution jumping out of the local optimum. Thus, a search space  X  X ncrease X  mechanism is proposed to cooperate with the original  X  X ecrease X  mechanism. In this new mechanism, if no better solution can be found in the optimisation search process, and should be decreased to reinforce the local search. If better solutions can always be found in a particular reduced space, then the algorithm may certainly have got trapped in a  X  X ocal optimum X  method attempts to strike a balance between the  X  X lobal X  and the  X  X ocal X  searches to make the optimisation search process more adaptive.

Fig. 2 shows an example of the size of the search space decreasing or increasing in a two-dimensional problem. In Fig. 2 (a), the rectangular Region 1 is the search space of an optimisation problem. Solution  X  X  X  is the best solution hitherto located. If there are several continuous randomly selected candidate solutions worse than  X  X  X  in the fitness to the optimisation problem, as is shown in Fig. 2 (b), then the size of the new space one should perform the search in. On the other hand, if there are several continuous randomly selected candidate then the size of the search space should be increased around the the centre, is set to the new space one should perform the search search space should not be changed and the centre of the search space (Region 4) will be moved to the new best solution  X  X  X .
In the light of the above considerations, a good solution is obtained after a finite number of iterations. However, it must be stressed that the above method may only find a local optimal multimodal fitness landscape, the RSS operator might lead to premature exit from the region where the global optimum actually belongs. To solve this problem and obtain the global optimal solution, a variation operator is employed to cooperate with the RSS operator. Fig. 3 shows the flow chart of the overall RSSA algorithm.

Three variation strategies are designed as follows: 1. One-dimensional variation : Only one element of the decision variable vector will be varied. The position of this element will be randomly chosen and the element will be set at a random value within the search bounds. 2. Multi-dimensional variation : The number of elements of the decision variable that will be varied and the positions of these elements will be randomly generated. These elements will then be set to some random values. 3. All-dimensional variation : All the elements of the decision variable vector will be randomly varied.
 The RSS strategy introduced above is based on the concept of multi-objective optimisation genetic algorithm was developed discrete grids and each candidate solution is mapped to one grid.
A neighbourhood is assigned to each solution based on its functional grid position. Then, a genetic recombination is only conducted between the solution and one of its neighbours. 2.3. The RSSA algorithm decision variables as follows: Minimise f ( X ), X A [ X min X max 1 ] [ X min 2 , X max 2 ] ? [ X min N , X max N ]. 1. Randomly select one candidate solution Xa ( x 1 , x 2 , 2. Randomly select the candidate solutions Xb (s) in the current located at the centre of the new space. Y min i is the lower bound of the i th decision variable in the new search space and
Y max i is the upper bound. To avoid the new bounds stepping outside the original constraints, the following equations are used to define the new bounds: Y min i  X  max  X  X min i ; Xbest  X  i  X  K n L  X  i  X  X  ;
Y max i  X  min  X  X max i ; Xbest  X  i  X  X  K n L  X  i  X  X  :  X  1  X  where i =1, 2, y N ;0 r n r m ; L ( i )= X max i X min i . m is a threshold value that depends on the precision needed and relates to the value of K .If K =0.5, a value of m =15 X 30 should prove adequate. For example, if m =20 and K =0.5, the search space can be reduced to as small as ( K ) m =(1/2) 20 ( E sub-space have a precision close to 1e 6 of its value range for a decision variable. 4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until n = m . o f ( Xbest ), then Xbest = Xc , n =0 and repeat Steps 2 X 4. 6. Repeat Step 5 until the  X  X ptimal X  solution is found or the termination criterion is reached.

It is worth noting that the decreasing parameter C 1 and the increasing parameter C 2 play important roles in the RSSA algorithm. They are used to balance the  X  X lobal X  search as well experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of C and C 2 general settings. It is generally recommended that C = C 2 ( D /2+8), where D is the dimension of the test problem. 3. Extension of RSSA to multi-objective optimisation problems
To extend the RSSA algorithm for optimising multi-objective problems, the Random Weighted Aggregation (RWA) technique (Murata et al., 1996 ) is employed and an archiving approach is also included to preserve the Pareto-optimal solutions. 3.1. The random weighted aggregation approach
Assume a multi-objective problem that consists of finding a vector X  X  X  x 1 ; x 2 ; x 3 ; ... ; x D  X  X  2  X  that will optimise the following vector function: f !
The Weighted Aggregation is one of the most common approaches for solving multi-objective problems. In this type of approach, all the objectives are summed to a weighted combina-tion as follows: F  X  where w i , i =1, 2, y , k , are non-negative weights.
In the Conventional Weighted Aggregation (CWA) method, the above weights are fixed during the optimisation process. By using CWA, only a single Pareto-optimal solution can be obtained in every optimisation run. If one wishes to obtain different Pareto solutions, the algorithm has to be repeated several times with the Pareto solutions when there are concave regions in the true Pareto front.

Random Weighted Aggregation (RWA) can overcome the limitations of CWA. In the RWA method, the weights are modified after every certain number of iterations during the optimisation. The weights are defined by the following equation: w  X  t  X  X  where t is the index of iteration and H is the frequency of the weight changing; rand i ( t ) is a function to create a uniformly distributed random value in the range [0, 1]; rem ( t , H )isa function to obtain the remainder from dividing t by H .
In this paper, the frequency parameter is calculated using the following equation: H  X  round  X  E max =  X  4 Obj  X  X  X  6  X  nearest integer, E max is the maximum function evaluation number which can control the objective weights to vary (4 n Obj ) times during the whole optimisation procedure.

As far as recently developed multi-objective optimisation tion-based and Pareto-dominance-based. Most of the algorithms are based on Pareto-dominance concept. They have demonstrated discovered that the Pareto-dominance-based algorithms may face some difficulties in solving the problems with a large number of objectives, because the emphasis of all non-dominated solutions keeping in the population may not produce enough selection pressure for the population to move towards the Pareto-optimal (Branke et al., 2004 ) out of all possible Pareto-solutions, the weighted-aggregation-based algorithms are more practical and relatively more straightforward. It is worth noting at this stage that the weighted aggregation strategy has been investigated further in other algorithms, such as the predator X  X rey approach weighted aggregation method to assign fitness values. To maintain weights when facing different  X  X redators X . 3.2. Archive design In the RWA method, the population cannot keep all the found Pareto solutions. Thus, an archive is used to record the Pareto solutions found so far during the optimisation search. To update the archive with appropriate Pareto solutions, a non-dominated selection and a diversity selection mechanism are employed. The non-dominated selection aims to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions from the candidates. This is easy to implement. The diversity selection tends to obtain the solutions with a good diversity from the candidates. In this paper, a simple method is proposed to achieve this purpose, which works as follows: 1. If the number of solutions in the present archive is more than the predefined maximum number, go to Step 2; else terminate this selection and return. 2. For every solution in the archive, calculate the value of its defined as follows: cri second closest neighbour. 3. Find the solution with the minimum criterion value and remove it from the archive. 4. Go to Step 1.
 archive is set to be 100. 3.3. Algorithm formulation
By applying the RWA method and by maintaining an archive for preserving the Pareto-optimal solutions, the RSSA is thus extended to a multi-objective optimisation algorithm, named as the Multi-Objective Reduced Space Searching Algorithm (MO-RSSA).
In summary, the entire MO-RSSA can be described via the following procedure: 1. Randomly generate the initial weights for the optimisation objectives. 2. Optimise the related problem, whose objective is the weighted sum of the multiple objectives, using RSSA for one iteration. 3. Add the present best position to the archive as the candidate solution. 4. Execute the non-dominated selection to the archive. 5. Execute the diversity selection to the archive. 6. Vary the weights of the objectives using the method RWA. 7. Repeat Steps 2 X 6 until a stopping criterion (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or a sufficiently good fitness value) is achieved. 4. Experimental studies using RSSA 4.1. Benchmark test functions
In the field of evolutionary computation, it is common to compare different algorithms using a large test set. When an algorithm is evaluated, one must look for the type of problems where its performance is good, in order to characterise the type test set with some well-characterised functions is used as it allows one to obtain and generalise the results regarding the kind of functions involved. All these functions are used as minimisation problems and the following shows their expressions and the summary of their features about separability and multimodality. 1. Sphere function (unimodal, separable and D -dimensional): f 1  X  x  X  X  2. Schwefel X  X  function 2.22 (unimodal, non-separable and
D -dimensional): 14. Goldstein-Price function (multimodal, non-separable and 4.2. Effects of the variation strategies
Three types of variation operators were tested and compared in this experiment. For this purpose, the 30-dimensional multi-modal benchmark problems f 5  X  f 11 were used as test beds. The decreasing parameter C 1 was set to be 23 and the increasing runs were conducted. In each run, the maximal function evaluation number was set to 10 6 and the optimisation process was regarded as successful and stopped, when the best solution minimum Gb =0 or 9 ( Fb  X  Gb )/ Gb 9 o 10 5 if Gb a 0.
From Table 1 , it can be seen that the one-dimensional variation strategy performs best on the functions f 5 , f 6 , f 7 , f while the all-dimensional variation strategy performs best on the problems f 9 . For a broad adaptation to various problems, it is recommended to use both the one-dimensional and multi-dimensional variation strategies simultaneously.
 4.3. A comparison between RSSA and other evolutionary algorithms
In this section, experiments were carried-out between RSSA and other three salient evolutionary algorithms, which are the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) Price, 1995) and the Generalised Generation Gap model with the Parent-Centric Recombination operator (G3+PCX) ( Deb et al., 2002a ).

The parameter settings for these algorithms are described as follows: the dimension of the test problem. The variation operator worked as a combination of the one-dimensional variation strategy (with the 50% probability of usage) and the multi-dimensional variation strategy (with the 50% probability of usage). 2. CMA-ES : There are 8 parameters to be predefined for this algorithm. All settings followed the instructions given in (Hansen, 2007 ). For instance, the population size l =4+ floor (3 ln D ), the parent number m = floor ( l /2), etc., nearest integer towards N . 3. DE : The DE/Rand/1 scheme was employed. The parameter settings followed the instructions in ( Storn, 1996). The population size N =10 D ; the crossover probability CR =0.9 and the weighting factor F =0.8. 4. G3+PCX : Following the papers by ( Deb et al., 2002a, 2002b;
Deb, 2005 ), the population size N =10 D ; the parent size was set to 3; the offspring size was set to 2 and the replacement size was set to 2. For the PCX operator, the distribution parameter s z =0.1 and s Z =0.1.
 The optimisation process was regarded as successful and stopped when the best solution Fb satisfied the following condition: Fb o 10 5 if the true global minimum Gb =0 or 9 the result was obtained after 20 runs. For each run, the maximal function evaluation number was set to 10 6 .

Table 2 shows the optimisation results of different algorithms on various problems. From this table, one can observe the following: 1. For the unimodal problems f 1  X  f 4 , CMA-ES performs best in most of the situations. RSSA performs best using the fewest function evaluation for f 1 . For f 3 , RSSA can achieve the minimum with a small function evaluation number, but it cannot obtain the optima of the problems f 2 and f 4 . 2. For the high-dimensional multimodal problems f 5  X  f 11 performs better than other algorithms. For instance, for f and f 10 , RSSA is able to locate the global optimum with the than the other algorithms. In most of the situations, RSSA can achieve the optima, while other algorithms often cannot find the  X  X rue X  optimal solutions. 3. For the low-dimensional multimodal problems f 12  X  f 14 able to obtain the global optimum and needs fewer function evaluations, compared with other algorithms. 5. Experimental studies using MO-RSSA
To validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-objective optimisation algorithm, a set of experimental tests were carried-out using the well-known multi-objective optimisation proble-ms  X  the ZDT series benchmark problems (Zitzler et al., 2000) and
DTLZ series problems ( Deb et al., 2001 ). 5.1. ZDT series benchmark problems
The ZDT series benchmark functions include 2 minimisation objectives and they are considered to be difficult to optimise, function evaluation for every experiment was set to 25,000, which is the same as the experiments configuration referred to the experiments in ( Deb et al., 2001 ). The configuration of the algorithm was set as follows: decreasing parameter C 1 =3, increasing parameter C 2 =1, changing ratio K =0.5, m =15, fre-quency parameter H =10000 and a variation strategy of the combination of the one-dimensional variation (with the 75% probability of usage) and the multi-dimensional variation (with the 25% probability of usage).

Fig. 4 shows the graphical results produced by MO-RSSA. The true optimal Pareto fronts of the problems are represented with a continuous  X  X ed X  curve and the  X  X ound X  dots are the solutions obtained using the new algorithm. It can be observed that the algorithm possesses very good convergence properties while maintaining a good diversity among the Pareto solutions.
Compared with the optimisation results in ( Deb et al., 2001 ), which used PAES ( Knowles and Corne, 2000 ), SPEA ( Zitzler and
Thiele, 1998) and NSGA-II ( Deb et al., 2002b), MO-RSSA performs as well as and sometimes better than the other three salient EAs in terms of both accuracy and diversity. 5.2. DTLZ series benchmark problems
DTLZ series problems ( Deb et al., 2001 ). All the DTLZ problems were set so as to include three objectives. For a meaningful comparison, MO-RSSA used the same numbers of function evaluations as the experiments in ( Deb et al., 2001 ). The parameters of the algorithm were set the same as the previous experiments, except the weight changing frequency parameter H , which is now taken to be 1000. Fig. 5 shows the 3-D Pareto fronts the algorithm can convergence to the real Pareto-optimal front with a good diversity among the solutions. Compared with the optimisation results in ( Deb et al., 2001 ), MO-RSSA performs as and NSGA-II, both in terms accuracy and diversity. 6. Applications in alloy steel design been applied to the design of alloys, including steels ( Mahfouf bulk metallic glasses ( Dulikravich et al., 2008 ), based on the developed intelligent models. Researchers have also employed design based on the interatomic potentials ( Chakraborti et al., work, the proposed algorithms, which perform very well on benchmark problems, were further applied to the optimal design time production X  of metals ( Mahfouf et al., 2009 ).
In the steel industry, determining the optimal heat treatment regime and the required weight percentages for the chemical composites to obtain the desired mechanical properties of the steel is always a challenging multi-objective optimisation pro-blem. Usually, some objectives may conflict with each other, such ductility can also be reflected by its Reduction of Area (ROA).
Previously published research included the development of intelligent models based on fuzzy systems in order to predict the of training data ( Zhang and Mahfouf, 2008 ). These models can be regime and the weight percentages for the chemical composites to obtain the desired mechanical properties. Fig. 6 shows the prediction results of one UTS model and one ROA model. These two models include the same 15 input variables, which are the weight percentages for the chemical composites, namely carbon (C), silica (Si), manganese (Mn), sulphur (S), chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), aluminium (Al) and vanadium (V), medium, as well as the hardening and tempering temperatures. They were developed based on 3760 and 3710 industrial data sets, are conducted using the two developed fuzzy models mentioned above. Fig. 7 shows the strategy how robust prediction models can recipes for system design.

In this case, the aim is to find the optimal solution for achieving a predefined target UTS value. The decision vector consists of weight percentages for the chemical composites, namely carbon (C), silica (Si), manganese (Mn), sulphur (S), chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), aluminium (Al) steel, the cooling medium, as well as the hardening and tempering temperatures.
 The objective function was designed to be as follows:

The average function evaluation number used in the RSSA algorithm is only 36.
From Table 3 , it can be seen that the differences between the 10 solutions are somewhat stark, which means that there are many possible solutions satisfying the same defined objective. 6.2. The optimal design of ROA case, the decision vector is the same as the one used for the UTS was designed as follows:
Minimise J 2  X  ROA ROA Target 60 where ROA Target is the target ROA value.
 the optimisation process. The average function evaluation number used in the RSSA algorithm is only 28. 6.3. The optimal design of both UTS and ROA a predefined target UTS value and a predefined target ROA value simultaneously. For this problem, one should first judge whether such requirements are possible. If the answer is  X  X es X , then the problem can be solved as a single-objective optimisation problem by combining these two objectives into a weighted sum formulation. However, if the answer is  X  X o X , then the problem should be solved using the multi-objective optimisation techni-que, which is able to offer a set of approximate candidate solutions (Pareto-optimal solutions). In order to ascertain both scenarios, the achievable minimum and maximum boundaries are needed. Such boundaries will, as a result, act as guide to the search for the Pareto fronts and as a result will speed up the optimisation search outcome.

In this section, the decision vector of these design problems consists of weight percentages of carbon (C), manganese (Mn), chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), and tempering tem-perature. 6.3.1. Boundaries for the UTS and ROA design
To obtain the mechanical property boundaries for alloy steels design, the multi-objective optimisation technique was em-ployed. Two distinct relevant multi-objective optimisation pro-blems were defined as follows:
The MO-RSSA algorithm was employed to optimise the above problems and the maximum function evaluations number was set to 10,000. The obtained Pareto fronts using MO-RSSA are displayed in Fig. 10 . The region between the two fronts is where one can design the properties (UTS and ROA). 6.3.2. The single-objective optimisation
If the target UTS and ROA are located between the design boundaries, then the single-objective optimisation technique can objective function: Minimise J 3  X  UTS UTS Target 900 ROA value.
 be seen from Fig. 10 that the targets are located between the Fitness 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 1200 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 ROA (%) design boundaries. Table 5 shows the results of applying RSSA to optimise Problem (12) for 10 different runs. The average number of function evaluations needed for these 10 runs is 133. 6.3.3. The multi-objective optimisation boundaries, then no precise solutions can be found to satisfy the desired targets. In this case, the multi-objective optimisation which are regarded as the possible candidate solutions. The design problem can be described as follows:
Objective 1 : Minimise J 1  X  UTS UTS Target 900
Objective 2 : Minimise J 2  X  ROA ROA Target 60 ROA value.
 and ROA Target is 50%, then from Fig. 10 it can be seen that the targets are beyond the lower design boundary. In this type of a situation, the multi-objective optimisation algorithm MO-RSSA should suitably be employed to optimise the above Problem (13) with a maximum function evaluations number being set to 10,000 for instance. The obtained Pareto-optimal solutions are shown in Fig. 11 and Table 6 provides details of 10 of these solutions. For those users who tend to prioritise  X  X ardness X  more, they could choose a design that is close to the target UTS. For those users who are more concerned with ductility, they may choose a design that is close to the target ROA. Finally, for those users who have no preference between hardness and ductility, a  X  X edian X  design, whereby the mechanical properties are relatively close to the target values, may be the suitable choice.

From the experimental results in this section, the following can be observed: 1. For an optimal design problem with two conflicting targets,
MO-RSSA is able to find the design boundaries, which is used to ascertain two different design scenarios.
RSSA can be used to obtain the desired precise solutions successfully. 550 600 650 700 750 800 850 900 950 1000 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 ROA (%)
MO-RSSA can be used to obtain a set of approximate candidate solutions (Pareto-optimal solutions) successfully. 6.4. The optimal alloy design considering both the mechanical properties and the economical factors
This study consists of finding the optimal chemical composi-tions and heat-treatment process parameters in order to obtain the required UTS and ROA while minimising the production costs. of energy consumption during the heat-treatment process.
In this experiment, five decision variables, C, Mn, Cr, Mo and tempering temperature, have been considered although other composites and temperatures could also be included. The factors contributing to the cost of heat treatment operation are summarised in Tables 7 and 8 (Mahfouf et al., 2002 ). 6.4.1. The optimal design considering both UTS and the cost
According to the contribution of the chemical composites and the tempering process to the cost of heat-treated steels, a new
J  X 
By taking into account such economic consideration, the problem of designing alloy steel with a predefined target UTS property becomes a two-objective optimisation problem de-scribed as follows:
Objective 1 : Minimise J 1  X  UTS UTS Target 900 Objective 2 : Minimise J cost  X  15  X 
Fig. 12 displays the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions in the objective space with the UTS target value UTS Target =900 (MPa).
Ten various solutions around the UTS target value are selected from the Pareto-optimal solutions and listed in Table 9 . 6.4.2. The optimal design considering both ROA and the cost
By considering both the ROA and the economical factors, the following two-objective optimisation problem can be set:
Objective 1 : Minimise J 2  X  ROA ROA Target 60 Objective 2 : Minimise J cost  X  16  X 
Fig. 13 shows the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions in the different solutions around the ROA target value are selected from the Pareto-optimal solutions and listed in Table 10 . 750 800 850 900 15 20 25 30 35 40 Cost (US$) 15 20 25 30 35 40
Cost (US$) 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5
Objective 3 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
Cost (US$) 6.4.3. The optimal design considering UTS, ROA and the cost
Taking into account all the three factors, i.e. UTS, ROA and the can be described as follows:
Objective 1 : Minimise J 1  X  UTS UTS Target 900 Objective 2 : Minimise J 2  X  ROA ROA Target 60 Objective 3 : Minimise J cost  X  17  X 
An optimisation experiment has been conducted based on the selected and listed in Table 11 .

From the above experiments, it can be seen that, for the optimal design problems that consider both the mechanical properties and the economical factors, MO-RSSA is able to obtain a set of optional solutions (Pareto-optimal solutions), which are close to the predefined UTS and/or ROA targets while providing various levels of heat treatment costs. 7. Conclusion
In this paper, a new optimisation algorithm RSSA was introduced, which is inspired from the simulation of the simple human societal behaviour when searching for optimal solutions in our daily routines. This new algorithm has been validated using a set of well-known benchmark problems. Compared with the recently developed and most salient optimisation algorithms, CMA-ES, DE and G3-PCX, RSSA performs as well as and sometimes better than these algorithms. RSSA was then extended to the multi-objective optimisation case, in which the random weighted aggregation was employed and an archive was maintained for preserving the suitable Pareto-optimal solutions. The experimen-tal results of optimising some challenging problems ZDT and DTLZ series problems show that the proposed MO-RSSA perform as well as the other well-known EAs, such as PAES, SPEA and NSGA-II.
Furthermore, RSSA and MO-RSSA have been successfully applied to single-objective and multi-objective optimal design of alloy steels. This research aims at determining the optimal heat treatment regime and the required weight percentages for the chemical composites to obtain the desired mechanical properties of steel such as UTS and ROA. In addition, the work was later with the composites and the tempering operation. The simulation results showed that MO-RSSA is able to produce a range of well-spread optional solutions around the property targets while maintaining reasonable production costs.
