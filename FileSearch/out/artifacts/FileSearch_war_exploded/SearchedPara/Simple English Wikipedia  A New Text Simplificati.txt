 The task of text simplification aims to reduce the complexity of text while maintaining the content (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997; Carroll et al., 1998; Feng, 2008). In this paper, we explore the sentence simplification problem: given a sentence, the goal is to produce an equivalent sentence where the vocabulary and sentence structure are simpler.
Text simplification has a number of important ap-plications. Simplification techniques can be used to make text resources available to a broader range of readers, including children, language learners, the elderly, the hearing impaired and people with apha-sia or cognitive disabilities (Carroll et al., 1998; Feng, 2008). As a preprocessing step, simplification can improve the performance of NLP tasks, includ-ing parsing, semantic role labeling, machine transla-tion and summarization (Miwa et al., 2010; Jonnala-gadda et al., 2009; Vickrey and Koller, 2008; Chan-drasekar and Srinivas, 1997). Finally, models for text simplification are similar to models for sentence compression; advances in simplification can bene-fit compression, which has applications in mobile devices, summarization and captioning (Knight and Marcu, 2002; McDonald, 2006; Galley and McKe-own, 2007; Nomoto, 2009; Cohn and Lapata, 2009).
One of the key challenges for text simplification is data availability. The small amount of simplifi-cation data currently available has prevented the ap-plication of data-driven techniques like those used in other text-to-text translation areas (Och and Ney, 2004; Chiang, 2010). Most prior techniques for text simplification have involved either hand-crafted rules (Vickrey and Koller, 2008; Feng, 2008) or learned within a very restricted rule space (Chan-drasekar and Srinivas, 1997).

We have generated a data set consisting of 137K aligned simplified/unsimplified sentence pairs by pairing documents, then sentences from English Wikipedia 1 with corresponding documents and sen-tences from Simple English Wikipedia 2 . Simple En-glish Wikipedia contains articles aimed at children and English language learners and contains similar content to English Wikipedia but with simpler vo-cabulary and grammar.

Figure 1 shows example sentence simplifications from the data set. Like machine translation and other text-to-text domains, text simplification involves the full range of transformation operations including deletion, rewording, reordering and insertion. Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia have both received some recent attention as a useful resource for text simplification and the related task of text compression. Yamangil and Nelken (2008) examine the history logs of English Wikipedia to learn sen-tence compression rules. Yatskar et al. (2010) learn a set of candidate phrase simplification rules based on edits identified in the revision histories of both Simple English Wikipedia and English Wikipedia. However, they only provide a list of the top phrasal simplifications and do not utilize them in an end-to-end simplification system. Finally, Napoles and Dredze (2010) provide an analysis of the differences between documents in English Wikipedia and Sim-ple English Wikipedia, though they do not view the data set as a parallel corpus.

Although the simplification problem shares some characteristics with the text compression problem, existing text compression data sets are small and contain a restricted set of possible transformations (often only deletion). Knight and Marcu (2002) in-troduced the Zipf-Davis corpus which contains 1K sentence pairs. Cohn and Lapata (2009) manually generated two parallel corpora from news stories to-taling 3K sentence pairs. Finally, Nomoto (2009) generated a data set based on RSS feeds containing 2K sentence pairs. We generated a parallel simplification corpus by aligning sentences between English Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia. We obtained complete copies of English Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia in May 2010. We first paired the articles by title, then removed all article pairs where either article: contained only a single line, was flagged as a stub, was flagged as a disambiguation page or was a meta-page about Wikipedia. After pairing and filter-ing, 10,588 aligned, content article pairs remained (a 90% reduction from the original 110K Simple En-glish Wikipedia articles). Throughout the rest of this paper we will refer to unsimplified text from English Wikipedia as normal and to the simplified version from Simple English Wikipedia as simple .

To generate aligned sentence pairs from the aligned document pairs we followed an approach similar to those utilized in previous monolingual alignment problems (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003; Nelken and Shieber, 2006). Paragraphs were iden-tified based on formatting information available in the articles. Each simple paragraph was then aligned to every normal paragraph where the TF-IDF, co-sine similarity was over a threshold or 0.5. We ini-tially investigated the paragraph clustering prepro-cessing step in (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003), but did not find a qualitative difference and opted for the simpler similarity-based alignment approach, which does not require manual annotation.
For each aligned paragraph pair (i.e. a simple paragraph and one or more normal paragraphs), we then used a dynamic programming approach to find that best global sentence alignment following Barzi-lay and Elhadad (2003). Specifically, given n nor-mal sentences to align to m simple sentences, we find a ( n, m ) using the following recurrence: where each line above corresponds to a sentence alignment operation: skip the simple sentence, skip the normal sentence, align one normal to one sim-ple, align one normal to two simple, align two nor-mal to one simple and align two normal to two sim-ple. sim ( i, j ) is the similarity between the i th nor-mal sentence and the j th simple sentence and was calculated using TF-IDF, cosine similarity. We set skip penalty = 0 . 0001 manually.

Barzilay and Elhadad (2003) further discourage aligning dissimilar sentences by including a  X  X is-match penalty X  in the similarity measure. Instead, we included a filtering step removing all sentence pairs with a normalized similarity below a threshold of 0.5. We found this approach to be more intuitive and allowed us to compare the effects of differing levels of similarity in the training set. Our choice of threshold is high enough to ensure that most align-ments are correct, but low enough to allow for vari-ation in the paired sentences. In the future, we hope to explore other similarity techniques that will pair sentences with even larger variation. From the 10K article pairs, we extracted 75K aligned paragraphs. From these, we extracted the final set of 137K aligned sentence pairs. To evaluate the quality of the aligned sentences, we asked two human evaluators to independently judge whether or not the aligned sentences were correctly aligned on a random sample of 100 sentence pairs. They then were asked to reach a consensus about correctness. 91/100 were identified as correct, though many of the remaining 9 also had some partial content over-lap. We also repeated the experiment using only those sentences with a similarity above 0.75 (rather than 0.50 in the original data). This reduced the number of pairs from 137K to 90K, but the eval-uators identified 98/100 as correct. The analysis throughout the rest of the section is for threshold of 0.5, though similar results were also seen for the threshold of 0.75.

Although the average simple article contained ap-proximately 40 sentences, we extracted an average of 14 aligned sentence pairs per article. Qualita-tively, it is rare to find a simple article that is a direct translation of the normal article, that is, a simple ar-ticle that was generated by only making sentence-level changes to the normal document. However, there is a strong relationship between the two data sets: 27% of our aligned sentences were identical between simple and normal. We left these identical sentence pairs in our data set since not all sentences need to be simplified and it is important for any sim-plification algorithm to be able to handle this case.
Much of the content without direct correspon-dence is removed during paragraph alignment. 65% of the simple paragraphs do not align to a normal paragraphs and are ignored. On top of this, within aligned paragraphs, there are a large number of sen-tences that do not align. Table 1 shows the propor-tion of the different sentence level alignment opera-tions in our data set. On both the simple and normal sides there are many sentences that do not align.
To better understand how sentences are trans-formed from normal to simple sentences we learned a word alignment using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003). Based on this word alignment, we calcu-lated the percentage of sentences that included: re-wordings  X  a normal word is changed to a different simple word, deletions  X  a normal word is deleted, reorderings  X  non-monotonic alignment, splits  X  a normal words is split into multiple simple words, and merges  X  multiple normal words are condensed to a single simple word.

Table 2 shows the percentage of each of these phe-nomena occurring in the sentence pairs. All of the different operations occur frequently in the data set with rewordings being particularly prevalent. To understand the usefulness of this data we ran preliminary experiments to learn a sentence-level simplification system. We view the problem of text simplification as an English-to-English transla-tion problem. Motivated by the importance of lex-ical changes, we used Moses, a phrase-based ma-chine translation system (Och and Ney, 2004). 3 We trained Moses on 124K pairs from the data set and the n-gram language model on the simple side of this data. We trained the hyper-parameters of the log-linear model on a 500 sentence pair development set.
We compared the trained system to a baseline of not doing any simplification (NONE). We evaluated the two approaches on a test set of 1300 sentence pairs. Since there is currently no standard for au-tomatically evaluating sentence simplification, we used three different automatic measures that have been used in related domains: BLEU, which has been used extensively in machine translation (Pap-ineni et al., 2002), and word-level F1 and simple string accuracy (SSA) which have been suggested for text compression (Clarke and Lapata, 2006). All three of these measures have been shown to correlate with human judgements in their respective domains.
Table 3 shows the results of our initial test. All differences are statistically significant at p = 0 . 01 , measured using bootstrap resampling with 100 sam-ples (Koehn, 2004). Although the baseline does well (recall that over a quarter of the sentence pairs in the data set are identical) the phrase-based approach does obtain a statistically significant improvement.
To understand the the limits of the phrase-based model for text simplification, we generated an n-best list of the 1000 most-likely simplifications for each test sentence. We then greedily picked the sim-plification from this n-best list that had the highest sentence-level BLEU score based on the test exam-ples, labeled Moses-Oracle in Table 3. The large difference between Moses and Moses-Oracle indi-cates possible room for improvement utilizing better parameter estimation or n-best list reranking tech-niques (Och et al., 2004; Ge and Mooney, 2006). We have described a new text simplification data set generated from aligning sentences in Simple English Wikipedia with sentences in English Wikipedia. The data set is orders of magnitude larger than any cur-rently available for text simplification or for the re-lated field of text compression and is publicly avail-able. 4 We provided preliminary text simplification results using Moses, a phrase-based translation sys-tem, and saw a statistically significant improvement of 0.005 BLEU over the baseline of no simplifica-tion and showed that further improvement of up to 0.034 BLEU may be possible based on the oracle results. In the future, we hope to explore alignment techniques more tailored to simplification as well as applications of this data to text simplification.
