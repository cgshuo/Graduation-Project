 Much of human activity defines an information context. We awaken, start work, and hold mee tings at roughly the same time every day, and retrieve the same information items (day planners, itineraries, schedules, agendas, reports, menus, web pages, etc.) for many of these activities. Information retrieval systems in general lack sensitivity to such recurrent context, requiring users to remember and re-enter search cues for objects regardless of how regularly or consistently the objects are used, and to develop ad-hoc storage strategies. We propose that in addition to semantic cues, information objects should also be indexed by tempor al and sensory cues, such as clock time and location, so that objects can be retrieved by external environmental context, in addition to any internal semantic content. Our cue-event-object (CEO) model uses a network representation to associ ate information objects with the times and conditions (location, weather, etc.) when they are typically used. Users can query the system to review their activities, revealing what they do at particular times, and which information objects tend to be most often used and when. The system can also pre-fetch items th at have proven useful in past similar situations. The CEO model is incremental, real-time, and dynamic, maintaining an accurate summary even as a user's information behaviour changes over time. Such environmentally-aware sy stems have applications in personal information management , mobile devices, and smart homes. As a memory prosth esis, the model can support autonomous living for the cognitively impaired. We present a comprehensive research age nda based on some promising preliminary findings.

Contextual retrieval, informa tion behaviour, sensor indexing, spreading activation networks, temporal indexing Semantic networks are a popular way to organize information and display its relationships. Nodes represent documents or other information objects, and often also represent attributes of the objects such as descriptive keywords. Links can represent many different types of relation such as is-a or has-component , but complex networks with many link types often need to be built manually due to their semantic subtlety [2]. By contrast, the task of building semantic networks from large corpora is too time-consuming to be done manually. The simplest automatically-constructed networks use just a single weighted link type that represents the degree of relate dness between objects. Relatedness can be calculated automatically using a similarity function to compare objects, and objects are retrieved through a traversal process such as spreading activation. [1, 3] The Cue-Event-Object (CEO) model is an online real-time system that automatically builds an in cremental representation of the typicality of recurring events. Its cues represent stimuli external to the system, such as time, location, temperature, velocity, luminance, etc. Events represent a particular type of occurrence, such as "going to the opera", and are linked to cues that indicate the circumstances of the event. An object is a datum linked to the event, such as "concert program" or "menu". A single event type may be linked to multiple cues and objects. Links grow stronger as events re-occur under repeat ed circumstances, to create emergent patterns. This enables su ch queries as "what do I usually do at time T ?", or "when do I usually do activity A?" The CEO model has been tested in a preliminary evaluation that uses a 6-month sequence of user behaviours to predict future actions. Using a very simple im plementation with basic time and location data, the model learned patterns quickly, and gave 83% accuracy of prediction. Further evaluation will measure the reliability of patterns, the ability to capture their "drift" as user behaviour changes, the effect of increasing the number of cues, and the model's utility with mobile sensors. Longitudinal studies will also be used. Thus we w ill show how external cues can complement standard semantic i ndexing to retrieve information objects under repeated conditions, such as at scheduled meetings, or en route to particular destin ations. The CEO model can be used to add context dependence to an y information system that is organized in terms of discrete information objects. [1] Belew, R.K. Adaptive Information Retrieval.
