 This paper investigat es subjects X  stopping be haviors and estimates of recall in an interactive info rmation retrieval (IIR) experiment. Subjects completed four recall-o riented search tasks and were asked to estimate how many of the relevant documents they believed they had found after each task. Subjects also responded to an interview question probing their reasons for stopping a search. Results show that most subjects believed they found about 51-60% of the relevant documents and that this estimate was correlated positively with number of documents saved and actual recall, even though subjects X  reca ll estimates were inaccurate. Reasons given for stopping search are also explored. H.1.2 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Models and Principles  X  User/Machine Systems  X  Human factors Human Factors Stopping behavior, recall estimates, user stud y, decision making Users make many decisions dur ing search, including decisions about which documents to examine and save, when to reformulate a query, and when to end a search. While researchers have focused a lot of attention on decisions that occur during the search process, relatively little atten tion has been spent understanding how users determine when to end a search, especially users who experiment. In our previous res earch with recall-oriented tasks, we observed subjects taking varying amounts of time to search for information about the same topics. Some subjects searched for longer time periods and saved many documents, while others only searched for a few minutes and saved few documents. Our observations lead us to ques tion how subjects in an IIR experiment decide when to stop searching. Understanding more about how subjects behave in an IIR study and how this compares to real-life behaviors is necessary in order to design more realistic studies and/or measures that account for potential differences. Brown, et al. [2] identified and te sted five cognitive stopping rules for information search. Brown, et al. found that the complexity of the task and users X  search experiences impacted which rules were used to trigger stopping. However, the tasks investigated were look-up and comparative shopping tasks and did not include high recall tasks. Furthermore, Brown, et al. was only concerned with cognitive stopping rules and did not investigate motivational or affective rules. Zach [5] conducted interviews with 12 arts administrators to better underst and their decisions to stop searching for information. Zach found that people often satisfice and stop when they feel what they have found is good enough. However, Zach X  X  study does not provide information about recall-oriented tasks or stopping behavior in IIR experiments. It seems reasonable to speculate that one reason subjects stop searching is because they feel they have found all (or most) of the relevant documents. However, it has been noted in previous research that people are not ab le to provide good estimates of recall [1]. In this study, we also examine subjects X  estimates of recall and the relationship betwee n these estimates and the length of time they spend searching, th e number of relevant documents they save and their actual recall. We analyzed data gathered during a controlled laboratory study with a single experimental IIR system. The search interface allowed subjects to query and review retrieved results, and presented query suggestions. Subjects were asked to find and save documents related to four a ssigned search topics. The topics and corpus were from the TREC Robust Track collection [4]. The Lemur IR toolkit and the KL-divergence retrieval model were used for the backend of the system. The main method and results of this study are presented elsewhere [3]. After completing each search task, subjects were asked to indicate what percentage of the relevant documents they believed they had found and to estimate the length of time they spent searching. At the end of the study during the exit interview, subjects were asked to describe how they decided to stop searching. Twenty-three undergraduate students participated in the study (16 females; 7 males), with a mean age of 21 years (SD=1.9). In most cases, subjects indicate d that they found about 51-60% of the relevant documents (Figure 1). There was a slight topic effect: for two topics both median and mode scores were 51-60%, for one topic the median and mode was 61-70% and for another topic the median score was 41-50% with multiple modes of 31-40%, 41-50% and 51-60%. Table 1 presents Pearson correlation coefficients that examined time taken to complete each search (actual and estimated by subjects), recall (actual and estimated by subjects) and number of documents saved. There were no significant correl ations between subjects X  estimates of recall and their estimates of time, or actual time taken. Since subjects were gi ven a specific period of time in which they could search, this likely prevented much variation in these measures. However, actual recall did correlate positively with time (actual time: r =.372 and estimated time: r =.327, p &lt;.01), so spending more time searching does seem to lead to better recall. Actual recall was correlated positively with number of documents saved, r =.553, p &lt;.01. There was also a positive correlation between subjects X  estimates of recall and the number of documents they saved, r =.395, p &lt;.01. The correlation between estimated recall and number of documents saved indicates that subjects are good at monitoring how many documents they save  X  higher recall estimates were associated with higher numbers of documents saved. However, this does not mean that their recall estimates were accurate. On average, recall was only .0735 (SD=.0437), so subjects X  estimate s are not accurate although their estimates do vary systematically with actual recall. Actual recall varied between .0000 (one subject did not save any documents for a topic) and .1959, while estimated recall varied between less than 10% all the way to 91-100%. 
Figure 1. Subjects X  estimates of the percentage of relevant Table 1. Correlations for actual and estimated time and recall, Figure 2 shows the reasons subj ects gave for stopping their searches (two subjects did not pr ovide any reason). The top three reasons were intuition, repetition of articles, and a decrease in relevant articles. While most subjects articulated rational reasons to stop their searches, many subjects decided to stop based on intuition. Intuition in this case is that which was unarticulated by subjects except to say that they  X  X elt X  they had  X  X nough X  and did not or could not articulate a rati onale for stopping. Subjects may have stopped their searches becaus e they  X  X elt X  they had saved enough documents based on their perception of how much of the 15-minutes had elapsed. Thus, s ubjects X  perceptions of elapsed time may have influenced th eir stopping. One subject, who actually monitored his own time, gave repetition of articles as the second reason for stopping his search. The repetition of articles and the decrease in the number of relevant articles was also a driving force to stop a directed search. One can postulate that the expended effort to continue a search for relevant and non-repetitive articles was not worth the effort or time under the current time constr aint of 15-minutes. Thus the subjects decided to stop their search because they had collected  X  X nough X  relevant articles. In this case, perceived tim e plus effort plus some results equals  X  X ood enough. X  Figure 2. Reasons given by subjects for stopping a search. Our findings relate to Brown, et al. X  X  [2] magnitude threshold (MT) heuristic which states that people stop searching when they have accumulated a certain pre-c onceived amount of information. In our study this threshold corresponds to the unarticulated intuitive notion of  X  X nough X  information. Combined with Figure 1, this suggests that this threshol d is the point at which subjects believe they have found more than half of the relevant documents that are available. Brown, et al. X  X  difference threshold (DT) states that people stop searching when they no longer learning new things. In our study this is evident in subjects noting repetition in articles or no new articles retrie ved. Lastly, Brown et al. defined representational stability (RS) as the point at which people X  X  mental models stop shifting. Subjects commented that they stopped when they noticed a decreas e in relevant ar ticles and an increase in non-relevant articles. Such comments might reflect that subjects X  mental models of the domai n were stabilizing. We investigated subjects X  es timates of recall and stopping behavior in an IIR experiment. We found subjects X  estimates of recall correlated positively with actual recall even though their recall estimates were not accura te. We also found that most subjects decided to stop searching based on an internal heuristic of enough information. [1] Blair, D. C., &amp; Maron, M. E. (1985). An evaluation of [2] Brown, G.
