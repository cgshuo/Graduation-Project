Recommender systems, human-com puter interaction, user experience, user interface, user studies, evaluation Since the emergence of recommender systems, a large majority of research has focused on objective accuracy criteria and less attention has been paid to how users interact with the system and the efficacy of interface designs from users' perspective. Well-designed user interfaces have the capability of enhancing user interaction experience and overall satisfaction. For example, explanation interfaces can increase user confidence in their decision choices and inspire user trust and loyalty to the used system. Nowadays, a variety of novel recommendation technologies have been developed to meet different needs (e.g., group and social recommenders). Recommender systems have also extended to new application platforms (e.g., mobile devices). In addition, heterogeneous info rmation resources have been incorporated into recommender systems (e.g., psychological factors, social media). This br ings forward new challenges in designing effective and efficient interfaces for these new recommender applications. As a half-day workshop, ACM RecSys X 12 first workshop on Interfaces for Recommender Systems (InterfaceRS) aimed to bring together researchers and practitioners around the topics of designing and evaluating novel intelligent interfaces for recommender systems in order to: (1) share research and techniques, including new desi gn technologies and evaluation methodologies (2) identify next key challenges in the area, and (3) identify emerging topics. This workshop aims at creating an interdisciplinary community with a focus on the interface design issues for recommender systems and promoting the collaboration opportunities between researchers and practitioners.
