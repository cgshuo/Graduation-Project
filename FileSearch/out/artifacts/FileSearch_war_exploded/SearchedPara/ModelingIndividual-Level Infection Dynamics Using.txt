 Epidemic monitoring systems engaged in accurate discovery of in-fected individuals enable better understanding of the dynamics of epidemics and thus may promote effective disease mitigation or prevention. Currently, infection discovery systems require either physical participation of potential patients or provision of infor-mation from hospitals and health-care services. While social me-dia has emerged as an increasingly important knowledge source that reflects multiple real world events, there is only a small litera-ture examining how social media information can be incorporated into computational epidemic models. In this paper, we demonstrate how social media information can be incorporated into and improve upon traditional techniques used to model the dynamics of infec-tious diseases. Using flu infection histories and social network data collected from 264 students in a college community, we identify social network signals that can aid identification of infected indi-viduals. Extending the traditional SIRS model, we introduce and illustrate the efficacy of an Online-Interaction-Aware Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (OIA-SIRS) model based on four social network signals for modeling infection dynamics. Empirical evaluations of our case study, flu infection within a college com-munity, reveal that the OIA-SIRS model is more accurate than the traditional model, and also closely tracks the real-world infection rates as reported by CDC ILINet and Google Flu Trend.

The unified goal of epidemiology is to mitigate and prevent in-fectious diseases from governing the population [24]. Having a system that accurately locates infected individuals when they are actually sick would tremendously aid in such an objective. For c  X  example, targeted care and treatment could be immediately imple-mented to students in a class, upon learning that one of the students is being contagious. Reversely, such a system could be used to val-idate the efficacy of vaccination and other disease control policies.
A brute-force solution for discovering sick individuals involves physically screening everyone for infection. Though such a method sounds promisingly accurate, it is not only diagnosis based, but also only applicable to small communities such as people inside a hos-pital. Diagnosis based methods would discourage sick individuals from participating, resulting in an underestimation of the real-world infection [2]. In larger communities where frequent mutual physi-cal activities allow the infectious diseases to spread such as schools or colleges, the costs incurred (both financial and time resources) by such a brute-force method would outweigh the benefits.
Online communities generate more than 2.5 quintillion ( 10 bytes of data each day [42, 5]. A large portion of this data is gener-ated through social media services such as Twitter , Facebook , and Google Plus that process anywhere between 12 terabytes ( 10 to 20 petabytes ( 10 15 ) of data each day [1]. These social media platforms allow their users to exchange information in a dynamic, seamless manner almost anywhere and anytime. Social media not only acts as a means of communication, but knowledge extracted from such large scale social media data has also proven valuable in a wide variety of applications. For example, real time analysis of Twitter data has been used to implement earthquake warning de-tection systems [31], identify medical and emergency needs during recovery from natural disasters (such as the Haiti Earthquake) [8], predict the financial market movement [7], identify notable product features [37, 39, 38, 36, 35], etc.

While social media information has been successfully used to predict real-world events, the uses of such information in disease epidemic purposes are limited. Though real-time disease tracking systems that extract disease-related information from social media have been proposed, all such systems track infection in a collective manner that only illustrates coarse-grain comparison of infections among different geographical regions and times [17, 11, 9, 21, 40, 20]. Employing social media signals to predict individual infec-tions is a new area of possibility that we aim to explore.
In communities such as schools and colleges, social networks not only bridge together individuals when face-to-face communication is impossible, but also become a major means of communication that is incorporated into daily routines. Multiple studies have found close ties between offline and online worlds, allowing interactions in the social networks to reflect those of the real world [23, 43]. If such an assumption holds, one could predict whether a person is being sick just by observing his/her social network activities. For example, Jack who is sick may stay home and post on his Facebook Timeline to let his friends know about his condition. Know-ing such, Jill sends a message to Jack offering her sympathy and her lecture notes when Jack is able to return to school. A few days later, when Jack gets better, he returns to school unknowingly that he is still contagious. Jill, who comes to contact with Jack in a class, is then infected and posts messages relating her symptoms on her Facebook. From this example, if we could build a system capable of predicting that Jack were still sick and Jill had a high risk of get-ting infected from him, then health specialists would be able to take actions to prevent Jack from spreading the disease and Jill would still be healthy.

Our research goal is to build a disease monitoring system that accurately and seamlessly identifies infected individuals. Though previous literature shows successes in using online content such as Google search logs [17], Twitter data [11], and Facebook data [41] to monitor real-world disease spreads, these systems report the in-fection in a collective manner (i.e. trends). Here, we analyze sur-vey responses from 264 Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) students regarding their history of having flu and their social me-dia usages, and investigate four types of social media signals that can be potentially useful for infection detection. These signals in-clude physical locations, disease-related content emission (e.g. sta-tus updates), disease-related content transmission (e.g., comments and messages), and changes in social network behaviors. We pro-pose the Online-Interaction-Aware SIRS (OIA-SIRS) that incorpo-rates these social network signals into a traditional Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) model [18], which simu-lates dynamics of an infectious disease in a contact network. A case study is conducted on a real-world Facebook social network to simulate the flu spread among Penn State students reveals that our proposed OIA-SIRS model is 56.78% more accurate than the traditional SIRS model at predicting individual infections. Finally, our model is able to resemble real-world flu infection as reported by the CDC ILINet 1 and Google Flu Trend 2 , which reaffirms that social network signals could be useful for our task.

This paper has the following key contributions: 1. We conducted a survey on 264 Penn State students to obtain 2. We investigate the possibility of using only information avail-3. We propose to model disease dynamics using social network 4. We evaluate the proposed model using empirical evaluations.
Vast research in computer and information sciences has devoted to collecting and interpreting informative signals from social net-works in order to predict real-world events. Literature on computa-tional epidemiology that relies on online data is extensive. Hence, only literature closely relevant to the problem at hand is discussed. http://www .cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm http://www.google.org/flutrends
Limited literature has been investigated on the relationship be-tween real-and virtual-world interactions. Liu et al. formally de-fined a new social network paradigm, event-based social network (EBSN), that captures the offline-online interactions in event-based social media services such as Meetup 3 [23]. Yin et al. later extended the work by investigating the tie between offline and online inter-actions, and found that the collective level of online interaction is independent with offline interaction. However, mutual friends X  ac-tivities (that can be observed online) may play a significant role in inducing offline activities [43]. These works illustrate initial steps towards studying offline-online interactions in event-based social media networks. However, their analysis is different from our problem in two aspects: 1) Their works aim at predictions in the aggregate level, while our model would make individual-level predictions. 2) Meetup explicitly advocates offline-online interac-tions by nature. The social media service used in our case study (i.e. Facebook) is not entirely event-based, but acts as an alternative for face-to-face communication. Hence, their models may not directly be applicable to our work due to the differences in the nature of these two social media services.
Diagnosis based disease detection involves physical diagnosing test subjects, and determining whether the subject has the disease. Multiple works have devoted on building predictive models that help physicians to determine the disease progression. Liu et al. pro-posed a Symptom-Diagnosis-Treatment system that collects het-erogeneous medical records to aid the clinical treatments of dia-betes mellitus [22]. The diabetes complication patterns are mined to build a prediction model that helps physicians to determine the diabetes progression given the patient X  X  symptoms. Boivin et al. built a prediction model for flu infection using a stepwise logistic regression, and revealed that cough and fever are the only symp-toms significantly associated with a positive PCR test for the flu [6]. Furthermore, Franklin et al. discovered that pulse pressure could be used to predict the risk of coronary heart disease [14]. Their method was shown superior than the traditional ones using systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.

Such diagnosis based methods, though accurate, could be inef-fective not only because sick individuals are discouraged from par-ticipating [2], but also due to financial and time constraints that make them only applicable on a small group of subjects. To mit-igate such issues, monitoring based alternatives exist that collect disease-related information without the awareness of test subjects. Davis et al. proposed the Collaborative Assessment and Recom-mendation Engine (CARE) which mines a patient X  X  medical history using ICD-9-CM 4 codes to predict the risk of future diseases. The method employs collaborative filtering to identify each patient X  X  greatest disease risks based on their own medical history and that of similar patients [12]. The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network ( ILINet ) collects information on patient vis-its to health care providers for influenza-like illness in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands, reporting more than 30 million patient visits each year [27]. ILINet provides information through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 5 , in the form of weekly influenza infection rates across all the geographical regions in the United States. http://www .meetup.com/ http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9cm.htm http://www.cdc.gov/
Aside from obtaining disease-related information from health-care providers, a number of studies have devoted to building non-invasive sensors to predict disease onsets. Galna et al. used the Mi-crosoft Kinect to detect the Parkinson X  X  disease patients from their movement patterns [16]. Semmlow and Rahalkar comprehensively reviewed the theoretical foundations and practical uses of acous-tic (sound) signals to detect chronic heart diseases [34]. Though these sensor based disease detection systems may seem ideal to our problem, the applicability to a larger community is still limited since such methods would require hardware installation that would make them bounded to be applicable in tight space (such as in a building, street, or hallway). On the contrary, the system the we aim to implement does not require additional hardware, but only uses already-available social network information to track disease spawns in a mass pool of social network users.
Literature has illustrated successful usage of large scale online data to predict corresponding real-world events, including epidemic and disease monitoring.

Google Flu Trend 6 successfully demonstrated the volume of flu-related search terms in Google search engine queries could be used to accurately detect the trends of flu infection [34]. Collier and Doan developed an automated text mining system that classifies Twitter messages into six syndromic categories in real time [11]. The classifiers are integrated into a disease surveillance system, DIZIE 7 , that shows a series of radial charts for each major world city with each band of the chart indicating the current level of alert for one of the six syndromes. Freifeld et al. developed HealthMap a global infectious disease monitoring through automated classifi-cation and visualization of internet media reports [15]. HealthMap harvests outbreak data from a variety of sources, including news media (e.g., Google News) and expert-curated accounts (e.g., ProMED Mail). Locations and disease types are detected from pieces of in-formation which are collectively visualized in a map-like interface. All such methods described above monitor disease spreads in a col-lective, coarse-grain manner; whereas our model aims to track dis-ease spreads in a fine-grain, person-to-person, manner.

The closest work to ours would be the fine-grain epidemic mod-eling work by Sadilek et al., which models individual flu infec-tion in Manhattan based on sickness-related Twitter messages [30]. Drawbacks of their work come in twofold. 1.) They assumed that a person who posts a sickness-related message would actually be sick. 2.) Even though their model aims to track disease passing from one individual to others, the evaluation was done in a collec-tive manner against Google Flu Trend. In our work, we show that sick individuals do not always announce their sickness in social networks. On the contrary, a majority of users may post sickness-related messages to send their concerns to their sick friends. In fact, all of our test subjects that indicated previous infection did not post anything regarding their sickness in their social networks. Such a previous model would miss sick individuals who do not ex-press their sickness in social networks, and would mistake healthy individuals who post sickness-related messages as being sick.
To better understand the nature of flu infection and social net-work behavior of a sample community, 264 Penn State students (ages range from 16-43) volunteered to participate in an online sur-http://www .google.org/flutrends http://born.nii.ac.jp/dizie http://www.healthmap.org/en/ vey that inquires the information about their history of flu infection and their permissions to access and collect their social network in-formation. The survey was conducted from February 2013 to July 2013.

Questions in the survey can be divided into 3 sets. The first set asks about background information such as gender, ages, and lo-cations. The second set of questions is intended to learn their flu infection history in the past year, including whether they had flu vaccines, what flu symptoms they have experienced, and when (in which months) they had flu infection. The final set of questions asks about their active social networks, including the permission to access and scrape their Facebook personal information in an anyn-omized manner.

The 264 participants include 95 male (35.98%), 134 female (50.76%), and 35 gender-undefined students (13.26%). 97.78% of the partic-ipants have indicated to be active on social networks. Out of these social network active participants, 92% and 58.67% of them have Facebook and Twitter accounts respectively. Figur e 1: Distribution of flu symptoms that the participants who had the flu experienced. Figur e 2: Distribution of monthly flu infections of the partic-ipants who had the flu: all participants (Blue) and those with Facebook information (Red). 36.64% of the participants indicate that they had a flu vaccine in the past year; while the other 63.36% did not. 75.32% of the par-ticipants indicated that they have experienced flu symptoms in the past year, 22.08% did not, and 2.60% were not sure if the anomalies they experienced were flu-related. Figure 1 illustrates the distribu-tion of flu symptoms that the participants who indicated that they had the flu have experienced in the past year. The predefined flu symptoms include fever, cough, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, muscle or body aches, headaches, and fatigue. Figure 2 shows the distribution of flu infections during September 2012 to April 2013. The blue bars represent the numbers from all the participants, while the red bars represent only the participants who agreed to provide their social network (Facebook) information (which will be used as ground truth to validate our models). Note that, though it might be a natural intuition that high infection rate should occur around January -March due to being the winter season where flu tends to spread, the distribution shown here does not resemble the natural flu infections. This is because the majority of participants (84.09%) took the survey during January -March 2013; hence, a high vol-ume of infection responses are expected to be inflated during these months.

This survey study not only provides us with flu-related informa-tion to be used as the ground truth validation data, but also urges the urgent needs for a better disease surveillance system that accurately locates sick population so that infection can be timely prevented. As the survey data illustrates, 75.32% of a random college popula-tion have experienced the influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms in the past year. This is a very high percentage that behooves disease control policies that should be adopted in such a community.
We propose to model the dynamics of infectious diseases us-ing only signals available in social networks. Such signals include actual geographic proximity between two persons, messages that convey sickness, and changes in online activities. These factors are incorporated into the traditional Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) model that simulates disease spreads in a con-tact network. This would allow us not only to investigate the possi-bility of building a fine-grain disease surveillance system on social networks, but also to illustrate whether these social network signals could be useful for predicting individual infections.

Since both the SIRS and OIA-SIRS models operate on a graph structure, from here on, graph notations will be used. A contact network  X  N, E  X  is a graph where each node n  X  N is a person, and each undirected edge e  X  E represents that the two persons come in physical contact. Let N  X  ( n ) be the neighbor nodes of the node n , and e ( n 1 , n 2 ) represents the edge linking the nodes n n respectively.

The next subsections will introduce the sickness-related message classification algorithm used in this research, describe the tradi-tional SIRS model, and discuss the proposed OIA-SIRS model.
Our model is built upon the ability to automatically identify sickness-relates content in user-generated textual messages in social net-works. Since we are dealing with millions of social media mes-sages, automated classification of sickness-related messages must be performed. Natural language processing techniques have been proposed to discover sickness-related content using both rule-based (i.e. keyword detection) [17, 4, 32] and learning-based methods [28, 40, 41]. In this work, we replicate and extend the ensemble health-related classification method proposed by Tuarob et al. [40, 41]. Their method is chosen due to being relatively easier to repli-cate and shown to work on Facebook data (which is our dataset).
In summary, the method extracts 5 feature sets from a short text message, including: Each feature set is used to train a base classier (i.e. SVM for NG, DC, and CB features. Random Forest for TD. RIPPER for the ST features). These base classifiers are then combined us-ing weighted average probability method with the weight vector  X 
N G = 0 . 1 , DC = 0 . 2 , T D = 0 . 1 , ST = 0 . 1 , CB = 0 . 5 suggested by [41], to make an ensemble decision.

Each base classifier is trained with 8,129 social media short text messages that are labelled either SICK (i.e. positive) and OTHER (i.e. negative), and uses 10 fold cross validation to fine-tune the probability threshold to maximize F1. A 10-fold cross evaluation was performed, yielding a precision of 83.65%, recall of 77.52%, and F1 of 80.45%. In this work, since we aim to find disease-specific messages, we add another layer of disease-specific key-words to filter in relevant messages. For example, to collect flu-related messages, general health-concern messages such as  X  X ealthy food is expensive!! Guess that X  X  why most of americas poverty stricken are overweight X  and non-flu symptoms such as  X  X tuck home post wrist surgery X  are discarded (even though they would be classified as positive by the classifier); while sick-related messages that contain flu-specific keywords (e.g.  X 530am been up all night coughing this is ridiculous X  and  X  X y body is so hot and glowing..Fever fever fever is killin me!I need a doc.. X  ) would be kept.
The traditional Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) has been widely used to study the spread of infectious disease in contact networks that can reoccur after the immunization wear off or a new species of the same disease is introduced. This assumption is valid for most virus-based diseases such as influenza [19]. The model assumes that a person in the network is in one of the three states at a given time: (S)usceptible, (I)nfected, and (R)ecovered.
At a given time period, a susceptible ( S ) node will become in-fected ( I ) with an infection probability of  X  = 1  X  e  X   X  is the disease transfer rate due to contact, and I is the number of immediate infected neighbor nodes. Once a node is infected, it will become recovered ( R ) with the probability  X  , also called the recov-ery rate . A recovered node will stay immune to the disease for the next T R periods of time before it becomes susceptible again.
We propose the OIA-SIRS model to show how diseases spread from one node to others using information available in social net-works only. In particular, we would like to investigate whether dis-ease infection can be traced using social network structures, along with observable social network information. The traditional SIRS model, described in Section 4.2, is modified to incorporate these signals. In particular, we modify the infection probability (i.e.  X  ) to also incorporate the proximity, sickness-related user-generated content, and changes in online activities into account.
The proximity signal concerns the actual distance between two nodes. Simply speaking, a susceptible node has a higher chance to get infected if it is located closer to an infected node. This is the case for most respiratory infectious diseases (especially the flu), where the disease carriers can travel through air [10]. Most social network providers such as Twitter and Facebook enable geoloca-tion tags when users post or comment, allowing the proximity sig-nals to be observed and incorporated into our model.
 Figur e 3: Example of geographical locations (red dots) of Penn State students, tracked by their Facebook Timeline posts dur-ing the week of December 10, 2012.

Social networks capture friend relationship which does not nec-essarily infer their physical contacts. Though it may be intuitive that friends have higher tendency to co-join activities (clubs, class-rooms, meals, etc.) which allow them to exchange diseases, such an assumption is still too generous to be conclusive. The proximity signals can mitigate this issue by allowing our model to pin point which nodes are actually physically together at a given time. Fig-ure 3 illustrates an example of geolocations of Penn State students that can be tracked from their social network activities. Note that the dots are aligned on the square grids due to accuracy truncating of the display software.

Incorporating the proximity signals, we define the proximity based infection probability ( P IP ( t ) ) at a given time t with the rate of  X  as:
I P ( t ) is the number of proximate infected neighbor nodes, and is defined as:
I P ( t ) = isInf ected ( i, t ) is a binary function that returns 1 if the node i is currently infected at time t , and 0 otherwise. distance ( n, i ) re-turns the physical distance between nodes n and i . CRIT _ DIST is the critical distance beyond which the proximity no longer takes effect. Generally speaking, P IP ( t ) quantifies the chance of get-ting infected based on how closed a node is to other infected nodes. In this work, CRIT _ DIST is set to be the diagonal of the place of interest (e.g. college campuses, villages, etc.). Figur e 4: Examples of social network emission messages in-clude status updates and Timeline posts.

Messages in social networks can be divided into two groups based on their purposes: emission and transmission . An emitted message is intended to broadcast information and does not require a designated recipient. Such messages include status updates and Timeline posts (Facebook).

From an observation, in a community where social networks be-come a prevalent means for communication (such as schools, col-leges, etc.), a majority of users tend to disseminate information on social networks when they cannot physically communicate face-to-face with others. Intuitively, infected individuals may not be able to be present at schools/work places, tempting them to emit such information on social networks (e.g., Figure 4). Such sickness-related emission could be a useful signal that indicates that the poster is being sick. We define the emission based infection proba-bility ( EIP ( t ) ), with the emission inference rate  X  , at a given time t as follows:
M E ( t ) is the number of sickness-related social media emissions that this node produces at time t .
While an emission message does not require a recipient, a trans-mission message is intended to transmit information from the sender to at least one receiver. Examples of such messages include com-ments on a post and tweets with designated recipients. A friend who has heard the news of sickness may be concerned and trans-mit a message to his/her sick friend (e.g., Figure 5). Such messages can be observed and are mostly available immediately. Hence, even Figur e 5: Examples of social network transmission messages include comments to a status update. though a person does not announce in the social network that he/she is sick, his/her friends may transmit concern messages that convey their friend X  X  sickness, which could potentially be used as a dis-ease infection indicator. We define the transmission based infection probability ( T IP ( t ) ) at a given time t as follows:
Where  X  is the emission inference rate. M T ( t ) is the number of sickness-related social media transmissions that this node receives at time t .
In communities where the use of social media is prevalent, en-gagement in social network activities is typically incorporated into daily, weekly, or even hour routines [29]. Oftentimes, sickness pre-vents infected individuals from performing such routines. For ex-ample, Jack who normally updates his status before his Tuesday and Thursday classes, suddenly stops doing so this week because he is sick at home. Similarly, Jill who is active in her social net-work suddenly decreases her engagement in online activities due to being occupied by sickness. The changes or irregularity in the usual patterns of social network engagement at time t is referred to as an online activity drift (  X  U ( t ) ), and is defined as:  X  U ( t ) = 0 . 5  X  | M ( t )  X  M ( t  X  7) |  X  U ( t ) is the equal weighted average of two drift components. The first drift component quantifies the deviation of social network activities with respect to the corresponding day of week in the pre-vious week. The second component compares the current online activity at time t with the average activity of the previous week. M ( t ) is the total number of user-produced messages (all the mes-sages emitted by or sent by this user) within the time period t , and M ( t ) = 1 7  X 
Our proposed OIA-SIRS model incorporates the four compo-nents described above into the traditional SIRS model by modi-fying the infection probability  X  to:  X   X  ( t ) =  X P IP ( t ) +  X EIP ( t ) +  X T IP ( t ) +  X   X  U ( t )
Where  X  +  X  +  X  +  X  = 1 , representing the weights of the individual components.  X  ,  X  , and  X  are computed so that R d  X  = 1 , R 0  X  d  X   X  1 , and R 0  X  d  X  = 1 respectively as suggested by [33]. d is the average network degree, and R basic reproduction number. R 0 &lt; 1 means that the infection will eventually fade away; while R 0 &gt; 1 indicates that the infection will be able to spread in the population. Though a previous study [33], that simulates a variant of SIRS model on social networks, used R 0 = 3 in their research to allow infection to amplify over time, so that effective targeted vaccination policies can be studied, here we use R 0 = 1 to allow long term steady rate of infection. In this work, an external activation factor is also added to the infection rate to allow 1% chance of getting infected from external infection sources outside the community. This factor is added to avoid the infections to die out, which is generally not true in real world.
It is important to note that we are simulating the spread of a generic ILI. While R 0 values for influenza are typically in the range of 2-3, we use a lower value with multiple reintroduction, which is arguably closer to the real ILI situation in a college town setting. Furthermore, while the assumption about moving to the susceptible state after recovery is not generally accurate for influenza, it is a good approximation when simulating ILIs, which can be caused by hundreds of different viruses that generally do not confer cross-immunity.
Influenza, commonly known as  X  X he flu X , is an infectious disease caused by the influenza virus. The most common symptoms in-clude: a high fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pains, headache, coughing, and feeling tired. Though common flu would only cause temporary malfunction of body systems, it can be fatal in some ex-treme cases. In 2009-2010, 105,700-395,600 deaths were reported to be caused by the flu [13]. Hence, the ability to automatically dis-cover potential infected individuals could prove to aid health prac-titioners to issue warnings to those who are in great risk of getting infected or quarantine those who are suspiciously infected. A case study of real-world Facebook network, comprising Penn State stu-dents, is used to demonstrate the efficacy of our models against the established baseline on modeling influenza spreads in social net-works.

In particular, we explore our research in college settings using the Facebook network for the following reasons: 1. Rich Social Media Engagement. College students are ac-2. Facebook College Network Resembles Community Struc-
Figur e 6: An illustration of the collected Facebook network. 113 survey participants (See Section 3) gave the permissions to collect their Facebook information, including their and their friends X  background information, friend lists, Timeline updates, and com-ments to those updates. We implemented a Facebook data crawler that automatically scrapes this information from each participant who gave an explicit permission. The crawler updates and col-lects new information everyday until the Access Token 9 expires (60 days). The resulting Facebook dataset comprises 1,348,800 Time-line statuses and 3,541,772 associated comments of 60,776 Face-book users. All identification was removed prior to storage. All the Facebook data will be destroyed upon acceptable progress of our research.

Figure 6 illustrates the Facebook network structure using the large-scale graph layout generation algorithm OpenORD [25]. The experiments are conducted against the baseline (traditional SIRS), to investigate whether the proposed online signals could be useful for identifying sick individuals in social networks. The goal of each simulation is to predict infected nodes at a given time pe-riod. The simulation is performed daily, and monthly predicted in-fected nodes are collected to compare with the ground-truth sick in-dividuals from the survey. The simulation starts from May 1, 2011 https://de velopers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens and finishes on May 31, 2013. The statistics are collected during the months of September 2012 to April 2013. Note that the simu-lation starts much sooner before we start collecting the statistics to allow the infection to stabilize. Each model is simulated 10 times, and the results are averaged. The simulations were conducted on a Linux machine with 16-core Intel Xenon E5630 (2.5 GHz) pro-cesser and 32 GB available RAM. Each simulation is driven by 15 threads that concurrently update equal subsets of the nodes.
Since the available ground truth data reports actually sick indi-viduals in each month, all the daily predicted infections are accu-mulated and compared with the ground truth data at the end of each month. Let N be the set of all the nodes, I ( m ) and I G sets of infected nodes and ground truth infected nodes during the month m . During the simulation, the following statistics are col-lected at the end of each month.
Since the number of available ground truth infected nodes vary month by month, weighted average scores of accuracy are com-puted that give more weight to the result of the month that has higher number of ground truth infected nodes. Let acc ( m ) and I ( m ) be the accuracy and the set of ground truth infected nodes associated with the month m  X  M , and M is the set of months where ground truth data is available (i.e. September 2012 -April 2013). The weighted average accuracy acc  X  is defined as:
In our OIA-SIRS model,  X  ,  X  , and  X  are computed to be 0.09899 ( R 0 = 1 and d = 2 . 02 ). The weight parameters  X  ,  X  ,  X  , and  X  are tuned to achieve maximum accuracy by comparing the re-sults from multiple values of  X  ,  X  ,  X  , and  X  . T R is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean of 120 days and standard devia-tion of 1, and with minimum 30 days, unless indicated otherwise. CRIT _ DIST is set to 1.60934 km, which is the diagonal length of the Penn State campus. A set of 60 nodes are randomly set to ini-tially infected. Each configuration is run 10 times, and the average accuracy is computed. The best performance in terms of accuracy is yielded by the configuration  X  = 0 . 2 ,  X  = 0 . 2 ,  X  = 0 . 1 , and  X  = 0 . 5 .
Table 1 lists the averaged monthly results produced by 10 repli-cations of the SIRS and OIA-SIRS models. According to the re-sults, our OIA-SIRS models are able to capture 35.66% of actual infected social network users; while the traditional SIRS model can only capture 24%. The weighted averaged adjusted accuracy of our OIA-SIRS model is 38.04%, which is 56.78% more accurate than the SIRS model which utilizes only network structure information. The standard deviations of the accuracy produced by the OIA-SIRS and SIRS models are on par (0.1602 vs. 0.1486), suggesting equal degrees of randomness during the simulations. The t-statistics com-puted by a 2-tail paired t-test between the adjusted accuracy of the two models is 0.026, suggesting that these two models are statisti-cally significantly different (with significance level 0.05).
The monthly infection ratios of the SIRS tend to be steady ev-ery month ( 0 . 12  X  1 , std. dev. = 0.006), this is because we set R 0 = 1 to maintain the steady infection rate in the long run. Hence, without external temporal knowledge, it is expected that the infection ratio would remain the same in every time period. Despite such, the monthly infection ratios of the OIA-SIRS model fluctuate with standard deviation of 0.03. This is because the OIA-SIRS model takes temporal social network signals into account, and hence would produce different rates of infections as reflected by sickness-related online activities during each time period. How-ever, the average infection ratios between the two models are the same (0.1215 vs. 0.1134), suggesting that the infection rates of the OIA-SIRS model are steady (i.e. do not explode nor fade away) in the long run.

The average simulation time (monthly) of the OIA-SIRS model (2,848 milliseconds) is larger than that of the SIRS model (595 mil-liseconds). This is because, the SIRS model only uses the network structure; while our OIA-SIRS model has to compute the distances and process messages when a node is updated. Figur e 7: Comparisons of the infection ratios produced by the SIRS and OIA-SIRS models, against the actual monthly infec-tion ratios reported by CDC and Google Flu Trend.
 Figure 7 compares the infection ratios produced by our OIA-SIRS model against the baseline SIRS model, the actual monthly ratios reported by CDC, and Google Flu Trend (secondary Y axis) during September 2012 -April 2013. Not surprisingly, Google Flu Trend exhibits very closely to the CDC rates. Since the SIRS model does not take temporal features into account (it only has the network structure which remains the same over time), the infec-tion ratios produced by such a model tend to be steady both in the short run and long run. Our proposed OIA-SIRS model, on the other hands, takes temporal social network information into ac-count, hence it is able to capture real-world flu infection as long as the users exhibit disease-related signals or anomalies in online activities. A notable correlated events occur during the month of December 2012 -March 2013, during which the winter season took place (hence higher infection rates due to the cold whether). The infection rates reported by our OIA-SIRS resemble closer to the actual real-world infection ratios reported by CDC ILINet and Google Flu Trend, as evident from the correlation efficient of 0.65, compared to correlation of 0.08 of the SIRS model. Figur e 8: Comparison of the accuracy achieved by the baseline SIRS, the OIA-SIRS, the proximity-only OIA-SIRS (  X  = 1 ), the emission-only OIA-SIRS (  X  = 1 ), the transmission-only OIA-SIRS (  X  = 1 ), and the activity drift only OIA-SIRS (  X  = 1 ).

In order to further investigate which social network signals play bigger roles than others in predicting individual infections, we gen-erate and run another 4 variants of OIA-SIRS models, each of which only uses one signal type. Figure 8 compares the monthly accuracy among these 4 models against the SIRS and the best OIA-SIRS models. Table 2 lists the average statistics. Recall that the best configuration for our dataset is  X  = 0 . 2 ,  X  = 0 . 2 ,  X  = 0 . 1 , and  X  = 0 . 5 . Agreeing with Figure 8, the accuracy of the OIA-SIRS is closely correlated with that produced by the Activity Drift Only OIA-SIRS, suggesting that changes in social network activity pat-terns could be the most important indicator for disease infection. Surprisingly, the accuracy produced by the proximity signals alone is very poor in all months, against the intuition that individuals who are in the same proximity are more likely to get infected. Af-ter investigating further, such poor accuracy may be caused by the Accuracy (%) InfRa"o limited geolocation information available in the dataset. Though Facebook enables geo-tag features, one has to explicitly attach a location every time a status is updated. This process can be cum-bersome, and encouraging Facebook users to skip this step and pro-ceed with a simple update. Furthermore, a majority of students en-gage in Facebook activities using the website interface that does not track geolocations.
The Facebook friend network was sampled from the 113 seed participants who gave the permissions to scrape their data. Though, surprisingly, the resulting network is all connected, it still exhibits a cluster-like structure (see Figure 6), where a cluster center is a sur-vey participant. This cluster-like network would be bias because the center of a cluster tends to have higher chance of infection than their neighbor nodes (due to having a higher degree than its neigh-bors). Furthermore, even though we are able to obtain the ground truth data that describes who actually were sick during September 2012 -April 2013, the data is specific to the monthly level (while the simulation is performed on daily basis). This could result in a biased, inflated accuracy. In order to strengthen the evaluation, we would need to know specific duration of illness of each participant. Regardless, the promising results of this research encourage us to start another data collection campaign where a participant would be asked to report their sickness in more precision in terms of both time of infection and detail.
The overarching goal of this research is to build a non-invasive disease monitoring system that accurately identifies the specific people who are sick, without explicitly diagnosing them. A suc-cessful system would not only enable targeted vaccination, but also serve as a building block towards multiple applications in epidemi-ology, such as disease discovery and studies of how diseases evolve from time to time. In this paper, we explored the use of social net-work to achieve such a task. We analyzed the survey results col-lected from 264 students and determined different signals that can be monitored through social networks that could help identifying sick individuals. We proposed OIA-SIRS, a modification of the traditional SIRS model, to illustrate the performance impacts from introducing such social network factors. As the results illustrated, by introducing such online-observable signals into the traditional SIRS model, we were able increase the performance in terms of accuracy by 56.78%. However, we are aware that the ground truth data may not be enough to be absolutely conclusive; yet the promis-ing results of our current work urge us to collect a larger set of samples that provides more precision and detail about sickness.
