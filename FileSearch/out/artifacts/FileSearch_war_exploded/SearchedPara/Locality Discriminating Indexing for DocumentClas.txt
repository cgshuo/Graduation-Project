 This paper introduces a locality discriminating indexing (LD -I) algorithm for document classification. Based on the hy-pothesis that samples from different classes reside in class-specific manifold structures, LDI seeks for a projection which best preserves the within-class local structures while sup-presses the between-class overlap. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method is able to derives compact discriminating document representations for classification.

Document representation and indexing is a fundamental problem for efficient classification, clustering, and retrieval. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [1] and Locality Preserving Indexing (LPI) [2] are two well-known document indexing methods in vector space model. LSI essentially extracts the most representative features for document representa-tion rather than the most discriminative features. LPI seeks a linear subspace which can preserve the local structure of data. Intuitively, the projection direction determined by LPI ensures that, if samples x i and x j are close, their pro-jections y i and y j are close as well. It possibly happens that two near samples belonging to different classes may also re-sult in close texts after the projection of LPI.

To address these problems, we proposes a Locality Dis-criminating Indexing (LDI) for document representation and sequent classification. We assume the documents reside on diverse class-specific manifold structures that overlap one another, and aims to linearly represent the document in a manner which discount the inter-class overlap. Therefore, LDI explicitly considers both the local structure and the prior class information. The novelty of the LDI algorithm comes from 1) the invader graph that effectively character-izes inter-class overlap of the class-specific manifolds; and 2) the locality discriminating criterion that defines the projec-tion vector to best preserve the within-class local structures while suppress the between-class overlap.
The document set is represented as a matrix X = [ x 1 , x . . . , x N ], x i  X  R m , where N is the number of samples and m is the feature dimension. The class label of the sample x i is assumed to be c i  X  { 1 , 2 , . . . , N c } , where N number of classes. Two graphs are introduced to construct class-specific manifolds. The k nearest-native graph , which is defined as a weighted graph G n = { V , S n } , with V = { x where the set N k ( x i ) , called k nearest-native neighbors of x , is composed of other k samples having the same label with x i and wished to be nearest to x i . Nearest-native graph consists of N c unconnected subgraphs, and each subgraph preserves the local structure of a class-specific manifold.
However, the class-specific manifold structures are usu-ally overlapped in the high-dimensional space. To effectively characterize the manifold overlap, the invader graph is intro-duced, which is denoted as a weighted graph G f = { V , S with V = { x i } N i =1 , where the set I k ( x i ) composes of the invaders of x i invaders of x i have two properties: 1) they reside in the local spherical space R m ( x i ) = { x : k x  X  x i k &lt;  X  the radius as  X  i = max are different from x i . Fig. 1 gives an illustration. Note that the invader graph is constructed by a  X  -neighborhood adaptive to the local density around x i , which circumvents the parameter  X  selection problem.

It is ideal to make each sample and its k -nearest neighbors always belong to the same class in the projected space and its invaders far apart. Based on this locality discriminating criterion, the optimal projection vector can be determined as follows: Figure 1: Schematic illustration of x i  X  X  k (= 3) nearest-native neighbors and two invaders before LDI projection (left) versus after projection (right). The numerator characterizes the intra-class compactness by the sum of the distance between each data and its k -nearest natives, while the denominator models the inter-class over-lap by the sum of distance between each data and its in-vaders. In equation (3), L n = D n  X  S n is the Laplacian [3] of the nearest-native graph G n , and D n is a diagonal matrix with D n ii = of the invader graph G f , and D f is a diagonal matrix with D
From above descriptions, the Locality Discriminating In-dexing (LDI) algorithm can be described as follows: 1. LSI projection. We first project the data set { x i } N 2. Constructing the k nearest-native and invader 3. Solving locality discriminating criterion in equa-4. Output the final linear transformation matrix . The low-dimensional representation using LDI is defined as follows: x  X  y = W T x . Experiments have been conducted on a subset of TREC ( TREC-5 &amp; TREC-6) corpus and a subset of Reuters-21578 collection. The subset of TREC corpus contains 757 docu-ments from 5 categories. The subset of Reuters-21578 has 1442 documents from 9 categories. Firstly, the documents are represented in the Vector Space Model using the nor-malized tf-idf weighting scheme [4] and subsequently trans-formed to the LSI, LPI, and LDI representations. The clas-sifier for all document indexing algorithms is k-NN ( k = 3). Figure 2: Comparative classification performance of the LSI, LPI, LDI and original representation with increasing reduced dimensionality.
 We compare the proposed algorithm to the LSI, LPI and the original representation for text classification. We evaluate these algorithms using F1 measure based on precison/recall across documents (micro-average). In all the experiments, the F1 values are estimated by 5-fold cross-validation. Fig.2 shows the classification results with increasing dimension of the document representation. It can be observed from Fig.2 that LDI clearly outperforms other algorithms. In particu-lar, LDI method achieves the highest micro-average F1 value when using only 7 features in TREC data.

In summary, we propose locality discriminating indexing for document classification based on graph framework. We take experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different document indexing methods. It is showed that the proposed algorithm derives discriminating features with low dimen-sionality and enhanced discrimination power.
