 Language exists in a natural continuum, both historical ly and geograp hically. The term language as opposed to dialect is only an expres sion of power and domi nance of one group/ideology over another. In the Arab world, politics (A rab nationalism) and rel igion (Is lam) are what shape the percep tion of the distinction between the Arabic language and an Arabic dialect . This power rel ationship is simi lar to others that exist between languages and their dialect s. However, the high degree of differen ce between standard Arab ic and its dialect s and the fact that standard Arab ic is not any Arab  X  X  native languag e sets the Arab ic linguistic situation apart . As such, the Arab ic language can be concei ved of as a collect ion of mu ltiple vari ants amo ng which Mo dern Standard Arab ic (M SA) has a special status as the formal written standard language of the med ia, cultur e and educat ion across the Arab world. The other variants are substantially differ fro m MSA and each other in terms of phonology, mo rphology, lexical choice and syntax. MS A is the official language of the Arab world. It is the primary language of the med ia and culture. MS A is syntact ical ly, mo rphological ly and phonological ly based on Classical Arab ic, the language of the Qur X  X n (Islam X  X  Holy Bo ok). Lexical ly, however, it is mu ch mo re mo dern. It is not a native language of any Arab s but is the language of educat ion across the Arab world. MSA is primari ly written not spoken.
 The Arabic dialect s, in contras t, are the true native language forms . They are general ly res tricted in use for informal daily commu nicat ion. They are not taught in schools or even standard ized although there is a rich popular dialect culture of folktales, songs, mo vies, and TV shows. Dialects are primari ly spoken not written. However this is quite changing since mo re Arab s are gaining acces s to elect ronic media of commu nication such as emai ls and newsgroups. Arab ic dialect s are loosely related to Classical Arab ic. They are the res ult of the interact ion between differen t ancient dialect s of Classical Arab ic and the indigenous languages that existed in today's Arab world together with influences fro m colonization and interact ion with neighboring countries. Fo r examp le, Algeri an Arab ic has a lot of influences fro m it's ancient indigenous la nguage Berb er as well as French due to the French occupation.
 Arabic dialect s vary on man y dimen sions  X  primari ly, geograp hy and social class. Geolinguistical ly, the Arab world can be divided in many differen t ways. The following is only one of man y: Lev antine Arabic includes the dialect s of Lebanon, Sy ria, Jordan, Pal estine and Israel . Gul f Arabic includes the dialect s of Kuwait, Sau di Arab ia, United Arab Emi rat es, Bah rai n, and Qatar. Iraq i and Omani Arab ic are included some times . Eg ypti an Arabic cove rs the dialect s of the Nile valley: Egypt and Su dan. North Afri can Arabic covers the dialect s of Mo rocco, Algeri a, Tunisia and Mau ritania. Libya is somet imes included. Yemenite Arabic is often considered its own class. Maltes e Arabic is not always conside red an Arabic dialect . It is the only Arab ic vari ant that is considered a separat e language and is written with Latin scri pt. So cially, it is commo n to distinguish three sub -dialect s within each dialect reg ion: city dwellers , peas ants/far mers and Bedouins . The three degrees are often associated with a class hierarch y in which rich settled city dwellers are on top and Bed ouins are on bottom. Diffe ren t social associations exist as commo n in man y other languages aro und the world. Fo r examp le, the city diale ct is considered less mark ed, better and smart er; whereas the Bed ouin dialect is considered lower class, rough, yet pure to the origin of the language. The rel ationship between MSA and the dialect in a specific region is rat her comp lex. Arabs do not thi nk of these two as separate languages. This part icular percep tion lead s to a special kind of coexistence between two forms of language that serv e differen t purposes. This kind of situation is what linguists term diglossia . Although the two vari ants have c lear domai ns of prev alence: formal written (MS A) versus inform al spoken (dialect ), there is a large gray are a in between and it is often filled with mi xing of the two forms .
 Fo r Natural Language Pro cessing (NLP), the existence of dialect s for any language constitutes a challenge in general since it adds another set of variation dimen sions fro m a known standard . The problem is part icularl y interes ting and challenging in Arabic and its diffe ren t dialect s, where the divers ion fro m the standard could, in some linguistic theories, warran t a classificat ion as a differen t language. This problem would not be as pronounced if standard Arab ic were to be a living language, however it is not. Any realistic and pract ical approach to proces sing Arabic will have to acco un t for dialect al usage since it is so pervasive. In this tutorial, we highlight differen t dialect al phenomen a. We discuss how dialect s mi grate fro m the standard and why they pose challenges to NLP. Our tutorial will have four differen t parts: First, we de scri be a back ground layout of issues for standard Arabic NLP. Then we discuss a high level generi c view of dialect s and their differen t aspect s that are of interes t for the NLP commu nity. We address both text and speech issues in addition to standard izat io n issues. We focus in depth on two aspect s of dialect processing in the third and fourth parts of the tutorial, namel y, dialect al mo rphology and dialectal syntact ic pars ing. Throughout the presentation we will mak e ref eren ces to the differen t resources ava ilable and draw contras tive links with standard Arabic and English. Mo reover, we will discuss annotation standard s as exemp lified in the Linguistic Data Co nsortium Arab ic Treeb ank. We will provide links to recen t publicat ions and available toolkits/res ourc es for all four sect ions.
 This tutorial is designed for comp uter scientists and linguists alike. No knowledge of Arabic is req uired . However, we recommen d taking a look at Nizar Habash X  X  Arabic NLP tutorial 1 which will be rev iewed in the first quart er of the tutorial. http://www.ccl s.columb ia.edu/cad im/ presentations.html
