 Social media has great potential as a means to enable civil protection and law enforcement agencies to more effectively tackle disasters and emergencies. However, there is cur-rently a lack of tools that enable civil protection agencies to easily make use of social media. The Emergency Analysis Identification and Management System (EAIMS) is a proto-type service that provides real-time detection of emergency events, related information finding and credibility analysis tools for use over social media during emergencies. This system exploits machine learning over data gathered from past emergencies and disasters to build effective models for identifying new events as they occur, tracking developments within those events and analyzing those developments for the purposes of enhancing the decision making processes of emergency response agencies.
Social networks and social media have become some of the most prominent technologies currently in use today. Indeed, the number of different social media platforms continues to grow, accompanied by a steady increase in the number of users that either actively post or otherwise consume con-tent shared using these platforms [5]. Furthermore, as these platforms continue to proliferate, the reach of these social networks and social media increases, particularly in rural areas where initial adoption was low.

Importantly, social media provide a wealth of real-time information, which, if used effectively can provide insights about what is happening in the world. In particular, during emergency situations such as natural disasters, information shared on social media has been shown to be valuable [19]. Indeed, experts in a variety of domains have developed tools to use social media to identify and track events [1, 12, 14, 16]. For instance, the Crisis Tracker system [16], uses a manually created set of search terms to crawl crisis-related content, which is then clustered automatically and manually anno-tated by volunteers. Such crisis tracking and analysis tools can collect, analyze and aggregate information from people channels. Using automatic tools to aid in crisis event identi -fication has the potential to enable faster response times to unexpected crisis events. Second, at a tactical level, we en-visage EAIMS being used by emergency analysts both dur-ing and after an event. Users can leverage the automatic tracking and analysis tools provided by EAIMS to more ef-fectively monitor the event itself -using social media users as sensors. Furthermore, these tools can also be used to assess how the agency X  X  response to the emergency is perceived -facilitating more informed communication with the public.
A broad overview of the EAIMS architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. As we can see from Figure 1, EAIMS is com-prised of three main architecture layers. The lowest layer is the crawling layer, which is responsible for collecting gen-eral, as well as event-specific social media content, which will be processed by the upper layers. The second architecture layer is the service layer. This layer is comprised of a se-ries of plug-and-play services that provide the end-user with crisis tracking and analysis capabilities. In line with the vision of EAIMS, these services are divided into strategic and tactical services. Strategic services provide functional-ity to users working at the strategic level, i.e. when tracking different event reports across multiple regions. Meanwhile, tactical services provide functionality when working at the level of a single event. The tactical services also include the Event Crawler Plug-in, which is responsible for performing targeted collection of content for a particular event. The third layer of EAIMS is the UI (user interface) layer. This layer is responsible for managing and visualizing the strate-gic and tactical information provided by the service layer to the user. In particular, this layer contains three main com-ponents. First, the event manager component is responsible for maintaining the list of candidate events that have been identified. Second, the UI layer contains the strategic UI, that visualizes the different candidate events that have been detected on a map for the user. Finally, the tactical UI is responsible for visualizing the outputs from each of the tacti-cal services for a selected event. We discuss the motivations and implementation of the tactical and strategic services/UI below.
The aim of the strategic services is to provide automatic detection and annotation of new candidate events to the user. To provide this functionality, there are two notable components that are needed: 1) automatic identification of events of interest to the user; and 2) association of those events with locations. The output of these components are visualized within EAIMS X  X  strategic UI, as illustrated in Fig-ure 2, where each event is represented by a pin on the map. Clicking on a pin displays the earliest tweet identified for the event on the right hand side of the UI. Additionally, a map overlay is displayed which provides event controls. In partic-and to switch to the tactical view for this event. We discuss how we tackle the event detection and location identification components below. on tracking terms (named entities and #hashtags) extracted from each event cluster.
 n amely: place information encoded within the tweet; geo-coordinate information for the small number of tweets that have them; and location(s) extracted from parsing the user profile for the tweet author. An evaluation of Carmen X  X  per-formance over a tweet dataset indicates that 22% of posts can be geo-located [6], although the granularity of the iden-tification varies (e.g. in many cases location can only be narrowed down to the country of interest). This is often sufficient to identify the location for one or more posts in our event clusters.
In contrast to the strategic services, which identify and visualize multiple events, the aim of the tactical services are to provide a series of tools to enable a deeper analysis of a single event. When a user initiates tracking of an event within the strategic UI, the cluster of social media posts for that event are sent to the Event Crawler Plug-in. This plug-in then formulates a new tracking query to collect content specifically for that event. To do so, it extracts all named entities and hashtags from the event cluster. These query terms are passed to the crawler layer as a query.
The tactical UI is illustrated in Figure 3. As we can see from Figure 3, event-related information is displayed along the top of the page (this can be customized by the user). Below the event information is a series of tabs that pro-vide access to the search, sentiment analysis and commu-nity identification functionalities (the search tab is selected in Figure 3). Down the right hand side, the output of the timeline generation service is displayed, showing the most recent updates automatically extracted from the social me-dia content stream. We discuss each of these components in more detail below.
The first of the tactical services is integrated search. This service provides dynamic indexing and retrieval of social me-dia content crawled for the event. This service enables in-formation exploration and discovery by emergency analysis staff during, as well as after the event. To provide social search capabilities, we build on top of the real-time index-ing and retrieval functionality of the Terrier search engine platform [7]. In particular, using Terrier v4.1, we deploy a real-time distributed index using a temporal document-partitioning scheme. Under this setup, multiple mini-indices are constructed, each containing documents from a partic-ular time period. For an emergency management scenario, this partitioning scheme has two major advantages. First, since many search requests will be time-orientated, we can

First, as a color-coded graph showing the sentiment polarity dis-tribution for the currently selected entity over time. Second, a listing of recent posts expressing sentiment about that en-tity. The user can add new entities to track at any time.
Emergency management agencies typically maintain a so-cial media presence as a communication channel with the general public. To make effective use of this channel, it is important to identify groups of stakeholders within the so-cial network that can be messaged, such as local response volunteers or news agencies covering the event. To sup-port this use-case, EAIMS provides an automatic commu-nity identification functionality. In particular, we use an approach based on topic modeling to identify communities as determined by the users X  interaction patterns within the social network. User communities are visualized within the community tab of the tactical UI, as shown in Figure 5. In particular, the user can switch between any of the commu-nities identified using the buttons displayed along the top of the UI. For the currently selected community, the top influ-encers are displayed, ranked by the number of social media connections they have within the network.
Finally, EAIMS provides a real-time timeline generation and notification functionality. In particular, the user can specify a series of information types to track, e.g. messages related to deaths or injuries. The timeline generation com-ponent monitors the social media content crawled for the event being tracked and extracts posts related to each of the specified information types to return to the user as up-dates. To achieve this, we build on recent works in the field of temporal summarization [8] to find relevant posts as they are crawled and then then apply explicit diversification with respect to the specified information types using the xQuAD framework [17]. In this way, we score a post based its rel-evance to the event, its coverage of information about the event, and its novelty with respect to specified information types. Posts that exceed a score threshold are displayed within the tactical UI as updates, as illustrated in Figure 3.
In this paper, we presented the Emergency Analysis Iden-tification and Management System (EAIMS), a prototype service that provides real-time detection, monitoring and
