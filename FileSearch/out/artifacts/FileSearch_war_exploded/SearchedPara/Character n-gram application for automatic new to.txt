Topic continuation: Staying on the same topic from one query to another within a single user session. N shift : The number of queries labeled as topic shifts by the proposed method. N contin : The number of queries labeled as topic continuation by the proposed method. N true shift : The number of queries labeled as topic shifts by the human expert.

 Some useful formulation related to the above notation is as follows: fitness function measure F  X _contin (Eq.

Cleaning the datasets process is the most essential element affecting the performance of the algorithms. them with space. 3.4. Character n-gram methodology ing n -gram pairs are given in Table 6 , with n values of 2, 3 and 4. number of n -grams. The similarity ratio can be calculated as follows:
According to the example in Table 5 , the similarity ratio of  X  X  X ybersc@n X  X  and X  X  X yberscan X  X  is 6 steps: A 0 :i =1.
 Repeat this step for the next query.

However, this change is acceptable given the improvements in the other performance parameters. more successful estimates. For the threshold value of 0.6, the character 3-grams yields F and 0.924 which are presented in bold, respectively; the neural network approach yields F 0.584 and 0.907, respectively . As a result, the F  X  ( shift ) ment in the F  X  ( contin ) parameter is also deemed acceptable. formance parameters. 5. Detailed analysis of the character n -gram method 5.1.
