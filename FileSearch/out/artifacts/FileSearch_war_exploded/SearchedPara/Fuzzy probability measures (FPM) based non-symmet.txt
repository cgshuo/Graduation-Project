 1. Introduction
Mining has an impact on the environment. Unfortunately, many former mining practices frequently have led to serious consequences. The impact of mining depends on many factors, in particular, the type of mining and the size of the operation. It can mean that land is disturbed, that the topography is changed and that the hydrogeological conditions are affected adversely. One of the most important impacts on the environment of mining is subsidence. Mine subsidence can be defined as movement of the ground surface as a result of readjustments of the overburden due to collapse or failure of underground mine workings. Surface subsidence features usually take the form of either sinkholes or troughs.

Increasing world demand for energy and mineral resources has resulted in much mechanization and rapid excavation techniques by modern mining operations ( Anon, 1975). Exploitation of minerals using caving methods such as the longwall mining method will result in surface subsidence. This phenomenon can cause environmental problems and damage to surface and subsurface structures ( Coulthard, 2001 ; Luo et al., 2002 ; Asadi, 2002, 2003 ; Asadi et al., 2004 ). In order to protect the environ-ment and structures from these damages, precise subsidence prediction is essential. When a horizontal seam is mined, the subsidence trough has symmetric shape, whereas in inclined seams it is non-symmetric and complicates the prediction of the surface subsidence profile ( Whittaker and Reddish, 1989 ; Asadi et al., 2004 ).

In some countries, large volumes of coal reserves of high quality are classified as inclined and steep strata. For economic reasons, these deposits have to be extracted and, consequently, the problems of surface subsidence of these types of deposits are still highly relevant. During the last decades, several new models of subsidence prediction for level, inclined, and steep seams have been developed worldwide ( Cui et al., 2000 ; Rodriguez and Torano, 2000; Toran  X  o et al., 2000 ; Donnelly et al., 2001; Asadi et al., 2004 ). Still, there are some complexities in the prediction of subsidence profiles in inclined and steep seam mining.

In this paper, a new method for prediction of the ground subsidence due to inclined seam mining is developed. The fuzzy probability measures (FPM) and non-symmetric membership function were applied in deriving the method. A case study is used to demonstrate the improved prediction method. The non-symmetric membership function and the mathematical theory of fuzzy probability measures are used to solve the problems of rock mass mechanics due to underground mining. The use of the theoretical of fuzzy mathematics to the evaluation of movements and deformations and to describe the basic feature of the ground surface due to underground mining, is a new concept, especially for the mining of in inclined and steep seam.
 below the surface and g is the limit angle. (It may be noted that some authors use the complement of the limit angle, often termed the  X  X  X ngle of major influence X  X .) This diameter also defines the critical width of the workings, which is the minimum width that needs to be mined before the maximum possible subsidence is observed at the center of the trough. If the mined width is less than critical, it is termed subcritical , and the amount of subsidence that occurs will be less than the maximum. If the vein being extracted is relatively flat and nearly horizontal, as is generally the case with coal and potash, the overburden and surface collapses or subsides forming a depression or trough. The surface area affected by mining is generally larger than the vein area excavated. Hence, the angle of inclination between the vertical at the edge of the workings and the point of zero vertical displacement at the edge of the trough is termed the limit angle or angle of draw. It is evident that the limit of surface subsidence depends upon the precision with which the subsidence is measured. By convention, this is taken to be the contour of points that have subsided vertically by 3 mm. It is also a function of the vein dip and the geology of the area.

Prediction methods ground subsidence due to underground mining can be classified into six categories: theoretical, profile function, influence function, graphical, physical, and numerical modelling ( Peng, 1992; Li Wenxiu, 1998). 2.2. Theoretical analysis method
Theoretical analysis methods , which are mainly established on continuum mechanics principles, try to explain a mechanism that can predict the magnitude of subsidence. To achieve this, many behavioral models for immediate roof and strata above it, such as elastic, plastic, visco-elastic, and elasto-plastic ones, have been selected to predict the surface subsidence. Szpetkowski (1972) presented a theoretical model based on the stochastic model for calculation of surface subsidence at point P( x , y ) when excavating an area having coordinates of a , b , c , and d as shown in Fig. 2 ,ata depth of H and thickness of m as S  X  am 4 p BH where a is the subsidence factor, symbols x and Z are coefficients of the working conditions, and B can be calculated from 1 ffiffiffiffiffiffi 2 B p  X  where k is a characteristic quantity of the overburden strata. 2.3. Profile function method
In the profile function method , a number of standard functions are defined to predict the magnitude of subsidence. Some of them are in the form of negative exponential functions and hyperbolic tangent functions. These functions contain some site-specific parameters that have to be selected very carefully according to site conditions. For this reason different standard functions have been suggested for different coalfields in America, England, Russia, Japan, and some other countries. This method can be used for square or other simple geometrical shapes of stopes. For example, tangent hyperbolic kinds of profile function that were proposed by Karmis et al. (1984) to predict subsidence in the Appalachian coalfield in USA in 1984 is S  X  x  X  X  S 0 2 1 tan cx B where S 0 is the maximum subsidence in the subsidence profile; x is horizontal distance from the origin, which is located at the center of the subsidence profile; B is distance from the influence that is 1.4 for subcritical and 1.8 for critical and supercritical panels in a monitored coalfield. 2.4. The influence function method
The influence function method is based on the effect of the extraction of infinitesimal elements of an area. Subsidence at any point on the surface is obtained from the sum of the influence of each extracted element. With the increasing distance, the effectiveness of an element decreases on subsidence and in a far enough distance its effect decreases to zero. This method can be used for prediction of subsidence in very different shaped extracted areas. Methods such as probability function and zone area fall into this category.

In 1957, Litwiniszyn presented a theoretical model based on the stochastic medium theory for calculation of surface sub-sidence due to underground excavation. The stochastic medium theory (SMT) method is based on probability considerations, and is well supported by field and experimental observations. This method has also been varified with the theory of stochastic rock movements. It is assumed that an underground excavation can be divided into infinitesimal excavation elements and that the ground movement induced by the excavation equals the sum of the movement due to each elemental excavation.

Fig. 3 shows an elemental excavation with dual coordinate coordinate ( x , z , Z ). The elemental excavation has dimensions of d x by d z by d Z , as shown. According to Liu (1993), based on the stochastic medium theory of Litwiniszyn (1957), the ground surface subsidence at a point ( x , y ) in the global coordinate system, s e ( x , y ), due to an elemental excavation can be expressed below: s  X  x ; y  X  X  in which r ( z ) is radius of influence, r ( z )=tan b ; b is angle of influence zone of ground subsidence.

For a long excavation with the excavation axis in y direction, the ground subsidence profile normal to y axis, s e ( x ), can be obtained by integrating d z along z axis. The resulting equation is as follows: s  X  x  X  X  c
P d y underground mining can be expressed as S  X  x  X  X  2.5. Graphical method graphical charts or nomographs, whereby subsidence magnitude and the associated parameters may be directly obtained for a specified set of mine parameters. This method is adaptable in areas where considerable subsidence data exist, and its applic-ability is generally restricted to relatively few, geologically similar regions. This technique has seen considerable use in the United
Kingdom ( Anon, 1975). 2.6. The physical method as sand and gelatin, a real model, but smaller than the extracted area, has been built. By precise monitoring and processing of data, the amount of subsidence in a real condition is calculated ( Asadi et al., 2004 ). An example of the physical model is given in Fig. 4 . 2.7. Numerical methods surface can be calculated by using finite elements, boundary elements, distinct elements, and finite difference methods.
Application of a computer for solving very complex equations in diverse initial and boundary conditions with different material behaviour made numerical methods more popular in the predic-tion of subsidence. In this regard, different software has been developed to consider inhomogeneous and anisotropic behaviour of rock mass worldwide ( Afsari, 1999).
 seam mining has been given by Alejano et al. (1999). The subsidence phenomena taking place when a flat coal seam is mined are analyzed in this section starting with the numerical modelling. The FDM based  X  X  X LAC-2D X  X  code, Version 3.22 has been selected to perform simulations. 3. The proposed new model strike and normal to the strike of the seam passing through the point of maximum surface subsidence are called the principal cross-sections of the subsidence trough. In this paper, all of the subsidence profiles are along the major sections. If the ore seam is horizontal then the surface subsidence profile has a symmetric shape in section. However, it is non-symmetric, if the ore-seam is inclined, as shown in Fig. 5 a.
 in a body of rock because of the complexity of the problem (There are many factors affecting mine subsidence, such as seam thickness , seam depth , dip of seam , degree of extraction and so on). Instead, various approximate methods have been used for this calculation. In recent years, in mining engineering in particular, theory of fuzzy mathematics has been applied to analyze the problems of ground surface movement due to underground mining ( Li Wenxiu, 1998).
 can be regarded as a fuzzy event because of the complexity of factors affecting the movement. In other words, this movement will take place at a fuzzy probability, and so the theory of fuzzy probability measures can be applied to describe ground surface movement ( Li Wenxiu, 1998).
 by the present author. The new model is considered for prediction of the surface subsidence profile due to inclined ore-seams with regard to longwall mining. The model is based on the fuzzy probability and non-symmetric membership function of fuzzy mathematics and has been used for analyzing the ground subsidence due to underground excavation and the formulas derived from the theory have been successfully applied to the engineering problems in mining. This method has the advantage of being simple to calculate over the above conventional methods. 3.1. Factors affecting ground subsidence due to underground mining seam thickness , seam depth , dip of seam , degree of extraction and so on. Several geologic and mining parameters and the nature of the structure affect the magnitude and extent of subsidence that occur due to ore mining ( Henry, 1956 ; King and Whetton, 1957 ; Sinclair, 1963; Cortis, 1969; Brauner, 1973 ). 3.1.1. Mining depth and dip of ore body
Instability caused by mining reaches the surface through the overburden, and the depth affects the velocity and period of the surface movements. When mining depth is smaller than 50 m, surface movements last for 2 X 3 months only, if it is between 500 and 600 m, surface movements may last for 2 X 3 years. The total amount of subsidence does not appear to be changed; that is, subsidence amount is independent of depth ( Orchard, 1964 in Singh, 1992 ). A school of thought exists that at greater depths, an arch is formed over the mine cavity, preventing surface sub-sidence. In recent years, this has been gradually refuted. Perhaps the time period that elapses before subsidence effects are observed at the surface is prolonged, but the total amount of subsidence does not appear to be changed; that is, subsidence is independent of depth ( Orchard, 1964).

When the ore seam being mined is inclined, an asymmetric subsidence trough is formed that is skewed toward the rise; that is, the limit angle is greater on the dip side of the workings. The strains are also smaller toward the dip direction. Pillars in steeply dipping seams tend to be less stable. According to the examina-tion in the north Staffordshire coalfields of UK, the maximum subsidence point is located by intersecting the normal of the center of the longwall extraction with the surface. Seam gradient not only shifts the individual subsidence trough to the dip side but also causes asymmetry of the trough. The boundaries of the trough are defined by two different influence angles for the rise and dip. On the longitudinal cross-section, the trough is symmetrical to the vertical with the influence angle being the same for a level seam extraction ( Lin et al., 1992 ). 3.1.2. Mining method
The type of initial subsidence experienced, namely pit or trough, depends on whether room and pillar or longwall mining is being practiced. With room and pillar mining, the eventual collapse of pillars may lead to trenching or sagging of the surface. The displacements and strains over short distances, when they start appearing on the surface, are significant. Nearly immediate but predictable subsidence occurs with longwall mining. Harmonic mining, either by working adjacent longwalls in the same seam or superposed panels in different seams, can be effectively utilized to neutralize compressive and tensile strains and thereby protect surface structures. However, the method is not readily applied and is restricted for use only where mining costs become subservient to historical or social demands. The caving method causes most severe movement, and the fractured zone heights are largest. Subsidence is about 70 X 95% of the excavation thickness since immediate layers increase in bulk as they break up. The first segment of the roof collapses when the excavation length reaches 10 X 50 m. It is an advantage of this method that the overburden movement and damage will be completed and the gob will be compacted and 24 restabilized in a limited time period. Therefore, in the future there will not be subsequent major movements.

In addition, partial or complete backfilling of the gob reduces, but does not eliminate, subsidence. The amount of subsidence that occurs depends upon the type and extent of backfilling adopted. Thus, for example, hand packing is not as good as pneumatic stowing or hydraulic backfilling. 3.1.3. Ore body (seam) thickness
The thicker the seam extracted, the larger the amount of surface subsidence that is possible. Subsidence will increase with mined-out area mined-out area increasing extraction thickness. Effected seam thickness (there may be pillars or unmined parts of coal) should be considered for the subsidence estimation. Slender (high height to width ratio) pillars are more close to failure. The full subsidence at the center is a linear function of the mining height. In some cases, the entire seam may not be mined or some pillars or other non-minable ore may be left in place. Hence, the effective seam thickness should be considered. In thick beds, the slenderness (height-to-width ratio) of the pillars is higher for a given extraction ratio. Slender pillars are normally more prone to failure. Moreover, where multiple worked-out mining horizons exist, collapse could be initiated from any one of several levels, thereby increasing the likelihood of subsidence events, because the adjacent strata are disturbed. This is especially true when the prior mining was in an overlying seam. In addition, The likelihood of subsidence events increase because of the distur-bance of the adjacent strata in a case of multiple worked-out mining horizons. Maximum slopes in a subsidence trough generally range between 0.002 and 0.02, but may reach 0.15 for multiple seam extraction ( Singh, 1992). 3.1.4. Properties of overlying strata the magnitude and limits of subsidence. Height of overburden movement is affected by rock properties and stratigraphic sequence. Hard and brittle strata are more likely to produce cracks and fractures than the soft and plastic strata. Fractures in the soft and plastic strata will close up with time, thereby slightly reducing the fractured zone height. In the hard/strong and medium hard/strong strata, the fractured zone height ones formed does not show any conspicuous changes with time ( Peng, 1992).
 cteristics of the mine roof and floor are vital in the initiation of subsidence movements. Soft fireclay floors, especially if susceptible to further weakening due to moisture, induce pillar punching or heave. Weak roofs, composed of shales, siltstones, and limestones, permit falls that are accentuated if punching also occurs. Competent roof beds tend to support the overlying strata longer and hence delay the subsidence. Also, when these fracture, they occupy a greater bulk volume than weaker strata. When both the roof and floor are strong, the pillars tend to spall and crush.
Strong massive beds above the mine level tend to prop the overburden for a prolonged period and defer the occurrence of subsidence. 3.1.5. Near-surface geology accentuate subsidence effects. The geologic materials are less homogeneous and isotropic than the underlying strata, and often behave in an inconsistent manner. Cracks and fissures may initially form in a 50 ft (15 m) thick layer from the surface. Later, these may be filled by plastic deformation or material transporta-tion by water. Occasionally, however, water flow may accentuate these fissures and form gullies. Structures and renewable resource lands are thereby adversely affected.
 material is of a fine, sandy nature containing large amounts of water, it may flow to a rock fracture and drop into the underground workings. Besides, water accumulating in the abandoned mine may seep upwards into the unconsolidated strata above through natural fissures and cracks in the rock and increase the potential for soil collapse. 3.1.6. Geologic discontinuities subsidence potential. Mining disturbs the equilibrium of forces in the strata and may trigger movement along a fault plane, due to ease of slippage, causing either settlement or upthrust at the surface, which may appear as a series of step fractures. The effects of the other parameters may need to be discounted in areas of adverse geological conditions. Lateral movements concentrate near the fault, but the strains may become immeasurable on either side. Structures that straddle fault planes tend to be severely damaged, but nearby buildings remain relatively intact.
Joints and fissures in the strata affect subsidence behaviour in a manner similar to faults but on a smaller scale. 3.1.7. Effects of in situ stresses forming a ground arch in the immediate mine roof ( Lee and Abel, 1983). The arch height and stability are sensitive to the ratio of vertical to horizontal stresses. Highly stressed arches may fail violently (e.g., the Urad molybdenum mine, Colorado). Roof instability and floor heave, resulting from high horizontal stresses and their orientation, need to be taken into account when laying out coal mines in the Allegheny Plateau ( Aggson, 1978 ). 3.1.8. Effects of degree of underground mining prevalent in areas superjacent to first mining, since sufficient pillar support is generally available without crushing of pillars. In second mining, the cross-section of the pillars is reduced by splitting and slicing. Localized stress buildups promote crushing, and excessively wide roof areas exposed between pillars stimu-late roof failure. Third mining is almost invariably followed by roof collapse in the workings. Surface manifestations are a function of time, dependent on the rate of upward propagation of settlement. 3.1.9. Effects of surface topography in valleys ( Singh, 1992 ). Significant fissuring can occur at the steep hillsides and substantial fissuring can introduce slope stability problems. As may be anticipated, sloping ground tends to emphasize downward movements because of gravity. Tensile strains may become more marked on hilltops and decrease in valleys. Surface effects are influenced accordingly. 3.1.10. Effects of groundwater water table can result in appreciable subsidence. Drainage gradients, patterns and groundwater flow may change because of opening or closing of bedrock fissures. Localized erosion features can occur at the surface above such bedrock fissures.
Li Wenxiu (1998) introduced the Interbed Drainage Package, which has been developed for the MODFLOW model, allowing the calculation of land subsidence due to the extraction of ground-water. Deformation of the strata around mined areas may alter drainage gradients, resulting in the formation of surface or underground reservoirs (in aquifers). Low-lying areas, such as in central Illinois, may become flooded. Rocks may be weakened by saturation. Erosion patterns could change, and in limestone areas, caverns or karst areas may be created over a period of time.
Where surface runoffs from precipitation or water from leaky mains are allowed to accumulate, water may percolate down through the soil to the fractures and fissures in the bedrock, and finally into the mine openings. The erosion and lubrication effects induce failure. Water reduces the strength and stiffness of pillars and the roof and floor markedly. Periodic changes in mine humidity promote deterioration of all these members. Floor softening permits punching, resulting in instability and subsi-dence. Flow through fissures cause seepage pressures, endanger-ing the stability of the rock mass. Cleavage and bedding planes are lubricated by water, inducing movements. 3.1.11. Effects of mined area and rate of face advance
The critical width needs to be exceeded along both the lateral and longitudinal axes to achieve maximum subsidence. This is especially important if competent strata present in the over-burden tend to bridge across the panel and decrease subsidence when the panel width is less than the critical width, even though the length of the panel is greater. In addition, surface subsidence follows the face as it progresses in the panel. If the ore body extraction rate varies markedly, the traveling strains also fluctuate. This results in large differential settlements. A fairly rapid, even rate of face advance is best ( Legget, 1972). 3.1.12. Time elapse
As is well known, the amount of subsidence observed is a function of time. In room and pillar operations, no surface effects may be noted for some time after the mining is complete until the pillars deteriorate or punch into the floor. In longwall mines, the surface may start sagging almost immediately after the face passes below an area. However, the occurrence of massive beds in the overburden could delay this. With longwalls, surface movements are complete within a few years, but when pillars are left intact for support, this may take decades. Room and pillar mining with removal of pillars may produce surface effects similar to longwall mining, with the degree of similarity dependent upon the amount of coal left as fenders or stumps. In addition, subsidence has active and residual phases. Active phase refers to the movements occurring simultaneously with the mining operations. Residual subsidence is the part of the surface deformation that occurs following the cessation of mining (or in case of longwall mining, after an underground excavation has reached its critical width). The magnitude of residual subsidence appears to be of the general order of 5 X 10% of the maximum subsidence. Duration of the residual subsidence is of particular importance from the stand-point of structural damage at the surface.
 Longwall mining with caving induces subsidence rapidly. However, using pillars may give rise to surface instability many years afterwards. The long-term stability of mine pillars is extremely difficult to determine ( Singh, 1992).

To sum up, it is difficult to calculate the accurate displacement or subsidence of every point in a body of rock because of the complexity of the factors affecting mine subsidence. Instead, various approximate methods have been used for this calculation. In fact, the movement or subsidence of each point on a level of the overburden can be regarded as a fuzzy event. In other words, this displacement or subsidence will take place at a fuzzy probability, and so the theory of fuzzy probability measures can be applied to describe the ground subsidence due to underground mining. 3.2. Fuzzy probability measure
The term  X  X  X uzzy probability X  X  have been applied to different concepts and formalized in various ways in past 30 years. 3.2.1. Applications of fuzzy probability in engineering (1) Applications of fuzzy probability in slope stability assessment (2) Risk assessment system of natural hazards (3) Reliability assessment method for pressure piping containing (4) Modelling attitude to risk in human decision processes (5) Application of fuzzy probabilistic method in the general (6) BIFPET methodology versus PERT in project management: (7) A probability of fuzzy events approach to validating expert (8) Fuzzy probability applied to analysis of rock mass displace-effects is an important problem of the rock mass mechanics in the excavation activities especially the coal and metal mining.
Li Wenxiu (1998) presented the fuzzy probability models and applied to the analysis of rock mass displacement due to deep mining of metal ore. The agreement of the theoretical results with the field measurements shows that our model is satisfactory and the formulae obtained are valid and thus can be effectively used for predicting the displacements and deformations and the safety evaluation of the buildings on the ground. 3.2.2. Fuzzy probability theory given in brief.

Definition 1. Suppose triplet ( O , B , M ) is a probability space, where O is a sample space, B is the fuzzy s -field of Borel sets in O (or fuzzy s -algebra), and M is the probability measure over O .
O -[0,1]) are two membership functions and m A measurable.

Definition 2. If A 1 and A 2 are two fuzzy events in the O , then we can define the fuzzy probability measures of A 1 and A 2 as follows: M  X  A 1  X  X  M  X  A 2  X  X  Here Eqns. (11) and (12) are Lebesgue X  X tieltjes integrals. integrals exist.

Definition 3. Let A 1 and A 2 be two fuzzy events in the probability space ( O , B , M ). A 1 and A 2 are said to be independent if M  X  A 1 A 2  X  X  M  X  A 1  X  M  X  A 2  X  X  9  X  integrals exist, and because B is a Borel field in the set O , it can readily verify that a fuzzy probability measure possesses the following properties:
Property 1. If A A B , then 0 r M  X  A  X  r 1  X  10  X  Property 2. For any set O , we have M  X  O  X  X  1  X  11  X 
Property 3. If A 1 , A 2 A B , and A 1 A 2 , M  X  A 1  X  r M  X  A 2  X  X  12  X 
Property 4. A n A B for 1 r n o N ( n is an integer), and A i , A j are mutually exclusive, i.e. A i A j  X  f  X  i a j  X  , then we have
M [ 1 M f X  X A 1 r x 1  X \ X  X A 2 r x 2  X \ ... \ X  X A n r x n  X g X  and d r  X  X  X  X  f  X  x 1 ; x 2 ; x 3 ; x n  X  X  15  X  Definition 4. Assume that  X  X  X  -m A  X  X  X  t  X  ; t  X  X  16  X  and is associated with a preassigned probability density d r ( X ( t )), then, in the n -dimensional case, we define M A ( t )as M  X  t  X  X  Definition 5. In the one-dimensional case, let d r = r dx to be such that  X  r  X  x ; t  X  X  18  X  while m A = m A ( x ) Then we have M  X  t  X  X 
With the above definitions and theories as a basis, the engineering problems in practical cases, can now be described. 3.3. The fuzzy probability model for practical engineering problems
When the subsidence of overburden takes place due to the underground mining, some points on the corresponding surface will deviate from their equilibrium positions, and so displace-ments will occur. Because ground subsidence is controlled by many factors, such as geologic conditions, the presence of groundwater, the properties of rock masses, mining conditions, etc., it is very difficult to predict ground subsidence (the magnitude and range of subsidence) accurately. Because the theory of fuzzy mathematics is generally taken to embrace the whole field of imprecisely described systems, the above theory of fuzzy probability can be used for this prediction. In addition, theory of fuzzy logic can be used for analysis of the data measured in the field and determination of fuzzy membership function (Pendharkar, 1997, 2003 ).

Consider an xoz cross-section of the overburden; for the points x ( i =1,2, y , n ) on that plane, the expression for the fuzzy probability of subsidence can be established. The set (denoted by A ) is called an  X  X  X ssociated set X  X , whose elements are the points of x -axis involved in the subsidence. Clearly, A 1 is a fuzzy subset in the set O .

From Wang (1983), we can see that the theory of fuzzy mathematics deals with the inexact concepts encountered in the real physical world, i.e. objects of a fuzzy type. By  X  X  X nexact concept X  X  we mean the set of those concepts which are uncertain in extension, and so the classification into which its elements are put does not have sharply defined boundaries (fuzziness).
In many cases, for the problem dealt with in this paper, the degree of membership can be assigned by the fuzzy statistical method, so as to study the indeterminacy by means of the deterministic system. The membership function for engineering problems can be assigned by the membership function of the points on the subsidence surface to the fuzzy subset A 1 (as mentioned above, A 1 is the set of the points on the subsidence surface).

As shown in Fig. 5 b, we only consider the points on the top of the mined-out area, and assign unity to the maximum degree of membership of x to A 1 . We assume that the following expression hold: 1  X  x  X  X  f  X  x  X  X  20  X  where f ( x ) is the relation function determined by the data measured in the field.

The statistical analysis is made by using a large amount of measured data, and the results obtained show that f ( x ) is a special function, where x are the measured points on the subsidence surface. From Eq. (22) we have the following expression of the non-symmetry membership function: 1  X  x  X  X  a  X  x = z  X 
This is the analytic expression for the membership function curve shown in Fig. 6 , where a , b , c , d are parameters determined by such factors as the mining conditions of a particular mining district and the occurrence of ore deposits, z is a constant to be determined.

The above density distribution function (i.e. the distri-bution function for the subsidence) can be established using the statistical theory of probability. In the case of the mining of ore, the subsidence of the ground surface depends on many factors. We shall consider the theory of the plane problems an particular cases of rock mass movements. In the xoz plane of the rectangular coordinates system, let d r ( x ) be the density function of the ground subsi-dence at point x in the xoz cross-section, from Li Wenxiu (1998) we have d r  X  x  X  X  X  x = z  X  b exp  X  g  X  x = z  X  d  X  ; x A 0 ; 1  X   X  22  X  where b , g , d are  X  X  X uzzy parameters X  X .

From definition 2 we obtain the expression of the fuzzy probability measures or ground subsidence in the xoz cross-section: M  X  A 1  X  X  Let b = b , c = g , d = d , then we have M  X  A 1  X  X  where D is the mining range, D A  X  0 ; x n ,n -1 .

The value calculated from Eq. (26) is the fuzzy probability for ground subsidence. However, the mining thickness and sub-sidence factor must be taken into account for calculating the practical surface subsidence S .
 S  X  k i M  X  A 1  X  X  25  X  where S is the practical ground subsidence; k i ( i =1, 2) represents the parameters which depend on the mining method and the rock properties, and can be determined from the measured data of mining district. For example, given the fuzzy probability of surface subsidence in a mining district M ( A 1 )=0.7, k 1 =2.5, k =0.6, then S x =0.7 2.5 0.6=1.05 m.

The new method (fuzzy probability measure method) has the following advantages: (1) it is simple, and theoretical prediction results can be obtained by numerical intergral; (2) it is suitable for the study of ground subsidence due to flat and inclined coal seam mining; and (3) results are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over traditional influence function procedures in terms of accuracy and stability. 4. Verification of fuzzy model
In order to demonstrate the application of the formula for the fuzzy probability of ground surface subsidence some examples are given of the practical application of the above theoretical results.

This region is one of the most important ore regions in China. The Chuncheng region contains three areas named Jinlan, Zhichun, and Yanqiu.

The monitored subsidence and results of the calculation using the above mathematical model are presented in Fig. 8 . The results of the calculation with the stochastic medium theory (SMT, non-fuzzy model) and FPM model indicate that the predicted value was in good agreement with the measured data ( Fig. 8 ). The results gained from surface subsidence measurements at Xiaoli mining area show an excellent correlation between the measured and the predicted subsidence by using the new model. 4.2.

A longwall face LINA-KM98 was extracted in LINA mining area of Xibei coal mine in northwest China. The topography in the district is complex, with the maximum relative difference of height up to 125 m, maximum slope 61 1 , average slope 20  X  30 1 . Table 3 summarizes the mining conditions. The maximum surface subsidence measured was 2.662 m. An empirical relationship has been obtained between the parameters defining the FPM model and geological and mining conditions ( Table 2 ).

From these data in Tables 3 and 4, we obtain the predicted results of ground subsidence due to underground mining by using the fuzzy model. The predicted results of the ground subsidences by using the new model and the stochastic medium theory (SMT, non-fuzzy model) are given in Fig. 9 .

Fig. 9 shows a comparison between the data points and the theoretical curves of the ground subsidence (in the x -direction). The agreement of the theoretical results with the field measure-ments shows that the FPM method (fuzzy model) is satisfactory and the formulae obtained are valid and thus can be effectively used for predicting the ground surface movements due to underground inclined coal seam mining.

From Figs. 8 and 9 , we obtain the predicted results of ground subsidence due to underground mining of inclined coal seam by using the fuzzy model. The new method (fuzzy model-FPM) has the following advantages: (1) It is simple, and theoretical prediction results can be obtain by (2) It is suitable for the study of ground subsidence due to (3) Results are presented to demonstrate the advantages of 5. Conclusions
In this study, a new mathematical model is proposed. It is formed from the fuzzy probability measures and the non-symmetric membership function that have been adjusted to three survey lines in a case study in the Xiaoli mining area east of China. The results gained from surface subsidence measurements at Xiaoli mining area show an excellent correlation between the measured and the predicted subsidence by using the new model. The correlation coefficient was 0.999, which is very high. The approximate fuzzy probability has been calculated and compared with the recorded data obtained from monitoring stations. The comparison shows that the theoretical prediction is in agreement with the observations.
The new method (fuzzy probability measure method) has the following advantages: (1) it is simple, and the theoretical prediction results can be obtained by numerical intergral; (2) it is suitable for the study of ground subsidence due to inclined coal seam and flat seam mining in mountainous areas; and (3) results are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over traditional stochastic medium theory (SMT) proce-dures in terms of accuracy and stability.

The theory of fuzzy probability, therefore, is valid for solving the engineering problems of excavation. It is to be expected that the wide application of the fuzzy mathematics theory will play an important role in the future.
