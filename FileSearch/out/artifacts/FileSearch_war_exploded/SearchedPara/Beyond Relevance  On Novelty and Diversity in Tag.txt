 We propose to explicitly exploit issues related to novelty and diversity in tag recommendation tasks, an unexplored re-search avenue (only relevance issues have been investigated so far), in order to improve user experience and satisfac-tion. We propose new tag recommendation strategies to cover these issues and highlight the involved challenges. H.3.1 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Content Analysis and Indexing Algorithms, Experimentation Tag Recommendation, Relevance, Novelty, Diversity
Tags have become very popular on the Web 2.0 as they facilitate and encourage users to create and share their own content. In this context, there is a large interest in develop-ing strategies to recommend tags to users, providing relevant and useful tag suggestions for a target object, and improv-ing the quality of the generated tags and, indirectly, of the IR services that rely on them.

Recommendation systems have historically focused mostly on maximizing the relevance of the recommended items. In tag recommendation, particularly, relevance can be defined from an object perspective, i.e., a relevant term describes well the content of the target object, or from a personal-ized one, i.e., a relevant term describes correctly the target content and satisfies the target user X  X  interests.
However, relevance by itself may not be enough to guar-antee recommendation usefulness and effectiveness [2]. For  X  example, consider a list of recommended tags given to a user u to describe an object o , in which all terms are related to content, but all of them are synonyms. Moreover, suppose that these terms have already been used by u to describe o . In both cases, although the recommended tags have high relevance, they are less interesting and useful than a more di-verse list of terms that bring novel information for the given object and user. Moreover, as we argued in [1], objects on the Web 2.0 may be multifaceted , being related to various topics, thus requiring more diversified tags to cover these topics. Thus, novelty and diversity are also key aspects for recommended tags, besides relevance.

Our goal is to develop novel tag recommendation meth-ods that consider novelty and diversity jointly with rele-vance. We have already proposed and evaluated two differ-ent strategies. Our first approach extends a state-of-the-art tag recommender based on Genetic Programming to include novelty and diversity metrics both as attributes and in the objective function [1]. This approach captures the novelty and diversity of a list of recommended tags implicitly , by in-troducing metrics that assess the semantic distance between different tags (diversity) and the inverse of the popularity of the tag in the application (novelty). Instead, inspired by [3], our second strategy explicitly takes into account the possi-ble topics (e.g., categories) underlying an object in order to promote tags with high coverage of topics and low redun-dancy, thus raising diversity with respect to these topics. We intend to extend these strategies to consider different weights for novelty and diversity for different objects and users, what is also still absent in the literature.
In sum, our goal is to address not only relevance, but also novelty and diversity in tag recommendation. To reach this goal, we intend to propose new metrics that estimate rele-vance, novelty and diversity of tags, as well as new tag rec-ommendation strategies which simultaneously exploit these aspects. Finally, we will perform experiments to evaluate these strategies, comparing their results (also regarding the three aspects) against state-of-the-art techniques, employ-ing real data from popular Web 2.0 applications, such as Bibsonomy, LastFM and YouTube.
