 Published 12 times a year 0169-023X/05 Printed in The Netherlands Submission of articles There are two options available for DKE:  X  Authors are strongly encouraged to submit their papers electronically by using online manuscript submission at http://www.elsubmit.com/ esubmit/datak. Authors interested in online submission are requested to go to the website and upload their manuscript and its associated artwork. An electronic (PDF) proof is generated and the reviewing process is carried out using that PDF. In some cases, authors may be asked by the Editor-in-chief or the Editor for Europe to send five printed copies of their paper in addition to the electronic submission, to be used during the reviewing process. The PDF file may be edited after acceptance to follow journal standards.  X  Alternatively, authors can send five copies of their paper (including one original of the figures) to the appropriate Editor.
 For the names and addresses of the Editor-in-chief and the Editor for
Europe, please refer to the list of Editors in each issue of the journal or on the journal X  X  homepage.
 General Articles must be written in good English.
 Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture or academic thesis), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, without the written consent of the Publisher.
 Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to transfer copyright . This transfer will ensure the widest possible dissemination of information. A letter will be sent to the corresponding author confirming receipt of the manuscript. A form facilitating transfer of copyright will be provided. If excerpts from other copyrighted works are included, the author(s) must obtain written permission from the copyright owners and credit the source(s) in the article. Elsevier has preprinted forms for use by authors in these cases. Please contact ES Global Rights Depart-ment, P.O.

Sending accepted articles to Elsevier in electronic format We accept most wordprocessing formats, but Word, WordPerfect or LaTeX is preferred. An electronic version of the text should be submitted together with the final hardcopy of the manuscript. The electronic version must match the hardcopy exactly. Always keep a backup copy of the electronic file for reference and safety. Label storage media with your name, journal title, and software used. Save your files using the default extension of the program used. No changes to the accepted version are permissible without the explicit approval of the Editor. Electronic files can be stored on 3.5 inch diskette, ZIP-disk or CD (either MS-DOS or Macintosh).

 Published 12 times a year 0169-023X/05 Printed in The Netherlands Submission of articles There are two options available for DKE:  X  Authors are strongly encouraged to submit their papers electronically by using online manuscript submission at http://www.elsubmit.com/ esubmit/datak. Authors interested in online submission are requested to go to the website and upload their manuscript and its associated artwork. An electronic (PDF) proof is generated and the reviewing process is carried out using that PDF. In some cases, authors may be asked by the Editor-in-chief or the Editor for Europe to send five printed copies of their paper in addition to the electronic submission, to be used during the reviewing process. The PDF file may be edited after acceptance to follow journal standards.  X  Alternatively, authors can send five copies of their paper (including one original of the figures) to the appropriate Editor.
 For the names and addresses of the Editor-in-chief and the Editor for
Europe, please refer to the list of Editors in each issue of the journal or on the journal X  X  homepage.
 General Articles must be written in good English.
 Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture or academic thesis), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, without the written consent of the Publisher.
 Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to transfer copyright . This transfer will ensure the widest possible dissemination of information. A letter will be sent to the corresponding author confirming receipt of the manuscript. A form facilitating transfer of copyright will be provided. If excerpts from other copyrighted works are included, the author(s) must obtain written permission from the copyright owners and credit the source(s) in the article. Elsevier has preprinted forms for use by authors in these cases. Please contact ES Global Rights Depart-ment, P.O.

 Published 12 times a year 0169-023X/05 Printed in The Netherlands Submission of articles There are two options available for DKE:  X  Authors are strongly encouraged to submit their papers electronically by using online manuscript submission at http://www.elsubmit.com/ esubmit/datak. Authors interested in online submission are requested to go to the website and upload their manuscript and its associated artwork. An electronic (PDF) proof is generated and the reviewing process is carried out using that PDF. In some cases, authors may be asked by the Editor-in-chief or the Editor for Europe to send five printed copies of their paper in addition to the electronic submission, to be used during the reviewing process. The PDF file may be edited after acceptance to follow journal standards.  X  Alternatively, authors can send five copies of their paper (including one original of the figures) to the appropriate Editor.
 For the names and addresses of the Editor-in-chief and the Editor for
Europe, please refer to the list of Editors in each issue of the journal or on the journal X  X  homepage.
 General Articles must be written in good English.
 Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture or academic thesis), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, without the written consent of the Publisher.
 Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to transfer copyright . This transfer will ensure the widest possible dissemination of information. A letter will be sent to the corresponding author confirming receipt of the manuscript. A form facilitating transfer of copyright will be provided. If excerpts from other copyrighted works are included, the author(s) must obtain written permission from the copyright owners and credit the source(s) in the article. Elsevier has preprinted forms for use by authors in these cases. Please contact ES Global Rights Depart-ment, P.O.

Sending accepted articles to Elsevier in electronic format We accept most wordprocessing formats, but Word, WordPerfect or LaTeX is preferred. An electronic version of the text should be submitted together with the final hardcopy of the manuscript. The electronic version must match the hardcopy exactly. Always keep a backup copy of the electronic file for reference and safety. Label storage media with your name, journal title, and software used. Save your files using the default extension of the program used. No changes to the accepted version are permissible without the explicit approval of the Editor. Electronic files can be stored on 3.5 inch diskette, ZIP-disk or CD (either MS-DOS or Macintosh).
 LaTeX documents If the LaTeX file is suitable, proofs will be produced without rekeying the text. The article should preferably be written using Elsevier X  X  document class  X  X lsart X , or alternatively the standard document class  X  X rticle X . The Elsevier LaTeX package (including detailed instructions for LaTeX preparation) can be obtained from Elsevier X  X  web site: http://authors. elsevier.com.

 General Articles must be written in good English.
 Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture or academic thesis), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, without the written consent of the Publisher.
 Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to transfer copyright . This transfer will ensure the widest possible dissemination of information. A letter will be sent to the corresponding author confirming receipt of the manuscript. A form facilitating transfer of copyright will be provided. If excerpts from other copyrighted works are included, the author(s) must obtain written permission from the copyright owners and credit the source(s) in the article.

 General Articles must be written in good English.
 Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture or academic thesis), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, without the written consent of the Publisher.
 Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to transfer copyright . This transfer will ensure the widest possible dissemination of information. A letter will be sent to the corresponding author confirming receipt of the manuscript. A form facilitating transfer of copyright will be provided. If excerpts from other copyrighted works are included, the author(s) must obtain written permission from the copyright owners and credit the source(s) in the article.

Authors interested in online submission are requested to go to the website and upload their manuscript and its associated artwork. An electronic (PDF) proof is generated and the reviewing process is carried out using that PDF. In some cases, authors may be asked by the Editor-in-chief or the Editor for Europe to send five printed copies of their paper in addition to the electronic submission, to be used during the reviewing process. The
PDF file may be edited after acceptance to follow journal standards.  X  Alternatively, authors can send five copies of their paper (including one original of the figures) to the appropriate Editor.
 For the names and addresses of the Editor-in-chief and the Editor for
Europe, please refer to the list of Editors in each issue of the journal or on the journal X  X  homepage.
 General Articles must be written in good English.
 Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture or academic thesis), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, without the written consent of the Publisher.
 Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to transfer copyright . This transfer will ensure the widest possible dissemination of information. A letter will be sent to the corresponding author confirming receipt of the manuscript. A form facilitating transfer of copyright will be provided. If excerpts from other copyrighted works are included, the author(s) must obtain written permission from the copyright owners and credit the source(s) in the article. Elsevier has preprinted forms for use by authors in these cases. Please contact ES Global Rights Depart-ment, P.O. Box 800, Oxford, OX5 1DX, UK; phone: (+44) (1865) 843830, fax: (+44) (1865) 853333, e-mail: permissions@elsevier.co.uk Upon acceptance of an article, the authors will be asked by the editors to supply a photo (passport size) and short biography of each author. Sending accepted articles to Elsevier in electronic format We accept most wordprocessing formats, but Word, WordPerfect or LaTeX is preferred. An electronic version of the text should be submitted together with the final hardcopy of the manuscript. The electronic version must match the hardcopy exactly. Always keep a backup copy of the electronic file for reference and safety. Label storage media with your name, journal title, and software used. Save your files using the default extension of the program used. No changes to the accepted version are permissible without the explicit approval of the Editor. Electronic files can be stored on 3.5 inch diskette, ZIP-disk or CD (either MS-DOS or Macintosh).
 LaTeX documents If the LaTeX file is suitable, proofs will be produced without rekeying the text. The article should preferably be written using Elsevier X  X  document class  X  X lsart X , or alternatively the standard document class  X  X rticle X . The Elsevier LaTeX package (including detailed instructions for LaTeX preparation) can be obtained from Elsevier X  X  web site: http://www. elsevier.com/authors (go to Guide to publishing with Elsevier). It consists of the files: elsart.cls (use this file if you are using LaTeX2e, the current version of LaTeX), elsart.sty and elsart13.sty (use these two files if you are using LaTeX3.09, the previous version of LaTeX), guidelines for users of elsart, a template file for quick start, and the instruction booklet  X  X  X reparing articles with LaTeX X  X .
