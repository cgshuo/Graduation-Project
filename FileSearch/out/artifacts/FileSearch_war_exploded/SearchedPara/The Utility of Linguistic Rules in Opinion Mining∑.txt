 Online product reviews are one of the important opinion sources on the Web. This paper studies the problem of determining the semantic orientations (positive or negative) of opinions expressed on product features in reviews. Mo st existing approaches use a set of opinion words for the purpose. However, the semantic orientations of many words are c ontext dependent. In this paper, we propose to use some linguistic rules to deal with the problem together with a new opinion aggregation function. Extensive experiments show that these ru les and the function are highly effective. A system, called Opinion Observer , has also been built.

In recent years, many researchers studied the problem of opinion mining from Web sources (e.g., pr oduct reviews, forum posts and blogs) [4]. In this work, we focus on product reviews. The general problem of opinion mining from product reviews is to identify product features that have been commented on by each reviewer and to determine whether the opinions are positive or negative (called semantic (or opinion ) orientation ) [2, 4]. In this paper, we only study the latter problem, i.e., determining whether an opinion is positive or negative. We assume that product features are given or have been discovered by another system [e.g., 2]. Existing techniques use opinion word s such as  X  X reat X ,  X  X mazing X ,  X  X oor X ,  X  X ad X , etc, to decide the orientation of an opinion on a product feature. Although the orientations of these words are obvious, the orientations of many other words depend on context. For example, the word  X  X mall X  can indicate a positive or a negative opinion on a product feature depending on the feature. We propose several linguistic rules to deal with the problem. The approach tries to infer the orientations of opinions on a product feature using context. A new f unction for aggregating multiple opinions in a sentence is also pres ented. Experiment results show that the rules and the aggregation function are very useful. 2. Pseudo intra-sentence conjunction rule : Sometimes, one may 3. Inter-sentence conjunction rule : The conjunction rule can also For rules 1 and 2, it is possible that in the reviews of a product the same opinion word for the sa me feature has conflicting orientations. For example, anot her reviewer may say:  X  X his camera is very small, which I don X  X  like X . In this case, our algorithm takes the majority view. If more people indicate that  X  X mall X  is positive for size, we tr eat it as positive and vice versa. Synonym and Antonym Rule : If a word is found to be positive (or negative) in a context for a feature, its synonyms are also considered positive (or negative), a nd its antonyms are considered negative (or positive). For example, in the above sentence, we know that  X  X ong X  is positive for  X  X attery life X . Then we also know that  X  X hort X  is negative for  X  X attery life X . We also have a set of rules to consider special words such as  X  X ut X ,  X  X owever X ,  X  X ot X ,  X  X oo X , etc, which are also important. Algorithm : The algorithm, which considers all the rules and the opinion aggregation function, is fair ly simple to design. It works iteratively. In each iteration, the opinion orientations of some opinion words can infer the orient ations of some other opinion words, which in turn will help infer yet some more subsequently. Due to space limitations, we are unable to give the details. Related work : Our technique is similar to those in [1, 3], which use conjunction rules to find domain opinion words from large domain corpora. There is, however , an important difference. We believe that finding domain opinion words is still problematic because in the same domain the same word may have different orientations depending on what features it is applied to. For example, in the following review sentences in the camera domain,  X  X he battery life is very long  X  and  X  X t takes a long time to focus X ,  X  X ong X  is positive in the first sent ence, but negative in the second. Thus, we need to consider both the feature and the opinion word rather than only the opinion word as in [1, 3]. [5] also uses similar rules to compute opinion orie ntations based on relaxation labeling. However, [5] produces poorer results than our method.
