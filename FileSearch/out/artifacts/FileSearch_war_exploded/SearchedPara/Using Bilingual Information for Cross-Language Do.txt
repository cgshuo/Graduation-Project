 Cross-language document summarization is de-fined as the task of producing a summary in a dif-ferent target language for a set of documents in a source language (Wan et al., 2010). In this study, we focus on English-to-Chinese cross-language summarization, which aims to produce Chinese summaries for English docume nt sets. The task is very useful in the field of multilingual information access. For example, it is beneficial for most Chi-nese readers to quickly browse and understand English news documents or document sets by read-ing the corresponding Chinese summaries. 
A few pilot studies have investigated the task in recent years and exiting methods make use of ei-ther the information in the source language or the information in the target language after using ma-chine translation. In particular, for the task of Eng-lish-to-Chinese cross-language summarization, one method is to directly extract English summary sen-tences based on English features extracted from the English documents, and then automatically trans-late the English summary sentences into Chinese summary sentences. The other method is to auto-matically translate the English sentences into Chi-nese sentences, and then directly extract Chinese summary sentences based on Chinese features. The two methods make use of the information from only one language side. 
However, it is not very reliable to use only the information in one language, because the machine translation quality is far from satisfactory, and thus the translated Chinese sentences usually contain some errors and noises. For example, the English sentence  X  Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area.  X  is automatically translated into the Chinese sentence  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  by using Google Translate 1 , but the Chinese sentence contains a few translation errors. Therefore, on the one side, if we rely only on the English-side information to extract Chinese summary sentences, we cannot guarantee that the automatically translated Chinese sentences for sa-lient English sentences are really salient when these sentences may contain many translation er-rors and other noises. On the other side, if we rely only on the Chinese-side information to extract Chinese summary sentences, we cannot guarantee that the selected sentences are really salient be-cause the features for sentence ranking based on the incorrectly translated sentences are not very reliable, either. 
In this study, we propose to leverage both the in-formation in the source language and the informa-tion in the target language for cross-language document summarization. In particular, we pro-pose two graph-based summarization methods (SimFusion and CoRank) for using both English-side and Chinese-side information in the task of English-to-Chinese cross-document summarization. The SimFusion method linearly fuses the English-side similarity and the Chinese-side similarity for measuring Chinese sentence similarity. The CoRank method adopts a co-ranking algorithm to simultaneously rank both English sentences and Chinese sentences by incorporating mutual influ-ences between them. 
We use the DUC2001 dataset with manually translated reference Chin ese summaries for evalua-tion. Experimental results based on the ROUGE metrics show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Three important conclusions for this task are summarized below: 1) The Chinese-side information is more benefi-2) The Chinese-side information and the Eng-3) The proposed CoRank method is more reli-The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces related work. In Section 3, we present our proposed methods. Evaluation results are shown in Section 4. Lastly, we conclude this paper in Section 5. Document summarization methods can be extrac-tion-based, abstraction-based or hybrid methods. We focus on extraction-based methods in this study, and the methods directly extract summary sentences from a document or document set by ranking the sentences in the document or document set. 
In the task of single document summarization, various features have been investigated for ranking sentences in a document, including term frequency, sentence position, cue word s, stigma words, and topic signature (Luhn 1969; Lin and Hovy, 2000). Machine learning techniques have been used for sentence ranking (Kupiec et al., 1995; Amini and Gallinari, 2002). Litvak et al. (2010) present a lan-guage-independent approach for extractive summa-rization based on the linear optimization of several sentence ranking measures using a genetic algo-rithm. In recent years, graph-based methods have been proposed for sentence ranking (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea a nd Tarau, 2004). Other methods include mutual reinforcement principle (Zha 2002; Wan et al., 2007). the centroid-based method (Radev et al., 2004) ranks the sentences in a document set based on such features as cluster centroids, position and TFIDF. Machine Learning techniques have also been used for feature combining (Wong et al., 2008). Nenkova and Louis (2008) investigate the influences of input difficulty on summarization performance. Pitler et al. (2010) present a system-atic assessment of several diverse classes of met-rics designed for automatic evaluation of linguistic quality of multi-document summaries. Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur (2010) formulate extractive summarization as a two-step learning problem by building a generative model for pattern discovery and a regression model for inference. Aker et al. (2010) propose an A* search algorithm to find the best extractive summary up to a given length, and they propose a discriminative training algorithm for directly maximizing the quality of the best summary. Graph-based methods have also been used to rank sentences for multi-document summa-rization (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2005; Wan and Yang, 2008). Several pilot studies have investigated the task of cross-language document summarization. The ex-isting methods use only the information in either language side. Two typical translation schemes are document translation or summary translation. The document translation scheme first translates the source documents into the corresponding docu-ments in the target language, and then extracts summary sentences based only on the information on the target side. The summary translation scheme first extracts summary sentences from the source documents based only on the information on the source side, and then translates the summary sen-tences into the corresponding summary sentences in the target language. 
For example Leuski et al. (2003) use machine translation for English headline generation for Hindi documents. Lim et al. (2004) propose to generate a Japanese summary by using Korean summarizer. Chalendar et al. (2005) focus on se-mantic analysis and sentence generation techniques for cross-language summarization. Orasan and Chiorean (2008) propose to produce summaries with the MMR method from Romanian news arti-cles and then automatically translate the summaries into English. Cross language query based summa-rization has been investigated in (Pingali et al., 2007), where the query and the documents are in different languages. Wan et al. (2010) adopt the summary translation scheme for the task of Eng-lish-to-Chinese cross-language summarization. They first extract English summary sentences by using English-side features and the machine trans-lation quality factor, and then automatically trans-late the English summary into Chinese summary. Other related work includes multilingual summari-zation (Lin et al., 2005; Siddharthan and McKe-own, 2005), which aims to create summaries from multiple sources in multiple languages. As mentioned in Section 1, existing methods rely only on one-side information for sentence ranking, which is not very reliable. In order to leveraging both-side information for sentence ranking, we propose the following two methods to incorporate the bilingual information in different ways. 3.1 SimFusion This method uses the English-side information for Chinese sentence ranking in the graph-based framework. The sentence si milarities in the two languages are fused in the method. In other words, when we compute the similarity value between two Chinese sentences, the similarity value between the corresponding two English sentences is used by linear fusion. Since sentence similarity evaluation plays a very important role in the graph-based ranking algorithm, this method can leverage both-side information through similarity fusion. 
Formally, given the Chinese document set D cn translated from an English document set, let G cn =( V cn , E cn ) be an undirected graph to reflect the relationships between the sentences in the Chinese document set. V cn is the set of vertices and each vertex s cn i in V cn represents a Chinese sentence. E is the set of edges. Each edge e cn ij in E cn is associ-ated with an affinity weight f ( s cn i , s cn j ) between sen-linearly combining the similarity value sim cosine ( s cn s j ) between the Chinese sentences and the simi-sponding English sentences. the relative contributions of the two similarity val-ues. The similarity values sim cosine ( s cn i , s cn dard cosine measure. The weight for each term is computed based on the TFIDF formula. For Chi-nese similarity computation, Chinese word seg-mentation is perform ed. Here, we have f ( s s j )= f ( s transition. We use an affinity matrix M cn to de-scribe G cn with each entry corresponding to the weight of an edge in the graph. M cn =( M cn ij ) is defined as M cn ij = f ( s cn i ,s cn j ). Then M ized to cn M ~ to make the sum of each row equal to 1. Score(s cn i ) for sentence s cn i can be deduced from those of all other sentences linked with it and it can be formulated in a recursive form as in the PageR-ank algorithm: where n is the sentence number, i.e. n = | V cn the damping factor usually set to 0.85, as in the PageRank algorithm. 
For numerical computation of the saliency scores, we can iteratively run the above equation until convergence.

For multi-document summarization, some sen-tences are highly overlapping with each other, and thus we apply the same greedy algorithm in Wan et al. (2006) to penalize the sentences highly overlap-ping with other highly scored sentences, and fi-nally the salient and novel Chinese sentences are directly selected as summary sentences. 3.2 CoRank This method leverages both the English-side in-formation and the Chinese-side information in a co-ranking way. The source English sentences and the translated Chinese sentences are simultane-ously ranked in a unified graph-based algorithm. The saliency of each English sentence relies not only on the English sentences linked with it, but also on the Chinese sentences linked with it. Simi-larly, the saliency of each Chinese sentence relies not only on the Chinese sentences linked with it, but also on the English sentences linked with it. More specifically, the proposed method is based on the following assumptions: 
Assumption 1 : A Chinese sentence would be salient if it is heavily linked with other salient Chi-nese sentences; and an English sentence would be salient if it is heavily linked with other salient Eng-lish sentences. 
Assumption 2 : A Chinese sentence would be salient if it is heavily linked with salient English sentences; and an English sentence would be sali-ent if it is heavily linked with salient Chinese sen-tences. 
The first assumption is similar to PageRank which makes use of mutual  X  X ecommendations X  between the sentences in the same language to rank sentences. The second assumption is similar to HITS if the English sentences and the Chinese sen-tences are considered as authorities and hubs, re-spectively. In other words, the proposed method aims to fuse the ideas of PageRank and HITS in a unified framework. The mutual influences between the Chinese sentences and the English sentences are incorporated in the method. Figure 1 gives the graph representation for the method. Three kinds of relationships are exploited: the CN-CN relationships between Chinese sen-tences, the EN-EN relationships between English sentences, and the EN-CN relationships between English sentences and Chinese sentences. 
Formally, given an English document set D en and the translated Chinese document set D cn , let G =( V en V cn , E en , E cn , E encn ) be an undirected graph to reflect all the three kinds of relationships between the sen-tences in the two document sets. V en ={ s en i | 1  X  i  X  n } the set of Chinese sentences. s cn i is the correspond-number of the sentences. E en is the edge set to re-flect the relationships between the English sen-relationships between the Chinese sentences. E encn is the edge set to reflect the relationships between the English sentences a nd the Chinese sentences. Based on the graph representation, we compute the following three affinity ma trices to reflect the three kinds of sentence relationships: reflect the relationships between the Chinese sen-tences. Each entry in the matrix corresponds to the cosine similarity between the two Chinese sen-tences. Then M cn is normalized to cn M sum of each row equal to 1. reflect the relationships between the English sen-tences. Each entry in the matrix corresponds to the cosine similarity between the two English sen-tences. 
Then M en is normalized to en M sum of each row equal to 1. reflect the relationships between the English sen-tences and the Chinese sentences. Each entry M between the English sentence s en i and the Chinese sentence s cn j . It is hard to directly compute the similarity between the sentences in different lan-guages. In this study, the similarity value is com-puted by fusing the following two similarity values: the cosine similarity between the sentence s en i and the corresponding source English sentence s en j for s j , and the cosine similarity between the corre-sponding translated Chinese sentence s cn i for s and the sentence s cn j . We use the geometric mean of the two values as the affinity weight. M to make the sum of each row equal to 1. 
We use two column vectors u =[ u ( s cn i )] n  X 1 and v Chinese sentences and the English sentences, re-spectively. Based on the three kinds of relation-ships, we can get the following four assumptions: 
After fusing the above equations, we can obtain the following iterative forms: 
And the matrix form is: where  X  and  X  specify the relative contributions to the final saliency scores from the information in the same language and the information in the other language and we have  X  +  X  =1. 
For numerical computation of the saliency scores, we can iteratively run the two equations until convergence. Usually the convergence of the iteration algorithm is achieved when the difference between the scores computed at two successive iterations for any sentences and words falls below a given threshold. In order to guarantee the con-vergence of the iterative form, u and v are normal-ized after each iteration. 
After we get the saliency scores u for the Chi-nese sentences, we apply the same greedy algo-rithm for redundancy removing. Finally, a few highly ranked sentences are selected as summary sentences. 4.1 Evaluation Setup There is no benchmark dataset for English-to-Chinese cross-language document summarization, so we built our evaluation dataset based on the DUC2001 dataset by manually translating the ref-erence summaries. 
DUC2001 provided 30 English document sets for generic multi-document summarization. The average document number per document set was 10. The sentences in each article have been sepa-rated and the sentence information has been stored into files. Three or two generic reference English summaries were provided by NIST annotators for each document set. Three graduate students were employed to manually translate the reference Eng-lish summaries into reference Chinese summaries. Each student manually translated one third of the reference summaries. It was much easier and more reliable to provide the reference Chinese summa-ries by manual translation than by manual summa-rization. All the English sentences in the document set were automatically translated into Chinese sen-tences by using Google Translate , and the Stanford Chinese Word Segmenter 2 was used for segment-ing the Chinese documents and summaries into words. For comparative st udy, the summary length was limited to five sentences, i.e. each Chinese summary consisted of five sentences. 2003) toolkit for evaluation, which has been widely adopted by DUC and TAC for automatic summarization evaluation. It measured summary quality by counting overlapping units such as the n-gram, word sequences and word pairs between the candidate summary and the reference summary. We showed three of the ROUGE F-measure scores in the experimental results: ROUGE-2 (bigram-based), ROUGE-W (based on weighted longest common subsequence, weight=1.2), ROUGE-L (based on longest common subsequences), and ROUGE-SU4 (based on skip bigram with a maxi-mum skip distance of 4). Note that the ROUGE toolkit was performed for Chinese summaries after using word segmentation. parison. 
Baseline(EN) : This baseline adopts the sum-mary translation scheme, and it relies on the Eng-lish-side information for English sentence ranking. The extracted English summary is finally auto-matically translated into the corresponding Chinese summary. The same sentence ranking algorithm with the SimFusion method is adopted, and the affinity weight is computed based only on the co-sine similarity between English sentences. 
Baseline(CN) : This baseline adopts the docu-ment translation scheme, and it relies on the Chi-nese-side information for Chinese sentence ranking. The Chinese summary sente nces are directly ex-tracted from the translated Chinese documents. The same sentence ranking algorithm with the SimFusion method is adopted, and the affinity weight is computed based only on the cosine simi-larity between Chinese sentences. ues are empirically set as  X  = 0.8 and  X  =0.5. 4.2 Results and Discussion Table 1 shows the comparison results for our pro-posed methods and the baseline methods. Seen from the tables, Baseline(CN) performs better than Baseline(EN) over all the metrics. The results dem-onstrate that the Chinese-side information is more beneficial than the English-side information for cross-document summarization, because the sum-mary sentences are finally selected from the Chi-nese side. Moreover, our proposed two methods can outperform the two baselines over all the met-rics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using bilingual information for cross-language document summarization. It is noteworthy that the ROUGE scores in the table are not high due to the following two reasons: 1) The use of machine translation may introduce many errors and noises in the peer Chinese summari es; 2) The use of Chi-nese word segmentation may introduce more noises and mismatches in the ROUGE evaluation based on Chinese words. We can also see that the CoRank method can outperform the SimFusion method over all metrics. The results show that the CoRank method is more suitable for the task by incorporating the bilingual information into a unified ranking framework. 
In order to show the influence of the value of the combination parameter  X  on the performance of the SimFusion method, we present the performance curves over the four metrics in Figures 2 through 5, respectively. In the figures,  X  ranges from 0 to 1, and  X  =1 means that SimFusion is the same with Baseline(CN), and  X  =0 means that only English-side information is used for Chinese sentence rank-ing. We can see that when  X  is set to a value larger than 0.5, SimFusion can outperform the two base-lines over most metrics. The results show that  X  can be set in a relatively wide range. Note that  X  &gt;0.5 means that SimFusion relies more on the Chinese-side information than on the English-side information. Therefore, the Chinese-side informa-tion is more beneficial than the English-side in-formation. 
In order to show the influence of the value of the combination parameter  X  on the performance of the CoRank method, we present the performance curves over the four metrics in Figures 6 through 9, respectively. In the figures,  X  ranges from 0.1 to 0.9, and a larger value me ans that the information from the same language side is more relied on, and a smaller value means that the information from the other language side is more relied on. We can see that CoRank can always outperform the two baselines over all metrics with different value of  X  . The results show that  X  can be set in a very wide range. We also note that a very large value or a very small value of  X  can lower the performance values. The results demonstrate that CoRank relies on both the information from the same language side and the information from the other language side for sentence ranking. Therefore, both the Chi-nese-side information and the English-side infor-mation can complement each other, and they are beneficial to the final summarization performance. 
Comparing Figures 2 through 5 with Figures 6 through 9, we can further see that the CoRank method is more stable and robust than the Sim-Fusion method. The CoRank method can outper-form the SimFusion method with most parameter settings. The bilingual information can be better incorporated in the unified ranking framework of the CoRank method. 
Finally, we show one running example for the document set D59 in the DUC2001 dataset. The four summaries produced by the four methods are listed below: In this paper, we propose two methods (SimFusion and CoRank) to address the cross-language docu-ment summarization task by leveraging the bilin-gual information in both the source and target language sides. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The Chi-nese-side information is validated to be more bene-ficial than the English-side information, and the CoRank method is more robust than the SimFusion method. In future work, we will investigate to use the machine translation quality factor to further im-prove the fluency of the Chinese summary, as in Wan et al. (2010). Though our attempt to use GIZA++ for evaluating the similarity between Chinese sentences and English sentences failed, we will exploit more advanced measures based on sta-tistical alignment model for cross-language simi-larity computation.
