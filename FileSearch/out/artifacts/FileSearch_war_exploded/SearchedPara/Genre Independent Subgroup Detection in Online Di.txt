There has been a significant increase in discus-sion forum data in online media recently. Most of such discussion threads have a clear debate compo-nent in them with varying levels of formality. Auto-matically identifying the groups of discussants with similar attitudes, or subgroup detection, is an inter-esting problem which allows for a better understand-ing of the data in this genre in a manner that could directly benefit Opinion Mining research as well as Community Mining from Social Networks.

A straight-forward approach to this problem is to apply Opinion Mining techniques, and extract each discussant X  X  attitudes towards other discussants and entities being discussed. But the challenge is that Opinion Mining is not mature enough to ex-tract all the correct opinions of discussants. In ad-dition, without domain knowledge, using unsuper-vised techniques to do this is quite challenging.
On observing interactions from these threads, we believe that there is another dimension of attitude which is expressed implicitly. We find that people sharing the same opinion tend to speak about the same topics even though they do not explicitly ex-press their sentiment. We refer to this as Implicit Attitude . One such example may be seen in the two posts in Table 1. It can be seen that even though dis-cussants A and B do not express explicit sentiments, they hold similar views. Hence it can be said that there is an agreement in their implicit attitudes.
Attempting to find a surface level word similar-ity between posts of two discussants is not sufficient as there are typically few overlapping words shared among the posts. This is quite significant a problem especially given the relative short context of posts. Accordingly, in this work, we attempt to model the implicit latent similarity between posts as a means of identifying the implicit attitudes among discussants. We apply variants on Latent Dirichelet Allocation (LDA) based topic models to the problem (Blei et al., 2003).

Our goal is identify subgroups with respect to dis-cussants X  attitudes towards each other, the entities and topics in a discussion forum. To our knowl-edge, this is the first attempt at using text similar-ity as an indication of user attitudes. We investigate the influence of the explicit and implicit attitudes on two genres of data, one more formal than the other. We find an interesting trend. Explicit attitude alone as a feature is more useful than implicit attitude in identifying sub-groups in informal data. But in the case of formal data, implicit attitude yields better re-sults. This may be due to the fact that in informal data, strong subjective opinions about entities/events or towards other discussants are expressed more ex-plicitly. This is generally not the case in the formal genre where ideas do not have as much sentiment as-sociated with them, and hence the opinions are more  X  X mplicit X . Finally, we observe that combining both kinds of features improves performance of our sys-tems for both genres.
Substantial research exists in the fields of Opin-ion Identification and Community Mining that is re-lated to our current work. (Ganapathibhotla and Liu, 2008) deal with the problem of finding opin-ions from comparative sentences. Many previous research efforts related to Opinion Target Identifi-cation (Hu and Liu, 2004; Kobayashi et al., 2007; Jakob and Gurevych, 2010), focus on the domain of product reviews where they exploit the genre in mul-tiple ways. Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) used unsupervised methods to identify stances in online debates. They mine the web to find associations indicative of opinions and combine them with dis-course information. Their problem essentially deals with the debate genre and finding the stance of an in-dividual given two options. Ours is a more general problem since we deal with discussion data in gen-eral and not debates on specific topics. Hence our aim is to identify multiple groups, not just two. In terms of Sentiment Analysis, the work done by Hassan et al.(2010) in using part-of-speech and de-pendency structures to identify polarities of attitudes is similar to our work. But they predict binary po-larities in attitudes, and our goal of identification of sub-groups is a more general problem in that we aim at identifying multiple subgroups.
We tackle the problem using Vector Space Mod-eling techniques to represent the discussion threads. Each vector represents a discussant in the thread cre-ating an Attitude Profile (AP). We use a clustering algorithm to partition the vector space of APs into multiple sub-groups. The idea is that resulting clus-ters would comprise sub-groups of discussants with similar attitudes. 3.1 Basic Features We use two basic features, namely Negative and Positive sentiment towards specific discussants and entities like in the work done by (Abu-Jbara et al., 2012). We start off by determining sentences that express attitude in the thread, attitude sentences (AS). We use OpinionFinder (Wilson et al., 2005) which employs negative and positive polarity cues. For determining discussant sentiment, we need to first identify who the target of their sentiment is: an-other discussant, or an entity, where an entity could be a topic or a person not participating in the dis-cussion. Sentiment toward another discussant: This is quite challenging since explicit sentiment ex-pressed in a post is not necessarily directed towards another discussant to whom it is a reply. It is pos-sible that a discussant may be replying to another poster but expressing an attitude towards a third en-tity or discussant. However as a simplifying assump-tion, similar to the work of (Hassan et al., 2010), we adopt the view that replies in the sentences that are determined to be attitudinal and contain second-person pronouns (you, your, yourself) are assumed to be directed towards the recipients of the replies. Sentiment toward an entity: We again adopt a sim-plifying view by modeling all the named entities in a sentence without heeding the roles these entities play, i.e. whether they are targets or not. Accord-ingly, we extract all the named entities in a sentence using Stanford X  X  Name Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005). We only focus on Person and Organiza-tion named entities. 3.2 Extracting Implicit Attitudes
We define implicit attitudes as the semantic sim-ilarity between texts comprising discussant utter-ances or posts in a thread. We cannot find enough overlapping words between posts, since some posts are very short. Hence we apply LDA (Blei et al., 2003) on texts to extract latent semantics of texts. We split text into sentences, i.e., each sentence is treated as a single document. Accordingly, each sen-tence is represented as a K -dimension vector. By computing the similarity on these vectors, we obtain a more accurate semantic similarity. 3.3 Clustering Attitude Space A tree-based (hierarchical) clustering algorithm, SLINK (Sibson, 1973) is used to cluster the vec-tor space. Cosine Similarity between the vectors is used as the inter-data point similarity measure for clustering. 1 We choose the number of clusters to be d p n al., 1979), where n is the number of discussants in the group. This rule seems to be validated by the fact that in the data sets with which we experiment, we note that the predicted number of clusters according to this rule and the classes identified in the gold data are very close as illustrated in Table 2. On average we note that the gold data has the number of classes per thread to be roughly 2-5.
We use data from two online forums -Cre-ate Debate [CD] 2 and discussions from Wikipedia [WIKI] 3 . There is a significant difference in the kind of discussions in these two sources. Our WIKI data comprises 117 threads crawled from Wikipedia. It is relatively formal with short threads. It does not have much negative polarity and discussants essentially discuss the Wikipedia page in question. Hence it is closer to an academic discussion forum. The threads are manually annotated with sub-group information. Given a thread, the annotator is asked to identify if there are any sub-groups among the discussants with similar opinions, and if yes, the membership of those subgroups.

On the other hand, CD is a forum where people debate a specific topic. The CD data we use com-prises 34 threads. It is more informal (with per-vasive negative language and personal insults) than WIKI and has longer threads. It is closer to the de-bate genre. It has a poll associated with every de-bate. The votes cast by the discussants in the poll are used as the class labels for our experiments. De-tailed statistics related to both the data sets and a comparison can be found in Table 3.
The following three features represent discussant attitudes:  X  Sentiment towards other discussants (SD) -This corresponds to 2  X  n dimensions in the Attitude Pro-file (AP) vector, n being the number of discussants in the thread. This is because there are two polari-ties and n possible targets. The value representing this feature is the number of sentences with the re-spective polarity  X  negative or positive  X  towards the particular discussant.  X  Sentiment towards entities in discussion (SE) -Number of dimensions corresponding to this feature is 2  X  e , where e is the number of entities discovered. Similar to SD, the value taken by this feature is the number of sentences in which that specific polarity is shown by the discussant towards the entity.  X  Implicit Attitude (IA) -n  X  t dimensions are ex-pressed using this feature, where t is the number of topics that the topic model contains. This means that the AP of every discussant contains the topic model distribution of his/her interactions with every other member in the thread. Hence, the topics in the inter-ation between the given discussant and other mem-bers in the thread are being modeled here. Accord-ingly, high vector similarity due to IA between two members in a thread means that they discussed sim-ilar topics with the same people in the thread. In our experiments, we set t = 50 . We use the Gibbs sampling based LDA (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004). The LDA model is built on definitions of two online dictionaries WordNet, and Wiktionary, in addition to the Brown corpus (BC). To create more context, each sentence from BC is treated as a document. The whole corpus contains 393,667 documents and 5,080,369 words.

The degree of agreement among discussants in terms of these three features is used to identify sub-groups among them. Our experiments are aimed at investigating the effect of explicit attitude features (SD and SE) in comparison with implicit feature (IA) and how they perform when combined. So the experimental conditions are: the three features in isolation, each of the explicit features SD and SE together with IA, and then all three features together.
SWD-BASE: As a baseline, we employ a simple word frequency based model to capture topic dis-tribution, Surface Word Distribution (SWD). SWD is still topic modeling in the vector space, but the di-mensions of the vectors are the frequencies of all the unique words used by the discussant in question.
RAND-BASE: We also apply a very simple base-line using random assignment of discussants to groups, however the number of clusters is deter-mined by the rule of thumb described in Section 3.3.
Three metrics are used for evaluation, as de-scribed in (Manning et al., 2008): Purity, Entropy and F-measure. Table 4 shows the results of the 9 experimental conditions. The following observa-tions can be made: All the individual conditions SD, SE and IA clearly outperform SWD-BASE. All the experimental conditions outperform RAND-BASE which indicates that using clustering is contributing positively to the problem. SE performs worse than SD across both datasets CD and WIKI. This may be due to two reasons: Firstly, since the problem is of clustering the discussant space, SD should be a better indicator than SE. Secondly, as seen from the comparison in Table 5, there are more polarized sentences indicating SD than SE. IA clearly outper-forms SD, SE and SD+SE in the case of WIKI. In Table 5: Statistics of the Attitudinal Sentences per each Thread in the two data sets the case of CD, it is exactly the opposite. This is an interesting result and we believe it is mainly due to the genre of the data. Explicit expression of senti-ment usually increases with the increase in the in-formal nature of discussions. Hence IA is more use-ful in WIKI which is more formal compared to CD, where there is less overt sentiment expression. We note the same trend with the SWD-BASE where per-formance on WIKI is much better than its perfor-mance on CD. This also suggests that WIKI might be an easier data set. A qualitative comparison of the inter-discussant relations can be gleaned from Ta-ble 5. There is significantly more negative language than positive language in CD when compared with the ratios of negative to positive language in WIKI, which are almost the same. The best results over-all are yielded from the combination of IA with SD and SE, the implicit and explicit features together for both data sets, which suggests that Implicit and ex-plicit attitude features complement each other cap-turing more information than each of them individ-ually.
We proposed the use of LDA based topic mod-eling as an implicit agreement feature for the task of identifying similar attitudes in online discussions. We specifically applied latent modeling to the prob-lem of sub-group detection. We compared this with explicit sentiment features in different genres both in isolation and in combination. We highlighted the difference in genre in the datasets and the necessity for capturing different forms of information from them for the task at hand. The best yielding con-dition in both the dat sets combines implicit and ex-plicit features suggesting that there is a complemen-tarity between the two tpes of feaures.
