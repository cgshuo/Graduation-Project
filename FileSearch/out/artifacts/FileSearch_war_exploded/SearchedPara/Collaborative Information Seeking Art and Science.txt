 Traditional IR techniques, systems, and methods that as-sume an individual searcher are often shown to be inade-quate for addressing search problems that are multi-faceted and/or too complex or difficult for individuals. The next big leap in information seeking/retrieval could happen by considering social and collaborative aspects of search. In this half-day tutorial, this concept, along with some of the foundational works and latest developments in the field of collaborative information seeking (CIS) will be presented. Specifically, the course will introduce the student to the-ories, methodologies, and tools that focus on information retrieval/seeking in collaboration. The student will have an opportunity to learn about the social aspect of IR with a fo-cus on collaborative search or CIS situations, systems, and evaluation techniques. The three hours will be divided as: (1) introduction to group-based IR models, approaches, and systems; (2) back-end of CIS systems with system-focused mediation and front-end with user-focused mediation; and (3) evaluation of CIS systems/approaches, prediction and recommendations with collaborative aspects of IR, and fu-ture directions. The attendees will be given a course-pack that will include a reference list, an annotated bibliography of seminal works in the field, and depictions of relevant mod-els/frameworks.
 Length : Half day (3 hours) Target Audience : Those interested in social and collabo-rative aspects of IR (from both academia and industry) Prerequisite : A general understanding of web services, IR systems, and content analysis collaboration.
The course will introduce the student to theories, method-ologies, and tools that focus on information retrieval/seeking in collaboration. The student will have an opportunity to learn about the social aspect of IR with a focus on collabo-rative search or collaborative information seeking (CIS) sit-uations, systems, and evaluation techniques.

Traditionally, IR is considered an individual pursuit, and not surprisingly, the majority of tools, techniques, and mod-els developed for addressing information need, retrieval, and usage have focused on single users. The assumption of in-formation seekers being independent and IR problem being individual has been challenged often in the recent past. This course will introduce such works to the students, with an emphasis on understanding models and systems that sup-port collaborative search or browsing. To put CIS in per-spective, the course will show the students how various re-lated concepts, such as collaborative information behavior (CIB), co-browsing, co-search, collaborative filtering, can be placed on the dimensions of human-system and explicitness-implicitness along with CIS and CIR (Figure 1) for explo-ration and developmental needs, as well as evaluation pur-poses.

Specifically, the course will (1) outline the research and latest developments in the field of collaborative IR, (2) list the challenges for designing and evaluating collaborative IR systems, and (3) show how traditional single user IR models and systems could be mapped to those for CIS. This will be achieved through introduction to appropriate literature, algorithms and interfaces that facilitate CIS, and method-ologies for studying and evaluating them. Thus, the course will offer a balance between theoretical and practical ele-ments of CIS.
The three-hour course will follow a general structure given below.
Following is a more detailed outline of the tutorial presen-tation. 1. Collaboration -what and why 2. Defining collaboration -definitions from literature and Figure 3: An example of an evaluation framework for collaborative search. 11. Creating synergic solutions for CIS 12. Applications of CIS 13. Future directions for research and development
Course materials will be made available on a Web site hosted under http://collab.infoseeking.org/ two weeks prior to the tutorial. They will include links to relevant soft-ware; links to publications that will be discussed; and mech-anisms for communication (Twitter hashtags, blog space, etc.) among the tutorial participants, before, during and after the tutorial.

Since this course is focused on introducing several relevant theories, models, approaches, and findings in the field of CIS/CIR, the participants will also be given an annotated bibliography that represents seminal works in this area.
