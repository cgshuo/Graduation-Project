 international, federal, state, local, and tribal agenci es, as well as other private or public organizations. The essential problem with adequately addressing these fa ctors, despite the many a dvancements made in the past decade, is twofold. First, it is not so much the mass but rather the diffuse nature and complexity of the data, information, and knowledge required for unders tanding terrorism and accounting for the manifold consequences of disasters that make possession of the right knowledge difficult. And, second, that diffuseness and complexity is magnified by the extr eme diversity and wide distribution of the many potential homeland security collaborators. Retrospec tive analysis, and even knowledge discovery, is less useful under these conditions than pros pective, real-time synthesis of information for multiple users. Also, techniques for information retrieval, and knowledge mana gement must take advantage of such technologies as semantic nets, visualization, a nd discrete mathematics to build know ledge systems capable for homeland security applications.
