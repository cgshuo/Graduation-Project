 1.Introduction
The number of images being stored in the Internet is increasing due to an increase in affordable digital ing images from a database becomes more important.

There are three kinds of image database: feature type, sensitiveness type, and metadata type. Feature case of sensitive type ( Kimoto, 1999 ) the user inputs sensitive words and the system exchanges them for digits. In order to search the database the user has to use the corresponding metadata tag.
For the purpose of this study we focused on metadata image databases. In order to create a metadata the database administrator needs to attach the metadata to images within the database. It is only at this point that a user hoping to retrieve images can do so by entering the appropriate terms. The database is searched using the users search term and cross-checked against the metadata issued by the administrator. Examples of metadata are keywords, text, classification items and so on.

There are now accepted ISO (International Standards Organization) regulations governing the structure contents description of metadata for multimedia known as MPEG-7 ( MPEG, 2001 ). MPEG stands for  X  X  X otion Picture Expert Group X  X  although MPEG-7 puts little emphasis on the description of contents 2.Thepurposeofourresearch
Over the past years a considerable number of studies have been conducted on information retrieval stud-lysis of logs. More recently there has been a new method proposed for assessing information searching information not image based information. The Internet is rapidly expanding and the number of stored images from a database have become significantly more important. However there have not been many study was to analyze user  X  s behavior on image retrieval tasks. 3.Method 3.1. Participants
Twenty undergraduate students participated in this study. All were accustomed to using search engines on the Internet such as Google and Yahoo! 3.2. Materials
We developed the image database based on previous research ( Fukumoto &amp; Akahori, 2000, 2001 ). The number of images in this database was 1700 with the contents being varied. The design of the system can be seen in Fig. 1 with Apache, PHP3, PostgreSQL and a retriever accesses it with web browser. The size of image is 200  X  133 (thumbnail) and 600  X  400 (original, it is showed when a retriever magnifies). There are 20 images per one page. A retriever can change 5,10,15,20 with pull down menu. Cache files of browser are deleted every task. 3.3. Procedure
Subjects were shown an image and asked to retrieve it so that they could become accustomed to the sys-were labeled Task 1-1 and Task 1-2, respectively. We then issued instructions Task 2-1 and Task 2-2 to the subjects asking them to search for images that would be suitable for a  X  X  X ummer Greetings Card X  X  and  X  X  X avorite Landscape X  X  respectively and to retrieve an image/s from the database. We did not impose a time labeled Task 2. During both tasks subject  X  s behavior was recorded on video. 4.Results 4.1. Categorization of actions tion method for Web Search behavior ( Miura &amp; Fujiwara, 2001 ), the main features being (1) Keyword Keyword operation occupied from 40% to 50% of the subjects time. In contrast during subjects Web search,
Web page operations occupied about 40% of subjects time. Keyword operations on all Input tasks occupied add, delete or replace actions. Subjects tended to act as follows: first, to input one or two keywords one ( Miura &amp; Fujiwara, 2001 ). 4.2. Process of search
Table 2 shows the ratio of subjects  X  search processes, that is, page, action, time, and average time per action. We counted the averages for each process and examined the differences between all tasks.
The result of t -test found that three processes, Pages, Actions, and Time for Task2 were significantly more used than those on Task1-1 and Task1-2 [ df = (19), t -value = 3.27,4.83,4.90 p = .01]. But there are 2-1 and Task2-2 were based on open task questions and subjects were able to choose whatever images they search database for suitable images.

For set actions such as inputting a keyword or going back to a previous page no significant time differ-not dependent on the task but is instead a personal characteristic. 4.3. Keywords of search
Table 3 shows the ratio of subjects  X  keyword operations, that is, the number of input keywords, the num-ber of unique keywords, and the depth of the AND operation. We counted the averages for each process and looked to see if there were any significant differences between the tasks.

Two operations, inputting and uniqueness at Task2-1and Task2-2 are significantly more used than that of Task1-1 and Task1-2 at 1% level. And Task1-1 is no significant difference from Task1-2. But Task2-1 is hit upon keywords and input them than Task2-1 for subjects in familiarity with this theme (Favorite Land-scape). However there were no significant differences found for the fixed depth of the AND operation for either condition or between subjects. 5.Discussion
There are two kinds of processes described on Table 1 . One is a search function that is keyword oper-ations such as input, add, delete and replace; the other is browse, that being Web-page operations and browser operations such as magnify, forward, back and so on. According to Table 1 , the ratio of these two processes for Task1-1 and Task1-2 is 6:4, and for Task2-1, 4:6 Task2-2, 5:5. Task1-1 and Task1-2 were closed task questions so the search strategy used was more important relative to browsing. In contrast,
Task2-1 and Task2-2 were the reverse of this situation with browsing being more important that the search strategy.

A lot of processes, Pages, Actions, Time, Inputting keywords and Keyword uniqueness for Task 2 were found to differ significantly when compared to the same processes in Task1-1 and Task1-2. We believe that whereas in Task 1-1 and Task 1-2 subjects were presented with a closed task question that resulted in them having to retrieve specific images and not ones they thought best fit the experimenters instructions.
These findings suggest that subjects tend to change their strategy depending on a kind of task that was
Input actions occupied 40% of users time and back operations occupied from about 10% to 30%. It was also found that subjects took a fixed amount of time to execute a function regardless of the task and this was also true for their use of the AND function. We believe the findings generated by the single function and the AND operator were the result of the users own personal characteristics and not therefore not ef-fected by the tasks.
 face found on on-line shopping carts. This type of comparison interface would allow users to view at a ing a selection of images before they decide if they wish to revise their search or continue browsing the images they have been presented with. 6.Conclusion
In this paper, we sought to analyze user  X  s behaviors on image retrieval tasks. Users behavior tended to concur with existing Web search research. More actions were executed when the task was presented as an open question as compared to a closed one and these differences were found to be significant. These re-dependent upon the aim of their search. No significant time differences were found in users executing an action nor were there any significant differences found in their use of the operation AND.
This research shows to need a fast-browsing or comparison system according to open or close task. My future works are as follows: With larger test set: participants and materials.
 Developing a fast-browsing or comparison system and evaluate them.

In the future, we hope that multimedia retrieval using metadata will be easier for all individuals. When viewed from an educational viewpoint we believe that image retrieval would aid teachers in allowing them students by allowing them to easily retrieve relevant images from the Internet.
