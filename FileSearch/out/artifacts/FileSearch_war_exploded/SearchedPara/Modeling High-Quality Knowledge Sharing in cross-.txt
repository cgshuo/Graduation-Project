 1. Introduction
Software development is a collaborative process where its success is dependent upon knowledge acquisition, information
Sarker, 2007 ). This is particularly true since the cross-functional nature of software development projects involves represen-
Seetharaman, &amp; Mykytyn, 2004 ). For example, technical specialists, business stakeholders, strategists and brand specialists work together to design and implement new systems. As a consequence, to harness the expertise of team members and to make communication better tailored to the needs of stakeholders, software development teams must be capable of discov-ering effective ways of knowledge sharing ( Sawyer, Guinan, &amp; Cooprider, 2010; Tiwana &amp; McLean, 2003 ).
Nonetheless, achieving effective knowledge sharing in cross-functional software development practices may encounter several challenges ( Espinosa, Slaughter, Kraut, &amp; Herbsleb, 2007; Joshi et al., 2007 ). It has been widely acknowledged that software development projects become confronted with the challenges of managing knowledge-based teams ( Faraj &amp;
Sproull, 2000 ). For example, the software development process could be plagued by the challenges of information quality such as incorrect and irrelevant information ( Gorla, Somers, &amp; Wong, 2010 ). Previous studies indicate the importance of knowledge as a competitive advantage for those who possess it at the right place and at the right time ( Van der Bij, Song,  X  &amp; Weggeman, 2003 ). The competitive advantage of knowledge can make team members hoard knowledge or offer incom-bers are likely to experience tension caused by diverse professional philosophies and competing goals ( Witt, Hilton, &amp;
Hochwarter, 2001 ). For example, shared resource pools, different backgrounds and project roles might make the subgroups 2010 ). The positive interdependencies make them share their knowledge in order to promote mutual goal attainment; how-ever, if the conflict becomes a dominating concern, they may behave uncooperatively in order to prevent others from achiev-ing their goal, since one X  X  success in some contexts comes at the expense of others. As an example, end users desire specific functions to serve individual business needs, programmers focus on overcoming technical constraints and enhancing com-petency of their careers, and project managers might be concerned with meeting budget expectations and milestones. IT pro-fessionals might experience similar challenges within their own teams too; for example, designers and coders may disagree on design methodology, programming language, database server and etc. ( Tolfo &amp; Wazlawick, 2008 ).

There has been a recent research interest in collaboration and knowledge sharing within multiparty software develop-ment teams (e.g., ( Levina, 2005; Pee et al., 2010 )). However, little systematic efforts exists on discovering the antecedents of  X  X nowledge sharing X  in these contexts, and in particular  X  X igh-Quality Knowledge Sharing X , which enables the internaliza-tion of the shared knowledge ( Levina &amp; Vaast, 2008 ). This has resulted in a somewhat limited comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms through which High-Quality Knowledge Sharing behaviors are produced in these contexts. To deepen our understanding in this area, this study is undertaken to answer the following question: What are the underlying mechanisms that generate High-Quality Knowledge Sharing in cross-functional software development teams? X  X 
We integrate Coopetitive Model of Knowledge Sharing ( Loebecke, Van Fenema, &amp; Powell, 1999 ) and Social Interdepen-dence Theory ( Deutsch, 1949 ) to construct and operationalize a model that explains a comprehensive set of factors that con-tribute to High-Quality Knowledge Sharing in cross-functional software development teams.

The contribution of this study in terms of presenting an operationalizing a theoretical model helps both academics and practitioners gain insights into how to stimulate effective knowledge sharing in multi-party software development pro-cesses. More specifically, the model helps (a) understand, (b) measure, and (v) influence and manage different antecedents that affect High-Quality Knowledge Sharing in multi-party software development teams.

The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. First, the theoretical background of the research is presented, and the primary hypotheses of the study are postulated. This is followed by a discussion on the research methodology, data collec-tion procedures, analysis techniques, and the results. The validated model stands as one of the first attempts in exploring the concept of coopetitive knowledge sharing in cross-functional software development teams in particular, and cross-func-tional project teams in general. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. The paper concludes by highlighting the study X  X  limitations as well as pointing out venues for future research studies. 2. Theoretical background 2.1. Cross-functional software development teams
There is consensus in the literature that defines cross-functional teams as composed of individual representatives drawn from various functional units, such as departments or organizations, who possess specialized knowledge and skills relevant to the completion of the project ( Clark &amp; Wheelwright, 1992; Holland, Gaston, &amp; Gomes, 2000 ).

Based on this definition, throughout this study, cross-functional software development teams refer to  X  X emporary work-groups that are charged with the responsibility of completing a development project within a limited time frame, and they consist of member representatives drawn from various functional units (e.g., departments, organizations) X .
The increasing global competition in software development industry has heightened the need to rely on cross-functional teams (e.g., either in the form of global software development teams or collocated traditional software development teams).
Therefore, our focus on cross-functional teams provides a more realistic approach for studying modern software develop-ment teams. 2.2. High-Quality Knowledge Sharing
The extant literature has questioned the simple notion that knowledge sharing is good and sufficient for organizations for achieving effective collaborative practices, it is more important that the shared knowledge be transformed to become an integrated part of a synergic solution, rather than being merely combined or even completely ignored ( Carlile, 2004; Levina, 2005 ).

Knowledge management literature draws attention to the importance of insightfulness, usefulness, and the quality of the shared knowledge ( Haas &amp; Hansen, 2007 ). Information Systems literature highlights the importance of the practical useful-ness of the knowledge being shared in achieving innovative and collaborative solutions in multiparty software development teams ( Levina, 2005 ). Similarly, Knowledge Transfer literature views successful knowledge sharing through the lens of the internalization approach ( Kane, 2010 ). Accordingly, knowledge transfer requires both the transmission of the knowledge from the source agent, and its internalization/ learning by the recipient agent ( Joshi et al., 2007 ). Therefore, the success of knowledge transfer lies in the changes that occur in the knowledge understanding of the receiver. For example, Li and Hsieh (2009) explained knowledge transfer success in terms of the extent to which recipients were satisfied with the usefulness and applicability of the knowledge being shared ( Li &amp; Hsieh, 2009 ).

With regard to the above discussion, this study applies the concept of  X  X igh-Quality Knowledge Sharing X  to refer to the degree to which people are satisfied with the quality of the shared knowledge &amp; find it useful in accomplishing their activities. 2.3. Coopetitve Model of Knowledge Sharing
The Coopetitive Model of Knowledge Sharing suggests that the phenomenon of knowledge sharing among individuals is influenced by the value of the knowledge being shared, and by the perception of individuals of the payoffs that they gain or lose by sharing knowledge ( Loebecke et al., 1999 ). This model indicates that individuals are more likely to share their per-ceived valuable knowledge in cooperative contexts, whereas competitive situations make them more reserved in sharing what they perceive as valuable knowledge. In addition, it is often acknowledged that cooperative behaviors increase shared understanding among individuals, and this is a major prerequisite for sharing the knowledge that has the most innovative result in sharing high-quality knowledge, whereas conflicting interests and tension as the result of competition can impede this process.

Hypothesis 1. Cooperation among cross-functional team members has a positive impact on the quality of the shared knowledge among them.

Hypothesis 2. Competition among cross-functional team members has a negative impact on the quality of the shared knowledge among them.

The choice of the Coopetitive Model of Knowledge Sharing in this study has a number of reasons. First, this model takes into account the mixed characteristics of knowledge, which are often ignored in other approaches toward knowledge sharing ( Dougherty, 1992 ). In other words, knowledge can be effectively shared to facilitate innovation in collaborative contexts. At the same time, the perceived competitive value of knowledge in collaborative contexts makes individuals reserved in sharing the important knowledge, which is essential for innovation. Second, the Coopetitive Model of Knowledge Sharing has a gen-eral conceptual approach toward knowledge sharing, and thereby it provides the possibility of exploring the detailed mech-anism through which knowledge sharing occurs. This is shown in detail in Section 3.2. 2.4. Cross-functional cooperation and competition
The Coopetitive Model of Knowledge Sharing is an extension of the game theoretical model of knowledge sharing, and thereby it is limited in addressing the underlying nature of cooperative and competitive behaviors. To supplement this ap-proach, the concepts of cross-functional cooperation and competition are borrowed from the cross-functional projects X  literature.

Cross-functional cooperation is adopted from the work of Pinto, Pinto, and Prescott (1993) and Song et al. (1997), and is defined as  X  X he degree, extent, and nature of relationships among cross-functional team members X . Following the work of Ghobadi and D X  X mbra (2011) , cross-functional cooperation is treated and formed by the three first-order constructs of: (i)
Cooperative Task Orientation, (ii) Cooperative Communication, and (iii) Cooperative Interpersonal Relationships ( Ghobadi &amp; D X  X mbra, 2011 ). Similarly, Cross-Functional Competition is defined as  X  X he degree to which cross-functional team members have the tendency of rivalry with each other for limited resources and values X . It is treated as formed by the two first-order constructs including (i) Competition for Tangible Resources, and (ii) Competition for Intangible Resources. 2.5. Social interdependence theory
Social Interdependence Theory indicates that the structure of interdependencies among individuals (positive, negative, or no interdependence) determines the degree of cooperative and competitive interactions ( Deutsch, 1949; Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1995 ). Specifically, positive interdependence results in a process of efficient promotive interaction, whereas negative inter-dependence results in oppositional interaction, and no interdependence results in the absence of interaction ( De Dreu, 2007 ). The extant literature points to a broad range of interdependencies such as goal interdependence, task interdependence,
Outcome Interdependence, and resource interdependence (e.g., ( Parolia, Jiang, Klein, &amp; Sheu, 2010 )). Johnson and Johnson (2006) offered a comprehensive categorization for interdependencies including: (i) Outcome Interdependence (including: goal and reward interdependence), (ii) means interdependence (including: task, resource, and role interdependence), and (iii) Boundary Interdependence (including: sense of identity, friendship, and environmental closeness).
Outcome Interdependence is defined as the degree to which individuals perceive that their outcomes (goals and rewards) are interdependent with each other ( Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2006 ). Means interdependence is defined as the degree to which individuals perceive that they depend on the means of others to achieve mutual outcomes, and can be explained by the de-gree to which individuals depend on the tasks, roles and resources of others to achieve their mutual outcomes. Boundary
Interdependence is defined as the degree to which individuals perceive that they have continuous relations among them-selves. The negative Boundary Interdependence would be abrupt discontinuities, which segregate individuals into separate groups. The discontinuity may be caused by factors such as environmental factors (e.g., functional units, environmental closeness) and similarity (e.g., backgrounds, groups). Boundary Interdependence includes three dimensions including friend-ship, sense of identity, and environmental closeness.

Social interdependence theory provides an appropriate explanation for the emergence of cooperative and competitive behaviors in collaborative contexts, particularly in cross-functional contexts where simultaneous cooperative and compet-itive behaviors are highly evident and expected ( Ghobadi &amp; D X  X mbra, 2011 ). In addition, Social Interdependence Theory is in congruence with the collaborative nature of software development processes ( Pee et al., 2010 ). Therefore, this study employs this theory, and proposes that higher positive levels of interdependencies among cross-functional software development team members account for higher levels of cooperation. In other words, positive levels of interdependencies (outcome, means, and boundary interdependencies) result in cooperative behaviors among cross-functional team members.
Hypothesis 3. Outcome Interdependence among cross-functional team members is positively related to the extent of cooperation among them.

Hypothesis 5. Means interdependence among cross-functional team members is positively related to the extent of cooper-ation among them.

Hypothesis 6. Boundary Interdependence among cross-functional members is positively related to the extent of cooperation among them.

Based on the Social Interdependence Theory, this study argues that negative levels of interdependencies give rise to com-petitive behaviors. Both outcome and boundary interdependencies might have negative values. Negative Outcome Interde-pendence happens when individuals perceive that they can obtain their outcomes if and only if other individuals fail to obtain their outcomes. Negative Boundary Interdependence occurs when discontinuities have segregated individuals into separate groups. The definition of means interdependence (the degree to which individuals perceive that they depend on the means of others to achieve mutual outcomes) suggests that this concept may only have positive value (if they perceive they depend on the means of others), Or it may have no interdependence value (if they perceive they do not depend on the means of others). Therefore, means interdependence may not be associated with a negative value.

Hypothesis 4. Outcome Interdependence among cross-functional team members is negatively related to the extent of competition among them.

Hypothesis 7. Boundary Interdependence among cross-functional team members is negatively related to the extent of com-petition among them.

Based on the previous discussions, Fig. 1 demonstrates the conceptual model of the study. 2.6. Instrument development
Each of the constructs in Fig. 1 has multi-item scales derived from relevant prior studies. Two scales were adopted. First, a 7-point Likert scale was adopted with anchors ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7). Second, a semantic differential scale was adapted from very low (1) to very high (7).

Five steps were taken to generate appropriate measures and questions for the constructs of the model. These steps in-clude: (i) creating a pool of measures, (ii) consolidating measures and questions, (iii) developing reflective and formative measures and questions, (iv) refining measures and questions (face validity), and (v) final refinement of the measures and questions.

First, the relevant literature on the constructs of the model was investigated to find appropriate measures for each con-struct. The findings were combined in a pool of measures. The items were adapted from the literature wherever possible. If no explicit definition of a measure was provided in the literature, the original manuscript was carefully investigated. Based on the sample questions or examples, a short description was provided.

Second, measures that were repeated in different instruments were identified and removed from the pool. Measures that reflected the same concept were consolidated by reviewing their definition.
 Third, based on the definition of the constructs, constructs with formative measures were identified. Except Outcome,
Means and Boundary Interdependencies, other constructs were considered as having reflective measures. In terms of forma-tive measures, it is worthwhile to draw our attention to the work of Jarvis, MacKenzie, and Podsakoff (2003) regarding the major characteristics of formative measures ( Jarvis et al., 2003 ). Firstly, formative measures are fundamental to the defini-tion of the construct. In addition, formative measures define, produce, or cause the construct rather than vice versa ( Diaman-topoulos &amp; Winklhofer, 2001 ). They also do not share any common theme among themselves, and are not necessarily co-varying. The recent emerging research on formative conceptualization has suggested a need for increasing the use of forma-tive indicators ( Diamantopoulos &amp; Winklhofer, 2001 ). However, judgment regarding whether scales should be considered formative or reflective does not depend only on the form of the measurement items. The manner in which participants pro-cess information and respond to questions is also important. If participants retrieve material from cognitive structures and
Brown, 2008 ). With this background, a number of reflective measures were developed for formative constructs to ensure the statistical results, and to provide the possibility of comparing formative and reflective measures. The inclusion of both reflec-tive and formative measures helps future studies decide whether to base their evaluation on the overall perceptions of con-structs or on their underlying causes ( Mathieson, Peacock, &amp; Chin, 2001 ). Having the list of measures for each construct, proper questions to capture the value of each measure were developed.

Fourth, prior to the test of the conceptual basis and its instrument in the target sample, we decided to have an initial con-tent validation by checking the model and its instrument in a similar pilot context. Three experienced engineers holding the position of developers in multi-party software development teams were invited to review the pilot of the questionnaire, and note any items that they perceived as  X  X ot necessary X  or  X  X equiring changes X  from their software development experience per-spective. No item was ranked as  X  X  X ot necessary X  X . In addition, three IS professors and three PhD students were asked to assess the logical consistencies, ease of understanding, sequence of items, and contextual relevance. Revisions included minor changes in the wording of the questions and the graphical representation of the questionnaire (e.g., order of the questions, the introduction page of the survey that explains the objectives and practical implications of the study). We also controlled for a number of factors that our postulated model does not cover, but might be important in predicting
High-Quality Knowledge Sharing. These items include: (i) communication medium satisfaction, (ii) organizational impor-tance of the project, (iii) project complexity, (iv) project size, (v) project duration, and (vi) project cross-functionality.
Table 1 summarizes the constructs of the model, their definition, measures, and sources. The questions relevant to each construct are shown in Appendix A . 3. Research methodology 3.1. Data collection
The research model was examined using data from software development project managers in Australia. Data was col-lected through an online questionnaire. The key-informant approach to data collection suggests identifying and collecting data from a person who would be highly knowledgeable about team events (e.g., Liu, Chen, Chan, &amp; Lie, 2008; Sethi, Smith, &amp; Park, 2001 ). Following this approach, project managers were targeted as the key respondents in our data collection. While this approach has limitation, it allowed us examine the theoretical model across a wide range of projects. A comprehensive list of ethical issues was carefully considered before conducting the research. Responses were voluntary. Confidentiality and anonymity were guaranteed to respondents. Project managers did not represent their organizations; rather their responses represent their team X  X  experience. The criterion for participation was managing or being highly-involved in a cross-functional project within the last 2 years. We asked project managers to answer the survey questions for the most recent cross-functional software development project that they had managed or they had been heavily involved in it. The survey questions were represented in a random manner.

The questionnaire was sent through an Email that included the link to the survey to a group of 500 members of five IT associations in Australia. These associations are considered as the professional Australian organizations that help experi-enced IT professionals develop and broaden their expertise. There are restricted membership criteria and the certified mem-ber status within these associations is upon to specified criteria, which have limited the memberships to those who carry a the survey, the survey began by highlighting the practical implications of the study to software development teams. It was guaranteed to send them an executive summary of the study, upon their request.

One hundred and fifty questionnaires were returned (30%); out of these, 35 were not completed, and therefore were ex-cluded from the analysis. Thus, 115 usable responses were obtained from a population of 500 IT professionals in Australia.
This response rate is consistent with Baruch and Holtom (2008) , who stated that studies that are conducted at the organi-zational level, and seek responses from organizational representatives or top executives, are likely to experience lower re-sponse rates, approximately 35 X 40% ( Baruch &amp; Holtom, 2008 ). We received some feedback from the sample population stating that they had not been recently involved in a cross-functional project. Therefore, the eligibility criteria limited the number of responses (e.g., cross-functionality of projects). As a consequence, a number of professionals in the sample size might not have been eligible to take part in the survey, and this has resulted in the final response rate of 30%. Because we did not have access to the characteristics of the non-respondents, this study does not report a non-response test. In fact, the eligibility criteria seem to be the major sources of non-respondents. Therefore, we do not consider that the respondents are different from the non-respondents except on the selection criterion. Detailed demographics of the projects are given in Table 2 .

The sample demonstrated a relatively broad range of projects in terms of project duration, project members, project com-plexity, etc. The sample included both in-house (72%) and outsourced (28%) projects. 90% of the projects took fewer than 3 years to be completed. The projects were mainly moderate or high in complexity, which explain the reason behind involv-ing cross-functional representatives during the project. In addition, a majority of the project managers (67%) had more than 5 years of experience in software development project management. This reinforces that representatives of the sample are mostly professionals whose technical contributions and cross-functional experience are highly valued. In summary, the demographics suggest that the selected projects are representative of a considerable population of software development projects. 3.2. Data analysis
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to examine the measurement model, and to investigate the causal relationships between the dependent and independent constructs. We applied PLS-Graph Version 3.00, which uses a prin-cipal component-based estimation approach to test the hypotheses. The choice of Partial Least Square (PLS) rather than covariance-based tools (e.g., Amos, LISREL) had several reasons. It was mainly because PLS has the ability of analyzing for-mative measures and modeling latent constructs under conditions of fewer statistical specifications and constraints on the data (e.g., assumptions of non-normality), compared to the covariance-based strategy of LISREL. PLS has also much more consistency, flexibility and robustness in small to moderate sample sizes ( Chin &amp; Newsted, 1999 ).

In terms of the sample size, we followed a procedure for estimating the power ( Chin, Marcolin, &amp; Newsted, 2003 ). This procedure takes into account the fact that both sample size and the number of the model X  X  indicators affect the power and contribute to statistical estimates. In order to control statistical power, a priori power analyses was conducted to deter-
Buchner, 2007 ), with alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8 and the effect size = 0.5 (suggested by the method), a sample size of 102 was recommended as sufficient. This indicates that the sample of 115 responses in this study is adequate.

Data analysis utilized a two-step approach as recommended by Anderson and Gerbing ( Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988 ). The first step involved the analysis of the measurement model, and the second step tested the structural relationships among latent constructs. The following sections explain the analysis of the measurement and structure models. 4. Result 4.1. Measurement model
The aim of the measurement model analysis was to assess the reliability and validity of the constructs and their measures before their use in the full model. The research model includes nine reflective constructs ( X  X igh-Quality Knowledge Sharing, Outcome Interdependence, Means Interdependence, Boundary Interdependence, Cooperative Task Orientation, Cooperative
Communication, Cooperative Interpersonal Relationships, Competition for Tangible Resources, and Competition for Intangi-ble Resources). Based on the instrumentation section, we also included 4 formative constructs to represent Outcome, Means, and Boundary Interdependencies, as well as the formative construct representing control variables. In total, the measure-ment model included 36 items. Prior to the analysis of the measurement model, a redundancy analysis was conducted to check the relative importance of the formative measures when used only to predict their relevant reflective indicators ( Van Den Wollenberg, 1977 ). This is explained in the following section. 4.1.1. Redundancy analysis
In general, a structural path above 0.80 between formative and reflective constructs is indicative of a valid set of forma-tive measures, and a path of 0.90 and above indicates an extremely strong relationship ( Mathieson et al., 2001 ). Fig. 2 dem-onstrates the redundancy model of this study. The redundancy analysis showed that the paths between two models of assessing Outcome, Means, and Boundary Interdependencies were: 0.845, 0.704, and 0.829. This implies an adequate cover-age of perceptions in the formative sets of Outcome Interdependence and Boundary Interdependence. However, the path of 0.704 between the two modes of assessing Means Interdependence does not indicate a significant convergence. Therefore, the following analysis on the measurement model will examine Outcome Interdependence and Boundary Interdependence with their formative measures, whereas Means Interdependence will be examined with its reflective measures. 4.1.2. Measurement analysis
After incorporating the results of the redundancy analysis, 29 items were included in the measurement model (reflective measures of Outcome and Boundary Interdependencies and formative measures of Means Interdependence were removed).
The weights and loadings for each measure in the validated model are given in Table 3 . This table demonstrates the load-ings for reflective measures and the weights for formative measures. As shown, all the constructs are modeled with reflective measures except Outcome Interdependence and Boundary Interdependence, as well as the Project Characteristics (the con-structs being formed with control variables). Table 3 indicates that the loadings for all the reflective measures are significant and uniformly high (above 0.70) with a majority above 0.80.

For formative measures, a number of issues were taken into account. Firstly, absolute value of item weight was examined tics for the formative measures were investigated. All the t -statistics were significant, except for Project Complexity, Project Duration, and Project Cross-Functionality, which had p -value of more than 0.1. Third, the collinearity of the formative measures was checked to confirm that there are no high correlations among the formative measures of each construct. The VIF X  X  for the formative measures were almost less than 3.5 with high distance from 10 ( Cenfetelli &amp; Bassellier, 2009 ).
Convergent validity was examined by generating 500 bootstrapping samples. Convergent validity is adequate if each of the constructs has the minimum average variance expected (AVE) of 0.50 ( Fornell &amp; Larker, 1981 ). Additionally, it is recom-mended that the factor loadings of all items should be above 0.60 for an adequate convergent validity ( Hair, Anderson, Tha-tham, &amp; Black, 1998 ). As shown in Table 3 , measures of internal consistency and convergent validity of all constructs were much greater than 0.7 and 0.5, respectively. This finding ensured that measures of each seven reflective constructs (Means
Interdependence, Cooperative Task Orientation, Cooperative Communication, Cooperative Interpersonal Relationships, Com-petition for Tangible Resources, Competition for Intangible Resources, and High-Quality Knowledge Sharing) are related to their specified construct as a whole.

Discriminant validity was assessed by testing whether the correlation between pairs of constructs is below the threshold shows that the square root of the AVE for all first-order constructs was higher than their shared variances, and thus the var-iance shared between each construct and its indicators are distinct and unidimensional. This confirmed the discriminant validity of the constructs, and thus constructs X  measures are not simply a reflection of other constructs in the model. 4.2. Structural analysis
Fig. 3 illustrates the examined model in PLS, including the R -square of the dependent constructs as well as the significant paths among the constructs. There are three values on the link between each Interdependence construct and CF Cooperation. These values point to the path between each Interdependence construct and the three facets of CF Cooperation including: Cooperative Task Orientation, Cooperative Communication, and Cooperative Interpersonal Relationships.

Similarly, there are two values on the link between each Interdependence construct and CF Competition. These values point to the path between each Interdependence construct and the two facets of competition: Competition for Tangible and for Intangible Resources.

The paths are estimated by a bootstrapping procedure using 500 samples. As shown, the R -square of the model (the main dependent construct of the model  X  High-Quality Knowledge Sharing) is 0.646. This indicates that the structural model ex-plains 64.6% of the variance in the High-Quality Knowledge Sharing construct. This implies the satisfactory predictive power of the PLS model, compared to the minimum recommended R -square value of 0.1 ( Falk &amp; Miller, 1992 ).
Table 5 presents the t -statistics and the p -value of each path. Most of the paths were fairly high compared to many found in related research ( Cohen, 1988 ). The construct representing Project Characteristic had a significant impact on High-Quality Knowledge Sharing with the p -value of less than 0.01.

The weights and the t -statistics of the formative measures of the Project Characteristics (shown in Table 3 ) suggested that the measures of  X  X roject Importance X  and  X  X ommunication Medium Satisfaction X  might contribute the most to the High-Qual-ity Knowledge Sharing construct. In order to find the most important indicator within the construct of Project Characteris-tics, all the formative measures except Project Importance and Communication Medium Satisfaction were deleted. The 3.57. This signifies the importance of the two measures of Project Importance and Communication Medium Satisfaction.
Then, Project Importance was removed and another formative measure, Project Complexity was added. The t -statistics dropped to 0.804. It was, therefore, concluded that Project Importance has the most influence on High-Quality Knowledge Sharing, compared to the other measures of the Project Characteristics X  construct.

The path between CF Competition and High-Quality Knowledge Sharing was almost zero ( p -value &gt; 0.1). The extant lit-erature suggests that competition has its unfavorable impacts on knowledge sharing through decreasing cooperation among individuals ( Pinto et al., 1993 ). Therefore, the relationships between the 2 dimensions of CF Competition and the 3 dimen-sions of CF Cooperation were explored.

The path coefficiencies indicated that Competition for Tangible and Intangible Resources have mixed impacts (increasing and decreasing) on Cooperative Communication (the second dimension of CF Cooperation). The mixed impacts of the
Competition for Tangible Resources (+) and Intangible Resources ( ) on the dimensions of CF Cooperation suggest that the non-significant impact of CF Competition on High-Quality Knowledge Sharing can be due to the neutralized impacts of Competition for Tangible and Intangible Resources on High-Quality Knowledge Sharing. Therefore, the relationships be-tween the two first order constructs of CF Competition (Competition for Tangible and Intangible Resources) and High-Quality
Knowledge Sharing were investigated. Fig. 4 shows the examined model. The overall R -square value of the model increased to 0.657. Table 6 presents the t -statistics and p -values of each path. In summary, Fig. 5 demonstrates our final model. 5. Discussion 5.1. Theoretical contributions
The final validated model addresses the research question of this study by identifying the underlying mechanisms that drive High-Quality Knowledge Sharing behaviors. Specifically, (i) two forces of cross-functional cooperation and competition are shown as the major drivers of High-Quality Knowledge Sharing behaviors, (ii) the interplay between cross-functional cooperation and competition, which affects knowledge sharing behaviors, is examined, and (iii) the antecedents of cross-functional cooperation and competition are presented.

The combination of the Coopetitive Model of Knowledge Sharing and Social Interdependence Theory allowed us postulate an integrated model, which encapsulates a comprehensive set of factors contributing to High-Quality Knowledge Sharing behaviors. Taking into account a more comprehensive model has resulted in a better understanding of the underlying mech-anisms that produce High-Quality Knowledge Sharing (research question).

In addition, the presented final model contributes to advancing the recent emphasis on understanding coopetitive struc-tures at intra-organizational levels. The findings are discussed in detail in below: 5.1.1. CF Cooperation and CF Competition: antecedents of High-Quality Knowledge Sharing
Our analysis illuminated how forces of CF Cooperation and CF Competition drive effective knowledge sharing in cross-functional project teams. The significant impact of cooperation among cross-functional team members on increasing the aspects of inter-unit cooperation ( Avital &amp; Singh, 2007 ).
 Competition among team members had more complex influences. Competition contributes to High-Quality Knowledge
Sharing both directly and indirectly, through the mediating impact of cooperative behaviors. Moreover, the two dimensions of CF Competition generated mixed positive and negative outcomes. The sections below further describe how the two dimensions of CF Competition contributed to High-Quality Knowledge Sharing. 5.1.1.1. Competition for Intangible Resources and High-Quality Knowledge Sharing. The model showed that Competition for
Intangible Resources had a positive impact (+) on High-Quality Knowledge Sharing, while it had a destructive effect ( X ) through diminishing Cooperative Task Orientations and Cooperative Communication of individuals.

The extant literature on cross-functional project teams indicates that Competition for Intangible Resources is nearly al-ways manifested in political behaviors ( Witt et al., 2001 ).The positive and negative associations between Competition for
Intangible Resources and High-Quality Knowledge Sharing can be explained by two research perspectives on organisational politics.

The first perspective emphasizes workplace politics to be positive for organizations ( Egan, 1994 ). In the context of cross-functional projects, political attitudes provoke the need to enhance power and position in individuals and functional units.
Therefore, cross-functional representatives would be more likely to be active in the process of selling their ideas and advanc-ing their roles in collaborative tasks. This explains the direct positive impact of Competition for Intangible Resources and High-Quality Knowledge Sharing.

The second perspective, which is the more predominant view in the extant literature, acknowledges that politics in the workplace may lead to detrimental individual-based outcomes such as higher levels of stress, anxiety, job dissatisfaction and lower levels of organizational commitment and job performance. For example, individuals in political situations tend to im-merse themselves in their work and be unavailable to help others. Other behavioral examples of workplace politics include withholding important information from others in order to weaken the ability of others to compete for scarce resources and to accomplish goals outside of the charter of the group. Therefore, this category suggests that political behaviors produce negative outcomes through reducing team cohesion and team member cooperation ( Pinto et al., 1993; Witt et al., 2001 ).
The findings of this study about the negative association between Competition for Intangible Resources and CF Cooperation tend to agree with the second category of research on organizational politics.

Fig. 4 shows the direct path between Competition for Intangible Resources and High-Quality Knowledge Sharing is only significant at p &lt; 0.1, while the path between the indirect path (between Competition for Intangible Resources and CF Coop-consistent with the predominant literature on organizational politics ( Witt et al., 2001 ), implying that Competition for Intan-gible Resources has a stronger negative impact on cooperative behaviors of individuals, compared to its positive impact on the quality of the knowledge being shared. 5.1.1.2. Competition for Tangible Resources and High-Quality Knowledge Sharing. The model showed that Competition for Tan-gible Resources had a destructive negative impact ( ) on the quality of the shared knowledge, whereas it positively (+) con-tributed to Cooperative Communication and discussions among individuals.

The extant literature draws attention to the potential positive impact of competition for resources on knowledge sharing behaviors. For example, Tsai (2002) argued that units that compete for internal resources and market share often have a strong tendency to communicate and share their knowledge. Tsai argued that this is because functional units have a strong incentive to understand their competitors and discover what their competitors think and know so that they can benchmark themselves. Therefore, it can be expected that Competition for Tangible Resources encourages individuals communicate with each other and discuss the work-related problems.

However, when functional units are involved in a collaborative project, they may depend upon a common pool of scarce organizational resources (e.g., physical space, equipment, manpower, capital funds). In these situations, they tend not to share their perceived important information in order to weaken the ability of other units in competing for scarce resources ( Shih, Tsai, &amp; Wu, 2006 ).
 The findings of this study draw attention to the fact that different types of competition (e.g., Competition for Tangible
Resources, competition for strategic power) generate mixed organizational outcomes. The ignorance of the fact that different dimensions of competition must be studied separately has resulted in inconsistent results regarding the organizational out-comes of competition. Therefore, investigation on different dimensions of competition and cooperation sheds light on explaining inconsistent results regarding the impact of simultaneous cooperation and competition on knowledge sharing behaviors. The results are consistent with the proposed models of prior research, suggesting that cross-functionality has its potential positive and negative outcomes through the collaborative patterns that occur among team members ( Lovelace,
Shapiro, &amp; Weingart, 2001 ). 5.1.2. Interdependencies: Antecedents of CF Cooperation and CF Competition
Our results explain how multiple interdependencies may incur simultaneous cooperative and competitive behaviors in cross-functional teams. Consistent with the proposed hypotheses (H3, H4, H5, H6, and H7), positive and negative interde-pendencies gave rise to cooperative and competitive behaviors among cross-functional members.

The second-order conceptualization of CF Cooperation and CF Competition suggested by Ghobadi and D X  X mbra provided a better understanding of the details of the relation between interdependencies and different dimensions of cooperation and competition. Positive Outcome Interdependence was found to enhance only Cooperative Interpersonal Relationships ( p &lt; 0.05). The linkage between negative Outcome Interdependence and Competition for Tangible Resources was also found significant but only at p &lt; 0.1. Positive Means Interdependence was proved to significantly give rise to the two dimensions of
CF Cooperation including: Cooperative Interpersonal Relations and Cooperative Task Orientation of individuals ( p &lt; 0.01). Po-sitive Boundary Interdependence (e.g., friendship, sense of identity to team, easy access to other team members) was shown to have significant positive effects on the three dimensions of CF Cooperation ( p &lt; 0.01) and significant negative impacts on the two dimensions of CF Competition ( p &lt; 0.01).
 The significant R -squares of the constructs of the model emphasized the satisfactory predictive power of the PLS model. Yet, the predictability of the two dimensions of CF Competition (0.177 and 0.170) was not as strong as the other constructs.
The extant literature on interdependencies is evolving quite rapidly and there are numerous studies, which have empir-ically studied different types of interdependencies such as task interdependence, Outcome Interdependence, resource inter-dependence, etc. In addition, this study is not the first work, which has used Social Interdependence Theory in software development teams. However, these studies are few in number and tend to draw more narrowly on investigating the im-pacts of a few interdependencies such as goal and task interdependencies. Therefore, none of the previous studies has inves-tigated a comprehensive set of interdependencies in an integrative model. This study contributes to the discussion on interdependencies in software development teams, and examines a comprehensive set of interdependencies in order to have a fuller understanding of the complex and diverse routes through which cooperative and competitive behaviors may be developed.

In addition, this research extends Social Interdependence Theory through developing and comparing formative and reflective measures for the three constructs of Outcome, Means, and Boundary Interdependencies. Developing and compar-ing formative and reflective measures are strongly recommended in the IS literature ( Diamantopoulos &amp; Winklhofer, 2001 ). 5.2. Practical implications
Organizations are increasingly employing cross-functional project teams for releasing software in less time and with less friction than in previous product releases. IT managers are required to engage in coordinating the efforts among business users, IT developers, and corporate stakeholders. This need is multiplied by the growth of offshoring, outsourcing, and global software development practices ( Espinosa et al., 2007 ). Whilst executives may recognize that achieving effective knowledge sharing in multi-party teams is a must, they should understand that the underlying nature of cross-functional relationships is the source of serious challenges.
 The results of this study direct project managers to understand the major factors that foster or inhibit High-Quality
Knowledge Sharing in cross-functional relationships. Our validated model draws attention into the importance of managing simultaneous cooperative and competitive behaviors in achieving ideal levels of sharing high-quality knowledge. Our find-ings suggest the methods of fostering or enhancing cooperative and competitive behaviors and High-Quality Knowledge Sharing.

The final model emphasizes the importance of keeping three interdependencies (outcome, means, and Boundary Interde-pendence) at high positive levels, in order to facilitate cooperative behaviors and foster High-Quality Knowledge Sharing. Besides, managers should be aware of the positive relation between Competition for Tangible Resources and Cooperative
Communication. Mechanisms such as informal communication may be employed when there are low levels of Competition for Tangible Resources. However, attention should be paid to the employment of informal means of communication among those who compete for intangible resources. Notably, social interactions do not always have positive impacts. For example, informal interactions might amplify the beneficial effect of task conflict as well as the harmful effect of relationship conflict ( De Clercq, Thongpapanl, &amp; Dimov, 2009 ).

Furthermore, project managers should consider the constructive consequences of organizational politics in cross-func-tional relationships. The results indicated the negative impact of Competition for Intangible Resources on cooperative behav-iors. However, political behaviors had a somewhat positive impact on sharing high-quality knowledge. Organizations and team leaders are encouraged to establish healthy methods of creating political environments. For example, visibility of ideas, sharing best-practices, roles, responsibilities, and project-related achievements can be incorporated in organizational knowl-edge management systems.

The findings can be also useful for those organizations that seek safe and fast ways of switching from cooperative to com-petitive structures or vice versa across their functional units ( Beersma et al., 2009 ). For example, functional units with the history of being competitors might be required to work in a collaborative project, yet these units will often experience dif-ficulties in cooperating with each other. The results of our study help project managers focus on the elements that foster cooperative behaviors in such contexts. 5.3. Limitations and concluding points
This study offers promise for understanding cross-functional relationships in software development teams. However, it does have a number of limitations that must be addressed. First, the span of data collection was limited to one single country,
Australia, partly because it helped in controlling for national culture. It would be insightful to check the appropriateness of the model in varying cultural contexts. As an example, how cultural factors such as individualistic/collectivist cultures im-pact on the relationship between interdependencies and coopetitive behaviors.
 Second, it is believed that interdependencies change during different stages of software development life cycle ( Andres &amp;
Zmud, 2002 ). The current study, however, targeted completed software development projects, and asked the general levels of interdependencies during specified software development projects. Specifically, we asked project managers to rate levels of interdependencies for the most recent software development project that that they have managed, and not for different stages of that project. Longitudinal studies are encouraged to discover how interdependencies change at different phases of software development (e.g., requirement gathering, design, development, and implementation).

The third area for further investigation would be linking the present study X  X  perspective of cooperation and competition to their more specific manifestations in different phases of development projects. Subsequently, it would be insightful to ex-plore when cooperation and competition are more appropriate to occur. For example, different stages of project life cycle may require different levels of cooperation and competition (e.g., cooperation may be more effective during initial phases of project life cycle with competition following in the later phases).

This study targeted project managers as the key respondents. Although key respondent research has been well-respected in the extant literature, it is recommended to examine the model with the data received from other team members as well (e.g., developers, IT business analysts, users). In fact, there might be different opinions on the levels of interdependencies or other constructs of the model, which taking them into account can result in bringing into attention new areas for examination.

Finally, the R -squares of the major construct of the model (High-Quality Knowledge Sharing) and three dimensions of cooperation are significantly high. However, the two first orders of competition are not being predicted as strongly as are the other dependent constructs. Future research should extend the validated model of this study by investigating the other variables that help predict Cross-Functional Competition.
