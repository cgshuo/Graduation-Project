 Case Study, KDD Application, KDD Process, Knowledge Management, Fraud Detection NASD Regulation X  X  Advanced Detection System (ADS) is a KDD application that has been in continuous operational use since mid-1997. ADS is used to discover and detect patterns of regulatory interest in the trade, quotation (dealer and inside) and order data transactions in the Nasdaq Stock Market and other markets subject to NASD Regulation X  X  jurisdiction. ADS generates  X  X reaks, X  which are significant leads to potentially violative behavior, based on knowledge consisting of patterns representing approved regulatory criteria, and provides these breaks to market analysts for review, investigation, and when appropriate, regulatory action. Patterns are matched against transaction data which has been loaded, cleansed, transformed, summarized, and integrated. Breaks, patterns, and their supporting transactions are presented in graphical and textual visualizations for review and evaluation by market analysts and KDD specialists. ADS includes knowledge management components used by KDD specialists for specifying and maintaining the regulatory knowledge and for controlling the regulatory processing. Knowledge discovery components support two complementary efforts  X  (1) determining how best to detect instances of known or suspected types of violative behavior and (2) identifying unknown types of potentially violative behavior. * process and associated procedures that fit our business and technical environments. Our process focuses on the ongoing management and application of discovered knowledge in ADS. It is a modified version of the commonly accepted KDD process model described in reference [2]. It de-emphasizes automated mining as a key to knowledge discovery and augments it with other tools that restructure transaction data, create new representations of complex sets of transactions, and use visualizations to present both patterns and underlying data to analysts so they can evaluate patterns by examining their results in the detection process. It is motivated by business needs for:  X  Integrated and ongoing detection and discovery on current,  X  Support for multiple domains and users  X  Regular break evaluation, management, processing, and  X  Policy approval and management acceptance of the business  X  Periodic pattern evaluations and updates to reflect changes in  X  Equitable and equal treatment of all market participants  X  Full inclusion of and partnership with end users at all stages  X  Fit with organizational processes for development and introduction, section 2 is a brief overview of ADS.

Section 6 presents an overall KDD process model and section 7 concludes. This section provides an overview of ADS, emphasizing recent modifications. Reference [5] provides a complete description of ADS, including the business tasks, application components (especially the data warehouse, detection and discovery engines, and user interface), use and payoff, and development and deployment process. Key ADS milestones are listed in Table 1 and summarized in this section; details of the features are described in other sections of this paper. market information; additional data tables that represent and store not only the regulatory knowledge (i.e., patterns) but also a complete audit trail of break generation and disposition; programs that implement the standard KDD-process data preparation steps of loading, cleansing, transforming, summarizing, and integrating; data mining programs; pattern-matching detection programs for regulatory processing; knowledge management programs; specialized visualizations that depict market information and relationships; and graphical user interfaces for users, supervisors, and KDD analysts. distinct user groups, each of which may have its own business processes, is responsible for monitoring compliance with a specific set of market rules, and which has its own knowledge base (i.e., set of patterns). ADS began operations as a single domain in June 1997. Other domains have been added at various times thereafter. Adding domains involves development of a tailored break browser, additional data sources and/or attributes in the data warehouse, additional visualizations tailored to the domain X  X  key attributes and relationships, and discovery of appropriate knowledge represented as detection patterns. applications of Oracle 8. This conversion was necessary in order to take advantage of the ability to partition large data tables for performance and to use bit mapped indexes, for selection queries (for detection and discovery) and for ad-hoc user initiated OLAP type queries. In 1998 the application underwent a significant restructuring, with the separation of underlying components for detection, discovery, and knowledge management from the knowledge bases, data warehouse, data preparation programs, and user and system interfaces. This separation was enabled by the generalization of the underlying ADS discovery, detection, and knowledge management functions into a software suite known as the  X  X DD Explorer X  toolkit by SRA International, Inc., NASD Regulation X  X  software development contractor for ADS. Order data was added to trade and quotation data in a separate schema when it became available in March 1999. An additional application, the Enhanced Audit Trail, which combines trade, quote, and order data and shares the ADS data warehouse, was implemented to provide query functionality at the same time; its functions are gradually being integrated with the break detection and discovery capabilities. A separate environment for discovery tasks was established in September 1999 in order to remove complex and unpredictable jobs from the production environment. In 1999 a Knowledge Management Board was established to provide a mechanism for senior management to own and control ADS knowledge. An upgrade to a new version of KDD Explorer with significantly enhanced capabilities is scheduled for August 2000. has exploded. In 1997 ADS processed approximately 900,000 transactions (trades, quotes, and insides) per day; in early 2000 this number had increased to between four and five million, with an additional 20 million order records.

August 2000 KDD Explorer 1.3 Upgrade has grown from just the Nasdaq market to include trades in the Over the Counter Bulletin Board and the Over the Counter market and trades and quotes in the Third market. Changes to Nasdaq trading and quotation systems have n ecessitated changes to the ADS data structures and corresponding modifications to the knowledge bases. ADS stores between six to nine months of market data on-line, depending on market volumes; the database currently occupies 2.5 TB and is growing. KDD application introduced in reference [3] and discussed in more detail in reference [7], which shares characteristics with the problem class called  X  X ctivity monitoring X  in reference [1]. Both these application classes deal with the challenges of changing and time-oriented data pointed out in reference [6]. This section describes the components used to manage knowledge in ADS. It then describes the growth and change of knowledge during ADS X  operational life. ADS knowledge consists primarily of explicit patterns and datasets used for regulatory break detection. ADS knowledge is described and organized according to terms defined in table 2. ADS knowledge is stored in a database schema, restricted to KDD specialists, providing seamless access to the knowledge, the market data, and the breaks, and an audit trail of changes to the knowledge. Because the regulatory function is subject to review and auditing by both internal and external groups, it is n ecessary to maintain a complete history not only of patterns but also of jobs. Some operational metadata is also stored and managed as knowledge to provide needed adaptability Knowledge management components are used by KDD specialists for discovery and validation of new knowledge, continuous validation and tuning of existing knowledge, retirement of obsolete knowledge, controlling and tracking the application of knowledge, and documentation and communication of knowledge to affected business and technical staffs. Each type of knowledge identified in Table 2 has a corresponding component for creation, modification, and review. Use: All break detection knowledge in ADS is hierarchically organized in domains, scenarios, and patterns. Domains cover broad regulatory areas and consist of one or more scenarios. Scenarios refer to specific activities of regulatory interest and consist of one or more patterns, of either a rule or sequence type. Rule patterns detect aggregates of potential violations matching specified conditions, according to thresholds for s upport and confidence. Sequence patterns specify complex sets of market conditions which must occur in a specified time order. Pattern details describe both how to detect breaks and what variables and market data transactions to bind to detected breaks for display to analysts who review the breaks. Any modifications are made to new copies to preserve a complete audit trail of changes. Management: Figure 2 shows the Rule Analyzer, available to any user, with which rules may be entered or modified and interactively tested against portions of the market data. A version of this tool also runs as the Rule Editor, available to KDD analysts, with which rule scenarios and patterns may be entered or 
Domain A part of ADS corresponding to a specific Scenario An ordered set of real world events

Pattern A representation of a scenario in terms of 
Break A specific instance (match) of a pattern to 
Job A specific execution match of a set of modified on a permanent basis. Sequence patterns and scenarios are entered or modified via the Sequence Editor, shown in Figure 3. Sequence patterns describe a non-deterministic template match against an ordered sequence of market data transactions. Since these patterns can be quite complex, their creation and testing involves close interaction between the market analysts and KDD analysts. Sequence matching is, in fact, the key feature of ADS that enables detection of patterns of interest. Use: Datasets define an abstract data layer which serves as the source of all input to break detection and displays in ADS. Some decisions may be made at this layer for performance reasons, e.g. filtering trades by size or late reporting status. Thus, dataset definitions are considered part of the break detection knowledge stored in the metadata. Management: A Dataset Editor allows KDD analysts to define data transformations needed for efficient use by the detection and discovery algorithms. An example is shown in Figure 4. In the figure the list of desired attributes is specified (projection), a source table is joined with summary tables, derived attributes are computed, and filters (selection) are defined. The definition of this transformation is stored in the metadata tables, and, if desired, a DB view is defined which implements the transformation. Use: Jobs are stored with all parameters needed to execute them. During the execution, salient entities found in the input data are enumerated and stored in the run table. These are key identifiers, such as trading firms or securities issues, over which the pattern detection process iterates. Since much of the discovery is the result of trial runs of patterns over data, control and audit of jobs and job parameters is critical to the effective use of ADS for this type of manual discovery. Management: ADS provides job editors to assist in this task. The job editor allows KDD analysts to specify a set of patterns, date range and other parameters of the particular algorithm, and one or more datasets to define the source data for the break detection runs. Salient entities are also chosen to define how the total market is to be broken up for separate iterations of the algorithms. Figure 5 shows a portion of the routine jobs run for one domain of ADS over a period of less than a month. Use: Breaks are detected instances of patterns in the input market data, aggregated summary data, or in previously detected breaks. They possess links to matched input and specific values of pattern variables bound during the match process. Since they are the focus of regulatory investigations, it is important to maintain them Management: These system components are currently maintained via the software control process. However, their storage in database tables allows for much more rapid modification as business requirements change in the dynamic environment in which ADS operates. Use: ADS includes features for break management. A break grouping function allows for related breaks to be grouped for purposes of review and analysis. Break grouping occurs automatically in some domains (in which an individual break represents an individual instance of potentially violative behavior and for which it is desirable to review the breaks aggregated over time for specific market participants or issues). Break grouping may also be performed manually by analysts. Break assignment Knowledge in ADS is measurable in three identifiable dimensions: (1) the amount of knowledge in the system, (2) the amount of knowledge that is used for detection, and (3) the number of resulting breaks. The amount of knowledge may be counted at different levels of abstraction  X  starting from the number of domains, continuing through the number of scenarios and patterns, and finally, at the most detailed level, the number of conditions in the patterns. These different levels of abstraction for measuring the amount of knowledge in ADS are all useful for different purposes, and do not correspond exactly b ecause of the differing degrees of complexity that may be introduced when going from one level to another. The amount of applied knowledge measures the product of the amount of knowledge as by break detection jobs. A ROP is defined as the application of one rule pattern or row component of a sequence pattern to one market data transaction. Figure 9 plots the number of MROPs (Million ROPs) over selected months. It depicts the coverage of ADS in regular jobs running production level break detection patterns. surveillance is being performed by ADS. It is a measure that is independent of the number of potential violations, a desirable feature because a goal of ADS is to increase the integrity of the marketplace, and fewer violations translates to an increase, rather than a decrease, in effectiveness. It scales with the transaction volume and with the addition of additional data sources. It also increases as the knowledge becomes more precise, decreasing the number of false positive breaks generated by the system. measure of system activity and productivity; however, it can be highly misleading if not interpreted correctly. As patterns become more specific, and thus more precise, the number of breaks decreases, although the overall surveillance value increases. In ADS KDD process as stages in a knowledge life-cycle, from initial discovery and application thorough validation and approval, incorporation into the regulatory criteria, use in detection, ongoing enhancement, and, if warranted, retirement. It then describes our Knowledge Management Board which was established to ensure that ADS knowledge is being developed and applied in accordance with business needs. It also describes the  X  X cenario and pattern X  document we use to communicate knowledge to business and technical users. Knowledge in ADS moves through four distinct phases, as it is discovered, applied, validated, and used. At each stage there is a well defined environment for the knowledge and for the process that is followed. At any given time, there are various scenarios in each stage. Transitions between stages require various approvals. The four stages are:  X  Analysis  X  Development  X  Experimentation/Validation  X  Deployment need based on a regulatory responsibility and authority. A scenario of improper activity is hypothesized. Analysis attempts to answer the question  X  X ow can we most effectively surveill for the scenario? X  by determining what data and techniques can be used to distinguish the relevant activity from the background of normal market activity. Business processes, available data sources, and surveillance tools are examined and evaluated. If it is determined that ADS can be used for surveillance of the particular activity, patterns may be hypothesized and tested to validate this conclusion. The development of these patterns involves the typical KDD steps of data selection, preprocessing, transformation, in addition to the iterative testing of sets of conditions that validate that a pattern can be effective. Small amounts of data are used (e.g., a few firms and/or issues over a small number of days). Analysis activities take place in a database under control of the KDD analysts, in which they can experiment with appropriate attribute definitions and pattern specifications. The output of this process is typically a decision to develop ADS patterns to surveill for the scenario of interest. Another output may also be requirements for enhancements to the ADS application itself, for additional data elements, displays, or even enhancements to the pattern specification language. development begins in the ADS Discovery environment. Market analysts with expertise in the domain work in conjunction with the KDD analyst to determine the appropriate conditions for the patterns. Typically, several weeks to a month of data is used at this stage, and all firms and issues are evaluated. This larger amount of data ensures that the pattern is valid across the entire market and over time. During this stage we use the data attributes that will be available in the application when the pattern is installed in the production system. Results are examined and analyzed, and an iterative process of modification begins until a pattern capable of distinguishing the activity of interest emerges. Data mining may also be applied as part of this process to determine attributes of the scenario of interest. This process continues iteratively until the pattern is deemed to cover the all violations of interest number of potential violations with an acceptable number of  X  X alse alarms. X  It is a general practice to begin pattern development with a fairly loose set of parameters as the set of candidate breaks that are generated will be likely to contain all the real examples of potential violations. We can then examine the distributions of real and false breaks as a function of each parameter and determine the appropriate thresholds for distinguishing real and false breaks. into the regular ADS detection job stream. This insertion requires approval by the application software Configuration Control Board because it impacts pr oduction operations. Performance metrics from the discovery environments and analyses such as the result of Oracle  X  X xplain plans X  that indicate how data queries are decomposed are included in the information presented to the CCB. When the CCB approves insertion of the pattern into the job stream, it is given a status of EXP, or experimental. Including the pattern in the regular job stream provides continuous results to the end users who will be responsible for the breaks generated by the pattern. It allows them to evaluate the pattern in a real environment, with live data. Note that at this point the datasets do not remain fixed, so the validity of the patterns in the dynamic market environment can be evaluated. Additional pattern modifications may be made during this stage of a pattern X  X  life. results for at least a month, the domain experts and the KDD specialist recommend promotion of the pattern from EXP status to BRK status. BRK status indicates that the pattern is producing results of regulatory value on a regular basis and that Market Regulation is formally responsible for processing all breaks that are generated by the pattern. This promotion requires approval by the Knowledge Management Board (KMB). resultant breaks are analyzed and investigated, suggestions for further tuning of pattern definition emerge. These suggestions are evaluated in the Discovery environment so the results of the proposed modifications may be compared to the results from the unmodified patterns in production. At least two common weeks of breaks must be generated and compared in order to accept changes to patterns in production. Changes are implemented in production after approval from both the CCB (b ecause the change could impact job performance) and with the approval of two Knowledge Management Board members  X  the business manager with responsibility for the domain and the KDD Team Director. These last two approvals ensure the business and technical quality of the proposed change. A full meeting of the KMB is not required because the need for these changes occurs more frequently than monthly scheduled meetings. cases result which may lead to enforcement actions of various types. Typically, as firms become aware of these investigations and enforcement actions, they modify their behavior so as to reduce or eliminate the improper behavior. This deterrent effect is a key benefit of the surveillance, as it results in a market that is more fair to all participants. As the behavior is reduced, the need for comprehensive surveillance may also ebb. Alternative means of surveillance may also be developed. Lack of breaks on an ongoing basis indicates that the type of behavior which a pattern can detect is no longer occurring in the market. A pattern may be proposed for retirement if it is no longer needed. Pattern retirements require KMB approval. The Knowledge Management Board (KMB) was established to provide a mechanism for explicit business ownership of the ADS knowledge. Since the knowledge is the organization X  X  criteria for detecting potentially violative behavior, it must be not only valid from a significance perspective but also officially approved as a criterion for detection for conformance with market rules, regulatory policies, and management priorities. The KMB is chaired by the Executive Vice President of the Market Regulation Department. Its members consist of his direct reporting managers responsible for the business areas which use ADS and other key staff including the Director of Business Information Management, the Director of the KDD team, the Director of Compliance, and the Program Manager for ADS. The KMB ensures that ADS knowledge in ADS reflects regulatory policies, it establishes priorities for knowledge discovery tasks, it ensures consistency and coordination across domains, and, finally, is the customer for newly discovered knowledge. (By definition, previously unknown types of potentially violative behavior do not have a business unit responsible for surveillance; as the customer for this new knowledge, the KMB can determine appropriate actions and assign responsibilities.) KMB approval is required to initiate work on new scenarios, to promote a scenario to BRK status, and to retire a scenario. was established in mid-1999. We initially thought that it would be used solely in a decision making capacity; however, we quickly realized that it was an effective knowledge distribution channel as well. For this reason, we implemented a standing procedure whereby one domain of ADS is reviewed in detail at each meeting. This review includes the regulatory actions resulting from each of the scenarios and establishment of priorities for future efforts. Because ADS is used and enhanced on a regular basis, weekly meetings are conducted with each domain team. The KDD analyst with primary responsibility for the domain conducts the meeting. These meetings are the primary setting at which the iterative discovery process is conducted. The domain team and the KDD specialist jointly review breaks and analyze the effects of pattern conditions and parameters on the quality of the breaks. They determine when patterns are ready for transition between stages and make recommendations to the appropriate approval authority. Meeting discussions are documented so as to have a record of all discussions and the rationale for recommendations. These meetings are also used to communicate regulatory actions being undertaken as a result of ADS breaks, to perform detailed requirements analysis for new data elements or software, and to update users on programmatic concerns and issues. While the business users of the knowledge contained in ADS are the analysts, attorneys, and managers in the Market Regulation Department of NASD Regulation, there are many others who are impacted by it. In order to communicate the regulatory knowledge to affected parties, a single document called the ADS Scenario and Pattern (S&amp;P) document has been created. It is produced and maintained by the KDD team. It is also useful for describing the ADS knowledge from different perspectives than a simple printing out of the patterns in their formal representation. The S&amp;P document supplements our software artifacts. The business objective, scenario description, and pattern change histories are used by the KMB and other business analysts. Ideas for tuning and future development are used to set work priorities. Technical staff use the lists of data sources and bound variables to determine impacts of changes to data elements on the patterns and of patterns on displays and downstream systems. Planned improvements to the scenario and pattern document will include performance analyses of patterns and business results from the patterns. Because scenarios and patterns are updated continually, the document is issued on a regular schedule. Between formal versions, a working copy is updated as n ecessary. Standard subsections corresponding to the scenario and pattern lifecycle in ADS are included for each scenario. Subsections corresponding to a scenario that has not yet r eached a particular point in the lifecycle are simply not present. Key milestones in the scenario/pattern lifecycle are also tracked in the S&amp;P document. Because of the organization of the business users of ADS, the two level structure of domains and scenarios is appropriate. The contents of the document reflect the needs of its users  X  when a need is identified by a particular group for information about ADS scenarios and patterns, a subsection is added to the S&amp;P document to meet that need. Having a single document with all relevant information instead of a set of potentially overlapping documents, each of which is customized to a particular audience, is easier to create and maintain, and requires only that when a particular audience for the document reviews it that they focus only on the sections of interest to them. Since the document is maintained electronically, this cost is minimal. Because ADS knowledge is used in a regular pr oduction application, processes for managing it must correspond to processes used to manage software and operate our information processing systems. This section discusses impacts to our information systems and processes resulting from the use of ADS. The ADS application is managed according to NASD X  X  software engineering processes. These include processes for system development, system changes, and system operations. The knowledge discovery and management functions in ADS must function in conjunction with these software engineering processes. Results of the analysis phase of the knowledge management process may provide inputs to the software development processes as requirements for changes to the detection or discovery engines or the knowledge management components or as requirements for data loading, cleansing, integration, summarization or transformation. Pattern changes, including especially introduction of new patterns to the production environment, b ecause they impact pr oduction capacity (storage and processing), require software configuration control board approval. Conversely, the knowledge management processes are dependent on and constrained by the software processes in terms of the available resources, operational constraints on job scheduling, backups, archiving, and maintenance, and by the available indexes and views of the database. In general, it is beneficial for us to be able to manage ADS as a knowledge-based system using the responsive knowledge management processes in order to meet business needs for flexibility and response. However, when performance considerations take precedence over flexibility and adaptability, implementing a specific feature by computing an attribute as part of the data preparation or transformation is more efficient. conducted by the Quality Control staff to ensure that various functions still operate as they should. For the detection jobs, it is necessary to maintain a fixed set of data with known results to use for the regression testing in order to ensure not only that unmodified patterns still execute but also that they provide the same results on the same data. When ADS was designed and first deployed, it was anticipated that the same database instance would serve to support discovery and detection operations. In fact, ADS contains functions for  X  X romoting X  discovered patterns into the regular detection stream on either an individual or organizational basis. However, the processing capacity needed for complex analytical queries generated by automated data mining or even by manual experimentation with patterns was so significant that it could not be supported in the same environment as the regular ADS data loads, transformations, and detection jobs, combined with end-user reviews and queries. To resolve this issue, we established a separate discovery environment which is updated monthly and contains a replica of the ADS market data. It does not contain the production generated breaks and the patterns; rather, it has versions of patterns and breaks that result from the pattern development step in the knowledge management process. Because market analysts participate so extensively in this process, they have access to the discovery environment as well. We also have a third environment used for analysis which is populated on an ad-hoc basis by the KDD analysts for each project. most recent market data which must be selected from the warehouse containing a much larger data volume. This selection of the most recent data shortly after it has been loaded is an expensive operation. This has led to the development of a  X  X reakmart X  which would contain only the most recent market data and would be used for the detection jobs only. After the detection jobs are run against the breakmart data, it would be emptied and updated with new data. The patterns that are used against the breakmart would be those in the permanent data tables and the breaks would be stored back into the permanent tables as well. ADS was originally conceived as a system with no downstream dependencies. However, since it became operational, a  X  X eport card X  containing various market participant statistics has been developed. Included in these statistics are ADS breaks for some scenarios and domains. This has led to two types of dependencies: system-level and knowledge-level. At the system level, we must be careful when changing patterns whose breaks are included in the report card so as not to alter bound variables or other parameters which determine inclusion. At the knowledge level, a more subtle tradeoff has arisen. When we improve a pattern, a discontinuity in the number of breaks can result. This may cause report card users to misinterpret the reported results. This section presents the overall ADS KDD process model. It modifies and augments the commonly accepted KDD process model described in reference [2], shown in modified form as figure 11. Modifications are: explicit recognition of multiple data sources and an associated integration step, removal of a data selection step (since we do not sample), specialization of the preprocessing and transformation operations, and addition of manual discovery with background knowledge to automated mining for pattern development. model depicted in figure 11 for detection and discovery purposes. It consists of two linked iterative loops which share common elements. Common elements in the two loops are identical, but are depicted twice for clarity. The first loop describes the knowledge discovery aspects of pattern development (i.e., the development and validation stages discussed in section 4.1) and the second loop the knowledge application aspects of break detection (i.e., the deployment stage). The discovery loop is depicted in figure 12 and the detection loop in figure 13. Steps added to figure 11 are outlined in bold. The loops interact at two key points, which are those for which KMB approval is required: (1) approved patterns which result from the discovery loop are inserted into the detection loop and (2) business needs identified in the detection loop initiate work in the discovery loop. The discovery loop also interacts with the software engineering processes. between the discovery and detection functions which supports the continuous execution of both discovery and detection processes, the feedback to the software development process from the knowledge discovery process, and the use of the results of the software development process for the knowledge discovery process. It incorporates management reviews of discovered knowledge to ensure compliance with policies and priorities in addition to statistical validity. It explicitly evaluates discovered knowledge in terms of its use in a production system. It relies on available background knowledge and on tools which query and evaluate highly structured representations rather than on data mining algorithms which typically recognize only records and attributes. Our process does depend on the usual steps of data preparation and transformation to be a success, as well as on an extensive evaluation step. Most important, it retains and depends on the interactive and iterative nature of KDD. ADS is a business success at NASD Regulation. It has significantly increased the effectiveness of the comprehensive surveillance of the Nasdaq Market from multiple perspectives and enabled the Market Regulation Department to perform better its functions thoroughly and effectively. ADS has required changes in business and technology processes b ecause it makes our regulatory knowledge explicit and not only provides the opportunity for but also the n ecessity to manage and use our comprehensively. The integrated discovery and detection components in ADS provide the ability to make our regulatory criteria more effective at distinguishing activity of true regulatory interest from normal market activity. The ultimate measure of success of ADS is the effectiveness of the resultant regulatory actions taken, available at www.nasdr.com. inductive knowledge, concentrating on the validation and verification issues of managing statistical significance and inductive bias when KDD is applied over time. We have addressed the problem from a different perspective  X  that of its use in a large, regulatory organization in multiple domains. Incorporating its proposals for tracking the identity of data samples used and the candidate models considered in the inductive process into our business driven processes would be a further step forward in practical applications of scientifically-based KDD methods. for more thorough integration of KDD groups with business users on a continuing basis. It suggests that as KDD becomes an integral part of business operations, KDD staff are needed on an ongoing (as opposed to a project) basis to work in close cooperation with domain experts and end users. The entire KDD team in the Market Regulation has helped develop and implement the innovations described in this paper and are responsible for support of the ADS application and users. These people are: Henry Goldberg, Tomasz Dybala, Ping Shyr, Dennis Lee, Aung Aung Win, and Roger Brill. Henry Goldberg Department Management who approved and use the policies, processes, and procedures described in the paper are Executive Vice President Stephen Luparello, Vice President Tom Gira, Directors Holly Lough, Jim Bohlin, and Susan Decker, and ADS Business Program Manager, J. Dale Kirkland. All managers and staff who use ADS contribute to the knowledge bases. The NasTech/EDS technical staff who develop, operate and support ADS include Len Gatrell and Randy Klarin and their teams.
