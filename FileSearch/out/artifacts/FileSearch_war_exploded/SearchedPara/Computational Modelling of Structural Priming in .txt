 Current dialogue systems overlook an interesting fact of language-based communication. Speakers tend to repeat their linguistic decisions rather than making them from scratch, creating entrainment over time. Repetition is evident not just on the ob-vious lexical level: syntactic choices depend on pre-ceding ones in a way that can be modelled and, ul-timately, be leveraged in parsing and language gen-eration. The statistical analysis in this paper aims to make headway towards such a model.
 ploited to aid automated processing, for instance in automatic speech recognition using cache models, but only recently have attempts been made at using them in parsing (Charniak and Johnson, 2005). In natural language generation, repetition can be used to increase the alignment of human and computers. A surface-level approach is possible by biasing the n-gram language model used to select the output string from a variety of possible utterances (Brock-mann et al., 2005).

Priming effects are common and well known. For instance, speakers access lexical items more quickly after a semantically or phonologically similar prime. Recent work demonstrates large effects for partic-ular synonymous alternations (e.g., active vs. pas-sive voice) using traditional laboratory experiments with human subjects (Bock, 1986; Branigan et al., 2000). In this study, we look at the effect from a computational perspective, that is, we assume some form of parsing and syntax-driven generation com-ponents. While previous studies singled out syntac-tic phenomena, we assume a phrase-structure gram-mar where all syntactic rules may receive priming. We use large-scale corpora, which reflect the reali-ties of natural interaction, where limited control ex-ists over syntax and the semantics of the utterances. Thus, we quantify priming for the general case in the realistic setting provided by corpus based exper-iments. As a first hypothesis, we predict that after a a syntactic rule occurs, it is more likely to be repeated shortly than a long time afterwards.

From a theoretical perspective, priming opens a peephole into the architecture of the human lan-guage faculty. By identifying units in which prim-ing occurs, we can pinpoint the structures used in processing. Also, priming may help explain the ease with which humans engange in conversations.

This study is interested in the differences relevant to systems implementing language-based human-computer interaction. Often, HCI is a means for user and system to jointly plan or carry out a task. Thus, we look at repetition effects in task-oriented dialogue. A recent psychological perspective mod-els Interactive Alignment between speakers (Picker-ing and Garrod, 2004), where mutual understand-ing about task and situation depends on lower-level priming effects. Under the model, we expect prim-ing effects to be stronger when a task requires high-level alignment of situation models. 2.1 Dialogue types We examined two corpora. Switchboard con-tains 80,000 utterances of spontaneous spoken con-versations over the telephone among randomly paired, North American speakers, syntactically an-notated with phrase-structure grammar (Marcus et al., 1994). The HCRC Map Task corpus comprises more than 110 dialogues with a total of 20 , 400 ut-terances (Anderson et al., 1991). Like Switchboard, HCRC Map Task is a corpus of spoken, two-person dialogue in English. However, Map Task contains task-oriented dialogue : interlocutors work together to achieve a task as quickly and efficiently as pos-sible. Subjects were asked to give each other direc-tions with the help of a map. The interlocutors are in the same room, but have separate, slightly different maps and are unable to see each other X  X  maps. 2.2 Syntactic repetitions Both corpora are annotated with phrase structure trees. Each tree was converted into the set of phrase structure productions that license it. This allows us to identify the repeated use of rules. Structural prim-ing would predict that a rule (target) occurs more often shortly after a potential prime of the same rule than long afterwards  X  any repetition at great dis-tance is seen as coincidental. Therefore, we can cor-relate the probability of repetition with the elapsed time (D IST ) between prime and target.

We considered very pair of two equal syntactic rules up to a predefined maximal distance to be a potential case of priming-enhanced production. If we consider priming at distances 1 ...n , each rule instance produces up to n data points. Our binary response variable indicates whether there is a prime for the target between n  X  0 . 5 and n + 0 . 5 seconds before the target. As a prime, we see the invocation of the same rule. Syntactic repetitions resulting from lexical repetition and repetitions of unary rules are excluded. We looked for repetitions within windows (D IST ) of n = 15 seconds (Section 3.1).

Without priming, one would expect that there is a constant probability of syntactic repetition, no mat-ter the distance between prime and target. The anal-ysis tries to reject this null hypothesis and show a correlation of the effect size with the type of corpus used. We expect to see the syntactic priming effect found experimentally should translate to more cases for shorter repetition distances, since priming effects usually decay rapidly (Branigan et al., 1999).
The target utterance is included as a random fac-tor in our model, grouping all 15 measurements of all rules of an utterance as repeated measurements , since they depend on the same target rule occurrence or at least on other other rules in the utterance, and are, thus, partially inter-dependent.

We distinguish production-production priming within (PP) and comprehension-production priming between speakers (CP), encoded in the factor R OLE . Models were estimated on joint data sets derived from both corpora, with a factor S OURCE included to discriminate the two dialogue types.

Additionally, we build a model estimating the ef-fect of the raw frequency of a particular syntactic rule on the priming effect (F REQ ). This is of par-ticular interest for priming in applications, where a statistical model will, all other things equal, prefer the more frequent linguistic choice; recall for com-peting low-frequency rules will be low. 2.3 Generalized Linear Mixed Effect In this study, we built generalized linear mixed ef-fects regression models (GLMM). In all cases, a rule instance target is counted as a repetition at distance d iff there is an utterance prime which contains the same rule, and prime and target are d units apart. GLMMs with a logit-link function are a form of lo-----
Regression allows us not only to show that prim-ing exists, but it allows us to predict the decline of repetition probability with increasing distance be-tween prime and target and depending on other vari-ables. If we see priming as a form of pre-activation of syntactic nodes, it indicates the decay rate of pre-activation. Our method quantifies priming and cor-relates the effect with secondary factors. 3.1 Task-oriented and spontaneous dialogue Structural repetition between speakers occured in both corpora and its probability decreases logarith-mically with the distance between prime and target.
Figure 1 provides the model for the influence of the four factorial combinations of R OLE and S
OURCE on priming (left) and the development of repetition probability at increasing distance (right). S
OURCE =Map Task has an interaction effect on the priming decay ln ( D IST ) , both for PP priming (  X  =  X  0 . 024 ,t =  X  2 . 0 ,p&lt; 0 . 05 ) and for CP priming (  X  =  X  0 . 059 ,t =  X  4 . 0 ,p&lt; 0 . 0005 ). (Lower coef-ficients indicate more decay, hence more priming.) In both corpora, we find positive priming effects. However, PP priming is stronger, and CP priming is much stronger in Map Task.

The choice of corpus exhibits a marked interac-tion with priming effect. Spontaneous conversation shows significantly less priming than task-oriented dialogue. We believe this is not a side-effect of vary-ing grammar size or a different syntactic entropy in the two types of dialogue, since we examine the de-cay of repetition probability with increasing distance (interactions with D IST ), and not the overall proba-bility of chance repetition (intercepts / main effects except D IST ). 3.2 Frequency effects An additional model was built which included ln ( F REQ ) as a predictor that may interact with the effect coefficient for ln ( D IST ) . ln ( F REQ ) is inversely correlated with the priming effect (Paraphrase:  X   X  p&lt; 0 . 001 ). Priming weakens with higher (logarithmic) frequency of a syntactic rule. Evidence from Wizard-of-Oz experiments (with sys-tems simulated by human operators) have shown that users of dialogue systems strongly align their syntax with that of a (simulated) computer (Brani-gan et al., 2003). Such an effect can be leveraged in an application, provided there is a priming model interfacing syntactic processing.

We found evidence of priming in general, that is, when we assume priming of each phrase structure rule. The priming effects decay quickly and non-linearly, which means that a dialogue system would best only take a relatively short preceding context into account, e.g., the previous few utterances.
An important consideration in the context of di-alogue systems is whether user and system collab-orate on solving a task, such as booking tickets or retrieving information. Here, syntactic priming be-tween human speakers is strong, so a system should implement it. In other situations, systems do not have to use a unified syntactic architecture for pars-ing and generation, but bias their output on previous system utterances, and possibly improve parsing by looking at previously recognized inputs.

The fact that priming is more pronounced within (PP) a speaker suggests that optimizing parsing and generation separately is the most promising avenue in either type of dialogue system.

One explanation for this lies in a reduced cog-nitive load of spontaneous, everyday conversation. Consequently, the more accessible, highly-frequent rules prime less.

In task-oriented dialogue, speakers need to pro-duce a common situation model. Interactive Align-ment Model argues that this process is aided by syn-tactic priming. In support of this model, we find Syntactic priming effects are reliably present in di-alogue even in computational models where the full range of syntactic rules is considered instead of se-lected constructions with known strong priming.
This is good news for dialogue systems, which tend to be task-oriented. Linguistically motivated systems can possibly exploit the user X  X  tendency to repeat syntactic structures by anticipating repetition. Future systems may also align their output with their recognition capabilities and actively align with the user to signal understanding. Parsers and realizers in natural language generation modules may make the most of priming if they respect important factors that influence priming effects, such as task-orientation of the dialogue and frequency of the syntactic rule.
