 of documents and interface visualization and presentation. Indeed there are algorithms relating to these elements, but surely, the human design of interfaces and the representation and presentation of documents are not completely  X  X  X lgorithmic X  X .

In the 1990s, Birger Hj X rland and Hanne Albrechtsen, colleagues of Ingwersen at the Royal School of Li-brary and Information Science in Copenhagen, introduced a new emphasis in the study of information seeking behavior, which they called  X  X  X omain analysis X  X  and an  X  X  X ctivity-theoretical approach X  X . Their concern was to broaden the context of the often individualistic cognitive approach up to that time. Ingwersen and Ja  X  rvelin have incorporated many of their insights into this work, with a broader contextual cognitive framework, and have cited their work, but I believe the contribution of Hj X land and Albrechtsen merits a little more direct attention than the paragraph on page 244 X 245.

But these are minor caveats. This book is a wonderful contribution to a comprehensive understanding of a complete and integrated view of information seeking and information retrieval. All advanced students looking forward to entering the research arena must read it, and those already participating in research will benefit as well. Information Retrieval Design, James D.

About 10 years ago, when I started to teach bibliographic database design and construction in library schools, many students would think that the only technique needed in designing and building a good biblio-graphic database was computer programming, or how to use some existing applications like Microsoft Access,
FoxPro, or DB2. When they took the course, they expected to learn using VBA and other database-related computer languages. Key issues of bibliographic and textual database design, like specification of subject scope and documentary unit, analysis of indexable matter, method of controlled vocabulary management, decision on surrogation and surrogate displays, policy of specificity and exhaustivity of indexing, etc., have never occurred to most of the students.

Today, when almost all the database programs available in the market can easily handle not only metadata records, but also full text searching, retrieval and online delivery, this misunderstanding is even more prevalent than before. The only difference maybe just what computer languages or what information retrieval algo-rithms to learn and use (i.e., should it be XML or SQL?, should it be vector-based or probabilistic-based?, etc.). Not many people, including some information professionals and librarians, understand the crucial role an indexing system can play in designing a good and user friendly database, especially document-based data-base and textual information retrieval system.

Advanced technologies may help searching, but they may also make the right information less accessible, if they are implemented inconsistently or against the principles of information access. James Anderson and Jose  X 
Pe  X  rez-Carballo X  X  book,  X  X  Information retrieval design: principles and options for information description, organi-zation, display, and access in information retrieval databases, digital libraries, catalogs, and indexes  X  X  (Anderson &amp;Pe  X  rez-Carballo, 2005) provides a detailed discussion of such principles.

This is a book about the theory of information access for the design of textual database (i.e., database of messages, texts, and documents) in any medium (e.g., printed, online, CDROM, etc.), and the consequences if certain principles are violated. The book identifies and concentrates on 20 key issues of good database design.
We can consider these 20 issues as 20 questions that a database designer cannot avoid answering in creating a database for a particular kind of information objects. Either one answers the questions consciously and wisely, with solid knowledge based on principles, and hence creates a good database with user friendly features and useful functionalities; or, one answers the questions without thinking much about them, and hence creates a database that may or may not be very helpful to actual users.

The 20 key issues covered in the book cover almost every type of indexing system for textual databases: whether the indexes are produced by human intellectual analysis or machine algorithm; whether they will be presented in printed or electronic media; whether they are designed for searching by human visual inspec-tion or by automatic matching of search keywords. The discussion and analysis are comprehensive and thor-ough. They covered topics like display media, documentary units, indexable matter, analysis and indexing methods, exhaustivity, specificity, displayed vs. non-displayed indexes, syntax, vocabulary management, sur-rogation, locators, arrangement of displayed indexes, and size of displayed indexes. For each key issue, Ander-son and Pe  X  rez-Carballo always start with an introduction on historical background, followed by a discussion on related research studies. They use real world databases to elaborate their ideas and to clarity possible con-fusion. They also create scenarios to provide context for discussion. In addition, throughout the book, the same examples are used consistently in all the discussions, to demonstrate how to apply the principles in actual databases. Besides elaborating their own perspective, the authors also discuss other scholars X  perspectives and talk about the controversies involved in the topics.

There are very few good textbooks in this area one can choose, when one is teaching database construction with a focus on design theory from a theoretical perspective, not from a perspective of technological know-how. Jacso  X  and Lancaster X  X   X  X  Build Your Own Database  X  X  (Jacso  X  &amp; Lancaster, 1999) is a good starter, but it may not be comprehensive enough for many beginners. Before the publication of Anderson and Pe  X  rez-Carb-allo (2005), to teach database construction in a library school, usually one would choose the NISO (National
Information Standards Organization) technical report,  X  X  Guidelines for indexes and related information retrieval devices  X  X  (Anderson, 1997, see also Anderson, 1994) as a reference. I used it as the supplementary text to Jacso  X  and Lancaster X  X   X  X  Build Your Own Database  X  X . The guideline (Anderson, 1997) was the result of the work of a
NISO committee (also chaired by James Anderson), based on input from many NISO member organizations and individual information professionals. It covers similar topics as Anderson and Pe  X  rez-Carballo (2005), but in a highly compressed format, not an easy read for students and beginners.

Comparing Anderson and Pe  X  rez-Carballo (2005) with Anderson (1997), maybe because of the detailed elaborations, we can now see more clearly the influences of some precursors from the area of library and infor-mation studies in the discussions of the principles of information access and database design. For examples, in
Anderson and Pe  X  rez-Carballo (2005), in the chapters on subject scope and domain ana-lysis, vocabulary man-agement and interface design, we can see the influence of Marcia Bates X  works. In  X  X  X igorous systemic bibli-ography X  X  (Bates, 1976), Bates discuss attributes of scope and documentary domain, and also some essential aspects of database design. In  X  X  X ndexing and access for digital libraries and the internet: human database, and domain factors X  X  (Bates, 1998), Bates discusses domain-oriented indexing and human factors of indexing. We can easily find the resonance of ideas in Anderson and Pe  X  rez-Carballo (2005).

Another example is the influence of Jessica L. Milstead. Milstead X  X  focus is more on fostering intelligent design of database (e.g., Milstead, 1984; Milstead, 1992). Many of her points are also covered in Anderson and Pe  X  rez-Carballo (2005). This feature helps my teaching a lot. Since the book is based on the foundations of researches and theories of many scholars in library and information studies, when we discuss the issues in class, it is much easier for me to relate the principles of good database design with the ideas students learned in other classes.

Information systems are getting more and more prevailing and powerful everyday. Many people have already begun to ask why we still need the discipline of library and information studies. Anderson and Pe  X  rez-Carballo X  X   X  X  Information Retrieval Design  X  X  is a good answer to the question. It is not only a matter of efficiency, but also a matter of effectiveness. To use the technologies effectively, we still need a solid under-standing of the characteristics and principles of information access systems. Anderson and Pe  X  rez-Carballo (2005) is not only a good textbook for database and information retrieval classes, but also a good reference for all novices and experienced audience who want to understand how library science is still meaningful in this information age, and to design databases for textual information objects.

The modern society is dominated by information and, as such, the information systems are an essential asset for the success of most business. This book, written by three great specialists in the area of informa-tion technologies, encloses a series of topics on the application of information systems in various aspects of business processes. There are a lot of books about Information Systems and alike but only a limited number of texts that can be used in introductory courses. This text belongs to the introductory type and is a valu-able resource for undergraduate and lower level graduate students in a wide range of courses. All the three authors have a lot of experience in this area and thus are a guaranty of text X  X  quality. The main topics cov-ered by this book are: Information Systems, Digital Economy, Ethics, Privacy, and Information Security,
Data and Knowledge Management, Network Computing, Electronic Commerce, Wireless, Mobile Comput-ing, and Organizational Information Systems. It covers those topics not only from a teaching perspective but also with strong case studies from different industries that can easily be applied in various practical situations.

The book is divided into 10 chapters and two additional small guides, one about computer hardware and the other concerning systems and application software. The first chapter covers the basics of information tech-
