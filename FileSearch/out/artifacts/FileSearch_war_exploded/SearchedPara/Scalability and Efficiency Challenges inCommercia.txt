 Commercial web search engines rely on very large compute infrastructures to be able to cope with the continuous growth of the Web and user bases. Achieving scalability and ef-ficiency in such large-scale search engines requires making careful architectural design choices while devising algorith-mic performance optimizations. Unfortunately, most details about the internal functioning of commercial web search en-gines remain undisclosed due to their financial value and the high level of competition in the search market. The main objective of this tutorial is to provide an overview of the fun-damental scalability and efficiency challenges in commercial web search engines, bridging the existing gap between the industry and academia.

Commercial web search engines need to process thou-sands of queries every second and provide responses to user queries within a few hundred milliseconds. As a consequence of these tight performance constraints, search engines con-struct and maintain very large compute infrastructures for crawling the Web, indexing discovered pages, and process-ing user queries [3]. The scalability and efficiency of these infrastructures require careful performance optimizations in every major component of the search engine [2].
