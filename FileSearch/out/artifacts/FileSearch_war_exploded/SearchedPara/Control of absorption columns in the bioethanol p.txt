The main contribution of the present work is the development staged absorption columns used in the bioethanol production the absorbent flow rates (respectively: water and H 2 SO 4 dioxide gas is supposed to be separated and dry.

The collected gas mixture (CO 2 +ethanol) from the sugar liquid at the top of the ethanol recovery column. The two phases flow countercurrently. A distillation column supplies the absorbent liquid, consisting of water containing some alcohol (around 100 ppm). This first absorption column is composed of nine stages and operates at 40 1 Cand1atm.This equipment must process 61.9 mol/s of gas mixture in order to 200 ppm. The initial concentration depends on the fermenta-tion broth conditions and also on specific features of the manipulated to maintain a high ethanol recovery performance. recovery flow rate could reach 100.46 kg/h.

The effluent gas from the first column, mainly composed by carbon dioxide, a small amount of ethanol, and around 2000 ppm of water, is fed into a depurator to oxidate the organic impurities. A seven-stage absorption column is then used to reduce the water concentration in the gas mixture to 300 ppm. The operational tem perature and pressure are 40 and 1 atm, respectively. This second absorption column is concentration in the effluent gas remains on set point, the recovered dry CO2 flow rate is about 9300 kg/h, under cited operating conditions.

Two control loops are shown, in which effluent gas concentration measurements (AT102 and AT104 devices) are compared to the strategy (AIC) is chosen  X  ANN or PID  X  and the respective mixture concentration measurements (AT101 and AT103) are taken into account in the control calculations. 2.1. Absorption column dynamic modeling
For the computational simulation of the ethanol recovery interpolation in the simulator.

The following issues are taken into consideration for both mathematical models: just one component is transferred between the phases; isothermic absorption; ideal stages; the mass transfer does not modify gas and liquid flows; constant pressure; negligible gas hold-up.

The dynamic model, used in the computational simulations is described here.

When a step disturbance of 13.7% was imposed to the set point of effluent ethanol concentration, the ANN strategy provides no overshoot in contrast to the PID, as clearly demonstrated in Fig. 6 .

Afterwards, a step disturbance of 12.8% was imposed to the residual water set point, for the CO 2 treatment column. The in Fig. 8 .

The ANN controller also outperformed the PID in the CO 2 presented smaller overshoot and the response time declined. When the system was under uncertainties influence, the ANN PID did not deal properly with uncertainties above 5%. For uncertainties. But, when the measurement uncertainties were problem analysis.

The present work demonstrates that the neural controller based on an inverse neural network model is very useful to control the absorption columns studied. While disturbance measurements gave the ANN model a feedforward feature, the the ANN control to act as a feedback strategy. This control carried small uncertainties from the sensors. In summary, by collecting the gas mixture from fermentation tanks and using and great CO 2 emissions are avoided.
