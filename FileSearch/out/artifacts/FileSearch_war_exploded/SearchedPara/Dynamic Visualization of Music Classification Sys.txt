 H.3.4 [ Systems and Software ]: Performance evaluation (efficiency and effectiveness) The traditional approach to the development of automated classification systems involves the optimization of an algorithm development of audio-based Music Information Retrieval (MIR) systems (such as mood, genre or artist classifiers), this approach has tracks whose moods or genres vary across time. Furthermore, the classifications computed by MIR systems are monic (i.e., assigning probability profiles produced for each track. These probability used are well conditioned [1]. This demonstration introduces a highly configurable music overcome these shortcomings by enabling researchers to address real-time music classification and to evaluate the posterior probabilities produced whilst interacting with real-time music streams. The system and its underlying Networked Environment for Music Analysis (NEMA) [2] infrastructure are written in Java and will be deployed for public use under the Software Environment for the Advancement of Scholarly Research (SEASR) [3] web service framework being developed at UIUC. The system supports the real-time extraction of a configurable stream of features from audio tracks and the application of a variety of classification models to short windows (e.g., 10 sec.) of these. The models are used to
