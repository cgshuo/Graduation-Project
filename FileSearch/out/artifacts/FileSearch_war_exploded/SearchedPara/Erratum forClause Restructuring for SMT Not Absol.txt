 We have discovered an error in the experiment configuration files for some of the experiments that we reported in Howlett and Dras (2011). This document first outlines the effects of the error on the argument of the paper, then gives a complete list of the corrections that should be applied. The corrected configuration files have been published with this erratum at http://www.showlett.id.au .
 In Howlett and Dras (2011), we systematically varied several settings of a reordering-as-preprocessing phrase-based SMT system to explore under what conditions it might underper-form relative to the baseline PSMT system. This was motivated by our earlier work (Howlett and Dras, 2010) where we had seen precisely this outcome.
 experiments evaluating on the news test set ( newstest2009 ). This error caused the reordered systems to decode and evaluate on the original test set rather than the reordered version, and thus underperform on this test set. Table 1 gives the corrected results table, which should replace Table 5 of the original paper. The final three columns are the only ones affected; the first four columns remain unchanged.
 our original findings, in the corrected results, the reordered system always outperforms the baseline system. In fact, we find that in many cases the difference between baseline and reordered systems is greater on the news test set than on the Europarl test set, which brings the results closer to agreement with Xia and McCord X  X  (2004) findings.
 spondingly increased. Thus, as in the original paper, the oracle always outperforms both baseline and reordered systems by a substantial margin, demonstrating that each system is providing better translations for some sentences. To further substantiate this, Table 2 lists the number of times that the oracle selects the baseline and reordered systems for each ex-periment. These figures clearly show that the baseline system output is being selected in a significant number of cases. Table 1: Corrected results on news test set. This should replace Table 5 of the original paper. Changed entries are italicised. Columns give: language model order, distortion model (dis-tance, lexicalised), tuning data (none ( X ), Europarl, News), baseline BLEU score, reordered system BLEU score, performance increase, oracle BLEU score.
 reported by the NIST BLEU scorer and the Moses multi-reference BLEU script (multi-bleu) still holds. That is, the NIST scores were always lower than multi-bleu X  X  on test2008 and higher on newstest2009, by a margin of at most 0.23.
 formance. That is, many settings within the translation system, independent of the reordering process, may erode overall performance gains.
 the result in our earlier paper (Howlett and Dras, 2010) that motivated this investigation. We have found that the earlier result is also in error (with the BLEU score for the reordered system out by approximately 0.9), but for an entirely unrelated reason. We are publishing a separate erratum for that work.
 or reordering-as-preprocessing approach to SMT is not absolutely helpful, but with a slight change of emphasis. Reordering can provide overall improvements, but factors unrelated to the reordering process may erode performance gains, and oracle experiments demonstrate that the baseline output is still to be preferred in a substantial number of cases.
