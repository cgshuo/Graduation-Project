LNCS Sublibrary: S L 3  X  Information Systems and Application, incl. Internet/Web and HCI Welcome to the proceedings of the 15th I nternational Conf erence on Web-Age Information Management (WAIM 2014). WAIM is a leading international con-ference for researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to share and ex-change ideas, results, experience, techni ques, and tools in connection with all as-pects of Web data management. The rapid development and prevalent use of the Web highlight the need for new technologies for the design, implementation, and management of Web-based information systems. It is evident that high-volume, distributed, heterogeneous data increasingly found on the Web introduces new challenges beyond the capability of traditional database systems. It calls for new Web-based information systems to provi de effective and efficient techniques for specifying, retrieving, integrating, exchanging, querying, archiving, managing, and cleaning the data on the Web. The study of Web-based information systems requires seamless integration of technologies from database systems and Internet management, and is essential to the development of Web services, e-commerce and e-science, among other things.
 to exchange new results. The call for papers attracted submissions from many research institutions in the USA, UK, Australia, Germany, Japan, India, and China. The Program Committee accepted 4 8 high-quality full papers and 35 short papers covering theoretical research as well as empirical studies. We hope that the proceedings serve as a valuable reference for researchers and developers interested in Web data management techniques.
 express our gratitude to the Program Committee members who worked hard in reviewing papers and providing suggestions for improvements. Special thanks to our keynote speakers, Prof. Jiawei Han, Prof. Amr El Abbadi, Prof. Yufei Tao, Dr. Wen-syan Li, and Dr. Ricky Sun. We would also like to express our gratitude to Prof. Weiyi Meng for leading the Steering Committee of the workshop. researchers and practitioners all over the world, and that it provides a ground for new ideas in this important field.

LNCS Sublibrary: S L 3  X  Information Systems and Application, incl. Internet/Web and HCI Welcome to the proceedings of the 26th I nternational Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE 2014). This year, the conference was held in Thessaloniki, Gr eece. Thessaloniki is not onl y the second largest city of Greece, but also a city rich in history, c ulture, and tourist attractions, both within the city and the nearby peninsula of Chalkidiki. Thessaloniki is located just half an hour north of the archaeological site of Vergina, the ancient cap-ital of Macedonia, where the tomb of Philip (father of Alexander the Great) was discovered. A little farther to the south one can visit mount Olympus, the home of the ancient Gods, as well as Dion, the holy city of ancient Macedonia.

Greece, and much of southern Eur ope, has been in economic crisis for some time. The weather has been causin g emergencies in the past few years of unprecedented scope and scale around the world. And corporations are ex-periencing unparalleled ups-and-downs, which they somehow have to survive. As scientists and engineers, we have a role to play in addressing these crises and in helping societies and enterprises c ope. For this reason, we specifically en-couraged contributions that address some of the roles that information systems engineering can play in dealing with crises.
 standing keynote speakers whose presentations speak to the point. Eric Dubois (University of Luxembourg) is a prominent member of the CAiSE community and a distinguished researcher in the ar ea of requirements engineering. Eric is director of the  X  X ervice Science and Innovation X  Department (www.ssi.tudor.lu), an R&amp;D group that is part of the Tudor Centre. His presentation focused on governance models for service systems. Professor Diomidis Spinellis (Athens Uni-versity of Economics and Business) conducts research on software engineering and related areas. He served as secretar y general for information systems (com-parable to a CIO position) in the Greek Ministry of Finance right in the middle of arguably one of the deepest and longest national economic crises ever ex-perienced. His keynote described his exp eriences in this critical position. The third keynote speaker was Professor Bartel Van de Walle (Tilburg University), a founding member and president of the international community on Informa-tion Systems for Crisis Response and Management (ISCRAM). His presentation addressed precisely the theme of the confe rence: risk accelerators in disasters. a rich variety of topics. The papers were selected using the multi-tier review process developed over the past several years. Every submission received three reviews, and those with at least one positive evaluation were the subject of a discussion between their reviewers and an assigned program board member, using Cyberchair X  X  online discussion fo rum. These discussions resulted in recom-mendations for acceptance or rejection. Approximately one fourth of the top-ranked submissions were then presented and discussed by the program board during a two-day meeting (February 6 X 7) in Thessaloniki where final decisions were made. In total, we received 226 subm issions for the research track, among which 41 were accepted for an acceptanc e rate of 18.1%. Accepted papers were presented in 13 sessions: Clouds and Ser vices; Requirements; Product Lines; Requirements Elicitation; Processes; Risk and Security; Process Models; Data Mining and Streaming; Process Mining; Models; Mining Event Logs; Databases; and Software Engineering.
 ation, Experience or Exploratory paper s. Formal/Technical papers were expected to present solutions for information systems engineering-related problems, which are novel or significantly improve upon existing solutions. These papers were ex-pected to provide a preliminary validation of the proposed solution, such as a proof-of-concept experiment, or sound arguments that the solution will work and will scale up to real-world sized problems. Empirical evaluation papers eval-uated existing problem situations, or validated or refuted proposed solutions through empirical studies, experiments, case studies, simulations, formal analy-ses, or mathematical proofs, etc. Experience papers applied proposed solutions to real-world problems and drew conclusions about lessons learned. Finally, ex-ploratory papers proposed completely new research directions or approaches. A complete description of each category is available on the CAiSE 2014 website. two days of workshops, as well as a doctoral symposium. We are confident that everyone found events of interest in such a rich and diverse program. of colleagues and students who contributed their time, energy, and expertise to serve on the Organizing Committee, Program Committee, program board, and the actual running of the conference. We extend our heartfelt thanks to each and every one of them. We are particularly grateful to Richard van de Stadt for running CyberChairPRO for us, especially so for being both responsive and helpful. Special thanks also go to the corporations, universities, and research centers who sponsored this event.
