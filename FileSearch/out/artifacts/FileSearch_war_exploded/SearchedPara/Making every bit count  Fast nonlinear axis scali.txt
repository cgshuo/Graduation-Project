Existing axis scaling and dimensionality methods focus on preserving structure, usually determined via the Euclidean distance. In other words, they inherently assume that the 
Euclidean distance is already correct. We instead propose a novel nonlinear approach driven by an information-theoretic viewpoint, which we show is also strongly linked to intrinsic dimensionality, or degrees of freedom; and uniformity. Non-linear transformations based on common probability distri-butions, combined with information-driven selection, simul-taneously reduce the number of dimensions required and increase the value of those we retain. Experiments on real data confirm that this approach reveals correlations, finds novel attributes, and scales well. 
The assumption that the Euclidean distance is already acceptable is inherent in most other scaling problems. We instead focus on determining what is, in fact, a good distance function for data; isomorphically, what space is appropriate for data. Motivating this problem are situations such as the following. 
Consider Figure 1, which shows one data set presented in two different sets of scales. The exact scaling methods used need not be specified; suffice it to say that in both cases, the original data could be determined precisely given the methods, and that any mathematical rules learned in either space could be transformed to rules in the original space. 
Version (b) shows a strong linear relationship between the axes, while finding any such rule for (a) would be difficult. (b) is also far less dominated by outliers. Not coincidentally, the axes of (b) appear much more uniformly distributed. For these reasons, (b) is a better data space. Traditional scaling methods would have preserved the structure of (a), thus re-taining a bad distance function. Distance functions, in turn, are critical to many problems. Trustworthy, well-grounded distance functions are absolutely vital -and most algorithms simply assume that this problem has already been solved. permission and/or a fee.

The retained attributes are listed in order of selection, while the non-retained are sorted in order of decreasing value. 
Value on the y-axis is A f, "percentage novelty", which is the estimated amount of new information they provide ver-sus previously selected attributes, relative to the theoretical maximum based on the number of intervals. 
Retained attributes may be surprising, but logl-cal. Figures 3 and 4 show these results. Figure 3 demon-strates a pattern also found in the basketball and wine sets (graphs omitted for brevity); the first few selected attributes are highly novel, but attribute value rapidly decreases until it levels out -perhaps due to independent noise. In this particular case, baseball, the first two statistics to be se-lected, OBA (opponents batting average) and SO (strike-outs). These choices may be counterintuitive, but when one realizes that these characterize the offensive skills of the teams, they are in fact quite logical choices: the offensive skill of one player has little to do with that of his oppo-nents, but many of the other attributes such as the number of hits will obviously be related to either of these two. 
Results for the machine set (graph omitted for brevity) are similar, although the novelty trend levels off more grad-uaily. The first two attributes selected from machine corre-spond to the published and estimated relative CPU perfor-mance ratings -the goal attribute and a linear regression estimate guess, respectively. These attributes are closely re-lated to the other continuous attributes such as maximum main memory in kilobytes. 
Redundant attributes get rejected. Figure 4 shows a pattern in page_blocks that is also present for synthia (graph omitted for brevity), in which there is a significant gap in value between the selected and non-selected attributes. 
The non-selected attributes are chosen reasonably. For in-stance, the most redundant attribute in page_blocks, wb_trans, is actually completely redundant since it is the ratio between two of the retained attributes, blackpix and mean_tr. 
In addition to testing the quality of results, we also tested the scalability. The synthetic nature of synthia allowed us to easily and fairly test for scalability with respect to cardi-nality. We generated variations of synthia with cardinali-ties of 1000, 2000, 3000 through 10,000. Figure 5 shows time
