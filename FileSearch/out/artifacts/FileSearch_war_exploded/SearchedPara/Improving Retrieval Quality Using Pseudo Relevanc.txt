 The increased availability of image capturing devices has enabled collections of digital images to rapidly expand in both size and diversity. This has created a constantly growing need for efficient and effective image browsing, searching, and retrieval tools. Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) has proven to be an effective mechanism for improving retrieval accuracy. An original, simple yet effective rank-based PRF mechanism (RB-PRF) that takes into account the initial rank order of each image to improve retrieval accuracy is proposed. This RB-PRF mechanism innovates by making use of binary image signatures to improve retrieval precision by promoting images similar to highly ranked images and demoting images similar to lower ranked images. Empirical evaluations based on standard benchmarks, namely Wang, Oliva &amp; Torralba, and Corel datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RB-PRF mechanism in image retrieval.

The development of the Internet created an ever-growing need for efficient and effective image brow sing, searching, and retrieval tools. Retrieving relevant images accurately to satisfy an information need from a large, di versified collecti on using visual queries is a challenging task in information retrieval. Despite many years of research in content-based image retrieval (CBIR), an effective genera l solution -in terms of speed, precision and scalability still el udes researchers. Relevance feedback (RF) [1] is an approach that seeks to improve the precision of search results through the incorporation of user feedback in response to an initial results list. When interacting done with conventional PRF. Here we re-rank only the retrieved list of first K binary image vectors ag ainst the generated FB signature. Results presented here show that RB-PRF achieves effective and efficient relevance feedback in CBIR and a considerable improvement in retrieval performance over earlier approaches. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the proposed PRF method. Section 3 provides a detailed explanation of the experi ment and the results obtained relative to published baselines. Conclusions drawn from these findings are included in section 4. Our approach divides each image into a 3x3 non-overlapping grid and extracts visual features fr om each sub-image using global feature descriptors such as colour, texture, and shape. Each feature set is clustered using the k-means algorithm; with similar feature vectors placed together and independent visual vocabularies per feature generated. Then each sub-image is represented by those visual words from these vocabularies through codebook look up of each raw image feature and finally the full image feature set is constructed. This representation is finally translated into a binary image signature using random indexing for efficient retrieval. This process is performed by producing text files to be parsed by the TopSig signature based search system (www.topsig.org). Initially the search produces a list of images with signatures ranked from the most similar to least similar. The top-ranked K signatures are then used in RB-PRF process. The RB-PRF process considers the binary vectors of the top N (size of the PRF list) and the bottom N form the list of K binary vectors as relevant and irrelevant respectively, to generate FB signature . Each selected signature is represented by values of {-1, 1} with 1-bits being interpreted as 1 and 0-bits interpreted as -1. The binary signatures are transformed into real valued vectors as a weighted linear combination of the feedback signatures, weighted by rank (with negative feedback ranked in reverse order.) The feedback vectors are then added together independently and two vectors are descriptors are used in the CBIR system. The color histogram [3] is generated with 64 bins. First order, second order, and third order moments are calculated. Colour coherence vectors [4] are used with 16 buckets. For texture, Gabor wavelets [5] are used with five scales and eight orientations. GIST features are used with eight orientations and three scales as they describe the spatial envelope of the image. The Edge histogram descriptors are using five filters which represent shape features as well as texture. Seven invariant moments are used to further describe the shapes. YCbCr, HSV and RGB color spaces are used in these descriptors. Image representation and searching are described in section 2. The Wang dataset [6] of 1000 images is used for evaluation of the system and for comparisons with earlier work. It is a subset of manually selected images from th e standard Corel image database and consists of 10 classes with 100 images each. For further validation the Oliva and Torralba dataset [7] is also used. It includes 2688 images classified into eight categories. As these datasets are well classified, it was possible to quantitatively evaluate and compare the performance. In order to compare our PRF method with existing baselines that use PRF we conducted another set of experiments on subset of images from the Corel Photo Gallery [8] for which we have results for three earlier systems [8,9,10]. That data set is larger and it consists of about 12K images which are classified into 83 semantic concepts wi th about 100 images in each. These images are JPEG files with a resolution of 120 x 80 or 80 x 120. Even though many images containing the same semantic content are distributed across different Corel categories we use the same set as it provides consistent comparison with the PRF systems from the literature. Precision is used to evaluate the proposed RB-PRF approach. Precision is defined as the fraction of retrieved images in a result list that are relevant to a give n query. Specifically the average precision (AP) at n , where n is the length of the result list is used. Images are considered to be correct matches if they are in the same class as the query image. AP@ n is calculated for both datasets. AP@20, AP@50 and AP@100 are calculated for each class to compare with existing systems. RB-PRF is compared with the baseline signature based system (CBIR-ISIG) [11], and with existing systems from the literature. It may be noted that we do use proxies for both positive FB and negative FB in our approach as described in section 2. Tables 1 and 2 show how the baseline signature-based CBIR (CBIR-ISIG) system performs. Table 2 shows the results of CBIR-ISIG compared with other baseline systems for AP@20 and it shows that the CBIR-ISIG system generates slightly better results [11] using the signature-based approach. The differences are not statistically significant at 95% significance level but are significant at the 90% significance level. CBIR-ISIG with RB-PRF is statistically significantly better at 95% significance level. In addition Table 2 shows the results of CBIR-ISIG system compared with other systems for AP@100. They are not statistically significantly better but averages are higher. Table 3 shows the results of comparing our CBIR-ISIG system with another baseline [12] on the Oliva and Torralba dataset. In tables 500 random images and 15-fold cross-validation. Here images are considered as positive FB (relevant) if and only if they are in the same class as the query image. All others are considered as negative FB (non-relevant). Finally, on the time efficiency of retrieval; the use of signature-based methods, which are designed to make efficient retrieval of high-dimensionality data feasible, allows our approach to work quickly and achieve retrieval times in the milliseconds through the use of scalable signature search approaches [23]. The PRF process can also be performed efficiently due to the fact that the signatures for the retrieved images remain resident in memory after the initial search and performing the requisite re-ranking only requires the calculation of a small number of Hamming distances and a sort. In this paper a RB-PRF approach is described for the application of pseudo relevance feedback in CBIR. The original contribution is in the first application of PRF to signatures and in taking into account the initial rank order of re sults to weight the feedback from each image. This approach has balance of retrieval speed and quality. The proposed RB-PRF approach performs well and outperforms several systems with previously published results on the same data sets. Our experiments demonstrate that the RB-PRF approach is effective and efficient on signature-based representation for image retrieval. [1] D.
