 improvement in technology when it has a virt uous cycle that makes technology improvement proportional to technology itself. For example, chip performance had doubled every 18-24 months technical advancements: bi g data, machine lear ning, and Internet economics. I will explain how we can take advantage of this new effect to develop a new generation of semantic and knowledge-based search engines. Specifically, my presentation will cover the following three areas: Knowledge acquisition  X  our goal is to build a comp rehensive entity graph and knowledge graph to complement the web and social graphs. I will introduce techniques fo r entity extraction and knowledgebase construction thro ugh automatic and interactive mining and crowdsourcing. probabilistic knowledge with a distributed platform. I will focus on technology for both online knowledge serving and offline knowledge inference. Knowledge-empowered search a nd applications  X  the knowledge we have acquired and curated enables applications like query understanding, entit y-centric search experiences, and answers to natural language queries. Author Keywords: Knowledge Acquisition, Semantic Search, Query Understanding.
