 Suppose we have two competing ideas/products/viruses, that propagate over a social or other network. Suppose that they are strong/virulent enough, so that each, if left alone, could lead to an epidemic. What will happen when both operate on the network? Earlier models assume that there is per-fect competition: if a user buys product  X  X  X  (or gets infected with virus  X  X  X ), she will never buy product  X  X  X  (or virus  X  X  X ). This is not always true: for example, a user could install and use both Firefox and Google Chrome as browsers. Similarly, one type of flu may give partial immunity against some other similar disease.

In the case of full competition, it is known that  X  X inner takes all, X  that is the weaker virus/product will become ex-tinct. In the case of no competition, both viruses survive, ignoring each other. What happens in-between these two extremes?
We show that there is a phase transition: if the competi-tion is harsher than a critical level, then  X  X inner takes all; X  otherwise, the weaker virus survives. These are the con-tributions of this paper (a) the problem definition, which is novel even in epidemiology literature [3, 17, 35] (b) the phase-transition result and (c) experiments on real data, il-lustrating the suitability of our results.
 H.2.8 [ Database management ]: Database applications X  Data mining Epidemics, Cascades, Competition, Co-existence Given two partially competing products (like Firefox and Google Chrome; or Android and iPhone), is it possible that they both survive?
The well-known Competitive Exclusion Principle in ecol-ogy states that when two species are in complete competition under constant conditions, the more fit one will eventually drive the less fit one into extinction. A more common but less well understood scenario is one where the competing species induce partial immunity against one another. There has been significant work trying to elucidate the conditions under which such partial immunity leads to coexistence [25, 11, 26] but a complete theory has not yet emerged.

Here, we study the general case of two virus strains with partial (and symmetric) cross-immunity spreading over a fixed network topology. In addition to the implications for the evolutionary problem discussed above, our results have direct relevance to the spread of rumors and opinions in so-cial networks and market penetration of products.

The contributions of this work are the following:
Figure 1 shows the time-plots for partially competing products Hulu vs. Blockbuster (a), and Google Chrome vs. Firefox (b). They plot (normalized) count of Google queries, versus time. We fit our model to the data 1 and plot it as well. Notice that it captures the trends well.

The rest of the paper is organized in the usual way: we review related work in  X  2 and formulate the problem giv-ing details of our model in  X  3. We give the analysis and proof of our phase-transition and coexistence result in  X  4 and demonstrate the validity of the results using simulations and real-world case-studies in  X  5. Finally, we discuss other subtle aspects of the model in  X  6 and conclude in  X  7.
Here we provide a brief overview of the vast literature on epidemiology, influence propagation and population ecology. Epidemiology and Epidemic Thresholds There are nu-merous, well-studied epidemiological models, including the so-called homogeneous models [4, 27, 3]. They effectively as-sume that the network is a full clique, that is, every person has the same probability to contact every other person. A large portion of the literature focuses on a single virus, and
Fitted with www.alexbeutel.com/jsplot/kdd2012.html data. even then, there are numerous interesting sub-cases. Typical propagation models include SIS (flu-like, with no immunity -Susceptible / Infected / Susceptible), SIR (mumps-like, with lifetime immunity - X  X  X =  X  X ecovered X ), SIRS (with tem-porary immunity), and many-many more -see [17] for a detailed survey, or the 700-page book of Anderson and May [3].

A lot of attention focuses on the so-called epidemic thresh-old: under what conditions will a virus (say, flu-like) become extinct? Earlier works [19, 28] studied specific topologies (e.g., random graphs, power-law graphs, etc). Chakrabarti et al. [10] and Ganesh et al. [13] found that, for arbitrary topologies, and for the flu-like SIS model, the epidemic thresh-old for any arbitrary graph is determined by the leading eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the graph. Prakash et. al. [31] generalized this result to any topology, as well as almost any virus propagation model (SIR, SIRS, etc). However, all of these works focus on single virus models.
Recent work [30] looked at a two-virus SIS model on ar-bitrary graphs, but focused on the case where there was full mutual immunity between viruses. Their theorem says that, in such a setting, the stronger virus will push the weaker one to extinction ( X  X inner takes all X ), even if the weaker one would be able to survive on the network when left alone. Influence propagation -information diffusion Biolog-ical viruses are not the only objects of interest that prop-agate over the edges of a network. Rumors, ideas, memes, and computer worms behave similarly and have attracted a lot of interest, especially recently thanks to the internet and the web. Research focuses on topics that include (a) in-formation cascades [6, 14], (b) blog propagation [24, 16, 21, 33], and (c) viral marketing and product penetration [23]. Typical cascade models include (a) the independent cas-cade [18] (essentially an  X  X IR X  -mumps-like model) and (b) linear threshold [15]. Research work in multiple cascades has examined extensions of the independent cascade model for the case that nodes can not switch from one competitor to the other [5, 20], as well as when they can [29].
There are several fascinating, but remotely-related prob-lems: (a) which nodes to immunize, given a finite count of vaccines [32, 36] (b) which are the best nodes to advertize a new product, to maximize product penetration [12] (c) which nodes are the most likely to be the culprits, when we are given a snapshot of infected nodes in a graph. [22, 34] Ecology In ecology, the principle of  X  competitive exclusion  X  espouses that two species can not occupy the same ecological niche in the long term. That is,  X  X inner takes all X , using our earlier terminology. Research has gone into studying this using various propagation models like SIS, SIR, Lotka-Volterra etc. (for example, see [8, 9, 1, 2]). Partial immunity models have received much attention in epidemiology. For example, [25] suggests a differential equation based model and analyzes it via simulation. However, for this and most other models of interest, a complete analytical solution has been beyond reach.
 Distinguishing features of current work : In short, none of the previous work fulfills all the conditions of this current work: (a) analytical proof of critical , the critical value of the competition threshold (b) closed-form steady-state behavior (c) under an SIS (flu-like) model.
In this section, we formulate our problem, giving details about the model used and the assumptions. Table 1 explains the terminology we have used in the paper. Bold letters typically denote matrices ( A , M etc.).
 Figure 2: State Diagram for a node in the graph under our partial-competition model.
We assume that the competing viruses are spreading on the network according to a propagation model, which we de-scribe next. We call our propagation model SI 1 | 2 S , based on the popular  X  X lu-like X  SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model [17]. SI 1 | 2 S denotes Susceptible -Infected 1 or 2 ceptible. Each node in the graph can be in one of four states: Susceptible (healthy), I 1 (infected by virus 1), I 2 (infected by virus 2), or I 1 , 2 (infected by both virus 1 and virus 2). The state transition diagram as seen from a node in the net-work is shown in Figure 2. We could have extended other single virus models as well, but we believe that our model is a reasonable starting point, and we leave the analysis of other models as future work.

Healing (virus death) rate:  X  . If a node is in an some rate,  X  1 for virus 1 or  X  2 for virus 2. The healing rate is inversely related with the virus X  X  strength: a high  X  means that nodes that are infected heal quickly. For example, a product that lasts a long time such that people using it rarely consider alternatives would be modeled with a low  X  value.

Attack (virus transmission) rate:  X  . An infected node can spread the virus to its neighboring nodes, and the node susceptibility is captured by  X  1 and  X  2 . Specifically, an infected node transmits its infection to each of its healthy neighbors independently at rate  X  1 (or  X  2 ). The more often an idea or product is shared with friends, frequently referred to as being  X  X iral, X  the higher the value for  X  .

Virus interaction factor: . A node infected with one virus may be more or less susceptible to being infected by the other virus, as determined by the factor . The transmission rate for a virus becomes  X  1 (or  X  2 ) when a node is already infected with one virus. Specifically, if a node is infected with virus 1, each of its neighbors infected with virus 2 have a transmission rate to it of  X  2 ; a node infected with virus 2 can only be infected with virus 1 at a rate of  X  1 .
This is a novel generalization of the single-virus SIS model to a multiple-virus scenario. The value of can describe many different virus interactions. If = 0 then the viruses are fully mutually immune, and 0 &lt;  X  1 suggests an amount of competition between viruses.

Fair-play : We assume that the competitors are playing a  X  X air game X : All nodes in the network have the same model parameters (  X   X  X ,  X   X  X , ) for each of the viruses and behave according to the state-diagram in Figure 2. We are now in a position to state the problem formally. We assume the underlying network is connected -otherwise we just have separate disconnected problems.
 Interacting viruses problem Given : An undirected connected graph G , and the propa-gation model ( SI 1 | 2 S ) parameters (  X  1 ,  X  1 for virus 1,  X  for virus 2, and ) Find : What are the possible fixed points for the system? In particular, for what values of is there a fixed point for which both virus 1 and virus 2 survive?
For a clique, the following differential equations fully de-scribe the transitions of the system, seen in Figure 2. Here I , I 2 , and I 1 , 2 are the number of nodes infected with only virus 1, only virus 2, and both virus 1 and 2 respectively. N is the total number of nodes, and S is the number of susceptible nodes ( S = N  X  I 1  X  I 2  X  I 12 ). dt
The goal of our analysis is to find for what values of is there an equilibrium point for which both virus 1 and virus 2 survive. We find that there is an critical such that if &gt; critical then an equilibrium point for which the viruses coexist.
At an equilibrium point, all derivatives are zero. Thus, we can find a simple equation for I 12
Lemma 1. The number of people infected by both virus 1 and virus 2 will obey the following equation: Proof. Trivial, given the above.

Thus we have the expected three equilibrium points and possibly one for which I 1 ,I 2 &gt; 0 and obeys the differ-ential equations outlined: 0 =  X  1 S ( I 1 + I 12 ) +  X  2 I 12  X   X  1 I 1  X   X  2 I 1 ( I 0 =  X  2 S ( I 2 + I 12 ) +  X  1 I 12  X   X  2 I 2  X   X  1 I 2 ( I 0 =  X  1 I 2 ( I 1 + I 12 ) +  X  2 I 1 ( I 2 + I 12 )  X  (  X 
We rework these equations to be primarily in terms of  X  ,  X  2 , i 12 , where  X  1 = ( I 1 + I 12 ) /N ,  X  2 = ( I i 12 = I 12 /N . As such, each of these terms represent a frac-tion of the population that is infected. We first convert the constraints to where i 1 = I 1 /N and i 2 = I 2 /N .

Manipulating (9) to remove i 1 and i 2 , we find Remember, because we are working with a clique the virus strengths are  X  1 = N X  1 / X  1 and  X  2 = N X  2 / X  2 .
From these constraints, we look to find a lower bound on , such that for any less competition there can be coexistence.
Theorem 1 (Epsilon Threshold Theorem). Given a fully connected graph with the SI 1 | 2 S model parameters  X   X  , an equilibrium point for which  X  1 , X  2 &gt; 0 exists if &gt;
Proof. In Lemma 3 we give the possible fixed point for coexistence. In Lemma 4 we show the constraints for the fixed points to be real, which contribute to the bounds in (11). In Lemmas 5 through 9 we give the proofs for the con-straints on the fixed points being positive, and in Lemma 10 we give the proof that the fixed points are less than one. Next we describe all of the Lemmas, which contribute to the proof.

Lemma 2. If a fourth equilibrium point exists, then it should satisfy the follow equation:
Proof. Since we are only looking for non-zero solutions for  X  1 and  X  2 , we can eliminate them in (7) and (8). Subtracting, we get the lemma.

Lemma 3 (Coexistence Lemma). If an equilibrium point exists for which both viruses coexist in the network,  X  , X  2 &gt; 0 , it will be at: i  X  1 =  X  2 + 1 1 We will denote the solution to these three equations for fixed-points as i  X  12 ,  X   X  1 , and  X   X  2 respectively.

Proof. Equation (15) is a simple rearrangement of equa-tion (10), and equation (16) is a rearrangement of equation (12). Plugging (15) and (16) into (13) allows us to solve for  X  2 resulting in (17).

For  X   X  2 (and by extension  X   X  1 and i  X  12 ) to be a valid fixed-point,  X   X  2 must be: (a) real, (b)  X   X  2  X  0, (c)  X   X  2
Lemma 4. In order for fixed-point solution  X   X  2 , and by extension  X   X  1 and i  X  12 , to be real valued, either  X  1
Proof. This constraint comes from the square root in equation (17) for  X   X  2 . We analyze the quadratic equation 4  X  4 + 2  X  1  X  2 (in terms of ) from inside the square root. It is a simple, upward-facing parabola. Solving for the roots of the quadratic equation in terms of we find For  X  1  X  2 &gt; 1 there is no solution because the equation is positive for all values of . Thus, if  X  1  X  2 &gt; 1 then  X  be real valued. For  X  1  X  2 &lt; 1 a portion of the parabola is negative. Therefore, we require that be in the positive region of the quadratic equation, where is less than the lower root or greater than the upper root.

To find when  X   X  2  X  0, we consider the cases above for which it is real. As we explained before, we will focus on the lower bound for .

Lemma 5. For strengths  X  1  X  2 &gt; 1 , fixed-point  X   X  2 tonically increasing as a function of .

Proof. Taking the derivative of (17) we get Because  X  1  X  2 &gt; 1, all of the square roots are real valued. The denominator is clearly positive, so to prove that  X   X  monotonically increasing, we must show that the numerator is positive. To show that the numerator is always positive we would like to show that or alternatively Because  X  1  X   X  2 the first term is clearly &gt; 1. For  X  (and of course &gt; 0) this is trivially true.
Lemma 6. Fixed-point solution  X   X  2 , defined by  X  can only be positive when  X  + 2 , defined by  X  is positive.

Proof. As a simple case, for  X  1  X  2 &gt; 1,  X   X  2 &lt; 0 and thus invalid for all &gt; 0. As approaches 0, it is clear that  X   X  X  X  , and as  X   X  , we see that  X   X  2 approaches 0. Since from the previous lemma we know that it is monotonically increasing,  X   X  2 &lt; 0 for  X  1  X  2 &gt; 1.

If we do not restrict  X  1 and  X  2 , it is still clear that  X  for all  X  0, since the last term is always positive. We will see later that  X  + 2 &lt; 1 for all &gt; 0. Therefore, the range for which  X   X  2 is valid is a strict subset of that for which  X  valid.

Because  X   X  2 is only valid when  X  + 2 is valid, it has no impact on the phase transition claimed in Theorem 1. As a result, we will focus on  X  + 2 for the remainder of the proof and, with a slight abuse of notation, use  X   X  2 to denote  X  + 2 .
Lemma 7. When strengths  X  1  X  2  X  1 , the fixed-point for the population infected by virus 2 is positive,  X   X  2 &gt; 0 , if and only if
Proof. Solving equation (19) for  X   X  2 = 0 produces = region (  X  1  X  2 &gt; 1), for all greater than this solution,  X  and for all less than this solution  X   X  2  X  0.

Lemma 8. If virus strengths  X  1 +  X  2 &lt; 2 , then the fixed-point for the population infected by virus 2 is positive,  X  0 , for
Proof. For  X   X  2 to be positive, the numerator of (19) must be positive. We can reduce this as follows: For this to be positive we must have which is true for  X  1 +  X  2 &lt; 2.

Lemma 9. If virus strengths  X  1 +  X  2  X  2 then the fixed-point for the population infected by virus 2 is positive,  X  0 , for
Proof. Again, for  X   X  2 to be positive, the numerator of (19) must be positive. We can reduce this as follows:  X  2  X  1  X  2 +  X  1  X  2 2 + =  X  2 (  X   X  2 =  X  1  X  2 2  X   X  1
Lemma 10. The fixed-point for the population infected by virus 2 is valid,  X   X  2  X  1 , for  X  1  X   X  2 and  X  0 .
Proof. The constraint  X   X  2  X  1 is equivalent to This can be simplified as follows:  X  The simplification to (23) makes it clear that the lemma is true for  X  1  X   X  2 &gt; 0.

As such, for any interaction factor &gt; critical , we have proved that  X   X  1 and  X   X  2 are valid equilibrium points for which the population infected by each virus  X  1 , X  2 &gt; 0. QED
We demonstrate our result using (a) simulation experi-ments and (b) case studies using real data in this section.
Without loss of generality, in our experiments we assumed that the first virus is the stronger virus. We primarily focus on the case where  X  1 &gt;  X  2 &gt; 1. For our simulations we use  X  = 6 and  X  2 = 4.

We run a simulation on a fully-connected clique of 1000 nodes. We vary around our expected threshold and for each value of perform 10 runs over 4000 time steps. On each run we begin by infecting 30 nodes at random with each virus.

We analyze the results in two ways. First, we create a steady-state plot of mean values and standard deviations for  X  ,  X  2 , and i 12 at steady-state over a range of values for . Over the results of the simulation we draw the behavior predicted by our results. Second, for one &gt; critical track each virus X  X  development over time with a time-plot . The time-plot takes the average number of nodes infected (  X  1 ,  X  2 , and i 12 ) at each time step and plots this against time. Although the simulations were run for 4000 time steps, the plots are truncated to give more detail to the initial fluctuations of the virus counts. points overlayed. (a) shows the steady-state population values,  X  both viruses survive as expected.
Figure 3 displays our results. In short, the plots agree exactly with our result, as expected. Figure 3(a) shows the steady-state plot for the two viruses, and the theoretical predictions closely match the simulation results. Similarly, the viruses X  growth as shown in the time-plot in Figure 3(b) matches what is expected.

For the steady-state plot, we expect the steady-state value to be one of the other fixed points where at least one virus dies out for  X  critical and then a co-existence for &gt; critical . In Figure 3(a) we see for  X  1 &gt;  X  2 &gt; 1 and = 0, winner takes all, as was proven in [30]. However, for &gt; critical we see a coexistence between the viruses as expected; this is true even when the viruses are competing ( &lt; 1). For = 0 . 4 &gt; critical we have the time-plot, Figure 3(b), showing the growth of both viruses to steady-state from a small infection in the system.
We collected historical data for  X  X eb-search interest X  for various competing products from the Google-Insights web-site 2 , which aims to  X  X rovide insights into broad search pat-terns. X  This allows us to use the data as a proxy for sales/interest for each product. We used the following pairs of rival prod-ucts: 1. Hulu 3 and Blockbuster 4 : Although not direct competi-2. Firefox 5 and Google Chrome 6 : Two rival web browsers. We consider both pairs of products to be examples of cases where there is partial mutual immunity; people can use both products, but the use of one we expect would detract from the use of the other. While our model does not describe the situations perfectly, we believe it is a good approximation. www.google.com/insights/search/ www.hulu.com www.blockbuster.com www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ www.google.com/chrome
In Figure 4 we show plots of the web-interest vs. time for both pairs of products, along with our model fitted to the data 7 . In Figure 4(a), we used a virus interaction factor of = 0 . 7 (along with virus parameters  X  Hulu = 0 . 04,  X  Hulu 4(b), we used a virus interaction factor of = 0 . 6 (along with virus parameters  X  Firefox = 0 . 01,  X  Firefox = 0 . 000095,  X 
Chrome = 0 . 01,  X  Chrome = 0 . 00015). In Figure 4(c) we use the same model as (b) but let the model continue to see the projected steady state behavior. We note that the plots begin when Hulu and Chrome are first introduced and with Blockbuster and Firefox at a previous steady-state behavior. In each of these fittings we see that our model fits the data well. The fact that the model fits the data well demonstrates the suitability of our SI 1 | 2 S model. Conjecture 1 (Epsilon Threshold Upper Bound).
 Given an arbitrary graph with the SI 1 | 2 S model parameters  X   X   X  2  X  1 , an equilibrium point for which both virus 1 and virus 2 survive exists if &gt; critical , where Justification: Since  X  1  X   X  2  X  1 and 0 &lt; &lt; 1, we know that both virus 1 and virus 2 would be strong enough to sur-vive independently but there is some competition between them. Because of the competition, as virus 1 spreads to more nodes, virus 2 X  X  attack rate on average decreases and thus its strength decreases. Therefore, if we overestimate the strength or number of people with virus 1, this only makes it more difficult for virus 2 survive and thus decreases the maximum amount of competition virus 2 can handle, in-creasing critical . To simplify the problem, we assume that every person is infected with virus 1 (as if virus 1 was in-finitely strong). In this case, a node can only be in state I
Fitted with www.alexbeutel.com/jsplot/kdd2012.html or I 1 , 2 , and the probability of a node with virus 2 infecting a neighbor is always  X  2 . This is now equivalent to a one virus model where the strength of virus 2 is  X  0 2 =  X  2 . Therefore, as shown in previous research [10, 13, 31], if  X  0 virus 2 will survive. In this case, critical = 1  X  cause this is a relaxation of the original problem, we know that this is an upper bound and in fact critical  X  1  X 
We also consider the example of educational ideas, and specifically sex education, as a virus. Sociology literature analyzing the success of sex education programs notes the impact of network effects and social structure on sex educa-tion success [7]. We match education policy to our SI 1 | 2 model and analyze the implications.
 Policy 1: Abstinence-Only Education Abstinence-only education teaches abstinence until marriage as the only way to live a healthy life, with students often taking an absti-nence pledge. Under our model, virus 1 is believing in ab-stinence (through education or pledge) and virus 2 is sexual activity. Therefore, those who are in I 1 have taken a pledge of abstinence, those who are in I 2 are sexually active, and those people who are in S do not believe in abstinence but are not sexually active either. It is obviously impossible to both be following an abstinence pledge and to be sexually active so nobody can be in state I 1 , 2 . Equivalently in this case there is full mutual immunity or = 0.
 Model 1 Predictions and Results Based on this fit, because = 0, our model predicts  X  X inner takes all: X  the weaker virus dies out and the stronger virus survives. Soci-ology research [7], studying over 11,000 people over 7 years, notes that of the 2399 people claiming to have taken an ab-stinence pledge, 1622 (67%) over time forgot. This suggests run sexual activity will win over abstinence.
 Policy 2: Comprehensive Sex Education Comprehen-sive sex education teaches numerous methods to have a safe, healthy sex life, discussing both contraception and absti-nence. Matching this to our model, virus 1 is being ed-ucated in safe-sex practices and valuing their importance and virus 2 is sexual activity. Therefore, those who are in I have been educated about safe-sex practices and believe they are important but are not sexually active, those in I are sexually active but do not practice safe sex, those in I practice safe-sex, and those in S are neither educated on safe-sex practices nor sexually active. Here we expect little to no competition between the two viruses and thus have an value close to, if not equal to, 1.
 Model 2 Predictions and Results Because is close to 1, we expect that &gt; critical . As a result, it is possible for there to be coexistence of the two viruses, such that there can be a steady-state in which people are sexually active and practice safe-sex. This appears to match sociology literature claiming that those who initially use condoms will keep using condoms [7].
 In summary, our model qualitatively agrees with sociology research and offers a plausible explanation for the results of the study. Additionally, these two cases demonstrate the value of a phase transition. In the first case, the model sug-gests winner takes all and the ineffectiveness of abstinence-only education. On the contrary, for policy 2, the model predicts coexistence, which agrees with the findings, and is better for society.
There are several subtle points, that we deferred until now, for clarity of exposition. Specifically, here we discuss the following issues:
As before, the virus 2 transmission rate for a virus infected with virus 1 becomes  X  2 and the virus 1 transmission rate for a virus infected with virus 2 becomes  X  1 . However, because &gt; 1 the transmission rate for each virus increases for neighbors that are already infected. We consider this to be a form of cooperation between the viruses (products, ideas, etc.).

This pattern of cooperation between products is common in product ecosystems. An example of this is that people who have an iPod are more likely to buy music and videos through Apple X  X  iTunes. Making use of such cooperation can be seen in  X  X reebie marketing X  or the  X  X azor and blades busi-ness model, X  in which the company producing razor blades sells the razors at an artificially low price creating a market for the blades. This method of tightly integrating products is common in a variety of industries.
Because  X  1  X   X  2 there are two cases we can analyze. The first is when  X  1  X  1 &gt;  X  2 , in which the second virus is too weak to survive on its own. We will refer to this as the  X  X iggyback setting, X  because virus 2 can only survive with the help of the first. The second condition is when 1 &gt;  X  1  X   X  2 , where both viruses are independently too weak to survive. We will refer to this as the  X  X eamwork setting, X  because only through cooperation can both viruses survive. of N = 1000 with theoretical values overlayed, and 1 &gt;  X  . The first column, (a) and (c), is the  X  X iggyback X  footprint developing over time.
 In each of these cases, Theorem 1 still holds -plugging in  X  and  X  2 we find an critical for which a fixed point in which  X  , X  2 &gt; 0 exists. This suggests that even if both viruses are independently too weak to survive on their own, with enough cooperation they can.

To test our theorem, we ran similar simulations where either one or both viruses were too weak to independently survive. In Figure 5(a) we show the steady-state plot for the piggyback case of  X  1 &gt; 1 &gt;  X  2 . As expected, for = 1 when the viruses are independent, virus 1 survives but virus 2 is not strong enough and dies out. For a sufficient amount of cooperation, &gt; critical , we find that virus 2 can survive as well. We see in Figure 5(c), the corresponding time-plot where = 3 . 5 &gt; critical , that once virus 1 grows, virus 2 is able to survive as well.

We also simulated the teamwork case, where neither virus is independently strong enough to survive, 1 &gt;  X  In Figure 5(b) we show the steady-state plot for this case. Again, the theoretical result and predicted phase-transition match the simulation results. For = 1, the two viruses are independent and, since they cannot survive on their own, die out. In this case, the phase transition is based on the second part of Theorem 1 where  X  1 +  X  2 &lt; 2, and as such the bound is a result on the restriction of  X  2 being real. As such, at critical both  X  1 , X  2 &gt; 0 rather than equal to 0. We see here at the threshold a large amount of uncertainty in the simula-tion but as we move away from the threshold the simulation follows this new fixed point. Interestingly, we must initially infect a large portion of the graph for the system to go to this fixed point, and not die out. For = 7 . 75 &gt; critical 5(d) shows the time-plot, demonstrating that both viruses quickly reach steady-state with a high amount of overlap.
We defined and studied the problem of partial competi-tion, where two viruses/products provide partial immunity against each other.
