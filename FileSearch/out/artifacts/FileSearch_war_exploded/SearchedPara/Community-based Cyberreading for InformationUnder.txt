 Although the content in scientific publications is increasingly chal-lenging, it is necessary to investigate another important problem, that of scientific information understanding. For this proposed prob-lem, we investigate novel methods to assist scholars (readers) to better understand scientific publications by enabling physical and virtual collaboration. For physical collaboration, an algorithm will group readers together based on their profiles and reading behav-ior, and will enable the cyberreading collaboration within a online reading group. For virtual collaboration, instead of pushing read-ers to communicate with others, we cluster readers based on their estimated information needs. For each cluster, a learning to rank model will be generated to recommend readers X  communitized re-sources (i.e., videos, slides, and wikis) to help them understand the target publication.
 Information Understanding, Cyberreading, Education, User Study
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) publications, for various reasons, generally do not place a premium on writing for readability, and young scholars struggle to under-stand the scholarly literature available to them. Unfortunately, few efforts have been made to help graduate students and other junior scholars understand and consume the essence of those scientific readings. In other words, while scholarly search and recommenda-tion algorithms are well-documented, few studies address a crit-ical problem  X  scientific information understanding. Compared to search and recommendation, information understanding can be more challenging. It can be more difficult to characterize user (im-plicit and explicit) information needs when a user is reading a pa-per, and it can be even more challenging to address the personal-ization problem. For example, one can assume that when a user is  X  Xiaozhong Liu and Liangcai Gao are the corresponding authors c  X  reading a paper, he/she may require different kinds of assistance to understand the specific sentences/paragraphs/sections/formulas in the paper. Meanwhile, given the same piece of text/formula in a paper, other users may need different types of help, such as person-alized information understanding.

In this study, we propose two different kinds of information un-derstanding scenarios: information understanding via reader-reader collaboration and information understanding via Open Education Resources (OER) recommendation . The former sce-nario is based on prior studies in collaborative scaffolding (a.k.a. peer support) studies in education domain [9, 10]. Despite some criticism, evidence shows that the benefits of this type of peer sup-port exceed its limitations, and that readers can learn from each other for information understanding (physical collaboration). The latter type is based on the pilot-evidence that accessing multi-modal OER about a scholarly publication, including presentation videos, slides, source code or Wikipedia pages, in a collaborative frame-work will enhance a student X  X  ability to understand the paper it-self [6]. However, different kinds of readers, given the same pub-lication content, may prefer different kinds of OERs for informa-tion understanding. A reader community (sharing the similar infor-mation needs) may prefer similar OERs, and when we don X  X  have reader statistics, (virtual)  X  X ommunity X  can be a latent variable.
In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative cyberreading en-vironment, OER-based Collaborative PDF Reader (OCPR), which enables reader collaboration and community-based OER recom-mendation for information understanding.

The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we propose a novel method to group readers into a number of physical commu-nities, and readers from the same groups are more likely to collabo-rate while reading. Second, when readers don X  X  want to collaborate, we propose the new algorithm to group similar users into virtual communities for information need estimation and OER recommen-dation. Last but not least, an experiment (with 60 participants) is employed to validate the usefulness of the proposed methods. Ex-periment results show our methods can significantly improve OER recommendation performance for information understanding.
From an educational viewpoint, scaffolding has been widely used in educational research [10]. In particular, a collaborative scaffold-ing study [3] finds that students achieved better reading compre-hension and metacognitive skills when reading within the context of small team collaboration, e.g., comment on part of a document, share ideas, and provide feedback among a group of users [11].
However, prior studies also found collaborative scaffolding ap-proaches can be quite limited [9], and readers may not have enough incentives to collaborate while reading. Not until recently did re-searchers begin to focus on the usefulness of OER. For instance, Dennis, et al. [1] found that video presentations had significantly positive impacts on students X  learning based on quiz scores. More recently, Liu [4, 5] found OERs, such as YouTube video, technol-ogy slides, and Wikipedia pages, can help students better under-stand scientific readings. Meanwhile, information retrieval and text mining methods, i.e., language model and BM25, had been proven to be useful for building OER index for a large number of publica-tions automatically [4]. However, this approach cannot accurately address students X  emerging information need while reading a pa-per, especially for personalized or communitized reader informa-tion need estimation.
To generate physical and virtual communities and assist read-ers in understanding publications, we need to generate a number of features for reader clustering. There are two kinds of features: reader profile features (RPF) and reading behavior features (RBF). Note that RPF can be important but can be missing in some cases (e.g., online journal or proceeding paper readers). Compared to RPF, RBF can be more reliable.

To capture RBF and implement information understanding, we designed OCPR, which is depicted in Figure 1. OCPR enables two types of scaffoldings:
Collaborative Scaffolding : enabling readers to asynchronously annotate PDF publications or provide feedback and comments to existing information needs from other readers. By using the OCPR, any reader can view other readers X  information needs, such as high-lighted (quoted) parts of PDFs or specific questions/comments (as shown in Figure 1, the question or exclamation marks on the side of PDF). These readers also can provide their own replies and feed-backs to the existing or proposed information needs (reader collab-oration).

OER-based Scaffolding : capturing evidence of students X  emerg-ing implicit or explicit information needs when reading a scientific paper and recommending high quality OERs to address their infor-mation needs. As Figure 1 shows, by using OCPR, readers can ask a specific question given a piece of text which serves as evidence of an explicit information need or highlight (quote) part of a text in the paper as evidence of an implicit information need. In either case, the OCPR is able to recommend OERs given the textual content and the target paper, i.e., P ( OER | text, paper ) .

The detailed RPF and RBF features are listed in Table 1.
For any publication, a large number of readers could potentially access and read it. For this approach, the proposed task is to predict reader physical collaboration. In other words, by using the features presented in Table 1 (except for  X  X eader-reader collaboration X ), we will cluster users together, and inner cluster users are more likely to collaborate with each other. This information can be important for online cyberreading environment, e.g., OCPR. For instance, when a large number of readers are reading a paper, user x  X  X  question(s) will be broadcast to the target reader group ( user x belongs to) for potential collaboration. Compared to most existing clustering prob-lems, reader cluster copes with a smaller number of instances, so we chose the K-medoids clustering algorithm [2]. Compared to K-means and EM clustering, K-medoids is more efficient with small dataset. For evaluation, we use  X  X eader-reader collaboration X  data extracted by OCPR system.
 However, incentive can be a challenge for physical collaboration. Prior studies in scaffolding show that even though reader collabo-ration may be potentially useful, not all the readers would like to participate the online reading collaboration (e.g., reply to commu-nicate with other readers).
To address the limitations of the physical collaboration, we pro-pose a two-step method for OER-based scaffolding. First, by using the features in Table 1, we group the readers based on RPF and/or RBF. The readers from the same group are more likely to share the similar information needs. Second, for each group, we train an OER-recommendation (ranking) model, and the communitized rec-ommendation model can recommend the optimized OERs, which could highly likely help readers (from the same group) to under-stand the target publication. Note that by using this method, read-ers from the same group don X  X  necessarily know each other or need to physically collaborate with others. Instead, the group informa-tion can be used to train the OER-recommendation models. For instance, given the same piece of text in a paper, some CS students may prefer to access the source code for information understand-ing, while another group (e.g., information science students) may like to watch a video or presentation slides.
 As mentioned earlier, RPF quality can be higher than RBF (as RBF can be noisy), but RPF is not always available. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new method to optimize the clus-tering performance: (1) select the readers whose RPF are available; (2) cluster this part of readers using K-medoids algorithm based on RPF; (3) use the clustering result for a reader as his/her community label and train a Maximum Entropy classifier [8] based on read-ers X  RBF; (4) use trained classifier to predict the community of the reader who only has RBF. Unlike clustering, the proposed method can enhance the informative RBF while punishing noisy RBF.
The Maximum Entropy classifier is a discriminative classifier commonly used in NLP and IR problems. Unlike the other sim-ilar probabilistic classifiers, the Max Entropy does not assume that the features are conditionally independent of each other. This is particularly true in this study where our features are usually not in-dependent (i.e., readers with same background tend to have similar reading behavior).

In this study, by using the meta-search algorithm presented in [4], we indexed four kinds of OERs for information understanding, such as Wikipedia pages, presentation slides, presentation videos, and source code, from various sites (e.g., Videolecture, and GitHub).
As shown in Figure 1, readers can get OER recommendation from the system when they are reading a scientific paper and high-lighting a piece of text in the paper. Readers can also provide judg-ments for the recommended OERs, e.g., rated as  X  X ood, X   X  X K, X  and  X  X ad. X  We then accumulate all the OER judgments from the same reader group to train a learning to rank model for OER recommen-dation. For learning to rank model generation, we employed 56 text-and graph-based ranking features 1 . For text ranking method, we recommend OER based on the language model between the query text (in the paper) and OER content. For graph-based fea-tures, we created a heterogeneous graph, and the OER recommen-dation is conceptualized as a random walk problem on a hetero-geneous graph. Three kinds of vertices  X  paper, topic and OER  X  are interconnected by using different kinds of edges. We created different kinds of meta-paths to address different ranking hypothe-ses, and each meta-path carries one or more types of ranking in-formation [12]. For instance, K  X  s  X  R r  X  R ? video is a meta-path function, and it means the candidate OER should relate to the im-portant topic X  X  related OER and candidate OER X  X  type is video. We use the random walk probability from starting (query) vertices to the target OER vertices following a meta-path: r ( v (1) i P lowing the meta-path, and RW ( t ) is the simulated random walk probability of the tour t .

As this study is not focusing on learning to rank, we used a rela-tive simple algorithm (Coordinate Ascent [7], which iteratively op-timizes a multivariate objective ranking function) for OER ranking feature integration and algorithm evaluation.
We tested our collaboration algorithms in a real learning envi-ronment. A graduate-level information retrieval course at Indiana University is used for this experiment. Sixty students (masters and PhDs) voluntarily participated in this experiment, and they were re-quired to use the OCPR system for a semester 2 . They could use OCPR functions to read scientific readings, ask questions, write comments and receive access to the system-recommended OERs. Meanwhile, we asked each participant to provide OER relevance judgments for the top five system-recommended OERs. There are a total of 39 valid users (who launched requests in more than six different readings and has made more than eight OER ratings) for this experiment. Meanwhile, there are total 626 OER recommen-dation requests with 3,551 valid OER usefulness judgments. For reader collaboration, there are total 568 messages sent among 39 users.

In this experiment, we collect two kinds of RPF: 1. students X  course taking history ( X  X PF-C X  boolean features), e.g., if student has taken  X  X achine learning X  and  X  X tatistics X  courses. 2. students X  technical background survey ( X  X PF-TB X  ordinal features from 1 to 4), e.g., if they have expertise in  X  X  X  and  X  X oSQL X  .
 At the backend of OCPR, we created text and graph indexes for OER recommendation. For paper, we used 41,370 publications from 1,553 venues (mainly from the ACM digital library). The paper vertices are connected to 9,263 keyword labeled topics. By using meta-search, we collected a total of 1,112,718 OERs.
As Table 3 shows, we use different kinds of feature sets to clus-ter the students, and the evaluation metrics are precision, recall, and F1. In the experiment, we set the cluster number as 3 (for total 39 participants). The ground truth is student-student commu-nication data via OCPR. For instance, if student 1 and student communicate via OCPR, they should belong to the same cluster. Otherwise, they should belong to different clusters. Evaluation re-sults shows that RPF-all achieves the best recall, while RPF-TB optimizes the precision. When RPF features are not available, RBF features achieve 0.3862 F1, which is lower than RPF.

For OER recommendation task, participants rated 19.8% of the recommended OERs as  X  X ood X  , 23.9% as  X  X K X  , 49.3% as  X  X ad X  , and 6.9% as  X  X ot Sure X  . For this experiment, we use the globe learning-to-rank as baseline [6] (without student clusters). From an nDCG viewpoint, we score Good = 2 , OK = 1 , and Bad = 0 . The OER recommendation performance can be found in Table 2. We use nDCG@3 as the indicator to train the learning to rank mod-els. For evaluation, 10-fold cross-validation was utilized.
In experiment, all valid readers have RPF, we use 4-fold Cross-validation to simulate the reality situation(randomly choose 25% students, assume they have no RPF, use the other 75% readers to train a Max entropy classifier to predict this 25% readers X  commu-nities).

As Table 2 shows, the recommendation based on RPF ( p&lt;0.001 ) and RBF with Max Entropy training ( p&lt;0.05 ) outperforms globe learning-to-rank (baseline) OER-recommendation method for all the metrics. The recommendation based on RPF achieved the best MAP@3 and nDCG@3, while RBF with Max Entropy training achieved MAP@5, MAP@all, nDCG@5, nDCG@all and MRR (mean reciprocal rank).
In this study, we propose a novel task to assist readers to better understand scientific publications by enabling their physical or vir-tual collaboration. For reader community detection, we employed two kinds of features, RPF and RBF. The former one X  X  quality is high, but not always available. The latter one can be noisy. Experiment results show that: first, for physical collaboration, RPF-based clusters are more useful to predict the user physical col-laboration. When RPF is not available, we can use RBF, but the per-formance will be compromised. Second, for virtual collaboration, the proposed two-step method can significantly improve the OER-scaffolding performance, i.e., recommend communitized OERs to help the readers from each community to better understand the sci-entific publications given their information needs. When RPF are partially missing, Max Entropy algorithm can be used to infer the community labels by combining partial RPF plus RBF. One lim-itation of this study is the lack of collaboration between different clusters. We will address this problem in the future work by explor-ing a soft or overlapping clustering algorithm.
