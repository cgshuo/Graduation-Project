When publishing a graph, the link information as well as the sensitive attributes should be protected [2,6]. around Ben, such as Fig. 2 (a) or (b) to attack the published graph. re-identification .

For any two integer numbers M and x with 1  X  x  X  M k , M x 1  X  x  X  M provide link protection. The Safety Clustering Condition requests:  X  For any super node C , the number of edges d C between nodes within C must satisfy d  X 
For two super nodes C x and C y , the number of edges d C clustered graphs. Suppose that G  X  is a sampled graph from the published graph. If an edge appears both in G graph G, we call this edge as a true edge. We use the ratio of true edges in G correctly represented by G  X  . The ratio of true edges TR is defined as: TR  X  represents G . We use expTR to represent the expected ratio of true edges in any sampled graph. provided .

For a clustered graph, when link protection must be guaranteed, according to the Safety Clustering Condition: 7. Discussion like to use them to demonstrate the completeness and extensibility of our model. state-of-the-art protection model fails in this case. Suppose an attacker has the knowledge that two is based on each Semi-Edge. Given a Semi-Edge ( u , C ), if the probability between u and v like to discuss how our model can be extended to handle these more complex cases. on the graph: K 1 sim Q u  X  X  ; Q  X  X   X  t  X  Su  X  X  X  s ; K 2 sim G 0 u  X  X  ; G k  X  t  X  Su  X  X  X  s ; K 3 sim Q u  X  X  ; Qv  X  X   X  X   X  t  X  eu ; v  X  X  ;
