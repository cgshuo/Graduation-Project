 Retrieval (CLIR) system has been an effective method where the language X  X  pair has research, we translated Indonesian query into Japanese keyword list through English as the pivot language. Because Indonesian has limited data resources, we used a bilingual dictionary in the transitive translation. 
A transitive translation based on a bilingual dictionary usually produces many frequencies are analyzed to disambiguate phrase translations. The co-occurrences taken as the appropriate translation. The selection is to select best English translation English sentence by the coherence score. They used EMMI weighting measure [17] by taken into account the distance between words to calculate the coherence score. In English corpus. The coherence score calculation was based on 1) web page count; 2) information score taken from monolingual corpus and TF X IDF score to select the best translation. The transitive translation results are compared to the direct translation result using Indonesian-Japanese dictionary and also compared to a transitive translation based on experiment result, and conclusion. There are two sub systems in the Indonesian-Japanese query translation: (1) Keyword system includes word matching and stop word elimination process. 
Indonesian queries usually consist of native (Indonesian) words and borrowed words. For example, Indonesian query  X  X aya ingin mengetahui siapa yang telah menjadi peraih Academy Awards beberapa generasi secara berturut-turut X  which Academy Awards X  includes a borrowed word  X  X cademy Awards X . The word  X  X cademy Awards X  is borrowed from English in its original spelling. Using only Indonesian-English and English-Japanese dictionaries will not be able to translate the translate the borrowed words, we used English-Japanese dictionary. English-Japanese dictionary is used to translate borrowed words because most of borrowed words in our query translation system are come from English. The keyword translation system resulted in many irrelevant translation candidates. candidates. This keyword selection system is described in the next section. the highest mutual information score among all sequences, we combined both scores by selecting the highest TF X IDF score among 5 top mutual information scores which are calculated iteratively. To avoid the calculation of all sequences, we calculated the mutual information score per word pair. First, we selected the 50 (or less) best mutual These 50 best sequences joined with the 3 rd translation set are recalculated to get the translation sets. This step is repeated until all translation sets are covered. For a word sequence, the mutual information score is: word, it will have no impact on the mutual information score of a word sequence. 
The next step is re-rank the sequence of the 5 best mutual information score based on the TF X IDF score. The TF X IDF score used here is the relevance score (Equation selected 1 query among the 5 best mutual information scores with the highest TF X IDF score. number of documents containing term t . N denotes the total number of documents in contained in i ), and avglen denotes the average length of documents in the collection. 4.1 Experimental Data Our CLIR experiments are done on NTCIR-3 Web Retrieval Task data (100 Gb Japanese documents). In the NTCIR-3 data, the Japanese queries and English queries were prepared. The Indonesian queries (47 queries) are manually translated from University). The query translation system used resources below:  X

Indonesian-Japanese dictionary (online dictionary [12], 14,823 Indonesian words) 4.2 Experimental Result In the experiment, we compared our proposed method with 2 other translation bilingual dictionary without any keyword selection. shown are in Mean Average Precision (MAP) scores. There are 4 MAP scores: RL (highly with hyperlink information used), PC (partially relevant document as correct answer). 
Fig. 1 shows that using keyword selection in the query translation enhanced the IR score achieved by the baseline method (iej). Using 3 highest mutual information score sequences (iej-I-3) achieved higher IR score compared to the 5 or 10 highest mutual information score. Using only 1 sequence (iej-I1) achieved better IR score than using using the mutual information score only. By using the combination of mutual information and TF X IDF score in keyword selection, it enhanced the baseline method (iej) by 114%. 
Compared to the direct translation with a middle sized Indonesian-Japanese only used Indonesian-Japanese dictionary got lower IR score than the iej-IR for about English-Japanese dictionary (ij-e), the IR score is almost the same as iej-IR. Compared to the machine translation result, iej-IR achieved higher IR score. Compared to the Kataku and Babelfish machine translation result, iej-IR gained higher IR score about 39%. And compared to the Kataku and Excite machine translation result, iej-IR also achieved almost the same IR score. dictionary. The important words in queries for an IR system are proper nouns. about 12 queries with proper nouns or OOV such as  X  X orse X ,  X  X ggdrasil X ,  X  X iyabe X ,  X  X iyuki X ,  X  X anguozhi X ,  X  X yoto X ,  X  X zoni X ,  X  X hiba inu X ,  X  X ara X ,  X  X eian X , etc. information and TF X IDF score can improve IR score significantly in comparison with the baseline method. It is even get higher IR score than other translation systems such Babelfish (English-Japanese) machine translation. The keyword selection is quite candidates. This method is also applicable for language with limited data resources or surprised language such as Indonesian language. system. These proper nouns usually hold as important keywords. Using only bilingual work, we will address the proper noun problems in our query translation system. The 21 st Century COE Program  X  X ntelligent Human Sensing X .
