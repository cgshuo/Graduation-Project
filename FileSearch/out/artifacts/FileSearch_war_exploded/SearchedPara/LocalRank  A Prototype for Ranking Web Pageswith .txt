 For a specific geographical area, there are usually many web resources corresponding to entities existing in the real world (e.g., web pages of a certain organization in this area). They may have been known by a user or can be acquired easily from some web directories or by following the links of a portal web site about this area. For example, consider a user is interested in information about restaurants in Tsukuba city, Japan and he or she has a table shown in Fig. 1. Effective use of this known information to rank web pages is the main concern of this paper.

Recently some researches [1] proposed to consider relationships between database entries as a kind of  X  X inks X  and apply a link analysis to a database. We extend this idea to integrate the web and a user database a nd perform a link analysis to rank related web pages. In our method, we first construct a linked graph structure for the specific geographical area using entries contained in the database. Then a link analysis is per-formed based on this graph. This graph represents the information of the user provided database, its related web pages, and their rela tionships. Therefore, the results of the link analysis, called LocalRank , not only reflect web pages X  popularity on the locally con-structed web space (as opposed to the global web), but also take their relevance degrees to the user database into consideration. Hence, our method can be thought of as a rank-ing approach based on user X  X  interest. We also consider geographical locality of web pages by generating geographical links between database entries and web pages. In this section, we first show a model for integrating the web and a database. Then we introduce how a graph structure is constructed and how LocalRank is calculated. The details of the method are shown in [2]. 2.1 Authority Transfer Schema Graph For a database of Fig. 1, we first describe an authority transfer schema graph (Fig. 2). The left restaurant denotes the user database and the right page stands for the set of web pages. This graph reflects some relationships between database entries and web pages.

We call the solid lines and dotted lines in this graph links , since we extend the con-cept of hyperlinks between web pages to the integrated space of the web and a database. We also call the values between 0 and 1 assigned to the links their weights .Howto assign proper weights to links may be a trial process performed until the quality of re-sults becomes satisfactory. The solid lines correspond to  X  X eal X  links. The refers link means a reference from a web page to anot her page and the weight  X 0.7 X  means that a page X  X  score is multiplied by 0.7 and then transferred to its linked page. A kind of links, whose weights in both directions are equal, is represented by  X  X  X  . For example, we use the has-HP link to represent a correspondence relationship between a database entry and its homepage, and assume the weights from any side to another side are equal (i.e., they influence each other e qually). In this case we use  X  X  X  for has-HP .

The dotted lines are  X  X irtual X  links which show semantic relationships. The is-close link is generated to connect a databas e entry and a web page if their loca-tions are close. matches links are generated as follows. We retrieve a search engine using  X  X ame X  and  X  X hone X  attributes of database entries as query keywords and create matches links between the returned pages and their corresponding database entries. 2.2 Authority Transfer Data Graph Then we embody the authority transfer schema graph (Fig. 2) by an authority transfer data graph (Fig. 3).
 First we describe how to generate the nodes of the authority transfer data graph. 1. For each entry of the restaurant ta ble, generate a corresponding node. 2. Download the homepage of each restaura nt using the  X  X RL X  attribute of the table 3. Get the web pages that are reachable fro m the homepages in the same web site and 4. For each homepage, retrie ve its backlink pages using a search engine. These web 5. Perform keyword searches using the  X  X ame X  and  X  X hone X  attributes of each row 6. For all the web pages in S 1 , S 2 , S 3 and S 4 acquired in Step 2, 3, 4 and 5, generate 7. Extract URLs from the web pages in S 1 , S 2 , S 3 and S 4 and generate nodes for
As shown above, the nodes of the authority transfer data graph consist of the en-tries of the restaurant table and their related web pages including the downloaded and undownloaded ones.

Next the links between these nodes are generated as follows. 1. For the web pages in S 1 , connect them to the corresponding restaurant entries with 2. Based on the results of the URL extraction in Step 7 of the node generation, create 3. For the web pages in S 4 (obtained from a search engine using the  X  X ame X  and 4. Generate bidirectional is-close links between the web pages in S 1  X  S 2  X  S 3  X  S 4
We assign some weights to the links based on the settings of the authority transfer schema graph. Notice that when two or more edges belonging to a same kind of links go out from a same node, the weight is divided by the number of outgoing edges. For example, if there are two refers links going out from a web page, the weight  X 0.7 X  of the refers link in the authority transfer schema graph (Fig. 2) is divided by two and the weights of both outgoing edges become  X 0.35 X .

As mentioned above, a graph structure called an authority transfer data graph (Fig. 3) is constructed. In Fig. 3, the left oval nodes represent the entries of the restaurant table, while the middle square nodes and right circle nodes denote the downloaded web pages and the undownloaded URLs, respectively. 2.3 LocalRank Calculation We calculate next the score called LocalRank for each node in the authority transfer data graph by the following equation. where n is the number of the nodes in the authority transfer data graph, d is a damping factor given by a user, A denotes an n  X  n matrix, the value of whose element ( i, j ) sums the weights of all edges from i to j , A is the transposed matrix of A , r denotes a column vector with n dimensions, whose element is the LocalRank value of each node, and e denotes an n -dimension column vector with all elements set to 1. All elements of r are initialized to 1 and the calculation terminates when r converges.
 Although the calculation equation is similar to PageRank [3], the sense of our Local-Rank is different from PageRank. Since we calculate the scores based on the authority transfer data graph which in tegrates the web and a user database, instead of the con-ventional web space, our LocalRank reflects h ow a web page is related to the database entries which the user provides, in add ition to its popularity on the web space. Hence, our method ranks web pages considering their relevance degree to user X  X  interest. More-over, let us remind that we have used the geographical is-close links to connect the web and the database and applied them to the link analysis. Therefore, geographical locality is also infused into the rankings of web pages. In our demo, two ranking lists will be exhibited, respectively for the downloaded pages and undownloaded URLs extracted from them. The attendees can browse the con-tents of the corresponding page by clicking one item. For one page, the categories and weights of the real and virtual links to it, and its parent pages and parent database entries can also be shown. Moreover we will give the result comparison between PageRank and our LocalRank.
