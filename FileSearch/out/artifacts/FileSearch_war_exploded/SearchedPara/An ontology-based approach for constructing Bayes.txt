According to Neapolitan [24] , Bayesian networks are ships among a large number of variables and doing probabilistic inference with those variables lowing challenges arise at the construction of Bayesian networks:  X  identification of variables that are relevant to the considered domain (nodes),  X  identification of relationships between the identified variables (links), and  X  creation of the conditional probability table for each variable.

The proposed ontology-based approach for constructing Bayesian networks consists of four main phases: 1. Selection of relevant classes, individuals, and properties 2. Creation of the Bayesian network structure 3. Construction of the CPTs 4. Incorporation of existing knowledge facts the output of phase 1. Each phase is described in detail in the following subsections. 4.1. Selection of relevant classes, individuals, and properties
