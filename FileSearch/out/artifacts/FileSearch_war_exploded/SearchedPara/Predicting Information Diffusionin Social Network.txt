 There are a lot of studies on information diffusion in the Online Social Net-work (OSN), and many of them focus on retweeting, which is a main form of information diffusion. Suh et al. examine a number of features that might affect retweetability of tweets based on a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) [ 10 ]. Zhang et al. consider a diversity of personal attributes for retweeting behavior predic-status [ 14 ].
 observation from the group level. During the process of information diffusion, users X  social roles play an important part. Usually opinion leaders [ 8 ] will dom-inate the retweeting within a group. When information needs to spread across the groups, the users who span the structural holes [ 3 ] are more critical. Besides the social roles, users X  topic interests are another important part. Users have significant interest differences in distinct topics, which indirectly affect whom they follow and whether they will retweet the tweet, thus affecting the whole information diffusion process. Therefore, based on users X  social roles and topic interests, we propose a simple prediction approach for information diffusion. Social Role Analysis. For the opinion leaders extracting, there are some algo-rithms based on the original PageRank [ 2 ] algorithm. For instance, Haveliwala proposes the Topic-Sensitive PageRank [ 6 ], and Weng et al. propose the Twit-terrank [ 11 ]. For structural hole spanners X  finding, Granovetter proposes that nodes will benefit from linking different parts of the network together [ 5 ]. Based on this, Burt puts forward the conception of structural hole [ 3 ].LouanTang propose an algorithm called HIS to identify structural hole spanners [ 7 ]. Topic Interest Analysis. Most previous studies attempt to mine the users X  topic interests through their original tweets or the tweets retweeted from others, and mainly use the model like LDA. For instance, tag-LDA proposed by Si and Sun [ 9 ] and Twitter-LDA put forward by Zhao and Jiang [ 15 ]. In our work, we analyze the users X  topic interests not only with the tweets, but the users X  following relationship as well.
 Information Diffusion Prediction. Zaman et al. train a probabilistic collab-orative filter model to predict future retweets [ 13 ]. Yang et al. study the infor-mation diffusion via the retweeting behavior, and also propose a semisupervised framework to predict the retweeting [ 12 ]. Let G =( V, E ) denotes a social network, where V is a set of users, and E is a set of links between users, in which e vu  X  E denotes the directed link from user v to user u ( v, u  X  V ). 3.1 Opinion Leader Finding We use the PageRank algorithm [ 2 ] to calculate the users X  influence. Definition 1. Let i be a user(node) of the social network, i set of user i  X  X  followers, and R ( i )isthesetofusersthat i follows. N ( i )= is the number of user i  X  X  followees.
 Let PR ( i ) donates the influence value of user i , then the equation for calcu-lating the influence value of each user is PR ( i )= d the damping coefficient, and n is the number of users in the social network. However, a user with a high PR value may not be the authority figure for a specific topic. Considering this, we introduce the topic authoritativeness to evaluate the user X  X  influence on specific topics. We use the 16 top-level categories from Open Directory Project 1 to classify the topics of the social network. For each topic, we give each opinion leader i a value a i,t  X  authoritativeness on topic t , then we can get a new PR value for each opinion leader which we denote as AP R ( i )= a i,t PR ( i ). 3.2 Structural Hole Spanner Finding We use the HIS algorithm [ 7 ] for the structural hole spanner mining over disjoint groups.
 Definition 2. Giving a network G =( V, E ), denote that G is grouped into m groups G = { G 1 ,G 2 ,...,G m } , with V = G 1  X  ...  X  G j  X  m ); let I ( v, C i )  X  [0 , 1] denotes the importance score of user v in community i ; for each subset of communities S ( S  X  Cand | S | X  2), let SH ( v, S ) denotes the structural hole spanner score of user v in S .
 algorithm [ 1 ]. Then the two scores I ( v, C i )and SH ( v, S ) can be defined in terms of each other in a mutual recursion: where  X  i and  X  S are two tunable parameters. For initialization, we use the PageRank algorithm to initialize the importance score I ( v, C 3.3 Topic Interest Analysis We classify the users into two types, the famous users and the normal users We first collect all the original tweets from the famous users, then we filter the original tweets of each user v , if he/she has sent the tweets relevant to the topic t , we can say the user v has interests in topic t . Then we get the normal users X  topic interests from whom they follow. We collect all the famous users that a normal user u follows, then count the famous users who have interests on topic t that user u follows, and get the number of famous users related as c . In our work, we extend the Independent Cascade (IC) model [ 4 ] with users X  social roles and topic interests, and propose an approach called Role and Topic aware Independent Cascade (RTIC).
 problem: given a tweet m , a topic t ,auser v and its inactive followers set U = { u 1 ,u 2 ,...,u n } , where n is the number of v  X  X  inactive followers, and a timestamp t , the goal is to categorize user u  X  X ( u  X  U ) status at time t +1. We denote the classification outcome as y t v,u .Ifuser u retweet the tweet m at time t from user v , then y t v,u = 1; otherwise y t v,u = 0. We consider three factors: x x and x 3 . x 1 is the AP R value of user v , x 2 is the SH score of user v , while x indicates the number c of famous users who have interests on topic t that u follows. In this paper, we use the logistic regression model to predict the value of is as follows: where  X  0 is a bias, and  X  1 ,  X  2 ,  X  3 are weights of the features. We define a threshold  X  [0 , 1], if P  X  , then the user u will retweet the tweet from the user v , otherwise not. Let tw u denote the number of tweets of user u ,and tw avg denotes the average number of tweets of all users, then we define the value as = 1 5.1 Experimental Setup Dataset. We evaluate our approach on three different real Weibo datasets from [ 14 ]. Three big events are extracted from the original datasets for further analy-sis, which are  X  X o Yan won the Nobel Prize in Literature X ,  X  X iu Xiang quit the 110-metre hurdle in the 2012 Olympic Games X  and  X  X ang Zhouzi criticizes Han Han X  X  articles are ghostwritten X  3 . The statistics are shown in Table 1 . Baseline. We consider the following comparison methods in our experiments: LRC-B. Proposed in [ 14 ], it uses the logistic regression model and uses a variety of features to train the logistic regression classifier.
 No-Roles. This is a variant of the RTIC approach, which only considers the users X  topic interests, and ignores the users X  social roles. No-Interests. This is also a variant of the RTIC approach which only considers the users X  social roles as opinion leaders or structural hole spanners. Hyperparameter. Through extensive empirical studies, we set d as 0.85,  X  performance variation of information diffusion prediction, and finally we set the top 0.01 % users as opinion leaders. Same thing for structural hole spanners. 5.2 Performance Analysis Social Role Analysis. We calculate the influence coverage of each dataset, which means the percentage of the opinion leaders X  followers in the all users of the data set. The results are 75.6 %, 68.6 %, 63.1 % respectively, which are quite strong. For the structural hole spanners mining, we count the number of groups that a structural hole spanner X  X  followers can cover, and the results show that most structural hole spanners X  followers can cover above 50 % of the whole groups, and some even can cover 100 % of the groups, which means that as long as a structural hole spanner retweet a tweet, the information can propagate to a large amount of users from the unrelated groups.
 Information Diffusion Prediction. We use the Mo Yan dataset as the train-ing set, and the Han Han dataset as the testing set. Table 2 shows the perfor-mance of the proposed approach RTIC and baselines of information diffusion prediction task.
 in terms of F 1 Measure. We may conclude that the features considered in LRC-B are basically about the users X  own profiles, but ignore the structure of the network and the semantic information, which is quite important in the real social networks. The performance of the both variant approaches is unsatisfactorily, however, the No-Roles is better than the No-Interests method. 5.3 Parameter Analysis We use each data set as the training set to train the four parameters  X  and  X  3 . The results are shown in Table 3 . The quite similar parameters indicate that it X  X  possible to use one dataset to train the parameters. In this paper, we propose an approach called Role and Topic aware Independent Cascade (RTIC), which aims to simplify the approach by reducing the number of features considered. We evaluate our approach on real Weibo data sets, and the results show it outperforms other baseline approaches with only a limited number of features considered. As a future work, we want to study how the influential nodes work in the whole information diffusion process.
