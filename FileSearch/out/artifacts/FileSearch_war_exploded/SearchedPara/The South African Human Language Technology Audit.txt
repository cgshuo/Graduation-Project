 Abstract Human language technology (HLT) has been identified as a priority area by the South African government. However, despite efforts by government and the research and development (R&amp;D) community, South Africa has not yet been able to maximise the opportunities of HLT and create a thriving HLT industry. One of the key challenges is the fact that there is insufficient codified knowledge about the current South African HLT components, their attributes and existing relationships. Hence a technology audit was conducted for the South African HLT landscape, to create a systematic and detailed inventory of the status of the HLT components across the eleven official languages. Based on the Basic Language Resource Kit (BLaRK) framework Krauwer (ELRA Newslett 3(2), 1998 ), we used various data collection methods (such as focus groups, questionnaires and personal consultations with HLT experts) to gather detailed information. The South African HLT land-scape is analysed using a number of complementary approaches and based on the interpretations of the results, recommendations are made on how to accelerate HLT development in South Africa, as well as on how to conduct similar audits in other countries and contexts.

The National HLT Network (NHN), sponsored by DST, is an informal, online community that aims to strengthen synergies between HLT research practitioners in South Africa. It currently consists mainly of members from the major South African tertiary institutions and science councils who are actively involved in HLT R&amp;D activities. In 2009, NHN undertook a large-scale technology audit for the HLT landscape in South Africa, called the South African HLT Audit (SAHLTA).
 Despite a number of efforts by government and the R&amp;D community, South Africa has not yet been able to maximise on the opportunities of HLT, and to create a thriving HLT industry (in comparison to, for example, The Netherlands or the United States of America). One of the key challenges in addressing this problem is the perceived fragmentation of R&amp;D activities in this domain: there is insufficient codified knowledge about the currently available South African HLT resources and applications. These challenges, which motivated the SAHLTA, are very similar to those faced by other resource-scarce languages, especially in the developing world. The lack of language resources (LRs), limited availability of and access to existing LRs, quality of LRs, small-scale and uncoordinated HLT development, and the lack of infrastructure for LR management, are all common issues faced by the development of LRs in resource-scarce languages. Thus, our experiences in the SAHLTA process and representation of the results would be of value to other countries that face similar challenges in HLT development.

Thus, the objective of our study was to codify and present a profile of HLT components in the South African R&amp;D environment. This article aims to provide an overview of the SAHLTA process, as well as to present a selection of the results (cf. Sharma Grover ( 2009 ) for an extensive report). In the next section we refer to related work, before discussing in Sect. 3 an overview of the SAHLTA process and instruments we used. In Sect. 4 we present a concise overview of some of our results, in Sect. 5 the discussion and recommendations, and in Sect. 6 the conclusion and directions for future work. 2 Related work A technology audit is valuable in any technology field, since it allows stakeholders to identify and measure problems and/or performance gaps, while providing information to set the background for the definition of future action plans (Khalil 2000 ). The outcome of a technology audit is analogous to a  X  X  X alance sheet X  X : a snapshot of the organisation X  X  current technological status, as well as an indication of the future directions for maintaining and improving the organisation X  X  status (Martino 1994 ; Probert et al. 1999 ). Bross ( 1999 : 397) highlights that technology audits can also be used to identify technological strengths and weaknesses of a sector or industry. As an instrument it supports policy makers in designing appropriate strategies for shaping science and technology (S&amp;T) policies. Thus, within a national landscape, a technology audit can be conducted at a sector level (e.g. HLT, biotechnology, nanotechnology, etc.), allowing an assessment of the technological competitiveness and innovation potential of the country in that particular sector.

In the international field of HLT, a number of such technology audits have been undertaken. The earliest example is the Dutch HLT survey (Binnenpoorte et al . 2002 ), which applied Krauwer X  X  ( 1998 ) concept of the  X  X asic language resource kit X  (BLaRK) X  X  set of basic language resources available to conduct preliminary research in HLT X  X o conduct a field survey for Dutch LRs. Over the past few years, the BLaRK concept and the Dutch survey have inspired HLT surveys for a few other languages, including Arabic (carried out by NEMLAR and MEDAR; Maegaard et al. 2006 , Maegaard et al. 2009 ), Swedish (Elenius et al. 2008 ), and Bulgarian (Simov et al. 2004 ). The BLaRK concept has also been broadened to cater for not just pre-competitive research, but also for advanced HLT development. The Extended Language Resource Kit (ELARK; Mapelli et al. 2003 ) serves as a definition of HLT components for advanced research or commercial development (i.e. more sophisticated modules, tools and a larger variety of data). On the other extreme, many world languages have very little or no HLTs, and for their purposes an entry-level BLaRK, termed the BLaRKette (Krauwer 2006 ), is defined. The BLaRKette caters for very basic research, as well as training and education in academia.

Another well-known HLT survey was the EUROMAP project that benchmarked and measured European countries X  progress in the HLT field. Countries were compared on two broad measures, viz . an  X  X pportunity index X  and a  X  X LT Benchmark index X , where the former represents  X  X  X he robustness of the opportunity to exploit HLT X  X , and the latter measures the  X  X  X rospects for and success of HLT research and technology transfer X  X  (Joscelyne and Lockwood 2003 ).

Recently, initiatives like FlaReNet 3 and META-NET 4 are also concerned with aspects related to fostering the development of language resources, including auditing of available resources for various languages, setting priorities, managing a sustainable LR environment, etc. 3 SAHLTA process Based on the above, the BLaRK concept was chosen to guide the audit, since it provides a well-defined structure to capture the different HLT components. The subsequent sections describe the process we followed in conducting the South African HLT technology audit, which could serve as basis for other subsequent audits in other countries or for other languages. 3.1 Terminology, inventory criteria framework and cursory inventory We commenced by developing an HLT terminology list to establish the nomenclature, taxonomy and descriptions for the HLT components to be used in the audit, according to the following BLaRK classification:  X  Data (either speech or text; e.g. corpora, lexica, grammars, etc.);  X  Modules (software units or processes required to create HLT applications and  X  Applications (used by end-users with a dedicated user interface; e.g. proofing/ Whilst the Dutch and Arabic efforts provided a useful point of departure, some adaptation was required for the South African context. For example, we note that the environments of these languages are significantly different from that of South African languages due to various reasons:  X  South Africa has different market needs, where the target users are not only  X  Significant technological advancement has been made in the field of HLT for
Departing from these application categories, we refined them (for example, categories for audio search and reference works were added), taking into account the above-mentioned issues. (For further details on the ontology of these HLT components please refer to the supplementary online resources available on the WWW. 5 )
Our second step involved the establishment of an HLT inventory criteria framework that defined the criteria or dimensions on which the HLT components would be audited and documented. It is not sufficient to know whether a component exists or not, but rather a detailed assessment (e.g. quality, availability, adaptability, etc.) is required on the component to determine its usability.

Concurrently, we built a cursory inventory to identify existing HLT components (using the data, modules, and applications categories defined above) for each of the eleven South African official languages, across the major HLT role players in the country. This was based on research groups X  websites, published project reports, academic publications and consultations with a few local HLT experts. 3.2 Audit workshop The above-mentioned outputs (Sect. 3.1 ) served as inputs for an audit workshop with eight South African HLT experts (representing speech and text technologies). The workshop was aimed on the one hand at establishing and verifying the audit process and instruments (including terminology and inventory criteria framework), as well as identifying priorities for applications and related LRs (data and modules) for South Africa. 3.2.1 Inventory criteria framework Each audit dimension of the inventory criteria framework was described in terms of either the possible states that it could be in (e.g. maturity could be  X  X nder development X ,  X  X lpha version X ,  X  X eta version X  or  X  X eleased X ), or in terms of subjective descriptions on the details of the item (e.g. the documentation dimension would be described in terms of the availability of publications, reports, etc.). The final inventory criteria framework is summarised below (see Sharma Grover et al. ( 2010a ) for more details):  X  Technical description (e.g. description, size, stratum, programming language,  X  Availability (i.e. accessibility, maturity, distribution, licensing, and cost);  X  Documentation (e.g. details of publications, reports, websites, user manuals,  X  Quality (i.e. verification and/or proof of quality, and compatibility with  X  Reusability/adaptability (e.g. compatibility with other data formats, standard 3.2.2 Prioritisation of HLT components During the workshop, a first draft of priorities for applications and associated LRs was also developed. The most relevant factors that should be taken into consideration were identified, and include:  X  International trends: best practices and current developments in the field of HLT  X  Local market needs: factors such as socio-economic constraints, culture,  X  Feasibility: technical feasibility and practical implications such as cost and time-
A basic descending 3-point priority scale was defined for assigning priorities to the HLT components as follows:  X  1 = Requires definite attention for furthering development;  X  2 = Attention should be given based on specific needs and trends; or  X  3 = Nice-to-have for further research or enhancement. 3.3 Audit questionnaire The inventory criteria framework formed the backbone for the audit questionnaire, which was aimed at gathering data on available HLT components in South Africa. The audit questionnaire consists of four major sections: one for each HLT component category (i.e.  X  X ata X ,  X  X odule X ,  X  X pplication X ), as well as a section,  X  X ools/Platforms X , which was added to accommodate technologies that are typically language-independent and aid the development of HLTs (e.g. annotation tools, or corpus searching tools, or platforms that provide easy interfaces to other tools). Each section included the most relevant criteria for that particular category.
The audit questionnaire was sent to all major HLT role-players in South Africa. Based on their historical core HLT competence in R&amp;D, organisations were classified as primary (e.g. universities) or secondary (e.g. national lexicographic units) participants. The response rate was 80% for primary participants, and 33% for secondary participants (as expected, since these participants are in general not very active in the field of HLT in South Africa). All primary participants were paid a minimal honorarium to compensate for the considerable effort that was required from them. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 HLT priorities We present first the prioritisation of the HLT applications for South Africa, as determined during the audit workshop (Sect. 3.2.2 ). It can be observed from the priority list in Table 1 that many advanced HLT applications were given only priority 2 or 3, despite the fact that much attention is being paid to these internationally (e.g. question answering or dictation); however, local market needs and feasibility factors played a strong role in determining this priority list, as indicated in Sect. 3.2.2 above. As the HLT industry in South Africa develops further, this priority list will need to be updated.
Subsequently, the prioritisation of LRs (data and modules) was also done during the workshop, using the same priority scale as defined above (see Sharma Grover 2009 , or supplementary online resources 6 ). 4.2 HLT components In order to compare the state of HLT components for all eleven languages, we created the  X  X LT Language Index X , an impressionistic index that relatively ranks languages based on the total quantity of HLT activity within a language, together with the stage of maturity and accessibility of their LRs and applications. This index was created by summation of the  X  X aturity Index X  and the  X  X ccessibility Index X . Finally, we also did a gap analysis to determine the current status quo versus the identified priorities.
 4.2.1 Maturity index The Maturity Index provides a measure of the maturity of HLT components in a language by taking into account the maturity stage of an item against the relative importance or contribution of each maturity stage. The  X  X aturity sum X  per item grouping (e.g.  X  X ronunciation resources X ) for each language is calculated as: where UD is the number of components in the  X  X nder development X  phase, AV is the number of  X  X lpha version X  components, BV is the number of  X  X eta version X  components, and RV is the number of  X  X eleased version X  components. The weights for the different versions are relative weights, in order to give greater importance to the final, released versions of components. The weight assigned to a maturity stage is double that of the preceding maturity stage, i.e. an  X  X lpha version X  item counts twice as much as an  X  X nder development X  item, or a  X  X eta version X  item counts twice as much as an  X  X lpha version X  item, etc. (For an example of these calculations, see Sharma Grover et al . 2010b ).
Maturity sums were calculated across component groupings for all data, modules and applications per language. To obtain a comparative approximation of the maturity across the different languages, the  X  X aturity Index X  (per language) was calculated by normalising the total of all the maturity sums (i.e. all item groupings across data, modules and applications for a language) by the sum of weights for the maturity stages (1 ? 2 ? 4 ? 8 = 15), as shown below: Figure 1 illustrates this  X  X aturity Index X  that was calculated for each language; note this index is a relative index since it is based on the total number of HLT components that exist in a language, 7 and indicates how mature the language is in terms of the development stages of its HLT components. 4.2.2 Accessibility index The Accessibility Index provides a measure of the accessibility of HLT components in a language by considering the accessibility stage of an item as well as the relative importance of each accessibility stage. The  X  X ccessibility sum X  is calculated per HLT component grouping for each language as follows;
Accessibility Sum  X  X  UN 1  X  X  X  NA 2  X  X  X  RE 4  X  X  X  CO 8  X  X  X  CRE 12  X  where UN is the number of components that are classified as  X  X nspecified X  in terms of the accessibility stage, NA is the number of components that are listed as  X  X ot available (proprietary or contract R&amp;D 8 ) X , RE is the number of components  X  X vailable for research and education (R&amp;E) X , CO is the number of compo-nents  X  X vailable for commercial purposes X  and CRE is the number of components  X  X vailable for commercial purposes and R&amp;E X  in terms of accessibility. Similar to the maturity sum, relative weights were assigned to the different accessibility stages, with higher weights for stages that make a component more accessible (e.g. available for commercial). Since the  X  X vailable for commercial purposes and R&amp;E X  categories, it was assigned only 1.5 times the weight of the preceding score, i.e. 1.5 * 8 = 12).

Similar to the Maturity Index, the Accessibility Index was determined by calculating accessibility sums across component groupings for all data, modules and applications per language (for more details, see Sharma Grover 2009 ). 4.2.3 HLT component indexes The HLT Component Index provides an alternative perspective on the quantity of activity taking place within each of the data, modules, and applications categories on an HLT component grouping level (e.g. pronunciation resources), and is calculated as follows:
Maturity Index 9 The HLT Component Indexes for all languages are plotted in a grid using a bubble plot. The value of the HLT Component Index for a particular component grouping determines the size of the bubble; i.e. the higher the index, the larger the bubble. However, it is important to note that the size of the bubbles plotted within a plot is proportional to the highest value of the HLT Component Index within the entire plot. Thus, this index provides a relative comparison of the HLT activity within the various groupings of data, modules or applications within a single plot, as opposed to an absolute comparison of languages.
 For the sake of brevity, we present here only the plot for the HLT Component Indexes for applications (see Sharma Grover et al . ( 2010b ), or the supplementary online resources 10 for plots for data and modules). Figure 2 illustrates the HLT Component Indexes for text (in blue) and speech (in red) applications. The greatest quantity of activity (more mature and accessible) is in the reference works (text) for Afrikaans and English, as well as in telephony-based services in English. There is some medium-scale activity in the document production, translation, CALL, and accessibility areas for the text and speech domains, respectively. A number of speech-based applications have very few activities in English, Afrikaans and IsiXhosa, since these applications are in their early development phases. The remainder of the South African languages do not have any activity in terms of speech-based applications.
Based on these plots, one could also perform a gap analysis, which could serve to identify gaps between the current status and the prioritised components (Sect. 4.1 ). This information could be highly informative for future road-mapping exercises, as well as to immediately identify areas or languages that should receive particular attention. (For examples of such gap analyses, refer to the supplementary online resources. 11 ) 4.2.4 HLT language index The  X  X LT Language Index X  provides a comparison on the overall status of HLT development for the eleven South African languages, and was calculated by summation of the Maturity Index and the Accessibility Index 12 for each language (across all HLT components): HLT Language Index  X  Maturity Index  X  Accessibility Index per language  X  X  X  5  X  This index allows languages to be compared against each other based on the total quantity of HLT activity within a language whilst also taking into account the stage of maturity and accessibility of the outputs of the HLT activity. In interpreting the results of the  X  X LT Language Index X  it is important to note that statistical data analysis is unsuitable, since there are a relatively small number of items available per language. Thus rather an impressionistic representation of the HLT landscape is being portrayed through this index. Also, the limited number of items available per sub-category makes the data analysis subject to significant changes if additional items are identified for a language.

Figure 3 depicts the HLT Language Index for the South African languages. It shows that Afrikaans is by far the most developed language in South Africa with regard to HLT LRs and applications, followed by the local vernacular of South African English (with a significant difference between the two). This picture is slightly skewed by the fact that very little work on South African English is required within the text domain, which means that South African English will almost always only be measured in terms of activity related to speech technologies.

Based on the above, our overall impression of the South African HLT landscape is that very few basic LRs and applications exist across all eleven languages; unsurprisingly, it is especially the four smallest languages that lag far behind in terms of HLT development (see Sect. 5 for an explanation). It is also clear that there are a great many areas that lie fallow in terms of the variety, number and maturity of items, especially compared to other world languages.
 5 Discussion and recommendations Although this audit was conducted in South Africa, lessons learnt could be applied to other similar contexts, especially to developing countries and resource-scarce environments. The discussions and recommendations that follow focus on the South African audit and context, but could be extrapolated easily to other settings.
SAHLTA X  X  findings reveal that whilst there is a considerable level of HLT activity in South Africa, there are significant differences in the amount of activity across the eleven languages, and in general the language resources and applications currently available are of a very basic nature. In reflecting on these findings, several factors need to be considered holistically in order to understand the current HLT landscape in South Africa.

South African HLT role-players and stakeholders are faced with the challenging task of balancing political needs (i.e. to pay attention to all official languages equally) with economic viability (i.e. to create a thriving HLT industry, where there is return on investment on the HLT outputs produced for a certain language). A number of recommendations can be made for accelerating HLT development in South Africa:  X  Resource development and distribution: From the gap analysis, it is easily  X  Funding: The principal sponsor of HLT development in the country thus far has  X  Industry stimulation programmes: Besides funding, government needs to ensure  X  Collaborations: Closely related to the above-mentioned stimulation pro- X  Human capital development (HCD): The shortage of linguistic and HLT  X  Cultivation of niche expertise: It was observed from the audit results that a 6 Conclusion Besides the audit findings, we also learnt a number of lessons on how an HLT audit should be conducted, especially in a developing, multilingual context. For example, this audit confirmed once again that measuring quality and other subjective dimensions is a time-consuming, costly and effortful process, requiring dedicated human resources. These constraints might dictate a more abbreviated and superfluous process; however, we are of the opinion that an audit should gather as much detailed information as possible on several audit dimensions. For a participant to merely state that a certain LR exists, does not give an impression of how mature this LR is, and could therefore skew the results if one wants to get an impression of the depth and breadth of an HLT landscape, especially in a resource-scarce context.

Data collection through the audit questionnaire proved to be a major burden. We recall that for the Dutch BLaRK, a checklist approach was followed, while a number of field workers were used to gather information (Binnenpoorte et al. 2002 ). However, the financial scope of the SAHLTA did not allow for the luxury of field workers, and we therefore had to use a comprehensive questionnaire instead. In hindsight, we have to draw the conclusion that the audit questionnaire might have been too cumbersome in terms of the number of information fields required from the participants. In many instances the compulsory information required for an HLT item (e.g. technical description) was not easily accessible or available on-hand for the participant, or if a LR was out-dated or not well-documented, then it was even more challenging to gather information about it. Thus, if one cannot use field workers, one should rather opt for a simpler check-list approach; the qualitative data might then be less informational (e.g. not have information about performance, or file sizes, or related publications), but one might get data more easily.

In addition, we also experienced that, despite monetary incentives for primary participants, the response rate was in some cases rather slow/low. In personal communications with such participants, it became apparent that they either did not value the true contribution of such a detailed audit, or that they were reluctant to share information because they were uncertain what the implications of it might be. national HLT database that captures this information (which would be freely available for their perusal), did they become more active in their participation.
In hindsight, we have learned that an audit like this should follow a bottom-up approach: if the community does not share an understanding of the real value of such an audit, or if they do not have a real need to get access to the results of such an audit (e.g. a national database, or the potential to get funding), the process is hampered considerably.

We therefore also conclude that it is imperative that data should be captured in a national, online database that is freely accessible by the local and international HLT community, and that it is kept up to date on a regular basis. Such a database can be used for a number of purposes, such as road-mapping exercises, networking and identifying collaborations, determining availability of LRs, gauging the gaps in HLT development for a language, and setting funding priorities. In this regard, the South African National Centre for HLT could play a pivotal role in keeping the information for South Africa updated. In addition, it could play a role in helping to international LR infrastructures (such as the ISCA 14 special interest group on speech and language technology for minority languages and AfLaT 15 ).

Technology audits are primarily used as tools for further planning around a technology domain. In this paper, we have presented an audit methodology for codifying knowledge about the HLT domain. We have explicated a process that could be repeated in other contexts/countries, and described some of the instruments (e.g. questionnaires, indexes, etc.) through which data could be captured and presented. In our opinion, one should strive to do a once-off extensive audit like this; after that, auditing should be organic, supported by good governance and buy-in from the community.
