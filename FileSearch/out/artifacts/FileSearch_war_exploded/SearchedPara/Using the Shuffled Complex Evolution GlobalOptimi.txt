 Two types of methods are used to solve management models: numerical meth-ods and non-numerical methods. The latter are used more widely because they don X  X  rely on continuity and derivative of the objective functions. According to the characteristics of decision variables X  change, the searching process of non-numerical methods can be divided into two types: one is to search in definite direction and the other is to search randomly. The first type method includes steepest descent method, simplex downhill[1], etc.. The characteristic of this type non-numerical method is that the direction of each searching step is definite, so the search is easy to stop at local optimu m. The characteristi c of the second type non-numerical method, such as genetic algorithm[2], simulated annealing[3], etc., is that the direction of each step of search i s stochastic, therefore the search can converge to global optimum or at least near-global optimum[4].

Due to the development of computer science, now more and more attention is paid to the result of optimum methods instead of the calculation velocity. There-fore, non-numerical methods, which are able to converge to global optimum, such as GA, SA, etc., are more and more used [5-15]. Combing two stochastic non-numerical optimization methods GA and SA, Wu Jianfeng et. al[14] developed a new optimization method of the genetic algorithm based on the simulated annealing penalty function (GASAPF). Based on the GA, this new method handles constrains of management models by simulated annealing, and it avoids the complexity of selection of penalty fa ctor in the traditional GA method. The GASAPF has been used to solve groundwater management problem successfully and proved to be better than the traditional GA[14,15].

Different from the GASAPF, which combines two types of stochastic non-numerical methods, the SCE-UA method combines directio n-searching of de-terministic non-numerical methods and robustness of stochastic non-numerical methods. A new concept, shuffling complex, is introduced to the method. The SCE-UA method is capable of handling nonlinear optimization problem with high-parameter dimensionality and derivative of the objective function is not nec-essary. The SCE-UA is a very effective and efficient global optimization method and has been used successfully to calibra te many types of watershed models[16-25]. For the first time, the SCE-UA method is applied to solve the groundwater management models in this paper and results are very satisfying. The SCE-UA method was developed by Duan et. al. at the University of Ari-zona in 1992. It is a global optimization strategy designed to handle the various response surface problems encountered in the calibration of nonlinear simulation models, particularly the multilevel optima problem encountered with Concep-tual Rainfall-Runoff (CRR) models. This method combines deterministic and stochastic strategies and it is based on a synthesis of the best features from several existing methods, including the genetic algorithm and simplex downhill search scheme. On the base of competitive evolution, the SCE-UA method in-troduces a new concept of complex shuffling. This method is capable of finding global optimum and it does not rely on the availability of an explicit expression for the objective function or the derivatives.

The core ideas of the SCE-UA algorithm include competitive evolution and shuffling complex. A general description of steps of the SCE-UA method is given below.

One key component of the SCE-UA method is the CCE algorithm, as men-tioned in Step (5). This algorithm is based on the Nelder and Mead (1965) Simplex downhill search scheme[1].
 Flexible and robust features of probability approach are utilized in the SCE-UA method because the search begins with a randomly selected complex of points spanning the entire feasible space R n . A large enough number of points will help ensure that the complex contains information regarding the number, location and size of the major regions of attraction and the search can operate in the whole sample space. In the process of g enerating sub-comp lex, competition make the points with better value of objective function, be selected as parents with more possibility. In the process of evolution of sub-complexes, deterministic information of response surface is us ed effectively in the SCE-UA method. All these speed up the search to the di rection of global improvement.

In a word, deterministic information leads the search to the direction of global improvement. The strategy of competiti ve evolution and complex shuffling in-herent in the method help to ensure that the information contained in the sam-ple is efficiently and thoroughly exploited. These properties endow the SCE-UA method with good global convergence properties over a broad range of problems. To investigate the performance of applying the SCE-UA method to solve ground-water management problem, a linear model to determine the maximum pumping rate and a nonlinear model to optimize determine the minimum pumping cost are used as examples.
 3.1 Linear Optimization Model  X  To Optimize the Maximum The first example problem is to determine the maximum pumping rate from the homogeneous, isotropic unconfined aquifer. The groundwater flow situation is adapted from Mckinney and Lin[6]. The aquifer is composed of sand and gravel. The porous medium is homogeneous and isotropic, and the hydraulic conductivity is 50 m/d. The recharge per unit area is 0.001 m/d. There are 10 potential wells extracting water from the aquifer. Plan and elevation views of the phreatic aquifer are shown in Figure 1. Boundary conditions of the aquifer include Dirichlet boundaries on the north river and south swamp, both are 20 m; and no-flux conditions on the east and west sides of the aquifer due to the mountains. Assuming that the Dupuit assumption is valid, the partial differential equation describing groundwater flow can be given as area recharge rate ( L/T ).
The object is to maximize the total pumping rate from 10 wells in aquifer, subject to the constraints that the hydraulic heads at the wells must be nonneg-ative and each pumping rates must be in the range of 0 to 7000 m 3 /d. Due to steady flow, the optimization model can be expressed as
The values of hydraulic heads in the constraints are calculated by the ground-water simulation model (1) using the current values of the decision variables, the pumping rates. In order to compare results of different optimization methods, like Mckinney et. al . [6], a standard finite difference method used to solve the linear equation set derived from groundwater flow model (1) in terms of h 2 subject to the current boundary conditions. Values of parameters are given as n =10 ,m =21 ,q =11 , X  =1,  X  = 21, p = 25.
 The results of solving the maximum pumping rate example using the SCE-UA method, the LP, the GA and the GASAPF are given in Table 1. The hy-draulic heads at wells and hydraulic head contours corresponding to different total pumping rate using the GASAPF and the SCE-UA method is shown in Table 2 and Figure 2, respectively.

It is obviously from Table 1 that the total maximum pumping rate calculated by the SCE-UA method agrees more closel y with the LP solution, which is almost equal to global optimum, than that calculated by the GA and the GASAPF. The hydraulic heads at wells shown in Table 2 and hydraulic head contours in Figure 2 indicate that results from the SCE-UA method satisfied constrains of the optimization model better than that from the GASAPF. All these show that the SCE-UA method can be used to solve the linear groundwater management model effectively and efficiently. 3.2 Nonlinear Optimization Model  X  To Optimize the Minimum The second example is to determine the m inimum cost (capital and operating cost) of installing and operating wells to supply a given, exogenous, ground-water demand of 30,000 m 3 /d from the unconfined aquifer shown in Figure 1. Basic conditions of the nonlinear optimization model, such as the property of the aquifer, boundary conditions and the distribution of wells, are the same with those of above linear optimization case. The response of the aquifer to pumping at 10 potential well locations in the aquifer is predicted by the finite difference model described above. The objective of t he nonlinear model is to minimize the total cost (include fixed cost of drilling wells and pumping equipment, and the operating expense of wells) of the wells subject to the constraints that the total pumping rate from the aquifer must satisfy the demand, the hydraulic head at wells must be nonnegative and individual pumping rates must be in the range of 0-7000 m 3 /d to prevent aquifer dewatering. The model can be written as[6] where a i i =1 , 2 , 3and b i ( i =1 , 2) are constants given in Table 3. d i [ L ]isthe depth of a well at location i and h i is the hydraulic head at well i . The first term on the right-hand side of the objective function is the fixed cost of drilling a well at location i , the second term represents the capital cost of the well and pumping equipment, and the third term is the operating expense of the well.
The minimum cost model is a nonlinear fixed charge program. Using gradient-based nonlinear programming algorithms to solve problems with this type of objective function caused two serious co mputational difficulty[6] without modi-fication or approximation. To prevent this computational difficulty, b 1 and b 2 are commonly set to 1 instead of their true v alues. This simplification has been used here in order to compare the nonlinear programming, the GA and the SCE-UA method solutions. However, it is not necessary for the GA and the SCE-UA method.

The nonlinear programming, GA and SCE-UA solutions to the minimum cost pumping example are presented in Table 4. Comparatively the pumping rate from the SCE-UA method agrees best with the constraint equation and the total cost from this method is minimum. Furthermore, the SCE-UA pumping rates are symmetric due to the symmetry of the aquifer system. The symmetric solution is not particularly exciting but provides a check on the search accuracy and validity of the algorithm. All these show that the SCE-UA solutions are more perfect than the NLP X  X  and the GA X  X  for the nonlinear groundwater management model. For the linear optimization model, solution of the SCE-UA method is very sim-ilar to that of the LP, which means solution of the SCE-UA method is almost converge to the ideal global optimum, and better than the Shuffled results of the GA and GASAPF..For the nonlinear optimization model, results from the SCE-UA method are more close to the global optimum than those from the NLP and GA. All these show that application of the SCE-UA method to solve management models is effective and efficient.

The SCE-UA method combines direction -searching of deterministic non-numerical methods and robustness of stochastic non-numerical method, and practical results of this method agree better with the global optimum than that of the GASAPF, the method which only combines two types of stochastic non-numerical methods.

Parameters of the SCE-UA method can be selected easily and the physical characteristic of these parameters are definite while the choice of crossover and mutate probability of the GA is difficult and subjective. So artificial effect of optimization results due to selection o f parameters can be decreased or avoided in some degree by using the SCE-UA method.

The SCE-UA method has the virtues of no n-numerical direction-searching method and the robustness of non-numerical stochastic method. The global op-timum can be reached and continuity and derivative of the objective function is not needed. One can foresee that the SCE -UA method can be applied widely in the hydrogeology field, such as water resources optimization, pollution preven-tion and optimization problems with high-parameter dimensionality.
