 Social media such as Twitter has come to reflect the reaction of the general public to major events . Since posts are short and noisy, it is hard to extract reliable events based on word frequency. Even though an event term appears in a particularly low frequency, as long as at least one reliable user mentions the term, it should be extracted. This paper proposes an event extraction method which combines user reliability and timeline analysis. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model is adapted with the weights of event terms on timeline and reliable users to extract social events. The reliable users are detected on Twitter according to their tweeting behaviors: so cially well-known users and active users. Reliable and low-frequency events can be detected based on reliable users In order to see the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a Korean tweet collection; the proposed model achieved 72% in precision. This shows that the LDA with timeline and reliable users is effective for extracting events on the Twitter test collection.

Event Extraction; Timeline Analys is; User behaviors; Latent Dirichlet Allocation In recent years, media has become an important source of real-time information. People use social media to communicate, socialize, debate and engage in arguments. With the rapidly increasing amount of data on soci al networking service (SNS) like Twitter, researches on event extraction are attracting more and more attention. Compared with news and blog data, SNS data are more widely used in real-time event extraction. However, as the amount of data increases, noise also increases, creating a need for a reliable event extraction method. There are researches on effectively analyzing diversity of tweets and inferring the occurrence and magnitude of an event [2, 3, 5]. Since event extraction methods [6, 7] typically depend on term frequency, it is possible to mi ss important information when extracting events from Twitter. This is especially true if retweets are not pertinent to an event, such as a rumor, spam or advertisement, all of which are common in the SNS environment. In order to reliably extract reliable low-frequency events as well as high-frequency events, two type s of reliable users should be included in the event extraction method: the active user and the socially well-known user. Active users are valuable users because they post important information every time an event occurs. On the other hand, if a socially well-known user mentions a particular event, it indicates that a significant social event occurred. In addition, the events themselves ha ve important features. The day a new event occurs, certain terms may be used more frequently that day compared to other days. User s will also use Twitter to express positive or negative opinions about particular issues or events. Our model uses a sentiment lexicon to consider the context of an event term which contains users X  opinions. A number of studies have been conducted on various forms of social media. Tinati et al. [8] developed a model based on Twitter message exchanges which ma kes it possible to analyze conversations about specific topics and identify key players in the conversation. Sayyadi et al. [7] developed a new event detection algorithm creating a keyword graph and using community detection methods analogous to those used in social network analysis in order to discover events. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model [1] provides a principled way to discover hidden topics from large document collections. However, standard topic models do not consider temporal information. In the recent research on LDA, the topic model [2] considers both the tem poral information of microblog posts and users X  personal interests. This paper proposes an event extr action model, which is a Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model based on timeline and user behavior analysis. Timeline and user reliability analysis are applied to the standard LDA model [1] to cover multiple events occurring on the same day. A sudden increase in topically similar posts usually indicates an event. Event terms are extracted using the chi-square test and opini on scores to show how term distribution is related to timeline and user sentiment about a specific event. The reliable users are detected on Twitter according to their tweeting behaviors: socially well-known users and active users. The proposed model is novel in that it combines user reliability and timeline analysis to extract event topics. To see the effectiveness of the pro posed model, experiments are conducted on a Korean Twitter te st collection. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents our event extraction model; Section 3 describes experi mental results. Finally, we conclude in Section 4. This section describes the overall structure of the proposed method as shown in Figure 1. The method consists of a topic discovery step and an event filt ering step. In the topic discovery step (section 2.1), a topic model is proposed that considers both timeline (section 2.1.1) and user reliability (section 2.1.2). Event filtering is performed with a similarity-based clustering and user reliability-based filtering method (section 2.2). This section describes the event term extraction method based on the LDA topic model with time and users. The purpose of using the LDA model is to cover multiple events occurring on the same day. This is in contrast to basic event extraction methods, which are based on term frequency and therefore cannot extract multiple events occurring on the same day. Timeline and user behavior analysis are critical properties in the event extraction method. When a new event occurs on a certain day, there is typically a large occurrence of certain of certain terms on that day compared to other days. In order to give dis tinctive weight to an event term, term significance can be calculated based on timelines. In addition, when an event occurs, generally public is informed about it by authority users, or through mass media, or through normal users on Twitter. Each time an event occurs there are some users who tend to write profusely about the i ssue. Such users are concerned about the issue for a long time and may publish valuable information on that issue. Thus, it is important to detect accurate and reliable users in order to extract accurate and re liable events. In the proposed model, the LDA m odel is adapted with timeline and user reliability analysis to extract event topic groups (Figure indicates the additional weight of each term on time t , and  X  denotes the additional weight of each user. The topic distribution of each user  X  is drawn from a prior Dirichlet distribution Dir(  X  ), and each document word w is sampled from topic-word distribution  X  specified by a drawn from the topic-user distribution  X  . Figure 2. Graphical representation of TimeReliableUser LDA Collapsed Gibbs sampling was used to perform model inference. Due to space limitations, only the derived Gibbs sampling formulas are shown, as follows: where z i = j represents the assignments of the i th word in a word. ChiOpScore is the additional weight of m th word in the lexicon on time t . AuthScore denotes the additional weight of n th user. The range of ChiOpScore and AuthScore are (0,1]. Furthermore,  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  is the number of times word m is assigned to topic j , not including the current instance, and  X  instance. The proposed model is similar to the model proposed by Diao et al . [2]. The primary difference between the two is that, they assume a pair of posts published around the same time is more likely to be about the same topic than a random pair of posts. Here, term significance for a given day is measured by the chi-square statistic, which measures the lack of independence between a term and the date. Another difference is that they compare a post with its publisher X  X  general topical interests observed over time. If a post does not match the user X  X  long-term interests, it is more likely related to a global event. In this paper, reliable users are concerned to extract an event. Then, if the reliable users post event. In addition, the model by Diao et al . extracts an event by two Poisson distribution. The prop osed method extracts social events based on topic term clustering and reliable users based filtering. When a new event occurs on a certain day, there may be a high occurrence of certain terms on that day compared to other days. The term significance is measured by the Chi-square statistic, which measures the lack of independence between a term and the date. Users write tweets to express their opinions on particular issues or events with positive or negative sentiment words. A sentiment lexicon is used to detect the context of an event term which contains the user X  X  opinion. Event terms are extracted by combining the Chi-square value ( ChiSq ) and opinion score ( OpScore ) to show how term distribution is related to the timeline and user sentiments for a specific event, as follows (s ee more details in [9]): where w is a bigram word, t 0 is a particular date, and empirically. OpScore is measured by combining the frequency of a term and the frequency of opinion words. The ChiOpScore value TimeReliableUser LDA model to account for the impact of event terms. When an event occurs, generally the public is informed about it by authority users, or through mass media, or through normal users on Twitter. In addition, each time an event occurs there are some users who tend to write profusely about the issue. Such users are concerned about the issue for a long time and may publish valuable information on that issue. For example, weather information from the official Tw itter account of the National Weather Service is accurate and reliable. Similarly, it can be quick and reliable to get the latest information about iPhones from the official Twitter account of Apple. Thus, it is important to detect accurate and reliable users in order to extract accurate and reliable classification of Twitter users. In our model, users are categorized as either socially well-known users or active users. If a socially well-known user mentions a particular event, it indicates that an important social event occurred. Highly active users, on the other hand, post important information whenever a new event occurs. Both of these groups are cons idered reliable users. Generally, socially well-known user s on Twitter tend to have a large number of tweets and retw eets. A HITS algorithm [4] was adapted to extract socially well-known users by applying mentions, RTs (modified retweet), and retweets as an edge weight between user nodes.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X   X   X   X  X  X  (3)  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X   X   X   X  X  X  (4) The edge weight w qp is as follows:  X   X  X   X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X , X   X   X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X , X   X   X  X  X   X  X  X  (5) The 5 users with the highest AuthScore values are considered socially well-known users. These users generally post profus ely about a given topic and related events, and thus are typically more active than other users. The following formula calculates the average weekly activity score. where W show the number of weeks; TweetFreq shows the sum of tweets d that a user u wrote in the i th week; RTFreq represents the week. The distribution of reliable user tweets about earthquakes and the number of news articles about earthquakes on a given date are shown in Figure 3. The number of tweets about an earthquake, the tweet distribution of the top 5 reli able users, and the number of news articles about the earthquake all have very similar patterns. Peaks on the graph labeled by date represent the occurrence of earthquakes. An increase in daily tweet frequency indicates that all reliable users wrote abou t an issue on the same day. Figure 3. The number of tweets containing a word  X  X arthquake, X  the distribution of reliable users and the number of earthquake related news articles. The top 5 reliable and highly active users for the term  X  X arthquake X  are shown in Figure 3. User 1(Korean Red Cross) wrote tweets not only about the earthquake itself , but also about ways to donate or help. In contrast, user 5 (Min istry of Foreign Affairs) posted tweets that include guidelines for South Korean citizens who live in abroad, while users 2 (KBS news) and 3 (journalist) provided earthquake-related news. The five users with the highest activity score are selected as active and reliable users. Both socially well-known users and active and reliable users are classified as reliable users. These reliable users are selected as input data  X  for the our LDA model. The results of the TimeReliableUser LDA model can include similar topic groups and noisy, high-frequency event terms which are not related to the event. Thus, the extracted events are filtered by user data from reliable and highly active users. Ideally, this process will give a lower rank to highly frequent but unrelated event terms, and a higher rank to frequent but important event terms. The system creates 20 topi c groups for each day and each topic group has 20 words and 20 users. Duplicate topic groups were removed by applying the cosine similarity measure, which measures the similarity between tw o vectors by finding the cosine of the angle between them. The process is as follows: Step 1 : Compute similarity score be tween each topic-word group Step 2 : Compute similarity score be tween each topic-user group Step 3 : If the average similarity scores of each topic-word pair and topic-user pair are greater than the threshold, then group them together (single link clustering). Step 4 : Select a topic-word group as an event group if a topic-user group includes reliable users. The threshold of cosine similari ty for clustering topic-word groups was set at 0.5 based on re sults from the qualitative analysis and analysis of the number of topic pairs. The event topic group filtering process is shown in Figure 4. In Figure 4, the first step provides several topics and each topic group has an associated probability score. The number of topic group sets is obtained after measuring cosine similarity between the topic groups. Finally, the to pic groups are filtered by reliable users or author reliability score. Even if an event term has a particularly low frequency of occurrence, as long as at least one reliable user mentioned the term, it can be extracted. The effectiveness of the proposed method of tweet collection was evaluated as follows: Four topics were selected, and tweets related to these topics or events were co llected from November 1, 2010 to March 26, 2011 by Twitter API (all tweets are written in Korean). Table 1 shows the number of tweets related to each issue and 41 social events for the four issues. Each record in this tweet data set contains the actual tweet body and the time when the tweet was published. Park Ji-Sung 29,568 131,533 12 First, the model filtered out st op words and extracted nouns and verbs using the Korean POS(part-of-speech) tagger. After preprocessing, the proposed method created a word pair of features in each tweet by usi ng a bigram with 3 window size. Comparison methods for event extraction are as follows:  X  Standard LDA: Original topic model 1 [1]  X  BurstTimeUser LDA: LDA with time and users to find  X  TimeReliableUser LDA: The proposed model based on Two human assessors judged the answers for the result topics by each method on the particular dates which an event occurred. The ten dates in average are selected according to the number of news articles on the issue. After preliminary experiments, the number of topics was set at K to 20,  X  to 0.01 and  X  to 0.01, empirically. The TimeReliableUser LDA was run for 500 iterations of Gibbs sampling, with time T spanning from November 1, 2010 to March 26, 2011 for a total of 147 days. Table 2 shows experimental resu lts on 41 events, with the number of answers detected out of the total number of answers for each event. Evaluation process is as follows. Each model gives 20 topic groups on particular day. He re, the proposed model gives clustered topic groups with reliable user groups. When the number of tweets is less than other day, the proposed model gives two or three topic groups. And when the numbers of tweets are high then the model gives some topic groups which have similar user groups. The baseline LDA model achieved 55%, BurstTimeUser LDA achieved 63%, and the proposed m odel, TimeReliableUser LDA, achieved 72% in macro average precision. Our model outperforms other models in precision and recall. This shows that timeline and reliable users played an effective role on event extraction. We show some sample results fr om our experiments and discuss some case studies that illustrate the advantages of our model. Examples of the extracted event groups are shown in Table 3. The topic labels are manually assigned. Each topic group consists of top words and top users. Each topic is shown with five words and users that have the highest probability conditioned on that topic. As shown in Table 3, the first and second topic groups are event groups because those groups include reliable users. Third topic groups are also event groups, but the system could not retrieve them. The reason is that groups are not including reliable users. However similarity-based cluste ring gave us meaningful topic groups and it reduced the topic groups depending on the event type. This paper proposed an event extraction method based on a timeline and user behavior analysis in LDA on Twitter. On the TimeReliableUser LDA model, event candidate terms and reliable users were reflected by term significance and user activity measurements. Similar topics are clustered by measuring term relevance and by considering reli able users. The proposed method achieved 92% average precision in the top 10 results. The study findings show that using the T imeReliableUser LDA model with reliable users can increase the effectiveness of event extraction. Future research should focus on methods for better event expression and less dependency on the number of tweets.
