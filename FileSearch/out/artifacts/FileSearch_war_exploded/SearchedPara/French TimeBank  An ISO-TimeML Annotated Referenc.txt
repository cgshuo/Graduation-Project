 The processing of temporal information (events, time expressions and relations between these enti-ties) is essential for overall comprehension of nat-ural language discourse. Determining the temporal structure of a text can bring added value to numer-ous NLP applications (information extraction, Q&amp;A systems, summarization...). Progress has been made in recent years in the processing of temporal data, notably through the ISO-TimeML standard (ISO, 2008) and the creation of the TimeBank 1.2 cor-pus (Pustejovsky et al, 2006) for English. Here we present the French TimeBank (FTiB), a corpus for French annotated in ISO-TimeML. We also present the methodology adopted for the creation of this re-source, which may be generalized to other annota-tion tasks. We evaluate the effects of our methodol-ogy on the quality of the corpus and the time taken in the task. ISO-TimeML (ISO, 2008) is a surface-based lan-guage for the marking of events ( &lt;EVENT&gt; tag) and temporal expressions ( &lt;TIMEX3&gt; ), as well as the realization of the temporal ( &lt;TLINK&gt; ), aspectual ( &lt;ALINK&gt; ) and modal subordination ( &lt;SLINK&gt; ) relations that exist among these entities. The tags X  attributes capture semantic and grammatical features such as event class, tense, aspect and modality, and the type and normalized interpretative value of tem-poral expressions. The &lt;SIGNAL&gt; tag is used to an-notate relation markers, such as before and after . A set of resources for English has been developed over the years, including an annotated corpus, TimeBank 1.2 (TB1.2) 1 , which has become a reference for tem-poral annotation in English. We propose a number of improvements to ISO-TimeML to deal with as yet untreated phenom-ena. These include both cross-language annotation guidelines, as well as guidelines specific to French. All these guidelines are implemented in the FTiB. Cross-language Improvements : ISO-TimeML currently provides for the annotation of event modality by capturing the lemma of a modal on a subordinated event tag in the modality at-tribute. Inspired by the fact that in French, modal-ity is expressed by fully inflected verbs, we pro-pose that those verbs be tagged as modal, and we provide a set of normalized values for the modal-ity attribute, within a manual annotation context, that reflect the classic classes of linguistic modality (Palmer, 1986): NECESSITY and POSSIBILITY (epistemic), OBLIGATION and PERMISSION (de-ontic). We also provide a way of capturing the dif-ference between support verb constructions with a neutral aspectual value ( mener une attaque ( carry out an attack )) and those with an inchoative as-pectual value ( lancer une attaque ( launch an at-tack )). ISO-TimeML encodes the relation between the verb and its nominal argument via a &lt;TLINK&gt; of type IDENTITY . We encode aspectual variants in the FTiB by using an &lt;ALINK&gt; . A signifi-cant proportion (13/36) of the annotated &lt;ALINK&gt; tags in the FTiB (36%) are used in this case. A third improvement we propose is the introduction of the event class EVENT CONTAINER 2 to distinguish predicates that take an event nominal as subject. In TB1.2, these predicates were sometimes marked, but not distinguished from the OCCURRENCE class. The distinction is appropriate as these predicates have events as arguments, unlike OCCURRENCE s. The relative frequency of this class (19 occurrences) compared to the standard PERCEPTION class (10) also justifies its use. Although not yet dealt with in ISO-TimeML, aspectual periphrases , such as en train de + V inf ( akin to the English progres-sive -ing ), adding an aspectual value to an event, are captured in the FTiB in the aspect attribute for events. We also propose a new value for as-pect, PROSPECTIVE , encoding the value of the construction aller + V inf ( going to + V inf ), as in le soleil va exploser ( the sun is going to explode ). Improvements for French : a correspondence had to be made between the ISO-TimeML schema and the grammatical tense system of French, in particu-lar, to account for tenses such as the pass  X  e compos  X  e ( PAST tense value, as opposed to the present per-fect used in English) and imparfait ( IMPERFECT , not present in English as a morphological tense). French modal verbs behave differently to English modal auxiliaries as they can be conjugated in all tenses, fall within the scope of aspectual, negative polarity and other modal operators. Unlike in TB1.2, modal verbs (and adjectives), are marked &lt;EVENT&gt; in FTiB and have the class MODAL . 72 events (3.4%) are annotated with this class in the FTiB. Text sampling : the source texts for the FTiB were selected from the Est R  X  epublicain corpus of journal-istic texts. 3 The journalistic genre was chosen for its relatively high frequency of events and temporal expressions. Texts were sampled from 7 different sub-genres 4 , the distributions of which are shown in Table 1. Certain sub-genres appear in higher pro-portions than others, for two main reasons. Firstly, to favor comparison with TB1.2 (which is made up of news articles). Secondly, because the news gen-res are relatively diverse in style compared to the other sub-genres, which follow a certain format (e.g. obituaries). We present some of the correlations be-tween sub-genre and linguistic content in Section 5. Automatic pre-annotation : To speed up the an-notation process, we carried out an automatic pre-annotation of markables (events, temporal expres-sions and some relation markers), followed by man-ual correction. Relations were annotated entirely by hand, as this task remains very difficult to automate. Below we describe the two modules developed for pre-annotation.
 The TempEx Tagger marks temporal expressions &lt;TIMEX3&gt; and sets the tag X  X  attributes, and anno-tates certain &lt;SIGNAL&gt; tags. This module con-sists of a set of Unitex (Paumier, 2008) transduc-ers that are applied to raw text. We adapted and enriched a pre-existing set of transducers for anno-tating temporal expressions in French (Gross, 2002) for our purposes. Marked expressions are classified according to their ISO-TimeML type 5 and the val-ues of certain attributes are calculated. The value attribute is only set during normalization, carried out after the detection phase. A script calculates normal-ized values for marked expressions, including index-icals, such as lundi dernier ( last Monday ) or l X  X nn  X  ee prochaine ( next year ) (with the article X  X  publication date as reference point). A comparative evaluation with the DEDO system of (Parent et al, 2008) shows very similar performance (for exact match on tag span and for the value attribute) over the same evaluation corpus (Table 2).
 The Event Tagger marks up events ( &lt;EVENT&gt; tag) and certain relation markers through the application of a sequence of rules acting on the local chunk con-text. The rules eliminate unlikely candidates or tag appropriate ones, based on detailed lexical resources and various contextual criteria. Input is a text pre-processed with POS tags, morphological analysis and chunking (carried out with the Macaon process-ing pipeline (Nasr et al, 2010)). A reliable com-parison with the DEDO system, to our knowledge the only other system for this task in French, was unfortunately not possible. Evaluations were made on different, yet comparable, corpora, so results are merely indicative. For event tagging, our system scored a precision of 62.5 (62.5 for DEDO), recall of 89.4 (77.7) and an F-score of 75.8 (69.3). There is room for improvement, although the system still yields significant gains in total annotation time and quality. An experiment to evaluate the effects of the pre-annotation showed a near halving of annotation time compared to manual annotation, as well as a significant reduction of human errors (Bittar, 2010). Unfortunately, it was not possible to reliably com-pare the performance of the Event Tagger with the similar module by (Parent et al, 2008) (DEDO), to our knowledge the only other system developed for this task for French. Evaluations of each system were carried out on different, although similar, cor-pora. Thus, results remain merely indicative. For the task of event recognition, our system scored a preci-sion of 62.5 (62.5 for DEDO), recall of 89.4 (77.7) and an F-score of 75.8 (69.3).
 Manual annotation and validation : after pre-annotation of markables, texts were corrected by 3 human annotators (2 per text), using the Callisto 6 and Tango 7 tools, designed for this task. Figure 1 shows the process undergone by each document. The final step of the process is a coherence check of the temporal graph in each document, carried out via application of Allen X  X  algorithm (Allen, 1983) and graph saturation (Tannier &amp; Muller, 2008). Us-ing the same method, we found 18 incoherent graphs among the 183 files of the TB1.2 corpus for English. At this stage, the corpus contained 8 incoherencies, which were all eliminated by hand. Manually elim-inating incoherencies is an arduous task, and per-forming an online coherence check during annota-tion of relations would be extremely useful in a man-ual annotation tool. All files were validated against a DTD, provided with the corpus. Our aim for the FTiB is to provide a corpus of comparable size to TB1.2 (approx. 61 000 to-kens). Version 1.0 of FTiB, presented here and made available online 8 in January 2011, represents about 1 4 of the target tokens. Figure 2 shows that proportions of annotated elements for French are mostly very similar to those in TB1.2. This sug-gests the annotation guidelines were applied in a similar way in both corpora and that, for the journal-istic genre, the distributions of the various marked elements are similar in French and English. By far the most common relation type in the French corpus is the &lt;TLINK&gt; . Among these, 1 175 are marked between two event arguments ( EVENT-EVENT ), 722 between an event and a temporal expression ( EVENT-TIMEX3 ), and 486 between two temporal expressions ( TIMEX3-TIMEX3 ).
 Inter-annotator agreement was measured over the entire FTiB corpus and compared with reported agreement for TB1.2. 9 . F-scores for agreement are significantly higher for the French corpus on &lt;EVENT&gt; and &lt;TIMEX3&gt; tag spans than for TB1.2, and very slightly lower for &lt;SIGNAL&gt; . Fig-ures for tag attributes are higher for TB1.2, as a much looser metric 10 was used for agreement, so comparison is not yet possible. The same measure will need to be implemented to afford an accurate comparison. Sub-genre and linguistic content : a preliminary study showed correlations between the various sub-genres chosen for the corpus and the annotations in the texts. For example, Figure 3 shows a high proportion of TIME s in announcement texts (46% of the corpus total) 11 , while DURATION s are in-frequent (2%), but appear in higher proportions in news (21 X 32%) and sports (13,5%). DATE s are by far the most frequently marked (80%), with SET s being the least. In Figure 4, the preponderance of the OCCURRENCE class is obvious (62.1% of all events). REPORTING is most frequent in local and international news. Announcements stand out yet again, with the highest number and highest propor-tion of the class EVENT CONTAINER . These ini-tial observations argue in favor of text sampling to achieve a diversity of temporal information in a cor-pus and suggest such features may prove useful in text classification. Our experiences show ISO-TimeML is a stable lan-guage and, with some modification, is applicable to French. The FTiB is a valuable resource that will surely stimulate development and evaluation of French temporal processing systems, providing es-sential data for training machine learning systems. An initial survey of the data suggests temporal in-formation may be useful for text classification. Our methodology is time-efficient and ensures data qual-ity and usability (coherence). It could be adopted to create temporally annotated corpora for other lan-guages as well as being adapted and generalized to other annotation tasks.
