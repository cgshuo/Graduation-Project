 Granovetter [4] introduced the concept o f strength of ties in his landmark paper  X  X he Strength of Weak Ties X . Strong ties connect people you really trust, and those whose social circles tightly overlap with yours. Often, they are also the people who are most like you while weak ties are merely acquaintances.
Weak ties often provide people with acces s to information and resources out of their own circles [3] while strong ties have greater motivation to be of assistance and are typically more easily available [3]. So the study of social ties can bring lots of benefits to daily life [10, 5] which is well worth working on. However, in most studies of social network, social co nnections are often presented as being friends or not, neglecting the difference between strong and weak ties. And the problem hasn X  X  been well explored yet.

Previous studies have investigated the strength of ties, e.g., by exploiting human annotation as training data [2, 6]. The problem is that performance largely depends on the quality of annotation. At the same time, they treat the problem as a binary classification task, i.e., to classify a relationship as strong or weak and were not able to quantitatively estimate the strength, which limits the scope of their contribution in real world. In this paper, we harness the homophily principles and empirical analysis to develop a latent variable model for estimating tie strength based on user similarities and social interactions. Comparing to the existing methods, the proposed method requires no human annotation, and the outputs are real numbers (instead of 0 or 1) representing the strength of ties.
To evaluate the proposed method, we conduct experiments on data collected from Sina Weibo 1 , and experimental results demonstrate that our model out-perform previous methods. Further, with the method to calculate tie strength, we investigate the phenomenon of social triads. In sociology a triad is a group of three people which is mostly investigated by microsociology. We examine social triads and our findings are consistent with Granovetter X  X  conclusion [3].
The rest part of this paper is organized as follows. We review the related worksinSection2.InSection3,weintro duce the framework of measuring the strength of ties in social network. In Section 4, we show the experimental results of our work. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude and talk about future work. Some recent efforts have been made on th e task of measuring the strength of ties. Most of them focus on supervised model which involves efforts on human annotation [2, 6]. However, measuring the strength of ties is only treated as a binary classification task by these works, i.e., to classify a relationship as strong or weak and they were unable to quantitatively estimate the strength between different users. Zhao et al. [13] proposed a novel framework for measuring the relationship strength between different users on various activity fields in online social networks. However, it only repre sented the strength of ties on various activity fields rather than the overall relationship strength.

The most relevant work was proposed by Xiang et al. [12] which is a latent variable model that measures the strength of ties by outputting continuous values without human annotation. User similarity and social interactions are exploited while constructing the model. Our model is the same with it in the aspects mentioned above. However, there are several differences: 1)we consider both user similarities and social interactions as d ecisive factor of tie strength while they only considered user similarities. 2)The way in which we utilize social interactions is rather different. In our work, we believe that social interactions directly impact on the strength of ties and it in turn impacts on the interaction probability of the user pairs in the future. In the previous work, researchers believe that the strength of ties impacts on the interaction probability of user pairs all the time. Experimental results confirm that our model outperforms the previous methods.
At present, there has been work concerning about triads. However these works either investigated the n etwork structure using social triad theory [11, 1] or studied the triads composed of positive and negative edges(friends and ene-mies) [8] in social media . To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first that investigates the triads whose edges are measured by strength of ties. One key assumption is the theory of homophily [9]. It postulates that people tend to form ties with other people who have similar characteristics. Moreover, it is likely that the stronger the tie, the higher the similarity. Therefore, we can model the strength of ties as a hidden effect of user similarities.

Another assumption is that the frequen cy of social interactions between user pairs directly impact on their strength of ties. Since each user has a finite amount of resources (e.g., time) to form and maintain relationships, it is likely that they direct the sources(interac ts) towards the ties that they deem more important [12]. As a result, user pairs with strong ties are more likely to interact in the future. On the other hand, it can be inferred that user pairs with more social interactions in the past are more likely to form strong ties between them. In this way, we model the strength of ties as the hidden cause of users X  future interaction probability and the hidden effect of the users X  historica l social interactions. Graphical model representation of the tie strength model is shown in Fig. 1. 3.1 Model Specification Formally, let s ( i,j ) be the attribute vectors of two individuals i and j which rep-resents the user similarity and social interactions between them in the past. Let z ( i,j ) be the hidden strength of ties between i and j . Interactions between them are divided into t categories(e.g., in weibo system, interactions can be divided into mention, retweet, comment, reply and so on), and let y ( i,j ) m (1  X  m  X  t ) to be the probability of whether the m th kind of interaction would happen in the last month. The model can be viewed as a hybrid of discriminative and generative models: the upper part is discriminative ( p ( Z | S )), while p ( Y | Z ) is generative. Our model represents the possible casual relationships among these variables by modeling the conditional dependencies, so it decomposes as follows: The general latent variable model of tie strength can be instantiated in dif-ferent ways and we adopt the Gaussian distribution to model the conditional probability of the tie strength given the vectors of the similarity and historical interactions information. Then the dependency between z ( i,j ) and s ( i,j ) is : where s ( i,j ) is n-dimensional, w is a n-dimensional weight vector to be estimated, and v is the variance in Gaussian model which is configured to be 0.5.
The probability distribution of each y ( i,j ) m given z ( i,j ) is considered to be con-ditionally independent. y ( i,j ) m (1  X  m  X  t ) is the probability of whether the m th kind of interaction would happen in the last month. For example, y ( i,j ) m may denote whether i has commented on j  X  X  statuses in the last month. We use logistic function to model the conditional probability of y ( i,j ) m given z ( i,j ) : where  X  m (1  X  m  X  t )and b are the parameters estimated to adjust the proba-bility of y ( i,j ) m given z ( i,j ) . b is defined to be zero for simplicity.
The data are represented as N user pair samples, denoted by D = { ( i 1 ,j 1 ) , ( i 2 , j observed variables, based on Eq.(1), the joint probability is as follows:
P ( D | w,  X  ) P ( w,  X  )= P ( y, z, w,  X  | s ) Finally, to avoid over-fitting, we put L2 regularizers(i.e.,  X   X  and  X  w )onthe parameters w and  X  , which can be regarded as Gaussian priors. z ( i,j ) , w and  X  are unvisible, so the task can be modified as to find point estimates w, z,  X  that maximize the likehood P ( y, z, w,  X  | s ) 3.2 Inference Taking the logarithm of Eq.(4), we get the log-likehood: Note that both the quadratic terms and the logarithm of logistic function are concave. Since the sum of concave functions is concave, the function L is concave. Therefore, a gradient based method will allow us to optimize over the parameters w,  X  m ( m =1 , 2 ,...,t ) and the latent variables z ( i,j ) , ( i, j )  X  D, to find the maximum of L . We derive a coordinate ascent method for the optimization.
The coordinate-wise gradients are: A coordinate ascent optimization scheme will update w, z ( i,j ) ,and  X  m iteratively until convergence. For z ( i,j ) and  X  m , we use Newton-Raphson update in each iteration, where the 2nd ord er derivatives are given by: For w , the root of Eq.(8) can be found analytically as in usual ridge regression:
Implementing the model , given y ( i,j ) and s ( i,j ) , we can gradually obtain the parameter w ,  X  and z ( i,j ) ( continuous). So the problem can be solved. Algorithm 1. The process of the Newton-Raphson update 4.1 Model Evaluation The experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset crawled from Sina Weibo using API 2 . Since two-way communication are mostly be observed between bi-followers 3 , we focus on ties between bi-followers in the experiments. We recruits several people to label the category of ties(strong or weak) between them and their bi-followers. The criterion of human annotation is based on the definition of strength of ties proposed by Granovetter [4] talked about in Section 1. Then we crawl data, extract features, and apply our model to the dataset. Meanwhile, the human annotation results are not used while calculating the strength of ties.
To evaluate the model, we use the continuous value obtained to identify whether a tie is strong or weak. The accuracy and AUC of the classification task are used to evaluate the model since there are no o ther criterion suita ble for it. Several baselines are compared with our model. One is the model proposed by Xiang et al. [12] referred as UBL model here. One use s social interaction features to classify while the other exploits both social intera ction and user similarity features. They are referred as UC model and UIC model respectively while our model is referred as UIBL model. The experiment results are shown in Fig. 2(a).

From the result, it can be seen that our model outperforms the others on both criterions. Despite of the fact that our model and UBL model are quite similar 4 to some extent, our model increases the accuracy of it by 6 percent and achieves much better in AUC mainly for the effect of historical social interactions on tie strength that has been into account. Although UIC model has exploited all the features of our model as well as the results of human annotation, it is still beat by our model on both criterions. We explain it for that theory of homophily and essence of tie strength are taken into account while proposing our model. In other words, we exploited the inner relat ion between features and tie strength rather than just training based on the features and training set. 4.2 Statistically Analysis on Social Triads Relations between social media sites often reflect a mixture of friendly and an-tagonistic interactions [7] while in social network, it often reflects a mixture of strong and weak ties. Different from triads signed in social media [8], we classify edges of triads based on the strength of t ies. The edge(tie) in social triads can be classified to three categorie s, strong,weak and atypical 5 . Triads with atypical ties are not considered in experiments. In this way, social triads composed of strong and weak ties can be classified into four categories shown in Fig. 3.
WeusesnowballsamplingtocrawlthedatafromSinaWeibo.Werandomly pick up several celebrities as seed , utilize snowball sampling to crawl all their bi-followers and repeat it several times. Since users are more likely to be friends with people of common interests , the datasets can be seen as communities composed of celebrities in one field to some extent. By choosing celebrities from Sports, Technology and Entertainment field as seed respectively, we obtain three datasets of celebrities in different fields which are r eferred to as dataset Sports, Technology and Entertainment. Statistics of them are shown in Fig. 2(b).

We conduct several experiments to reveal the phenomena behind social tri-ads. Significance level(  X  ) are defined to classify between strong , weak ties and atypical ties. It is denoted by k%(0  X  k  X  100). We sort ties by their strength in ascending order, and considere that the first k % ties are strong ties while the last k % ones are weak ties. The others are atypical ties. In this way, the strong ties and weak ties we defined here are si gnificantly strong or weak ties when  X  is small. In the experiments, we gradually take k as 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 for study.
Fig. 4 shows changes of triads in proportion when  X  varies. They appear to be similar for different datasets. When  X  is less than 0 . 15, there are only triads with three strong ties since few weak ties make up triads then. When  X  increases from 0.15 to 0.30, triads with three strong ties remains the most. So we can infer that triads with three strong ties are more likely to form. Meanwhile, the number of triads with two strong and one weak tie is much smaller which matches with the theory of sociology that your friend X  X  friend are more likely to be your friend. In this paper, through leveraging user si milarities and social interactions, we propose a latent variable model to calculate a continuous value that measures the strength of ties. Our experiments show that using this model to identify whether a tie is strong or weak gives rise to better performance than baselines. Further, we utilize our method to measure the strength of ties among a large set of microblogging users, and conduct statistical analysis on triads. We find that comparing to other types of triads, the one with three significantly strong ties are more likely to be created. It is consistent with Granovetter X  X  conclusion, which confirms the effectiveness of our model from an alternative point of view.
In the future, we will consider about applying it to different social net-works,constructing bigger data set and proposing a more effective model.
