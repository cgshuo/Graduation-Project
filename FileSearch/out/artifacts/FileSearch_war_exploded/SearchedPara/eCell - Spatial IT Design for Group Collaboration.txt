 In this paper we present the eCell; a temporary, collaborative niche for group work in school envi ronments. The eCell consists of a private inner display and a public outer display located in unused public spaces e.g. in corridors and libraries throughout the school premises. The inner disp lay is a large touch-sensitive screen connected to a standard computer. The outer display con-sists of a projection on a large semitransparent surface. Com-bined, the two displays compri se an IT-supported, collaborative environment especially suited for project based education. Through three iterations of design, we describe the technological, the spatial and the educational as pects of the eCell and outline its potential for supporting collaborative activities in a temporary niche, in which the architecture of the school itself reflects ongo-ing work. Thus, the eCell stimul ates knowledge sharing, aware-ness and social interaction among pupils and teachers who are part of the school community.

Project work, collaborative envir onments, IT supported education, eCell. The Danish elementary school sy stem is changing as new educa-tional visions are gaining ground and shaping pedagogical strate-gies and practice, and technologi cal advances introduce new tools for learning. The Danish Ministry of Education state in their vi-sions for learning in elementary schools in the year 2010 a num-ber of qualifications they consid er important for the pupils to acquire, e.g. learning to navigate in increasingly heterogeneous sources of information, collabora tion and fellowship, participation and responsibility, and problem solving and knowledge sharing [38]. To support these issues, we see a general movement within the educational practice of the elementary schools towards inter-disciplinary project work where the pupils collaborate in semi-autonomous groups. The project work aims at creating involve-ment and relevance in relation to the surrounding environment, drawing on resources from society as well as school facilities. Moreover the project work form is characterized by reaching beyond the traditional boundaries of the classroom calling for a more flexible use of the school X  X  physical space and resources. The pupils move between different locations, e.g. classroom, li-brary, hallway etc., utilizing ava ilable resources and transporting materials across locations. We thus need IT systems that will support education, particularly project work, in the learning environments outside of school as well as in the classroom, that will support pupils in being knowl-edge producers rather than passive receivers and that will support teachers in acting like coaches rather than lecturers. In order to support collaboration within the pr oject group, we see a powerful advantage in utilizing the physical spaces of the school and create a more flexible learning environment through supporting the forming of temporary spaces for collaboration. Furthermore, the movement towards integrating t echnology in educational practice emphasizes the need for environm ents that support collaboration on digital materials that transce nd the practice of pupils sitting in front of a traditional PC. In this context, technology becomes an enabling resource that supports the pupils and teachers in working together. We find the work of Dourish [10] essential on this point, particularly with res pect to the role of com putation and com puter s ystem s as :  X ...a medium to orient design to wards certain pers pectives and opportunities. It highlights the active nature of com puter sy stem s tions of independent agents, but as augm entations and am plifica-tions of our own activities. This encourages a focus not on the capabilities of the technology per se, but on how that technology is embedded into a set of practices. X  ([10] , p. 166) Thus, the primary focus for technology in general and this paper in specific becomes how it support collaboration and human-human interaction, a viewpoint also taken by [25] , who empha-sizes that as technology pervades our every day lives, interaction des ign needs to be concerned with how people interact with each other in situations where technology is part of the environment to as high a degree as with inte raction with the technology . In this paper we present the eCell; a tem porary collaborative niche for group/project activities in school environm ents, consist-ing of a private inner display and a public outer display . The in-spiration for the eCell cam e from num erous vis its to Danis h ele-mentary schools who, with a few exceptions, share the architec-tonic characteristics depicted in Fi gure 1: long, straight and often wide hallway s with entrances to the clas sroom s. Figur e 1  X  unuse d public spac e in a Danish pr imar y sc hool We saw an opportunity to reclaim this space for project activities and envisioned how technology could transform these unused public spaces into flexible spaces for learning and s haring infor-mation. In the following, we present the concept of the eCell, both in terms of supporting collaboration during group work as well as awareness of the ongoing activities of the living school. Thus, with this paper we presen t a des ign cas e that explores the use of IT to support collaborative group activities in school envi-ronm ents through m indful consideration of the phy sical space. In the following we will trace the ou tlines of research related to the issues we are dealing with, w ith respect to the eCell. In par-ticular, we shall look at research dealing with collaboration around large display s and research dealing with the role of phy si-cal space or architecture in th e support of collaborative work. The body of research done with regards to collaboration around large dis play s and their im pact on learning as well as the com mu-nity in which they placed is vas t. W e have chos en to focus on two aspects that are of particular im portance to the eCell: collabora-tive, collocated learning vs . rem ote learning and awarenes s and social interaction. Our study of the eCell is a first step towards building collabora-tive learning environments and supporting modern day pedagogi-cal methods and in this respect it is im portant to position it within the collaborative learning research area. However, we will not discuss the pedagogical impact of the eCell in this paper as our primary focus is the design process. Rem ote learning has been the focus of many res earch efforts within the CS CL res earch com munity as networked com puters provided learners with the possibility to contribute to a com mon learning environment without being phy sically present together. E.g. web support for learning has been on the agenda in the com-puter supported learning com munities (CSCL, EdMedia) for many years, introducing a number of primarily administrative systems for sharing documents and awareness about classes and group work [7] [17] [18] [27] and examples of how collaborative technologies can create virtual classrooms [26] or 'Resource Rooms' [23] . Other sy stems for remote collaborative learning environments use a strong didactic focus as the point of departure, e.g. [1] or focus on promoting social awareness in learning com-munities like the Viras sy stem [30] . eLearning has thus been pri-marily concerned with developi ng advanced technology for sup-porting dis tributed, rem ote learning becaus e the gain and flexibil-ity of this area is so obvious. However, more efforts are being put into investigating how in-formation technology may also improve collocated, collaborative learning becaus e there is equally m uch to be gained from enhanc-ing the current learning practices through mindful development of technology to support collaboration in the primary schools. [37] propose tools for supporting young children (9  X  10 y ears old) in cooperating with each other as well as reflecting on what they  X  X e doing. [34] provides an excellent study of how technologies such as large screen display s and handheld devices impact children X  X  face-to-face collaboration and s tres s the im portance of des igning flexible hardware and software . We find both these studies of learning support very im portant and will strive to address sim ilar challenges in later studies of eCell use. Finally , moving into a work setting we find a rare example of large screens supporting co-located collaboration in small groups, namely the semi-public display s presented in [19] . The focus of the semi-public display s is to support an informal awareness within a tightly -knit group. This example leads us to the next category of related work: awarenes s and s ocial interaction. Another branch of research in collaboration around large displays is concerned with how to support awareness of the social-as well as work-activities that goes on within a community and thus strengthen the feeling of belonging to the community and the social interaction which takes place within the community. One of the first awareness systems that was put to the test in a large or-ganization was the Portholes system [9] that maintained distrib-uted awareness via periodically updated images of colleagues working on two different continents. Since then, we have seen fine examples of systems that support awareness by simple means, e.g [3] that shows that a low-bandwidth connection such as application sharing can communicate the presence of another person and aid in problem solving to a degree that is comparable to video, the Peepholes system [14] that introduces  X  X ow cost X  iconic presence indicators to support awareness or, the Elvin/Tickertape system [12], that introduces an unobtrusive text-based general purpose notification service. Naturally, awareness systems based on richer, multimedia representations have also emerged, like the collages in the What X  X  Happening system [40], the Notification Collage [15] or PlasmaPoster [6]. We have found a lot of inspiration in these systems even though their means for supporting awareness far exceeds our current needs with respect to the eCell functionality. A very interesting example of how to support social interaction in an educational environment is presented in [4]. The Dynamo sys-tem is a public interactive surface placed in a communal area that allows people to show and share di gital information via a range of different devices such as USB pens and digital cameras. Their study is a fine example of how new technology is used and adopted over a period and used for various purposes by the high-school students, and we recogni ze many of the aptly observed lessons in the tests we have done with the eCell. However, the Dynamo system differs from the eCell on at least one important issue: the purpose of the Dynamo system is casual exchange of private material in public and is as such a tool for social interac-tion. In contrast, the purpose of the eCell is to support collabora-tion around school material, primarily project work in groups. The eCell thus has a clearly defined educational purpose as well as functioning as a promising tool for social interaction and the building of a community within the school. Finally, [24] presents the UniCas t, OutCast &amp; GroupCast systems: three ways of supporting informal interaction between co-workers and thus support the sense of community through awareness of what other X  X  are interested in and the social interaction it fosters. UniCast allows a user to specify topics of particular interest to him or herself, e.g. stock quotes or daily comic strips, which are presented on a peripheral display that can be attended when needed. OutCast presents information such as calendar entries, appointments or even personal we b pages on touch-screen display situated outside each individual X  X  office and can act as a source of awareness of people X  X  activities to the co-workers passing by. GroupCast is a system based on active badges allowing presence-sensing for presenting information of mutual interest to work colleagues as they pass by a large public display. We find all three systems very interesting w ith respect to supporting personal-isation and awareness, and find th e idea of displaying themes of common interest when people meet in the eCell worth consider-ing. This would, of course, require a search of the individual pu-pils X  digital material that is limited to the things the pupil has made publicly available in his or her digital school bag. However, in general we have designed the eCell with the focus on creating a loosely defined and flexible setti ng for collaboration in which the pupils and teachers are solely in charge rather than focusing on the numerous issues of adaptability and context-awareness that are definitely technically possible. The role of physical space in the support of collaborative work has been the focus for research in cooperative buildings for a decade. Excellent work has been done in the area of how embed-ded technology, including both large and smaller displays, in the physical environment may support various forms of collaborative activities, e.g. the iLand project [35], the iRoom project [21], and the Workspace project [16], and how ambient media that en-hances the physical space may support awareness and become an interface in itself [39]. Traditionally, the research has been looking at how to support office work. We are moving these issues into the realm of educa-tion, looking at how technology may support project work in small groups as well as provide a more flexible basis for educa-tion and a stronger awareness of the activities that takes place in the school environment. The focu s for the eCell is thus on how the technology enables and supports the pupils and teachers in working together rather than on the interaction with the technol-ogy. In this respect, we are very inspired by Dourish X  X  work on embodied interaction [10] but in particular by McCullough X  X  the-ory of place for interaction design as an answer to the develop-ments in pervasive computing where digital technology becomes embedded in the devices and objects we surround ourselves with as parts of our everyday lives [25]. McCullough X  X  work lies in the intersection between architecture and computing and emphasizes that interaction design needs to be concerned not only with how people understand and work with machine interfaces but also how people deal with each other in situations where interactivity has become ambient. The eCell concept is part of iSc hool project within the Centre for Interactive Spaces, ISIS Katrinebjerg; an interdisciplinary re-search centre bringing architecture, engineering, and computer science together with the research mission to create new concepts for future interactive spaces. In the following, we present the iSchool projects and our methods of work. The iSchool project is a 2-year research project running until May 2005. The project is a collaboration between academia and indus-try with the vision of developing software infrastructure, GUI X  X  and spatial concepts for new inte ractive school environments. The project aims to develop an open and  X  X luent X  information technol-ogy with sufficient accessibility and robustness to support learn-ing in and outside the physical limits of the school. To fulfil this vision, we engage in testing innovative technology to support school work that goes beyond the well-known but limited PC together with the pupils and teachers who work there on a daily basis. Thus , the projects aim s to create a learning s pace where the eve-ryday cultural com petences, the curiosity and the narrative skills and desires of children and adol escents meet the outs ide world that surrounds them , the teacher and the school. Also, both stu-dents and teachers are provided with the m eans of experiencing coherence between the us e if digital and phy sical m aterials acros s school libraries, classrooms and on fieldtrips. Details about the iSchool project can be found on our project website: http://www.interactivespaces.net/p rojects/project.php? projectId=8 We believe that good design cannot be achieved without a serious involvem ent of the teachers and pupils, who are the experts of use when we deal with teaching and learning in the schools. In the following, we will presen t out research m ethods. Our background in cooperative design [5] [13] [33] provides us with the understanding that design is a cooperative, iterative proc-ess which crosses boundaries betw een work practices and which must involve active participati on from a wide range of contribu-tors e.g. users, designers, usab ility people, engineers and archi-tects . M oreover, we are very influenced by the action res earch approach presented by Baskerville [2] that offers an exploratory framework for study ing social s ituations with em phasis on the com plex and m ultivariate nature of social settings such as the process of design. Consequently , the techniques for supporting design in interdisci-plinary groups m ust support this "m ulti-voicedness" [11] by creat-ing an open and dy nam ic des ign s pace for all s take holders . Thus , we work with m ethods that allow skilled people from the design dom ain, the use dom ain, the usability dom ain and every other relevant dom ain com e together m uch in the way Thackara de-scribes a movie crew [36] . In the iSchool project, we have sought to engage both teachers and pupils actively , m aking them equal partners in the design process on the s ame term s as other stake holders. Methodically , we use m ethods prim arily of qualitative nature [31] . In practice, we have used a com bination of qualitative m eth-ods and resources, ranging from fiel d studies, tech storms, design workshops and evaluations on s ite. The methods we employ ed during the project reflect both more traditional way s of getting insight into a use practice and introduce new use of technology to access the areas of the children' s lives we had poor or no direct access to (i.e. after-school and fam ily activities) [8] [20] [28] . Using thorough studies of presen t day school environments as input the project aims to create prototy pes of the future school environment. We experiment with phy sical as well as software prototy pes, based on our own e xperiences with the us e dom ain and bas ed on the contributions from both pupils and teachers . During the two evaluations at the elementary school, presented in section 4.2 and section 4.3, severa l m embers of the res earch team followed the projects closely , documenting the project work and making sure the prototy pes were running. Every day , we docu-mented the s etup and work in the eCell with a digital cam era, video camera and diary notes. The video material was roughly transcribed and analy sed through Interaction Analy sis Lab ses-sions [22] . Edited sections of the video was, with the photos, used as shared design material and input to re-design of the prototy pes in des ign and evaluation s essions with the teachers who validated our findings. Furthermore, we produced a DVD for each of the classes with the video material of their project work. In this section we describe th e iterative design process we have gone through to develop the eCell and the research questions we have tried to ans wer with each iteration. Our research questions for the first iteration were: can we find a com bination of existing technologies that will allow us to realize the concept of the eCell in practice. The eCell was envisioned as a flex ible IT-supported installation to be placed in the unused public spaces of the school. Our intention was to include the entire school premises in the learning environ-ment including the corridors, which initially was designed for sim ple transportation. The intention was to create a dy nam ic school environment, in which the pupils X  could claim unused space as the need occur and thereb y work with their private m ate-able to give something back to the public school environment by sharing parts of their current work with people passing by the eCell. This dichotomy of conducting private work in the public space lead to discussions about how the pupils could work in a private (and undisturbed) manner and y et contribute to the public learning environment. At an early design session we disc ussed a dual screen setup with direct projection of the activities on the inner screen to the outer (see Figure 2). The inner plas ma screen with an S martBoard Overlay (s ee further details below) acted as the private workplace for the group of pupils protected by a semitransparent diffusion screen surrounding the eCell. By experimenting with a projection on the diffusion screen, we made a visual separation of the eCell, so that by -passing people were able to see the work of the group, but not see the participants them selves . In the dual s creen s etup, the eCell acts as digital installation in the school public spaces, exhibiting current schoolwork and thereby creating a dy namic and pulsating school environment. This however led to further consid-erations on, how the children could work on the private display without feeling monitored but y et providing information to by -passers. Moving from a direct projection of the inner screen to the outer screen by letting the inhabitants of the eCell choose what to present by sending digital material from the inner to the outer screen through MediaTable/MediaWall software [29] . Thereby information were no longer automa tically copied from the inner private work zone to the outer public display , but selected by the inhabitants for publication, providing them with control of the eCell facilities. To evaluate the technical soundness of the eCell concept, we build a working but rough, full-size eCell installation in our labo-ratory . One of the is sues we faced was how to project an im age on the outer screen without being blocked by the inhabitants of the eCell. The s olution was to us e a projector that allowed vertical projection and beam the projection off a mirror. The resulting setup can be seen in Figure 4 and is described in the following. The inner display consisted of a pressure sensitive 42  X  Sony Plas-maPro PFM-42V1A/S screen in 16:9-format with a native resolution of 852x480 pixels with a touch-sensitive Sm artBoard Interactive Overlay with cam era tr acking. This setup was powered by a Dell Dim ension XPS PC and providing access to the pupils X  digital portfolios through a BlipNet access point network from Blip Sy stems and a BlueTooth dongl e. Peripheral devices include LogiTech wireless key board and mouse. (For the third iteration we replaced the wireles s key board with virtual las er key board from Hutchinson-Harbour Ring Lmt). The outer display consisted of 60 X  diffusion screen for back pro-jection (4:3 format) from Smart Technologies combined with an InFocus LP540 projector, 1700 lumen. The outer display was powered by another Dell Dimension XPS PC. As part of the evaluation of the concept, we invited 20 teachers , principals and researchers to com ment on our initial eCell setup. They found the SmartBoard easy to interact with and were gener-ally enthusiastic about the eCell as a concept and wanted to see how it would fare in practice. By conducting our full-scale experi ments with spatial IT support using off-the-shelf technology , we solved the following design issue s: Having tested the soundness of the technical setup, we could now proceed to explore the eCell concept in context. In the second iteration, our research question was how the eCell would fit into the school environm ent. Therefore, we moved the eCell prototy pe into an elementary school. 
Figu re 4 -th e res ultin g eCell s etup with in ner, ou ter s creen We conducted a two-week trial w ith teachers and pupils from two 7 grade classes, at a local elementary school. We wanted to see how the eCell would affect the school environment and whether it could find its place there, and for this purpos e we set up an eCell prototy pe in the library . As stated in the introduction, our aim was to reclaim the wide corridors as learning environm ents and place the eCell outside of the classroom, but due to directives from the fire authorities and som e unsettle d insurance concerns, we were forced to establis h the eCell prototy pe in connection to a corridor in the library . The prototy pe has some minor adjustments com-pared to the lab version, e.g. the new cas ing for the outer s creen that m akes it m obile. During the two weeks, the two classes did project work in the eCell. Each class was divided into 3 or 4 groups with 4 or 5 pupils in each. The teachers had introduced a general them e for the group work and the pupils were then responsible for choosing their own specific topic to cover during the week. The pupils and teachers used Nokia m obile phones with Bluetooth capabilities that functioned both as an acces s point to their digital m aterial on the intranet and also provided them with a handy multifunctional tool for collecting data (audio, phot os, video) when they ventured prototy pe did not allow the users to save pictures and audio clips directly into their digital portfolio from the phone, we set up an extra Bluetooth connection at one of the PC X  X  that allowed the pupils to transfer the digital m aterial to the com puter which proved to be som ewhat of a bottleneck. All the digital material was stored on a s erver placed at the Univers ity and required inter-net acces s. 
Figu re 6 -collage on th e p ublic d isplay p res entin g th e p roject Similarly to the group of people we had previously presented the eCell to, the pupils and their teachers found the touch-sensitive inner screen very easy to inter act with without formal introduc-tion. The pupils immediately st arted experimenting with the Sm artBoard functionality , drawing beards on pictures of friends, annotating material found on the inte rnet and transferring pictures from the digital portfolio to the outer s creen and to each other X  X  digital portfolio. When asked, the pupils explained that the com-bination of the fam iliarity of the traditional blackboard and ex-perience with sharing digital material on different online commu-nities shaped their interaction a nd experim entation with the new technology . We found it interesti ng that they immediately under-stood the combination of phy sical in teraction and digital material and utilized the Sm artBoard functionality . Through field studies, the groups interviewed people and gathered digital photos and wrote short notes on the mobile phones or on paper, and transferred this to their digital portfolio on return to the school. The material was then discussed, selected and re-structured in the eCell in accord ance with the them e of their as -signment. In this process, we observed that all group members took charge of the production of the final presentation by taking turns in controlling the input devices of the SmartBoard when working with the shared m aterial. The  X  X pectators X  generally stay ed on the outside of the outer screen, respecting the ongoing work inside the eCell, but would curiously peek in behind the outer screen to see who was working there now and, if they were friends with the people working in there, m aybe as k what they were doing. In general, the eCell quickly attracted a lot of attention, particu-larly after the pupils working in the eCell started presenting their material on the outer screen. Roughly 30 minutes after the pupils had been introduced to the eCell, the outer screen was covered with pictures of other pupils, th eir favourite football teams, etc. and thus becam e a surface for  X  digital graffiti X  until the pupils had finis hed their pres entations . W henever the eCell was unoccupied, other pupils would flock around the inner screen and try it out. Particularly the younger children -(7  X  9 y ears)  X  were very fascinated by the setup and gathered around the inner screen when the space was uninhabited to doodle on it. Consequently , the li-brary  X  X am e to life X  and becam e an active part of the learning environment. This trial was, however, seriously hampered by technical difficul-ties. The internet connection faile d numerous times -at one point we had no internet connection for 26 hours -making it impossible noy the res earchers m ore than the pupils and teachers who were used to work under these conditions, but which was a perpetual annoy ance. Thus we can summarise our obser vations of the employ ment of the eCell in the school context as: Having identified the potential of the eCell in the school context, we wanted to explore how the eC ell supports project work. Thus, can stim ulate group activities in the school environm ent. The second evaluation of the eCell was a three-day study in which two classes were doing a full time project assignment on the proc-ess of moving away from home. A class of 8th graders and a group of children with special learning disabilities (aged 13-16) participated in the project supported by a team of teachers coordi-nated with our research team. Both groups of children were from the same school, but had never been working together before. One of the clas ses had prior experience with the eCell. The 'leaving home' project was carried out at the same elementary school as the second evaluation and the eCell was again placed in the school library . For this project we used BlueTags as the access-point to the digital material on the intranet and a collection of mobile phones with BlueTooth capabilities as a shared resource that the groups could take with them when they went outside the school to do project tasks. The mobile phones had previously tended to take some of the focus off the task at hand so the BlueTags were chos en to replace them as prim ary ID for the pu-pils X  digital m aterial. In the 'leaving home' school project, we introduced five fictional characters, each having an archetypical economical, social and educational background. The pupils were divided into mixed groups with a special focus on one of the fictional characters. The task was to describe the terms of living for the character: Where can the person afford to live? How much can the person rent from the bank? Where will the person do the shopping? How much can the person spend every week on the household? How much can the person afford to spend on furniture for their new apartment? In the final presentation, the pupils were asked to give detailed accounts of their fictional character 's options when leaving home. Besides being enrolled in the character group, each group member participated in an expert team during the first two days. One ex-pert team specialized on doing budge ts and visited a local bank. Another expert team explored the possibilities of getting resources from the local authorities, and yet another visited some local fur-niture stores to be able to calculate the cost when buying neces-sary interior for the character's new residences. When the 'experts' returned to their respective groups, they each had a special contri-bution to the group. The 'leaving home' project was multidisciplinary. The pupils should be able to calculate a budget in a spreadsheet, formulate relevant questions and conduct inte rviews with experts, and do a 20 minutes presentation of their project. With this organization of wo rk, unplanned meetings to update and inform other group members constantly occurred which made the eCell a very popular meeting place during the project. Fur-thermore, the eCell became the centre for sharing knowledge about project tasks and experien ces and supported the groups in keeping an overview of the material they had gathered and the tasks they were working on. The teachers were particularly im-pressed by some of the pupils who, because of learning disabili-ties, often were unengaged in the school work. By giving them an expert role and new means of inte racting with the project material -e.g. writing and drawing directly on the screen and saving their notes -they took responsibility for their own tasks and further-more contributed to the project group by assuming responsibility for e.g. project management. With in the eCell we also observed several examples of pupils taking charge and tutoring other group members rather than relying on the teacher to solve problems and explain issues by means of the shared project material. In one particular case, a female pup il who was normally unengaged in school activities invited 5 class mates into the eCell to tutor them in how they could transfer pictures from a phone to their digital portfolios. Another example wa s the ongoing personalisation of the pupils X  digital portfolios. We observed the ongoing use of the eCell as an ad hoc meeting place for presenting and exchanging cool stuff for staging their personal identity in their digital portfo-lios. In both cases, the inner display of the eCell was used as a point of reference. Thus we can summarise our observations with respect to how the eCell may support and move group activities in practice: The development of the eCell was foremost a research study into the use of IT to support collaborative activities in school envi-ronments. Our intention was to create temporary private niches in the public spaces throughout the school premises as a response to the new challenges formulated by the Danish Ministry of Educa-tion in the 'Vision 2010' report (as described in the introduction). Through the iterative development of the eCell (described in pre-vious section) we investigated how spatial IT could stimulate co-located collaborative education. Our two previous explorative evaluation sessions in local schools indicate that several impact of the eCell meets the visions of the Vision 2010 report. First, Observing the group work, we experienced that the eCell stimulated collaborative collocated activities , that is oftentimes neglected in conventional class r oom learning. During our evalua-tion sessions, the pupils discussed how to approach a certain task. They framed and reframed the project tasks and eventually they specified themselves how to solve the challenges. Meanwhile, notes were maintained on the disp lay by different note-takers in the group. In general the children claimed responsibility of their own tasks, identifying not only how to solve the challenges in the project, but also which challenges to pursue. Second, the eCell c oncept stimulates knowledge sharing through-out the entire school environment. By publishing information on the outer display, the pupils shared their current work with by-passing pupils and teachers. Our evaluation sessions indicated that the material posted on the outer display roused discussions among people passing by. This kind of awareness not only brings about issues of knowledge sharing but also creates a more vibrant edu-cational environment where material and traces of past activities are shared in the public spaces of the school premises. Third, The eCell itself motivates new ways of conducting educa-tion within a school environmen t. Whereas conventional class-room learning triggers a teacher-pupil dialogue in a static special environment, the eCell invites to temporary spontaneous sessions among pupils themselves or with input from teachers/more capa-ble peers. The eCell is an example of technology that takes advantage of the unused spaces and turns them into a facility for group work. Furthermore, the eCell leaves traces of the ongoing and previous activities and consequently augments the room and gives something back to the physical environment it is placed in. Many attempts have been made to introduce IT into elementary school to support them as learning envi ronments. The majority, however, are concerned with developing software for learning environment or the pedagogical ideals, and they do not take into account how the physical environment can and should be utilized. Several aspects of the eCell are currently being developed. In the first version, the inner display c onsisted of a large touch-sensitive screen attached to a traditional PC running Windows XP. This solution provided the pupils with the possibility of using most of the applications that they were used to. This platform is however inherently designed for single user interaction and is not the ideal tool for the collaborative setting. We are currently working on systems that will support multi user interaction making it possible for the entire groups to actively pa rticipate in the activities in the eCell. Concurrently with the de velopment of this technology, we face the challenge of developing software that supports the col-laborative aspect of the eCell environment. Regarding the spatial design of th e eCell, crucial safety issues have emerged. One of the perspec tives of the eCell is to utilize some of the otherwise unused ar eas of the school public spaces. The fire authorities have relatively strict regulations regarding installations and objects that ma y hinder free passage through the corridors in the event of a fire. In accordance with this, the outer display of the eCell needs to be retractable in order to ensure free passage. We are currently working on a mechanical solution where the outer display may be retracted towards the ceiling when the eCell is not in use. In this paper we have discussed the use of the eCell to support group-based activities in schools. A ne xt crucial step in the devel-opment of the eCell would be to in itiate a research effort into the learning potential of the eCell. This study should cover whether the eCell would stimulate collaborative collocated learning in the school environment. We have obs erved that the eCell supports tutoring amongst pupils and see a potential for other learning styles than typical classroom learning. In particular, we would like to investigate further into if new technology such as the eCell may help unengaged pupils who struggle academically to partici-pate more actively in school work through this kind of technol-ogy-supported group work. We have not yet data to provide a valid answer to these claims. This work has been supported by Center for Interactive Spaces, ISIS Katrinebjerg (Project #110). We are furthermore indebted to the pupils and teachers at Vesterg X rdsskolen in  X rhus for their valuable evaluation and design ideas for the first version of the eCell. Finally, we want to acknowledge the work of Andreas Lykke-Olesen and the researchers of the iSchool project. [1] Abowd, G. D (1999). Classroom 2000: An experiment with [2] Baskerville, R. (1999).
