 City happiness index is a popular indicator to reflect happiness of the residents in a city. With over half the world X  X  population now living in urban areas, and this proportion continuing to grow, cities will only become increasingly central to human society. In this paper, we introduce a new happiness index, i.e. SCHI, to reveal the true feelings of people in cities. Expression about people X  X  happiness can be got from many social networks. Recent progress of Web 2.0 applica-tions has witnessed the rapid development of microblog platform in China (i.e., Sina Microblog 1 ), where people can communica te with each other or express their feelings freely[1]. Sina Microblog pr ovides similar services as other famous microblog platforms, such as Twitter 2 . Since its launch in August 2009, Sina Microblog has grown into the biggest Chinese microblog with 500 million regis-tered users by the end of 2012[2]. There are a tremendous amount of microblogs on Sina Microblog and most of them are the ture description of people X  X  attitude towards life. Therefore, it is wise to ch oose Sina Microblog as our data source. In addition to the advantage of quantity, using Sina Microblog as a data source also makes us able to explore SCHI as a function of time, for the reason that every piece of microblog has a posting ti me. For example, we can explore which month do people feel happiest in a specific city.

Happiness is a subjective feeling of people while it is affected by objective con-ditions. Traditional methods to calculate city happiness index in China mainly consider the objective indicators of a cit y, such as GDP, healthy rate, education, green space and air quality, ignoring the subjective experience of people them-selves. Recent years, the increasing am ount of large scale user data on social network provides us a new way to evaluate happiness. In our micrblog-based method, we evaluated the happiness of a city through the self-reports(i.e., mi-croblogs) of people themselves. In orde r to calculate SCHI, first we collected large amount of microblogs posted by people who come from the same city to form a city text. Then we gave every city a score as SCHI based on the happy and sad word frequency in the city text.
 The major contribution of this paper is to propose a method to calculate SCHIs in China in terms of the analysis of public sentiment based on microblogs. After first examining happiness at the level of cities, we explored the variety of happiness with different time granularities, including month, day and hour. In this way, we showed the shift of happiness with time. At last, by analyzing the word frequency, we gave reasonable explanation of the difference between city happiness. Our study on SCHI found many useful and interesting macro-scale social phenomena. We believe that our study can provide many important social information and will do great help to bot h government and researchers, as well as millions of common people.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we introduce some related work on social network and happiness index. In section 3, we explain the computing method of SCHI based on large amount of Sina Microblog data. Section 4 first introduces the dataset of our research and then illustrates our experimentalresultsaswellastheexplan ation of discoveries. Section 5 concludes our work and makes a brief description of future work. Happiness index is becoming an important research topic in various fields. Many reports on happiness have been published by sociologists and statisticians. The UN X  X  2012 World Happiness Report attempts to quantify happiness on a global scale with a  X  X ross National Happiness X  index which uses data on rural-urban residence and othder factors[3]. In the US, Gallup and Healthways produce a yearly report on the well-being of different cities, states and congressional districts[4], and they maintain a well-being index based on continual polling and survey data[5]. Other countries are also beginning to produce measures of well-being: in 2012, surveys measuring national well-being and how it relates to both health and where people live were conducted in both the United Kingdom by the Office of National Statistics[6] and in Australia by Fairfax Media and Lateral Economics[7].

While these and other approaches to quantifying the sentiment of a city as a whole rely almost exclusively on survey data, there are now a range of comple-mentary, remote-sensing methods available to researchers. The explosion in the amount and availability of data relating to social network in the past 10 years has driven a rapid increase in the application of data-driven techniques to the social sciences and sentiment analysis of large-scale populations, such as population-level happiness measurements carried ou t by Facebook X  X  internal data team[8], work focusing directly on sentiment det ection based on Twitter[9,10]. Quercia et al.[11] found that monitoring tweets is an effective way to track community well-being in UK, as well as individual happiness. Detail researches by Dodds, Mitchell, Frank et al.[12,13,14,15] investigated the shift of happiness in Ameri-can urban areas with the variety of ge ography and time, using a service named Amazon X  X  Mechanical Turk[16].

Works related to happiness are frequen t abroad, however, there are rarely such researches published in China. Inspired by the works above, we studied the Subjective City Happiness Index of China by mining large amount of Sina Microblog data. To evaluate the happiness degree of a city in our method, first a city text is needed. A city text is formed by a cer tain number of microblogs posted by sample users who come from the same city. However, before this task, we should introduce how to score the major sentiment words for a given city text. Here we use a existing affective lexicon ontology co nstructed by the Information Retrieval Laboratory, Dalian University of Technology[17]. Originally, there are three kinds of words in this ontology - X  X ositive, negative, neutral X . We slightly modified this ontology based on our works, including: 1)removing all the neutral words, such as  X  X ure( ) X  and  X  X nderstand( ) X . 2)adding some newly appeared common words(about 50) in microblogs which are related to happiness, such as X  X ositive energy( ) X  and  X  X egative energy( ) X . For simplification, we called this modified affective lexicon ontology as MALO in the rest of our paper. There are exactly 21984 words in MALO and every word has a discrete score which is in a set of { -9(saddest),-7,-5,-3,-1,1,3,5,7,9(happiest) } . Figure 1 shows the detail word distribution of MALO on score. Every column in it represents the number of words which lie in a certain score. From Figure 1 we can see that the numbers of happy and sad words are generally the same on every corresponding absolute score, so that there is no happy or sad bias in MALO itself.

Importantly, with this method we make no attempt to take the context of words or the meaning of a text into account. While this may lead to difficulties in accurately determining the emotional content of small texts, we find that for sufficiently large texts this approach nonetheless gives reliable results. An anal-ogy which was used in [14] is that of temperature: while the motion of a small number of particles cannot be expected to accurately characterize the temper-ature of a room, an average over a sufficien tly large collection of such particles nonetheless defines a durable quantity. Furthermore, by ignoring the context of words we gain both a computational advantage and a degree of impartiality; we do not need to decide a priori whether a given word has emotional content, thereby reducing the number of steps in the algorithm and hopefully reducing experimental bias.

After having the happiness score of b ase words, next we selected a certain number of microblogs from every sample user, and city texts are formed by the microblogs posted by users who come fr om the same city. Then for a given text T containing N unique words, we calculate the subjective happiness h sub by where f i,T is the frequency of the i th word w i in T for which we have hap-piness score h sub ( w i ), and p i,T = f i,T / N i =1 f i,T is the normalized frequency of word w i .

Another task left is to choose an appropriate quantity of microblogs to form a city text. To reduce the personality factor of people, as well as considering the major quantity of microblogs posted by a user in a year, we selected 100 microblogs from every user. If a user X  X  microblog number does not reach 100, we selected all. Figure 2 shows the SCH I values of different user numbers and every curve in the figure represent a ci ty in China. The figure shows that the SCHI value becomes stable when use r number reaches 20000. Recent works by Dodds et al.[18] have proved that human languages(including Chinese) reveal a universal positivity bias. Their conclusion coincides with the trend of the curves in Figure 2. We also analyzed the sentiment distribution of top N(N=200, 500, 1000, 2000, 2500) frequent words in city text of Beijing, and results are shown in Table 1. From the table we can see that the percentage of happy words is bigger than that of sad words. Therefore, we believe that with the rising of the user number, the SCHI value will keep incr easing slowly. However, the result is meaningful as long as we choose the same user number for all cities, and the number is fixed at 25000 in the rest of our paper.
 Our dataset contains totally 1.3 billion microblogs posted by 1.1 million users from 36 major cities, in which we selected 55 million microblogs(all posted in 2013) and 0.9 million users in our research. City information of users can be got in the user table of the dataset. In this paper, we assume that most microblogs of a user are posted in the city which he belongs. The detail of total microblog number, word frequency and SCHI value of every city are shown in Table 2. A difference of 0.1 in SCHI between cities is rather significant in our study. In order to reflect the difference between cities clearly, we map the SCHI values onto the China Map, which is shown in Figure 3. From the map we can see that cities in south China are generally happier than that of north. For the purpose of in-vestigating the reason of such phenomenon and exploring the influencing factors of happiness, first we calculated the Spe arman correlation coefficient between SCHI and other city indicators, including GDP, GDP per capita(GDPPC), air quality(AQ) 3 and average daily leisure time(ADLT) 4 . Spearman correlation co-efficient is commonly used in calculating the relevance of two distributions. It has two values: 1) r-value(from -1 to 1) shows the degree of correlation between two distributions and larger absolute value means more relevant. The plus or minus sign of r-value represents that whether the two distributions have positive or negative correlation. 2) p-value(from 0 to 1) shows the significant degree of r-value. Usually, we are confident to say r-value is significant when p-value is under 0.05, and very significant when p-value is under 0.01.

From Table 3 we can see that SCHI has a positive correlation with other four indicators. Particularly, the p-values of (GDP,SCHI) and (ADLT,SCHI) are 0.03 and 0.0002 which are both under 0. 05. First this means that people are more likely to feel happy if they have mor e leisure time. Meanwhile, works by Stevenson and Wolfers[19] also claim to show a direct correlation between gross domestic product and subjective well-being across American. As we all know, the economic level of south China is generally higher than that of north and recent years have witnessed a bad perfo rmance of north China X  X  air quality. On the other hand, although west China is les s developed than east, west China have a much better air quality. These factors are partly coincident with the Figure 3. After all, people X  X  feeling about happiness can not be determined by one or two indicators, it is affected by a lot of external and latent factors.

For further discussion, we compared two cities X  SCHI values from the view of words shift contribution. We define word shift contribution C T m ,T n ( w i )as follows: where T m ,T n represent two city texts. Taking Lhasa, Beijing as an exam-values. All words with nonzero C values are divided into four types, including  X  X appy word which increases X ,  X  X appy word which decreases X ,  X  X ad word which increases X ,  X  X ad word which d ecreases X  for which we use  X +,  X   X ,  X +,  X   X ,  X -,  X   X ,  X -,  X   X  to represent in the figure. The increa se or decrease here means the variety have positive contribution to the change of SCHI value. The small pie chart in Figure 4 shows the percentage of total absolute contribution of the four types, including all the words appeared. We put the original Chinese words in the bot-tom of Figure 4, for the reason that there may be some deviation in translation from Chinese to English.

Beijing is the capital, cultural and political centre of China, while Lhasa is a beautiful religion city in the west with a high elevation of 3650 metres. Compared with Lhasa, definitely Beijing is much more developed. However, the SCHI value of Lhasa is 0.11 larger than that of Beijing. From Figure 4 we can see that the happiness in Lhasa tends to be more religionary. Frequencies of words which are often appeared in religious realm such as  X  X appiness, honor, mouse and man, soul, wisdom, merits, propitious X  are larger than that of Beijing, while the frequencies of words  X  X aha, joyful, lovely, happy birthday X  are much smaller. In addition, words  X  X aze, pollution X  in Lsaha appear less than Beijing, which is coincident with the actual environment situation. Similarly, all cities in our study can be compared through words shift contribution, so that the difference between SCHIs can be explained reasonably.

Next we studied the variety of SCHI with month in 2013 by limiting the microblogs posted in a certain month, while the upper number of sampling mi-croblogs per user is also 100 as before. Six cities including Beijing, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Chongqing, Nanjing and Chengdu are randomly selected as examples. Results are shown in Figure 5. The curves in the figure show roughly the same variation trend in the whole year and most winter months have advantages in happiness compared with summer months. The happiest month is February while the saddest month lies in April, with a difference of SCHI value from 0.3(Beijing) to 0.41(Nanjing). Forasmuch the difference between two texts is quit obvious in the reasons.

Taking city Beijing as an example, Figure 6 shows top 20 words with biggest Year lies in February, and so do the Valentine X  X  Day and the Lantern Festival. Therefore, large amount of happy words r elated to the three festivals have much bigger frequencies in February, such as X  X oyful, lover, auspicious, reunion X . In the meanwhile, there are two events happ ened in April: 1)an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 happened in Ya X  X n; 2)an epidemic disease named H7N9 avian influenza was spreading in China at that time. The intuitive reflection of the two events in Figure 6 is the larger frequencies of words  X  X escue, case(of illness), virus X . However, the influence of event on SCHI has two sides. Earthquake itself is definitely a bad event for people, it will cause the decrease of happy words as well as the increasing of sad words. But in another aspect, when earthquake happens, happy words such as  X  X escue, help , love X  will increase too. In this light, although the calculation method of SCHI is simple, SCHI is indeed a reflection of many complicated factors. At last, the larger frequencies of sad words X  X aze, pollution X  in February may be caused by the fireworks in Lunar New Year. In fact, more information will be revealed if more words are shown.

In addition to 2013, we also made a gragh of 2012 for comparison as illustrated in Figure 7. Although the six curves in Figure 7 are not as regular as those in Figure 5, still many points are similar. For example, most cities have wave crests in June and November in both years, merely the wave crests are not so obvious in 2012. Another fact we should notice is that the traditional Lunar New Year in 2012 is in January, while the Valentine X  X  Day and the Lantern Festival are still in February. This is why the difference between January and February in 2012 is smaller than that in 2013. In fact, many obvious or abnormal changes of the waves in two figures are caused by even ts, festivals, climate or other factors. Here we don X  X  depict the reasons one by one because the limitation of space, however, they can be well explained by analyzing the word shift contribution.
Similar to month, we analyzed the variety of SCHI with day of week and hour by limiting the time when the microblogs were posted into a certain period, such as Mondays of year 2013. Results are shown in Figure 8, where the abscissa of Figure 8(a) is  X  X ay of week X , while the abscissa of Figure 8(b) is  X  X very two hours of day X . Generally the SCHI doesn X  X  show a significant variety in a week. Most cities are a little happier in Monday and Friday than other days of week. Amaz-ingly, SCHI is relatively larger in Monday, even bigger than that of weekends in some cities. At last, most cities sh ow the lowest SCHI in middle weekdays, including Tuesday and Wednesday. For the hours part, values in afternoon and evening are larger than that of morning, and the curves of SCHI is quite similar to the daily routine of common people. In this paper, we proposed a new index SCHI to evaluate the subjective hap-piness of cities in China. Large amount of microblogs posted by users from 36 cities were collected as ou r dataset. The major contributions of this paper are as follows: 1)reflecting the subjective happiness distribution in China by calcu-lating the SCHI values of 36 major cities. 2)analyzing the variety of SCHI with month, day of week, hour to explore the shift of happiness with time. 3)reasoning the difference between SCHIs through wo rd shift contribution. Compared with traditional methods, utilizing user data on social networks makes the computing of SCHI simpler and faster, but reasonable and effective at the same time.
Many useful and interesting discoveries have been found in our study. Cities in south China generally performs better on SCHI than that of north China. Meanwhile, subjective happiness was found to show positive correlation with GDP, GDPPC, AQ and ADLT, especially GDP and ADLT. For twelve months in 2012 and 2013, people feel happier in winter months. Holidays and big events do have a significant influence on SCHI. Another interesting phenomenon is that values of SCHI in Monday and Friday are larger than other days as well as weekends, although the advantage is small. Our research is meaningful because works about happiness index are quite few in China. Also SCHI information can provide government and sociologists many useful macroscopical data about the happiness status of China. For the majority of ordinary people, SCHI values can be good references when they choose working or living city.

In the future, first we plan to enlarge our dataset which includes both user and city numbers, for the purpose to make our research more robust. Besides the dataset, more analysis should be done on SHCI to give reasonable explanation about the discoveries we found. At last, we will extend our work to other group of people, such as people who have the same occupation.
