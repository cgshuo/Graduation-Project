 1. Introduction
Complex interactive and unstructured/semi-structured data and applications, especially in big data, present major chal-theoretical and commercial systems in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. Examples include the connections between gene combinations and physical and psychological consequences, between one X  X  personal traits or preferences in social media and one X  X  social, behavioral, attitudinal and interest attributes.

This results in a situation where learning big data is analogous to the ancient Indian parable of seven blind men encoun- X  (particularly referring here to data with complex couplings and/or mixed distributions, formats, types and variables, and unstructured and weakly structured data). Learning visible and especially invisible coupling relationships can complement and assist in understanding weakly structured and unstructured data.
 crucial for obtaining a true and total picture of the underlying problem.

 recently been recognized as enhancing social recommendation, yet it has always been a natural built-in feature of social coupling, and to effectively capture visible couplings in complex data.

In reviewing the existing literature, we unfortunately cannot find systematic methodologies and techniques in learning to address before we can think about how to capture and embed couplings in learning systems. Once these problems have but undeveloped area in computer science, to address the intricate coupling relationships embedded in complex data and paper, although coupling may be heterogeneous and involve heterogeneity in data).

Learning the above characteristics of complex couplings in big data fundamentally challenges existing learning theories able to handle the coupling complexities discussed above.

The above observations motivate this work, namely to systematically state the coupling learning problem, which clearly involves interactive, unstructured and semi-structured data. The aim of this paper is multi-fold:
High-level: build a conceptual system of coupling learning (Sections 2 X 4 ) towards a generic and comprehensive under-standing of the broad-based coupling relationships that exist in complex data and applications (especially in big data related business).

Middle-level: illustrate how to advance classic problems to another generation by incorporating coupling learning into a specific existing scientific problem such as recommender systems (Section 5) .

Low-level: showcase specific examples in recommender systems to demonstrate how couplings can be managed in practice to improve analytic outcomes (Section 6 ).

The purpose of this paper is therefore not to specify one particular technique for learning a particular type of coupling lem and build generic frameworks and examples to show possible ways to address the problem.

Accordingly, the organization of this work is as follows. Section 2 discusses the concept of coupling and major coupling forms appearing in complex data and applications. In Section 4 , the issues of modeling and measuring couplings and the curse of couplings are introduced. An example of comprehensive couplings in recommender systems is discussed in Section 5 , which presents a new theoretical framework for next-generation recommender systems. Two case studies are given in
Section 6 , one in which a coupled K-mode algorithm to identify items with strong coupling relationships is presented, and one in which couplings are utilized to improve Matrix Factorization-based recommendation. Section 7 explores the opportunities for learning couplings in data mining, text mining, information retrieval, and complex behavior analysis.
The paper is concluded in Section 8 . 2. Coupling: an important perspective The following key concepts are used in this paper:
Coupling: refers to any relationship or interaction that connects two or more aspects (which could be between inputs or between inputs and outputs).
 aspect refers to either an antecedent or a postcedent, or to either a cause or an effect.
 applied; in a practical problem such as recommender systems, entity is instantiated to respective elements, such as user, item, and rating.
 Context: refers to the surrounding environment and environmental elements.
 Property: refers to the characteristics of an entity and is interchangeable with attribute and variable. Interaction: broadly refers to invisible or visible connections that exist between two or more entities. Intra-coupling: refers to the coupling within an aspect, such as the relationship between the values of a property. Inter-coupling: refers to coupling between aspects, such as between properties.
 Coupling layer: refers to where the coupling lodges, such as entity, property, context, interaction and learning.
Coupling form: refers to the way in which coupling is presented, in terms of specific presentations, configurations, pro-files, structures, types, and/or variations of coupling.

Coupling strength: refers to the extent to which the connected aspects are bonded. Strengths may be represented in terms business values (such as economic performance between financial variables) or other metrics. The strength of couplings between two bonded aspects is sensitive to the coherence (or compactness) of its constituent forms (configurations). 2.1. The concept of coupling Coupling is a very rich concept, related to many aspect as discussed before and below.

Definition 2.1 ( Coupling ). Coupling refers to any relationship (for instance, co-occurrence, neighborhood, dependency, produced prior to, during and after a target process (such as a learning task).

 resultant outcomes (such as patterns or clusters).

The process of learning couplings further requires the following perspectives to be considered: problem domain, data pre-sentation (format), knowledge representation, and coupling characteristics.

From the problem domain perspective, coupling may present in terms of domain-specific, cross-domain, organizational, social, behavioral, cultural, or economic connections, depending on which specific areas a problem belongs to. For exam-ple, in the economic domain, different markets affect each other. Price movement in one stock market may be influenced by prices in other stock markets and other types of markets such as petrol prices, commodity prices, and exchange rates.
On the data format side, coupling may appear in different forms corresponding to diverse data formats, including numer-(2011) respectively, behavior coupling and categorical coupling between objects are discussed. From an even higher level perspective, coupling may exist between entity profiles (configurations), which may take the form of arrays, affinities, artworks, or networks.
 ical and inferential couplings are discussed for coupled group behaviors. In a mathematical way, couplings may be pre-sented as configurations, distributions, linkage, neighboring, co-occurrences, causality, correlations and dependence. of the aspects involved in a system. In addition to typical relationships such as correlations between two variables and causality between inputs and outputs, couplings may present characteristics of Simpson X  X  Paradox ( Wardrop, 1995 )or
Granger Causality ( Gujarati &amp; Porter, 2009 ). 2.2. Classic coupling relationships
The above discussions show that coupling as a concept covers, but is also much richer than, the existing terms including ical coupling relationships which are mainly addressed in statistics, mathematics, and computer science. ematical condition of probabilistic independence.

Many statistical and mathematical measures have been proposed to quantify the extent of association, correlation and dependence. Examples of such measures include the product moment correlation coefficient, the odds ratio used for dichot-omous measurements, the distance correlation, tetrachoric correlation coefficient, Goodman and Kruskal X  X  lambda, and multi-moment correlation measures, polychoric correlation for latent ordinal variables, and copula for connecting dependence between variables.

The specific meanings of the mathematical/statistical terms association , correlation and dependence have been widened to ple, astronomical associations between astronomical exposures, archeological associations between objects found together, showing connections between two or more concepts in the mind or imagination.
 pling (grouping) is a concept widely accepted in computer programming which measures the degree to which each program sign of a well-structured computer system and a good design ( http://en.wikipedia.orgwikiCoupling_(computer_program-Such software couplings do not involve analytic and learning tasks, thus they are not discussed in this paper. for measuring and analyzing object relationships. Many similarity measures have been proposed for different data presen-tations, which address object coupling in terms of major paradigms, including co-occurrence, coverage (overlapping), dis-tance (difference or dissimilarity), causality and uncertainty. Most of the effort has focused on addressing strong (also are often ignored to simplify the analytic complexity.

There are very few studies on other types of couplings, which are more be found on coupling learning from the problem domain, data presentation, knowledge representation, and coupling char-acteristic perspectives. 3. Ubiquitous couplings
In this section, we expand the above discussions on couplings, aiming to provide an overall picture of couplings wide-spread in comprehensive learning tasks. 3.1. Coupling layers coupling ( Wang et al., 2011 ), and inter-coupling appears between entities, for example, inter-attribute coupling ( Wang plings such as temporal coupling, and compound couplings (which involve multiple couplings organized in a certain way Cao (2012) and for pattern relations, refer to Cao (2013a) and Cao, Zhang, Zhao, Luo, &amp; Zhang (2011) ). age coupling. In addition, one property of an entity may more or less depend on, or influence, another property, which involves inter-property coupling between properties. For example, intra-term and inter-term coupling metrics are defined in Cheng, Miao, Wang, and Cao (2013) to disclose the semantic linkage between terms in document analysis, ficient between numerical variables, more work is needed to explore the interactions between heterogeneous properties, such as those found in multi-structured data.

Context coupling: The context surrounding an underlying learning problem may be composed of aspects supporting or and between these aspects. Capturing the couplings between entities and their contexts may occur through latent learn-ing (see the discussions about user-item couplings in Fig. 2 in Section 5 ( Cao, 2013b )).

Interaction coupling: From the interaction channel perspective, couplings may take the form of dependence, correlation, association, matching, semantic similarity, co-occurrence, neighborhood, distance, density, uncertainty, logic relation, overlapping, networking or connection. In a complex application, such interactions may occur within and between sys-tem elements, subsystems, system and context.

Learning coupling: Here, learning refers to the methods, objectives, tasks, levels, dimensions, processes, measures and learning outcomes associated with understanding a problem; accordingly, couplings exist within or between them. Typ-ical examples include ensemble clustering ( Wang, She, &amp; Cao, 2013a ) which considers couplings between clustering consider sub-patterns that are aggregated in terms of certain relations.

Limited work can be found in the literature on handling the above aspects of couplings. Addressing each of the above oretical breakthroughs. 3.2. Coupling forms
Couplings in complex data and applications may have different forms, configurations and structures, which are often mixed with each other. Such couplings may need to be explored from structural, semantic, probabilistic, mathematical, dynamic, graphical/image, and/or networking perspectives.

Different forms of coupling relationships exist in complex applications such as behavioral and social systems ( Cao, 2013b ). Following our discussions about complex relations in complex behavioral systems in Wang and Cao (2012) and pling that exists in behaviors within a social media system.

Serial coupling: There is a serial order between adjacent entities; for instance, one behavior happens after another, one item is purchased after another, or one comment in a blog triggers another comment on the same topic. Two common types of serial couplings are prefix couplings and postfix couplings, in which one entity connects to another in either a computing ( Cao, 2010; Cao et al., 2012; Cao &amp; Yu, 2012 ).
 Causal coupling: One entity causes the occurrence or dynamics of an effect or phenomenon as a consequence of another.
For instance, a large buy order triggers significant market movement or a breaking news story, causing a significant increase in discussions on Twitter. Typical causal coupling learning tasks involve the learning of causation between fac-tors (in particular entities and properties) and phenomena (such as anomaly).
 events occur at the same time, for example, two bloggers express similar comments on the same issue on different social media at the same time.
 exclusive basis; two opponent groups share different views on the same social event in a blog; or an attribute presents one particular value in a certain circumstance.

Different forms of couplings take place in different coupled objects. Couplings in numeric data are very different from coupling, pairwise coupling involving two entities, and compound coupling involving more than two entities, such as hier-can be explored. In data formation, coupling may be embedded within or between arrays, affinities such as associations, sequences, episodes, paths, artworks such as design patterns, mosaics, tessellations, and networks and graphs. In Wang
In addition, there are couplings on different levels, from value, attribute, object, method, and measure to pattern. Such couplings, which are more comprehensive and complex than correlation and association, refer to the relations that exist object, method or pattern in a problem.
 et al., 2012 ). Such couplings may take invisible forms and are thus hard to quantify. Data-driven learning of invisible relations is an important way to explore them.

Combined mining represents the effort of proposing general methodol-ogies suitable for handling couplings between different aspects.
 the mainstream focus in areas including data mining and machine learning, for instance, the multi-source, multi-database, modeling couplings, measuring couplings and the curse of coupling. 4.1. Modeling couplings
Typically, we are concerned about learning couplings at a range of levels from values, attributes, objects, methods and measures to learning outcomes (patterns). Such couplings, which are more comprehensive and complex than correlation different aspects.
 intra-property coupling. In some cases, values are dependent; that is, dependency (or broad relations) between values exist. Numeric values share different coupling types and measurements from categorical values, therefore, different met-rics need to be developed to measure value couplings. For instance, to calculate similarity between numeric values, (2013b) for numerical value coupling.) of one property on others. Couplings between different types of properties need to be considered in different ways, for dissimilarity, forming object coupling . The measurement of object coupling is achieved through coupling calculation for object properties and values. A typical challenge is the heterogeneity between objects which may be considered separately ument analysis does not have the property level, and Cheng et al. (2013) shows methods for measuring term coupling.
Method coupling: When multiple methods (which may also be called approaches, models or algorithms) are involved, dif-ferent methods may only capture a partial picture of the underlying problem, and there may be an overlapping area of different methods. This provides good reasons for ensemble learning and hybrid intelligent systems. However, the cou-pling between methods is not usually considered. Accordingly, method coupling analysis considers the coverage, difference and complementarity between methods in learning a problem. For example, in Wang et al. (2013a) we report some preliminary results on incorporating the coupling between ensemble clusterings.

Pattern coupling: Here, pattern refers to broad learning outcomes, including frequent patterns and outliers, classes and clusters identified. There may be a relationship between the patterns discovered by one method or multiple methods, forming combined patterns such as pair patterns with pairwise subpatterns, and cluster patterns consisting of multiple subpatterns, as discussed in Cao (2013a) and Cao et al. (2011) . Couplings between patterns form the basis of the need optimally contribute to the most cost-effective detection of online banking risk.
 diverse couplings discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 , here we discuss some general methodologies learned through our pre-liminary efforts in relevant areas (see corresponding references), which may be useful for modeling different types of couplings.

If the data related to a problem can be converted into an information table ( Cao, 2013b ) or multiple information tables connected with one another, then the table can be a useful tool to carry forward coupling learning. See Fig. 2 for the information table showing various couplings in recommender systems.
 method in an information table, and business objects, such as for a user or an item in a recommender system. This cap-different ratings given by different users on the same item can be treated as intra-item coupling.
Inter-coupling may be defined to catch relations between homogeneous elements , such as between samples, users and items, and between heterogeneous elements , such as between data sources, variables and methods, and between users and items coupling.

Cross-domain coupling may be specified to record coupling (including interactions and influence) from one table to another. Here, each table refers to a particular domain. For instance, coupling across user Table B and item Table C in Fig. 2 shows the relationship between users and items in recommendation.

Depending on the nature of the problem, hierarchical coupling may be considered to seize the connections between sys-tem levels, for instance, from object to object group, and from subcategory to category, as shown in Table C in Fig. 2 .
Aggregated coupling takes into account and combines all couplings, namely intra-couplings with inter-couplings, cross-domain couplings involving different domains, or hierarchical couplings rolling from a low level of couplings to higher levels of couplings. The example of coupled ensemble clustering in Wang et al. (2013a) shows a way of aggregating value coupling, property coupling, object coupling, cluster coupling and clustering coupling for coupled ensemble clustering. 4.2. Measuring couplings
In modeling couplings, a very fundamental issue is how to measure coupling strength. This involves the need to answer two challenging questions for different purposes:
Answering both questions is actually very challenging, as the concept is very new to the respective research communities, 2013; Wang et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013a, 2013b ) gives us the following pointers that may be useful in addressing the above research problems: data can be converted into an information table or multiple information tables, it is then reasonable to discuss the dif-ferent types of couplings in Section 4.1 . This exercise may help us to understand what couplings are in the data.
Classic factor analysis and descriptive methods such as PCA may be used to analyze the features/variables and feature metaphor or Simpson X  X  Paradox ( Wardrop, 1995 ) show).
 sponding similarity measures by incorporating visible and invisible couplings, as discussed in Sections 3 and 4.1 . prehensive exploration of interactions in an information table related to intra-couplings, inter-couplings, cross-domain couplings, and hierarchical couplings would be extremely useful for extracting couplings by a data-driven approach. and hierarchical couplings, by inventing new coefficient or similarity metrics, for example. extracting different forms of interactions related to data, domain, human, and organizational and social factors. This requires domain knowledge and the assistance of domain experts to specify and extract interactions known to them, and to provide hints about unknown interactions.
 way to explore the data structure and characteristics.

Once the data-driven approach works well, it is important to develop benchmarking data sets embedded with certain lev-els and types of couplings. This will lead to the development of baseline approaches.

Equally challenging is the exploration of the design for Question (2), which requires the definition of new coupling met-rics to measure specific couplings.

Correlation coefficient and distance-based similarity metrics are widely used for numeric couplings. These tools can be used to measure coupling between values, properties, objects, methods and patterns as shown in Cheng et al. (2013),
Wang et al. (2011) and Wang et al. (2013b) . In other cases, they may be expanded to capture invisible coupling and cou-pling that cannot be represented in the preferred form.

For categorical data, matching, instance-based overlapping, co-occurrence frequency etc., are typical paradigms for con-sidering coupling measurement. The different focus here may be on how to use these tools to fully disclose the hidden coupling within and between elements.
 ing such data essentially requires multiple methods to be learned on multiple sources and multiple feature sets. In addi-of different structure, with a global picture is a key problem. This may need to be considered beyond normalizing and combining individual metrics, rather than considering the coupling between the outcomes (involving pattern coupling).
For an individual learning task, coupling can be measured in terms of the respective learning methods. When ensemble methods are involved, the overall similarity measure needs to consider both local coupling-based similarity between het-erogeneous values, properties, objects and methods in a learning task, as well as coupling between several methods used for the same learning task. 4.3. Curse of coupling we can see at the moment (the complexity of the problem has not been thoroughly explored due to this issue being at such an early stage), there are several aspects that need to be considered in coupling learning.

 constructed or mined.

In addition, in complex problems such as extremely rare fraud detection ( Li, Wang et al., 2013 ), the couplings between some elements may be much weaker than others; however, they may happen to be interesting. For instance, in online bank-ing risk management, the ratio between fraudulent and genuine transactions may be 1:1,000,000. Those transactions and models may focus on capturing abnormally weak couplings rather than strong ones, so the information table based coupling learning framework may not work well.

Last but not least, the coupling learning process will undoubtedly raise many unprecedented issues and questions about couplings and coupling learning: for instance, Where are the specific couplings? What kinds of couplings are there? How can different couplings be represented? How can various couplings be measured? How can couplings be incorporated into learning models (objective functions)? Would an objective function supporting coupling learning be substantially different from existing models? If different couplings need to be considered, how can they be aggregated at the global level? How can the computational costs be reduced to make coupling learning suitable for large scale data? How can the performance of coupling learning be evaluated? retrieval and general information processing. 5. An example: couplings in recommendation
In recommender systems such as online shopping websites, online broadcasting systems, IPTV, and social media, there behavior may influence his/her friends, which further affects the behaviors of others. Item attributes such as item price ence the sale market of another. To ensure accurate recommendations, comprehensive couplings between item attributes, users, items, and between users and items need to be considered. In this section, we expand the concept of recommendation research community. 5.1. The recommendation problem 5.1.1. A new perspective recommender systems, a new perspective for recommendation learning. The recommender system problem in Fig. 2 can be represented by learning from multi-sources of couplings. As shown in Fig. 2 , assume we have three data sources: Table A which records the preference (rating) A b ; c of a user b on item c .

Table B which captures user demographic information, in which a user b is represented by user demographic properties p to p n such as name, sex, age and city.
 Table C which stores item properties q 1 to q m such as price, category and subcategory for each item c .
Further, we assume there are couplings between users and between items, as well as between users and items, thus the well. The learning of comprehensive couplings in a recommender system on such a three-source coupled data can be described as follows.
 which is the area mainly explored by the current recommender system community.

Related recommendation research on group behavior and preferences similar to those of that particular user.

Content-based filtering (CBF) involves a user X  X  comments on items, materials read or additional information such as the user X  X  blogs. This content can be manually defined as needed.

Hybrid approaches include the integration of CF and CBF in various ways such as integrating models or modeling results to generate more accurate recommendation. The hybridization may take place in parallel (CF and CBF separately analyze the and then CF is employed to make recommendations on user behavior).

Metrics and tools used for measuring recommendation quality are consistent with the approaches used. The Pearson cor-that share similar rating behavior from users without any prior information about the grouping and similarity. Many other data mining and machine learning methods are applicable for recommendation; they include Fuzzy C-means, Adaptive Res-onance Theory, probabilistic clustering (Expectation X  X aximization), Bayesian Belief Nets, Markov chains, and Rocchio classification.

More recently, recommendation researchers have become interested in group recommendation ( Hu et al., 2014 ) which focuses on group behavior analysis, and cross-domain recommendation ( Hu, Cao, Xu, Cao et al., 2013; Hu, Cao, Xu, Wang et al., 2013 ) which borrows insights gained from one domain to inform a decision on another.
So far, to the best of our knowledge, limited work has been done to incorporate couplings within and between ratings, users, items, and between users and items as shown in Fig. 2 . We undertook some preliminary work in Li, Xu, Cao, and ommendation research. 5.2. Couplings in recommender systems ifications to define the diversified couplings: indicates a matrix showing the values related to two dimensions i and j . For instance, A users and items, and a i 1 ; j 1 refers to the cell associated with user i

 Alternatively, if the non-IIDness in Table A can be or is actually overlooked, then where A i ; j represents the preference rating matrix, in which A items. 5.2.2. User couplings
Users are coupled. The user Table B consists of intra-user couplings B couplings B  X  B a  X  X  ; B e  X  X  X  . We say users are coupled, hence they are called coupled users . The overall coupling RS can then be represented as: 5.2.3. Item couplings
Similarly, items are coupled. The item Table C consists of intra-item couplings C in Table C is RS C : 5.2.4. User-item couplings
Since users and items are coupled respectively and an item is associated with one to many users, users and items are cou-pled too. This user-time coupling can be described in terms of two types: explicit user-item couplings (or subjective user-item couplings ) in Table A as discussed in Section 5.2 and implicit user-item couplings (or objective user-item couplings ) in Table D between users and items.
Although the ratings reflected in Table A are subjective, the overall rating behavior may be well supported by underlying in Table D is the product of matrix C a for specific item property q coupled user-item cell . The coupling in each cell in Table D, namely D

Implicit coupling in a user-item coupled cell D two parts: the coupling of a user i 1  X  X  specific property on all items with item property number j (1 6 j 1 6 J ); and the coupling of an item j 1  X  X  specific property on all users with the user property number i (1 6 i 1 6 I ). As a result, the implicit coupling in a user-item coupled cell is RS which is the aggregation of all user-item cell coupling in Table D: where  X  i 1  X  i 2  X _ X  j 1  X  j 2  X ^ X  1 6 i 1 ; i 2 6 I  X ^ X  1 consists of two parts: a user i 1  X  X  property-based item coupling D user coupling D e  X  X  on all user properties, which are further coupled in terms of RS where D a  X  X  represents the coupling between different item properties on a particular user property, and D coupling between user properties in terms of a specific item property.

An example in Table D in Fig. 2 is the cell CP. The full coupling in CP consists of CP all item prices in a user X  X  City, and CP e which calculates the coupling of all user cities on item property Price. 5.2.5. Aggregated coupling We have discussed above the explicit user-item couplings embodied in Table A and the implicit user-item couplings in Table D. These only reflect partial aspects of the elements that contribute to the prediction of user ratings on items.
Definition 5.5 ( Aggregated User-Item Couplings ). The aggregated user-item coupling is the combination through an aggregation function RS A  X  D  X  X  of explicit user-item couplings RS where P J j and RS D i matrix b R . For this, the complete coupling in a recommender system is embodied through four sources: coupled users in
Definition 5.6 ( Complete Coupling ). The complete coupling RS in a recommender system requests the aggregation of the actual preference RS A of a user on an item in Table A, an accumulative indication RS determined by user properties and its impact on prediction, the relation between items RS the underlying hidden yet comprehensive interactions RS D rating.

Note that RS D is not a simple matrix, because it carries much information from Tables B and C and their interactions on many different properties, at different layers and on various forms. It is in fact very complicated to obtain RS studies must incorporate the implicit interactions between properties in Tables B and C.

The above discussions about diverse couplings in a recommender system indicate a new paradigm which shifts the focus of recommendation design from understanding explicit user-item preference to considering both explicit and implicit user-generation of recommendation algorithms and systems. 6. Case study: coupled recommender systems
The discussions about learning different types of couplings in recommender systems in Section 5 inspire us to incorporate into items and creates a new coupled collaborative filtering (CCF) algorithm: Coupled K-modes (CK-modes). The second (for et al. (2013) . 6.1. Coupled item recommendation considering both intra-coupling and inter-coupling between item attributes, and aggregating them in terms of the coupled object similarity (COS) proposed in Wang et al. (2011) . 6.1.1. Measuring item attribute couplings The coupled item similarity ( CIS ) between the categorical data type of items x and y is defined as follows: d is the Coupled Attribute Value Similarity ( CAVS ) (see Wang et al. (2011) for details).

The CAVS is further described by the Intra-coupled Attribute Value Similarity (IaAVS) measuring the item attribute value into account.

For item attribute j , IaAVS d Ia j  X  x j ; y j  X  is calculated as below ( Wang et al., 2011 ), where g j  X  x  X  returns all objects with values x for feature j . IeAVS d where W  X  V k n W is the complementary set of a set W under the complete set V where g k  X  W  X  maps the value set W of feature k to the dependent object set.

Accordingly, CAVS d A j between item attribute values x j 6.1.2. Coupled K-modes
Taking the K-modes clustering algorithm as an example, we create a coupled K-modes (CK-modes for short). Let S be a gorical item features f a j 1 ; a j 2 ; ... ; a j l g . A mode of the cluster S is an item vector Q  X  X  q similarity Sim  X  Q ; S  X  between each element i of S and Q .

Within the CK-modes model, the item-based collaborative filtering is adjusted to generate the prediction on item y for an active user u based on all other items x . The prediction ^ r formula: where N is the number of joint items both rated by user u and grouped by the CK-modes algorithm, and r rating on item y given by user u . Sim  X  x ; y  X  is the coupled item similarity between items x and y . r user u  X  X  ratings. 6.1.3. Experiments
We evaluate CK-modes against several widely discussed algorithms in the recommender systems, including the user-
MovieLens data. Fig. 3 shows the throughput of all algorithms. Here, throughput represents the number of recommendations generated per second. The user-based recommendation algorithm scans the whole user-item matrix R , and its throughput does not change with the number of clusters. However, the throughput of the item-based recommendation algorithm varies with the number of neighbors selected for prediction. We plot the throughput of the item-based recommendation algorithm by setting the number of neighbors as 30, since this generates the best prediction quality.

This case study shows the potential of (and need for) incorporating coupling between item properties into item similarity butes, and their aggregation brought to the similarity analysis, the implicit coupling relationships between items are erence for items; in other words, item attributes and attribute values drive user rating behavior. user property and property values) into the user X  X  rating behavior on items. More work can be done on coupled user-item pling relationships and factors that drive a specific user X  X  preference for particular items. 6.2. Coupled matrix factorization
The basic matrix factorization approach for recommendation builds on an assumption that users are independent and ing the overall structure that relates simultaneously to most or all items.

This approach ignores the social activities between users, which is inconsistent with the reality that we normally ask media study. Social recommender systems and a variety of models have been proposed, which engage social network anal-terms of their personalized preferences and influence. Apart from this, item intra-couplings are also ignored. 6.2.1. Basic matrix factorization model
The basic matrix factorization works as follows. The matrix of predicted ratings with matrices P 2 R u 0 d and Q 2 R i 0 d , where u 0 denotes the number of users, i dimension of the latent space) with d 6 i 0 ; u 0 , and R and items. Through a gradient descent approach, the best matrices P and Q can be computed.
 Eq. (18) ( Yang, Steck, &amp; Liu, 2012 ).
 6.2.2. Incorporating couplings into matrix factorization
The basic MF algorithm directly computes the production of vectors P considered in the above basic MF.

Here, we consider the low-level interactions including intra-couplings within users and items and inter-couplings for the association between users and items. Note that here, we do not consider interactions between users and between items from the perspective of their specific properties.

A new coupled MF model is generated below by incorporating the above item/user intra-couplings and user-item inter-couplings: where d Ia u ; i represents the intra-couplings within users and items, and d
Inter-couplings: Users choose or comment on the items they like or dislike. This is reflected by the preference ratings the explicit user-item coupling (see Section 5.2.4 ), which is reflected by d
Intra-couplings: Intra-couplings here include user-intra-couplings and item-intra-couplings, for instance, an author col-couplings: reflects the friendship or social relation between users u and indicates, if item i links item j , the preference of a user u on an item i would be passed to item j .
Eq. (20) indicates that a user X  X  profile P u is somehow similar to his/her friend X  X  profile P item i , he/she may also be interested in item j which is similar to i .

Accordingly, in Li, Xu et al. (2013) , we propose a Coupled Group MF algorithm (CGMF) which also considers user grouping 6.2.3. Experiments
We use MovieLens, LastFm and DBLP. The MovieLens 10 M data set consists of 10 million ratings and 100,000 tag appli-11,946 tag assignments. The DBLP citation database contains 1,572,277 papers and 2,084,019 citations. Each paper is asso-relations such as co-authoring relations, citation relations and  X  X  X rite X  X , or  X  X  X rite-by X  X  relations.
In our experiments, the MovieLens and LastFm data sets are separately used for movie and artist recommendation, and and abstract information in the DBLP data set are explored to extract topics by LDA. Likewise, tags are used to group the to group the movies.

Fivefold cross validation is performed in our experiments. In each fold, we have 80% of data as the training set and the remaining 20% as the test set. Here, we use Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the evaluation metrics.
 where R test is the set of all pairs  X  u ; i  X  in the test set, r dictive rating.
 To evaluate the performance of our proposed CGMF, we consider three baseline approaches: CF: This is an item-based collaborative filtering method called Slope One.

BaseMF Salakhutdinov and Mnih (2008) : This method is a probabilistic matrix factorization approach which does not take social networking into account.
 SocialMF: This is the model described in Eq. (18) .

The effectiveness of each method on different data sets is shown in Figs. 4 X 6 . Our proposed CGMF method outperforms the baselines in terms of RMSE and MAE. Experimental results on the DBLP data set ( Fig. 4 ) show that CGMF and SocialMF perform much better than CF and Basic MF. Compared to SocialMF, CGMF achieves up to 4.3% improvement on RMSE, 14.7% on MAE. On LastFm and MovieLens, Figs. 5 and 6 show that CGMF also performs better than the others. This indicates that there is a possibility of improving the recommendation quality by incorporating item and user couplings into recommender systems.

This case study shows the value of and further opportunities for extracting and explicating user coupling and item cou-hidden coupling between users and between items represented by their properties and the coupling relationship between them. Such low-level coupling embodied between user (and item) property values and between properties serves as the model. Thus, the study of incorporating comprehensive coupling relationship into MF to generate a CMF is very necessary, especially for data with strong visible or invisible interactions. 7. Discussions
Coupling learning is a very promising direction in learning complex relationships between objects, properties, processes, characteristic of big data, and together with heterogeneity form the phenomenon of non-IIDness, namely non-independent throughs need to be pursued.

In our team, non-IIDness learning has become a major research direction in recent years, in collaboration with major gov-ernment and industrial partners X  data and business problems, which are certainly non-IID. We have demonstrated the effec-to the two case studies presented in Section 6 , here we discuss several such exercises. (1) Coupled clustering. In Wang et al. (2011) , a coupled K-modes (CK-modes) algorithm was designed to cluster categor-(2) Coupled text analysis. Term-term couplings are important factors to be considered in text analysis which presents as (3) Coupled ensemble learning. Couplings between different learning methods are often ignored, or replaced by simple (4) Coupled behavior analysis. Behaviors of individuals and groups are more or less related for temporal, socio-cultural learning, analytic, measurement and computational systems. The research on coupling learning essentially has great poten-learning, data mining, computational intelligence, information retrieval, and broad information processing to the next generation. 8. Conclusions
In the real world, diverse coupling relationships are embedded in every business and are associated with objects, prop-ation, correlation and dependency relationships that usually concern statistics, data mining and machine learning far more complex than widely-explored association, correlation and dependency. The fact may be that we do not have a full picture of what kinds of couplings are in a system, how they present and evolve, and how to represent, model and measure them in a learning system.

In this paper, we have conducted a high level discussion about coupling learning. Our purpose is to create a high level picture of what couplings are, why they are important, how they may present, and the issues in modeling and measuring ubiquitous couplings from a generic and comprehensive perspective. We have demonstrated several examples and case studies showing what couplings may exist and how to specify them in a recommender system, as well as illustrating how such couplings can be modeled to improve learning objectives. The discussions and exploration have hopefully high-lighted promising opportunities and prospects for incorporating couplings into advancing existing learning systems, and developing the next-generation learning, analytic, computational, and measurement theories and tools.
