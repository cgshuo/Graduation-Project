 Production and Manufacturing by Taberg Media Group AB Box 94, 562 02 Taberg Sweden We are pleased to present the papers accepted for presentation at the Student Research Workshop of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics held in Uppsala, Sweden, July 11-16, 2010. The Student Research Workshop, an established tradition at the annual meetings of ACL, offers students the opportunity to present their work in a setting embedded in the main conference and features ACL X  X  efforts to invest in young researchers who will be a part of the research community in Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and related fields in the near future. The workshop aimed at enabling students to exchange ideas with other researchers and experts and to receive useful feedback and directions for future research in an early stage of their work. We are indebted to many people who contributed to the organization of the ACL 2010 Student Research Workshop. A total of 54 students and senior researchers agreed to serve on the program committee, of which 21 were from North America, 24 were from Europe, 2 were from Middle East, and 7 were from Asia/Pacific regions. The committee members, who represented various areas of NLP and computational linguistics research, well understood the spirit of the Student Research Workshop and provided high-quality, constructive, and elaborate reviews to all students who submitted their work. We are thankful to the members of the program committee for the time they spent reading and reviewing the papers. We received 37 submissions from all over the world. Each submission was assigned to 3 reviewers, at least one of which was a senior researcher. We accepted 7 submissions for oral and poster presentation and 12 submissions for only poster presentation during a parallel session with the main conference. The presentation format was assigned based on the suggestions of the reviewers about how the work could be presented best, and does not indicate a quality difference among accepted papers. We would like to thank all students who contributed to the success of this years Student Research Workshop by submitting their research papers from a wide range of topics.
 We are very grateful to Tomek Strzalkowski and Marketa Lopatkova, our tireless faculty advisors, for organizers of ACL X 2010: the general chair, Jan Hajic, the program chairs, Sandra Carberry and Stephen Clark, the publications chairs Jing-Shin Chang and Philipp Koehn, and the local organization committee in particular Joakim Nivre, and Priscilla Rasmussen.
