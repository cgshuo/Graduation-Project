 reviews contribute to the formation of viewpoints. Detecting opinion leaders is important in promoting products and guiding public opinions. Although researchers often neglected. 
In this paper, we focus on modeling multi-themes user network of forum with (LSP-Tree) structure for representing comments in forum, measuring the similarity between comments to obtain implicit links and further detecting positive opinion leader group. Experiments show that ou r methods are effective and efficient. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the related work. Section 3 gives the problem definition. Section 4 presents various links detection concerning with multi-themes user network. Section 5 describes the process of detecting positive opinion leader group. Section 6 shows our experiment results. Section 7 concludes the research and gives directions for future studies. defined four important roles and introduced their functions. Goyal [9] proposed a method based on time window for detecting opinion leader from community. Xiao [13] proposed Zhou [15] introduced the concept of opinion networks and proposed OpinionRank identify opinion leaders for a marketing product. We [11] proposed an approach detecting opinion leader based on single theme from Sina news community. c  X  C by sentiment analysis, and the value of O Moreover, we give the following definitions. as  X  X egative link X . comment network. Then the comment network can be mapped into a user network. Definition 3 (multi-themes user network). The network can be represented with a graph UNG ( V , E ). Where E is edge set including all links of definition 1 and 2, and V is vertex set including all users corresponding every comment. select top-k users as positive opinion leader group POLG ={ u 1 , u 2 , ..., u k }. paper. (1) Detect explicit and implicit links between comments. (2) Map various links to ones between users. (3) Model multi-themes user network UNG ( V , E ) based on the links. (4) Detect POLG from UNG ( V , E ). As mentioned above, the links between comments include explicit and implicit links, and every link may be positive or negative. In this section, we obtain sentiment analysis in Section 4.1, explicit and implicit links in Section 4.2. 4.1 Sentiment Analysis for Positive and Negative Links Here we also use the same method proposed in [11] for calculating SO (orientation of each comment). The method accumulates sentiment value, and transfers orientation by negative words number. SO is 1 (positive), 0 (neutral) and -1 (negative). 4.2 Explicit and Implicit Links Detection As for explicit links, we detect them according to Definition 1, however implicit links detection is complex. In order to compare comment similarity, we propose a structure called Longest Sequence Phrase (LSP) to represent a sentence (have been partitioned into words). All LSPs compose a LSP-Tree to represent comment, and we measure similarity by comparing LSP-Trees. There are several classical phrase structures such as V+(D), V+(D)+O, S+V+(D), S+V+O+(D). We use ICTCLAS [8] to split sentences into words and extract structures of each sentence, and then construct LSP-Trees. values to the words with different pos (part of speech) for different expression ability. Verb/noun=0.7, adjective=0.5, and pronoun/adverb=0.2. For every path from root node to leaf node, the words of the path construct a weighted LSP. The Formula (1) below is used for computing LSP weight value LV . Suppose LSP-Tree1 and LSP-Tree2 are two LSP-Trees of c 1 and c 2 , c 2 is replier. We firstly find the common path cp 1 and cp 2 , and then calculate common path value CV similar to LV in Formula (1) according to LSP-Tree1. CV is the value of common path based on LSP-Tree1, and LSP-Tree2 only contributes some common paths. Finally, common path and m is the number of common paths. common path, and C threshold excludes small Sim . Both are given proper values. model multi-themes user network, and then detect POLG . 
User-Item Table containing user-value pairs is a simplified form of multi-themes only concerns with the number of links, so modeling UNG ( V , E ) maintains User-Item Table. Based on the idea, table will be updated while scanning the dataset. The weight of link between comments is mapped into corresponding users X  in the process below. content of Section 4.1 to 4.2, we give wt ij as Formula (3). the suppose is appropriate. In following, we give the algorithm as Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: Building Multi-Themes User Network; Input: multi-themes comment set C , P threshold , C threshold ; //see Section 4.2 Output: User-Item Table UT ; 
Method: 1) transfer C into XML file X ; 2) for every theme 3) {create User-item for u 0 ; 4) for every user u i ( i &gt;0) 5) {for j =0 to i -1 6) {analyze u i  X  X  comment c i aiming to u j  X  X  comment c j ; 8) or ( c i explicitly links to c j ) 9) {calculate wt ji with Formula (6); 10) modify User-Item of u j with wt ji ;}}}} As mentioned above, detecting POLG only concerns with the number of links, so User-Item Table can replace multi-themes user network. For user u , score is authority score of u . We rank users according to their score, and top-k users compose POLG . Here we download dataset from  X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X  (http://www.tianya.cn/bbs/index.shtml). By multi-themes user network model, we can detect top-k users as POLG . The results are showed in Fig.2 . Parameter k = 10, P threshold = 0.5 and C threshold = 0.65. 
We have designed experiments for comparison. In Fig.3, There are more implicit links influencing the ranking result vastly. Fig.4 shows the distribution of each leader X  X  positive, negative and neutral comments, and they usually have more positive and neutral comments. In Fig.5, POPLGR is positive opinion leader group rank proposed in this paper, DC is Degree Centrality [10], DP is Degree Prestige [10] and ACSC is accumulated scores. A standard POLG considering activity, influence range and ACSC is selected. From Fig.5, our method has better precision, recall and F-score. In this paper, we focus on obtaining explicit, implicit links and sentiment orientation of comments. According to the links, we model multi-themes user network and detect positive opinion leader group effectively. 
Although this paper proposed some useful methods for detecting OPLDG , there are some limitations. The phrase structure sometimes can X  X  be extracted exactly. A convictive OPLDG for comparison has no standard. So they will be our future work.
