The emergence of the Internet and the World Wide Web is, perhaps, the most important development of the 20th century, having fundamentally altered the way we seek, exchange, distribute, and process informa-tion. The Internet and the World Wide Web are, by their very nature, very large distributed, decentralized, self-organized and evolving systems, which yield uncertain and incomplete measurements and data. Prob-ability and statistics are the mathematical tools that allow us to model, reason and proceed with inference in such uncertain environments (Baldi, Frasconi, &amp; Smith, 2003).

Modeling the Internet and the Web: Probabilistic Methods and Algorithms has eight chapters in all. The first two chapters introduce the reader to mathematical concepts used in the remaining part of the book, and basic Web technologies. In the remaining six chapters, the authors explore various concepts such as
Web-graphs, link analysis, text analysis, crawling techniques, modeling human behavior on the Web, com-merce on the Web and so on. The book chapters cover some of the most important and recent develop-ments in their respective areas. They also successfully relate theoretical concepts with their applications in the Web and Internet domains. In addition to explaining, in detail, some core theoretical concepts, the authors have also made references to several empirical studies. The authors have also pointed out similarities between the characteristics of the Internet and other kinds of networks such as social networks, business networks, and so on which might be useful to their non-computer-scientist/information-scientist readers. At the end of each chapter, the book provides some exercise problems.
 Based on probabilistic modeling, graph theory and so on, Modeling the Internet and the Web: Probabilistic
Methods and Algorithms requires some mathematical background. The authors try to provide an introduc-tion to these concepts in the first chapter. The underlying mathematical concepts have been explained with reasonable simplicity and comprehensiveness. Although not for complete  X  X  X on-experts X  X , most of the mathe-matical concepts can still be grasped by those with basic knowledge in probability, basic calculus, matrix algebra, and so on. The authors have provided some very good examples to explain these mathematical con-cepts and their applications in the domains of the Internet and the Web. The transition from probability and statistics to their Web-based and Internet-based applications is very quick and smooth, which draws the readers  X  attention and understanding towards the application and not the underlying math.

The second chapter of the book provides an introductory chapter to introduce basic Web-technologies of today, which might be particularly useful for those actually implementing some of the ideas provided by the book. However, the book does not mention XML, a very popular Web technology, which is surprising.
Within each chapter, the authors have covered a wide range of sub-topics. For example, in the chapter on text analysis, the authors discuss indexing, compression, lexical analysis, document similarity, text categorization, information extraction, machine learning, clustering, feature selection, ranking and so on which cover almost all the major areas of interest in Text Analysis. The authors have either explained, in detail, some of the most important or popular ideas in these areas, or provided pointers to important work, making the book an almost definitive collection of the work in these areas.

Modeling the Internet and the Web claims to cater to the interests of a very wide and diverse audience. It is undoubtedly an excellent book for computer scientists, information scientists, and other researchers working in the areas of information retrieval, information search, semantic processing and so on. However, in the first six chapters, although the authors try to inter-relate concepts to domains such as psychology and sociology, the book is clearly biased towards the interests of computer scientists and information scientists, rather than those of economists, sociologists, and others who the authors state are also their target audi-ence. However, the two chapters on  X  Modeling human behavior on the Web  X  , and  X  Commerce on the Web  X  might be of interest to economists, sociologists, psychologists, business analysts, and others.
Overall, Modeling the Internet and the Web is an authority on probabilistic methods and algorithms for modeling the Internet and the Web, covering some of the key topics in these areas, and doing a wide survey of the work in each topic. The first two chapters provide a strong foundation for the fundamentals required to understand the book. The book provides abundant references to good works in the area. The reader might have to refer to the pointed works to get a better understanding, since the book does not always pro-vide a very detailed and concrete explanation of the concepts involved. The authors have done a marvelous job of tying mathematical concepts with Web-based and Internet-related domains, which gives the reader a clear insight into their applications in these domains.

On the whole, Modeling the Internet and the Web is certainly a good read. True to its word, it can serve the interests of researchers, students and practitioners from academia, industry and government alike as it strikes a good balance between theory, examples, exercises and applications.
 Reference Tracing Genres through Organizations: A Sociocultural Approach to Information Design. By Clay Spinuzzi. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2003. xi + 246 pp., ISBN: 0-262-19491-0, $35
Despite the tremendous growth in technical communications courses and programs over the past two decades (Johnson-Eilola &amp; Selber, 2001), the role and status of technical communication has become a much-debated topic in the field  X  s literature (c.f., Kynell-Hunt &amp; Savage, 2003; Mirel &amp; Spilka, 2002). Such introspection has been brought on by the disconcerting suspicion that despite technical communicators  X  best intentions, many people do not use manuals, help utilities, or on-line tutorials to learn their new tech-nologies. Technological problem solving usually entails muddling through, learning from trial and error, or obtaining help from a colleague (or one  X  s children). Clay Spinuzzi  X  s Tracing genres through organizations is a detailed, empirical, and important contribution to addressing these issues. The book challenges many of the bedrock assumptions of recent technical communication theory. At the same time, the book argues that despite two decades of emphasizing the context and process of writing, technical communication research has yet to produce a successful theory to describe accurately how people learn to use their workplace tech-nologies and how these technologies adapt to different situations and conditions.

Tracing genres creates a decidedly post-humanistic orientation for technical communicators. Spinuzzi writes that though technical communicators have created for themselves a  X  X  X audable [humanist] goal X  X  (p. 8) their job should not be to save users from  X  X  X elfish, short sighted employers, an antidemocratic cap-italist system, managers who do not understand or are opposed to the needs of workers, a flawed work
