 dimensions due to the complexity. Kamata, Richard and Yukihiro presented a repre-N-dimensional Hilbert mappings efficiently. X through 2 m it can be expressed by using H N m . Fig. 1 shows H 2 1 , H 2 2 and H 2 3 . Definition 1. (N-dimensional Hilbert cell: C N ) H ) . is an example of C 3 . Definition 2. (N-dimensional Hilbert gene) Table 1 is an example of a 3-D Hilbert gene list. We describe a gene list by using G[i] . C through reverse (X 2 '). Algorithms include generating Hilbert cell and generate the Hilbert gene. 3.1 Generating N-Dimensional Hilbert Cell The algorithm can be described as follows: C [4]=110, C 3 [5]=111, C 3 [6]=101, C 3 [7]=100. 3.2 Generating N-Dimensional Hilbert Gene H 1 [i]. Confirming the Entry and Exit of H N 1 [i] X as follows: 
Confirm_Entry_Exit(input i) { } (0&amp;1=0; 0&amp;0=0; 1&amp;1=1). The entry and exit of H 3 1 [i] can be described as follows: Generating Gene List of an N-Dimensional Hilbert Curve express reverse transformation by using G[i][1]. The algorithm can be described as follows: 
Confirm_GeneList(input i) { } The 3-D Hilbert gene list can be expressed as follows: G[0][0]=101, G[0][1]=000; G[1][0]=110, G[1][1]=000; G[2][0]=000, G[2][1]=000; G[3][0]=101, G[3][1]=101; G[4][0]=101, G[4][1]=000; G[5][0]=000, G[5][1]=000; G[6][0]=110, G[6][1]=110; G[7][0]=101, G[7][1]=101. Hilbert curve as an example to describe the course of growing of a Hilbert curve: X
 X  X  X 3 ; Generating H 3 above steps, we can generate H 3 3 . efficient Hilbert mappings.
