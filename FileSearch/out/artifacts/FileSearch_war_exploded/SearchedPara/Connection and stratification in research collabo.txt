In the function (3) , independent variable is k , p ( ak ) a and hence we call it as scale-free network ( Newman, 2003 ).

 Let CL i be the closeness of node i , d ij has the same meaning as in function (1) zero ( Borgatti, Everett, &amp; Freeman, 2002 ). 2.2.3. Betweenness centrality is that of Freeman (1977, 1979) , which also be referred to as geodesic betweenness. Let B of node i ; g jik be the all geodesics linking node j and node k which pass through node i ; g linking node j and node k .The betweenness of node i is as follows ( Borgatti et al., 2002 ): removed. So, we can see high betweenness nodes are crucial for the formation of small-world effect. 2.2.4. K-core There exists an efficient algorithm for determining the cores in software Netdraw ( Borgatti, 2002 ). We denote the neighborhood of node v 2 V by N ( v ): And the rooted neighborhood of node v 2 V by N + ( v ): 3. The structure of the COLLNET network sible data about the cooperation of COLLNET members which are the basic data of our present work. There are 223 bibliographic multi-authored publications (including books, articles in peer reviewed journals,
COLLNET members X  collaboration relationship. More details of the COLLNET can get in the Webpage: www.collnet.de . For the 64 members of COLLNET, until 2003, there still are 16 members who have cooper-ated with nobody else in COLLNET. In our study, because we pay more attention to the structure of the cooperation network and knowledge flowing through this network, they are excluded from our analysis. So, in our database, there are 48 members who at least cooperate with one COLLNET member.
Fig. 1 is the cooperation graph of the COLLNET members. There are total 48 nodes and 63 links in the network. By removing six smaller isolate components from the graph G we get the truncated COLLNET important role in the network, while others are peripheral. But what extend do they affect the network, in this paper. 3.1. Macro-structure: connection 3.1.1.

For the COLLNET network as a whole, the clustering coefficient is the average of all individual C cooperation networks (Medline: 0.066; Los Alamos e-Print Archive: 0.380; SPIRES: 0.726; NCSTRL: 0.496) ( Newman, 2001a, 2001b, 2001c ).

MaxDeg is the maximum degree of nodes in a network. The value of C network, other indicator should be included, such as weight of cooperation. 3.1.3. Average degree and degree distribution
The average degree of the nodes in a network can reflect the compact-ness of the network. The higher the average degree, the tighter the network. The average degree of nodes in our network is 2.625, which means that the cooperation between COLLNET members is sparse. This is the same as Kretschmer X  X  result publications. The average number of collaborators of COLLNET members is lower than that of the purely easy to understand; the subject matter of COLLNET is rather narrow, and the network is very young (founded in 2000).

The range and variability of degree can be quite important, because it describes whether the population 2004 ).

The presence of an exponential degree distribution suggests that the individual scholars in the network to be parts of new collaborations than those who have not previously collaborated. To the degree that actors. 3.1.4. Robustness of the network
Some networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, various attack strategies ( Eubank et al., 2004; Liljeros, Edling, Stanley, A  X  X  X obust X  X  in the face of the loss of central  X  X  X ubs X  X  or leading figures.

The loss of three  X  X  X ubs X  X  in the COLLNET network results in considerable fragmentation; this suggests that the community is somewhat fragile, and dependent on central figures to maintain connection across of collaboration. Fig. 4 shows the structure that remains after random deletion half of all actors.

Using measures of centrality, we are able to identify actors in the COLLNET network who occupy more  X  X  X nfluential X  X  positions. Table 1 shows these results. 3.2.1. Degree centrality

As we have seen, some actors are more central in COLLNET than others. We have also seen that the actors relaxed.

Although COLLNET is not a large-scale network, the results are useful to pro-most important hub nodes and who have the most influence in the network.

Another thing we want to point out is that in COLLNET network few nodes always locate at the top of promote diversity, communication, and integration of the community.
