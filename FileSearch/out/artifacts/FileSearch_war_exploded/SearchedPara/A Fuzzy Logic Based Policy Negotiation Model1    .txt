 A policy is a statement of intent or a principle of action to guide decisions and achieve certain goals, and policy generation is a process of aggregating different stockholders X  opinions or preferences to reach a set of policies acceptable to them all, which is very important in in political science, management science and economics [2]. However, most of the studies of policy generation have two limitations [2]: (i) For example, voting [4] (the most common used method for policy generation) cannot reflect that in real life sometimes policy generation is an interactive process among a group of people, for they need flexibly change their opinions in the light of more information revealed during policy generation. (ii) There are few effective methods for evaluating a set of policies when there are many alternative choices of policy set in fuzzy environments [18]. for policy generation, for example, negotiation models. In fact, negotiation is suitable for policy generation because it is a process in which a group of parties exchange infor-mation to obtain a mutually acceptable outcomes [3, 10, 11]. Thus, for instance, Zhang [19] develops a logic-based axiomatic model of bargaining to handle conflicting de-mands ( e.g. , policy). However, the model cannot handle the dynamic situation where players need to make some changes during the bargaining process. However, in real life policies often have to be generated in a dynamic environment. For example, the Six-Party Talk on North Korea X  X  Nuclear Program [19], different countries should dy-namically change their proposals to result in a better outcome. Thus, Zhan et al. [18] propose a negotiation model in which agents can change their preferences over demands ( e.g. , policy) during a bargaining to increase the chance of reaching an agreement. the second problem of lacking methods for evaluating a set of policies. This is mainly because such models are all ordinal models, where the utilities of policies are not mea-sured by numerical values, but modelled by qualitative preference orderings over poli-cies. However, when there are too many policies, it is hard to evaluate the combinations of different values of different policies. Actually, it is easy to use the ordinal model to depict the preference over policies intuitively, but it is hard to evaluate a set of policies due to the lack of quantitative assessments. So, an agreement in an ordinal model often has to be accord with some certain axioms [19], but its final result is not always optimal. Hence, a proposal evaluation method is required for negotiation-based policy genera-tion models in order to research a set of policies agreeable to all the agents involved. (i) to evaluate each policy in a proposal during negotiation; (ii) to aggregate the evalu-ations of all the policies in the proposal to gain an overall evaluation on the proposal. For the first step, we suppose that each agent knows the importance degrees of their policies and the concession of their policies in a proposal compared with their original attitude toward to the policies. Then each negotiating agents employs a fuzzy logic sys-tem to calculate the utility of each policy in a proposal. The fuzzy rules of each agent is based on its user X  X  intuition, and different negotiating agents could have have different fuzzy rules. For the second step, each agent uses a uninorm operator [15] to generate the utility of a proposal of a policy set.
 policy generation models in the following aspects. (i) We design an agent architecture for a group of self-interested agents to negotiate a set of policies. (ii) With respect to the agent model, we propose a fuzzy logic based method to calculate agents X  utilities, which negotiating agents use to evaluate their proposals of policies. (iii) Different negotiating agents can use different sets of fuzzy rules, different linguistic terms associated with fuzzy rules, and different membership functions even for the same linguistic terms. operator and fuzzy logic. Section 3 describes our negotiation-based model. Section 4 discusses our fuzzy logic method for evaluating a set of policies. Section 5 conducts some experiments to reveal some insights into our model. Section 6 discusses the related work. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper with future work. This section recaps the concepts of uninorm operator [15] and fuzzy logic [16]. Definition 1. A binary operator  X  : r 0 , 1 s X r 0 , 1 s  X  r 0 , 1 s is a uninorm operator that satisfies increasing, associative and commutative, and there exists  X  Pr 0 , 1 s such that: Here  X  is said to be the unit element of a uninorm.
 where  X  Pp 0 , 1 q is with unit element  X  .
 Lemma 1. A uninorm operator  X  with unit element  X  has the following properties : (i) @ a 1 , a 2 Pp  X  , 1 s , a 1  X  a 2  X  max t a 1 , a 2 u ; (ii) @ a 1 , a 2 Pr 0 ,  X  q , a 1  X  a 2  X  min t a 1 , a 2 u ; and (iii) @ a 1 Pr 0 ,  X  q , a 2 Pp  X  , 1 s , min t a 1 , a 2 u X  a 1  X  a 2  X  max t a 1 , a 2 u . an agent is satisfied with a policy in a proposal or not. If an evaluation is greater than the threshold, then the evaluation is regarded as being positive; otherwise, it is regarded as being negative. Thus, in Lemma 1, property (i) means that when the evaluations are both positive, the aggregated one is not less than either of the original evaluations; property (ii) means that when they are both negative, the aggregated one will enhance the negative effect, and is not greater than either of the original evaluations; and property (iii) means that when they are in conflict, the aggregated one is a compromise. Since the unit element of a uninorm operator is actually a threshold, it could vary from person to person to represent different personalities of players.
 Definition 2. Let U be a set (called domain). A fuzzy set A on U is characterised by its membership function and @ u P U ,  X  A p u q is called the membership degree of u in fuzzy set A.
 fuzzy rule A i  X  B i is fuzzy set B 1 i defined as follows: and  X  not  X  in A i by  X  min  X ,  X  max  X  and  X 1  X   X   X , respectively. And the output of all rules A 1  X  B 1 ,  X   X   X  , A n  X  B n , is fuzzy set M , which is defined as: crisp one, which is called defuzzification. We will employ the following well-known centroid method [12] for defuzzification in this paper: Definition 4. The centroid point u cen of fuzzy set M given by formula (4) is: This section will define the main components of our policy negotiation model. Policies can be represented by propositions. For example, disarmament is a policy and joining a military alliance is another policy. We describe a policy through two dimen-sions: one is about an agent X  X  attitude to the policy (support or reject), and the other is about how important it is to the agent. Formally, we have: Definition 5. For agent i, its policy structure S is a tuple of p X i , Att i , Im p i q , where:  X  X i is a finite set of propositions in a propositional language L and @ x P X i , x is a  X  Im p i : X i  X p 0 , 1 s is an importance function, i.e. , @ x P X i , Im p p x q is the importance support or oppose the policy), and does not have an attitude to any irrelevant policy since those policies do not affect his utility of an agreement. For example, if agent i supports the policy of disarmament , then his attitude to this issue is Att i p disarmament q  X  1. In fact, opposing a policy can also be represented by a proposition [19, 8, 18], such as oppose disarmament , but we differentiate attitudes and policies in this paper because we aim to deal with both policies in continuous domains and discrete domains. In discrete domains, the policy, such as joining a military alliance , should be completely accepted or completely rejected by an agent. In the final agreement of policies, such a policy is either supported or opposed. Nevertheless, in continuous domains, a policy can be partially accepted in a final agreement, i.e. , the acceptance domain is divisible. If the policy is disarmament , then supporting such a policy may mean to reduce ten-thousand soldiers and opposing it may mean to totally maintain the existing size of the army. Thus, in the agreement, disarmament can be partly accepted and opposed. A successful negotiation can lead to an acceptable level, such as reducing five thousand soldiers. one of the agents gives a proposal to the others. Formally, we have: Definition 6. An proposal function of agent i is a mapping O i : X i  X  X  X  i  X r 0 , 1 s , where X  X  i denotes the policy set of all i X  X  opponents. And @ x P X i  X  X  X  i , O i p x q is called agent i X  X  acceptance degree of policy x. And o i  X  X  O i p x 1 q ,..., O i p x n qu is called a proposal of agent i, where n is the number of elements in X i  X  X  X  i .
 posal evaluation. Firstly, a negotiating agent uses a fuzzy reasoning system to evaluate a policy in a proposal. Clearly, if all of its acceptance degrees of policies in a proposal are the same as its attitudes to the policies, then its utility is the highest because it has no concession on any policy. On the contrary, when its opponent X  X  policy proposal is completely against its attitudes, its utility is the lowest. Intuitively, the more conces-sions an agent makes on a policy, the less utility it gains from the policy; and the more important the policy is for the agent, the more the utility decreases. Formally, we have: Definition 7. For agent i, a local utility of policy x in proposal o is given by: where x P X i , F R is the result of fuzzy reasoning based on a set of fuzzy rules (we will detail it in the next section); Con i is a concession degree function, representing a degree to which agent i makes a concession on a policy, and defined as where Att i p x q and O i p x q are agent i X  X  attitidute and acceptance degree to policy x, re-spectively.
 we should find a way to aggregate all the local utilities into a global utility to reflect the utility an agent can gain from a proposal. Here we apply the uninorm operator [15] to solve this problem, because the operator has the properties shown in Lemma 1 that satisfy the intuition of local utility aggregation. Formally we have: Definition 8. For agent i, a global utility of proposal o, denoted as u i p o q , is given by: where k is the number of elements in X i .
 consideration in this model because the same proposal in different rounds has different utilities for an agent. Intuitively, the utility an agent gains from a proposal is lower than the same one in a previous round, and the utility becomes less and less as time goes on. Formally, we have: Definition 9. A global utility of proposal o with time constrains for agent i is given by: where u i is the global utility of agent i,  X  P r 0 , 1 s is discount factor for decreasing the utility of the proposals as time passes, and  X  refers to the  X  -th round of the negotiation. it or not, thus it should have an acceptable threshold of utility in every round. That is, if one of the opponents X  proposal results in a low utility for an agent, which is lower than its acceptable threshold in that round, the agent should reject it, and vice versa. If the agent rejects a proposal, it should generate another policy proposal, which utility is not lower than the threshold. The acceptable threshold of utility changes in every round because an agent has different expectations for the results in every round. For example, in real life it often happens that in the beginning of a negotiation, an agent expects the agreement that is the best to it, but as the time goes, it becomes increasingly willing to accept an suboptimal result in order to avoid breakdown of the negotiation. In this paper, we use  X  u i p  X  q to represent the acceptable threshold of agent i in the  X  th round. of policy generation. More specifically, one of the agents initialises the negotiation ran-domly and the others respond to it. The first proposal of every agent should indicate its attitude to the policies it concerns. Formally, the first proposal of agent i , denoted as O the agent should reveal its attitude at the beginning, because this kind of proposal can maximise its utility. That is, there is absolutely no concession on any policy. Of course, it is the best proposal which the negotiating agent wants in the agreement. Other agent can choose: (i) to accept the proposal, (ii) to reject the proposal but make a new one, or (iii) to end the negotiation that results in the lowest utilities for all agents. If every negotiating agent has proposed a proposal in turn, then a negotiation round is completed and if there is no proposal supported by all negotiating agents, they will enter into a new round of negotiation. Some policies proposed by agent i may be irrelevant to agent j and different outcomes of this kind of policies do not influence j  X  X  utility. We call such policies as irrelevant to party j , but an agreement should also include such policies. agents in negotiation is supported by all the other agents. Formally, we have: Definition 10. A proposal o proposed in the  X  -th round in an n-agent negotiation is an agreement among the n agents if it satisfies: @ i Pt 1 , 2 ,..., n u , where u t i p o q is the global utility of proposal o with time constrains for agent i and  X  u i p  X  q is the acceptable threshold in  X  th round for agent i. This section discusses fuzzy rules that are used to evaluate local utilities of each policy in a policy proposal of an agent.
 and the concession degree. Here we use five terms ( i.e., very unimportant , unimportant , medium , important and very unimportant ) to depict different levels of importance of a policy. Similarly, we use four terms ( i.e., very high , high , low and very low ) to represent different levels of concession an agent makes on a policy and seven terms i.e., very high , high , slightly high , medium , slight low , low and very low ) to indicate different levels of the output of fuzzy reasoning ( i.e. , the local utility of a policy for an agent). Thus, we can draw the membership functions of these linguistic terms of importance degree, concession degree and local utility as shown in Figs. 1 X 3. Moreover, if neces-sary, different users can take different kinds of membership functions to represent their linguistic terms of importance degree, concession degree and local utility according to their cognition. That is, even for the same linguistic term, for example,  X  X mportant X , if necessary, different users can have different kinds of membership functions.
 their membership functions, different human users can set different sets of fuzzy rules to calculate the local utility of a proposal. Here in order to illustrate how the fuzzy rules work, we give an example of fuzzy rules as displayed in Table 1. There Rule 1 means that if the importance degree of a policy is very unimportant and its concession degree is not very high , then its local utility is very high . Such a rule reflects the intuition that if a person does not make a very high concession on a very unimportant policy, then his local utility of the policy is very high. Similarly, we can understand other rules. Notice that these rules and the linguistic terms of inputs and output may vary from person to person. Those in this paper are just one of many possibilities. This section will do an experiment to reveal some insight into our model.
 disarmament (DA) , increase of educational investment (IEI) , and economical housings investment (EHI) . These policies are in continuous domains, i.e. , the parties can give a proposal reflecting they can partially support or oppose some policies; the acceptance degree can take a value from t 0 , 0 . 2 , 0 . 4 ,  X   X   X  , 1 u . The policy structures of both agents are shown in Table 2. That is, Party 1 supports T I and IEI , opposes EHI , and does not care about DA (we call it irrelevant policy of Party 1 because it does not affect its global utility); while Party 2 supports DA , opposes T I and IEI , and EHI is irrelevant to it. of Parties 1 and 2, and have different kinds of linguistic terms of importance degree, concession degree and local utility. More specifically, what Agent 1 has are as shown in Figures 1-3, respectively, and it adopts fuzzy rules shown in Table 1; while Agent 2 has different ones as shown in Figures 4-6, and Agent 2 X  X  fuzzy rules are shown in Table 3. the opponent rejects this proposal and the agent also rejects its opponent X  X  counter-proposal, the agent gives another proposal with second highest global utility in a new round. In order to calculate the global utility of a proposal for an agent, we should firstly calculate the local utility of each relevant policy in a proposal for an agent. domly in r 0 , 1 s and see how different combinations of discount factors change: (i) the global utilities with time constraint of Agent 1 (see Fig. 7) and Agent 2 (see Fig. 8), (ii) the sum of utility with time constraint of the two Agents (see Fig. 9), and (iii) the number of negotiation round for reaching an agreement (see Fig. 10).
 discount factor of Agent 2 is very low, the global utility with time constraint of Agent 1 is very high, meaning that if Agent 1 does not need to pay too much time cost during the course of the negotiation or Agent 2 has to pay high time cost when negotiating with its opponent, Agent 1 has advantages for reaching an agreement that generates more utility for itself. On the contrary, Fig. 8 shows that if the discount factor of Agent 1 is low or the discount factor of Agent 2 is high, the Agent 2 will have advantages for reaching an agreement that generates more utility for itself. In Fig. 9, the sum of utility with time constraint of Agents 1 and 2 without obvious monotonicity. The maximum ( i.e. , 1.8518) appears when  X  1  X   X  2  X  1 because no matter how many rounds for reaching an agreement is needed, there is no time cost in such situation; while the minimum ( i.e. , 0.5821) appears when  X  1  X  0 . 8 and  X  2  X  0 . 5, because both the discount factors and the negotiation round are not low. Why the sum of utility with time constraint of Agents 1and 2 is high when the discount factors are very low? This is because the negotiations ends with an agreement in the first round, then there is no time cost. Fig. 10 shows that the number of negotiation round for reaching an agreement increases with the discount factors of Agents 1 and 2. This section discusses the work related to our negotiation model.
 Zhang et al. [20] proposed a logic-based axiomatic model for political bargaining and other similar ones. There bargainers X  demands (could be policies) are represented by logical statements and bargainers X  preferences are total pre-orders. Zhang [19] later proved their concept of solution is uniquely characterised by five logical axioms. Fur-ther, Jing et al. [8] extend Zhang X  X  work by adding integrity constraints into Zhang X  X  model, i.e. , the demand preference structure of each negotiating agent is restricted by integrity constraints. However, in all the above models, the agents cannot change their offers during bargaining process. Thus, Zhan et al. [18] proposed a multi-demand bar-gaining model based on fuzzy rules, which can use fuzzy reasoning to calculate how much bargainers should change their preferences during bargaining according to their personalities. However, differently in this paper we use fuzzy reasoning to calculate the utility of a policy. Compared with their method, ours is more flexible because our agent can adjust its offers during negotiation without a mediator. Gonz  X  alez et al. [6] based compensatory fuzzy logic to establish a negotiation model, which is also used to solve policy making problem. However, they study the problem from the view of coopera-tive game theory, different from our non-cooperative one. Moreover, unlike them, we focus on how to use fuzzy logic to reflect the relation between a policy X  X  concession, importance and utility.
 gotiation. For example, Kolomvatsos et al. [9] propose an adaptive fuzzy logic system to help buyer agents to respond to sellers X  offers, i.e. , the fuzzy logic system is used as a part of negotiation strategies. Similarly, Haberland et al. [7] also use fuzzy logic system to adjust agent X  X  negotiation strategy. Zhan et al. [17] use type-2 fuzzy logic to determine the change of strategies according to the remaining time and opponents cooperative degree. Adabi et al. [1] design a fuzzy grid market pressure determination system based negotiation protocol, which is enhanced by a fuzzy logic system in order to increase negotiators X  utilities and their negotiation success rate and speed. Fu et al. [5] use fuzzy logic to make an offer, i.e. , to determine a price that balances the good customer relationship and profits for companies. Shojaiemehr and Rafsanjani [14] use fuzzy logic to match the right supplier to a buyers by modifying suppliers X  offers auto-matically during negotiation. However, none of these models use fuzzy logic to evaluate offers during the course of a negotiation. Rather, we use fuzzy logic to help agents to evaluate local utility of a proposal for one issue, and we finally use a uniform operator to aggregate the local utility of individual issues to a global utility for the whole offer. This paper propose a negotiation model for policy generation. The evaluation method in the model can reason how concessions and preferences of policies affect an agent X  X  util-ity of a policy. Actually, a negotiating agent use a fuzzy reasoning system to calculate local utility of a proposal for an agent according to intuitive fuzzy rules (and differ-ent agents could have different fuzzy reasoning systems). Then a uninorm operator is used to aggregate all the local utilities into a global utility that an agent can gain if the proposal is accepted. With respect to an example, we did experiments to reveal some insights into our model. In particular, the experimental results show that the discount factor can influence the global utility with time constraint of negotiating agents, and the negotiation rounds for reaching an agreement. In the future, maybe the most interesting thing is to improve its negotiation protocol to reflect partnership among negotiators, because in policy generation, negotiators may form alliances to raise their interests.
