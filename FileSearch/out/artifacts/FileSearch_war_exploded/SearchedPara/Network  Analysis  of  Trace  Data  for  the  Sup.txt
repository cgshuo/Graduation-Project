An increasingly common form of analysis traces of online interaction than was available to sociologists who first sought insight through struct ural analysis. However, SNA not consistently applied in onlin e settings[11]. Finding the type of data that most accurately represen ts online interactions is needed. To date, the dominant form of on line social network analysis data (also known as  X  X assive X  activity) hasnot been generally recognized as a vital component in online social network analysis, the act of observing others as a pa rt of learning and interacting is widely acknowledged as integral and important [15].

In the CSCL literature, the shift from taking a snapshot of present group state toward understanding how online groups change over time is addressed from two methodol ogical perspectives. First, by hierarchical linear modeling (HLM).De Laat et al applied SNA to utility of SNA methods for CSCL log analysis.Cress noted in her study of the utility of HLM for studying collaborative groups that collaborative groups, larger diffe rences (or variance) can be found in the different time periods or themes in which the groups influenced by activity and task, and multiple snapshots should be structure. over time.One way to accomplish this is by understanding how successful interactions, instructor s and members require a view of how they are working togetherand how different SNA structures and measures relate to group performance and cohesion over time.Little research is presently focused on completely online CSCL groups, online small-group st ructures or online, small-group activity patterns.In addition, no prior research has examined group structures and contrasted those structures across activity types in a completely online context. These gaps in the research lead us to several questions. We would expect the structure of online groups to vary by activity type, but does activity type play in this variance?And is there a relationship by participants?Working to answer these questions will illuminate the nature of completely onlin e small group collaboration, the social network patterns that emerge from different activity types. For most previous social networ king research in environments outside CSCL, SNA has been used to analyze interactions through understanding of how context is constructed through member numerous points in time during co llaboration would shed light on the nature of group de velopment and context. To better understand online CSCL groups, Katz et al X  X  idea of time series network analysis needs to be applied. Looking at small activity typeswould be a step fo rward inunderstanding completely online group development.Analysis of fine-grained bi-directional log data, combined with qualitative analysis of member generated discussion and content can provide a rich understanding of online group developmentacross different activity types. All the studies mentioned in the following review use social network analysis to understand on line interaction patterns. In addition to summarizing the contributions they make to framing our study, we highlight three impor tant aspects: 1) the use of uni- X  X napshots X  used to see changes in group structure over time, and 3) the unit of analysis (communities versus groups). Aviv, Erlich&amp;Ravid[2] useduni-dir ectional log data from a single communities.They performed social network analysis of two CSCL communities by looking at the cohesion and roles within those communities.They found that knowledge construction by course members was higher in st ructured online groups than it was in unstructured online groups.They also found evidence of networks produced more knowledge.However, the highly generalizations to naturalistic environments.Computer mediation dispersed, completely online lived experience.Due to the single-point-in-time and community-ori ented nature of the study, changes in the structure within communities over time were not reported.Haythornthwaite[10]highli ghted the potential of viewing acknowledged the confounding eff ects of team structure.These groups in completely online CSCLsettings. De Laat et al [14] established the utility of SNA in CSCL studies as a means for triangulating the findings derived from other showed that instructor position in online social networks was visible through SNA, and that very active and nominally active members of the course were easi ly distinguished.De Laat et al study interactions within groups in a networked learning community.They captured posts and responses in a Web-CT-hosted, masters-of-educ ation learning community and integrated incident interview data.Their st udy used member post data to measured the centrality and densit y of the social network.Post data described active response by members to each other, but did others.This uni-directional nature of the logs used by de Laat et al [14]provided a narrow view of one type of interaction, and the log record was not contextualized to specific topics, discussion boards or posts in the way the data are in the current study.For example, network analysis of uni-directional logs waslimited because a participant who posts 70 items and reads 3 items shows the same level of social connectedness as a participant who makes 70 posts but reads 350 posts.The activity that is invisible in uni-directional logging is key to our understanding of how the structures of CSCL groups unfold. Shen et al [19] used bi-directional logs of read and post activity at community in an online learning environment.They compared two [19] showed that the developmen t of a sense of community in community corresponded with differences in social network capturing(1) the network at different points in time, (2) the identity of the original discussion board creator. Analysis of how groups of people relate to each other and structural analysis in the social sciences.Structural analysis makes ofsociograms. Wasserman &amp; Faus t[25] and Koku&amp; Wellman [13] describe social network analys ismethods for understanding these structures.The core concepts represented by any SNA method are the actor (who can be an individual, group or event), the relational groups, subgroups and networks.E ach SNA method or statistic views these components and their relations from a particular perspective. There are commonly established social network measuresused to make structural patterns visibl e. Five common SNA statistics are:1) Socio-centric density, 2) Freeman betweenness centrality, 3) Network centralization, 4) Core -periphery analysis and 5) SNA cliques. because they are focused on members.Density calculations consider two types of network:va lue networks and dichotomized networks.In value networks tie strength is measured, while in indication.For both network types, density is highest in a network where everyone talks with everyone else, and lowest when there is betweenness centrality (or simply,  X  X etweenness X ) is a measure of the importance of a node to ma king connections between other nodes.High betweenness for a member indicates that they are a  X  X onnection point X  for ideas between two clusters within the family who plays rugby and goes to church, you have a high betweenness in a network composed of a church and rugby team. Network centralization, core-periphery and clique statistics thegroupings and relationships between groupings, sometimes called the macro view of SNA [3,4,6,18].Network centralization measures indicate how tightly th e social network is organized around its most central point.Highl y centralized networks have include every single event that occurs between members.High in-degree centralization indicates th at group members are reading the most of the posts.Core-periphery measures showthat there is some network with one center [25].Core members are distinguished by influential. A small number of studies have enriched incomplete, uni-depictions of completely online learning. Reffay&amp;Chanier [17] experimental groups in a 10 week, online language course. They demonstrated the use of integrated core/periphery clusters and cliques by using core/periphery analysis to determine the optimum n for performing n-Clique analysis on a social network in an interviews from one point in time to look at betweenness in virtual studies underscore the recognized importance of the analysis presented here, along with the diffic ulty past researchers have had of completely online groups. the previous network measures th at incorporate member positions in a network along with measures of the network itself will make different activity types visible. proceeded through these individual, peer-to-peer, and small group activities.In this study we pursue these three research questions :1) How do the social interactions among completely online group members vary by activity type?2) How and to what extent do the have a visible representation in the sociograms?and 3) How do bi-contribute to the understanding of the social interactions and activity types seen in the analyses? This study was conducted at a larg e US university using an online learning environment composed of an open-source course management tool called Sakai and an open-source activity Notification System), which logs bi-directional data.

Course artifacts and interview transcripts Social network analysis was used to address our first research question, which is how and to wh at extent interactions and group structure vary by activity type.Our interaction analysis was guided constructed fromCANS data.Indivi dual actions (reads, posts and responses), which occur mostly (92% of events) in the discussion board,are the core data that define network structure in our five posts are viewable on a page.

Figure 1 -Bidirectional Netw ork Data: Reads and Posts reference classic studies from the social networking literature and laboratory-based eye-tracking studi es as a basis for recording discussion post simply because it was on a page they viewed presence at a party constituted a tie[7]. Second, eye-tracking studies suggest that users exhibit broad, top-to-bottomscanpaths studies will strengthen the theoretical foundation for recording log based, bi-directional network ties. Our social network analysis followe d strategies described by Scott [18], Wasserman &amp; Faust [25] and Carrington et al [4]. We first development for different activity types within a group of 16, macro and micro social network analysis measures were pursued [6,18].UCINetwas used to perform the calculations, and netdraw implementation of network mathem atical and graph theoretical constructs [3,6,18]. build a more complete understanding of the network we incorporated the additional m easures of betweenness, core-periphery analysis and clique fo rmation, following the work of Reffay and Chanier[17]. Cleardistinctions among group members and activity types were first exposed through sociograms. Over 80% of discussion board betweenness centrality. In our study, betweenness centrality is more meaningful than in prior studies examining online social networks because both reading and posting behavior between individuals was present in our da ta. After sociogramswere created, analyses and a description of the relationship between social experience, which we discu ss in the next section. question, which examineshow and to what extent participant experiences in each of the activity types is expressed in the sociograms.Discussion boards, inte rview transcripts, and other activity types, we performed two types of analysis. different activity types. Two rate rs categorized communication as  X  X ntergroup X .Interpersonal communication occurs between two people.Interindividual communica tion also occurs between negotiation.Intragroup communication is communication that occurs within a discernable group.Intergroup communication occurs between discernible groups. Second, we applied methods from the tradition of grounded theory, beginning with open coding [23] to uncover themes and patterns from the data.A second pass at the open codes was done to look for data that helped to explain social phenomena that unfolded during each of the three activity types. The three sets of participant interviews and daily researcher observation were used to triangula te findings from social network analysis and discussion board coding.We obser ved discussion once each day during the entire 16 weeks of the class.Field notes were maintained in nVivoand later analyzed alongside our other data. For the final step in our process, a case study analysis method [22] was used.This addressed the uni que challenges associated with studies describe how participants experience online group transcripts, field notes, course deliverables, course discussion boards and activity logs were coded as described above using themes and patterns. The combined use of qualitative analysis methods and social network analysis is intended to br ing semantic richness to network completely online collaborative activities.The comprehensiveness triangulation and manual coding of ar tifacts helped us to construct a uniquely rich view of completely online group work. We learned that group structure vari ed in a clear way with activity type in this completely online course.The results are presented in two mainparts, corresponding with our research questions.First, group.Second, we integrate our qualitative analysis of group directional activity logs and draw comparisons.The answer to our third research question, comparing bi-directional logs to uni-and summarized at the end of the results section. The density information we presen t contrasts the same people and context across three time periods, each reflecting a different network is considerably denser fo r individually oriented activities Table 3, individual activities have higher network density (8.43 to 3.67 or 3.28) than activities w ith a priori groupings.Network density is roughly the same for both small group and peer-to-peer activities.When we pred etermine a network by defining groups of who to interact with, a subs tantial portion of the population interacts only with those people. Two density measures pr esented in table three, binary and valued, individual activity, while roughly  X  of them are made during small group or peer-to-peer activi ties.It is easier to compare binary measures across networks.T he valued network scales up measure.This shows that not only are more connections made at least once during the individual act ivity than the others, but those connection is higher.

In this section we examine how the different social network sociograms.We then triangulate the sociograms with qualitative data. We do this in two steps.Firs t, we describe cliques, which are that the structure of the course members corresponds with activity and additional social network statis tics.This triangulat es our social different activity types. Figure 3 -Individual Acti vity Cliques (time 1) who are connected to each other at some degree of indirectness.In the case of our analysis, we identified 1-cliques, which mean that other.In a small group of 16 participants, going beyond the 1-network, the number of hops to ge t to any individual is relatively actor in Hollywood is within Ke vin Bacon X  X  7-clique.Most are within Kevin X  X  2-clique (aka, a  X  X acon Number X ).Even Brett Favre, a prominent American Footba ll player who appeared in one movie, There X  X  Something About Mary , has a  X  X acon Number X  of 2. some members participating in more than one clique.This corresponded with interview transc ripts where members described membership described in interviews.Figure three shows four cliques with overlapping membership form during individual members in each clique are visible during small group clique, though others (usually individuals assigned reviewing roles for that group) were also found within those cliques. analysis of CANS logs.This is what we would expect to occur groups may become visible th rough observation.Our coding and analysis of discussion posts does not show all of the same groups logs for revealing latent structure. structure of groups that are viewable through thesociograms.The differences are illustrated with clarity in figures three and four. Figure 4 -Small Group Ac tivity Cliques (time 2) The comparison shows that when members are assigned to group work,this is visible in the sociograms.We can also see which members have an interest in th eir own group, and other groups.In an online learning situation, the instructor might value these insights.For example, we can see that some members in the other members participate in as ma ny as five different groups.The visual structure of the three activ ity types triangulates our density data.

More study is required to confirm this. A second important finding is the relationship between these visualizations, the qualitative data and the social network statistic of betweenness centrality (or betw eenness).There are two types of high betweenness members: lurkers and group creators. In the first type, high betweenness members werelurkers, or those with a high number of reads and a sm all number of posts. These instructor and others with current tools. The second type of high betweenness members, group creators, emerged during our SNA during individual activities significantly triangulated with the groups identified by our interviews, and to a lesser extent with the ad hoc groups identified through discussion board coding.We noticed that, at this same time, user  X  X em16 X  had very high betweenness centrality. Mem16 was an active reader and poster during individual activities. Unlike high betweenness members who participated peripherally (read but didn X  X  post), Mem16 X  X  activities led to ad-hoc group fo rmation; Mem16 was a  X  X roup creator. X  After noting this trend, we went back and identified two key characteristics of Mem16 X  X  posts. First, the posts were provocative and often led to intense discussion among other members (a higher number of pos ts). Second, Mem16 X  X  posting behavior spanned more discussion threads than any other member. When talking with informants and analyzing discussion boards using content analysis, a set of members emerged as major measurement of contribution leve l emerged from a combination of data analysis methods.First, we used content analysis of self-identification into groups and the method of constant comparison performance in small group activities.Second, our open coding of discussion boards and interviews wa s refined into a set of themes indicating levels of interactivity.Highly interactive themes from the open coding are associated with higher performing members. Table 6 -Top Betweenness fo r Individual Activities The members we identified as high performers also showed up as these members were present in the  X  X ore X  of our core-periphery analysis.All except one of the members of the two groups who behavior are also in the core.The group member, who was in one most connections with other members among those in the online course.

Table six summarizes the core and periphery membership in this course, highlighting the core nature of most members of groups two and five.Periphery membersh ip is indicated by the blank column and row intersection.This core-periphery analysis shows types.

This relationship between core membership and centralization is somewhat intuitive, and it is the definition of core membership in the core-periphery analysis. The coordinating role of the most central members is confirmedthrough open coding, content idea that key group members may be identified by their behavior. More powerfully, it shows that these members can be identified through analysis of bi-directional interaction logs. Table 8 X  X NA Statsistics in High Performing Team Participation in the world involve s listening and speaking.Face to room.The same holds true in our assessment of highly central lead. Throughout our results we pointed out specific analysis types where the results with uni-directional (read) data are less relevant analysis presented here is only possible with the type of bi-directional logging system that capt ures users, context information and interaction of all kinds.Standard weblogs do not identify groups clearly. Activity type in a completely online course becomes visible in different ways through the applicati on of social network statistics and visualizations.In this st udy we have comprehensively analyzed interactions in a single online course. We explained how network density, betweenness, and centralization from bi-results suggest the possibility of a new kind of awareness tool for tools could help them to ensure that the individual and group expect across activity types creates opportunities for instructors to take a closer look and, if necessary, intervene when there is deviation from the expected patterns. There are also potential implications for student use.

Coaching peripheral members toward the core and encouraging group-creators to remain active are normal, physical classroom strategies for encouragi ng group activity.
