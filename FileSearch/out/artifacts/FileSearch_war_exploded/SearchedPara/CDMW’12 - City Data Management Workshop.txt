 Cities today have become highly dense, dynamic living areas for the majority of planet X  X  population and also focal points of innovation, commerce, and growth in a highly modern-ized world. Due to its intensifying importance, cities need to transform into sustainable, smarter and credible places to enable a tenantable and comfortable life for their citizens. City data, which is the source of our digitized knowledge about the cities, is a highly important element to achive this goal as it is the main i nput to build complex c ity ecosystems and to solve particular problems that are encountered in the cities today. In this respect, this workshop will provide a major forum to identify the challenges and opportunities in terms of better managing city data and to reveal its discrim-inating importance in various applications in a city ecosys-tem. As city data becomes more widespread and prevailing, it poses novel research problems which importantly are open to the investigation of a broad community of researchers in various fields.

Majority of people reside in cities (estimated over 70% of the world population by 2050) -a situation posing several challenges for municipalities, governments, citizens and busi-nesses. In an urbanizing world, cities comprise of different systems ranging from transport, water, and electricity data management infrastructures to social, communication and service networks. The data emerging from these systems is a precious resource to make cities more intelligent, innovative and integrated beyond the boundaries of isolated applica-tions. Today, large amounts of data are retrieved from sen-sors, mobile devices, social network messages, governmen-tal applications, or utility services. Cleansing, integrating, managing, and analysing this data to turn it into actionable insights is critical to make cities smarter. The nature of this data as being open, heterogeneous, and multi-domain poses novel research problems which are, importantly, open to the investigation of a broad community of researchers due to its public availability (as opposed to enterprise data, large amounts of city data have been made publicly available, e.g. see Dublinked 1 ).

City Data Management covers a broad range of topics, from the acquisition, cleaning, annotation and integration of raw data to techniques for searching, mining, and moni-toring. Also industry has joined governments and research communities to develop solutions that leverage city data in intelligent platforms to find smart solutions to particular problems, such as optimizing maintenance schedules, early detection of leaky pipes, or disaster planning. This work-shop will focus on those techniques for managing city data to transform cities into smarter living areas.

The focus of the workshop is to bring together researchers in various research communities, as well as stakeholders, administrators, urban planners and industry people facing the challenges of city data management. We observe that city data management differs from both enterprise-scale and Web-scale data management. It requires concepts and tech-niques from a variety of fields in an interdisciplinary way. The topics coincide with all three tracks of CIKM X 12 (i.e. DB, IR, KM) and are of high interest for researchers and practitioners from these three fields. This makes CIKM unique as a venue to organize such a workshop. In addition, the vision of smarter cities has received a lot of attention from big industry players (e.g. IBM, Oracle, etc.). We be-http://www. dublinked.ie/ lieve that this workshop will be a common ground to bring industry and academia together to discuss novel challenges and opportunities.
As the cities are the major elements of the modern world and the source of a vast amount of digital data, they intro-duce many challenges for the data management researchers. In this context, one of the main challenges includes the positioning of the city data management topic among the other types of data management (e.g. enterprise, Web) by identifying the unique characteristics of city data (e.g. heterogeneity, openness, geospatially, privacy, data source etc.) and by listing the requirements for managing such data. Yet another challenge is also to show how the partic-ular problems (e.g. urban planning, resource optimization, emergency evacuation, transportation planning) of cities can be addressed by the information contained within the vast amount of available heterogeneous city data. Then drawing a parallel between the topics of city data management and the topics of the major fields such as databases, information retrival or knowledge management will be a challenge of the workshop. The main outcome will be to produce a roadmap and a community of researchers interested in this topic in or-der to guide further developments and technological progress towards smarter cities.
Addressing the challenges in a heterogeneous city envi-ronment, relevant topics for city data management can be grouped into four categories. The first category addresses the acquisition of city data from numerous sources and its maintenance at a large-scale. It mainly consists of the acqui-sition,integration, cleaning and storage of the data as well as its representation with actual semantics. In addition, man-aging this large-scale data [1] and achieving interoperability and openness [2] adds an additional point to achieve this tar-get. In fact, the nature of the data highly varies ranging from the data acquired from senso r streams to the social media and requires a broad outlook and complementary techniques within a large perspective. In addition, the privacy, prove-nance and security of the city data is also highly important when the data is exchanged among different parties within acity.

Second, we will focus on intuitive, end-user oriented tech-niques for searching and querying city data in order to ease its access by stakeholders, citizens and decision makers. In this respect it is a crucial application area for traditional information retrieval techniques and search on structured data [3, 4, 5] in order to enable easy-access to heterogeneous city data which includes both, e.g., unstructured and struc-tured counterparts. In addition, the major topics to query the city data include database query processing, stream query processing, and question answering that leads to derive de-tailed answers to the complex information needs of the users. These different techniques consitute the main building blocks of an emerging city data management system today and highly important to meet the needs of different stakeholders and citizens.

As a third category, the application of data analytics and mining will shed light on our understanding of major city operations. In particular this includes discovering hidden patterns and extracting analytical information from a large amount of city data to provide better explanations to vari-ous city events and happenings. In addition, the application of emerging machine learning techniques [6] offers many op-portunities in this emerging topic. This is highly important especially for decision makers and city stakeholders in order to support them when making critical decisions about the problems of the city.

Finally, monitoring the city data will be covered in order to better anticipate problems, respond to crises, and man-age resources. Mainly this includes the processing of the real-time data and detecting critical city events in an ef-fective and efficient manner. Furthermore, monitoring the city events does not only include detecting but also requires taking proactive actions as a response to unexpected condi-tions and unprecedented situations [7]. Taking the benefits of data analytics and complex event processing, the target of city monitoring in a scope of smart cities of the future will be total awareness throughout the city and foresight for better anticipation of any upcoming events that enable alertness and responsiveness.
