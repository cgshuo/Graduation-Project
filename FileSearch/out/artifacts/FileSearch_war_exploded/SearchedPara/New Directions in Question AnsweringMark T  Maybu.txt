With goals as intuitive and desirable as they are challenging, the field of automated question answering has generated growing interest in the past few years. The increased momentum is apparent in the spread of research groups working on the topic, the number of relevant Ph.D. theses, papers that are now a common occurrence in the proceedings of top-rated conferences related to the topic, the scale of commercial en-deavors, and the steady financial commitments of various agencies to government-sponsored evaluations and research programs. The last of these constitutes the main justification of New Directions in Question Answering , a relatively recent contribution to the field. As shown in Table 1, the book suggests new milestones and directions of research which concurrently increase:
Even if considered in isolation rather than combined together, the majority of these goals are already very far reaching. Most readers will have an immediate intuition as to how difficult it would be in practice to answer, with reliable consistency, questions of seemingly unbounded complexity such as Has there been any change in the official opinion from China toward the 2001 annual U.S. report on human rights since its release? (page 83),
How has pollution in the Black Sea affected the fishing industry, and what are the sources of this pollution? (page 134), or What part did ITT (International Telephone and Telegraph) and Ana-conda Copper play in the Chilean 1970 election? (page 210). Even if the question complexity is limited to the factual type, current fact-seeking question-answering technology has only a moderate impact on global-scale information-seeking environments such as Web search. The fact that quite a few chapters of the book are motivated as departures from 414 fact-seeking question answering should ensure that the book will attract the attention of intrigued and avid readers.

AAAI symposium on question answering (Maybury 2003). As a strength, the chapters provide a multitude of refreshing, often orthogonal perspectives on question answering.
The chapters are mostly independent units, with few cross-references. It is therefore possible to focus first on the chapters that seem most relevant and read other chapters later. In fact, out-of-order perusal may reduce the occasional overlap in the sections that motivate various chapters individually, as they often share, as a common theme, the desire to move beyond fact-seeking question answering.
 more-practical methods that are accompanied by thorough evaluations, I recommend chapters 5, 17, and 18. In particular, Chapter 5 (Ralph Weischedel, Jinxi Xu, and Ana
Licuanan) takes a look at answering biographical questions. Since such questions often take very simple forms (e.g., Who is Edgar Froese? ), the challenge relative to other of biographical questions, and of the related class of definitional questions (e.g., What is a metronome? ), is in selecting and assembling an answer from text fragments that are in-herently scattered across multiple documents. The chapter combines clear explanations of the method and system architecture with a nice walk-through example that shows the information flow among different stages of processing of a sample question. Most notably, the evaluation section more than makes up for the relatively small size of the test set (less than 30 questions) by analyzing the system output from different angles and pursuing both a subjective and an automated evaluation of the results.
 that consider fact-seeking questions. Following a pragmatic approach, the chapter introduces a series of experiments and comparative evaluations of a task that is more relaxed than those that motivate other chapters and yet has high potential impact in practice. More precisely, the authors efficiently address the problem of extracting more-accurate document snippets or summaries in response to users X  questions, in addi-tion to output returned by Web search engines. Chapter 18 (John Prager, Jennifer
Chu-Carroll, and Krzysztof Czuba) is one of my favorites. It is a very effective and enlightening tour through a collection of different answer extraction techniques em-bedded in a single system, which could also be seen as a meta-question-answering system. The various extraction techniques (statistical, pattern-based, definitional, dossier-based) are often radically different, yet complement one another well, resulting in one of the most modular architectures for question answering described to date. attempts to formalize various problems related to question answering, without a focus on complete evaluation, Chapters 2, 7, 8, and 13 offer an enjoyable lecture. Chap-ter 2 (Eric Nyberg et al.) aims at capturing the requirements of advanced question answering and their impact on system design. The challenges that face the push toward question-answering systems of increased complexity become apparent to the attentive reader after reading the chapter, especially challenges of practicability and scalability. Indeed, such issues become important for any system that would actually attempt to perform AI-style planning in a broad domain (Section 2.3.2). Similarly, it may be very challenging to find common linguistic representations (Section 2.3.1) to use across highly modular systems for encoding internal information, as the informa-tion sources themselves can vary widely from unstructured text on one end of the spectrum to full-blown knowledge bases on the other end. Chapter 7 (Claire Cardie et al.) describes a representation scheme for annotating opinions, as opposed to facts, as they occur in textual documents. The intuition is that identifying and extract-ing opinions automatically from text would be essential in any attempts to answer questions with multiple possible perspectives, such as What is the general opinion from the press on the recent U2 world tour? The proposed annotation scheme and its motivations are described in detail, exemplified in a few examples, and shown to provide promising interannotator agreement scores despite the difficulty of the task.
Chapter 8 ( James Pustejovski et al.) provides an overview of an annotation standard for representing events and temporal expressions as they occur in text. The representation language is the product of significant research efforts and numerous iterative improve-ments. The current version of the language was fueled by a series of government-sponsored workshops dedicated to the topic of temporal awareness in the context of question answering (Pustejovsky 2002). In Chapter 13 (Marc Light et al.), an empirical analysis of a corpus of questions enables the authors to identify examples of reuse scenarios, in which future questions could be answered better by using information previously available to the system (e.g., in the form of previously submitted questions or answers already returned to users). The authors acknowledge that some of the proposed categories of reuse are very difficult to implement in working system modules.
Dizier), and 21 (Deborah McGuinness and Paulo Pinheiro da Silva) delve into knowledge-based question answering and supporting inferential processes for veri-fying candidate answers and providing justifications. For the audience looking for an insider X  X  view into existing question-answering systems, Chapters 14 (Noriko Tomuro and Steven Lytinen) and 16 (Boris Katz et al.) will be particularly interesting. Rather than proposing any new directions, they share some of the practical lessons learned while providing users with answers from FAQ files (Chapter 14) and from the Web seen as a database of facts (Chapter 16).
 relatively more language-dependent, as they require larger and more-complex re-sources of various kinds. Given the variety of topics already covered by its chap-ters, the book limits the scope of the discussion to questions and answer sources in
English. Many lessons learned through experiments on question answering in differ-ent languages can be found in Chen and Lin (2002), Kando and Ishikawa (2004), and Peters and Borri (2004).
 information retrieval (Gaizauskas, Hepple, and Greenwood 2004), natural language processing (Ravin, Prager, and Harabagiu 2001; de Rijke and Webber 2003), information extraction, and knowledge representation and reasoning (Harabagiu and Chaudhri 2002), to name only a few. Overall, the book represents a useful reference for readers interested in possible future developments in the field. There are a few scattered ty-pos and very rare inconsistencies, including a paragraph on page 173 that somehow slipped into the final manuscript while still marked as To r e v i e w . It will be interesting to compare the present and near-future progress in question answering against the aggres-sive milestones from the proposal in the first chapter of the book.
