 Collaborative Information Seeking/Retrieval (CIS/CIR) has given rise to several challenges in terms of search behavior analysis, retrieval model formalization as well as interface design. However, the major issue of evaluation in CIS/CIR is still underexplored. The goal of this workshop is to inves-tigate the evaluation challenges in CIS/CIR with the hope of building standardized evaluation frameworks, methodolo-gies, and task specifications that would foster and grow the research area (in a collaborative fashion).

The paradigm of CIS/CIR refers to methodologies and technologies that support collective-knowledge sharing within a work team in order to solve a shared complex prob-lem [2, 3]. One main challenge in CIS/CIR is to satisfy the mutual beneficial goals of both individual users and the col-laborative group while maintaining a reasonable level of cog-nitive effort [7]. Evaluating CIS/CIR is challenging, as there are a variety of confounding factors such as the multi-user context, the exploratory aspect of the search through multi-session search activities, the multiplicity of relevance factors, related aspects including models, methods, techniques and examples of CIS/CIR in theory and in practice. Original and unpublished papers are welcome on any aspects includ-ing (non exhaustive list):
