 Social intelligence can be described as a combination of users X  behavior and social interactions. Over recent years, the ubiquitous use of computers and the World Wide Web enabled people to participate and interact with each other in numerous Internet-mediated communities, including forums, discussion groups, and social networks. Observing the user-generated content resulting from such interactions offers computer scientists unprecedented opportunities for studying the collective in-telligence of online communities. This special Section is a step towards understanding the fundamental mechanisms that govern the dynamics of online social interactions.
The response to the call for papers was very strong: We received 16 manuscripts, and 6 of them were eventually selected for inclusion in this special Section. The ac-cepted contributions fall into three categories, which study the content, the users, and the non-textual information of the social Web.

The first group of approaches focuses on the content generated and shared in the social Web. Herdagdelen et al. observe that manual construction of knowledge repos-itories is very resource-intensive and hard to scale, while fully automatic techniques often yield suboptimal quality. In  X  X ootstrapping a Game with a Purpose for Common-sense Collection X , the authors develop a game to entice users to refine the knowledge automatically mined from the Web. In  X  X olksonomy-Based Term Extraction for Word Cloud Generation X , Carmel et al. study term extraction in resource-scarce domains. The authors show that it is possible to learn from existing folksonomies to accurately tag items in sparsely-tagged and even in nontagged domains.

The second category of approaches explicitly models user behavior in addition to characterizing the content. In the light of the ever growing popularity of online re-view sites, there exist multiple incentives for less-than-scrupulous users and busi-ness owners to post fake reviews. In  X  X dentify Online Store Review Spammers via Social Review Graph X , Wang et al. tackle this phenomenon by building a heteroge-neous graph of reviewers, reviews, and stores and exploit the interactions between the nodes of this graph to identify spam. In  X  X sing Stochastic Models to Describe and Predict Social Dynamics of Web Users X , Lerman et al. develop a method for predicting story popularity on Digg, which distinguishes between the effects of the network and the individual user X  X  interests. In previous studies, modeling the con-tent topics and modeling the communities of users has been often done separately. In  X  X atent Community Topic Analysis: Integration of Community Discovery with Topic Modeling X , Yin et al. propose a joint framework for topic modeling and user commu-nity discovery and empirically demonstrate the benefits of modeling these two tasks jointly.

In the third category, content augmentation with non-textual information is ex-plored. To date, media items shared in the social Web (such as images and video) are usually characterized by their surrounding text. In  X  X atent Geospatial Semantics of Social Media X , Sizov expands this representation with geospatial information and shows the effect of spatial awareness in sample applications such as content catego-rization and clustering.

We hope this special Section provides the readers with a sample of the state-of-the-art in the field, showcasing a variety of approaches to principled modeling of user behavior and user-generated content. To conclude, we would like to thank the authors who submitted their work to this special Section. We would also like to thank the reviewers for their comprehensive reviews and constructive comments.
