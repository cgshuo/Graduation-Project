 How can we model users X  preferences? How do anomalies, fraud, and spam effect our models of normal users? How can we modify our models to catch fraudsters? In this tutorial we will answer these questions -connecting graph analy-sis tools for user behavior modeling to anomaly and fraud detection. In particular, we will focus on the application of subgraph analysis, label propagation, and latent factor models to static, evolving, and attributed graphs.
For each of these techniques we will give a brief explana-tion of the algorithms and the intuition behind them. We will then give examples of recent research using the tech-niques to model, understand and predict normal behavior. With this intuition for how these methods are applied to graphs and user behavior, we will focus on state-of-the-art research showing how the outcomes of these methods are effected by fraud, and how they have been used to catch fraudsters.

In this tutorial we focus on understanding anomaly and fraud detection through the lens of normal user behavior modeling. The data mining and machine learning commu-nities have developed a plethora of models and methods for understanding user behavior. However, these methods gen-erally assume that the behavior is that of real, honest peo-ple. On the other hand, fraud detection systems frequently use similar techniques as those used in modeling  X  X ormal X  behavior, but are often framed as an independent problem. However, by focusing on the relations and intersections of the two perspectives we can gain a more complete under-standing of the methods and hopefully inspire new research joining these two communities.
This tutorial is aimed at anyone interested in modeling and understanding user behavior, from data mining and machine learning researchers to practitioners from industry and government. For those new to the field, the tutorial will cover the necessary background material to understand these systems and will offer a concise, intuitive overview of the state-of-the-art. Additionally, the tutorial aims to offer a new perspective that will be valuable and interesting even for researchers with more experience in these domains. For those having worked in classic user behavior modeling, we will demonstrate how fraud can effect commonly-used mod-els that expect normal behavior, with the hope that future models will directly account for fraud. For those having worked in fraud detection systems, we hope to inspire new research directions through connecting with recent develop-ments in modeling  X  X ormal X  behavior.
