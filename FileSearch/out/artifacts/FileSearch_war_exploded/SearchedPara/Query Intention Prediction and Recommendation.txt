 In this tutorial we first characterize user queries before fo-cusing in two important problems related to search engines: query intention prediction and query recommendation. H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Search pro-cess Algorithms Query characterization, query intention prediction, query suggestion, query recommendation.
Web search engines record information about the queries that people write, forming what is called a query log . Since a large search engine receive hundreds of millions of queries from millions of users per day, query logs constitute an in-valuable resource for understanding the kinds of needs that people have. In addition, clicks after queries relate those interests to actual content. Even queries without clicks or answers imply important missing synonyms or content. In fact, queries are perhaps the best source of on-line wisdom of crowds in the Web [7].

The frequency of query words follow a Zipf X  X  law with pa-rameter  X  , that is, the i -th most frequent word has O ( i  X   X  ) occurrences. However, this is less biased than the distribu -tion of the queries, that have larger  X  . In turn, this is less biased than the distribution of words in Web text. In addi-tion, the correlation between the frequency of words in Web pages and in queries varies but is not high. Hence, what people search is not really what people publish in the Web.
One important question is the following: is the Zipf X  X  law due to (a) two groups of people, one asking popular queries, and the other one asking unique queries, or (b) a combina-tion of all people asking both types of queries? In a recent paper [5] it is shown that the power law and, in particular, the long tail, are due to the later case.
The first and still most popular categorization of queries in the Web was proposed by Broder [4]. He defined three
