 1. Introduction
Road traffic congestion is a critical problem accelerated by an exponential increase in the number of vehicles and high level of urbanization. Optimal utilization of the existing infrastructure can effectively reduce the congestion levels without the necessity of constructing newer infrastructure to accommodate the increased traffic volume ( Srinivasan et al., 2006 ). Traffic signals assist in improving the utilization of the road network by maximizing the volume movements served at the intersection and reducing the frequency and severity of the crashes. However, improper selection of signal timings can cause severe bottleneck to the traffic flow thereby increasing the travel time and delay experienced by vehicles.
The signal timings at an intersection can be optimized either by using pre-timed or traffic responsive methods. In pre-timed signals, optimal value of green time required to ensure smooth flow of vehicles is calculated based on the historical data of traffic flow and volume patterns collected over a period of time from the actual traffic network ( Choy et al., 2003 ). This high dependence on historical traffic information limits the ability of pre-timed signals to cope with any sudden variation of traffic from the training pattern and are prone to switching losses. These limitations are overcome by real-time vehicle actuated methods like MOVA ( Peirce and Webb, 1990; Vincent and Peirce, 1988 ),
LHVORA ( Kronborg and Davidsson, 1993 ) and SOS ( Kronborg and Davidsson, 1996 ) where the extension or termination of the green signal of a phase is decided based on refinement gap extension process, mathematical optimization, or relative delays of traffic flows. Optimal positioning of the detectors at the intersection can enhance the performance of the vehicle actuated methods. Increasing the number of detectors increases the accuracy of vehicle detection. In vehicle actuated methods, green time of the phase is extended by a pre-specified block period on detection of vehicle and even a sparse traffic flow can cause significant increase in the delay of vehicles at crossroads of the intersection. Further, the green time is not held for an upstream platoon causing a higher percentage of vehicles to be stopped at an intersection ( Koonce et al., 2008 ).

Adaptive signal control is a concept where vehicular traffic in a road network is detected at a point upstream and/or downstream and an algorithm is used to predict when and where traffic will be and to make signal adjustments at downstream intersections based on those predictions. The prediction can be performed using hybrid techniques like neural networks, fuzzy logic to predict the expected traffic volume and to overcome the limitations of vehicle actuated controllers. Some of the prominent works related to adaptive hybrid traffic signal control are ( Ball et al., 1997; Teodorovic et al., 2001; Gao et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2002; Guo et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2006; Wunderlich et al., 2008 ).
However, most of the experiments were limited to single isolated intersection. This significantly simplifies the network optimiza-tion problem and obscures the large overhead associated with establishing coordination among neighboring intersections to reduce the overall delay experienced by vehicles inside a large road network.

Traffic-responsive signal control methods such as SCOOT ( Bretherton et al., 1986; Hunt et al., 1981 ), SCATS ( Dutta et al., 2008; Sims and Finlay, 1984 ) and GLIDE Keong (1993) have been successfully applied to large road networks and form the primary traffic management system in many countries. They have a centralized architecture and decisions concerning the green time, offset, and cycle time are made centrally in traffic control centers using the data collected from the inductive loop detectors placed near the stop line of each intersection. Their main drawback is the amount of information to be communicated to the central server and the computational overhead for data mining operations required to extract relevant information to calculate the degree of saturation of each lane ( Choy et al., 2003 ). The problem worsens with increase in the network size making it computationally intractable.

In Srinivasan et al. (2006) , a hierarchical multi-agent system based signal control (HMS) was introduced to reduce the communication overhead and semi-distributed control by provid-ing enhanced decision making capability to the intersection agents. A group of intersection agents were in turn monitored by a zonal agent. The zonal agent computes the optimal value of green time with an objective of reducing the overall delay of the group formed rather than individual intersection. The zonal agents communicate with the central supervising agent that calculates the network-wide optimized parameters for each intersection. Each intersection agent calculates its own green time value based on the local data, and can execute the action policy provided there is no conflict with zonal and central controlling agent X  X  plan. This effectively reduced the amount of information communicated and more autonomy is provided to agents at lower level of hierarchy. Application of distributed architecture and the improvements in performance efficiency achieved when using it for large road networks has been demonstrated successfully in Jee-Hyong and Hyung (1999) , Balmer et al. (2004) , and Yang et al. (2008) . Few other traffic signal controls designed and applied for large traffic networks are Li et al. (2003) , Kosonen (2003) , and Chiu and Chand (1993) , but were based on simple type-1 fuzzy inference system. Type-1 fuzzy systems lack the ability to handle uncertainties associated with the antecedents and consequents of the rule base necessitat-ing the use of type-2 fuzzy logic ( Karnik et al., 1999 ), where a range of values is assigned to membership grade rather than a single crisp value. Some of the characteristics of type-2 fuzzy sets that makes it suitable for control of traffic signal control are as follows ( Wu and Mendel, 2002 ).
 Non-stationary sensor noise.
 Stochastic nature of driver X  X  behavior.
 Use of rules to control vehicle flow and signals.
 Use of expert knowledge for mining fuzzy rules from opinions.
In this paper, a multi-agent distributed architecture with type-2 fuzzy decision making that is capable of handling all the uncertainties associated with traffic for control of traffic signals has been developed. The paper is organized into following sections. Section 2 gives details of the traffic signal control problem and the architecture of the proposed signal control. Section 3 discusses the performance metrics used to compare the performance of the proposed signal control with benchmarks. Section 4 discusses the simulation platform used and details the working of the benchmarks. Section 5 gives the results followed by the detailed discussion of the performance of the signal controller for various simulation scenarios. Section 6 provides the conclusion and a short discussion on how the performance could be further improved. 2. Traffic signal control
The problem of reducing the total mean delay experienced by vehicles inside the road network requires increasing the free flow of traffic at intersections and reducing the waiting time of vehicles to maximum possible extent. The task can be divided into a sub-problem of finding the appropriate green time required to ensure smooth traffic flow at each intersection. In centralized control all the signal timings are computed in a central server based on the current traffic information communicated from all the intersec-tions. The computational and data mining requirements are enormous and creates a severe bottleneck in case of failure of central controller. This necessitates the use of distributed architecture with autonomous signal control at each intersection.
Multi-agent system provides one such architecture, where each signal is designed as an autonomous agent capable of deciding its own actions based on the information collected from loop detectors at each intersection. However, communication between agents is required to enhance its sensing capabilities and to prevent sub-optimal green time calculation for the phase in progress. The applicability of multi-agent system to traffic management and optimization have been demonstrated in Bazzan et al. (2005) , Hernandez et al. (2002) , Fayech et al. (2002) ,and France and
Ghorbani (2003) . Most of the multi-agent papers published utilized the agent architecture and the communication capabilities, however, the decision making were based on probabilities or game theoretical methods that were unable to handle uncertainties associated with the inputs and rules ( Jee-Hyong and Hyung, 1999;
Bazzan, 2005 ). In this paper, a multi-agent architecture based on type-2 fuzzy decision and neighboring intersection belief model is proposed. 2.1. Proposed agent architecture
The overall structure of the proposed multi-agent architecture is shown in Fig. 1 . It shows nine distributed agents communicating with their immediate neighbors to perform the desired action. The proposed agent system does not have a specific central agent management structure as all the agents are homogenous with each agent maintaining a directory service for the connected agents and have equal decision making capabilities. This archi-tecture is feasible because of the static nature of the intersection agents. The structure of each individual agent is shown in Fig. 2 . Each agent is composed of five modules that operates in parallel.
Each agent receives data from the sensors attached to the intersection associated with it and the information communicated from the neighboring agents. The agent X  X  fuzzy decision system computes the level of cooperation required between the agents and decides on the green time required to achieve smaller vehicle travel time delay. 2.2. Input data
The flow rate of vehicles in a link can be calculated as the difference between the upstream arrival and downstream departure flow rates for each lane with permissible movements in the link during the specific phase in progress. Sampling of the data is done at an pre specified time interval, which is around 10s (Minimum green time to be allocated to each phase in a signal): f  X  where c g is the current green time for the phase in progress, n is the number of links having right of way, l is the number of lanes in the link having right of way, X T is the sampling period and f , f down is the upstream and downstream vehicle count value.
The information of queue is calculated as the number of vehicles queuing in lanes with permissible movements during the phase that just ended. In order to provide free flow for all vehicles in queue in all links, maximum value of the queue formed is used as an input to compute the required green tim e. (2) shows the mathematical expression for obtaining the maximum queue from the links:  X  q where q ij up , q ij down , is the upstream and downstream vehicle count experienced during the phase and q ij prev is the queue formed during the previous phase.

It is assumed that the arrival rate of the vehicles can be approximated by a uniform distribution, as the average value is calculated from the data sampled at relatively high frequency and can adequately compensate the increase in queue experienced at the end of phase. 2.3. Type-2 fuzzy sets
It is extremely difficult to mathematically model the traffic flow and determine the appropriate signal timings because of the stochastic nature of traffic, non-linear relationship of signal timing with traffic and the influence of driver X  X  behavior on routing. Hence it is essential to use decision models capable of handlin g uncertainties and can be easily developed using the expert opinion. Traffic is usually controlled by rules deve loped based on expert knowledge. Decision models can be effectively modeled using type-1 fuzzy logic.
However, assignment of a crisp value to the input (antecedents of the rule) lends it incapable of handling uncertainties associated with the rules and the inputs. These limitations of type-1 fuzzy logic can be overcome by type-2 fuzzy sets ( Karnik and Mendel, 1999 ).
Type-2 fuzzy set ( Karnik et al., 1999 ) is a modified version of type-1 fuzzy logic with a non-crisp primary membership grade and a secondary membership grade for each value in the primary domain. The basic mathematical expression of the type-2 fuzzy sets can be derived from type-1 fuzzy system ( Mendel et al., 2005 ) representation: ~
A  X f X  X  x , u  X  , m ~ A  X  x , u  X  X j8 x A X , 8 u A J x D  X  0 , 1 g X  3  X  fuzzy set, which is usually defined as A  X f X  x , m A  X  x  X  X j8 x 0 r m
A  X  x  X  r 1. Type-2 fuzzy sets have a n additional dimension u associated with it. In simple words, for x  X  DiacriticalGrave ; x ,the fuzzy membership function of a type-1 system will have a crisp single value, whereas a type-2 fuzzy set would have multiple values associated with it. General or no n-singleton type -2 fuzzy systems requires type-reduction to convert the type-2 fuzzy outputs to an equivalent type-1 fuzzy output before calculating a single crisp usable value. This conversion incr eases the computational complex-ity as the number of embedded type-1 fuzzy sets are relatively larger and computing the centroid of all the embedded sets is computationally intractable. In order to obtain a solution in a relatively smaller number of itera tions, interval type-2 fuzzy sets were used. Interval type-2 fuzzy set ( Mendel et al., 2006 )is simplified general type-2 fuzzy set with a secondary membership value of one in the primary membership domain and zero outside of it. Interval type-2 fuzzy sets reduces the dimensionality of the generalized type-2 fuzzy sets but maintains the footprint of uncertainty in the primary domain. Details of the interval type-2 fuzzy set and various type-reduction techniques are given in Wu and Mendel (2002) and Mendel et al. (2006) . 2.4. Fuzzy decision process
The decision making module is the core of the decision system that calculates the optimized green time required for each phase in the cycle. The decision making system is composed of two modules  X  belief and fuzzy decision module operates in parallel to determine the level of cooperation between agents and the optimum green time required for a phase. The level of cooperation between the agents is computed in the form of weight assigned to the flow input of the fuzzy decision module.

Traffic flow depends on the upstream and downstream traffic volume and the queue spill back from the neighboring intersec-tions. It provides a good indication of the state of traffic at the neighboring intersection. Therefore, belief model of the neighbor-ing intersection can be designed using a combination of the information received from the adjacent agents and the locally observed traffic flow. The belief model computes the weights required to scale the inputs to reduce the overall travel delay. The overall details of the decision making module are shown in Fig. 3 .
The two type-2 fuzzy modules used in the decision system were designed based on the following assumptions All the fuzzy sets considered belong to interval type-2 sets.
The membership functions of the antecedent and consequent can be represented fully by Gaussian primary membership functions.

In order to compensate the non-stationary noise, Gaussian primary membership function is assumed to have fixed mean but uncertain variance.

The fuzzy operators used were product implication and t-norm minimum function.

Karnik X  X endel type reduction algorithm Karnik and Mendel (2001) for defuzzification of type-2 fuzzy output. 2.4.1. Fuzzification
The queue and flow data is clustered into three regions and the universe of discourse of the inputs are decided based on the hotspot and saturation flow rate parameters. Hotspot refers to the links that experience a queue length greater than the threshold number of vehicles beyond which the link can be classified to be in severe congestion state. Vehicle count of 13 was used as a threshold value to classify a link as hotspot ( Srinivasan et al., 2006 ). Saturation flow rate refers to the equivalent hourly rate at which vehicles can traverse an intersection approach under prevailing conditions, assuming a constant green indication at all time and no loss time, in vehicles per hour per lane.
Gaussian membership function was used to cluster and assign overlapping membership value to the inputs (4). The mean values of the Gaussian functions are the center of the clusters formed and the values are chosen to be closer to the values used in Choy et al. (2003) . The upper and lower boundary standard deviation values are calculated based on the flow rates and queues experienced at different period of time on different days of a week. The fuzzified antecedents and consequents of the fuzzy rules are as shown in Fig. 4 :  X  x  X  X  exp where x A X ,  X  s l , s u is the lower and upper standard deviation value of the universe of discourse, and X mean is the mean value used for the Gaussian curve.

The consequents were designed as type-2 fuzzy sets to account for the uncertainties associated with scaling factor and the signal timings. In this work, the type-2 membership functions were developed based on heuristics and past research work ( Srinivasan et al., 2006 ) type-1 fuzzy membership functions blurred to create lower and upper membership grade. The details of antecedent and consequent membership functions are shown in Fig. 4 . The maximum green time allocated for a phase is fixed at 60s and minimum green time as 10s to avoid short phase and increased travel time delay. 2.4.2. Rule base
Selection of appropriate rules and matching of the antecedent to consequent is an important objective. In general practice, the rules are created by trial and error method based on expert knowledge. Type-2 fuzzy system produces better results than type-1 fuzzy system under these conditions ( Karnik and Mendel, 1999 ). The structure of rule base developed is as shown.
Level of cooperation decision fuzzy system  X  If { flow is high } and { Neighbor status is low } then { Level of cooperation is low }.
Green time decision fuzzy system  X  If { Queue is low } and { flow is high } then { traffic is low }.

Tables 1 and 2 show the rule base for both the belief and the fuzzy decision module. The initial rule base was designed based on the understanding of Niittymaki (2001) and Srinivasan et al. (2006) . The rule base was fine-tuned and validated based on a small section of the network consisting of six intersections. The initial origin-destination matrix was modified from the original matrix to avoid saturation of the network. The rules were initially modeled for fuzzy decision module without any communication between the agents. Validation of the rule base was done by comparing the total mean delay experienced by a vehicle inside a network to GLIDE traffic signal controller. A detailed explanation on GLIDE is provided in Section 4. The rule base that provided the smallest delay in comparison with GLIDE was used in this work.
The same procedure was repeated for the agent system with communication capabilities to develop the belief model. The initial rule base was developed arbitrarily and on understanding of the relationship between traffic flow and queue. 2.4.3. Inference engine
Inference is the key component of the fuzzy system. Based on the antecedents, the firing level of each rule in the rule base is calculated and applied to the consequent fuzzy sets. In type-2 fuzzy systems, the output of the fuzzy inference engine for the l -th fuzzy rule can be written as in (5) and (7):
The weight parameter for the flow input was calculated based on the instantaneous flow value and the communicated neighbor status data. The data received from the neighboring agents was aggregated using the  X  X ax X  function to enable coordination with respect to most congested neighbor. The weight para-meter calculated is inversely proportional to the level of cooperation among the agents. When the weight value is higher, the flow input is assigned a higher membership value (6) making the fuzzy system more inclined towards the membership grade of queue input, and ensures the level of cooperation between the agents to be lower and output less dependent on neighboring agents. Flow input was used for deciding the level of cooperation, as it is an averaged value that reflects the overall traffic condition of the neighboring intersections and depends on upstream, downstream and queue spill back inputs. The instan-taneous value of queue was determined using  X  X ax X  function as they indicate current traffic condition at an intersection and ensure the green time calculated is with respect to maximum congested lane:  X  x  X  X  w exp where m B 1 l  X  y  X  , m B 2 l  X  y  X  are the outputs of the fuzzy systems, are the type-2 membership functions for the antecedent inputs for the l -th rule, m fl l functions of the inputs. Since the interval type-2 fuzzy system is used for determining the optimized green time, the firing level obtained will also be in interval set: F  X  x  X  X  X  f l  X  x  X  , f l  X  x  X  X  f l , f l  X  8  X  The lower and the upper bounds of the level of cooperation deciding type-2 fuzzy system of the inference engine can be written as in Eqs. (9) and (10), respectively: f  X  x  X  X  sup f  X  x  X  X  sup In a similar fashion, the lower and the upper bounds of the decision making fuzzy system can be written as in Eqs. (11) and (12): f  X  x  X  X  sup f  X  x  X  X  sup The output from the fuzzy system for all the rules can be aggregated together as in Eqs. (13) and (14)
B 1  X  y  X  X 
B 2  X  y  X  X  where N refers to the number of rules used in the decision making.
Karnik and Mendel (2001) algorithm was employed to convert the type-2 fuzzy outputs into type-1 fuzzy output. The crisp output is calculated as average value of the right (15) and left (16) end points computed iteratively through the calculation of the centroid for the large number of embedded type-1 fuzzy sets: y  X  y  X  y  X  y r  X  y l 2  X  17  X  The main objective of the firing level is to minimize the lower bound and maximize the upper bound. As the number of rules were restricted to a maximum of twelve, the number of iterations required to compute the left and right points is limited to twelve and can be performed under severe time restrictions. 2.5. Communication module The communication modules performs multiple functions. It maintains a directory service of all agents that are connected to the incoming and outgoing links of the intersection. The communication module receives the neighbor status data from the outgoing links of the adjacent agents directly connected to it. The neighbor status data is the percentage of the current green time of the phase to the maximum permissible green time:
N  X  X  g phase = g max  X  100  X  18  X  where N is the traffic status data transmitted as neighbor status data to other agents, g phase is the current green time of the phase, g max is the maximum green time permissible (60s).

It also communicates the state of the traffic at the intersection controlled by the agent to all its neighboring intersections, and is responsible for coordination and cooperation among the agents.
In absence of communication between agents, the limited sensing capabilities of the sensors associated with each agent provides only a partial view of the environment and the actions selected can produce higher delays in the long run because of the interleaved agent environment. The communication module serves to enhance the view of each agent by sharing information with other agents to achieve global optimal solution.
Communication module is also responsible for transmitting the current traffic state information (Neighbor status data) to all the agents in its directory service. The information is sent out as a broadcast asynchronously and stored in the buffer memory to avoid synchronization related issues. 2.6. Action implementation module
The action implementation module adjusts green time of the phase in a traffic signal based on the optimized green time calculated by fuzzy decision making module. It ensures the completion of all phases in a cycle before adjusting the green time so that vehicles in lanes that do not have right of way during a specific phase do not experience delay because of extension of green time. In case of failure of fuzzy decision making module, it maintains the timings calculated in the previous cycle for all phases till an update from decision making module is received and serves as the main communication interface between the traffic signal and agent. 3. Performance metrics
The performance metrics used to evaluate the proposed multi-agent system are total mean delay and current mean speed of vehicle. Total mean delay refers to the difference between the actual travel time and calculated free flow time ( Koonce et al., 2008 ). Actual travel time is the summation of travel time from start to destination point and the traffic signal induced delay. The free flow time is the time taken to travel from start to destination point with maximum permissible speed when the signals are green throughout the travel path. Traffic free flow time is fixed for a specific network and actual travel time varies with changes in traffic signal timing. Therefore, adjusting the traffic signal timing directly influences the delay experienced by vehicles: T where T MD , T a , T f are the total mean delay, actual travel time and free flow traffic time, respectively. n is the total number of vehicles currently inside the network. Another important perfor-mance metric used for analyzing the performance of the signal control is the current mean speed. Current mean speed or the instantaneous value of speed represents the speed of a vehicle currently traveling inside the network, indicating the road saturation levels. Current mean speed also allows the control center operators understand the reason for reduced delay during non-congested periods and the effect of saturation of road networks. The mean delay and current mean speed of vehicles together give a good indication of the traffic state in the network ( Balaji et al., 2007; Srinivasan et al., 2006; Board, 2000 ) and was used in this work to analyze the improvements achieved in the traffic condition by using the proposed architecture. 4. Simulation setup and platform
The multi-agent system presented in the previous section was tested on simulated real-world scenario and extreme stress scenario in order to effectively evaluate its performance in a large interconnected network. This section describes in detail the simulation environment chosen and the platform used to conduct the tests. 4.1. Traffic network design
The traffic network used to evaluate the performance of the proposed signal control was a section of the central business district in Singapore Fig. 5 . The network was modeled using version 6.0 of PARAMICS traffic simulator. The signal phasing sequence, signal plans, flow information and traffic count data necessary to create the origin-destination matrix for the
PARAMICS software were obtained from the Land transport authority (LTA) of Singapore. The section of network considered for simulation is prone to frequent traffic jams because of the heavy traffic flow in this region. The network constructed is similar to the network used in Srinivasan et al. (2006) , Choy et al. (2003) and details are shown in Table 3 . The network selected is an ideal test bed for the proposed multi-agent signal control as it includes minor roads, as well as major one-way and two-way links with varying number of lanes in each link, and helps in demonstrating the applicability of the proposed signal control for different types of arterial roads. The network has been calibrated for the real-time data for the simulations conducted in Srinivasan et al. (2006) , therefore no re-calibration is required. All the benchmarks and the proposed algorithm have been tested for similar traffic flow patterns and all comparisons are made to the simulated results and not to the actual delay experienced. It would be unfair to compare with real traffic delay as the simulation does not include pedestrian crossing. 4.2. Agent implementation
The agents were implemented as a part of the dynamic linked library files which were used to collect the data from PARAMICS and implement control directives. Various modules of the agent were created as objects, and called in the main program at every time step of the simulation, thereby reducing the necessity to run the decision making module continuously in the background. Each agent uses local data received from the sensors directly connected to the intersection, and the communicated congestion data from the neighboring intersections connected to the out-going links to determine the green time required during the next cycle. The agent estimates the traffic congestion level and attempts to reduce or bring it to a lower congestion state by selection of appropriate signal policy. The default time-step used was 0.5 and data was sampled every ten seconds. 4.3. Benchmarks
It is difficult to obtain a reliable benchmark for estimating the improvements achieved using the proposed traffic signal control. It would be unfair to compare the hybrid intelligent system with fixed signal controllers or controllers developed for isolated intersections as they are developed for simplified scenarios.
Moreover, the results obtained in some of the papers cannot be directly compared as they were tested for different traffic networks, traffic loading, and signal plans ( Balmer et al., 2004;
Jee-Hyong and Hyung, 1999 ). In view of these issues, the network used for testing the proposed signal controller is the same as the one used for the benchmarks in Srinivasan et al. (2006) . The origin-destination (OD) matrix for a specific period of time was designed from the information collected from the road network.
GLIDE ( Keong, 1993 ) (Green link determine) signal controller is the modified version of SCATS (Sydney Cooperative Adaptive
Traffic system) currently used in Singapore for the control and management of road traffic. The signal plans used were derived from the actual signal settings used in Singapore road networks.
GLIDE is a centrally managed signal controller whose decisions are based on the data collected from the loop detectors at each intersection, with the main objective of maintaining the degree of saturation. GLIDE has been simulated to the best possible extent for the same network, and similar simulation scenarios as in
Srinivasan et al. (2006) , which are used as benchmarks for the proposed signal controller. In GLIDE the signal timings are selected according to the fixed time control that can give the best performance for the perceived traffic condition.
Another benchmark used is the HMS (Hierarchical multi-agent system) designed based on hybrid neural network in Srinivasan et al. (2006) and applied to the same network as GLIDE. The HMS signal control is a semi-distributed control system with different levels of hierarchy assigned to agents to determine the required green time.
Semi-distributed nature of the controller provides partial autono-mous decision making capability to the agents, and reduces the communication requirements and data mining operations. 5. Results and discussions
Two types of simulation scenarios were used to compare the performance of the proposed multi-agent based traffic signal control and benchmarks. A six hour simulation scenario with typical morning and afternoon peaks was used to study the control efficiency of the multi-agent signal control when subjected to dynamically varying traffic condition within a short duration of time. The other scenario is a long term simulation with multiple traffic peaks to emulate the infinite horizon problem. This is a highly fictitious scenario used for testing the settling time and the responsiveness of controller when subjected to repetitive stress. 5.1. Two peak scenario
The mean time delay experienced per vehicle for scenario 1 when using different multi-agent architectures is shown in Fig. 6 .
Table 4 shows the mean delay comparison with the benchmark signal control architecture of GLIDE and HMS. It can be seen from
Fig. 6 that the multi-agent system employing type-2 fuzzy decision module with dynamic variation of weight for the flow input performs better than other signal controls. The vehicle actuated signal control system (Adaptive) shows the highest value of delay and performs the worst. The type-1 fuzzy system has a total delay higher than the type-2 fuzzy system without communication because of its inability to handle the uncertainties associated with inputs and the rule base. The design and architecture of multi-agent type-1 fuzzy decision system used were the same as the proposed agent system with type-2 fuzzy decision module. The membership functions for the inputs were derived from Srinivasan et al. (2006) . During low congestion period, the delay experienced by vehicles when using type-2 fuzzy sets based architecture with and without communication capabilities remains the same. However, during peak period, the multi-agent system with communication capabilities perform 45% better than those without communication capabilities. The reason for the improvement can be attributed to the level of cooperation between the agents by the adjustment of the detected flow rate values.

When compared with HMS (Hierarchical Multi-agent Systems) ( Srinivasan et al., 2006 ), type-2 fuzzy controllers with commu-nication produces 20% reduction in total delay during the first peak period, and 28% reduction during the second peak period. A comparison of the number of vehicles released into the network and the corresponding number of vehicles present in the network during each time period of the simulation is shown in Table 5 .It can be seen that the number of vehicles retained in the network when using type-2 fuzzy controller is smaller than HMS, as the traffic at the intersection is cleared faster, thereby reducing vehicle count at the start of the next period. The main control action takes place during the high traffic inflow period where the coordination between agents is of critical importance to avoid queue spill back. Table 6 shows that percentage improvement in the average speed for the low traffic region is of less significance when compared to high traffic region (the values were averaged into various traffic regions based on the input simulation profile used). Traffic controlled by GLIDE for the multiple peak scenario shows active degeneration and saturation. This phenomenon can also be observed in the simulation results of Scenario 2. Table 7 shows the comparison of worst and best results observed during the simulation of the proposed multi-agent architecture. The comparison also shows the standard deviation and confidence interval. It can be seen that the 90% confidence interval value has a maximum value of six seconds which is highly acceptable and indicates the repeatability of the controller. 5.2. Multiple peak scenario
In multiple peak traffic simulation scenario, eight peak periods were simulated for a total period of twenty four hours. This is a hypothetical high stress traffic condition used to validate the stability and response time of the signal control system. Failure of the signal control system to clear the vehicles from the network during any of the peak periods will progressively increase the number of vehicles retained inside the network and can cause saturation of road networks. In this scenario, the type-2 fuzzy system with communication capabilities outperforms the type-1 fuzzy and type-2 fuzzy without communication capabilities and can be seen from Fig. 7 . Comparison with the benchmarks HMS and GLIDE shows very good improvement in the traffic condition, as seen from Table 8 . The type-2 fuzzy based agent system shows around 39% reduction in total delay during the first peak period compared to HMS. The system is also much stable than HMS as the latter begins to destabilize after sixth peak period, and the delay starts to increase considerably because of the deadlocks created in the network. At the end of 24-hour simulation, the fuzzy based system showed almost 66% reductions in delay experienced by vehicles. Simple adaptive system saturates and the delay increases exponentially due to the gridlock caused during the fifth peak period in this simulation setting. The reason for the decrease in delay when using the type-2 fuzzy decision system with commu-nication capabilities compared to other methods was due to the reduction in number of vehicles in the network during each peak period. Table 11 shows the comparison of number of vehicles retained inside the network at various peak periods and the number of vehicles released into the network from the start of the peak period. The number of vehicles released into the network is almost the same for both the simulations and the percentage change in the vehicle count is shown. It is not possible to have exact number of vehicles released into the network for various simulation as it will conflict with the stochastic nature of traffic.
Further, the results shown are the average values of ten simulation runs conducted with different random seeds, therefore all the comparisons are for the average of ten simulation runs.
The reduction in delay when using type-2 fuzzy controller with communication capabilities was due to increased speed per vehicle and efficient coordination achieved because of commu-nication between adjacent intersections. The increase in speed occurs due to higher utilization of road capacity and reduction in the delay experienced by vehicles during first peak period. It is also observed that most of the vehicles from the road network are cleared allowing them to reach their destination quicker. Since the number of vehicles retained in the network was brought down at the end of first peak period, the number of vehicles present in the network during the start of subsequent peak periods reduced, thereby increasing the availability of free roads.
This is evident from Tables 9 and 10 showing improved speed. It can also be seen that using GLIDE, the speed drops to zero from fifth peak cycle as the traffic had saturated and deadlock condition had occurred. This was because of the inability of GLIDE to sustain the high stress created by multiple recurring peaks.
Table 12 shows the comparison of time delay for each two hour of simulation. The standard deviation and the confidence interval are within bounds and are acceptable.
 6. Conclusion
A multi-agent architecture based on type-2 fuzzy decision system was proposed for a traffic signal control application. The optimized green time required for each phase in the signal was calculated based on data collected from road network and the weights calculated for scaling the flow input. Simulation of different traffic scenarios using the proposed multi-agent archi-tecture was shown to alleviate traffic congestion, and reduce total time delay experienced by vehicles to a larger extent as compared to GLIDE and HMS traffic signal controllers.

Even though the multi-agent type-2 fuzzy signal control produced better results than HMS and GLIDE, there are some limitations in the optimization due to the network architecture.
One of the limitations is because of heavy traffic in one way links caused by routing. Obtaining a solution is difficult as the origin-destination matrix is drawn from the original data, and depends on the behavior of drivers. Possible solutions to influence the driver behavior are by using VMS (variable message sign), TTD (travel time display), interaction between vehicles and signals to update cost of using a particular link or by using model free learning methods like reinforcement learning to modify signal timings according to traffic flow pattern based on delayed rewards.

Synchronization of the traffic signals at different intersections by adjusting the offset (starting time of green signal) along a specific direction can further improve the performance of the signal control. Offset can be adjusted off-line using evolutionary methods such as genetic algorithm. However, the challenge is in finding a suitable fitness function to perform the offset adjustment.
