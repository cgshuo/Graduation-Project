Surprisingly little of the work on understanding information seeking and the design of digital libraries has taken much account of the background of the users or the context within which they are working. It has information retrieval. The challenge is arguably greater than this: there is additionally a need to understand how digital libraries (and related information sources) are used and also how such systems fit into people X  X  broader work tasks. Without such an understanding, it is a matter of chance as to whether new systems actually meet the needs of their users or not.
 solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:  X  Integration of digital library infrastructure with systems that support other work tasks, e.g. writing; structuring information; problem diagnosis; annotation. can inform design.  X  Design of digital libraries or digital library components that support particular user needs.  X  Usability studies that account for broader work tasks.
