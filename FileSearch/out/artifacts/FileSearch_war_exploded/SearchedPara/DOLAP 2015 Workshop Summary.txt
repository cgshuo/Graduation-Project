 The ACM DOLAP workshop presents research that bridges data warehousing, On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP), and other large-scale data processing platforms. The pro-gram has four interesting sessions on data warehouse design, database modeling, query processing, and text processing, as well as an invited paper on Big Data Database Design. H.2 [ General ]: [Database Management] Algorithms, Design, Performance, Theory Data Warehousing; OLAP
Data warehousing is considered a mature technology to which almost every major organization has some effort ded-icated. One such effort corresponds to On-Line Analyti-cal Processing (OLAP), which comes to summarizations, cube aggregations, and exploratory queries. However, the establishment of large heterogeneous data repositories, also called  X  X ata Lakes X , and the adoption of cloud computing have triggered the development of a new generation of large-scale data processing platforms (e.g. Hadoop environment). Systems on these platforms have to reconsider the entire foundation of data warehouses (e.g. relational model and database design) to guarantee the required scalability and performance. Furthermore, a large variety of specialized tools has also to be taken into account to build solutions that coexist in this shared environment. In DOLAP 2015, we tackle some of these challenges and observe an increasing variety of data warehouses.
 database community is that of Array Databases. In [6], the authors explore a proposal for augmenting the standard re-lational database language (SQL) with multidimensional ar-ray capabilities (ASQL). In particular, the authors present a comprehensive definition of ASQL with its unifying array and set integration. This proposal should lead to new chal-lenges in conceptual modeling for array data warehouses. Likewise, our invited paper focuses on the impact of the big data wave on database design. Therefore, this paper summa-rizes the challenges of database design in the past, present, and future. The paper in [1] presents an overview of the evo-lution of the data warehouse design given the challenges of big data. These difficulties include the different storage for-mats, data locality (or lack thereof), denormalization, data distribution and partitioning, among others. Finally, the paper defends the idea that database management systems are migrating into polyglot systems compounded by several NoSQL tools that leave the existing modeling tool set (e.g. UML, normalization theory) useless in this context. The au-thor concludes the paper by presenting some open questions and research opportunities.

Session 3 focuses on OLAP query processing. In [12], the authors tackle the problem of finding an efficient join al-gorithm for stream data. Therefore, the authors propose two algorithms, Trie join and Bitrie join, to perform semi-stream similarity join between stream data and disk rela-tional data. Their framework evaluates efficiency and effec-tiveness of the proposal by showing near real-time results. Similarly, the authors in [3] propose an efficient algorithm (roNNJ) to compute the nearest neighbor join with grouping attributes and selection predicates. The proposed algorithm is not impacted by redundant fetches and index false hits since is evaluated as a new physical operator with a similar set of states to those of the traditional Sort Merge Join op-erator (implemented in PostgreSQL). roNNJ computes the results in a single scan of the input relations as the result of a roNNJ query tree that is not dependent on the physical or-ganization of the fact table. Finally, the authors prove that their approach has an upper bound complexity of n log n . In addition to improved join algorithms for speeding up query processing, the decision on the type of hardware deployment to run the analytical workload is crucial to achieve the tar-get performance and cost. In [5], the authors propose the SpotADAPT framework to choose the optimal cloud deploy-ment in systems such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). Their algorithm is based on executing only a sample of the dataset on a subset of the AWS instance types. Then the algorithm will select the best deployment given the provided time and cost models. The algorithm allows the user to select between the fastest or the cheapest deployment by a particular date.
Session 4 presents research on Text Processing. In partic-ular, the increase of semi-structured and unstructured data warehouses has led to multiple proposals involving keyword search processing with the semantic web using OLAP tech-niques. In [2], the authors present GoOLAP, a system devel-oped to identify patterns of analytical tasks in workloads of text databases by leveraging the user X  X  search expectations to provide results. In order to identify these patterns, the proposal provides a supervised classification model (semi-supervised for classification of rare queries) to evaluate the common tasks. The authors in [9] present a visualization tool to maximize recall during keyword searches. The effi-ciency of the tool relies on point and aggregate views that
