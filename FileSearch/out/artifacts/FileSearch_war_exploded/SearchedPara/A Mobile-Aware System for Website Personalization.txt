 An important research challenge in the Web age consists in enhancing the capability of a Web-based information system to tailo r itself to the specific preferences and re-quirements of users. Web personalization can be effectively accomplished by suitably handling knowledge discovered from the analysis of the dynamic nature of user inter-actions together with the specifics of the website [3].
 ured without taking into account the user loca tion. However, the use of portable comput-ing devices capable of wireless networking, also known as mobile computing , requires necessarily to consider different factors addressing the context of use, i.e. the user, the information content, the mobile device, and the network.
 complex, while new ones arise. Indeed, besides website structure and content and user profiles, additional wireless-aware information might be considered, such as user mo-bility, device features (e.g. interface capab ilities, processi ng power, type of connectiv-ity) and network features (e.g. bandwidth, QoS level, localization capabilities, security). Moreover, the needs of a mobile user should als o take his/her location into account, i.e. content delivery should be filtered b y the user X  X  geographical position.
 stage, if compared with the r esults obtained by works on traditional web personaliza-tion [3,5]. A precise statement for the webs ite personalization problem is given in [1], although information on device, network and user location is marginally, or not at all, considered. A mobile agent b ased architecture, which combines existing techniques in a component-based fashion, is proposed in [6]. In [2] the focus is on the design of a decision system for processing and managin g the information delivery to the user. The set of parameters chosen to provide adaptive mobile services is mostly complete, and includes device, network and user position. However, decisions are based on simple policies of parameter setting, whereas no personalization action is defined. Contribution. In this paper we extend a previously proposed work on supporting users for personalized navigation of websites [4]. That work presents an approach that pro-vides a user with a non-invasive, personalized view of any page visited in the website currently accessed. This is accomplished by mainly exploiting knowledge discovered both from user preferences and usage and content correlations among pages. A clus-tering process guides the identification of users with similar navigational preferences, according to their browsing histories. For any active user , the membership cluster is selected to extend the set of pages of interest to those of the users in the same cluster. Usage and content correlations are discovered from these pages, in order to provide a ranked list of interesting suggestions for the active user.
 implemented system can also be utilized thr ough mobile devices. Our concern is to pro-vide personalization w.r.t. any active context of use , which is represented by the active user, at a particular location, while visiting a particular site page by means of a mo-bile device through wireless communication. The underlying idea lies substantially on two reasons. Firstly, user location information may act as a discriminatory factor in de-tecting the user navigational interests. Indeed, pages containing information on certain location-sensitive topics (e.g. restaurants, hotels, etc.) should be relevant specifically to users whose geographical position is close to the target location. Therefore, interests for any active user should be discovered accordi ngly to a particular location, and in a col-laborative filtering fashion, that is by expl oiting the profiles of a neighborhood of users whose interests and location are similar to those of the active user. Secondly, device and network information might be exploited to serve for application adaptability. This is strictly related to the design of the personalization action, which in our setting has the form of a menu bar placed on top of the pa ge and organized by s ections containing page recommendations. In this section we give the statement for the problem of web page recommendation for users of mobile devices. Given a website W , we assume the following information is available:  X  Aset P of pages in W . Any page p is represented by its URL and is coupled with  X  Aset U of users of W .Anyuser u in U is either a past or a current visitor of pages in  X  Aset L of strings denoting geographical locations (e.g. province, city, street names).  X  Aset S of user sessions. Any session s  X  X  is a tuple u i ,l j ,P,t ,where u i  X  X  is  X  An active context u a ,l a ,p a ,where u a , l a and p a denote the active user, the active  X  Aset D of mobile devices. Today typical categories of mobile devices include  X  Aset N of wireless networks, such as WPANs (e.g. Bluetooth), WLANs (e.g. to p and a set of users related to u , w.r.t. location l . More precisely, starting from p ,we detect the set U p/l of users who have visited p when located at l , and then the set P p/l of pages visited by users in U p/l . Dually, starting from u , we select the set P u of pages visited by u , and then the set U u/l of users who have visited pages in P u when located at l . Note that U p/l can be recognized by the set S p  X  X  l of sessions involving p  X  X  users navigating from location l ; analogously, U u/l can be recognized by the set S u  X  X  l of sessions involving u  X  X  navigations at location l .
 main stages: i) location-based detection of user preferences, ii) identification of users with similar preferences, iii) discovery of usage and content correlations between pages, and iv) computation and ranking of interesting recommendations for the active user. The ultimate objective is to provide any user of a target website with a personalized access that fulfills his/her navigational preferences in a particular context of use. Location-Based Detection of User Preferences. The preference of a user for a given page can be assessed by suitably weighting the visit frequency of the user during the relative history of accesses to the site. However, for a mobile user, preferences should be measured contextually to a given geographical location. Let u  X  X  beauser, l  X  X  be a location, and p  X  X  be a page. The degree of preference of u for p ,when u  X  X  position is l , is provided by the preference function : and d i = t c  X  t i is the timestamp difference between the current session and s i . with UL the set of pairs { u/l | u  X  X  X  l  X  X } and with ULP the ( |UL| X |P| ) preference matrix storing the normalized degrees of preference of all pairs user/location u /l j  X  X L for all pages p k  X  X  : Identification of Users with Similar Preferences. The second stage consists in identi-fying users showing similar navigational p references. We accomplish this objective by performing a clustering task that accepts as input the following data: the active user u a , at location l a , with the set U u a /l a of related users, and the active page p a with the set P a /l a of related pages. As we have discussed previously, the sets are selected w.r.t. the active context, i.e. the triple u a ,l a ,p a . Starting from these sets, a matrix called active preference matrix ULP a is built to store the normalized degrees of preference of all users in U u a /l a for all pages in P p a /l a .
 active user in preference clusters, where the notion of homogeneity among users is referred to the preference values stored in the active preference matrix. We consider the set of pages visited by the users assigned to the same cluster of the active user, the active preference cluster C a . We denote with P C a this set of pages. The next step is to discover among pages in P C a those correlations that lie behind usage and content patterns. We refer to [4] for the adopted clustering technique and the measures exploited to discover usage and content similarities from the set P C a .
 Computing and Ranking Page Recommendations. We define the page recommendation function ( PR ) as a combination of the user preference function and the page similarity measures. Given the active user u a at location l a and the active page p a , recommending apage p  X  X  C a to u a w.r.t. l a and p a is assessed by the page recommendation function: where  X   X  [0 .. 1] weights the user preferences w.r.t. page similarities.
 Moreover, f ( p, u a ,l a ,p a )=  X   X  pref ( u a ,l a ,p a )+(1  X   X  )  X  pref ( u a ,p a ) ,where  X   X  [0 .. 1] measures the preference of user u a for the page p when the current location is l a and the current page is p a ,and g ( p, p a )=  X   X  sim U ( p, p a )+(1  X   X  )  X  sim C ( p, p a ) measures the similarity of the two pages p and p a ,where  X   X  [0 .. 1] weights usage similarity ( sim U ) w.r.t. content similarity ( sim U ).
 during the current session, which do not provide any benefit in terms of navigation support. The recommendation of a page p for the active user u a at location l a , w.r.t. the active page p a ,isrankedbythe page recommendation ranking function: where freq ( u a ,p ) | t c denotes the number of times page p has been visited in the current session by u a ,and n u a | t c is the total number of accesses of u a in the current session. The original contents of any visited page should be visualized in understandable forms so that the user is able to easily browse, and the delivery of recommendations should be non-invasive w.r.t. the preexisting structure of the page. For this purpose, we propose a navigational menu bar as a light and intuitive personalization interface.
 additional layer, and is designed to contai n links to pages to be recommended according to the page recommendation function. More precisely, the navigational bar is designed with BS ( bar size ) sections, or menus, each havi ng maximum length equal to ML .Both parameters BS and ML can be estimated as functions of de vice and network features. For this purpose, we devise a simple model based on a decision tree, where each internal node denotes a test on a feature, each branch re presents an outcome of the test, and leaf nodes represent value settings for BS and ML . For instance: if screen  X   X 240  X  320 X  and scrolling =  X  X es X  and memory  X   X 32 MB X  then BS :=  X 3 X  and ML :=  X 5 X  .
 is the preference cluster of the active user). The mandatory menu is obviously the one containing links to the ranked recommended pages . Other two important menus are favorite pages and similar pages , that is the menus containing links to pages ranked, respectively, by decreasing degree of user pre ference and page usage/content similarity. Possibly, the remaining BS  X  3 are devoted to the recommended pages that have the highest degree of recommendation: for each of these pages, say p , the corresponding menu lists the first ML pages in P C a linked by p , ordered by degree of recommendation. main module is the personalization engine (Fig. 1(a)), which analyzes information about the user behavior from and yields the page recommendations used to build the navigational bar. 3.1 Website Personalization: An Application Scenario We now present an application scenario that allows us to preliminarily shed light on the behavior of the system when tested against a complex website. For complex website, we intend here a website containing several hundreds of pages, with a complex structure of links among pages, and exhibiting several presentation and content features. Viewed in this respect, we chose the site PagineGialle (www.paginegialle.it), an Italian web direc-tory containing information on national companies providing services or products, such as tourism, advertising and services for business, public authorities and communities. As a test experiment, we considered the follo wing scenario. The active user is located near Rimini, a nice residential holiday centre in the Eastern coast of Italy. The user is mainly interested in accommodation possibilities, but he/she would also like to know any information about travel services. Fig. 1(b) shows a snapshot of a page excerpt from PagineGialle . The page was displayed on a web browser running on Compaq Pocket PC iPAQ H3800, and was adapted with a navigational bar having three sections (i.e. BS was set to 3 ), each with a length ( ML ) equal to 3 . Parameters  X  ,  X  and  X  were set to 0 . 5 . havior of the system. Indeed, the favorite pages section was related to a cluster of users interested in travel and tourist services not only in Rimini but also in its province (e.g. Riccione). The similar pages section pulled together pages similar by content, such as pages concerning several choices of accommodation in Rimini. Indeed, the expanded menu of recommended pages picked items from the first two menus: in particular, the recommendations  X  X lberghi a Misano Adriatico X  and  X  X otel Carolin X  refer to hotels in the close neighborhood of Rimini, whereas  X  X oleggio Camper, Caravan, Minibus X  points to a page containing information about car rentals in Rimini. We have proposed a mobile-aware approach to website personalization, which aims at providing any user with a personalized acces s according to a specific context of use, namely the user preferences, the user physical location, information on page content and usage, the device and network features . This approach has been effectively used to develop a lightweight system for computing page recommendations w.r.t. an active context of use. The system has been tested on some significant websites: in this paper, we have presented an interesting application scenario providing encouraging results. eral tests on large websites. In particular, we shall deeply investigate the behavior of the system for different contexts of use, and the role of location in enhancing the user preferences. Finally, a special study will be devoted to find out how much application adaptability can be affected by the mobile device, the network, and the page functions.
