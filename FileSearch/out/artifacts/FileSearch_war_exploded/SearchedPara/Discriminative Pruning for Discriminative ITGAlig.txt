 In version transduction grammar (I TG) (Wu, 1997) is an adaptation of SCFG to bilingual parsing. It does synchronous parsing of two languages with phrasal and word -level alignment as by -product. For this reason ITG has gained more and more attention recently in the word alignment comm u-nity (Zhang and Gildea , 2005 ; Cherr y and Lin , 200 6 ; Haghig hi et al. , 200 9 ) .
 A major obstacle in ITG alignment is speed. The original (unsupervised ) ITG algorithm has complexity of O(n 6 ). When extended to supe r-vised/discriminative framework, ITG runs even more slowly. Therefore all attempts to ITG alignment come with some pruning method. For example, Haghighi et al. (2009) do pruning b ased on the probabilities of links from a simpler alignment model (viz. HMM); Zhang and Gildea (2005 ) propose Tic -t ac -t oe pruning, which is based on the Model 1 probabilities of word pairs inside and outside a pair of spans.

A s a ll the principles behind these techniques have certain contribution in making good prun ing decision, it is tempting t o incorporate all these fea tures in ITG pruning. In this paper, w e pr o-pose a novel discriminative pruning framework for d iscriminative ITG . The pruning model uses no more training data than the discriminative ITG parser itself, and it uses a l og -linear model to i n-tegrate all features that help identify the correct span pair (like Model 1 probability and HMM posterior). On top of the discriminative pruning method, we also propose a discriminative ITG alignment system using hierarchical phrase pa irs . 
In the following, some basic details on the ITG formalism and ITG parsing are first reviewed (Sections 2 and 3 ), followed by the definit ion of pruning in ITG (Section 4 ) . The  X  Discriminative Pruning for Discriminative ITG  X  model (DPDI) and our discriminative ITG (DITG) parser s will be elaborated in Sections 5 and 6 respectively. The merits of DPDI and DITG are illustrated with the experiments described in Section 7 . The simplest formulation of ITG contains three types of rules: terminal unary rules  X   X   X  /  X  , where  X  and  X  represent words (possibly a null word,  X  ) in the English and foreign language respectively, and the binary rules  X   X   X  ,  X  and  X   X   X  ,  X  , which refer to that the component English and foreign phrases are combined in the same and inverted order respectively.

From the viewpoint of word alignment, the terminal unary rules provide the links of word pairs, whereas the binary rules repre sent the reo r-dering factor. One of the merits of ITG is that it is less biased towards short -distance reordering.
Such a formulation has two drawbacks . First of all, it imposes a 1 -to -1 constraint in word alig n-ment. That is, a word is not allowed to align to more than one word. This is a strong limitation as no idiom or multi -word expression is allowed to align to a single word on the other side. In fact there have been various attempts in relaxing the 1 -to -1 co nstraint . Both ITG alignment ap proaches with and without this constraint will be elaborated in Section 6 .

Secondly, the simple ITG leads to redundancy if word alignment is the sole purpose of applying ITG. For instan ce, there are two parses for three consecutive word pairs, viz. [  X  /  X   X  [  X  /  X   X   X  / dundancy is fixed by adopting ITG normal form . In fact, normal form is the very first key to spee d-ing up ITG. The ITG normal form grammar as used in this paper is described in Appendix A . Based on the rules in normal form, ITG word alignment is done in a similar way to chart par s-ing (Wu, 1997) . The base step applies all relevant terminal unary rules to establish the links of word pairs. The word pairs are then combined into span pairs in all possible ways. Larger and larger span pairs are recu rsively built until the sentence pair is built. 
Figure 1 (a) shows one possible derivation for a toy example sentence pair with three words i n each sentence. Each node (rectangle) represents a pair , marked with certain phrase category, of fo r-eign span (F -s pan) and English span (E -span) (the upper half of the rectangle) and the ass o-ciated alignment hypothesis (the lower half). Each graph like Figure 1(a) shows only one der i-vation and also only one alignment hypothesis. 
The various derivations in ITG parsing can be compactly represented in hypergraph ( Klei n and Manning , 2001) like Figure 1( b). Each hypernode (rectangle) comprises both a span pair (upper half) and the list of possible alignment hypotheses (lower half) for that span pair . The hyperedges show how larger span pairs are derived from smaller span pair s . Not e that a hypernode may have more than one alignment hypothesis, sin ce a hypernode may be derived through more than one hyperedge (e.g. the topmost hypernode i n Figure 1(b)). Due to the use of normal form, the hyp o-thes e s of a span pair are different from each other. The ITG parsing framework has three levels of pruning: 1) T o discard some unpromising span pairs; 2) T o discard some unpromising F -spans 3) T o discard some unpromising alignment 
The second type of pruning (used in Zhang et . al. (2008)) is very radical as it implies discarding too many span pairs. I t is empirically found to be highly harmful to alignment performance and therefore not adopted in this paper . 
T he third type of pruning is equivalent to m i-nimizing the beam size of alignment hypotheses in each hypernode. It is found to be well handled by the K -Best parsing method in Huang and Chi ang (2005). That is, during the bottom -up construction of the span pair repertoire, each span pair keeps only the best alignment hypothesis. Once the complete parse tree is built, the k -best list of the topmost span is obtained by minimally expanding the list of alignment hypotheses of minimal number of span pairs.

The first type of pruning is equivalent to m i-nimizing the number of hypernodes in a hype r-graph. T he task of ITG pruning is defined in this paper as the first type of pruning; i.e. the search for , given an F -span, the minimal number of E -spans which are the most likely counterpart of that F -span. 1 The pruning method should mai n-tain a balance between efficiency (run as quickly as possible) and performa nce (keep as many co r-rect span pair s as possible). 
A na X ve approach is that the required pruning method outputs a score given a span pair. This score is used to rank all E -spans for a particular F -span, and the score of the correct E -span should be in gen eral higher than most of the i n-correct ones. DPDI, the discriminative pruning model pr o-posed in this paper, assigns score to a span pair  X  ,  X  as probability from a log -linear model: where each  X   X  (  X  ,  X  ) is some feature about the span pair, and each  X  is the weight of the corre s-ponding feature. There are three major questions to this model: 1) How to acquire training samples? (Section 2) How to train the parameters  X  ? (Section 5.2 ) 3) W hat are the features? ( Section 5.3 ) 5.1 T raining Samples Discriminative approaches to word alignment use manually annotat ed alignment for sentence pair s . Discriminative pruning, however, handles not only a sentence pair but every possible span pair. The required training samples consist of various F -spans and their corresponding E -spans.

Rather than recruiting annotators for marking span pairs, we modify the parsing algorithm in Section 3 so as to produce span pair annotation out of sentence -level annotation . In the base step, only the word pairs listed in sentence -level ann o-tation are inserted in the hypergraph, and the r e-cursive step s are just the same as usual. 
If the sentence -level annotation satisfies the alignment constraints of ITG, then each F -span wi ll have only one E -span in the parse tree. Ho w-ever, in reality there are often the cases where a foreign word aligns to more than one English word. In such cases the F -span cov ering that fo r-eign word has more than one co rresponding E -spans. Consider the ex ample in Figure 2 , where the golden links in the alignment annotation are  X  1 aligns to both the English words  X  1 and  X  2 . T herefore the F -span  X  1 ,  X  1 aligns to the E -span  X  1 ,  X  1 in one hypernode and to the E -span  X  2 ,  X  2 in another hypernode. When such situ a-tion happens, we calculate the product of the i n-side and outside probability of each alignment hypothesis of the span pair , based on the prob a-bilities of the links from some s impler alignment model 2 . T he E -span with the most probab le hyp o-thesis is selected as the alignment of the F -span. 
It should be noted that this automatic span pair annotation may violate some of the links in the original sentence -level alignment annotation. We have already seen how the 1 -to -1 constraint in ITG leads to the violation. Another situation is the  X  inside -out  X  alignment pattern ( c.f. Figure 3 ) . The ITG reordering constraint cannot be satisfied unless o n e of the links in this pattern is removed. Figure 3 : An example of inside -out alignment
The training samples thus obtained are positive train ing samples. If we apply some classifier for parameter training, then negative samples are also needed. Fortunately, our parameter training does not rely on any negati ve samples. 5.2 MERT for Prunin g Parameter training of DPDI is based on Min i-mum Error Rate Training (MERT) (Och, 200 3 ) , a widely used method in SMT . MERT for SMT estimates model parameters with the objective of minimizing certain measure of translation errors (or maximizing certain performance measure of translation quality) for a development corpus . Given an SMT system which produces , with model parameters  X  1  X  , the K -best candidate tran s-error measure  X  (  X   X  ,  X   X  ,  X  ) of a particular candidate  X   X  ,  X  with respect to the reference translation  X   X  , the optimal parameter values will be: 
D PDI applies the same equation for parameter tuning, with different interpretation of the co m-ponents in the equation. I nstead of a development corpus with reference translations, we have a co l-lection of training samples, each of which is a pair of F -span (  X   X  ) and its corresponding E -span (  X  ) . These samples are acquired from some m a-nually aligned dataset by the method elaborated in Section 5.1 . The ITG parser outputs for each f s a K -best list of E -spans  X   X   X  ;  X  1  X  based on the current parameter values  X  1  X  . 
The error function is based on the presence and the rank of the correct E -span in the K -best list:  X   X   X  ,  X   X   X  ;  X  1  X  = w here  X   X   X   X   X   X  is the (0 -based) rank of the co r-rect E -span  X   X  in the K -best list  X   X   X  ;  X  1  X  . If fined to be  X   X   X   X   X   X   X  , which is set as -100000 in our experiments. The rationale underlying this error function is to keep as many correct E -spans as possible in the K -best lists of E -spans, and push the correct E -spans upward as much as possible in the K -best lists.

This new error measure leads to a change in details of the training algorithm. In MERT for SMT, the interval boundaries at which the pe r-formance or error measure changes are defined by the upper envelope (illustrated by the dash line in Figure 4 (a)), since the performance/error measure depends on the best candidate transl a-tion. In MERT for DPDI, however, the error measure depends on the correct E -span rather than the E -span leading to the highest system score. Thus the interval boundaries are the inte r-secti ons between the correct E -span and all other candidate E -spans (as shown in Figure 4 (b)). Th e rank of the correct E -span in each interval can then be figured out as shown in Figure 4 (c). F i-nally, the error measure in each interval can be calculated by Equation ( 2 ) (as show n in Figure 4 (d)) . All other steps in MERT for DPDI are the same as that for SMT.
 5.3 Features The features used in DPDI are divided into three categories: 1) Model 1 -based probabilities. Zhang and Gi l-2) Heuristics. There are four features in this ca t-3) HMM -b ased p robabilities. Haghighi et al. The discriminative ITG alignment can be co n-ceived as a two -staged process. In the first stage DPDI selects good span pairs. In the second stage good alignment hypotheses are assigned to the span pairs selected by DP DI. Two discrimina tive ITG (DITG) models are investigated. One is word -to -word DITG (henceforth W -DITG), which observes the 1 -to -1 constraint on alig n-ment. Another is DITG with hierarchical phrase pairs (henceforth HP -DITG), which relaxes the 1 -to -1 constraint by adopting hierarchical phrase pairs in Chiang (2007). 
Each model select s the b est alignmen t hyp o-theses of each span pair, given a set of features. The contributions of these features are integrated through a log linear model ( similar to Liu et al. , 2005; Moore, 2005) like Equation ( 1 ) . The di s-criminative training of the feature weights is again MERT ( Och , 200 3 ) . The MERT module for DITG takes alignment F -score of a sentence pair as the performance measure. Given an input s entence pair and the reference annotated alig n-ment, MERT aims to maximize the F -score of DITG -produced alignment. Like SMT (and u n-like DPDI), it is the upper envelope which d e-fines the intervals where the performance mea s-ure changes. 6.1 Word -to -word DITG T he following features about alignment link are used in W -DITG : 1) W ord pair translation probabilities trained 2) Conditional link probability (Moore, 2005) . 3) Association score rank features (Moore et 4) Distortion features: counts of inversion 5) Difference between the relative positions 6) Boolean features like whether a word in 6.2 DITG with Hierarchical Phrase Pairs The 1 -to -1 assumption in ITG is a serious limit a-tion as in reality there are always segmentation or tok enization errors as well as idiomatic expre s-sions. Wu (1997) propose s a bilingual segment a-tion grammar extending the terminal rules by in cluding phrase pairs . Cherry and Lin (2007) incorporate phrase pairs in phrase -base d SMT into ITG, and Haghighi et al. (2009) introduce Block ITG (BITG) , which adds 1 -to -many or many -to -1 terminal unary rules. 
It is interesting to see if DPDI can benefit the parsing of a more realistic ITG. HP -DITG e x-tend s Cherry and Lin  X  s approach by not only e m-ploying simple phrase pai rs but also hierar chical phrase pairs (Chiang, 2007) . The grammar is enriched with rules of the format:  X   X   X   X  /  X  where  X   X  and  X   X  refer to the English and foreign side of the i -th (simple/ hierarchical ) phrase pair respectively.

As example, if there is a simple phrase pair  X  formed into the ITG rule  X  "  X   X  X  X  " . During parsing, each span pair does not only examine all possible combinations of sub -span pairs using binary rules, but also checks if the yield of that span pair is exactly the same as that phrase pair. If so, then the alignment links within the phrase pair (which are obtained in standard phrase pair extraction procedure) are taken as an alternative alignment hypothesis of that span pair. 
For a hierarchical phrase pair like  X  the ITG rule  X  parsing, each span pair checks if it contains the lexical anchors "of " and "  X  " , and if the remai n-ing words in its yield can form two sub -span pairs which fit the reordering constraint among  X  1 and  X  2 . ( Note that span pairs of any category in the ITG normal form grammar can substitute for  X  1 or  X  2 . ) If both conditions hold, then the span pair is assigned an alignment hypothesis which combines the alignment links among the lexical anchors (  X   X   X   X   X   X  /  X  ) and those links among the sub -span pairs. 
HP -ITG acquires the rules from HMM -based word -aligned corpus using standard phrase pair extraction as stated in Chiang (2007). The rule pro babilities and lexical weights in both English -to -foreign and foreign -to -English directions are estimated and taken as features , in addition to those features in W -DITG, in the discriminative model of alignment hypothesis selection . DPDI is eva luated against the baselines of Tic -tac -t oe (TTT) pruning (Zhan g and Gildea, 2005) and Dynamic Program (DP) pruning (Haghighi et al. , 2009; DeN ero et al. , 2009) with respect to Chinese -to -English alignment and t ranslation . Based on DPDI, HP -DITG is evaluated against the alignment systems GIZA++ and BITG. 7.1 Evaluation Criteria Four evaluation criteria are used in addition to the time spent on ITG parsing . We will first ev a-luate pruning regarding the pruning decisions themselves. That is, the first evaluation metric, pruning error rate (henceforth PER), measures how many correct E -spans are discarded. The major drawback of PER is that not all decisions in pruning would impact on alignmen t quality, since certain F -spans are of little use to the entire ITG parse tree. 
An alternative criterion is the upper bound on alignment F -score , which essentially measures how m any links in annotated alignment can be kept in ITG parse . The calculation o f F -score u p-per bound is done in a bottom -up way like ITG parsing. A ll leaf hypernodes which contain a co r-rect link are assigned a score ( known as hit) of 1. The hit of a non -leaf hypernode is based on the sum of hits of its daughter hypernodes. The ma x-ima l sum among all hyperedges of a hypernode is as signed to that hypernode. Formally,  X   X   X   X   X  ,  X  =  X   X   X   X   X   X  ,  X  = 1  X   X   X  ,  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  = 0 ;  X   X   X   X   X  = 0 where  X  ,  X  ,  X  are variables fo r the categories in ITG grammar, and  X  comprises the golden links in annotated alignment.  X   X  ,  X   X  ,  X   X  are defined in Appendix A.

Figure 6 illustrates the calc ulation of the hit score for the example in Sec tion 5.1 / Figure 2 . The upper bound of recall is the hit score divided by the total number of golde n links. The upper bound of precision, which should be defined as the hit score divided by the number of links pr o-duced by the system, is almost always 1.0 in practice. The upper bound of alignment F -score can thus be calculated as well.

Finally, we also do end -to -end evaluation u s-ing both F -score in alignment and Bleu score in translation. We use our implementation of hiera r-chical phrase -based SMT (Chiang, 2007), with standard features, for the SMT experiments. 7.2 Experiment Data Both discriminative pruning and alignment need training data and test data. We use the manually aligned Chinese -English dataset as used in Ha g-highi et al. (2009). The 491 sentence pairs in this dataset are adapted to our own Chinese word segmentation standard. 250 sentence pairs are used as training data and the other 241 are test data. The corresponding numbers of F -spans in training and test data are 4590 and 3951 respe c-tively. 
In SMT e xperiments, the bilingual training d a-taset is the NIST training set excluding the Hong Kong Law and Hong Kong Hansard , and our 5 -gram language mod el is trained from the Xinhua section of the Gigaword corpus. The NIST  X  03 test set is used as our development corpus and the NIST  X  05 and NIST X  08 test sets are our test sets. 7.3 Small -scale Evaluation The first set of experiments evaluates the perfo r-mance of the three pruning methods using the small 241 -sentence set. Each prunin g method is plugged in both W -DITG and HP -DITG. IBM Model 1 and HMM alignment model are re -implemented as they are required by the three ITG pruning met hods. T he results for W -DITG are listed in Table 1 . T ests 1 and 2 show that with the same beam size (i.e. number of E -spans per F -span), although DPDI spends a bit more time (due to the more complicated model), DPDI makes far less inco r-rect pruning decisions than the T TT . In terms of F -score upper bound, DPDI is 1 percent higher. DPDI achieves even large r improvement in a c-tual F -score.

To enable T TT achieving similar F -score or F -score upper bound, the beam size has to be doubled and the time cost is more than twice the original ( c .f . Tests 1 and 3 in Table 1 ) .
The DP pruning in Haghighi et.al. (2009) pe r-forms much poorer than the other two pruning methods. In fac t, we fail to enable DP achieve the same F -score upper bound as the other two m e-thods before DP leads to intolerable memory consumption. This may be due to the use of di f-ferent HMM model implemen tations between our work and Haghighi et.al. (2009). 
Table 2 l ists the results for HP -DITG. Roughly the same observation as in W -DITG can be made. In addition to the superiority of DPDI, it can also be noted that HP -DITG achieves much higher F -score and F -score upper bound. This shows that hierarchical phrase is a powerful tool in rectif y-ing the 1 -to -1 constraint in ITG.

Note also that while T TT in Test 3 g ets roug h-ly the same F -score upper bound as DPDI in Test 1, the corresponding F -score is slightly wor se. A possible explanation is that better pruning not only speeds up the parsing/alignment process but also guides the search process to focus on the most promising region of the search space. 7.4 Large -scale E nd -to -End Experiment

HP -DITG using DPDI achieves the best Bleu score with acceptable time cost. Table 4 co m-pares HP -DITG to HMM (Vogel, et al., 1996), GIZA++ ( Och and Ney , 200 0 ) and BITG (Ha g-hig hi et al. , 2009). It show s that HP -DITG (with DPDI ) is better than the three base lines both in alignment F -score and Bleu score. Note that the Bleu score difference s between HP -DITG and the three baselines are statistically si gnificant (Koehn, 2004) .
 An explanation of the better performance by HP -DITG is the better phrase pair extraction due to DPDI . On the one hand, a good phrase pair often fails to be extracted due to a link inconsi s-tent with the pair. On the other hand, ITG p ru n-ing can be considered as phrase pair select ion , and good ITG pruning like DPDI guides the su b-sequent ITG alignment process so that less links inconsistent to good phrase pairs are produced . This also explains (in Tables 2 and 3) why DPDI with beam size 10 leads to higher Bleu than TTT with beam size 20, even though both pruning m e-thods lead to roughly the same alignment F -score. This paper reviews word alignment through ITG parsing, and clarifies the problem of ITG pruning. A discriminative pruning model and two discr i-minative ITG alignments systems are proposed. The pruning model is shown to be superior to all existing ITG pruning methods , and the HP -DITG alignment system is shown to improve state -of -the -art alignment and translation quality. 
The current DPDI model em ploys a very l i-mited set of features. Many features are related only to probabilities of word pairs. As the success of HP -DITG illustrates the merit of hierarchical phrase pair , in future we should investigate more features on the relationship between span pair and hierarchical phrase pair .

Tab le 5 lis ts the ITG rules in normal form as used in this paper, which extend the normal form in Wu (1997) so as to handle the case of alig n-ment to null.
In these rules,  X  is the Start symbol;  X  is the category for concatenating combination whereas for inverted combination. Rules (2) and (3) are inherited from Wu (1997). Rules (4) divide the terminal category  X  into subcategories. Rule schema (6) subsumes all terminal unary rules for some English word  X  and foreign word  X  , and rule schemas (7) ar e unary rules for alignment to null. Rules (8) ensure all words linked to null are combined in left branching manner, while rules (9) ensure those words linked to null combine with some following, rather than preceding, word pair. (Note: Accordingly, all s entences must be ended by a special token  X   X   X  , otherwise the last word ( s ) of a sentence cannot be linked to null. ) If there are both English and foreign words linked to null, rule (5) ensures that those English words linked to null precede those foreign words linked to null.
