 Finding experts in question answering platforms has impor-tant applications, such as question routing or identification of best answers. Addressing the problem of ranking users with respect to their expertise, we propose Competition-Based Expertise Networks (CBEN), a novel community ex-pertise network structure based on the principle of compe-tition among the answerers of a question. We evaluate our approach on a very large dataset from Yahoo! Answers us-ing a variety of centrality measures. We show that it outper-forms state-of-the-art network structures and, unlike previ-ous methods, is able to consistly outperform simple metrics like best answer count. We also analyse question answer-ing forums in Yahoo! Answers, and show that they can be characterised by factual or subjective information seeking behavior, social discussions and the conducting of polls or surveys. We find that the ability to identify experts greatly depends on the type of forum, which is directly reflected in the structural properties of the expertise networks. H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Selection process expert finding, community question answering, competition-based expertise network, knowledge sharing
Search engines are not fully capable of answering complex information needs that require deep semantic understand- X  ing or high coverage of human knowledge and experience. Community Question Answering (CQA) portals (e.g., Ya-hoo! Answers, Stack Overflow), in which people can use natural language instead of keywords to ask questions, have emerged in response to these limitations. Although such portals provide a number of feedback mechanisms, these mechanisms are open to abuse and do not provide auto-matic ways to identify experts or high-quality answers. For this reason, ranking users with respect to their expertise is needed for applications such as question routing [17], best answer prediction, and for improving reward mechanisms.
Expert Finding , identifying knowledgeable people on a given topic, has been an active research area even before it was introduced as a task in Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) in 2005 [10]. In addition to Information Retrieval approaches, graph-based methods have been used to find experts by identifying the most central actors in expertise networks , under the assumption that graph centrality is cor-related with expertise [16]. Usually, the networks are built from the links between askers and answerers of a question, or between askers and best answerers. These networks ig-nore the information encoded in the inherent competition among the answers of a question to be selected as the best answer. We propose the Competition-Based Expertise Net-work (CBEN), a novel structure that builds expertise net-works by creating ties between the best answerer and the other answerers they have  X  X eaten X . Combined with graph centrality metrics, CBEN provides a natural way to identify experts.

We evaluate our approach on a large dataset from Ya-hoo! Answers, using a variety of centrality measures, and show not only that it outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based techniques but, unlike previous approaches [5, 16], it consistently outperforms answer count and best answer count. Additionally, we show that in certain cases our ap-proach outperforms personal best answer ratio, which has been considered an upper bound on expert prediction accu-racy. We also analyse different types of Q&amp;A forums and show that the ability to identify experts greatly depends on the type of forum, which is directly reflected in the struc-tural properties of the expertise networks.
Early work in expert finding used Information Retrieval methods to model the relevance of candidate users to a given topic. In Profile-Based Methods , each candidate is repre-sented by a textual profile, which are ranked with respect to an expertise query [9], while in Document-Based Methods relevant documents for the query are first retrieved, and can-didates are then ranked based on the co-occurrence of topic and candidate mentions in the retrieved documents [3].
In forums with a narrow topical focus, such as Yahoo! An-swers leaf-level categories, all users can be assumed relevant to the topic, and rather than considering IR approaches, in-teractions between askers and answerers can be used to find experts. Interaction networks involving question-answering activity, or expertise networks [1], have been studied in the past [15, 13], and several of their structural properties, such as the disassortativity of the expertise level, have been high-lighted [1, 7]. Under the assumption that the most central actors correspond to the most expert users, standard central-ity measures, such as PageRank and HITS [16], and custom centrality metrics, like ExpertiseRank [16, 11], have been employed to detect expert users. None of these approaches performed better than simpler metrics such as indegree or best answers count [5] and, to date, the best answer ratio of the replier has been found to be the best predictor of best answerer, and it is considered as an upper bound on the prediction accuracy [8].

Other work has explored machine learning approaches [6], including work that is most similar to ours [14], which pro-posed a competition-based approach to expertise ranking, training an SVM based on the best answer competition be-tween users. Our work differs in that they only use local information, while we exploit global information by build-ing a social network.
Yahoo! Answers is a general purpose community question answering portal. It includes a hierarchy of categories, with 26 predefined Top-Level Categories (TLC), such as Sports or Family, and a continually growing number of Leaf-Level Categories (LLC): over 1,300 at the time of this study. Ya-hoo! Answers has a strict question-and-answer format, with questions submitted as short statements, with an optional detailed description, and an obligatory associated category. The asker can select the best answer (the most common fea-ture across all CQA platforms); if no best answer is selected by the asker, the community can vote to determine it. Next, we analyze the types of Q&amp;A forums on Yahoo! Answers, studying a large data sample from 2011, containing more than 20 million questions and 87 million answers.
User intent in asking questions can vary widely. Basic classifications partition questions into informational , if they seek facts or advice, and conversational , if they are intended to stimulate a discussion [12]. In practice, every forum cat-egory has some mix of requests for factual information, ad-vice seeking and social conversation or discussion. Adamic et al. [2] used k -means to cluster Yahoo! Answers leaf level cat-egories, using features such as the average number of replies to a question and the average number of characters in a re-ply, and identified three different category types: discussion forums, advice-support seeking and factual answer seeking.
Since one of our goals is to test the performance of expert finding across different forum types, we replicated the ex-periment of Adamic et al. , and included additional activity-based features: average character count in questions, aver-age character count in the asker feedback, the proportion of questions with contradictory answer ratings (i.e. with both  X  X humbs up X  and  X  X humbs down X  feedback), and the average magnitude of the rating gap for questions with contradictory answer ratings. We found that the optimal number of clus-ters is 4 for the extended feature set. For each leaf-level cat-egory, we conducted a side by side qualitative comparison of the assigned clusters. K -means clustering with the extended feature set reproduced the good examples of the baseline clustering, and overall it produced a better categorisation with a higher R 2 value. The additional cluster, beyond those reported by Adamic et al. [2], contains mostly questions ori-ented to polls and surveys. We label the Q&amp;A forum types as follows: factual-information seeking , subjective-information seeking , social discussion , and poll-survey conducting .
Table 1 summarizes the cluster means of these forum types with respect to the variables used for clustering. The fac-tual information seeking forums (e.g. Computer Network-ing) have low average values for all the features: questions and answers are short, with little contradictory feedback. Subjective information seeking forums (such as Pregnancy &amp; Parenting) have the highest question and answer length. Social discussion forums, such as Politics, are characterized by high level of contradictory feedback and high collective participation in answering. Finally, poll-survey conducting forums (e.g., Baby Names) have the lowest question and an-swer length, and the highest asker/replier overlap.
Community expertise networks [1] are social networks in which nodes represent people and edges represent the flow of expertise and knowledge among them. They can be mod-eled as weighted graphs, with previous studies using two different structures for the networks: i) Asker-Replier net-works (ARN) , with directed edges from askers to answer-ers of questions, weighted by the number of answers [13]; ii) Asker-Best Answerer Networks (ABAN) , with directed edges from askers towards best answerers [5, 11], weighted by the number of best answers. ARN treats all answers equally, ignoring  X  X est answer X  information, whereas ABAN excludes information about users who are not selected as the best answerer.

When an answer is selected as the  X  X est answer X  to a par-ticular question, it is done so in comparison with to the other answers of the same question. There is, therefore, an inher-ent competition between the answers of a question, and we can assume that the relative expertise of the best answerer is higher than that of the other answerers of the question. To leverage this information, we propose the Competition-Based Expertise Network (CBEN) , a novel structure for com-munity expertise networks, with directed edges from the non-best answerers towards the best answerer of a question. Figure 1: (a) Relation between users, questions, answers and best answers. On the right, the corresponding (b) asker-replier network (ARN), (c) asker-best answerer network (ABAN), and (d) competition-based expertise network (CBEN).
 This keeps track not only of how many best answers a user has contributed, but also of who they have  X  X eaten X  in the competition to be selected as best answer. In general pur-pose CQA communities, unlike specialized technical forums, asking a question is not necessarily related to a lack of ex-pertise [1, 16], so we do not include the relation between the askers and answerers of a question in CBEN. Examples of the three expertise networks are shown in Figure 1.
We consider each leaf-level category of Yahoo! Answers separately, assuming that each category represents a topic and the users within it are topically relevant. Unlike previ-ous work which relies on human-created ground truth [1, 16, 8, 14], we adopt a prediction-oriented approach for evalua-tion, and evaluate expert finding methods according to their ability to predict the best answerer of a question, based on the knowledge of past interactions. For each leaf-level cate-gory, we extract the CBEN, ARN and ABAN networks, and compute graph centrality measures for them. For each ques-tion, we rank all answerers by their centrality score, and the user with the highest score is predicted as the best answerer. We evaluate using prediction accuracy , the ratio of questions for which the best answerer is predicted correctly.
We study centrality measures belonging to three main families: degree -based centrality ( Degree and InDegree ), dis-tance -based centrality ( Harmonic centrality [4]: c h P y 6 = x 1 /dist ( y,x )), and spectral centrality (weighted PageR-ank and HITS ). We do not consider path -based centrality measures, such as betweenness , since their computational complexity is prohibitive for large datasets.

We partition the dataset by time, extracting networks us-ing data from Jan to Oct 2011 (training period), and based on that we predict the best answerers for questions submit-ted between Oct 2011 to Jan 2012 (test period).
In Table 2 we present the average prediction accuracy for graph-based methods and a number of baselines (random selection, number of answers, number and ratio of best an-swers), grouped by forum type. Factual-information seeking forums have the top performance, followed by subjective-Table 2: Forum Type Average Prediction Accuracy.
 information seeking forums: these are both more suitable for expert ranking than social discussion and poll-survey fo-rums. The best answer ratio has the highest average pre-diction accuracy for all forum types. This is expected, as numerous studies show the high correlation of this metric with expertise [13, 8, 11]. Even best answer ratio performs poorly, however, in social discussion and poll-survey forums.
To test if the differences among the performance of the metrics are statistically significant, we performed paired t -tests ( p &lt; 0 . 01) on the prediction accuracies obtained for each LLC. First, we performed the tests among five central-ity measures within each forum type and network structure separately, finding that PageRank is the best centrality mea-sure of ARN, while HITS is best for CBEN, and InDegree, as shown previously [5], performs best on ABAN.

We repeated the t -tests between pairs of such best net-work / centrality-measure combinations. CBEN HITS sig-nificantly outperforms both ARN PageRank and ABAN In-Degree in the factual and subjective information seeking cat-egories; it is also the only network-based metric that signifi-cantly outperforms both the number of answers and best an-swers for those categories. This is a strong result compared to previous work [5, 16], which suggested that graph-based algorithms cannot outperform these simple metrics. A sum-mary of the paired t -tests for the factual information seeking forum type is given in Table 3, with statistically significant results in bold text. The matrix entries represent the per-centage of leaf level categories where the metric reported in the row has higher prediction accuracy than the metric in the column. Since ARN does not use best answer information, caution is needed when comparing it with other approaches on a best answer prediction task. For this reason we com-plement the evaluation by computing the rank correlation of the network-based metrics with the best answer ratio, as in previous studies [13, 11]. We selected the 10 users with highest centrality (from training data) and computed the Spearman correlation with their personal best answer ratio (from test data). CBEN HITS is also the best approach for this evaluation, with the highest correlation in 40% of factual-information seeking forums and 43% of subjective-information seeking forums.
In the previous section, we saw that prediction accuracy strongly depends on the forum type. In this subsection, we look at the network structure to ask whether such qualitative aspects can be captured quantitatively.

We studied a number of network characteristics, but due to space limitations, we report only the metrics that showed interesting correlations with expert prediction: 1) Number of Weakly Connected Components (# wcc ) 2) Relative Greatest Weakly Connected Component size ( gwcc s ), and 3) Trian-gulation rate (  X  ), the proportion of edges that belong to an undirected triangle. Table 4 shows their average values for each forum type. For ARN and ABAN  X  is determined by how many users become both askers and answerers of the questions. For CBEN it indicates that users show highly overlapping participation in answering questions. Discus-sion and poll-survey forums show high  X  and gwcc s while, as expected, # wcc is considerably lower. These results pro-vide a strong evidence that there is no clear distinction of expert and novice roles in non-expertise based categories: users show highly overlapping participation in question an-swering and there is no real specialization in the choice of questions to answer. Within every LLC, the prediction ac-curacies have a negative linear correlation with and  X  and gwcc s , and a positive correlation with # wcc . These results demonstrate that expertise should not be sought in forums where the dominant user intent is socialising rather than quality information seeking.

More generally, such network properties help identify cases where network-based expertise finding approaches are more effective. We analyzed the network statistics for the 9% of the total of factual and subjective information seeking cat-egories for which the CBEN outperforms best answer ratio, and found that, in particular,  X  is much lower for these cases.
In this paper we introduce a novel network structure for modeling expertise in community question answering por-tals, based on the idea of competition among users to be selected as best answerer. Using a large Yahoo! Answers dataset, we evaluate this network structure for the task of best answer prediction, using a number of centrality mea-sures, and show an improvement over state-of-the-art tech-niques. We also show that, unlike previously used network-based methods for this task, the proposed network type con-sistently outperforms answer count and best answer count, and in certain cases outperforms best answer ratio. By clus-tering Q&amp;A forums by their structural features, we identify 4 forum types, and observe that the prediction task is more difficult for forums dominated by social discussions and sur-veys, as opposed to factual/subjective information seeking forums. A deeper investigation of the networks revealed that network properties of triangulation and connectivity capture the potential predictability of best answerers. For future work, we will further investigate the network features that affect the performance of the task, and integrate topic mod-eling to capture better relevance of users to the categories.
