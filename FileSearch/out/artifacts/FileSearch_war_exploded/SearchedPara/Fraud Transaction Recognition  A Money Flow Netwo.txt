 In this paper, we provide some insights into analysis of fraud trans-action recognition on Alipay X  X  Money Flow Network. We first show that the Money Flow Network follows a power-law distri-bution on daily, monthly or yearly basis, based on which we pro-pose a new approach of fraud transaction recognition on the Money Flow Network from two perspectives. First, the Collapse Network is identified by the discovery that fraud transaction requires a huge amount of active controlled  X  X ombie X  accounts, which are always intentionally manipulated by fraudulent online sellers, and the col-lapse of the Money Flow Network emerges due to their economic inactivity; Second, we define the Activation Forest that leads to the recognition of the controlled  X  X ombies X  even no sooner than they enter into Alipay X  X  ecosphere. These two networks are fully explored from the perspective of detecting  X  X ombies X , and several key features have been adopted into anti-fraud recognition. Ex-perimental results show that our strategy is capable of effectively identifying fraud transactions on the Money Flow Network with the accuracy as high as 99.88%.
 H.2.8 [ Database Management ]: Data Applications X  Data Mining Fraud Transaction; Money Flow Network
Online Shopping, providing a convenient means for purchasing items from various sources, is increasingly flourishing and getting more and more popular in our daily life. In China, over 80% on-line shopping market is mainly facilitated by Taobao, the largest consumer-to-consumer E-commence platform around the world that launched by Alibaba Group in 2003. Taobao serves more than hun-dreds of million active buyers and tens of million sellers along with an online payment system called Alipay, where nearly tens of million transactions are made on daily basis. The huge amount c  X  of money flow addresses the credibility issue of transactions on e-commence.
 Fraud transactions [3] do incalculable harm to buyers and platforms while in favor of insincere sellers from two perspectives. On one hand, similar to most of e-commence markets, Taobao also makes use of the number of completed transactions as a ranking index and a reputation factor for sellers. The ever growing number of buyers on Taobao is the major source of online sellers X  revenue. More of-ten than not, buyers are biased towards those sellers with high sales volume or reputation. As a result, insincere sellers are motivated to boost their sales by a large margin in a short period of time to gain advantages over other sellers. However, it takes time to achieve this end in a regular lifecycle of sales. Consequently, a few insin-cere sellers carry out fake purchases to accumulate sales volume in order to attract more legitimate buyers. Therefore, several buy-ers are misguided into purchasing items seemingly only good on numbers over quality. On the other hand, online sales are always promoted by Taobao and Alipay platforms, for example, buyers are encouraged to do online shopping on holidays by getting re-warded with allowance or gift cards equivalent to the same amount of money they spend on each purchase. In this scenario, insincere sellers misappropriate these rewards by hiring people to make fraud transactions, which would result in a huge loss for the platforms. Although some fraud transactions are often made in a elaborately manner that minor difference of shopping behaviors could be dis-tinguished from legitimate ones, various efforts have been made to detect and intercept fraud transactions in this regard, and follow-up regulations are successfully applied in order to maintain a fair E-commence ecosystem.
 In this paper, we investigate fraud transaction recognition from the perspective of the Money Flow Network. Usually, fraudulent on-line shopping conduct needs a tremendous amount of mendacious buyers referred as  X  X ombies X  that are manipulated by fraudulent on-line sellers, they demonstrate synchronized economic behavior, e.g. each of  X  X ombies X  receives one transfer from the insincere sellers uniformly both in time and amount; a surge of one single mer-chandise purchasing by a group of  X  X ombies X ; hibernated uniformly with no deposit. Two different forms of the Money Flow Network are developed for  X  X ombies X  recognition. The first is called  X  X he Collapse Network X  which measures how the economic inactivity  X  X ombies X  behave in the Money Flow Network; The Second one is called  X  X he Activation Forest X  which monitors the tree topology formed by the first-active transfer of each single account. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 uncovers two topologies of the Money Flow Network on Alipay data: the Collapse Network and the Activation Forest. Section 3 illustrates fraud transaction recognition based on feature analysis of two net-Figure 3: Boom and Collapse Structure Due to Economic Ac-tivity structures of boom and collapse, which are consisted of one root node in the very center that radiates money flows, however the second-order degree increases by several orders of magnitude as a result of normal economic activity and decreases due to economic inactivity (Figure 3). So distinguishable as the local structures are in the network, we observe that 1070 out of 1306 nodes of local net-work possess collapse structures and the rest exhibits boom struc-tures in one randomly selected Money Flow Network (1306 nodes with out-degree larger than 30 are found in tens of millions of edges and nodes in 48 hours).
 Activation Forest : The first entrance of one new account into the money flow network must bring along one directed transfer or de-posit money flow which is pointed to this very account from some money source, we defined this transfer or deposit money flow as an activation money flow. Historically, all the accounts in the money flow network should have this very activation money flow and all the activation money flows will form a bunch of trees which is de-fined as Activation Forest. The Activation Forest is, in fact, char-acterized as follows: suppose node V j is activated by node V (1) V j can only be activated once; (2) V i can activate many ac-counts; (3) V i must be activated earlier than V j ; (4) V activated by another account. This sequence of activation forms a directed acyclic topology illustrated in Figure 4.
We build a framework of fraud transaction recognition system based on the phenomena of collapse and activation on the Money Flow Network for the purpose of tracking and intercepting  X  X om-bies X  at any time, e.g. the first entry or ongoing money flow, and preventing them from affecting legitimate buyers and platforms. Figure 5: Classification of the Collapse Network via Network Features
Since the registration of many E-Commerce sites require only email or phone number,  X  X ombies X  can be produced numerously in short periods. Focus has been put on the recognition of  X  X ombies X  not only through static registration information but also ongoing economic activities. Most of the time,  X  X ombie X  buyers behave ex-actly the same as legitimate buyers when performing transactions. But the way that  X  X ombie X  buyers get their fund source leaves us clues to track them down. For example,  X  X ombie X  buyers stam-pede towards the item after receiving a transfer amount from the insincere sellers, after which their economic activity fades away. Economic inactivity is then used to detect them and be modeled as collapse structure in Money Flow Network: the local network around one fraudulent account will possess collapse structure due to economic inactivity of  X  X ombies X  crowded at the first-order de-gree.
 One attempt is made to demonstrate the relationship between boom and collapse structures in the selected Money Flow Network above. We projected well labeled 1306 root accounts onto two dimensions (log scale) illustrated in Figure 5. We first observe that most of the regular centroid nodes (Section A) hold the property that the second-order or third-order degree booms due to normal economic activities, while the Money Flow Network starts to collapse from other centroid nodes (Section B + Section C) due to abnormally low economic activities. As for Section B, centroid nodes do not boom to Section A because nodes linked to them at the first-order degree behave so much like  X  X ombie X  buyers that they actually are just newly registered users. Section C is full of  X  X ombie X  buyers that they cause the network to collapse because of their synchronous economic inactivity. Besides the recognition of  X  X ombies X  through the ongoing Money Flow Network, however, it X  X  imperative that we detect  X  X ombies X  from their first entrance into the Money Flow Network so their eco-nomic activities could be monitored in a timely manner that further regulations are enforced. Activation Forest extends fraud transac-tion recognition from an individual account to the entire forest. It allows us to take advantage of global features of trees in the for-est, such as tree size, depth, growth rate, activation amount mode, and proportion of activation amount mode, to decide whether trees themselves are abnormal which also provides an intuitive interpre-tation of the network structures.
 It is noted that, in most cases, trees of only two nodes and one edge account for around 73 percent in the forest. While in extreme cases, maximum tree size reaches 240861, maximum tree depth reaches 28, maximum daily growth rate is 38576, and maximum propor-tion of activation amount mode is 100%. This phenomena explains insincere sellers need to activate a large number of  X  X ombies X  re-cursively in favor of fraud transactions. The Collapse Network was constructed on Alipay 48 hours of Money Flow Network consists of tens of millions of edges and nodes, then nodes with out-degree larger than 30 are selected to ensure a second-order degree boom. The Activation Forest was built on Alipay Money Flow Network with historical activation data which also includes tens of millions of edges and nodes. Both net-works were implemented on ODPS-GRAPH, a large-scale graph processing framework based on ODPS 1 . As mentioned before, net-work features play a significant role in fraud transaction recogni-tion. In the Collapse Network, account numbers in the first-order degree, the second-order degree, the third-order degree, and the forth-order degree are considered, while tree size, depth, growth rate, activation amount mode and proportion of activation amount mode in Activation Forest.
 Two datasets are extracted to verify our strategies of fraud trans-action recognition from the Collapse Network and the Activation Forest individually, where each node represents an account which is manually labelled as fraudulent or legitimate based on cognizance history on Alipay X  X  back-end platform through double-review pro-cess by over 100 independent individuals. One dataset was selected with 982 fraudulent accounts and 1018 legitimate ones for testing the Collapse Network, and the other dataset is consisted of 2000 tree nodes with 1031 fraudulent accounts and 969 legitimate ones for testing the Activation Forest. Seven popular classifiers are se-lected for performance comparisons: Lasso Regression(LR), Naive Bayes(NB), KNN(k=5), SVM(linear kernel), Random Forest(RF), AdaBoost, Neural Network(NN)[8].
 All algorithms were implemented with and without network fea-tures to demonstrate the difference using 10-fold cross-validation. All classifiers with network features have a higher AUC [6](the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) than without network features in both scenarios. In the Collapse Network, the AdaBoost classifier without additional network features shows the lowest AUC as equal as 0.8173, and the highest AUC is 0.9988 ob-tained by the Random Forest classifier with network features by an increase of 22.21%. Top three most important features are d d and d 4 /d 1 , where d i represents the i th-order of degree. In the Activation Forest, the Naive Bayes classifier without additional net-work features exhibits the lowest AUC of 0.8408, while the Ran-dom Forest classifier with network features achieves the highest AUC of 0.9947 by an improvement of 18.30%. Top three most im-portance features are growth rate, tree size and proportion of edges whose activation amount equals the mode. It is clear that the addi-tion of network features significantly improves the performance of fraud transaction recognition.
In this paper, we have investigated the fraud transaction recog-nition based on Alipay X  X  Money Flow Network which follows a power-law distribution on daily, monthly and yearly basis. Fraud transaction involves fraudulent buyers referred as  X  X ombies X  who are intentionally collaborated with insincere sellers for making il-legimate profit. Two different kind of networks, the Collapse Net-

 Table 1: The AUC Performance of Collapse Network and Acti-vation Forest with or without Features work and the Activation Forest, are uncovered for identifying  X  X om-bies X  in different phases of online transaction. One is the Collapse Network, which measures how economic inactivity of  X  X ombies X  collapses the ongoing Money Flow Network with four key fea-tures: the first-order degree, the second-order degree, the third-order degree, and the forth-order degree. The other is the Acti-vation Forest, which monitors the abnormality of tree topology of the Money Flow Network accumulated by the first entry of all ac-counts from the very beginning with five key features: tree size, depth, growth rate, activation amount mode, and proportion of ac-tivation amount mode. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach with key network features significantly outperforms the baseline without network features by an improvement as high as 22.21%. The Money Flow Network based on online shopping markets has a brand new network morphology with little study in literature. At the very first time, we have explored the topology of the Money Flow Network regarding fraud transaction recogni-tion, which has been extensively applied to the anti-fraud system of online transaction.
