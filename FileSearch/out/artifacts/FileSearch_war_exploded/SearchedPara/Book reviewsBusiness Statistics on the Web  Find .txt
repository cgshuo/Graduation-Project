Business Statistics on the Web: Find Them Fast X  X  X t Little or no Cost. By Berinstein, Paula (Ed.), 2003, $29.95, ISBN: 091096565X
Government agencies, trade organizations, non-profit organizations, and companies are making large volumes of business statistical data available to the public through the World Wide Web. One goal of such an effort is to enable business people to directly access statistical information online and thus to facilitate their daily decision-making tasks. For example, business statistics can provide information to answer questions like: how large the market is for a product; how much the cost is; and what the dynamics of an industry is. However, for most business people, the challenge is where and how to identify the information needed effectively and efficiently without being overwhelmed by the tide of the Internet waves. To address this issue, Paula Berinstein has recently written a book titled Business Statistics on the Web . In this book the author intends to provide a comprehensive and well-organized collection of online business statistics re-sources.

The book is a quick reference book for business people, journalists, public relations specialists, students, teachers, researchers and anyone interested in business statistics. To facilitate busy business people in using this book, a quick start chapter is provided to present the best general Web resources, the most common trade journals, and the major trade associations. In addition, a straightforward searching approach is also introduced in the quick start chapter. Useful business statistics information can then be targeted more directly by using this approach.

To help business people with limited knowledge on statistics, the second chapter is dedicated to the explanation and illustration of very basic statistical terminologies, such as types of statistics (e.g., raw numbers, percentages, indexes, rankings, averages, and rates), methodologies for gathering and calculating statistics (e.g., census, surveys and questionnaires), and pitfalls (e.g., specious, biased, and flawed analysis).
Non-expert readers on business statistics will benefit from reading this chapter without worrying about their limited statistical knowledge.

The author classifies business statistics sources into six main categories, which correspond to six inde-pendent chapters: US industry sources, Non-US industry sources, Market research sources, Economic and financial statistics, Company information, and Demographics and population statistics. The author collects industry and business data from a wide range of sources, including National statistical offices, International statistical offices, Government surveys, Government publications, Government administrative records,
Research and industry reports, Analyst and bank reports, News releases, Trade journals, and Trade associations. In addition to the general sources, the author also provides Web sources specific to some particular industries such as Agriculture, Energy, Minerals, and Metals, Advertising, Apparel, Construc-tion, and Transportation. To augment the US sources, a variety of industries in non-US countries with a focus on Australia, Canada, the UK, Northern Ireland, Ireland and New Zealand are also listed in the book.

As argued by the author, the best searchers make educated guesses based on what they know about the landscape. Chapter three is dedicated to the introduction of the providers and producers of business sta-tistics. The author classifies them into nine categories including Associations, Companies, Organizations, Economists, Government agencies, Independent survey, Web communities, Non-profit organizations, and Research centers. Sources in both the United States and other countries are listed under these categories.
Such a classification is particularly useful for users who are interested in information organized by types of organizations.

Given the wide range covered and the large number of online sources, it is natural that the author cannot provide in-depth coverage of the content and characteristics of each Web source, even though some of them are deserved (e.g., FedStats is produced by a consortium of more than 70 federal agencies and provides access to thousands of statistical data sets).

The most exciting part of this book is that the author provides more than thirty sidebars and case studies as vivid examples to illustrate the strategies used by the author in particular business statistic searching tasks. The sidebars briefly list the target goal, the source(s) explored, the strategy adopted, and the results. The case studies, on the other side, give a detailed description about the entire searching process, including searching strategies, the queries inputted and the corresponding result, the criteria for information filtering and browsing approaches adopted. At the end of each case study, the author also lists lessons learned and provides tips. Particularly, the last chapter of the book,  X  X  X our competitive advantage: estimating company numbers you can X  X  get X  X  is a comprehensive case study for how to estimate a private company or division of a public company. In this chapter, the author creates a model which demonstrates basic steps for gathering preliminary information about a company and how to get it. In the later part of this chapter, a games software company is utilized as an example to exhibit the procedures of information seeking.

Another contribution of this book that makes it unique is the integration of the author X  X  tips and tricks in business statistical information seeking tasks. In Chapter 4, the author provides six general search tips, such as  X  X  X se the Google search engine for both extremely specific and general statistics X  X  and  X  X  X se phrase searching whenever possible X  X . Additionally, tips for specific search engines such as Factiva,
FindArticles, and eLibrary are also covered. In Chapter 11, special tips and tricks related to specific tasks such as  X  X  X stimating your competitors X  marketing costs X  X  and  X  X  X ow to use government statistics to get a foothold in a topic X  X  are listed to facilitate the information needs of specific business peoples. On the other hand, general readers may also benefit from the strategies used by the author in completing these tasks.

In summary, as a practical rather than research book, this is a decent and well-organized collection of current business statistics on the Web. The sources listed in this book are mostly free or low-cost. The author X  X  unique experiences in business statistics are integrated into the description of statistical sources.
This is particularly useful for busy people or for people with limited knowledge and experiences on business statistical information seeking.
