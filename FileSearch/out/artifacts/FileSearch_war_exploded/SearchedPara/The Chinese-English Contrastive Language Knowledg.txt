 Language knowledge bases are collections of linguistic knowledge that facilitate the performance of these systems significantly [1] .

In this paper, we brief ly review related research in Section 2 , followed by an ove r-view of CECLKB in Section 3 . S ection 4 describes our plan s for employing CECLKB for Computer -Assisted Translation ( CAT ) and Second Language Acquisition ( SLA ) . more future efforts . The construction of a contrastive language knowledge base was first motivated by the employment of new metrics for subsegment -level analysis and the prospect they offer for enhancing Translation Memory (TM) [3 ] . Compared with sentence -level alig n-look at the correspondence between matching expressions in different languages.

Other at the alignment of senses between the two languages with the help of WordNet [1 3 ]. scheme for all entries are based on the anticipated applications of the knowledge base and the findings of relevant linguistic research and translation studies concerned with typical contrasting features of Chinese and English.

As the correspondence between Chinese and English can be found at various le v-els, CECLKB has entries of contrastive knowledge at the word, phrase, chunk and word level.

E ach entry in CECLKB contains a Chinese -English sentence pair 1 , with one and spondence between a selected Chinese word, phrase, chunk or sentence pattern and its corre sponding expression in English . The mark up highlights the syntactic and sema n-tic constraints on the particular instance of correspondence , which adds more dime n-is an exa mple of an entry in CECLKB 2 .
 3.1 Architecture of CECLKB The architecture of CECL KB ( Fig.1) shows that there are four types of entries: word entries, phrase entries, chunk entries and sentence pattern entries. We currently work to enrich the knowledge base and widen its coverage . 
The parallel texts in CECLKB include i) Chinese source texts and their English balanced representation of linguistic phenomena and helps minimize the problems language or the target language) and establish how Chinese words, phrases, chunks or for a range of general purposes. T he size of the parallel corpus is shown in Table 1 .
CECLKB is designed to integrate with other existing language knowledge bases, promoting the sharing of formalized linguistic knowledge among different projects. The Chinese Function Word Usage Knowledge Base [15] is the first that has been rectly through CECLKB. 3.2 Entries in CECLKB texts to obtain fine -grained contrastive knowledge . At present , CECLKB entries focus on: i) adverb s , e.g.  X  X  X  casually , ii ) predicator -complement phrases , e.g.  X  X  X  X  X  ate quite a bit , iii ) BEI+VV+DE+NP 4 , e.g.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  captured pickpocket , and iv ) p assives with or without BEI , e.g.  X  X  X  (  X  )  X  X  X  X  X  the beer was brewed . B e-low we set out the rationales behind our selection of entries .

There are far fewer function words than content words in Chinese. A function word, however, usually carries much more wei ght than a content word does [16 ]. To begin with, we select adverbs as the focus of word entries, which are usually categ o-rized as function words but do have their own lexical meanings.

Predicator -complement phrases come next. They are one of the most frequently further reason for select ing them as t he focus for phrase entries.

A BEI+VV+DE+NN structure represents a typical chunk in CECLKB. A chunk is defined as an ordered sequence of words and word categories , which exhibits special con stitute a phrase of a certain type , such as BEI+VV+DE+NN constituting a co m-typical combination of particular words (  X  and  X  ) and word categories (VV and NN) than as an ordinary phrase .

Entries of the fourth type deal with cases where corresponding Chinese and En g-first select the Chinese passives with or without BEI, which supposedly correspond to English passives. The focus of our observation is set on: i) Chinese passives with BEI, which are not expressed by English passives; and ii) Chinese passives without BEI or Chinese non -passives, which are expressed by English passives. 3.3 Annotation Scheme s The way in which linguistic knowledge is annotated reflects the nature of the relev ant linguistic phenomena and how the formal descriptions are to be used. The annotation s in CECL KB mark up the syntactic, semantic and corresponding relation s in each e n-try , adding additional XML tags to the sentence pairs extracted from the corpus . 
When designing the annotation scheme s , we mainly consider: i) what tags and a t-tributes are needed to mark up the three relations set out below ; ii) whether different range of applications?
For the convenience of explanation, we begin by defining the three kinds of corr e-spondence s (abbreviated as HL, CT and NO respectively) in CECL KB , illustrated by five examples of the adverb  X  X  X  casually and its corresponding English expressions .  X 
HL: H ighlighted C orrespondence ( Examples 2 and 3 ) is a 2 -tuple in a sentence pair , written as HL=&lt;CSeg, ESeg&gt;, where CSeg is the focused Chinese word, phrase, chunk or sentence pattern , and ESeg is an English expression, with CSeg and ESeg being the corresponding expressions of each other .  X 
CT: Contextual Correspondence ( Examples 4 and 5 ) is also a 2 -tuple in a sentence pair , written as CT=&lt;CSeg, ESeg&gt;, where CSeg is the combination of the focused 
English expression, with CSeg and ESeg being the corresponding expressions of each other . Further, there is no sub -segment in ESeg, which corresponds, on its own, to the focused Chinese word, phrase, chunk or sentence pattern.  X  NO: No Correspondence ( Example 6 ) is assumed when there does not exist an 
English expression in a sentence pair , which correspo nds, in either of the two ways mentioned above, to the focused Chinese word, phrase, chunk or sentence pattern. 
XML tags and att ributes are designed to mark up i) the Chinese segments in focus, ii) the context of the focused segments, and iii) the corresponding expressions of the correpondence may involve a diversi ty of syntactic and semantic constrains. It is special ones t hat apply to some entries only.
 mented by an inventory of attributes and values (see Appendix for a selected list) 6 . 
E xample 7 in Table 2 illustrates how predicator -complement phrase entries are a n-notated. The left column of the table shows how the phra se entry is annotated , and the right column zooms in on the three main targets of annotation.
In syntactic annotation we mark up:  X  the focused Chinese phrase (  X  X  X  X  X  X  ) , its syntactic structure and its gra mmatical function in the clause by i) tagging the POS of each word constituent and the sy n-signal a focused phrase ) and the attribute GF (its value being the code of the grammatical function) to the phras al -category tag of the phrase;  X  and its semantic role in the clause by i) tagging its POS or phrasal category , and ii) adding the attribute SR (its value being the code of the semantic role) to the POS or phrasal -category tag of the context ; and  X  structure and its gra mmatical function in the clause by i) tagging the POS of each word constituent a nd the syntactic tree of the expression, and ii) adding the attri b-ute GF to the phrasal -category tag of the expression.

In semantic annotation we mark up:  X  the type of the compl ement by adding the attribute COMP (its value being the code of the complement t ype) to the phrasal -category tag of the complement; and  X  the semantic link of the complement, by adding the attribute COMP_SO (its value being  X  X  X ) to the constituent in the clause that the complement specifies.
In correspondence annotation we mark up:  X  the highlighted correspondence, by adding the attribute CO ( its value being  X  X L X  ) to the tag of the corresponding English expression;  X  to the tag of the corresponding English expression; and  X  the lack of parallelism , by adding the attribute CO ( its value being  X  X O X  ) to the tag of the focused Chinese phrase. 3.4 Progress of Annotation Human annotators following a strict set of guidelines annotate the corresponding native speakers of Chinese, who speak English. The guidelines consist of the general guidelines and consistency by two chief annotators . New rules and samples are added to the guidelines when annotato rs encounter examples not yet covered. processing) and the UAM CorpusTool 8 ( for mark up). An annotation tool is being developed , which will integrate the automatic pre -proce ssing with the human markup Once implemented , we expect to make the tool available to other projects. have been extracted from the parallel corpus. We have completed the second round of 230 entries in the BEI+VV+DE+NP sub -category . The complexity of language makes it extremely demanding to process natural la n-guages automatically and precisely. This being the case, we have designed the co n-describ ed facts about language , which extend the human intelligence us ing CAT and SLA tools rather tha n attempting to substitute it . 4.1 CECLKB and TM Tools in CAT tions extracted from a TM tool be of use to a human translator [4]. The needs of tran s-high light certain type s of entries , which will then be given more weight when the TM tool extracts previous translations. 
Take the Chinese adverb  X  X  X  as an example. The Contemporary Chinese Dictio n-definition and a contextual translation:  X   X  X  X  sth. done at sb. X  X  convenience; without extra effort; sth. that can be done han dily along with sth. else:  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  Please shut the door as you leave. lowing :  X  ( see Examples 2 to 6 ) , and particularly, how this adverb is expressed in contextual correspondence s (see Examples 4 and 5) , something which is usually not available in bilingual dic tionaries ; and  X  probabilistic rules based on the formal descriptions, to assist the translator with his choices and decisions in the process of translation.

We are suggesting that a translator  X  X orrow s  X , but not necessarily  X  X ollow s  X , these probabilistic rules. Information obtained from the analysis of tags, a ttributes and their adverb entries of  X  X  X  exhibit the bilingual c orrespondence as follows 9 :  X  X  X  a re more often expres sed by corresponding English adverbs , such as immediat e-also the manner in which the ac tion is carried out. This is just one example , but t here will be much more contrastive linguistic knowledge that a translator can o btain from CECLKB through TM tools. 4.2 CECLKB and Language Tools in SLA encounters. The learner also needs to understand the range of expressions available to her when voicing her own ideas and feelings.

For instance, w ith the predicator -complement phrases ( see Example 7 ) , a n SLA stand that (  X  )  X  X  X  X  X  X  (window) be shut firmly is different from (  X  )  X  X  X  X  (wi n-dow) can be shut in that the former indi cates how tight the window is shut (the degree of the event) , while the latter indicates if the window can be closed (the potential of the event) . Further, s h e needs to know that (  X  )  X  X  X  X  X  X  is also different from (  X  )  X   X  X  X  X  (window) be solidly built . T he complement  X  X  X  fir m(ly) elaborates on the action  X  shut , while the complement  X  X  X  so lid(ly) comments on the state of  X  wi n-dow . This kind of information is available in CECLKB, with t he type s of compl e-ment s and their semantic link s annotated for all predica tor -complement phrase s .
The learner not only learns to use a predicator -complement phrase to describe an tion s , e.g.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  . Further , it shows that 1 1 phrases with potential complements, e.g.  X  X  X  X  (  X  X  X  X  X  X  ) could command (the whole room) , act as the predicator s in predicator -object constructions, while phrases with degree complements are not found used in this way. See Appendix for the details of the tags for grammatical functions.
There are other ways in which the annotations can be exploited in SLA learning scenarios. The SLA language tool we are developing helps non -native Chinese lear n-ers improve their reading skills. An understanding of function words, phrases, chunks retrieved automatically and dynamically from the knowledge base. depth and formalized knowledge about two (or more) languages will be of significant use to NLP technology . CECLKB is linguistically motivated and can pro vide dyna m-ic and div ersified language assistance for CAT and SLA applications . It achieves this by i) including four different types of knowledge entries, ii) selecting diversified sub -bilingual and sub -sentential contrast from three perspectives in general, and iv) spec i-fying annotations typically applying to some sub -categories only . Further efforts will building of related CAT and SLA tools. 
We are considering making part of the knowledge base available to NLP, SLA and current development of an SLA demonstrator will make a small portion of the knowledge base accessible online.
