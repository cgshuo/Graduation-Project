 Suman Samanta, Shankar Chakraborty n 1. Introduction
The advancement of technology during the last few decades causes to the development of many hard-to-machine materials, such as titanium, stainless steel, high-strength temperature-resistant alloys, ceramics, refractories, fiber-reinforced compo-sites, super alloys, etc. These materials are not suitable to be machined by the conventional machining processes because of their high hardness, strength, brittleness, toughness and low machinability properties. Sometimes, the machined components require high surface finish and dimensional accuracy which cannot be achieved by the conventional machining processes. Moreover, the rise in temperature and the residual stress gener-ated in the workpiece by those machining processes are not at all desirable or acceptable. These requirements have led to the development of newer processes in machining, known as non-traditional machining (NTM) processes. These are non-traditional in the sense that the conventional cutting tools are not employed in these machining processes for metal removal; instead energy in its direct form is utilized, e.g. mechanical energy in abrasive jet machining, electrochemical energy in electrochemical machining, chemical energy in chemical machining, thermoelectric energy in electric discharge machining processes, etc. These NTM processes are not limited by the hardness, toughness, brittleness and machinability criteria of the work materials. Moreover, using these NTM processes, any kind of intricate shape can be generated with high accuracy and precision with minimum residual stress generation. However, the NTM processes are not exactly the substitutes of the conventional machining processes, but can only complement them ( Ghosh and Mallik, 2008 ; Pandey and Shan, 2005 ).

During the last few decades, the varieties of these NTM processes have increased significantly. All these NTM processes have their own process (machining/operating) parameters and performance measures (responses). For effective utilization of the NTM processes, it is very much important to find out the optimal combinations of their process parameters to achieve enhanced machining performance with high dimensional accuracy. Various optimization techniques have already been proposed by the past researchers so as to search out the best conditions of the operating parameters for different machining processes. Rao et al. (2008) applied a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algo-rithm to find out the optimal process parameters for an electro-chemical machining (ECM) process and compared its performance with that obtained by the other optimization methods. Dimen-sional accuracy, tool life and material removal rate of the ECM process were optimized subject to the constraints of temperature, choking and passivity. Rao and Pawar (2009 ) used artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to determine the optimal combination of process parameters for a wire electric discharge machining (WEDM) process. The effects of various WEDM parameters, such as pulse-on time, pulse-off time, peak current and servo feed setting on the machining speed and surface roughness were studied. Rao and Pawar (2010b) and Rao (2010) optimized the process parameters of a multi-pass milling operation using ABC,
PSO and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms. Minimization of the production time (maximization of the production rate) sub-jected to various constraints of arbor strength, arbor deflection and cutting power was considered as the objective function.
Number of passes, depth of cut for each pass, cutting speed and feed were the different cutting strategies. Rao and Pawar (2010a) presented the multi-objective optimization of machining para-meters of a grinding process using various non-traditional opti-mization techniques, e.g. ABC, harmony search and SA algorithms.
Wheel speed, workpiece speed, depth of dressing and lead of dressing were considered as the process variables. The machining performances were production cost, production rate and surface finish which had been subjected to constraints of thermal damage, wheel wear and machine tool stiffness.

ABC algorithm with that of genetic algorithm (GA), PSO, differ-ential evolution (DE) and evolution strategy (ES) algorithms on a large set of unconstrained test functions, and concluded that its performance is better than or similar to that of other algorithms although it uses less control parameters and it can be efficiently used for solving multi-modal and multi-dimensional optimization problems.
 applied to search out the optimal parametric combinations of three most widely used NTM processes, i.e. electrochemical machining (ECM), electrochemical discharge machining (ECDM) and electrochemical micromachining (EMM) processes. The experimental observations and the mathematical models as suggested by the past researchers are used here for solving both the single and multi-objective optimization problems arising out the parametric optimization of the NTM processes. 2. Artificial bee colony algorithm computational technique, first developed by Karaboga in 2005 ( Karaboga, 2005 , 2010 ), and later advocated by Basturk ( Basturk and Karaboga, 2006 ; Karaboga and Basturk, 2007a , 2007b , 2007c , 2008 ). The algorithm is based on the foraging behavior of honey bees. In the following sub-sections, the foraging behavior of honey bees in nature is first described and then the ABC algorithm is presented. 2.1. Foraging behavior of honey bees using Fig. 1 . At the very beginning as there is no information about the probable food sources, some scout bees are set free to search for some food sources. As soon as a scout bee finds a food source, it would become an employed bee. It returns to the hive, unloads some nectar and performs waggle dance to attract the onlooker bees. The exchange of information among bees is the most important phenomenon in the formation of collective knowledge. In the dancing area of a hive, communication among the bees related to the quality of the food sources occurs in the form of a waggle dance. Since information about all the current rich sources is available to the onlooker in the dance area, it would watch numerous dances and choose to employ itself at the most profitable source. Suppose there are two discovered food sources, e.g. A and B. At the beginning, a potential forager would start as an unemployed bee. It has no knowledge about the food sources around the hive. It has two possible options, i.e. to be a scout for searching around the nest for some food sources or to be a recruit after being motivated by the waggle dance of the other foragers for searching a food source. Attracted by the waggle dance of the employed bees, some onlookers engage themselves on the food sources, A and B. After returning to the hive for unloading nectar, every time an employed bee has now two options, either it may dance to attract more onlookers (EF1) or continue foraging by itself without attracting any more onlooker (EF2). Now as soon as the nectar amount of a food source is finished, that food source is called off. The employed bees corresponding to that food source become unemployed foragers having two options, either to search for a new food source (become a scout) or to stay in the hive and get attracted by the waggle dance of other employed bees (become an onlooker). This process continues in the same way. It can be noted that in the foraging behavior of honey bees, three parameters are of prime importance, i.e. (a) food source, (b) employed foragers and (c) unemployed foragers, and the foraging behavior leads to two modes, i.e. (a) recruitment of nectar source and (b) abandonment of nectar source. 2.1.1. Food source
The importance of a food source depends on the following factors, i.e. (a) its proximity to the nest, (b) the richness or concentration of its energy, and (c) the ease of extracting this energy.

For simplicity of the proposed model, however, the  X  X rofitability X  of a food source is denoted by a single quantity. Experimental research can give an idea of how the above-mentioned factors can be ranked in an insect X  X  evaluation of the profitability of a food source ( Karaboga and Akay, 2009 ; Karaboga, 2005 ). It has been shown that a richer food source that is farther from the nest elicits the same profitability rating (as measured by the number of waggle dances) as a source that is closer but not as rich, when they have the same net energetic efficiency. That is, in both the cases, the ratio of difference between the energy gain and the energy cost to the energy cost is the same. It is this number, therefore, which is usually used to describe the food sources. In this model, it is the intention to see how the insects react to food sources with different values of this number, if they are always able to select the  X  X est X  food source in a changing environment. 2.1.2. Employed foragers
The employed foragers are associated with a particular food source which they are currently exploiting or are  X  X mployed X  at. They carry with them some information about this particular food source, its distance and direction from the nest, the profitability of the source and share this information with a certain probability. The higher the probability, the honey bee will do a waggle dance and share the information with its nest mates. It is worthwhile to mention that the employed foragers are only locally informed, they know only of the food source they are currently exploiting and continue frequenting this food source until it is depleted, at which point they become unemployed foragers. 2.1.3. Unemployed foragers
The unemployed foragers continually look out for a food source to exploit. There are two types of unemployed foragers, i.e. (a) scouts, searching the environment surrounding the nest for (b) onlookers, waiting in the nest and establishing a food source
Insect societies are quite sophisticated in their distribution of unemployed foragers. The percentage of unemployed foragers who are scouts varies from 5% to as much as 30% depending on the influx of information into the nest. The mean number of scouts averaged over the varying conditions is about 10% ( Akay and Karaboga, in press ; Seeley, 1995 ).

The waggle dance performed by the employed bees depends upon the distance and richness (profitability) of the food source. The onlooker bees, which are waiting in the hive, are attracted by the waggle dance and get engaged in unloading the nectar. The number of onlooker bees that would be attracted on a single food source mainly depends on the intensity of the waggle dance of the employed bees. 2.2. The algorithm
In the ABC algorithm, the colony of the artificial honey bees contains three groups of bees, e.g. employed bees, onlookers and scouts. The first half of the colony consists of the employed artificial bees and the second half includes the onlookers. In this algorithm, for every food source, there is only one employed bee. In other words, the number of employed bees is equal to the number of food sources around the hive. The employed bee whose food source has been abandoned becomes a scout.
In the ABC algorithm, the position of a food source represents a possible solution to the considered optimization problem and the nectar amount of the food source corresponds to the quality or fitness of the associated solution. The number of the employed bees or onlooker bees is equal to the number of solutions in the population. In the first step, the ABC algorithm generates randomly distributed predefined number of initial population, P (position of the food sources) of SN populations, where P Each position of the food source, x ijk is three-dimensional in nature with i  X  1,2, y ,SN; j  X  1,2, y , D and k  X  1,2, y the dimension of each variable and V is the number of variables in the objective function. After initialization, the population of the positions (solutions) is subjected to repeated cycles, C  X  1,2, y ,MCN (maximum cycle number) of the search process of the employed bees, onlooker bees and scout bees. An employed bee produces a modification on the position (solution) in its memory depending on the local information (visual information) and tests the nectar amount (fitness value) of the new food source (new solution). Provided that the nectar amount of the new source is higher than that of the previous one, the bee memorizes the new position and forgets the old one. Otherwise, it keeps the position of the previous source in its memory. When all the employed bees complete the search process, they share the nectar information of the food sources and their position information with the onlooker bees in the dance area. An onlooker bee evaluates the nectar information taken from all the employed bees and selects a food source with a probability related to its nectar amount. As in the case of an employed bee, the onlooker bee produces a modification on the position in its memory and checks the nectar amount of the candidate source. If its nectar amount is higher than that of the previous one, the onlooker bee memorizes the new position and forgets the old one.

An artificial onlooker bee selects a food source depending on the probability value associated with that food source, p calculated using the following equation: p  X  where fit i is the fitness value of i th solution which is proportional to the nectar amount of the food source in i th position and SN is the number of food sources which is equal to the number of employed bees.
 in memory, the ABC algorithm adopts the following expression: where v ijk is the candidate food position. Although l is determined randomly, it has to be different from i. j is a random number between ( 1,1). It controls the production of the neighbor food sources around x ij and represents the visual comparison of two food positions by a bee. It can be seen from Eq. (2) that as the difference between the parameters of x ijk and x ljk decreases, the perturbation on the position x ijk gets decreased too. Thus, as the search process approaches to the optimal solution in the search space, the step length is adaptively reduced. If a parameter value produced by this operation exceeds its predetermined limit, the parameter can be set to an acceptable value. In this paper, the value of the parameter exceeding its limit is set to its limit value. is replaced with a new food source by the scouts. In the ABC algorithm, this is simulated by producing a position randomly and replacing it with the abandoned one. In this algorithm, providing that a position (solution) cannot be improved further through a predetermined number of cycles, then that food source is assumed to be abandoned. The value of the predetermined number of cycles is an important control parameter of the ABC algorithm, which is called  X  X imit X  for abandonment. Assume that the abandoned source is x i and j A f 1 , 2 , 3 :::: D g , k the scout discovers a new food source to be replaced with x operation can be defined using the following equation: where x max jk and x min jk are the upper and lower bounds of k th variable, respectively. At each candidate source position, the value of v ijk is searched out and evaluated by the artificial bees. Its performance is then compared with that of the old one. If the new food source has equal or better nectar amount than the old one, it is replaced with the old one in the memory. Otherwise, the old food source is retained in the memory. In other words, a greedy selection mechanism is employed as the selection process between the old and the candidate one. The flowchart of the ABC algorithm is shown in Fig. 2 . 3. Illustrative examples
To demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the ABC algorithm for parametric optimization, the machining perfor-mance of three non-traditional machining processes, e.g. electro-chemical machining (ECM), electrochemical discharge machining (ECDM) and electrochemical micromachining (EMM) processes are considered here. For each NTM process, both the single and multi-objective optimization of the responses are performed. For optimizing the machining performance of these three NTM processes, the experimental data and mathematical modeling of the past researchers are considered. After solving the mathema-tical models using the ABC algorithm, the results are compared with those obtained by the past researchers. The corresponding computer code for the ABC algorithm is developed in MATLAB 6.5 with the following control parameters as selected for easy convergence of the parametric optimization problems.

Limit 50 3.1. Electrochemical machining process
Bhattacharya and Sorkhel (1999 ) developed a microprocessor-based electrochemical machining (ECM) setup with controlled electrolyte flow and automatic tool feed for machining of steel materials. An insulated cylindrical solid brass tool of 16 mm diameter and cylindrical workpieces made of EN-8 steel with 19 mm diameter were used for the experimentation purpose. Four controlling (machining) parameters, i.e. electrolyte concentration, electrolyte flow rate, applied voltage and inter-electrode gap, and two process performances (responses), i.e. metal removal rate (MRR) and overcut (OC) were considered. Each of these controlling parameters was set at 5 different levels. A central composite rotatable second-order experimentation plan was used with 31 experimental runs. The values of different machining parameters along with their levels are shown in Table 1 . Bhattacharya and Sorkhel (1999 ) employed response surface methodology (RSM) ( Cochran and Cox, 1981 ; Montogomery, 1997 ) to develop two second-order polynomial regression equations (including interac-tion effects) for two different responses using the coded values of the controlling process parameters. But, in this paper, for early convergence of the ABC algorithm, those second-order regression equations are remodeled with the help of MINITAB software using uncoded values of the process parameters. These RSM-based equations are given as below Y  X  MRR  X  X  1 : 19263  X  0 : 05688 x 1 0 : 13590 x 2  X  0 : 09215 x Y  X  OC  X  X  2 : 10705  X  0 : 01065 x 1  X  0 : 31849 x 2  X  0 : 00266 x where x 1  X  electrolyte concentration, x 2  X  electrolyte flow rate, x  X  applied voltage and x 4  X  inter-electrode gap. 3.1.1. Single objective optimization
The ABC algorithm is now used to optimize the above-men-tioned RSM-based equations where the responses are separately treated. It is worthwhile to mention here that between these two responses, metal removal rate (MRR) is to be maximized and overcut (OC) is to be minimized. Table 2 compares the results obtained from the ABC algorithm and those derived by Bhattacharya and Sorkhel (1999 ) using Gauss X  X ordan algorithm. It is observed that the optimal process parameter settings are significantly changed.

Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively, show the variations of MRR and OC with respect to four ECM process parameters. In these figures, the optimal settings of the process parameters for maximum MRR and minimum OC can be easily observed. Fig. 3 clearly reveals that MRR would increase with the increase in electrolyte concentra-tion, decrease in electrolyte flow rate, increase in applied voltage and increase in inter-electrode gap. Similarly, minimum OC can be achieved with decrease in electrolyte concentration, decrease in electrolyte flow rate, decrease in applied voltage and decrease in inter-electrode gap, as exhibited in Fig. 4 . Thus, a combination of electrolyte concentration  X  75 g/l, electrolyte flow rate  X  10 l/min, applied voltage  X  30 V and inter-electrode gap  X  1.2 mm can be set for obtaining maximum MRR. On the other hand, for minimum OC, a combination of electrolyte concentration  X  15 g/l, electrolyte flow rate  X  10 l/min, applied voltage  X  10 V and inter-electrode gap  X  0.4 mm can be set. These optimal settings are shown in bold faced in Table 2 . At this optimal parametric combination, the MRR is almost doubled (from 0.7245 g/min to 1.4551 g/min) and the OC is drastically reduced from 0.2702 to 0.0824 mm. Thus, it can be concluded that the ABC algorithm-based single objective optimi-zation gives better results for both the responses as compared with those obtained by Bhattacharya and Sorkhel (1999 ). The convergence of the ABC algorithm for MRR and OC are shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b), respectively.

Bhattacharya and Sorkhel (1999 ) extensively investigated the effects of four ECM process parameters on MRR and OC, and observed that for any inter-electrode gap thickness, the MRR would continue to increase with increase in electrolyte con-centration. At higher electrolytic concentration, an enhanced electrolyte conductivity in the machining gap due to higher ionic mobility would be responsible for the increased value of MRR. The
MRR would also continue to increase with increased electrolyte concentration because the increase in electrolyte flow rate and concentration causes an increasing amount of negative electro-lytic ions to produce electrochemical reactions with the metallic ions of the workpiece. An increased electrolyte flow rate would lead to faster removal of the reaction products from the machin-ing gap and offset the possibility of passive layers on the surface of the workpiece. An increase in applied voltage would cause a greater machining current to be available in the machining gap, thereby causing enhancement in the value of MRR.

On the other hand, an increase in electrolyte concentration would cause a gradual increase in OC because at higher concen-tration, there would be formation of a greater amount of reaction products, e.g. sludges, precipitates and gas bubbles. An increased electrolyte concentration might lead to the possibility of the passage of stray current to the machining periphery. An increase in electrolyte flow rate would cause to an increment in OC because of the greater volume of electrolytic ions available in the machining zone. This simultaneously would cause a greater stray current effect at the side wall, due to the formation of stray current flux at the machining zone periphery at higher flow rates. However, the effects of stray current flow would weaken gradu-ally, because of the squeezing of the gas bubble diameters, and the quicker removal of reaction products and gas bubbles from the machining zone. An increase in applied voltage at a particular gap thickness would cause greater electrolyzing current to be available in the machining gap, as well as causing a greater stray current intensity. However, increased gap thickness under such operating conditions would weaken the stray current effect at the boundaries of the flow path. 3.1.2. Multi-objective optimization
In multi-objective optimization of the ECM process, instead of treating the responses separately, both of them are optimized simultaneously. For this, the following objective function is developed ( Rao et al., 2008 ): Min  X  Z 1  X  X  w 1 Y u  X  OC  X  = OC min w 2 Y u  X  MRR  X  = MRR where Y u (MRR) and Y u (OC) are the second-order response surface equations, as given in Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively, OC MRR max are the minimum and the maximum values of OC and MRR, respectively, and w 1 and w 2 are the weight values assigned to OC and MRR, respectively. These weight values can be anything provided that w 1  X  w 2  X  1 and it depends on the priorities of the considered responses as set by the process engineers. Here, equal weights for both the responses are considered, i.e. w 1  X  w The results obtained after solving this multi-objective optimiza-tion problem using the ABC algorithm are shown in Table 3 . The MRR and OC values are obtained as 0.8408 g/min and 0.1075 mm, respectively, and the optimal solution ( Z 1 ) is 0.3485. As Bhattacharya and Sorkhel (1999 ) did not consider the problem of multi-objective optimization of the responses, thus, the results of Table 3 cannot be compared. However, these results are far better than those achieved by Bhattacharya and Sorkhel (1999 ) while treating the responses individually. Fig. 6 exhibits the variation of MRR with respect to OC for multi-objective optimiza-tion of the ECM process. 3.2. Electrochemical discharge machining process
Sarkar et al. (2006) developed a setup to study the influence of various process parameters in an electrochemical discharge machining (ECDM) operation. A stainless steel tool with a dia-meter of 400 m m was chosen for the experiment and micro-drills were generated on 20 20 mm 2 and 5-mm-thick silicon nitride ceramics. Sarkar et al. (2006) considered applied voltage, electrolyte concentration and inter-electrode gap as the control-ling variables (process parameters), and MRR, radial overcut (ROC) and thickness of heat affected zone (HAZ) were the process responses. Each process parameter was set at five different levels, as shown in Table 4 and 20 experimental runs were conducted while adopting a central composite second-order rotatable design plan. Based on the experimentation data of Sarkar et al. (2006) , the following three RSM-based equations are developed using uncoded values of the ECDM process parameters:
Y u  X  MRR  X  X  4 : 96423 0 : 20418 x 1  X  0 : 09862 x 2  X  0 : 00851 x
Y u  X  ROC  X  X  3 : 15622 0 : 08019 x 1 0 : 07678 x 2 0 : 00356 x
Y u  X  HAZ  X  X  0 : 940335 0 : 019541 x 1 0 : 028638 x 2 0 : 003122 x where x 1  X  applied voltage, x 2  X  electrolyte concentration and x 3  X  inter-electrode gap. 3.2.1. Single objective optimization mentioned second-order regression equations while treating the responses individually. Table 5 shows the optimal ECDM process parameter settings as obtained from the ABC algorithm. This table also compares the results of the ABC algorithm with those obtained by Sarkar et al. (2006) using steepest ascent method. It is observed that the ABC algorithm gives significantly better results for all the responses. The MRR is increased from 1.24453 to 1.62603 mg/h,
ROC is reduced from 0.11188 to 0.05912 mm and HAZ is also decreased from 0.055874 to 0.05409 mm. Thus, for maximum
MRR, a combination of applied voltage  X  70 V, electrolyte concen-tration  X  20 wt% and inter-electrode gap  X  20 mm; for minimum
ROC, a combination of applied voltage  X  50 V, electrolyte concen-tration  X  30 wt% and inter-electrode gap  X  20 mm; and for minimum
HAZ, a combination of applied voltage  X  50 V, electrolyte concen-tration  X  22 wt% and inter-electrode gap  X  40 mm can be set. In
Table 5 , these optimal ECDM process parameter settings are shown in bold faced. Figs. 7 X 9 , respectively, show the variations of MRR, ROCandHAZwithrespecttothreep arameters of the ECDM process. In Fig. 7 , it is observed that for the EDCM process, MRR would increase with the increase in the a pplied voltage, and an increase in the values of electrolyte concentration and inter-electrode gap would cause decrease in MRR. Fig. 8 exhibits that the ROC would increase with increase in the applied voltage and inter-electrode gap, and it would decrease when electrolyte concentration is increased. The effects of three ECDM process parameters on HAZ are depicted in Fig. 9 . The HAZ would increase with the increase in the applied voltage, and it would decrease when both the electrolyte concentration and inter-electrode gap are increased. The conver-gence of the ABC algorithm for MRR, ROC and HAZ are shown in Fig. 10 (a) X (c), respectively. 3.2.2. Multi-objective optimization For multi-objective optimization of the responses for the ECDM process, the following objective function is developed: Min  X  Z 2  X  X  w 1 Y u  X  ROC  X  = ROC min  X  w 2 Y u  X  HAZ  X  = HAZ where Y u (MRR), Y u (ROC) and Y u (HAZ) are the RSM-based equa-tions, as given in Eqs. (7) X (9), respectively, ROC min , HAZ MRR max are the minimum, minimum and maximum values of ROC, HAZ and MRR, respectively, and w 1 , w 2 and w 3 are the weights assigned to ROC, HAZ and MRR, respectively. The values of w 1 , w 2 and w 3 can be obtained using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. In this case, it is assumed that all the responses have equal priorities, i.e. w 1  X  w 2  X  w 3  X  0.3333. tive optimization of the three responses for ECDM process are shown in Table 6 . The minimum value of the objective function ( Z ) is observed as 0.58438. It is revealed that at applied voltage  X  50 V, electrolyte concentration  X  30 wt% and inter-electrode gap  X  20 mm, all the three responses of the ECDM process are simulta-neously optimized. As Sarkar et al. (2006) did not consider the multi-objective optimization of the ECDM process, thus, the results of Table 6 cannot be compared with those of Sarkar et al. Basturk and Karaboga (2006) . Fig. 11 shows the variations of all the responses for multi-objective optimization of the ECDM process. 3.3. Electrochemical micromachining process range (1 X 500 m m), it is called electrochemical micromachining (EMM) process ( Munda and Bhattacharyya, 2008 ). The EMM process has immense potential for generating micro-holes, micro-cavities, micro-channels, etc. in varying workpieces. Munda and
Bhattacharyya (2008) observed that for achieving the best per-formance of the EMM process with enhanced production rate and improved profile accuracy, its operating parameters should be properly selected. They developed an EMM setup where a stain-less steel wire of diameter 335 m m was used as a micro-tool and bare copper plates having 15 10 0.15 mm 3 dimension were utilized as workpiece specimens. Five machining parameters, i.e. pulse on/off ratio, machining voltage, electrolyte concentration, voltage frequency and tool vibration frequency were identified to have predominant roles in the EMM process for generating micro-holes in copper material (conductive). MRR and ROC were the two responses. Munda and Bhattacharyya (2008) performed 32 experimental trails while using a central composite half fraction rotatable second-order design plan. The settings of different EMM process parameters along with their corresponding levels are shown in Table 7 . The RSM-based models for MRR and ROC, developed by Munda and Bhattacharyya (2008) while considering interaction effects between different process parameters, are given in Eqs. (11) and (12), respectively
Y u  X  MRR  X  X  1 : 78917  X  0 : 111858 x 1  X  1 : 36263 x 2 0 : 0864044 x Y  X  ROC  X  X  1 : 08149  X  1 : 21039 x 1  X  0 : 448639 x 2 0 : 0821333 x where x 1  X  pulse on/off ratio, x 2  X  machining voltage, x concentration, x 4  X  voltage frequency and x 5  X  tool vibration frequency. 3.3.1. Single objective optimization
At first, this parametric optimization problem for the EMM process is solved using the ABC algorithm while considering the responses separately. Like the ECM process, here also, MRR is to be maximized and ROC is to be minimized. The results of single objective optimization of the responses for the EMM process are given in Table 8 . Munda and Bhattacharyya (2008 ) obtained the optimal settings of different EMM process parameters as pulse on/off ratio  X  1, machining voltage  X  3.0 V, electrolyte con-centration  X  15 g/l, voltage frequency  X  42.118 Hz and tool vibra-tion frequency  X  300 Hz. The values of maximized MRR and minimized ROC were 0.70374 g/min and 20 10 3 mm, respec-tively. In Table 8 , it is observed that the MRR is increased to 1.47 g/min and the ROC is reduced to almost 0. 3.3.2. Multi-objective optimization
For multi-objective optimization, the following objective func-tion is developed where the priority weights for both the responses are taken as 0.5: Min  X  Z 3  X  X  w 1 Y u  X  ROC  X  = ROC min w 2 Y u  X  MRR  X  = MRR where ROC min and MRR max are the minimum value of ROC and the maximum value of MRR, respectively. The results obtained from the ABC algorithm for this multi-objective optimization problem are shown in Table 9 . If the optimal parametric values of Munda and Bhattacharyya (2008) are used for multi-objective optimization, the value of Z 3 is achieved as 686593.2. The ABC algorithm produces a drastic reduction in the value of Z 3 686593.2 to 0.02367).
 4. Conclusions meters of a non-traditional machining process is observed to be of immense importance so as to enhance the related process performance measures/responses. In this paper, the artificial bee colony algorithm is used to search out the optimal para-metric combinations of three NTM processes, e.g. electrochemical machining, electrochemical discharge machining and electroche-mical micromachining processes. The results obtained from single objective optimization of the responses are significantly better than those derived by the past researchers. This improvement is mainly achieved due to the implementation of an ABC-like better optimization technique which is observed to have superior performance over the other population-based algorithms. It is shown that the ABC algorithm can also efficiently solve the multi-objective optimization problems of the NTM processes. The study of the effects of different weights given to the responses in the objective function equations remains a future scope of this paper.
The ABC algorithm can also be effectively applied for finding out the optimal parametric combinations of other NTM processes, like laser beam machining (LBM), electric discharge machining (EDM), wire electric discharge machining (WEDM), abrasive water jet machining (AWJM) and plasma arc machining (PAM) processes.
Using an ABC-like almost global optimization tool, it is now possible for the process engineers to determine the optimal parametric settings of different NTM processes to have enhanced machining performance in real time manufacturing environment. References
