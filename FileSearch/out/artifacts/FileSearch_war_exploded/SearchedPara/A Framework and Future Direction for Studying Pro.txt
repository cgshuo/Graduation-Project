 I am researching how non-governmental organizations (NGOs) utilize social media and social networking sites (SM/SNS) in their efforts to organize, inform, and serve the communities they operate in as well as how th ey use these technologies to communicate and disseminate information. This study will gather data on persons posting on behalf of NGOs and examine SM/SNS data with the goal of developing a framework for both future research and contextual application of SM/SNS as a mediating artifact by NGOs. Many previous studies have addressed similar issues, but those studies are lim ited in context (e.g. one large software manufacturer) and they typically use only one type of research method. I will address this issue by aggregating a large data set and employing mixe d methods to improve the generalizability of my findings and present a replicable framework for future studies of organizational use of SM/SNS.

Last year I began researching studies on the behavior of individuals on social media and so cial networking sites (SM/SNS) in an effort to come up with new ideas of how people use these sites to facilitate productivity and interpersonal communication and collaboration. After conducting a large literature review of studies investigating productiv ity-related applications of SM/SNS, I discovered that a general trend in these types of studies was to perform a contextu al investigation using one type of research method; for example, collecting survey data from users of a social media application hosted on the intranet of a large software manufacturing company. While these studies had interesting insights, they were typically wholly dependent on context and had limited generalizability as a result of the pool of research participants to whom the researchers had access. Another major issue in the study of productivity and SM/SNS is the lack of a robust body of  X  X mpirically based theoretical knowledge X  [3] and a theoretical framework in which to locate research on users of SM/SNS. Researchers of technology-mediated social participation (TM SP) lament the lack of broadly applicable theories of human behavior on SM/SNS [14], and have pushed for the development and application of new theories that transcend contextual approach es [13]. Though a comprehensive theory is likely unattainable, res earch with generalizable results could positively impact our understanding and application of SM/SNS to address real world problems such as climate change and disaster relief by providing a framework for the contextual application of SM/SNS technology. As part of my contribution to this field, I developed a three-part framework of approaches to studying SM/SNS in enterprise environments consisting of the following categories: user-, data-, and theory-centered studies . I will briefly elaborate on the classification scheme I have developed, which will clarify wh y a mixed-method, large dataset approach is important to research in this area. User-centered studies (e.g. [1, 9, 11, 17, 18]) employ qualitative research methods such as surveys, interviews, discourse analysis, and focus groups to describe users' attitudes and perceived behaviors. These studies are inductive in that they directly relate varied user feedback obtained through qualitative methods to specific activity on an SNS. Data-centered studies (e.g. [4, 6, 7, 8, 12]) deduce user perceptions and preferences from large amounts of tracking data and server logs; these studies ar e less common and require system information, which raises issues of access and privacy. Data-centered studies are common am ong large computing companies (e.g. HP, IBM) who build thei r own SM/SNS application and have access to usage data and a large pool of consenting users. A major difference between user-a nd data-centered studies is the distinction between motivation and participation. The feelings experienced by the user when using SM/SNS and the reasons that they use SM/SNS comprise user motivation . This is different from user participation , which is the act of contributing goods to SM/SNS. On an action level [16] , I subscribe to the definition that a motive is a  X  X factor] that increas e[s] the probability that an individual will make a contribution, X  where a contribution is  X  X he effort that is given by individual volunteers to create the collective good X  [5]. User-centered studies investigate motivation, which is fitting since they utilize qualitative measurements that are geared toward learning about user perceptions. Data-centered studi es investigate participation, which is fitting since they measur e actual user contributions on a site and do not rely on user-reported usage, which can be erroneous. Finally, theory-centered studies (e.g. [2, 3, 5, 13, 15]) construct theoretical frameworks and models for describing user behavior in SM/SNS. Theory-centered studies review the history of SM/SNS, aggregate user-and data-centered case studies, and incorporate social science theory (e.g. social capital theory, social cognitive theory, etc.) into explanations of user behavior. User-centered studies that employ qualitative methods are often limited by user perception, whic h may be different than actual usage patterns. Data-centered studies accurately describe actual usage patterns, but are typically limited to (corporate) networks where researchers have unlimited access to user contributions. Theory-centered studies are useful in attempting to explain human behavior, but lack empirical evidence (or rely on past case studies) and are (in some cases) restricted to the application of a single social science theory to a small dataset. 1 It is well known that non-govern mental organizations (NGOs) have a large social media presence. My research agenda is to aggregate a large set of social media data from NGOs and study how they use this technology in their efforts to organize, inform, and serve the communities they opera te in as well as how they use these technologies to communicate and disseminate information. I plan to utilize methods such as content analysis (through the use of a text classifier), social ne twork analysis, and possibly (if the scope of the project permits) a su rvey of persons responsible for posting content at NGOs. Through the lens of activity theory, I plan to investigate how NGOs use SM/SNS as a  X  X ediating artifact X  [16, 10] to achieve their organization-level goals. In future research, I plan to conduct an ethnographic case study to increase the robustness of my findings. My goal with this research is to develop a picture of how organizations leverage SM/S NS for productive ends. My contribution to studies of user behavior on SM/SNS will be the development of a model of user behavior that takes into account previous research and helps illuminate context-specific observations, and a framework that locates and guides future research in this area.
