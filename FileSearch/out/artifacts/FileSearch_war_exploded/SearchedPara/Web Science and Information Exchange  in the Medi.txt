 The amount of social media data dealing with medical and health issues increased significantly in the last couple of years. Medical social media data now provides a new source of information within information gaining contex ts. Facts, experiences, opinions or information on behavior can be found in the Medicine 2.0 or Health 2.0 and could support a broad range of applications. This workshop is devoted to the technol ogies for dealing with social-and multi media for medical information gathering and exchange. This specific data and the processes of information gathering poses many challenges given the increasing content on the Web and the trade off of filtering noise at the cost of losing information which is potentially relevant. J3 [ Life and Medical Sciences , H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Algorithms Web Science, Social Web, Medicine Health information is exchanged to an increasing extent in the Web. Patients are blogging about th eir experiences in living with certain diseases. They discuss health-related queries in forums or even inform the public about th eir current health status via Twitter. Physicians are reporting about their daily experiences in treating patients. Beyond, research results and related issues are reported. Medical social media data now provides a new source of information within information gaining contexts. Facts, experiences, opinions or information on behaviour can be found in the Medicine 2.0 and could support a broad range of applications. Health organizations monitor online news repositories and web pages for relevant data on epidemiological events. Physicians learn about the experiences of their colleagues provided through social media platforms such as weblogs, or forums. Moreover, patients can search for information or experiences of others which can lead to patient empowerment. The research community becomes increasingly aware of new possibilities and research challenges of the medical Web. The intention of this workshop is to provide a platform for exchanging technologies for dealing with social-and multi media for medical information gathering and exchange. Language peculiarities, content diversity, streaming nature of this specific data poses many challenges given the increasing content on the Web and the tradeoff of filtering noise at the cost of losing information which is potentially relevant. Further the processes of information gathering make several demands th at need to be considered in research as well. The Second International Workshop on Web Science and Information Exchange in the Medical Web (MedEx 2011) offers the opportunity to pr esent work related to these problems. This workshop is intended to conti nue with the First International Workshop on Web Science and Information Exchange in the Medical Web that was held in conjunction with WWW 2010 in Raleigh. The topic of medical Web science and information exchange fits very well with the general theme of the CIKM conference and attracted already high interest in its first release. Around 25 attendees joined the workshop, six papers where presented and we had an acceptance ratio of 75%. The workshop considers tasks and problems re lated to Web Science in one specific application domain, whic h is medicine. This domain and the problems are extremely relevant for current research, government and industry. Governme nt and health organizations become increasingly aware that ther e is a need for considering the developments in the medical Web. Possible application scenarios are currently set up and researchers start to develop appropriate technologies. Furthermore, the organizers of the workshop coordinate and participate in an European project (STREP, M-Eco http://www.meco-project.eu) that focuses on this topic. The consortium is composed of res earchers typically publishing at Web science, data mining a nd NLP venues. Therefore the workshop provides an initial forum for them to further pursue these directions and to provide high level contributions. The aim of the workshop is to encourage researchers from the medical web science community to present novel issues and techniques related to medical intelligence (especially in the context of web science). This workshop is intended to address different aspects related to the problem of accessing, exchanging, processing, and filtering health re lated Web information. Another important question is how to make corresponding applications more reliable and adaptable. The workshop serves as a forum for the confluence of new and multidisciplinary ideas that will help to drive research in the areas of medical web text and data mining . As a target audience, researchers and practitioners from web science, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, medical informatics, natural language processing and related areas are invited to submit their original pa pers in this workshop. As the workshop organizers are participating in European projects which have the workshop X  X  topics at their core, we expect significant interest from about 20 partners as a minimum. The workshop theme and topics are reflecting the latest discussion in that upcoming field and comprise the analysis of medical social media data and multi media data, including event detection and information extraction in this field. Even though it would be very useful, personalization techniques are still not integrated or only implemented to a limited extent in medical applications. Evaluation of implemented medical applications working with Medical Web data is still a problem due to missing annotated data sets and gold standards. This wo rkshop is intended to encourage researchers thinking also into this direction. In more detail, papers covering at least one of the following topics are expected:  X  Analysis of medical social media data  X  Analysis of medical multi media data  X  Event Detection and information extraction in medical  X  Personalization in medical applications  X  Evaluation in medical web applications The workshop will comprise two keynotes. Sophia Ananiadou will give a talk on latest developments in biomedical text mining and implications for the medical web. Wendy Chapman X  X  keynote will discuss the shortcomings and barriers in the clinical natural language processing (NLP) domain and envisions the creation of an NLP ecosystem for the medical domain. Three full papers have been accepted and will be presented. A novelty in this year are short communications where research questions will be raised. These contributions will be the starting point for discussions on the future developments in this interesting area. The presentations will be grouped according to topic so that presentation. The discussions are expected to provide as outcome ideas on future work and becoming aware of current challenges. The results of the discussions will be an additional outcome of the project. There is an increasing interest in using Web data in various applications supporting medicine and health. The Second International Workshop on We b Science and Information Exchange in the Medical Web will provide the platform for ongoing discussions on this topic and will allow to exchange research ideas and work. Kerstin Denecke is a senior researcher at the L3S Research Center in Hannover, Germany. He r main research interests are natural language processing, text a nd data mining, in particular in the medical domain. The specific areas she has been working on include medical language proce ssing, information extraction, sentiment analysis and text classification. Peter Dolog is an associate professor of computer science at Aalborg University where he also leads Intelligent Web and Information Systems group (http://iwis.cs.aau.dk). His main research interests fall into intelligent web information systems. This includes personalization a nd adaptation strategies and algorithms for world wide web, adaptive hypermedia, conceptual modeling of web applicati ons, knowledge management, personalized web based system s, and web transactions. The workshop is supported by the M-Eco project, partly funded by the EU.
