 In some interactive image retrieval systems, users can select images from image search results and click to view their sim-ilar or related images until they reach the targets. Existing image ranking options are based on relevance, update time, interestingness and so on. Because the inexact description of user targets or unsatisfying performance of image retrieval methods, it is possible that users cannot reach their targets in single-round interaction. When we consider multi-round interactions, how to assist users to select the images that are easier to reach the targets in fewer rounds is a useful issue. In this paper, we propose a new kind of ranking option to users by ranking the images according to their difficulties of reaching potential targets. We model the interactive im-age search behavior as navigation on information network constructed by an image collection and an image retrieval method. We use the properties of this information network for reachability based ranking. Experiments based on a so-cial image collection show the efficiency of our approach.

When users search images in an image collection, they first input some queries, which can be keywords or images, to get some initial image search results. When the initial results are not satisfied, some image retrieval systems provide inter-faces of user interactions, e.g, relevance feedback, to gather additional information for refining the search results.
They allow users to click images to view other similar or related images until they reach the targets. For example, Figure 1 shows an example of Google image search 1 . After a user inputs  X  X yoto X  as the keyword for search, Google returns the initial image search results. There is a link of  X  X earch by image X  for each image in the search results. The user can click these links to reach further results un-til he finds satisfied results. After several rounds, this user finally finds his target image which may be about the cherry-blossom at Arashiyama in Kyoto in spring.

Existing image ranking options are based on content or context relevance, update time, interestingness and so on. They concentrate on initial image search results or refined results of the single-round interaction. They do not consider the possible results in subsequent multi-round interactions. However, some reasons can lead to users X  failures on reaching the targets in the initial or refined results. For example, users do not exactly describe their specific targets in the queries and single-round interactions because it is a difficult or boring task; users X  targets may be still not clear when they start their searches, because they are just seeking the information they are interested in; the performance of image retrieval methods are still not good enough to return results which can match the query topics or detect user intentions for personalized search results.

If we can assist users to select the images that are easier to reach the targets, users can cost fewer interactions and spend less time in search sessions. For this purpose, we need to consider what kind of results can be returned after multi-round interactions. In this paper, we propose a new kind http://images.google.com of ranking option by ranking the images, according to their difficulties of reaching the potential targets.

The image search behavior with multi-round interactions in a search session can be regarded as navigation on the in-formation space of an image collection. A query image or the first clicked image in the search results of a query key-word can be the start of this navigation. The end of this navigation can be some images which may contain the fi-nal target images. The user may find the targets or fail to find the targets in current search session and give up at the end of this navigation. We thus construct an image infor-mation network for interactive image retrieval on a given image collection based on a specific image retrieval method. The nodes in the network are images, and the edges in the network depend on the image retrieval method which can return top k search results from the image collection for a given image.

We leverage the properties of this information network which can indicate the difficulty of reaching target images from start images to propose our ranking method. Note that our work of ranking by reachability is used as a ranking op-tion on the image search results, like ranking by relevance, update time, and so on. It is independent on the image re-trieval methods which are used to generate the search results and construct the information network. It can be integrated with these methods.
 The contributions of this paper are as follows.

First, we propose a novel kind of image ranking option based on the ideal reachability of images to other images. It is able to reduce the rounds of user interactions and acceler-ate the processes of reaching the targets in search sessions.
Second, we construct image information network for a given image collection based on a specific image retrieval method to reflect user navigation behavior on the images. The properties of this information network are used for our image ranking approach.
 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we list some related work. In section 3 we propose our image ranking approach. We report the experimental results in Section 4 and give a conclusion in Section 5.
On one hand, Datta et al. [1] list many works on image retrieval. Many of them focus on the issue of one query and its direct image search results without further interactions.
On the other hand, Relevance feedback (RF) has been widely used in image re-ranking in supervised scenarios and is an important solution in interactive image retrieval. Rui et al. [2] and Porkaew et al. [3] proposed query re-weighting, reformulation, modification, point movement and expansion approaches. Tang et al. [4] used one click relevance feedback which only required the user to click only one query image to minimize the effort of relevance feedback instance selection.
The ranking methods used in all above-mentioned related work are relevance based while our work is reachability based. They mainly consider only single-round user interaction and the corresponding ranking results. They do not consider the scenario of multi-round interactions in the search sessions.
In this section, we introduce our detailed reachability based ranking approach. After modeling our scenario of interac-tive image retrieval, we first construct the information net-work for a given image collection based on a specific image retrieval method. After that, we rank the images in the search results of the image retrieval method based on the properties of image nodes in the information network.
Our model of interactive image retrieval is as follows. We define an image as a i in a given image collection C . In a search session, the queries that user input can be images or keywords. In the case of query by image, the start image is the query; in the case of query by keyword, the start image is the clicked image in the initial search result. The start image can also be any clicked image which is not the target in the search session. This definition of start image can simplify the constructed information network with only one type of nodes. Each node in this graph represents an image. There is no node representing other types of objects such as text. It can simplify the analysis on the graph when using it for various applications.

It may be boring for users to input too many additional actions in user interactions, and users may prefer succinct and convenient interfaces. Therefore, in our scenario of in-teractive image retrieval, in each round of user interaction, a user selects and clicks only one image. After the user clicks, a specific image retrieval method F is used to return top k image search results by using this clicked image as query. This image retrieval method can use either visual content information or textual context information of the clicked im-age. Such one click interface is used in recent image search engine like Google image search. There are several rounds of user interactions in a search session. The images clicked in all rounds construct a navigation sequence on the graph. In addition, even if multiple images are clicked in one round, we can regarded that there is a unique path from the start to the target and one of the clicked images is on this path.
The definition of search session is somewhat different from existing work in the areas like web page search. We assume that when a user modifies his original query, the current search session is regarded as finished, no matter whether the user reaches his targets. There are no jumps from one image node to another image node between which there is no edge because such a jump is regarded as a new session. In this way, the navigation behavior on the image information network in a search session is continuous by following the edges on the graph.
The steps of image information network construction for an image collection C based on an image retrieval method F are as follows. 1. Create a node for each image a i in C . 2. For each image a i , compute its top k image search results A i from the image collection by using the image re-trieval method F . 3. Create an edge from a i to each image a j in A i . This image information network G k is thus a directed graph.
Because we assume that users only view and click the images from the top k ranked images in the search engine results page (SERP). The out degree of nodes in this con-structed information network is at most k . This constraint is able to control the number of edges of the graph and the time cost when computing the graph properties for analysis.
In addition, the relevance score or similarity score between a and each image a j in A i can be stored as the weights of the edges. Because it is not necessary in this paper, we still use same weights (equal to 1) for all edges.
This constructed information network has various poten-tial applications, for example, global performance evaluation of image retrieval methods on data collections, user intention detection in a search session and final user targets prediction. In this paper, we use it to rank images based on reachability to potential targets. Our ranking approach provides a differ-ent ranking option by reachability. It can be integrated with various image retrieval methods which are used to generated the search results.

In the communities of graph theory and social network analysis, many metrics have been proposed for analyzing various properties of graph and information network, e.g., average shortest path, diameter, centrality and so on. The length of shortest path of two images on information network can show the difficulty of reaching the target image from the start image in ideal. Some centrality measures of nodes are defined based on shortest path, for example, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality.

Betweenness centrality of an image node is defined as the number of shortest paths from all nodes to all others that pass through this node. Closeness centrality of an image node is defined as the inverse of the sum of the length of the shortest path of this node to all other nodes. They can indi-cate the reachability of the nodes to potential targets, and we will use them to provide two alternatives for our ranking approach. For the given image collection C , specific image retrieval method F and information network G k , we rank these top k images based on one of the centrality measures.
These two centrality measures represent different assump-tions on user behaviors. Betweenness centrality assumes that from start node a s to target node a t a user selects the shortest path p st , and the evaluated node a i is on the shortest path. Closeness centrality assumes that from the evaluated node a i to the target node a t a user selects the shortest path p it . Both of these two assumptions are ideal because of using shortest paths. Users may not select the ideal shortest paths to reach the targets. West et al. [5] made an analysis of human wayfinding in entity information network. They find that human wayfinding is different from shortest paths but is still very efficient. Our ranking method is to assist users to select the paths more close to ideal ones if users select the top ranked results by our ranking method.
These two centrality measures are global and computed based on the whole image information network G k . We use Gephi [7] to compute the centralities. The information net-work construction and computation of centrality for a large graph are time-consuming. It results in the dynamic prob-lem and scalability problem. Current implementation of our approach needs offline pre-computation and is proper for static image collection which does not update frequently and is not too large. In the experiments, we use a public social image collection with tens of thousands of images.

To solve the dynamic problem, a solution is to do the offline pre-computation at some timestamps. To solve the scalability problem, in the future work, we can use the ap-proximate algorithms in the existing work such as [6] for centrality computation, so that our approach can handle large scale image collections.

Furthermore, the ranking approach provides general rank-ing results and does not consider specific user intention, for the future work, we will focus on how to detect specific user intention and predict personalized targets by utilizing the graph model and partial navigation sequence.
The dataset we use for our experiments is MIRFlickr 25000 [8] which is constructed by images and tags downloaded from Flickr. It contains 25,000 images and provides the raw tags of these images on Flickr. We use two kinds of visual features as two different content based image retrieval approaches. One is a color feature. The feature descriptor is a 1024-Dimension color histogram on the HSV color space. The other one is the SIFT feature with the bags of words model and 1000 visual words in the codebook.

We generate the top k similar images of an image by com-puting the distance of visual feature vectors. There are vari-ous visual distance measures and we arbitrarily use the Pear-son correlation distance in these experiments. The visual distance between image a i and a j is defined as s ( a i , a P x ( H H ( x )  X  P y H i ( y ) / N , where H i and H j are visual feature vectors. N is the size of the visual feature vector.
We also use a textual based image retrieval approach which searches textual related images to the query image. The textual information in the dataset is social tags. We use the tag list of an image as its textual feature vector, and generate the top k relevant images of an image by com-puting the cosine distance of textual feature vectors. The textual distance between image a i and a j is defined as, t ( a i , a j ) = |T i  X  X  j | / p |T i | X  X T j | , where T i and T tual feature vectors, and |  X | is the number of tags. The images without textual information have no related images.
In our experiments, we first use one of the given image retrieval methods F to generate top k ( k =50) image search results which are regarded as  X  X riginal X  ranking results. Af-ter that, we construct the information network G k and rank these top k image results with our approach using the prop-erties of G k . The new results are regarded as  X  X etweenness X  and  X  X loseness X  ranking results respectively.

To evaluate the performance of the ranking results based on different ranking options, we assume that users only se-lect the images from the top r ( r  X  k ) images in the search results in their interactive image search sessions. We respec-tively construct new information network with the top r im-ages in the ranking results for each ranking option. After that, on one hand, we use the average shortest path length (ASPL) in these new information networks as the evaluation metric. This metric reflects ideal multi-round global perfor-mance of an image retrieval method by using all rounds of user interactions in a search session and considering the im-ages in the whole data collection, though not all start and target image pairs included in this evaluation metric are meaningful enough. Note that when r = k , the performance of different ranking options are same because the nodes and edges of the information network are same.
On the other hand, we also evaluate the average diversity (AD) in the single-round image search results. The diver-sities of multi-round image search results can be computed by averaging the single-round diversities of images on the paths. Higher diversity means that it can provide more di-verse candidates in a limited number of top search results and thus assist users to reach the targets easier. Table 1: Comparison of Average Shortest Path Length (ASPL) and Average Diversity (AD) be-tween Original Ranking Results of Image Retrieval Methods and Reachability based Ranking Results Method Ranking Option
Table 1 lists the experimental results. We respectively evaluate the performance on r = 10 and r = 25. The results on metric ASPL illustrate that our ranking approach based on different centrality measures have smaller ASPL than the original ranking results, which means our approach can as-sist users to reach the targets more quickly and with fewer rounds of interactions in ideal. In addition, the ASPL based on closeness centrality is higher than that based on between-ness centrality. It is because closeness centrality allows users to select non-shortest paths between the start and the tar-get images. Note that an ASPL with value l does not mean that a user needs l -round interactions to reach a reasonable target. All images on a path can be reasonable targets.
The results on metric AD in Table 1 illustrate that our ranking approach can generate results with higher diversities and thus can accelerate the processes of reaching the targets in search sessions.

Figure 2 shows the shortest paths between a pair of start and target images based on different ranking options. It uses the textual based method and a user is assumed to be enjoying various  X  X et X  images. The start image is a  X  X og X  image and the target image is a  X  X at X  image. Such a pair of start and target concepts is reasonable while a user is view-ing  X  X og X  images and changes his interest to  X  X at X  images. The start concepts and target concepts can be more differ-ent. For example, the example used in [5] for navigation in entity information network of an information seeker is from  X  X ik-dik X  to  X  X lbert Einstein X  on Wikipedia pages.

Because betweenness centrality indicates the property as-sociated with the shortest path between start and target images, we use it as the sample here. In this example, our ranking approach uses fewer steps to reach the targets. Be-cause the dog and cat in some images of this example are very small, we mark them in the figure with yellow circles. This example also shows that our approach is possible to provide reasonable paths. For these start and target im-ages, the possible path of our approach may only contain images with concepts of  X  X et X  or  X  X nimal X . The path of the original ranking results may be not reasonable for user selec-tion because a  X  X og X  image is connected with a  X  X oat X  image through the concepts in the background. In this example, a user may tend to use the path provided by our results.
Furthermore, there are some pairs of start and target image that have no path in the information network con-structed by the top r ranking results. In such case, after increasing the value of r and k , these pairs can finally have paths. If the path is very long, it means that the target image is difficult to reach from the start image by the given image retrieval method.

In this paper, we propose a new kind of ranking option by ranking the images according to their reachability to poten-tial targets. We model the image search behavior with user interaction as navigation on an image information network. We use the properties of this network for reachability based ranking. This ranking approach provides ideal and general results without considering specific user intentions. In future work, we will focus on predicting personalized targets. [1] R. Datta, D. Joshi, J.
