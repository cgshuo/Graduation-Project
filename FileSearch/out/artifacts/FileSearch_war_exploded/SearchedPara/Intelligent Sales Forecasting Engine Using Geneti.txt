 Times series technique s have been extensively used for Sales forecasting. Research has established that a combination forecast works better than a single forecast. Our research attempts to design an Intelligent Forecasting Engine which will use a combination forecasting technique. This design is based on use of Genetic Algorithms, for se lecting the best methods to combine for forecasting. Early results demonstrate that Genetic Algorithms have the potential to become a powerful tool for time series sales forecasting.

Classical Forecasting models are mathematical in nature, ranging from the class of statistical models to exponential smoothing models and ne ural networks [1]. In our proposed forecasting system, we decompose the series into 3 components trend, seasonality and irregular component. Each of these components is individually forecasted and their forecasts are multiplied back to get the final forecast. Further we design a forecasting engine, which uses a combination forecast from multiple forecasters. Recent re searchers in [6] [7] have developed a set of unique methods for a combination forecast. These methods utilize about a million different forecasting  X  X xperts X  to generate a single forecast at a point. In this paper we propose a combination tec hnique, based on using Genetic algorithms to identify a  X  X ood X  subset of experts to combine. The result of applying our algorithm has been documented for a The magnitude of the problem motivates one to look for an alternative and machine learning techniques could prove the key. This research attempts to find a group of strong experts for a particular series and that too early in the series. In this process certain  X  X ad X  experts are discarded too. This paper presents the results of applying an innovative technique based on machine learning technique of Genetic Al gorithms for learning the top K consistent experts for a given series. Genetic Algorithms (GA) is a programming technique that mimics biological evolution as a problem-solving strategy. For a given problem, the input to the GA is a set of potential solutions to that problem, encoded in some fashion, and a metric called a fitness function that allows each candidate to be quantitatively evaluated. GAs operates on a popul ation of potential solutions applying the principle of survival of the fittest to produce better and better solutions. [9][10] The expectation is that the average fitness of the population will increase with each generation, and so finally, very good solutions to the problem can be discovered [8]. A GA involves the following phases: Selection determines the initial population Encoding decides the representation of each selected parent in the population in a form suitable for further steps of the GA. Crossover produces new individuals (offspring) by combining the information contained in the parents Mutation involves changing the offspring by small perturbations, with low probability. Reinsertion: After producing offspring they must be inserted back into the population. The performance of any GA based solution depends on Crossover Probability, Mutation Probability and Population Size We now propose an innovative GA based algorithm, to identify a set of  X  X ood X  experts to use in a combination forecast. This algorithm uses part of the given times series as training set to genetically select the subset of methods that will collectively give us a forecast that is accura te. In Sales forecasting literature, MAPE is the preferred choice of error measure. [1] [2] Our design attempts to find a set of experts, early in the series, whose combination minimizes the MAPE. The given time series is deco mposed into three components Seasonality(S), Trend (T) and Irre gular Component (I), using a standard decomposition scheme as described in [1]. The T, S and I models are called atomic forecasters. Each triplet of expert is generated by the Cart esian product of individual T, S and I experts. Each atomic forecaster belongs to the ARIMA family. The entire expert set c onsists of the various experts obtained from the Cartesian pr oduct of 86 Trend Experts, 33 Seasonal Experts and 34 Irregular Experts (96492). Hence the total number of forecasts is very large. [6] [7] We now propose our innovative GA to find a good set of forecasters to combine. (f) The Steps c, d, and e, above are repeated for every point in 
A series of experiments were conducted to verify the efficacy of our proposed algorithm. In this section we describe the experimental set up used to analyse the performance of the algorithm. We further provide empirical results on a set of standard benchmark sale s demand times series. Standard times series from the Times Series Data Library 
TSDL) [22] and US economic tim es series from [11] have been used. A standard decomposition method is used to split each series into its T, S and I components. [7] The description of the experts is given in [7]. The algorithm was implemented by varying the size of the training set from 50% to 90% of the points of the series. 1. The first two years X  data (24 points) are used as history. 2. Forecast 25th point based on all experts. Top 10 experts are selected as part of the initial population of experts. 3. This is continued for the next 11 points and at each point; top 10 experts are added to the popula tion of fit parents, forming the initial 120 fit experts population. 4. The steps of crossover, mutation and reinsertion are performed at every point until we reach the number of points dictated by the training size percentage. 5. The surviving set of fit experts is used to forecast for the rest of the series. individual forecast values of all the fit experts. In this section results obtained by the proposed GA algorithm are compared with results obtaine d by various other techniques. Table 1 shows the MAPE values obtained by the various other methods of forecasting like the standard Holt Winter (HW), and DTopK (explained in an earlie r section). The HW is the standard single method used for forecasting demand sales [1]. The  X  X est X  method indicates forecasting the next point, by using the expert that has performed th e best, most number of times at all previous points. The  X  X ean All X  method just takes the average of all experts at every point. The results are indicated for 31 standard sales times series [11[12]. In Table 2 the results of applying the GA are tabulated. The results indicate the various MAPE values obtained fo r different values of training set size. Once the training size exceeds 50%, the GA performs better than all the other methods for almost all series. At 70% training size the method performs better than all methods for all the series. The results also indicate that increasing the training size beyond 70% does not offer any extra advantage for most series. Further for the series with hi gh MAPE values, (MAPE &gt; 7) the GA offers a huge decrease in MAPE. Training sizes below 50% do not offer any benefits. An innovative application of genetic algorithms to the problem of choosing a good set of forecasters for times series was proposed. Earlier work in using GAs for forecasting have almost entirely concentrated on parametric methods of forecasting where the GA was used to identify good parameters for regression equations [9]. Another set of researchers have heavily used GAs for times series forecasting by combining them with neural networks. [10] Our work is unique in its approach and in addition to being able to perfo rm better than other methods offers two huge benefits:
