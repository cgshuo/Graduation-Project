 searchers in various fields. Evolutionary algo rithms (EAs) have been recognized to be of EAs in multiobjective optimization, which is perhaps a problem area where Evolu-tionary Computation really distinguishes itself from its competitors [1]. fuzzy logic and evolutionary computation [2]. Its research production refers to many engineering problems [3]-[6]. quantum computing to AIS. In [7], quantum-inspired computing was proposed. A solving the high dimensional function optimization problems. It should be noted that although QICA is based on the concept of quantum computing, QICA is not a quan-immune clonal multiobjective optimiza tion algorithm (QICMOA). In QICMOA, individuals (antibodies) in a population are represented by quantum bits (qubits) [3]; the fitness value of each Pareto-optimal individual is assigned as the average distance objectives, which is called crowding-distance and proposed in NSGA-II [8]. Accord-ing to the fitness values, only less-crowded Pareto-optimal individuals are selected to attention to the less-crowded regions in the trade-off front. extended directly to the multiobjective cas e by allowing an arbitrary number of knap-sacks. Multiobjective 0/1 Knapsack Problems with n knapsacks (i.e. n objectives and n constraints) and m items in [10] can be defined as follows: Where according to knapsack i ; i c =capacity of knapsack i . find a set of Pareto-optimal solutions approximating the true Pareto-optimal front. 3.1 Representation than other representations [3], which are defined below. Definition 1. The probability amplitude of one qubit is defined with a pair of numbers (, )  X   X  as Satisfying Definition 2. A qubit antibody as a string of m qubits is defined as: where 22 1, ( 1, 2,..., ). ll lm  X  X  +== 3.2 Description of the Algorithm quantum-inspired immune clonal multiobjective optimization algorithm (QICMOA). The main loop of QICMOA is as follows. Algorithm 1: quantum-inspired immune clonal multiobjec-tive optimization algorithm Input: Gmax (maximum number of generations) Output: D Gmax+ 1 (final Pareto-optimal set) Step1: Initialization: Generate an initial qubit antibody Step2: Observing Operator: Generate classical antibody Step3: Update Dominant Population: Identify dominant an-Step4: Termination: If t  X  Gmax is satisfied, export D t +1 Step5: Generate active antibodies: If the size of D t is Record the corresponding qubit of A t to get qubit Step6: Cloning Operator : Get the qubit clone population Step7: Recombination update: Perform recombination update Step8: Get the qubit antibody population QB t by combining 
The major elements of QICMOA are presented as follows. 1. Observing Operator (namely classical representation). The process is described as follows: (a) generate a in '( ) Pt takes  X 1 X , otherwise it takes  X 0 X . 2. Cloning Operator the cloning operator T C on qubit active population QA is defined as: adaptive parameter, and tion. Then the values of i C are calculated as After clone, the population becomes: 
QC qc qc qc qc qc qc qc qc qc = (7) Where j i i qc qa = , 1, 2,..., chances to do search in less-crowded regions of the trade-off fronts. 3. Recombination Update 
In this paper, we use a new qubit representation, and perform cloning operator, re-combination update on corresponding qubit antibody population so as to improve the search efficiency. 
If ing to QC is defined as Where (,) i recom qc A denotes selecting one individual from the offspring generated from A . 
For the chaos character of qubit [10], we propose a new chaos update strategy on qubit clone antibody population QC (see equation 7) as follows. of guide q and  X  is the spread variance. Often we let [0.1, 0.5]  X   X  , [0.05, 0.15]  X   X  . 3.3 Computational Complexity of one generation for the algorithm can be calculated as follows: 
The time complexity for observing operation is ( ) DC ON N + ; the time complexity is ( ) C
ON . So the worst total time complexity is one generation for QICMOA can be simplified as the computational complexity of QICMOA. QICMOA in solving nine multiobjective 0/1 knapsack problems [9].The test data sets are consideration. 
In the following experiments, we performed 30 independent runs on each test prob-lem. Table 1 shows the direct comparison of QICMOA with SPEA, NSGA, VEGA and NPGA based on the performance metrics -Coverage. obtained by QICMOA in a certain extent weakly dominate the solutions obtained by SPEA and clearly weakly dominate the solutions obtained by NSGA, VEGA and NPGA, which indicates that the behavior of QICMOA is better than that of the other four algorithm for this test problem. Especially for 2 knapsacks with 500 items and with 750 items, all the other four algorithms' solutions are clearly weakly dominated by QICMOA's ones over 30 independent runs. For 3 knapsacks with 250 items, the nate the solutions obtained by SPEA and clearly weakly dominate the solutions ob-tained by NSGA, VEGA and NPGA. For 3 knapsacks with 500 items and 750 items, dominate the solutions obtained by the other four algorithms where for 3 knapsacks with 500 items all the NPGA's and VEGA's solutions are clearly weakly dominated by QICMOA's ones over 30 independent runs. For 4 knapsacks with 250 items, the lems. For 4 knapsacks with 500 items and 750 items, the results show that solutions tained by SPEA NSGA and weakly dominate the solutions obtained by VEGA and NPGA. In this paper, we have introduced a new multiobjective optimization algorithm-quan-tum-inspired immune clonal multiobjective optimization algorithm (QICMOA) to solve 0/1 knapsack problems. When compared with SPEA, NSGA, VEGA and popular metrics-Coverage.
