 Online health seeking has transformed the way of health knowledge exchange and reusability. The existing general and vertical health search engines, however, just routinely return lists of matched documents or question answer (QA) pairs, which may overwhelm the seekers or not sufficiently meet the seekers X  expectations. Instead, our multilingual system is able to return one multi-faceted answer that is well-structured and precisely extracted from multiple heterogeneous healthcare sources. Further, should the seekers not be satisfied with the returned search results, our system can automatically route the unsolved questions to the professionals with relevant expertise.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval-Search Process Healthcare, Vertical Search, Structured Knowledge, Social Platform
As health consumers take more control over managing their health, 72% of U.S. internet users have looked online for health information to improve their health, wellness and safety. This survey is conducted by the Pew Research Center in January 2013 1 . It also reports that 77% of online health seekers begin their exploration at commercial search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo. Another 13% explore special healthcare-oriented sites, such as WebMD and HealthTap. The remainders start search at social net-work or other non-mainstream retrieval forums. The seekers, however, are frequently overwhelmed by the returned vast quantity of unstructured information, i.e., lists of documents h ttp://pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Health-online.aspx Fi gure 1: Illustrative Architecture of our system.
Best Answer Selection WenZher supports multilingual search, so it first identifies the type of question language. It then locates the similar language-aware question by utilizing the syntactic tree structure approach [2]. The expert crafted answers of the first positioned question are returned.
Healthcare Topic Prediction To better capture the seman-tics of healthcare data and reduce the feature dimension, WenZher exploits the LDA-based topic-level features for data representation instead of traditional low-level n-gram features. Feeding the features into various classifiers, decision tree C4.5 achieves the best performance, slightly less than 90%, compared to Na  X   X ve Bayes, KNN and SVM.
Annotation with Terminologies Inspired by [1], WenZher codes each new question with medical terminologies that benefits cross-system operability and inter-user reusability. It first locally extracts the medical concepts from the ques-tion itself and maps them to terminologies in the external authenticated vocabularies, SNOMED-CT. Following that, it globally learns the terminologies from neighbors.
Question Routing Wenzher models the matching relations between given questions and doctors from the expertise and attitude, respectively. It then adaptively fuses these two factors via regression models.
WenZher is a social platform. It supports unidirectional connections among patients and experts, which naturally forms the tightly linked communities in terms of similar healthcare concerns, habits and practices. The latest posted questions and answers can be promptly updated and fed within each community, so users can learn key knowledge and offer advice via their personalized pages.

Before adding a new question, WenZher encourages users to perform vertical search over archived question-answer pairs, which is a policy to constrain duplicate questions. Figure 2 illustrates a comprehensive answer page for a given question. This page contains the best answer selected from multiple QA communities, organized knowledge from health provider released authoritative sources, as well as statistics from patient crowdsourcing forums.

WenZher allows users to post new questions, as shown in Figure 3. Here media documents can be uploaded to intuitively complement the question descriptions. In addi-
