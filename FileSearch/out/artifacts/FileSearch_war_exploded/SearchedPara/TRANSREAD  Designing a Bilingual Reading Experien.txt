 Owing to 15 years of advances in Statistical Ma-chine Translation (SMT), automatically translated texts are nowadays of sufficiently high quality to serve the general public and the translation industry. Contrary to (S)MT which primarily targets readers without any assumed literacy in the source language, the T RANS R EAD project studies applications target-ing partially bilingual users , such as language learn-ers, migrants settling in a new country, inhabitants of multilingual states, editors in the publishing industry and professional translators. Its main goal is to help such users to read texts in the original (source) lan-guage, even though a translation might be available in their mother tongue. Bitext processing techniques (Wu, 2010; Tiedemann, 2011) such as cross-lingual alignments at different levels or cross-lingual dictio-nary access, can facilitate and enrich the reading ex-perience of texts in their original language. Such endeavour poses difficult challenges: it first requires to push existing MT technologies to the limit and to revisit assumptions that are rarely questioned, such as the need to deliver fully aligned bitexts, including many-to-many sentence links, and to output high-precision word and phrase alignments , even for rare words or gappy multi-word units.

A second challenge is visualisation and interac-tion design. In fact, most existing interfaces for bilingual reading/writing have targeted specialists of the MT industry, serving purposes such as man-ual alignment input and visualisation (Smith and Jahry, 2000; Germann, 2008; Gilmanov et al., 2014; Steele and Specia, 2015), MT tracing and debug-ging (DeNeefe et al., 2005; Weese and Callison-Burch, 2010), MT quality assessment (Federmann, 2012; Chatzitheodorou, 2013; Girardi et al., 2014) or MT post-edition (Aziz et al., 2012). By con-trast, our aim is not just to visualize the transla-tion or bilingual correspondences, but rather to en-able a smooth and seamless reading experience for the general public. Ebook reading applications typ-ically allow the reader to select a word and to ac-cess the corresponding dictionary entry, but appli-cations that exploit the full translation context are much rarer. In DoppelText 1 , DuoLir 2 and Parallel Text Reader on iOS, the selection is performed at the sentence level, using alignments. Whatever level is used, this kind of switch-on-demand interaction interrupts the flow of reading and can be a source of frustration. Another approach uses synchronized views , where the bitext is shown to the reader along with alignment links. In ParallelBooks 3 , the bitext is synchronized by scrolling and the translation (at the paragraph level) only appears when the user taps the screen. Synchronized views have the potential to enable a seamless reading of the bitext (Pillias and Cubaud, 2015), at the cost however of a larger screen space. This paper discusses these various challenges and reports on the state of development of our main tool -the bilingual reader. Additional information, including resources and demos, can be found on the A major requirement of electronic reading devices is their ability to seamlessly reformat and adapt their typesetting, which does not only include the text it-self but also other editorial (header, footer), typo-graphic (bold, italic, font sizes and shapes) and dis-positional information. An early design choice was to include alignment information as auxiliary source of information to the original electronic book(s). Each side of the bitext is thus stored in the EPUB thereby enabling us to take advantage of its inher-ent ability to encode arbitrary documents and media files, as well as directives regarding their display.
Linguistic annotations are stored in an additional file to the EPUB archive and use an XML-based rep-proposed in the early 2000s to represent alignment information. References to actual textual units (in the EPUB/html files) are maintained as the com-plete path from the root of the document to the node containing the unit. Our format for represent-ing annotations is generic enough to represent align-ment links at various levels of granularity, as well as other arbitrary information. It relies on two types of basic markups: &lt;link&gt; for binary relationships (bilingual links or monolingual co-references), and &lt;mark&gt; for unary information concerning one sin-gle unit (be it a paragraph, a sentence, a fragment or a word). In our sample file, these tags are used to en-code part-of-speech as well as sense disambiguation information. However, only the information related to bilingual alignment links is currently displayed. Our representation of alignment relationships ac-commodates alignment links at various levels of granularity. Our display currently exploits 5 such levels, based on sentential, sub-sentential and word alignments, which were computed for two short sto-3.1 Sentence alignment Sentence alignment in parallel texts (bitexts) is a well established problem in multilingual NLP (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991; Kay and R  X  oscheisen, 1993), for which a wide array of methods exist (Tiedemann, 2011). The problem is however far from being solved, especially for lit-erary texts where parallelism is less strict than for technical or legal documents (Yu et al., 2012). For this demo, alignments have been produced semi-automatically. The automatic part used techniques presented by (Xu et al., 2015), which implement a multi-pass, coarse-to-fine alignment strategy. The first pass uses very reliable 1:1 alignment links com-puted using the approach of (Moore, 2002), while the next stages complete this initial partial alignment by including additional correspondences, the prob-abilities of which are evaluated using a large-scale MaxEnt classifier embarking a very large number of features. Automatic alignments were then manually checked and fixed: for our simple bitexts they were mostly correct, with a link level F-score  X  97%. 3.2 Word alignments For this demo, gold word alignments were collected as follows: automatic word alignments were first computed by running the MGiza (Gao and Vogel, 2008) implementation of IBM Model 4 (Brown et al., 1993) in both directions. Alignments in the in-tersection were checked and corrected following the recommandations of Och and Ney (2003). Even for such simple texts, alignment errors were numerous, with an AER close to 0.17 ( X  X he Promise X ), and to 0.19 ( X  X he Verger X ). This confirms the intuition that computing high quality word alignments for liter-ary texts might be significantly more difficult than for other text genres. This also calls for improved techniques for computing confidence measures for word alignments (Huang, 2009): depending on the intended reading context, it might be better to avoid displaying erroneous alignment links. 3.3 Subsentential alignments The task of designing sound and tractable align-ment models is notoriously much harder for groups of words than for words (Marcu and Wong, 2002; DeNero and Klein, 2008). Two main strategies have been explored in the literature: the most common, employed in most SMT systems (Koehn et al., 2007) starts with alignments for isolated words, which are incrementally grown subject to consistency con-straints. The alternative way is to start with senten-tial alignments and adopt a divisive strategy, which yields progressive refinements of an initially holis-tic pairing; this can be performed exactly under ITG constraints (Wu, 1997); heuristic approaches, capa-ble of handling alignments for arbitrarily long seg-ments have also been proposed in (Lardilleux et al., 2012): both techniques require to evaluate the par-allelism of arbitrary chunks. We follow the latter here, also using punctuation marks to select segmen-tation points. The resulting alignments are deliber-ately pretty coarse and primarily meant to be used in a contrastive condition for the human tests. 4.1 Design The current version of the T RANS R EAD bilingual reader displays paginated versions of the bitext in parallel views. In Figure 1, the source text is dis-played on the right side of the screen and its transla-tion on the left. The user has selected a word in the source version. Touching a word highlights its con-text on both sides, exploiting the alignment structure in a hierarchical way. Highlighting can be triggered from both versions of the text. The different lev-els are depicted using bounding boxes, which are pre-computed using the alignment and the HTML graphs. Bounding boxes are not always rectangular, because of word hyphenation for text justification. We have tried to minimize visual overload by simpli-fying the resulting geometry of the boxes and using a colour scale as background. We use the  X  X atural X  theme from (Krause, 2010).

The display size for the bitext can be modified dy-namically. When the application starts, the text ver-sions are given an equal space, but the translation on the left can be shrunk so that the reader can concen-trate on the original text. Structural highlighting is still functional in this mode, but when the translated text is shrunk to its minimum size, it can only be used as a visual hint.
 Our reader is targeted for use on a tablet device. Interactions with the tactile screen of the tablet cause the well-known problem of fingers occluding the touched item. To avoid this issue, a pointer is dis-played 1.3cm above the touch position sensed by the system, and its position determines what ele-ments are selected. This picking is done by recur-sively searching the textual elements whose precom-puted bounding boxes contain the pointer X  X  position. When this process selects two sibling elements (e.g. two sentences in a paragraph), the system only keeps the one for which the distance from the pointer to the closest bounding box border is greatest. The pointer shape is an upward triangle. When a word is se-lected, we also display a downward triangle above it attached to the line of text, but following the pointer horizontally. These two triangles enclose the se-lected word without occluding it. 4.2 Implementation As readers, we benefit from centuries of high quality printed typesetting. A poor digital typesetting would therefore lower the user experience of our bilingual reader, no matter how rich the interaction may be. But automated typesetting is a complex task, of-ten under-estimated. For instance, justification on small columns, as those produced by bitext presen-tation, can exhibit  X  X ivers X  of white space that are difficult to handle automatically. Our first goal for the implementation was then to select a program-ming framework that would help for these questions. other important issue was to build a fully reconfig-urable software in order to investigate a large de-sign space of interaction for tablets. We have se-lected the Kivy framework for Python, which en-ables cross-platform development for Android or iOS, and GPU-based graphics with OpenGL ES. As reflected in this paper, a top priority is to pur-sue our efforts towards high-precision alignments, an application where supervised learning techniques could help (Moore, 2005). Additional functionali-ties in reading are also envisioned, such as an en-hanced and non-distracting access to dictionary in-formation for difficult words. Currently, Web Read-ers and mobile reading devices offer such function-ality through a pop-up window presenting the com-plete dictionary entry. No assistance is however of-fered to access the right sense in context, which would be especially helpful for polysemous words or when language proficiency is low. In T RAN -
R EAD , we propose to perform this selection auto-matically. Our word sense disambiguation (WSD) method (Apidianaki and Gong, 2015) exploits word-level alignments to annotate words on both sides of the bitext with the correct senses extracted from BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012). By in-tegrating WSD information in the reader, we will be able to propose definitions, usage examples and Wikipedia entries, as well as synonymous words and semantically correct translations. Our WSD system embeds an alignment-based multi-word expression (MWE) identification mechanism (Marie and Apid-ianaki, 2015). Such information will serve as part of a smart selection mechanism (Pantel et al., 2014), enabling the system to select appropriate spans and dictionary entries for MWEs found in texts.

An experimental evaluation of the interface gen-eral design is currently being conducted. We study, notably, the effect of the depth of the alignment structure on human readers behavior. As short term future work, we shall also investigate other inter-action techniques for focus management, such as distortion and 3D views for page turning (Cubaud, 2008). The graphic composition engine developed for the current application already allows such ef-fects. A research agenda should also include long term experiments with real-life reading sessions for a wide range of languages and text difficulties. We have presented a first version of a bilingual reader using NLP and HCI technologies to enhance the reading experience. On our way, some tough challenges had to be overcome, an unexpected issue being the processing of typeset documents which is hardly addressed in the NLP literature. This venture has provided a context where such issues matter, il-lustrating the benefits of cross-domain research. This work was partly funded by the French  X  X a-tional Research Agency X  under project ANR-12-CORD-0015.
