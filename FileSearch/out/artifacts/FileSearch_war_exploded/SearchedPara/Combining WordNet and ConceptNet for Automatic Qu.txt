Chen QIDF the logarithm of inverse document frequency (IDF) of q i for q i  X  Q QMPS the maximum possible retrieval score of returned documents for Q QMXS the retrieval score of document with rank 1 in the initial result of Q
QNS the number of senses of q i in WordNet, for q i QNT the number of query terms, i.e., | Q | 
QPS the probability of q i being its first sense for q i
CACR the average of co-occurrence correlations between e k and q i for q i
CCOR the co-occurrence correlation between e k and q i , i.e., COR ( e k , q i ) for q i CCRK rank of e k in the spreading activation of Q in ConceptNet CCSA score of e k in the spreading activation of Q in ConceptNet CIDF logarithm of IDF of the candidate term e k CMPS the maximum possible retrieval scores for Q expanded by e k with the two weights 
CMXS the retrieval scores of documents ranked 1 in retrieved results for Q expanded by CNS the number of senses of e k in WordNet CPS the probability of e k being its first sense CWRK rank of e k in the spreading activation of Q in WordNet 
CWSA score of e k in the spreading activation of Q in WordNet average distance between t 1 and t 2 is (|35-5|  X  |35-66|  X  |102-173|)/3  X  44. 220 M.-H. Hsu, M.-F. Tsai, and H.-H. Chen Table 4.
