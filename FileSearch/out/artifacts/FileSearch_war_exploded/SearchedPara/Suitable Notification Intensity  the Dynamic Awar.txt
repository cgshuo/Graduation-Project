 Being aware of others X  activities has played a vital role in the success of online collaboration. This resulted in the emergence of many groupware systems that provide users with information about the activities of their collaborators in various manners. In overburdened by large amounts of unnecessary activity information. This happens because users are most of the time only interested in certain pieces of information for limited durations, while presently there exist no efficient mechanisms for automatically following a user X  X  focus and adjusting the information flow directed at her/hi m. In this paper we present as a practical solution to this critical problem the dynamic awareness system, which extends the functionality of the BSCW shared workspace system. Key element of the dynamic awareness system is its rule-based inference mech anism to adjust the notification intensity, which reduces the info rmation overload and indirectly manage more efficiently large am ounts of shared information. We tested the effectiveness of the dynamic awareness system under real-life circumstances and describe the evaluation results. H.4.1 [ Office Automation ]: Groupware. H.5.3 [ Group and Organization Interfaces ]: Collaborative Computing, Computer-supported cooperative work. Algorithms, Experimenta tion, Human Factors. Task awareness, dynamic notification, shared workspace. Nowadays, people working in different areas often use shared workspaces to collaborate and interact with each other, especially when they are dispersed throughout different physical locations. Shared workspaces mainly support users to share electronic documents, media data and also ot her resources. Within a shared workspace, people can work together without sensing time and space differences. To achieve this, awareness information plays a significant role within the collaboration environment. Group awareness is the understanding of who is working with you, what the others are doing, and how your own actions interact with theirs [5]. In shared wo rkspaces, workspace awareness is one of the most important features, which helps users to be aware of who is doing what in which workspaces. To make it convenient, users can specify in advance what kind of information they are interested in, and also how they want to be informed of all the information. In this way, users can stay aware by getting notifications about the occurren ce of certain events without frequently checking the event history of their workspaces. Prinz [11] identified two types of awareness: social awareness and task-oriented awareness. Social awareness refers to being aware of the presence and activities of users. By contrast, task-oriented awareness refers to being aware of the contributor and activities of tasks, e.g. being aware of the occurrence of certain tasks. Within this paper, we will only address issues related to task-oriented awareness. As stated above, to activate the awareness function within existing shared workspace applications, users can only specify manually what events they are interested in. However, people usually forget to update their awareness profiles in order to change their awareness focus. This kind of situation results in that people will keep getting notified about certain pieces of information, which they are no longer interested in. Therefore, we propose a new concept, which keeps people always staying aware of information related to their present focuses. This concept models how awareness profiles can be configured dynamically in order to better fit the current situation of users. The implemented dynamic awareness system, an extension of the BSCW shared workspace system, can sense the users X  focus based on his/her present work and correspondingly update the awareness profiles within their workspaces. In order to test the system we asked several colleagues to install the dynamic awareness system and use it together with the main BSCW server of our institute. These users received then modified daily reports and/or alerts depe nding on the chosen rules and their focus of work, i.e. they could directly see an effect of the dynamic awareness system. The users provided us with an evaluation of the initial set of rules for a dynamic awareness system and our work raises several issues for de signer to consider when building awareness mechanisms fo r groupware systems. In [2], the authors studied computer activity information, including the activity of keyboard/mouse and the activity of reading and sending emails. They discovered a number of temporally rhythmic patterns in the users X  activity records, which can potentially be exploited by applications to help support remote coordination and communica tion. Similarly, in shared workspaces there exist related patterns, which represent the variation of the users X  awareness focus. Such patterns can be identified to define rules for dynamic awareness updating, and will be used later on as the implementation foundation of the proposed dynamic awareness system. Our research could contribute to the work of Gutwin and Greenberg on workspace awareness [8] and emphasize especially the contextual and dynamic nature of helpful notifications; see also Gross and Prinz [7]. In the Information Lens system Mackay and her colleagues [10] proved successfully that people without significant computer experience are able to create and use rules effectively to sort, select, and filter their messages. FeedMe, a collaborative alert f iltering prototoype [13], uses machine learning to infer alert preferences based on user feedback. Our work differs in se veral respects: First, we do not integrate direct users feedback on notifications. Second, we incorporate other users X  behavior to decide on notifications. Now, we shortly compare several well-known groupware systems and research prototypes together with the awareness techniques implemented within each system. Table 1 presents an overview of the different implementations of awareness services for groupware systems, as well as the corresponding configuration mechanism for awareness profiles. Table 1. Comparison of awaren ess mechanisms among several As seen in Table 1, most of the groupware systems implement both social awareness and task-oriented awareness. Social awareness is usually achieved by the realization of presence awareness, which indicates the current status of users (online/offline). In comparison, task-oriented awareness has been implemented in more varied ways. Most significantly, all systems have the same mechanism for conf iguring the awareness profiles: users do this manually. In summary, state-of-the-art gr oupware systems require users to manually specify their awareness profiles, including what events they are interested in, and how they can get notified of these events. This is the case although real-life workspaces can vary a lot among different time periods. So me usual reasons for this high variance can be, for example, the finalization of the previous work and/or the start of a new project. Most commonly, people forget to update the specification of their awareness profiles in order to change their awareness focus. This kind of situation results in that people will keep getting notified about events that they are no longer interested in, or they will miss information. Concerning the problem stated above, the solution could be a tool, which can automatically and dynamically update the users X  awareness profiles according to their current focus on shared workspaces. This tool should sense the users X  focus based on his/her present work and correspondingly update the awareness profiles of their workspaces. awareness profiles should be clearly defined, including when to update, what to update and how to update. The first step of the requirements analysis was to study on the corresponding awareness profiles in BSCW shared workspaces. The history data used for require ments analysis consisted of two-month (January and February 2006) event logs from a BSCW server, which serves more than hundred thousands of workspaces for thousands of users. These da ta contain the complete activity relevant general information. The intent of the event log analys is was to find relations between activity and awareness profiles, more specifically, in what kind of situations a user updated the specification of his awareness profiles. After carefully studying the data, a few possible situations have been discovered as follows: Note that the identified situations above are all hypotheses because the data in event logs did not provide complete information about the happening events. Figure 1 shows an example of the data in event logs, illustrating the incompleteness of the information. To protect the privacy of the user, the real username has been replaced by John Smith. Figure 1. Extract of event log rel ated to actions of John.Smith. As can be seen from Figure 1, John has created a new workspace (event name: addfol) on January 30th, 2006 at 12:13 inside the workspace whose ID is 33406387. Immediately after the creation, he accessed the new workspace (event name: get), whose ID is 36723880, invited some members to this workspace (event name: addmember) and at the end changed the awareness profiles of this workspace (event name: chawpref). It is natural to think that the newly created workspace has the ID 36723880, and all the actions were performed on this new workspace. Moreover, it also proves the credibility of one of the po ssible situations: users like to change the awareness profile of the workspace shortly after the creation of the workspace. Nevertheless, from the first record in the depicted event log (creation of the workspace), we are unable to observe the actual ID of the created workspace. Such incomplete information is encount ered in many other situations, making the use of simila r hypotheses unavoidable. Figure 2 presents another example of the event logs from the BSCW server and the user names are changed as in Figure 1 due to privacy issues. From the event log, we can see that Alice has invited a new member to the workspace with ID 36716217 on January 30th, 2006 at 14:29. At 14.32 Bob accessed the same workspace and at 15.13 he changed his event filter for the respective workspace. It is natural to assume that the new member Alice invited was Bob. If this assumption holds, then another possible typical situation can be observed. The new situation depicts the fact that most users like to change the awareness profile of a workspace shortly after they join the respective workspace. Since the awareness-related patterns cannot be identified beyond doubt from the existing data in the event logs, a questionnaire was created and used in order to get more detailed information directly from users. The questions inside the questionnaire were formulated based on the hypothe ses, formed during the data analysis phase. This questionnaire was intended at gathering information about how BSCW users interact with their workspaces by means of the awareness functionality built into the server. The questionnaire was published on an internal BSCW server as an electronic poll and totally 20 people were invited to fill out the questionnaire. It started on June 30th 2006 and ended on 8th August 2006 with the duration of 40 days. The participants can be divided into two groups: IT experts working in our institute and students from the university. Every IT expert has at least one hundred workspaces and has already worked with the BSCW server for at least five years. Some of the experts have been involved in developing the BSCW system. The other group of participants consists of students, who has on average less workspaces and also works less with the BSCW system. From the questionnaire we obtained that people forget to update the specification of their awareness profiles in order to change their awareness focus. More than the half set up the awareness profile once and never update it. The result of the questionnaire supported the following rules about updating awareness profile s. More information about activities was wanted when one of the following rules applied: There are two more rules incorporating activities of other users. More information about activities was wanted: If one of the rules applied, the respective shared workspace is called  X  X ctive X  otherwise it is called  X  X nactive X . Less information about activities was wanted: The result of the questionnaire supported the following default values for notification mechanisms according to  X  X wareness levels X : In conclusion, solely using either the data analysis or the questionnaire is not an ideal way for defining the awareness patterns. On one hand, although by analyzing the event logs the activities of more users can be observed and studied, the incompleteness of the activity information cannot support discovering the reason why users change their awareness profiles. On the other hand, the questionnaire is a more direct way to get detailed information and practical opinions from users, but the combination of log data analysis and a questionnaire was employed. Data analysis proposed some possible awareness patterns based on event logs and the questionnaire asked users to judge the authenticity of these patterns according to their practical experience. There are three different awareness levels  X  X igh X ,  X  X iddle X , and  X  X ow X , there is the distincti on between  X  X ctive X  and  X  X nactive X  shared workspaces, and there is a set of rules, which change active shared workspaces to inactive shared workspaces and vice versa. Each awareness level illustrates the extent of the interest that the user has in the events happening in the respective workspace. For example, if the user chooses the high level as the awareness level for one workspace, that means he/she desires to be highly aware of activities inside the selected workspace. Therefore, more notification methods are used in the high level to make sure that the user can get immediate and complete notifications when certain activities happen. The main purpose of dividing workspaces into active and inactive ones is that after this division active and inactive workspaces can be treated differently with regard to the awareness level. In other words, the user can choose differe nt awareness levels for active workspaces and inactive workspaces. Under normal circumstances, the awareness le vel of active workspaces should be higher than that of inactive workspaces. In this way, a user is able to pay more attention to active workspaces than to inactive ones. Similarly, the user can avoid receiving unnecessary notifications from inactive workspaces by selecting the low awareness level for inactive workspaces. The set of rules is represented in XML format and contains all the rules configured by using the user interface. For example, rule (3) describes how the respective event filters will be reconfigured when a document is uploaded either by the user itself or another user. Figure 3 shows how rule (3) is stored in  X  X ules.xml X  file. The interplay of the different con cepts in a process is shown in Figure 4. Assume that users are collaborating with a groupware system. Their activities generate events. Once the dynamic occurred in the shared workspaces since the last time the application was used. The retrieved events come from all shared workspaces of the user on a certain BSCW server. Afterwards, the application will select any certain categories of events as being of interest, for example upload events, new member join events, calendar event, etc. The interesting events are selected according to the rule definitions from the  X  X ules X  file , and only these events will be later processed. During the even t processing, the application checks the interesting events happening in a certain shared workspace and the current status (active/inactive) and awareness level of the respective shared workspace. It then can be decided, based on the rules, whether it is necessary to modify the current settings of the awareness profile of the shared workspace. When the necessity exists, the appli cation will send a message to the BSCW server to perform the a ppropriate modification(s) on the corresponding awareness profile. After that the user will be notified according to their awareness level setting for active and inactive workspaces. Apart from the events, the dynamic awareness system also retrieves certain workspace-related information from the BSCW server. Such information includes the time when the workspace has been last accessed, the number of workspace members actively working within it and the names (IDs) of the respective members. As in the case of the retrieved events, the workspace information helps with modifying inappropriate settings within the event filters. The settings ar e updated when the information matches any rule for updating event filters. The dynamic awareness system is built as a client application for BSCW servers using the client/server architecture. Figure 4 presents the system architecture of the DAS client application and shows the flow of information. The client application is deve loped as a stand-alone Java application by using the Java 2 Platform Standard Edition Software Development Kit (J2SDK) version 1.4.2_11. All related files including the  X  X ules X  file and  X  X orkspaceInfo X  file are stored in XML format. For pars ing and manipulating XML files, the application uses the open s ource XML parser Xerces-J 2.6.0 developed by Apache. The Java Web Services Developer Pack (Java WSDP) 1.6 is installed and one library archive (jaxp-api.jar) from this package is used by the application. Furthermore, for connecting to the remote BSCW server via the X-BSCW API, the application uses Apache XML-RP C 1.2-b1 library, which is a Java implementation of th e XML-RPC specification. To run the application, the only requirement is an existing Java Runtime Environment (JRE) at the client side. Since the application is still in test pha se, no scheduling software was installed to cooperate with the a pplication. In principle however, almost any current scheduling soft ware should be suitable for this purpose. In this section, the user interface of the client application is presented. For an easier handling, the functionalities are logically grouped into tabs, which represent the main components of the application X  X  graphical user interface. The presentation will follow the tabular structure and focus on each tab in turn. In the  X  X elcome X  pane the user is asked to input the password for logging onto a certain BSCW server. In the  X  X wareness Level Settings X  pane (see Figure 6), users choose the notification methods for each awareness level. Each events happening in the respective workspace. For example, if the user chooses the high level as the awareness level for one workspace, that means he/she desires to be highly aware of interesting events happening inside the selected workspace. Therefore, more notification methods are used in the high level to make sure that the user can get immediate and complete notifications when certain events occur. In the  X  X utomatic Update Settings  X  pane the awareness level for active and inactive shared worksp aces is set by two groups of radio buttons. The  X  X pload Settings X  pane (see Figure 7) provides the user interface for the configuration of rule 3. As specified in the rule, if a new document is uploaded into an inactive workspace, the status of the workspace will be changed to active. This tab also allows a user to subscribe his/her interest on certain event(s) occurring to the newly uploaded document, as well as his/her interval of interest. Because the user may have different interests on the documents uploaded by him/he r, as opposed to documents uploaded by other members of the workspace, the interesting events and the interval of interest can be separately selected for these tow document categories. The  X  X eeting &amp; Project Settings X  pane provides a user interface for the configuration of rule (4) and (5). The  X  X ember Settings X  pane (see Figure 8) provides an interface for the configuration of rule (2), (6), and (7). These three rules are all member-oriented because of their focus on the activities of certain members inside the workspace. In the  X  X orkspace Information X  pane, users can retrieve work-space information from the BSCW server and edit the awareness-related information for each workspace, e.g. select favorite users. We used the field method to evaluate the dynamic awareness system [14], i.e. six BSCW user s were invited to evaluate the dynamic awareness system in their real collaborative work environment. All evaluators are cu rrently working in our institute, and have a fairly large number of workspaces and play different roles in different workspaces. Before the official start of the evaluation, all six evaluators have been given an overview of the underlying concepts and the usage of a variety of functionalities of the dynamic awareness system. Considering the fact that the evaluators require a period of two days to three days to become familiar with the functionalities before the actual use of the application, the entire duration of the evaluation was three weeks. Moreover, the evaluators were provided with a list of tutorial tasks that they were supposed to accomplish in their real working contexts, see Table 2. In the "Awareness Level Settings" pane, change the settings for the different awareness levels. Then, (a) Change the awareness level for a workspace in "Workspace (b) When some of your workspaces have been changed to In the "Automatic Update Setti ngs" pane, change the number of days for "Inactive Workspace". In the "Upload Settings" pane, change the settings for the days and the interesting events. Th en, upload a document into an inactive workspace, and check if the workspace has been changed to active and if you receive the direct email notifications about the specified events during the specified time interval. To use the functions in the "Meeting &amp; Project Settings" pane, you should first create one or more BSCW group calendars and then add appointments into the calendar. (a) To use the notification for "Meeting", please add the (b) To use the notification for "Project Deadline", please add the (c) To use the notification for "Project Prototypes", please add (d) To use the notification for "Project Presentations", please Check if the workspace, with the group calendar inside, is changed to active, when any event described above is coming.

(d) Select any workspace and then click "Edit". Edit the settings (e) Select any workspace and then click "to BSCW". Check if After the three-week evaluation interval, the six evaluators were evaluation results/feedbacks. The questionnaire was created as an online electronic poll. Five evaluators filled out the questionnaire, whereas the sixth evaluator did not fill out the questionnaire but provided written comments and suggestions on the dynamic awareness system. The online questionnaire allowed for additional comments to each question. We present a few of them: The results of the evaluation questionnaire can be summarized as follows. During the evaluation process: The following table shows the average scores for each pane with regard to understandability of the underlying concepts and their usefulness; the scores range from  X 1 X  high to  X 5 X  low. The dynamic awareness system was tested successfully, i.e. the hypothetical rules for changing the awareness profile could be validated. Table 3. Average scores for understandability and usefulness. Our evaluation has several limitati ons. First, there were only six participants in our study group and the study was only three weeks long, i.e. each participant received at maximum 21  X  X odified X  daily reports and a numbe r of  X  X odified X  direct alerts. The number of different work rhythms within the projects of the users may be too small to allow generalization of the results. Second, our rules are an initial set for extending awareness mechanisms, so there is a need to test different rule sets and their usefulness. In this paper we have introduced the dynamic awareness system. The evaluation results have shown that the dynamic awareness system has successfully accomplished its goal: automatically updating the awareness profiles of users according to their current working context. The application ensures that users do not receive any unnecessary notification about events happening inside formerly interesting workspaces. In this way, users are able to better focus on his/her present work and are much less likely to miss any approaching meeting or appointment. It is important to note that, since the purpose of the proposed system was to test the unde rlying rules providing dynamic awareness, its execution speed was not considered to be of prime importance. In spite of this issue, the testers provided positive feedback and considered that such a system, which can appropriately change their awareness profiles to meet their present needs inside the owned wo rkspaces, can be very helpful in the collaborative working environment. It is clear that in the future there is more to learn about the underlying patterns that represent th e relations between the users X  activities inside the shared workspaces and the corresponding variation of the users X  awareness focus. By applying the explored underlying patterns appropriately, the users X  awareness focus can be constantly and properly updated by the groupware system that possesses dynamic awareness func tionalities. Moreover, the ideal way to implement dynamic awareness services is to implement it inside the groupware system as a core component, with the same importance as the functionality of file sharing, for example. In this way, the dynamic awareness kernel can locally retrieve the events and workspace information from the database of the groupware system, thus greatly im proving runtime efficiency of the system. Additionally, in the case of the BSCW server, the execution of an internal dynami c awareness component can easily be scheduled so as to avoid the n ecessity of any user intervention. Finally, we believe that dynamic awareness profiles play a critical role in the field of CSCW, due to its high potential in helping people collaborate more efficiently and flexibly, based on continuous and up-to-date awaren ess information about others X  activities. We would like to thank the members of the FIT.CSCW research division who supported the development of the dynamic awareness system. [1] Appelt, W.
