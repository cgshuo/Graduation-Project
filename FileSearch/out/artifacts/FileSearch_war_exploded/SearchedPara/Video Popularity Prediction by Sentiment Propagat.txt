 Video popularity prediction plays a foundational role in many aspects of life, such as recommendation systems and invest-ment consulting. Because of its technological and economic importance, this problem has been extensively studied for years. However, four constraints have limited most related works X  usability. First, most feature oriented models are inadequate in the social media environment, because many videos are published with no specific content features, such as a strong cast or a famous script. Second, many studies assume that there is a linear correlation existing between view counts from early and later days, but this is not the case in every scenario. Third, numerous works just take view counts into consideration, but discount associated sen-timents. Nevertheless, it is the public opinions that directly drive a video X  X  final success/failure. Also, many related ap-proaches rely on a network topology, but such topologies are unavailable in many situations. Here, we propose a Dual Sentimental Hawkes Process (DSHP) to cope with all the problems above. DSHP X  X  innovations are reflected in three ways: (1) it breaks the  X  X inear Correlation X  assumption, and implements Hawkes Process; (2) it reveals deeper fac-tors that affect a video X  X  popularity; and (3) it is topology free. We evaluate DSHP on four types of videos: Movies, TV Episodes, Music Videos, and Online News, and compare its performance against 6 widely used models, including Trans-lation Model, Multiple Linear Regression, KNN Regression, ARMA, Reinforced Poisson Process, and Univariate Hawkes Process. Our model outperforms all of the others, which in-dicates a promising application prospect.

Videos are everywhere. Because they facilitate a complete visual connection and help a strong emotional communica-tion, videos are becoming a preferred carrier for information exchanging online. According to statistics, 75 million U.S. Internet users watch videos online every day, and by 2016, videos will drive 55% of all consumer traffic worldwide However, users X  attention is not symmetrically distributed among all videos. Only a few of them can attract massive attention, and the rest will be left to languish. Thus, an ability to predict the potential popularity of a video may facilitate the design and management of a wide range of systems or services, such as recommendation systems and targeted advertising[23]. Although popularity modeling and predicting has been deeply and extensively explored over decades, several constraints make most of them inefficient for a wide range of applications.

Feature oriented methods are ineffective for many user generated videos. Over the last century, methods, like Lin-ear Regression and Neural Network , have achieved great suc-cess in movies X  box office predictions[12, 13], but they could not fit all videos well. Many videos, especially the ones generated by ordinary users, have no significant content fea-tures(e.g. strong cast, famous scripts or specific genres) for such methods to work. http://digitalmunch.tv/importance-of-video-to-promote-your-brand/
Purely count derivation oriented methods could not pro-vide an insight about the mechanisms that drive a video X  X  popularity. In many cases, we want to know not only which videos will be popular, but also why they could be popu-lar. Since Meeyoung-Cha et al.[3] claimed that a YouTube video X  X  popularity is mostly determined by its early view counts, a great number of regression or classification ex-tended approaches[23, 26, 30, 21, 9, 24, 33] have been built. These models aim to simulate the accrual of early views and/or vote counts, and then predict the long-term dynam-ics. But, such methods fail to reveal the underlying factors that make a video X  X  success. In addition, this  X  X inear Cor-relation X  assumption on the view counts between early and later days has been challenged by Haito-Li et al.[15], when they explored another social media platform. We also find a noticeable lower correlation between the view counts on early and later days. Figure 1 presents four videos X  view evolutions from douban.com 2 . From the views of early days, Video B shows a much more promising potential than Video A, but actually Video A has a more successful outcome than Video B.

Most network-dynamics-oriented studies rely on network topologies 3 [15, 14, 6, 2, 27]. Based on a topology, they sim-ulate the  X  X ord of mouth X  process to predict each video X  X  final popularity. However, there are several challenges in real applications. First, it turns out to be very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain a complete network. Many re-searchers have to conduct experiments on an incomplete or simulated network; approximation will bring unavoidable inaccuracies. Second, in many scenarios, networks are im-plicit or even unknown[31]; we can only observe who watches a video, but cannot know from where/whom he/she hears about it. In addition, a video X  X  popularity results not only from the  X  X ord of mouth X  process, but also from many other influences, such as a video X  X  promotions. A friend X  X  rec-ommendation as well as an attractive billboard could be the reason that makes one watch a video. Obviously, the network-dynamics-oriented methods do not take the latter factor into consideration.

The  X  X omogeneous Node X  assumption is implied in other related research, but it has overlooked the importance of sentiments in the real world. However, it is the public X  X  opinions that often determine a video X  X  success. Intuitively, positive comments will trigger more future views, while neg-ative ones will discourage potential audiences. Taking Fig-ure 1 as an example, although Video B seems to be more appealing at the beginning, its overwhelming negative criti-cism has already indicated a rapid decline in its view count. On the contrary, despite the initial dissatisfaction, Video A X  X  preponderant positive feedback foresees its future suc-cess. Moreover, sentiments will reveal more interesting in-sights about a video. Video C receives a lot of favorable comments at the beginning, but the devastating negative feedback comes quickly in great numbers later on; Video D seems to be very unpromising at first, but it gains a bet-ter reputation over time. The specific reasons how people change their attitude towards a video go beyond the scope of this paper, but this is really inspiring for sociologists and related researchers to explore. http://www.douban.com/. It is a popular website for users to exchange opinions about videos and books in China the way in which constituent nodes are interrelated or ar-ranged Figure 1: Evolution Patterns of Four Videos from Douban.

In our study, we build a Dual Sentimental Hawkes Pro-cess(DSHP) to model videos X  watching propagation dynam-ics. Compared to other related works, DSHP could provide more insightful perspectives and more explanatory results. Generally speaking, this paper has three contributions: (1) It builds a novel model, DSHP, for video popularity prediction. DSHP has achieved even better performances compared to Multiple Linear Regression, KNN Regression, Autoregressive Moving Average Model, and Reinforced Pois-son Process, which are currently the most popular and widely used models. (2) DSHP reveals more detailed underlying patterns and mechanisms that drive a video X  X  final success. This paper has analyzed various factors( Exogenous Impact , Endogenous Impact , Sentiment Impact and Sentiment Transfer Pattern Impact ) to conclude their influences on a video X  X  popularity propagation. (3) We use four important types of videos: Movies, TV Episodes, Music Videos, and Online News, to examine DSHP. We have detected their respective propagation characteris-tics. In addition, we have constructed four sub-datasets: Eli-tist Movies, Popcorn Movies, Niche Movies, and Flop Movies from the movie dataset. Based on these sub-datasets, we im-plement DSHP on each of them, and have found the essential factors which make a movie X  X  popularity.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We intro-duce some related research in Section 2. Section 3 elaborates DSHP X  X  work mechanisms. Section 4 presents our experi-ment and evaluation details. We conclude in Section 5.
Popularity prediction is a vast research domain, and has attracted research interests from many fields. Just as men-tioned above, even though various theories and models have been proposed [23, 12, 13, 3, 26, 30, 21, 9, 24, 33, 15, 14, 6, 2, 27], improvement is still needed. The most similar studies to our model are the implicit network propagation approaches, which imply the epidemiological process in information dif-fusion simulation. SIS and SIR are two seminal prototypes in related studies[19, 20]. Both of SIS and SIR classify the nodes into different types, and focus on the evolution of the proportions of nodes in each class[8]. In SIS and SIR, S stands for Susceptible , I stands for Infectious , and R stands for Recovered . In SIR, S class nodes have a fixed probability  X  to switch to class I , and I class nodes have a fixed prob-ability  X  to switch to class R , while in SIS, I class nodes have a fixed probability  X  to switch back to class S . How-ever, both of these models have a very strong assumption (fixed value) about the influence parameters, while in a real social network, influence will not be evenly distributed.
Jiqiang-Wu et al.[29] extend SIR to model two hidden processes embedded in a popularity dynamic process, In-formation Spreading Process and User Reaction Process , to capture the important underlying factors that drive an indi-vidual video X  X  popularity. However, this work still inherits the fixed parameter assumption from SIR. In addition, it only makes a theoretical exploration and is hard to be di-rectly used in a practical scenario.

Yang et al.[31] relaxes the fixed parameter assumption by constructing time-dependent influence functions for each node. They have developed a LIM (Linear Influence Model) to simulate the dynamic information diffusion processes, and the number of activated nodes in each time episode is af-fected by the sum of influences coming from the previous activated nodes. The influence functions are represented in a non-parametric way, breaking the fixed parameter assump-tion in SIS and SIR. But the assumption that all nodes are homogeneously activated has undermined the ability of this model.
 Hua-Wei Shen et al.[25] proposes a Reinforced Poisson Process to predict popularity. By implementing a tempo-ral relaxation function corresponding to agings in attracting new attention, and a reinforcement mechanism document-ing the well-known  X  X ich get richer X  phenomenon, their study achieves flexibility and a strong ability to model popularity dynamics. However, it is really a challenge to use a single Poisson process to model a complicated situation.

Riley and Didier[4] first claim that both exogenous and en-dogenous are two important ingredients that function in so-cial network information propagation. They have introduced a self-excited Hawkes process to model popularity dynamics, and proved that the Hawkes process has a promising predic-tive power. Inspired by this work, many derivative models have been proposed in recent years to solve various problems in social media[17, 32, 16, 34, 1]. Most models just imple-ment a single self-excited Hawkes process, while the real world is too complicated to be comprehensively represented by a single process
This paper also implements Hawkes process as the funda-mental framework to predict videos X  popularity. In this pa-per, we propose a Dual Sentimental Hawkes Process(DSHP) to solve the problems in existing popularity prediction stud-ies. Compared to previous works, the strengths of DSHP are: (1) it enables time-varying infection strength; (2) it models the interaction between inhomogeneous nodes; and (3) it takes various possible influential factors into consider-ation.
In this part, we first define precisely three factors con-tributing to our model, namely Exogenous Impact , Endoge-nous Impact , and Sentiment . Then we will formally state our problem definition and model description.

Exogenous Impact or Immigrant Impact denotes the factor that is not affected by the  X  Word of Mouth  X  process, such as the stars X  effect or a video X  X  trailers. For example, if one is a big fan of Beyonce , he/she will watch everyone of her music videos spontaneously without any previous influences from his/her social network.

Endogenous Impact denotes the factor that is affected by the  X  Word of Mouth  X  process. For example, it is highly likely for a user to watch a video that is strongly recommended by his/her friends.

Sentiment denotes the factor that reflects users X  attitude towards a video. In this paper, we range the sentiment in { 1 , 2 } , where  X 1 X  indicates a Positive attitude, and  X 2 X  indi-cates a Negative attitude. Clearly, sentiment could be either inferred from comments or expressed via thumbs up or down of a video.

Now let us consider a typical scenario where n watchers choose to watch a video v , and these n watchers come in a sequence of { t i } ( t i  X  1  X  t i , and i  X  [1 ,n ]), where t the time stamp when watcher i views the video. These n watchers are intrigued by either the exogenous impact or the endogenous impact. After viewing this video, an individual i might have a sentiment s i ( i  X  [1 ,n ], and s i  X  X  1 , 2 } ) towards this video.

In this section, we show how we predict video v  X  X  popu-larity based on this { ( t i ,s i ) } sequence by taking all of the exogenous impact, endogenous impact, and sentiment into consideration. Just as defined by most of similar studies, we use each video X  X  view count as its popularity indication.
Temporal point process has been widely used to describe data that are localized at a finite set of time points[5]. We denote the historical view process as H t  X  = { t 1 ,t t  X  t i +1 } , and the probability of an event occurring at time t can be defined as  X  ( t | H t  X  ) according to a point process definition. Thus the expected number of views at time t can be defined as  X ( t | H t  X  ) = R t 0  X  ( s | H s  X  ) ds = E [ N ( t ) | H The question here is how to design a proper  X  ( t | H t  X  the scenario to be analyzed.

Hawkes Process [11] is an important class of point pro-cesses, and has been successfully applied in many areas. The formulation of Hawkes Process is shown as in Equation(1) where  X  is called as  X  X mmigrant Function X , and  X ( t | H is called as  X  X esponse Function X . Just as shown in Equa-tion(1),the advantage of Hawkes Process is that it can com-bine two very different factors,  X  and  X ( t | H t  X  ), to simulate reality. where  X ( t | H t  X  ) = P t
A Hawkes process should meet the following three assump-tions[11]: (1)  X   X  0, and  X  (  X  )  X  0, if  X   X  0, (2)  X  (  X  ) = 0,if  X  &lt; 0,and (3) R  X  0  X  (  X  ) d X   X  1 to ensure stationary. These assumptions imply that:  X  (  X  ) =  X   X  f (  X  ;  X  ), where 0  X   X   X  0, and f (  X  ;  X  ) is a probability density function with parameter  X  . Under this parameterization,  X  is referred as the Inten-sity Parameter , f (  X  ;  X  ) is the Response Kernel , and  X  is the Kernel Parameter . Thus Equation(1) can be transformed to Equation(2). where t is the current time stamp, and s is the time stamp by which event in time t is triggered.
Sentiments play essential roles in videos X  popularity prop-agation processes. Generally speaking, we are most con-cerned with two kinds of sentiments: Positive and Negative , and they might self-evolve laterally or cross-affect recipro-cally.

Commonly, there are three scenarios when a user might choose to watch a video. To make a simple explanation, we take the positive sentiment process as an example. (1) Exogenous(or Immigrant) Impact. Movies, for in-stance, usually have fancy trailers before they are released. The trailer might exert a positive impact on viewers, and intrigue a large audience to make their plan to watch. The Immigrant Function  X  in Hawkes process(shown in Equa-tion(2)) could be used to formulize this influence. However, different from Equation(2), which assumes  X  as a constant, we will implement a more flexible function  X  ( t ) to fit our scenario (2) Self-Excitation(One Component of Endogenous Im-pact). Friends X  recommendations might intrigue one to watch a video, and after watching it, he/she might also have a pos-itive opinion about it. This positive to positive(PosPos) sen-timent transfer describes a self-excitation process, and can be formulized by a Self Response Function  X  ii . (3) Cross-Excitation(One Component of Endogenous Im-pact). Friends X  complaints could also intrigue one to watch a video, since he/she wants to know how bad it is. How-ever, it often happens that he/she finds the video is not as bad as imagined, and worth a watch. This negative to posi-tive(NegPos) sentiment transfer describes a cross-excitation process, and can be formulized by a Cross Response Func-tion  X  ij .

We use Figure 2 to demonstrate the whole process. In Fig-ure 2, the upper line indicates the positive process and the lower one indicates the negative process. Taking the posi-tive process as an example, a positive individual might be af-fected by the exogenous influence(the hollow circle), the self-excitation impact(the red solid circle) or the cross-excitation impact(the green solid circle). Equivalently, the mathemat-ical formation of the intensity rate function of DSHP can be represented as Equation(3), where i,j  X  X  1 , 2 }  X  i ( t ) =  X  i ( t ) + X In a real application, Immigrant Function  X  i ( t ) and Re-sponse Functions(including  X  ii ( t  X  t i,k )(Self Response Func-tion) and  X  ij ( t  X  t j,l )(Cross Response Function)) in Equa-tion(3) need to be instantiated. In the video propagation scenario, we use the kernels mentioned in Section 3.3 to function. In most related studies,  X  is treated as a constant[28]. However, in a real situation, it is hard to make such a strong assertion. According to the Information Cascading Theory , individuals are inclined to abandon their own private signals in favor of inferences based on earlier people X  X  behavior in the social network. Most hardened fans will be activated at the very beginning, and as time goes on, more and more people will make their viewing decisions according to social signals instead of their private signals. Thus, it is more reasonable to model  X  as a decreasing function than as a constant.
The Pareto Distribution is a power law probability distri-bution that is frequently being used in description of social observable phenomenon, and video watching is exactly a so-cial phenomenon. Thus in this paper, we use the Pareto distribution as the immigrant function. The formulation of the Pareto distribution can be written as Equation(4), where  X  i is the immigrant parameter controlling the shape of the this function, and the scale parameter is simplified to be 1 in this paper. There are two kinds of response functions: Self Response Function and Cross Response Function . To make a simple illustration, we use the same function to model both of them. According to Hawkes Process X  X  definition, the response func-tion  X  (  X  ;  X  ) could be detailed as  X   X  f (  X  ;  X  ) (Equation(1) and Equation(2)), where  X  is referred to as the Intensity Param-eter , f ( t  X  t i,k , X  ) the Response Kernel , and  X  is the Kernel Parameter .

Exponential, Power-law and Rayleigh distribution are the three most widely used functions in modeling diffusion over networks[7], but exponential and power-law are strict de-creasing models. However, a strict decreasing assumption is too strong to apply in a real situation. Just like an infec-tion, the likelihood one responds to a message might rise to a peak and then drop, since he/she needs time to watch the video mentioned by his/her friends, and then give a reaction. Rayleigh distribution, which is previously used in epidemi-ology, is a non-monotonic parametric model that can fit this situation. Thus, this paper chooses Rayleigh distribution as the response kernel. The Rayleigh distribution can be written as Equation(5) Taking cross response function as an example, the whole response function can be illustrated as Equation(6). and complete intensity rate function can be written as Equa-tion(7). We have 10 parameters,  X  i ,  X  j ,  X  ii ,  X  ij ,  X   X  ,  X  ji ,  X  jj ,to optimize. This paper adopts an EM to make parameter inference and optimization.  X  ( t ) = X
Equation(3) establishes the equivalence with the following four statistical statements: (1) The number of spontaneous individuals in sentiment i over the interval [0 ,T ] is a Poisson process with rate  X  i ( t ). (2) The number of self-excited in-dividuals to event t i,k over the interval [ t i,k ,T ] is a Poisson process with rate  X  ii ( t  X  t i,k ). (3) The number of cross-excited individuals to event t j,l over the interval [ t j,l Poisson process with rate  X  ij ( t  X  t j,l ). (4) All of the Poisson processes in (1)-(3) are independent.

In this scenario, if we can detect to which Poisson process each individual belongs, the estimation of the whole process is routine. Inspired by Peter Halpin X  X  paper[10], we use an EM to infer the parameters. For each individual k , we use a to indicate its affiliation. Z i,j,l = 1 indicates that the asso-ciated event happening in the i th process is evoked by the l th event in j th process, and Z i, 0 , 0 = 1 indicates this is an immigrant event in i th process.

In the E step, the posterior probability of Z can be ob-tained from Bayes X  rule. The posterior probability of k event in the i th process is evoked by the l th event in the j process can be calculated as Equation(8).
 In the M step, the expectation of log-likelihood function can be written as Equation(9).

X According to Olson et al.[22], R t 0  X  ( t ) dt and R t 0 be treated as 1 when assuming the whole process is station-ary. Under the three assumptions (mentioned in Section 3.1), a Hawkes process should be stationary. Thus, Equa-tion(9) can be extended and reformatted as Equation(10). Q (  X  ) = X By taking the derivatives of Equation(10), we can get each parameter X  X  optimized value. Taking  X  i ,  X  ij and  X  ij as ex-Type # Video Time Span # Comments Positive Movies 2638 2188 days 3,333,281 65.1%
News 1750 25 days 176,657 9.4% amples, the optimized values could be inferred as Equation(11)-(13), and others could be calculated similarly. According to the point process X  X  definition, the point counts within a period of time [ T,t ] could be obtained by integrat-ing the rate function over [ T,t ]. Thus, the predicted value could be calculated as Equation(14) with the optimized pa-rameters.

Because most existing datasets cannot provide sentiment information associated with each view record, we make our own crawlers to get data from websites. In our study, we an-alyze the four most important types of online videos: Movie, TV Episode(TV), Music Video(MV) and Online News(News). Our data comes from two resources: YouTube and Douban. (1) YouTube is the largest video website in the world, and it has attracted billions of users to view and comment videos on it. However, because of copyright laws, many movies and TVs are not available from YouTube. Thus, we use YouTube to collect data about MVs and news. (2) Douban is the largest video community websites in China. Although it does not directly provide videos, Douban provides a friendly platform for users to share their opinions about movies and TVs. Importantly, Douban provides very detailed sentiment information for each view record . Thus, we use Douban to collect data about movies and TVs. Table 1 gives general statistics about our four datasets. In Table 1,  X # Video X  indicates the number of videos in-cluded,  X  X ime Span X  indicates the average existence peri-ods of videos in the dataset,  X # Comments X  indicates total comments number in the dataset, and  X  X ositive X  indicates the proportion of videos that receive more positive feed-backs. Our four datasets reflect three very different situ-ations: movie and MV have a comparably balance distribu-tion on the positive and negative sentiments, but TV has an extreme positive inclination, while news videos has an extreme negative inclination. This diversity will help us to examine the models from a more reliable way.
 Because movie, TV and MV have longer time span, we use Day as the time granularity for them, but for news, we take Hour as its time granularity. For each video, we use the last half of view records as the test data, and the remaining half as the training data. All the models are run and compared on the same datasets.

Records in movie and TV datasets have been clearly as-sociated with rate information. We tag records whose rate is equal or higher than 7/10 as positive records, and tag the ones whose rate is less than 5/10 as negative records. Records in MV and news datasets have no rate information, so we implement a sentiment tool 4 [18]on the comments X  con-tents to get their sentiments.
Generally speaking, typical solutions for popularity pre-dictions include: Regression Model , Classification Extended Regression Models , Time Series Models , Poisson Process Models . To make a complete examination, we compare DSHP with each of the models mentioned above. Six models are constructed as benchmarks to evaluate DSHP X  X  predictive power. Before going to the comparison results, we provide some primary knowledge about these models. In the follow-ing models, Y ( t ) is used to indicate the view count at time point t . (1) Baseline Model : Translation Model(TL) . TL simply uses view count from the previous time point as the current view count. It can be defined as Equation(15).
 (2) Regression Model : Multiple Linear Regression(MLR) . In our scenario, early view counts are regarded as indepen-dent variables to predict later view counts. The calculation method is shown as Equation(16), where  X  is the constant,  X  i is the weight for time i , and i is the residual, n is the number of independent variables taken into consideration. In our experiment, we take n as 5.
 http://sentiment.vivekn.com (3) Classification Model : k-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) . Tra-ditional KNN is a powerful classification model, and it also could be extended to solve a regression problem. In our scenario, the specific calculation method is shown in Equa-tion(17), where N ( v ) is the set of k nearest points to video v in the training set with regard to the views in previous 5 days, and d (  X  ) is the distance function. In this paper, we implement the Euclidean distance.
 (4) Time Series Model : Auto-Regressive Moving Aver-age Model(ARMA) . ARMA is one of the most popular mod-els in time series analysis. Given the watching counts in the past several days, it can make fine-grained prediction for the video X  X  future popularity, leveraging the trend, periodic-ity and autocorrelation exhibited in the history information. The function for ARMA is shown in Equation(18), where c is the constant,  X  s are the parameters for the autoregres-sive process,  X  s are the parameters for the moving average process, and s are the white noises.
 (5) Poisson Process Model : Reinforced Poisson Pro-cess(RPP) . Poisson process has long been widely proved to be efficient in dynamic process simulation and prediction. RPP is a recently proposed Poisson process extended model and has been proved to be capable in prediction. The func-tion of RPP is shown in Equation(19), where g d is the intrin-sic attractiveness, f d (  X , X  d ) is the relaxation function, and i ( i ) is the total view counts received up to time t . f d is set as log-normal relaxation function as recommended. (6) Hawkes Process Model : Univariate Hawkes Pro-cess(UHP) . To test the effects from the dual-sentiment mech-anism, we also construct a UHP model for comparison. UHP takes Equation(2) as its framework and implements the ker-nels described in Section 3.3.

For evaluation purpose, we adopt two standard measure-ments as metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Accuracy.
MAPE measures the average deviation between predicted and real data. The lower MAPE values is, the better perfor-mance the model has. Denoting with p i ( t ) as the predicted view count, and r i ( t ) as the real view count, we can obtain the MAPE over N videos as shown in Equation(20).
 Accuracy measures the fraction of videos that are correctly predicted for a given error tolerance . In this paper, we set as 1. That is to say, when the count difference between predicted and real view is less than 1, we count it as an accurate result. The Accuracy calculation in this paper is shown as Equation(21).

Figure 3 and Figure 4 shows the evaluation results from these two measurements. It is very clear that DSHP, UHP and RPP have better performances than ARMA, MLR,KNN and TL. Strictly speaking, TL has no predictive power; it just takes the previous view count as the current predictive view count, so it is reasonable for TL to have the comparably worst performance. Both MLR and ARMA assume there is a linear relationship between view counts on early and later time points, but this assumption is somehow over strong. Thus, both MLR and ARMA do not perform well. KNN makes prediction from a classification perspective, however, it ignores the historical and trend characteristics along the time line.

In comparison, DSHP, UHP and RPP have better perfor-mances. All of these three employ Poisson Process as their underlying mechanism. A Poisson process is a stochastic process that directly models events arrival patterns within a system, and it has been widely proved to be suitable for time series modeling.

According to the comparison results, RPP performs a lit-tle worse than DSHP and UHP. This is because RPP is designed for paper citation prediction, but not for videos X  view counts prediction. The difference is that social media environment is far more complicated than documentation area. Paper citation is a ritual behavior. People cite a pa-per most result from one simple reason: the cited paper is classical. Thus a single Poisson process may be enough to fit it well. Video watch is a ruleless behavior. People watch a video can result from many different reasons: they like the actors/actresses, they are recommended by friends, they are informed by a billboard, or they just want to kill time. A single Poisson process is insufficient in this scenario. RPP only implements one Poisson process, while DSHP and UHP have exploited Hawkes process, which combines sev-eral Poisson processes, to describe various reasons. This is why DSHP and UHP can reach better results than RPP.
DSHP performs a little better than UHP. Basically, DSHP and UHP share the same mechanism, so they have very sim-ilar performances. However, UHP implies the  X  X omogenous Node X  assumption and does not distinguish different senti-ments, while DSHP has incorporated sentiment information. Compared to UHP, DSHP is closer to reality, and thus get a better result.

In this part, we construct two experiments to reveal the underlying mechanisms that drive videos X  dynamics. (1)Experiment One: Comparison among Different Types of Videos . As shown in Table 1, we have four types of videos at hand, and we will explore different prop-agation characteristics of different types of videos. In or-der to make a fair and thorough comparison, we extract two kinds of videos, Positive Video and Negative Video, for further exploration and analysis. Positive Videos are the videos that possess more than 60% positive comments, and Negative Videos are the videos that possess more than 60% negative comments (2) Experiment Two: Comparison among Differ-ent Qualities of Videos(taking movies as examples) . Videos have different qualities even if they are of the same type. Taking movies as examples, some of them gain both fame and wealth, some only obtain good reputations but lim-ited audience, some make money but are widely criticized, and some are total flops. In this experiment, we will get a more detailed view about the propagation differences among videos of different qualities. Due to space limitations, we will only use movies as examples. We have defined four kinds of movies: Elitist , with 8/10 or higher rate and more than 10000 comments; Niche Drama(Niche) with 8/10 or higher rate but less than 5000 comments, Popcorn Flick(Popcorn) , with less than 5/10 rate but more than 10000 comments, and Flop , with less than 5/10 rate and less than 5000 comments.
Results are shown in Figure (5)-(7). In these figures, labels like  X  X oviePositive X  represent  X  X ositive Movie X  de-scribed above, labels like  X  X litist X  represent  X  X litist Movie X , and labels like  X  X osPos X  represents the  X  X ositive to Positive X  sentiment transfer.
Immigrant distribution describes the probability of an in-dividual who spontaneously chooses to watch a video with-out any influence from the  X  X ord of mouth X  process. Specif-ically speaking, this distribution is affected by a video X  X  in-trinsic attributes, like its cast, scripts, or trailers.
Figure 5(a) presents the immigrant distributions of differ-ent types of videos. Since there are various types of videos from two different platforms, comparisons among the abso-lute values of immigrant parameters are meaningless. We pay more attention to the inspiring distribution shapes.
From Figure 5(a) we can see videos are clearly differen-tiated according to their types. Specifically, the movie X  X  immigrant distributions are gentle and long lasting, while the news X  are sharp and soon fading. This result is con-sistent with reality. The movie always has some signifi-cant attributes, such as famous actors/actresses(e.g. Johnny Depp), popular scripts (e.g. Harry Potter), or attractive preview trailers. These features will continuously intrigue potential watchers. On the contrary, social news X  timeli-ness has determined its corresponding videos X  short-lasting immigrant influences.

Figure 5(b) shows the immigrant distributions of movies with different qualities.

Let us start from the good movies, namely Elitist( the popular good movie) and Niche(the unpopular good movie). Both Elitist and Niche open with remarkable positive influ-ences and trivial negative ones. The only difference is that Elitist X  X  first shot is much stronger(Elitist X  X  positive immi-grant parameter is 30 . 44, and Niche X  X  is 13 . 15). Putting so-cial network propagation processes aside, the intenser initial immigrant influence has already helped accumulate much a larger audience, making a big difference. Thus, even for a good movie, the immigrant impacts, such as star effects or trailer effects, are also essential factors to facilitate a movie X  X  final popularity.
 Bad movies, namely Popcorn(the popular bad movie) and Flop(the unpopular bad movie), have very different immi-grant distributions from each other. Flop can be detected from the very beginning since it has a noticeable negative start, while Popcorn, although negative sentiment domi-nates, has comparably gentle and long lasting immigrant distributions, especially the positive one. The intense nega-tive sentiment from the beginning has prevented the public from seeing a bad movie, and makes it a Flop. On the contrary, Popcorn has suppressed the negative impact suc-cessfully and gained much more viewers. Thus, a bad movie still a chance to be popular if it can find methods to repress the negative sentiment X  X  explosion and hold a long lasting positive immigrant influence, even insignificant, from the beginning.
The intense parameters reflect the overall intensity of re-sponsiveness of a person to others X  opinions[10]. For each Hawkes processes in DSHP, its two intense parameters should meet  X  ii +  X  ij  X  1 indicating the weight proportion of each re-sponse kernel. Figure 6 shows the proportions of the intense parameters in our two experiments. The warm color system (red and orange) represents the values from the positive pro-cess and the cold color system(blue and green) represents the negative process. The values are comparable within in one color system, but incomparable across color systems .
Figure 6(a) shows the proportions of intense parameters among different types of videos. According to the results, all kinds of videos have similar intense distributions. For positive videos, people are more likely to respond to positive comments, while for negative videos, people are more likely to respond to negative comments. This phenomenon might result from the fact that positive/negative comments are dominant, so they have more probability to trigger others.
Figure 6(b) shows the intense parameter proportions among different qualities of videos. On one hand, we find the sim-ilar patterns which have been emphasized in the previous paragraph: for a good movie, people are more likely to re-spond to positive comments, and for a bad movie, people are more likely to respond to negative comments. On the other hand, we find that a movie X  X  popularity and its intense pa-rameters are independent. Although Elitist and Popcorn are more popular than Niche and Flop respectively, Elitist and Niche share very similar intense proportions, and Popcorn and Flop also share very similar intense proportions. From this demonstration, we can find that popularity and quality are two independent features of a video. A popular video is not necessary to be good, and similarly, a good video is not necessary to be popular. This result is very instructive for a recommendation system when it needs to decide whether to recommend a  X  X opular X  movie or a  X  X ood X  movie.
The kernel parameters control shapes of kernel distribu-tions, and reflect overall nature of responsiveness between persons. Figure(7) provides a brief view about kernel distri-butions among different types of videos and different quali-ties of movies. Figure (7) has high consistency with Figure (6).

Figures 7(a)-(d) demonstrate the response kernels X  dis-tributions of positive videos. It is very clear that positive to positive sentiment transfer(PosPos) is quick and intense among all these videos, especially in news broadcast. Pos-Neg also easily happens. Interestingly, MV has a very differ-ent pattern. Even for positive MV, NegNeg transfer is still considerable. This indicates that although positive domi-nates, negative comments tend to come densely in a period of time.

Figures 7(e)-(h) demonstrate the response kernels X  distri-butions of negative videos. Similarly, NegNeg transfer is quick and intense in negative videos. NegPos also easily happens in most videos except TV. Figure (7)(f) implies that people have a lower tolerance towards bad TV. For other types of videos, although negatives dominate, positive comments will appear from time to time, but for TV, the positive comments obviously occur much less frequently.
Figures 7(i)-(l) show the kernel distributions for movies of different qualities. It is very understandable that Elitist has an intense and quick PosPos transfer pattern.

Niche has a strong PosNeg transfer pattern, but has a very weak NegPos one. That is why Niche could not be popular. As common sense, positive comments will encour-age potential viewers but negative comments will discourage them. However, Niche does not have dramatic PosPos pat-terns, and most positive comments are disabled by following negative comments. What is worse, Niche could not survive quickly from those negative comments since it has a weak NegPos transfer pattern.

On the contrary, Popcorn enjoys a quick survival since it has a strong NegPos transfer pattern. Although a Popcorn might have many negative comments, these comments could quickly be replaced by the immediately appearing positive ones. Thus Popcorns could continuously encourage future viewers. Moreover, its weak PosNeg pattern indicates once a positive comment appears, it would not be replaced by negative ones instantly.
This paper has proposed a novel video popularity predic-tion model X  DSHP. Compared to previous related works, DSHP mainly has two advantages. First, it implements Hawkes process as its framework, modeling the arrival pro-cess directly. As shown in our evaluation section, Hawkes process has been proved to have a better performance. Sec-ond, DSHP is a sentiment propagation driven model. DSHP not only achieves a better performance by emphasizing sen-timents X  importance in video X  X  popularity propagation, but also reveals more underlying factors which make a video X  X  popularity.

This paper still has mainly two points that need to be strengthened. First, DSHP is designed for the scenarios where content features, such as cast, descriptions or genre, are unavailable. However, in some situations, these features could be accessed. DSHP could be easily extended by adapt-ing the immigrant function to incorporate content features. In future work, we will explore DSHP X  X  ability by consider-ing content features. Second, we only take two sentiments, positive and negative, into consideration because we assume only these two sentiments will make a difference. However, some viewers might express no obvious sentiment polarities after watching a video. Thus a neutral sentiment inclination should also be taken into consideration. In future work, we plan to add one more Hawkes process, which represent neu-tral sentiment, to examine an indifferent sentiment X  X  influ-ences on a video X  X  popularity propagation. [1] P.
