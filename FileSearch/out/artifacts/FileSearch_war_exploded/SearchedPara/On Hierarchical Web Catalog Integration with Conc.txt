 Web catalog integration is an interesting problem in cur-rent digital content management. Past studies have shown that using a flattened structure with auxiliary information extracted from the source catalog can improve the integra-tion results. However, the nature of a flattened structure ignores the hierarchical relationships, and thus the perfor-mance improvement of catalog integration may be reduced. In this paper, we propose an enhanced hierarchical cata-log integration (EHCI) approach with conceptual thesauri extracted from the source catalog. The results show that our enhanced hierarchical integration approach effectively boosts the accuracy of hierarchical catalog integration.

With the explosive growth of various kinds of Web infor-mation, an integrated Web catalog is becoming important service for on-line vendors and Internet users [1, 2, 4]. An early study has shown that only about 20% of the catego-rized sites retrieved from both Yahoo! and Google catalogs are the same [2], which means that users may need to spend much effort browsing different Web catalogs to obtain the required materials.

As noted in [1], catalog integration is not just a classifica-tion task because when some implicit source information is exploited, the integration accuracy can be highly improved. A foremost approach has first been proposed to enhance the Naive Bayes classifier with implicit source information [1]. Other studies (e.g. [2, 4]) employ SVMs to enhance the accuracy performance. Since these studies only consider a flattened integration structure, they completely ignore the hierarchical relationships between the categories and subcat-egories in the destination catalog, and thus the integration accuracy is restrained.

Past studies have shown that exploiting a hierarchical structure in classification may bring better advantages than using a flattened structure [3]. However, it has not been testified in Web catalog integration. In this paper, we pro-pose an enhanced hierarchical catalog integration (EHCI) approach with conceptual relationships extracted from the source catalog thesaurus to improve the integration perfor-mance. We applied SVM classifiers to the EHCI approach in our experiments and compared its performance with that of a simple hierarchical catalog integration approach (SHCI), which is designed referring to [3] and [5]. The experimen-tal results have shown that the EHCI approach effectively boosts the accuracy of hierarchical catalog integration over all categories.
In the integration process, we assume that there are two hierarchical catalogs participating in the integration process. Figure 1 illustrates the process of automated hierarchical catalog integration. One is the source catalog S with a set of m categories S 1 , S 2 , ... , S m , their subcategories, and so on down to the lowest-layered subcategories. The other is the destination catalog D with a set of n categories D 1 , D ... , D n , their subcategories, and so on down to the lowest-layered subcategories. The integration process is performed by merging each document d in S into a correspondent des-tination category in D . That is, for each layered directory in the hierarchy, training documents in each directory are trained as directory classifiers and local classifiers to help each document d integrate into a corresponding directory. Only the documents integrated into the corresponding lay-ered categories and subcategories are viewed as correctly integrated.
In hierarchical catalog integration, a one-against-rest strat-egy is used at each decision point in the hierarchy to inte-grate documents into the matching directory, and the desti-nation classifiers are trained with the hierarchy labels for fur-ther enhancement. To improve the integration accuracy, a weight formula is designed to extract the semantic concepts existing in the source catalog. In Equation 1, the weight of each thesaurus is exponentially decreased and accumulated according to the increased layers to represent the semantic

Equation 1 cal-culates the feature weight of each document, in which L i represents the relevant label weight assigned exponentially as 1 / 2 i ,and f x represents the occurrence ratio of feature x in the document. If feature x appears in the label feature, L x is denoted as the label weight with the layer that x is located. Otherwise, L x is denoted by zero. L i represents the label weight with an i -layer depth, and the weight cor-respondingly decreases down to the top layer with an n -layer depth. With such a thesaurus weighting scheme, the con-ceptual relationships of the layered source categories can be transformed and added into the test documents.

Likewise, to build enhanced classifiers in destination cat-egories, the EHCI scheme is used in the destination catalog. With the enhancement of the features and native category label information, the classifiers can thus be trained to be more distinctive to classify the documents into the correct categories. The threshold  X  is heuristically set as 0.05 to accommodate the weights of the source thesauri to enhance the destination classifiers, and so is the value of  X  set in the native destination category.

The EHCI approach described in the previous section was applied to a collection of 17888 pages retrieved from the Ya-hoo! catalog and a collection of 17890 pages retrieved from the Google catalog. In Table 1, a set of 1472 classes in the Yahoo! catalog ( C Y ) and a set of 3343 classes in the Google catalog ( C G ) were organized according to the original hi-erarchy in a depth of six layers. The test documents are selected by intersecting documents of Yahoo! with those of Google, namely Y  X  G, in which the number of t Y and t G is different in the sense that some test documents may ap-pear in more than one class simultaneously. The training documents of the Yahoo! catalog ( T Y  X  G ) and the Google catalog ( T G  X  Y ) are gathered by subtracting the intersected documents, namely Y  X  G. In this experiment, the documents are both integrated from Yahoo! into Google and from Google to Yahoo!. Figure 2 illustrates that the overall per-formance of EHCI outperforms the original HCI approach in both Yahoo!-to-Google and Google-to-Yahoo! catalog in-tegration. The result further shows that the conceptual re-lationships are consistently effective in catalog integration.

This paper reports our studies on the effects of a hier-archical scheme to enhance the integration accuracy. By exploiting the hierarchical relationships between categories and subcategories, the improvement of integration accuracy is very promising. It shows that a hierarchical integration scheme is effective for Web catalog integration, and our EHCI approach consistently achieves improvements on real-world catalogs with SVM classifiers.
