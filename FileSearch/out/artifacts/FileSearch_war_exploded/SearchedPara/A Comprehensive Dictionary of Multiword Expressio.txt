 Linguistically idiosyncratic multiword expressions occur in authentic sentences with an unexpectedly high frequency. Since (Sag et al. 2002), we have become aware that a proper solution of idiosyncratic multiword expressions (MWEs) is one of the most difficult and intriguing problems in NLP. In principle, the nature of the idiosyncrasy of MWEs is twofold: one is idiomaticity, i.e., non -compositionality of meaning; the other is th e strong probabilistic affinity between component words. Many attempts have been made to extract these expressions from corpora, mainly using automated methods that exploit statistical means. However, to our knowledge, no reliable, extensive solution has y et been made available, presumably because of the difficulty of extracting correctly without any human insight. Recognizing the crucial importance of such expressions, one of the authors of the current paper began in the 1970s to construct a Japanese elect ronic dictionary with comprehensive inclusion of idioms, idiom -like expressions, and probabilistically idiosyncratic expressions for general use. In this paper, we begin with an overview of the JDMWE (Japanese Dictionary of Multi -Word Expressions). It has approximately 104,000 dictionary entries and covers potentially at least 750,000 expressions. The most important features of the JDMWE are: 1. A large notational, syntactic, and semantic diversity of contained expressions 2. A detailed description of synta ctic function and structure for each entry expression 3. An indication of the syntactic flexibility of entry expressions (i.e., possibility of internal modification o f constituent word s ) of entry expressions.

In section 2, we outline the main features of t he present study, first presenting a brief summary of significant previous work on this topic. In section 3, we propose and describe the criteria for selecting MWEs and introduce a number of classes of multiword expressions. In section 4, we outline the fo rmat and contents of the JDMWE, discussing the information on notational variants, syntactic functions, syntactic structures, and the syntactic flexibility of MWEs. In section 5, we describe and explain the contextual conditions stipulated in the JDMWE. In section 6, we illustrate some important statistical properties of the JDMWE by comparing the dictionary with a large -scale Japanese N -gram frequency dataset, the LDC2009T08, generated by Google Inc. (Kudo et al. 2009). The paper ends with concluding rema rks in section 7. Gross (1986) analyzed French compound adverbs and compound verbs. According to his estimate, the lexical stock of such words in French would be respectively 3.3 and 1.7 times greater than that of single -word adverbs and singl e -word verbs. Jackendoff (1997) notes that an English speaker X  X  lexicon would contain as many MWEs as single words. Sag et al. (2002) pointed out that 41% of the entries of WordNet 1.7 (Fellbaum 1999) are multiword; and Uchiyama et al. (2003) reported that 44% of Japanese verbs are VV -type compounds. These and other similar observations underscore the great need for a well -designed, extensive MWE lexicon for practical natural language processing. 
In the past, attempts have been made to produce an MWE dicti onary. Examples include the following: Gross (1986) reported on a dictionary of French verbal MWEs with description of 22 syntactic structures; Kuiper et al. (2003) constructed a database of 13,000 English idioms tagged with syntactic structures; Villavice ncio (2004) attempted to compile lexicons of English idioms and verb -particle constructions (VPCs) by augmenting existing single -word dictionaries with specific tables; Baptista et al. (2004) reported on a dictionary of 3,500 Portuguese verbal MWEs with te n syntactic structures; Fellbaum et al. (2006) reported corpus -based studies in developing German verb phrase idiom resources; and recently, Laporte et al. (2008) have reported on a dictionary of 6,800 French adverbial MWEs annotated with 15 syntactic stru ctures.

Our JDMWE approach differs from these studies in that it can treat more comprehensive types of MWEs. Our system can handle almost all types of MWEs except compositional compounds, named entities, acronyms, blends, politeness expressions, and functi onal expressions; in contrast, the types of MWEs that most of the other studies can deal with are limited to verb -object idioms, VPCs, verbal MWEs, support -verb constructions (SVCs) and so forth. Many attempts have been made to extract MWEs automatically using statistical corpus -based methods. For example, Pantel et al. (2001) sought to extract Chinese compounds using mutual information and the log -likelihood measure. Fazly et al. (2006) attempted to extract English verb -object type idioms by recognizing t heir structural fixedness in terms of mutual information and relative entropy. Bannard (2007) tried to extract English syntactically fixed verb -noun combinations using pointwise mutual information, and so on. 
In spite of these and many similar efforts, it is still difficult to adequately extract MWEs from corpora using a statistical approach, because regarding the types of multiword expressions, realistically speaking, the corpus -wide distribution can be far from exhaustive. Paradoxically, to compile an MW E lexicon we need a reliable standard MWE lexicon, as it is impossible to evaluate the automatic extraction by recall rate without such a reference. The conventional idiom dictionaries published for human readers have been occasionally used for the evaluat ion of automatic extraction methods in some past studies. However, no conventional Japanese dictionary of idioms would suffice for an MWE lexicon for the practical NLP because they lack entries related to the diverse MWE objects we frequently encounter in common textual materials, such as quasi -idioms, quasi -clich X s, metaphoric fixed or partly fixed expressions. In addition, they provide no systematic information on the notational variants, syntactic functions, or syntactic structures of the entry expressio ns. The JDMWE is intended to circumvent these problems.

In past Japanese MWE studies, Shudo et al. (1980) compiled a lexicon of 3,500 functional multiword expressions and used the lexicon for a morphological analysis of Japanese. Koyama et al. (1998) made a seven -point increase in the precision rate of kana -to -kanji conversion for a commercial Japanese word processor by using a prototype of the JDMWE with 65,000 MWEs. Baldwin et al. (2003) discussed the treatment of Japanese MWEs in the framework of Sag et al. (2002). Shudo et al. (2004) pointed out the importance of the auxiliary -verbal MWEs and their non -propositional meanings (i.e., modality in a generalized sense). Hashimoto et al. (2009) studied a disambiguation method of semantically ambiguous idioms using 146 basic idioms. The human deliberate judgment is indispensable for the correct, extensive extraction of MWEs. In view of this, we have manually extracted multiword expressions that have definite syntactic, semantic, or c ommunicative functions and are linguistically idiosyncratic from a variety of publications, such as newspaper articles, journals, magazines, novels, and dictionaries. In principle, the idiosyncrasy of MWEs is twofold: first, the semantic non -compositionali ty (i.e., idiomaticity); second, the strong probabilistic affinity between component words. Here we have treated them differently. 
The number of words included in a MWE ranges from two to eighteen. The length distribution is shown in Figure 1. 3.1 Non -Compositional MWEs In our approach, we use non -substitutability criteri on to define a word string as an MWE , t he logic being that a n MWE expression is usually fixed in its form and the substitution of one of its const ituent words would yield a meaningless expression or an e xpression with a meaning that is completely different from that of the original MWE expression . Formally, a word string w 1 w 2 ... w ... w n (2  X  n  X  18) is a n MWE if it has a definite syntactic, semantic, or communicative function of its own , and if w 1 w 2 ... w i  X  ... w n is either meaning less or has a meaning completely di f ferent from that of w 1 w 2 ... w i ... w n for some i, where w is any sy n onym or sy n onymous phras e of w i . For example,  X  (w 1 ) - X  - X  X  X  aka -no -tanin (lit.  X  red stranger  X  ) is selected because it has a definite nominal mea n ing of  X  complete stranger  X  and neither  X  X  X  (w 1  X  ) - X  - X  X  X  s inku -no -tanin nor  X   X  X  X  (w 1  X  ) - X  - X  X  X  r eddo -no -tanin means  X  complete stranger  X  . The evalua tion of semantic relevance of MWEs was carried out by human judges entirely. It is just too difficult to judge the semantic relevance automatically and correctly. Tab le 1 shows a number of MWEs of this type . 1 3.2 Probabilistically Idiosyncratic MWEs An MWE mus t form a linguistic unit of its own. This and the follow ing transition probability condition constitute another criteri on that we adopt to define what an MWE is. Form al ly, a word string w w 2 ... w i ... w n (2  X  n  X  18) is a n MWE if it has a definite syntactic, semantic, or communicative function of its own , and if its forward or backward transi tion probability p f (w i+1 |w 1 ... w i ) or p b ... w n ) , respectively is judged to be in the relatively high range for some i. W ith this definition, for example,  X  - X  - X  X  X  te -wo -komaneku  X  fold arms  X  is selected as an MWE because it is a well -formed verb phrase and p b (  X  |  X  - X  X  X  ) is judged empirically to be very high. No general probabilistic threshold value can be fixed a priori because th e value is expression -dependent. Although the probabilistic judgment was performed , for each expression in turn, on the basis of the developer  X  s empirical language model, the resulting dataset is consistent with this criterion on the whole as shown in sect ion 6.1. Table 2 lists some MWEs of this type . 2 Table 2 : Probabilistically Idiosyncratic Expressions With entri es like these, an NLP system can use the JDMWE as a reliable reference while effe c tively disambiguating the structure s in the syntactic analysis process .

Of the MWEs in the JDMWE, approximately 3 8 % and 9 2 % of them were judged to meet criterion 3.1 and cri terion 3.2, respectively . These are illustrated in Figure 2 .
 Figure 2 : Approximate constituent ratio of non -compositional MWEs and probabilistically bound MWEs The JDMWE has approximately 104,000 entrie s, one for each MWE, co mposed of six fields, namely, entry form of an MWE is stated in Field -H in the form of a non -segmented h ira -k ana (phonetic ch a r acter) string. An example is given in Figure 3 . 4.1 N otational Information (Field -N) Japanese has three notational options : h ira -k ana, k ata -k ana , and k anji . The two kana s are phonological syllabaries. Kanji are originally Chinese idi o graphic characters. As we have many kanji characters that are both homo phon ic and synonymous , sentences can contain kanji r e pl a ceable by others. In addition, the inflectional suffix of some verb s can be absent in some co n texts . The JDMWE has flexible conventions to cope with these characteristics. It uses brackets to ind i cate an o p tional word (or a series of interchangeable words marked off by the slash  X  /  X  ) in the Field -N d e scri p tion. Therefore , the entry whose Field -H (the first field ) is  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ki -no -ii -yatu (lit.  X  a guy who has a good spirit  X  )  X  good -natured guy  X  , can have (  X  /  X  ) - X  -(  X  /  X  /  X  /  X  )  X  -(  X  X  X  /  X  /  X  X  X  ) in its Field -N. T he dash  X  - X  is used as a word boundar y indicator. This example can stand for twenty -four combinatorial variants , i.e.,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  , ... ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  , ... ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  .
 I f fully expanded with this information , the JDMWE  X  s total number of MWEs can exceed 750,000 . 4.2 Functional Information (Field -F) Linguistic functions of MWEs can be simply classified by means of codes, as shown in Tables 3 and 4. Field -F is filled with one of those codes which corresponds to a root node label in the syntactic tree representation of a MWE.
Table 4 : Communicative Functions and Ex a m ples 4.3 Structural Information (Field -S) 4.3.1 Dependency Structure The dependency structure of an MWE is given in Field -S by a phrase marker bracketing the mod i fier -head pairs , using POS symbols for conceptual words . 3 For example, an idiom  X  X  X  X  - X  - X  ma k ka -na -uso (lit.  X  crimson lie  X  )  X  downright lie  X  is given a marker [[K 00 na ] N]. This description represents the structure shown in Figure 4 , where K 00 and N are POS symbols denoting an adjective -verb stem and a noun, respectively.
The JDMWE c ontains 49 ,000 verbal entries, making this the largest functional class in the JDMWE. For these verbal entries, more than 90 patterns are actually used as structural descriptors in Field -S. This fact can indicate the broadness of the structural spectrum of Japanese verbal MWEs. Some examples are shown in Table 5 .
 Figure 4 : Example of dependency structure given in Field -S Table 5 : Examples of structural types of verbal MWEs (N: noun, V 23 : verb (adverbial form), V 30 : verb (end form), Adv: adverb, wo , ga , ni , no , de , te , and ba : particle) 4.3.2 Coordinate Structure Approximately 2,500 MWE s in the JDMWE contain internal coordinate structures. Th is information is described in Field -S by bracketing with  X  &lt;  X  and  X  &gt;  X  , and the coordinated parts by  X  (  X  and  X  )  X  . The coordinative phrase specification usually requires that the conjuncts must be para llel with respect to the syntactic function of the constituents appearing in the bracketed description. For example, an e x pression  X  - X  - X  - X  - X  X  - X  - X  - X  X  ato -ha -no -to -nare -yama -to -nare (lit.  X  the rest might b e come either a field or a mountain X )  X  X hat will be, will be X  , has an internal coordinate V 60 ])([[N to ] V 60 ])&gt;] . This description represents the structure shown in Figure 5 , where V 60 denotes an i m perative form of the verb.
 Figure 5 : Example of the coor dinate structure shown by  X  &lt;  X  and  X  &gt;  X  in Field -S 4.3.3 Non -phrasal Structure Approximately 250 MWEs in the JDMWE are syntactically ill -formed in the sense of context -free grammar but still form a syntactic unit on their own. For exa m ple,  X  X  X  X  - X  X  X  - X  X  X  - X  X  X  y urikago -kara -hakaba -made  X  X rom the cradle to the grave X  is an adjunct of two postpositional phrases but is often used as a state -describing noun as in  X  X  X  X  - X  X  X  - X  X  X  - X  X  X  - X  - X  X  yurikago -kara -hakaba -made -no -hoshou (lit. sec u rity of from cradle to grave)  X  security fro m the cradle to the grave X . Thus Field -F and Field -S have a functional code N k and a description [[N kara ][[N made ] $]], respectively . The symbol  X $ X  d e notes a null constituent occupying the position of the go v ernor on which this MWE depends . This structur e is shown in Fi g ure 6 .
 Figure 6 : Example of a non -phrasal expression with a null constituent marked with  X  $  X  in Field -S The total number of structural types specified in Field -S is nearly 6,000. This indicates that Japanese MWEs present a wide structu ral variety. 4.3.4 Internal Modifiability Some MWEs are not fixed -length word strings , but allow the occurrence of phrasal modifiers internally. In our system, this aspect is captured by prefixing a modifiable element of the structural description stat ed in the Field -S with an asterisk  X * X  . An a d verbial MWE  X  - X  - X  X  X  - X  - X  - X  ue -ni -nobe -ta -you -ni  X  as I explain ed above  X  is one such MWE and thus has a description [[[[[N ni ] *V 23 ] ta ] N] ni ] in Field -S, mean ing that the third element V 23 is a verb that can be modified internally by adverb phrase s . Since the asterisk d esignates such optional phrasal modification, our system allows a derivative expression like  X   X  - X  - X  - X  - X  X  X  X  - X  X  X  - X  - X  - X  riyuu -wo -ue -ni -kuwasiku -nobe -ta -you -ni  X  as I explaine d in detail the reason above  X  , which contains two additional, internal modif ier s . The structure is shown in Figure 7 . 4 Figure 7 : Example of internal modifiability marked by  X  *  X  in Field -S Roughly speaking, 30,000 MWEs in the JDMWE have no asterisk in their Field -S. Our rigid examination reveals that internal modification is n ot allowed for them. Approximately 6,700 MWEs need to be classified differently because they require particular forward contexts , i.e., they require co -occurrence of a particular syntactic phrase in the context that imm ediately precedes them . For example,  X  - X  - X  X  X  kao -wo -suru (lit.  X  do face  X  ) which is a support -verb construction , cannot occur without an immediately preceding adnominal modifier , e.g., the adjective  X  X  X  X  kanasii  X  sad  X  , yielding  X  X  X   X  - X  - X  - X  X  X  k a nasii -kao -wo -suru (lit.  X  do sad face  X  )  X  make a sad face  X  . This adnominal modifier co -occurrence requirement is stipulated in Field -C f by a code &lt;adnom. modifier&gt;. There are about 30 of these forward co n textual requirements. Similarly, backward contextual requirements, of w hich there are about 70, are stated in Field -C Approximately 300 MWEs require particular backward co n texts. Without a rule system of semantic composition, it is difficult to evaluate the validity of the JDMWE concerning idiomatici ty. However, we can confirm that 3,600 Japanese standard idioms that Sato (2007) listed from five Japanese idiom dictionaries published for human readers are included in the JDMWE as a proper subset. In addition, the JDMWE contains the information about th eir syntactic functions, structures, and flexibilities. 6.1 Comparison with Web N -gram We examined the statistical propert ies of the JDMWE using the Japanese Web N -gram , v ersion 1: LDC2009T08, which is a word N -gram (1  X  N  X  7) frequency dataset generated from 2  X  10 10 sentences in a Japanese Web corpus, supplied by Google Inc. (Kudo et al. 200 9 ). We will refer to this (or the Web corpus examined) subsequently as GND. We will refer to trigram w 1 w 2 w 3 as an NpV -trigram only whe n w 1 and w 3 are restricted to a noun and a verb (end form), respe c tively, and w 2 is one of the following case -particles: accusative  X  wo , subjective  X  ga , or dative  X  ni . 5 We write the number of occurrences of an expression x, counted in the GND , as C (x).

First , we obtain from the GND sets G , T , D , B , and R i  X  X  defined below , using a Japanese word dictionary IPADIC (Asahara et al. 2003) : T ={w 1 w 2 w 3 | w 1 w 2 w 3  X  JDMWE , w 1 w 2 w 3 i s a n D ={w 1 w 2 |  X  w 3 , w 1 w 2 w 3  X  G } B ={w 1 w 2 |  X  w 3 , w 1 w 2 w 3  X  T } R W e then found the following data :  X  | B | = 10 , 548  X  | D |=110,822 | R 1 |=4,983, | R 2 |=1,495, | R 3 |=786, | R 4 |=433, ... From these, we realize, for example, that 47.2% =(| R 1 |/| B |) X 100 of trigrams in T have verbs that occur most frequently in the GND, succeeding the i n dividual bigrams. An example of such a trigram is  X  X  X  X  X  X  - X  - X  X  X  X  akushon -wo -okosu (lit.  X  X aise action X )  X  X ake action X . Similarly, 14.0%= (| R 2 |/| B |) X 100 have the second most fr e quent verbs, 7.5% have the third most frequent verbs, and so on. Figure 8 (a) ill u strates the results. From this, we can assume that the higher probabil i ty p f (w 3 |w 1 w trigram w 1 w 2 w 3 has, the more likely w 3 is chosen f or each w 1 w 2 in the JDMWE. This is consistent with what we wrote in section 3.2. Figure 8 (b) is the accumulative substitute of Fi g ure 8 (a). Extrapolating Figure 8 (b) suggests that 10% of NpV -trigrams in the JDMWE do not occur in the GND. This implies that the size, i.e., 2 X 10 10 sentences of the Web corpus used by the GND is not sufficiently large to allow MWE extraction. 6 Figure 8 (a): Constituent ratio (| R i |/| B |)  X  100 for rank i of probability p f (w 3 |w 1 w 2 ); (b): Accumulative variant of (a) for rank i of pro b ability p f (w 3 |w 1 w 2 ) Secon d, we calculate the (normalized) entropy H (w 3 |w 1 w 2 ) for each w 1 w 2  X  D defined below, where the probability p f (w 3 |w 1 w 2 ) is estimated by C(w 1 w 2 w 3 )/C(w 1 w 2 ). This provides a measure of the flatness of the p f (w 3 |w 1 w 2 ) distribution canceling out the influence of the number N of verb types w 3  X  X . H After arranging 110,822 bigrams in D in ascending order of H f (w 3 |w 1 w 2 ), we divided them into 20 intervals A 1 , A 2 , ... , A 20 each with an equal number of bigrams ( 5,54 2). We then examined how many bigrams in B we re included in each interval. Figure s 9 (a) and (b) plot the resulting constit u ent ratio of the bigrams in B and the mean value of H (w 3 |w 1 w 2 ) X  X  in each inte r val, respectively. W e found , f or example, that 1,262 out of 5,54 2 bigrams are in B for the first in terval, i.e., the const i tuent ratio is 22.8 %=( 1,262 /5,54 2 )  X  100. Similarly, we obtain 22.5 %=( 1,248 /5,54 2 )  X  100 for the second interval, 20.5 %=( 1,136 /5,54 2 )  X  100 for the third, and so on. From this, we realize the macro s copic tendency that the larger the entro py H (w 3 |w 1 w 2 ) , or equivalently the perplexit y of the su c ceeding verb w 3 , a bigram w 1 w 2 has, the less likely it is adopted as a prefix of a trigram in T . 
Taking the results in Figure 8 and Figure 9 together , we can presume that not only frequently but als o exclusively occurring verb s would be the preferred choice in T . Figure 9 (a): Constituent ratio of the bigrams in B among bigrams in D in interval k (1  X  k  X  20); (b): Mean value of entropies H f ( w 3 |w 1 w 2 )  X  s in the i n terval k (1  X  k  X  20) This suggests the ge neral feasibility of the JDMWE, for its relative compactness, in effectively disambiguating the syntactic structures of input word strings.

The above investigations were carried out on the forward conditional probabilities for restricted types of MWEs. How ever, the results imply a general validity of the JDMWE since the same criteria for selection were applied to all kinds of multiword expressions. 6.2 Occurrences in Newspapers We examined 2,500 randomly selected sentences in Nikkei newspaper articles (publishe d in 2009) to determine how many MWE tokens of the JDMWE occur in them. We found that in 100 sentences an average of 74 tokens of our MWEs were used. This suggests a large lexical coverage of the JDMWE. The JDMWE is a slotted tree bank f or idiosyncratic multiword expressions, annotated with d e tailed notational, syntactic information. The idea underlying the JDMWE is that the volume and meticulousness of the lexical resource cr u cially affects the outcome of the rule -oriented, large -scale NLP. In view of this, the JDMWE was designed to encompass the wide range of linguistic objects related to Japanese MWE s , by placing importance on the recall rate in the selection of the candidate e xpressions. 7 Th e statistical properties clarified in this p aper imply the general feasibility of the JDMWE at least in the probabilistic respect.
Possible fields of application of the JDMWE include, for example:  X  Phrase -based machine t ranslation  X  Phrase -based s peech r ecognition  X  Phrase -based k ana -to -k anji c onversion  X  Search e ngine for Japanese c orpus  X  Paraphras ing system  X  Japanese d ialoguer  X  Japanese l anguage e ducation s ystem
Another aspect of the JDMWE is that i t would provide linguists with lexicological data. For example, the usage of Japanese onomat o poeic adverbs, which are mostly bound probabili s tically to specific verbs or adjectives, is extensively catalogued in the JDMWE.

The first version of the JDMWE will be released after proofread ing. 8 If possible, we would like to add fu r ther information to each MWE on morphological variants, passivization, relativization, decomposability, paraphrasing, and semantic di s ambiguation for future versions. We would like to thank the late Professors Toshihiko Kurihara and Sho Yoshida, who inspired our current research in the 1970s. Similar thanks go to Makoto Nagao. We are also grateful to everyone who assisted in the development of the JDMWE. Further special t hanks go to Akira Shimazu, Takano Ogino, and Kenji Yoshimura for their encouragement and useful discussions, to those who worked on the LDC2009T08 and IPADIC, to the three anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and advice, and to Stephan Howe for advice on matters of English style in the current paper.
