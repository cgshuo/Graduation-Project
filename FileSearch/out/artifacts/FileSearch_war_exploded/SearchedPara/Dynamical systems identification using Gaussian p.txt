In this paper the focus will be on Gaussian process models ( Williams,1998;Gibbs,1997;MacKay,2003;Rasmussen,1996 ),an emerging branch of black-box system identification aimed at alleviating the need for models with large parametrization, e.g. ANN.

In order to avoid the problems above, GP models rely on an entirely different approach. The GP model ( Williams, 1998 ) training and test input.
