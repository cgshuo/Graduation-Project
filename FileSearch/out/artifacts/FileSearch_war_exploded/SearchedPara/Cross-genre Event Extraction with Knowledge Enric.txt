 The rapid development of social media and social networks since 2000s has made it an important chan-nel of information dissemination. Because of its real-time nature, social media can be used as a sen-sor to gather up-to-date information about the state of the world. Effective automatic detection and ex-traction of events from the media will be an ex-tremely important contribution. Recently there has been increasing interests in event extraction from so-cial media (Yang et al., 1998; Kleinberg, 2003; He et al., 2007; Weng and Lee, 2011; Benson et al., 2011; Ritter et al., 2012).

Identifying and extracting events in social media is more challenging than traditional event extraction due to two major reasons: (1). Lack of Context : compared with traditional genres (e.g., new articles), social media context is usually short and incomplete (e.g., each tweet has a length limitation of 140 char-acters). Lacking of context, a single tweet itself usu-ally cannot provide a complete picture of the corre-sponding events. For example, for the tweet  X  X ray for Mali -the situation is coming to light, and it isn X  X  pretty. X  , an event extraction/discovery system (e.g. (Ji and Grishman, 2008)) fails to discover that it is about the same war event in Mali as mentioned in the news article  X  X tate military forces on Friday re-took a key town in northern Mali after intense fight-ing that included help from French military forces, a defense ministry spokesman said. X  (2). Informal Nature : social media messages are written in an in-formal style, which causes the poor performance of event extractors designed for formal genres. For ex-ample, the tweet  X #AaronSwartz, Dead @ 26, #Car-menOrtiz  X  X ushed him to exhaustion X  don X  X  let her get away with this! #scandal. X  includes an  X  X ie X  event with Aaron Swartz as the Victim . However, the person name  X  X aronSwartz X  appears in the hash-tag  X #AaronSwartz X  and  X  X ead at 26 X  is written as  X  X ead @ 26 X . Existing supervised name taggers and event extractors fail to identify the same  X  X ie X  event mentioned in the news article  X  X nternet ac-tivist Aaron Swartz dead at 26 X  .

Based on the intuition that news articles contain more detailed and formal information than tweet messages, we apply an unsupervised knowledge en-richment algorithm to link each tweet to its most relevant news article. By incorporating the cross-genre knowledge to tweets, we are able to formulate the task of event extraction on tweets as the task of cross-genre extraction for tweets and news articles. Thus we can alleviate the previous mentioned chal-lenges in single-genre event extraction for tweets to some extent. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to conduct cross-genre event extrac-tion through unsupervised knowledge enrichment. Given a tweet t i , our cross-genre event extraction framework first discovers its most relevant news arti-cle n i , then identifies event tuples (event phrases and event arguments) for the tweet ( te i ) and the news ar-ticle ( ne i ) respectively, and finally conducts merging on the event extraction outputs from both genres to produce the cross-genre event extraction result ( e i ). For example in Table 1, given the following tweet t 1 , n 1 is retrieved as its most relevant news article. te 1 and ne 1 are the extracted event tuples for the tweet and the news article respectively and e 1 is the final cross-genre event extraction output after merging. To evaluate the performance of an event extractor, the precision, recall and f-measure of the extracted event phrases and event arguments will be measured using the following criteria: an event phrase is cor-rectly labeled if it matches a reference trigger; an ar-gument is correctly labeled if it matches a reference argument. 3.1 Baseline Event Extraction Systems We use two state-of-the-art event extraction sys-tems (Ritter et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013) to extract events from tweets and news articles respectively. The tweet event extractor TwiCal-Event (Ritter et al., 2012) is able to extract open-domain significant events from Twitter. It is a supervised system that identifies event phrases and event participants with tailored part-of-speech tagging and shallow parsing for tweets. In addition, it is also able to discover event categories and classify extracted events based on latent variable models. It takes tweets as in-put and outputs a four-tuple representation of events which includes event participants, event phrase, cal-endar date, and event type. The news event extrac-tor (Li et al., 2013) is a joint framework based on structured prediction which extracts triggers and ar-guments simultaneously while incorporating diverse lexical, syntactic, semantic and global features. It takes raw documents as input, distinguish events from non-events by classifying event triggers and identifying and classifying argument roles. 3.2 Knowledge Enrichment Approach To produce the latent vector representations for the whole dataset, we follow the same procedure in (Guo et al., 2013): represent the dataset in a ma-trix X, where each cell stores the TF-IDF values of words. Word vectors P and tweet vectors Q are op-timized by minimizing the following objective func-tion: where  X  is a regularization term, Q  X  ,j are linked pairs connected by text-to-text relations, | Q  X  ,j | denotes the length of vector Q  X  ,j and the co-efficient  X  denotes the importance of the text-to-text links. we follow the same optimization procedure as (Steck, 2010) by alternating Least Square [ALS] is used for inference on P and Q .

After obtaining the vector representations for the whole dataset, for each tweet, we retrieve its cross-genre knowledge by finding the news article with the highest cosine similarity. 4.1 Data Description We use the same dataset as (Guo et al., 2013) which contains 34,888 tweets and 12,704 news articles. For each tweet, we consider the url-referred news article as its gold standard cross-genre knowledge  X  the most relevant news document. As the news event extractor is designed for a closed set of 33 event types (ace, 2005) while the tweet event extrac-tor is for open domain, in this paper we only focus on the tweet-news pairs that the news event extrac-tion output is not empty. We randomly selected 50 tweet-news pairs for the cross-genre event extraction annotation and evaluation. 4.2 Experiment Results Figure 1, 2 and 3 present the Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-measure (F) of the overall event extrac-tion performance for different settings respectively. From these experiment results, we have the follow-ing four observations: 1. Event Extraction solely on tweet messages achieves the lowest precision, recall and f-measure. It exactly confirms our motivation of conducting knowledge enrichment for event extraction in tweet messages. Because of the informal nature of tweet messages, the event extractor misidentified 54.16% of the events thus the precision is low. Take the ill-formatted tweet in Section 1 as an example, the named entity  X  X aronSwartz X  is in the hashtag  X #AaronSwartz X  and  X  X ead at 26 X  is written as  X  X ead @ 26 X . It makes the automatic event extrac-tor extremely difficult to identify the  X  X ie X  event for the person  X  X aron Swartz X .

The low recall is mainly caused by the  X  X ack of context X  problem. Due to the length limitation of tweets, users tend to use recapitulate languages to describe an event. For Example, the following tweet  X  X ell. That sucks.  X  X eepening Crisis for the Boe-ing 787 X  X  actually refers to an  X  X mergency land-ing X  event made by  X  X ll Nippon Airways X  in  X  X est-ern Japan X . The user only mentioned the summary  X  X eepening Crisis for the Boeing 787 X  to refer to the actual event. Therefore, the single-genre event extractor missed the event trigger  X  X anding X  and the event arguments  X  X ll Nippon Airways X  and  X  X est-ern Japan X . 2. Both single-genre event extractors can con-tribute to the cross-genre event extractor through the cross-genre linking process. Even with the auto-matic linking output, Figure 2 and Figure 3 show 29.9% recall and 14.0% f-measure improvement over single-genre event extractor for tweets. It is because that in most cases, news articles cover more information than tweets as they are produced by pro-fessional news agencies while tweets are written by individuals with a 140-character length limitation. In the following example, although referring to the same events, the news article covers more event in-formation than the tweet, thus the cross-genre event extractor can surpass the single-genre event extrac-tor for tweets.

For some certain cases, the cross-genre event ex-tractor is also able to benefit from single-genre event extractor for tweets. For the following example, the event extractor for news articles missed the  X  X t-tack X  event as  X  X alt an ... Advance X  is an un-usual phrase to describe an  X  X ttack X  event. How-ever, in the related tweet,  X  X attling X  is a strong indicator of an  X  X ttack X  event and the event ex-tractor for tweets is able to catch it. As a re-sult, we are able to extract the overall event tu-ples { EventPhrase=[Advance,Battling], EventPatic-ipant=[France,Islamist,Mali] } .
 3. Either improving single-genre event extractors or achieving better cross-genre linking performance is able to boost the overall event extraction perfor-mance. From Figure 1, 2 and 3, we can observe that higher quality of single-genre event extractors will significantly enhance the precision while bet-ter linking performance will mainly contribute to a higher recall. 4. Compared with cross-genre linking accuracy, the quality of single-genre event extractors is more important. Figure 3 shows that  X  X old Event Extrac-tor + System Linking X  achieved 26.3% higher F-measure score than  X  X ystem Event Extractor + Gold Linking X . It is mainly because of two reasons: on one hand, the errors of single-genre event extractors will be propagated to the final event output; on the other hand, the current linking system is able to pro-vide reasonable linking results thus the use of per-fect linking will not have too much gain. Linking Errors: mistakenly linking tweets to irrel-evant news articles. For example, the tweet  X  X he lack of investigative movement -his return and his flippant attitude is what is insulting. Not his new placement. X  is about a  X  X ovement X  event that As-semblyman returns to Albany after scandal. How-ever, the tweets express the event so implicitly that the automatic linking system is not able to discover its corresponding news article.
 Extraction Errors: single-genre event extractors failed on both the tweet side and the news arti-cle side. For the following example, both single genre event extractors missed the  X  X hreaten X  event between the vice president Hugo Chvez and those questioning the legitimacy of Chavez X  X  government . Tweet: #Venezuela VP warns those questioning the legitimacy of #Chavez X  X  government:  X  X atch your words and your actions. X  News: The vice president threatened action against any who question the legality of delaying the swearing-in of President Hugo Chvez, who is still in Cuba. In this paper we study the bottlenecks of event ex-traction for tweets. We have two observations: (1). Because of the  X  X ack of context X  and  X  X nformal na-ture X  characteristics of tweets, conducting event ex-traction solely on tweet messages cannot produce satisfactory results; (2) The events embedded in tweets and news articles are often complementary. Based on these observations, we proposed to link each tweet to its most relevant news article, and further incorporated this cross-genre knowledge to conduct cross-genre event extraction. Experiment results showed that without any additional annota-tion, our proposed cross-genre event extractor is able to outperform state-of-the-art tweet event extraction. Our future research will focus on joint modeling of cross-genre event extraction in the training stage through cross-genre knowledge enrichment.
