Doubt is not a pleasant condition, but certainty is absurd.
Schema matching is the task of providing correspondences between concepts describing the meaning of data in various heterogeneous, distributed data sources ( e.g. attributes in database schemata, tags in XML DTDs, fields in HTML forms, input and output parameters in Web services, etc. ). Schema matching is one of the basic operations required by the process of data and schema integration, and thus has great effect on its outcomes, whether these involve tar-geted content delivery, view integration, database integra-tion, query rewriting over heterogeneous sources, duplicate data elimination, or automatic streamlining of workflow ac-tivities that involve heterogeneous data sources. As such, schema matching affects numerous modern applications from a wide variety of areas. It impacts business, where company data sources continuously realign due to changing markets; and it affects the way business and other information con-sumers seek information over the Web. It impacts the life sciences, where scientific workflows cross system boundaries more often than not. Finally, it impacts the way communi-ties of knowledge are created and evolve.

Schema matching research has been going on for more than 25 years now, first as part of schema integration and then as a standalone research field. Over the years, a sig-nificant body of work has been devoted to the identification of schema matchers , heuristics for schema matching. The main objective of schema matchers is to provide correspon-dences that will be effective from the user X  X  point of view, yet computationally efficient (or at least not disastrously expen-sive). These have come out of a variety of different research communities, including database management, information retrieval, the information sciences, data semantics and the semantic Web, and others.

Over the years, a realization has emerged that schema matchers are inherently uncertain. A matcher may consider several possible correspondences as possible, and when it needs to choose, it may choose wrong. For example, when two companies merge, the companies X  employee databases need to be consolidated. The schemata may be different, and in such a case, there may be many different ways of map-ping one schema to another. As another example, a Web search engine performing a product search over databases of multiple vendors needs to find correspondences between the product databases of different vendors. Multiple ways of representing the data might lead to multiple possible cor-respondences.

A prime reason for the uncertainty of the matching process is the enormous ambiguity and heterogeneity of data descrip-tion concepts: It is unrealistic to expect a single matcher to identify the correct mapping for any possible concept in a set. Uncertainty in schema matching was recognized first in the form of anecdotal comments in research papers. Since 2003, work on the uncertainty in schema matching has picked up (along with research on uncertainty in other areas of data management).

This tutorial presents various aspects of uncertainty in schema matching within a single unified framework. We in-troduce basic formulations of uncertainty and provide sev-eral alternative representations of schema matching uncer-tainty. Then, we cover two common methods that have been proposed to deal with uncertainty in schema match-ing, namely ensembles and top-K matchings, and analyze them in this context. We conclude with a set of real-world applications and in particular, the use of uncertain schema matching in NisB, a European project that is aimed at har-nessing an evolving Wisdom of the Network to dynamically connect businesses to attain common business goals.
