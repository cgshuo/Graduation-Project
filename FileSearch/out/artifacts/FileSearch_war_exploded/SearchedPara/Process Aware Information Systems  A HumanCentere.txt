 A Process Aware Information System (PAIS) is a software system that manages and executes operational processes involving people, applications, and/or infor-mation sources on the basis of an explicit imbedded process model. The model is typically instantiated many times, and every instance is typically handled in a predefined way. Thus this definition shows that a typical text editor is not process aware, and likewise a typical e-mail client is not process aware. In both of these examples, the software is performing a task, but is not aware that the task is part of a process. Note that the explicit representation of process allows automated enactment, automated verification, and automated redesign; all of which can lead to increased organizational efficiency. Other potential benefits of PAISareelaboratedin[1].

An increasingly large population of diverse humans is interacting with technol-ogy these days; it is therefore increasingly important for computerized systems to address issues of human interaction / collaboration. The incorporation of process into information systems is particularly challenging because most PAIS involve processes performed by people. People p rocesses are complex, semi-structured, and dynamically changing. Within PAIS design, it is thus necessary to take into account factors that impinge upon the organizational structures, the social context, the cultural setting, and other dimensions.

This paper first introduces examples an d concepts of collective endeavors not-ing characteristics that ca n be quite challenging to capture within process de-scriptions. In the following sections, a framework for analysis, enactment, and mining is described; then a multidimensional meta-model is introduced. The paper ends with summary and conclusions. This section discusses issues related to collective endeavors in a broad sense. It introduces the complexity and variability of collective group interactions through examples, and discusses how structure can be identified in these interactions. It remains true that  X  X ow people work i s one of the best kept secrets X  (David Wellman; cited by Suchman [18]). Collectiv e work is characterized by its fluidity and complex weaving of organizational, social, political, cultural and emotional aspects. Interaction at work takes a wide variety of forms. Consider for instance the following examples: Extreme Collaboration. Mark[12] describes a  X  X ar room X  environment em-
Collaboration is prompted by a complex combination of physical awareness, by monitoring of the parallel conversations in the noisy environment and in response to data that is published through customized networked spreadsheets that allow team members to publish data they produce and subscribe to data published by others. Team members move around the room to consult other specialists, or flock to the public display to discuss problems of their interest. Their movements impart important awareness information to others in the room, which may choose to join a group based on the perceived dependencies of ones own work on what a specific set of specialists is discussing. While working, team members are peripherally aware of multiple simultaneous conversations and react to keywords that concern their part of the job by giving short answers from their workplace or moving to join a group. Finally, data that is made available through the computerized spread sheet system may also trigger collaboration.
 Congressional Sessions. These are highly formalized interactions based on Policy making and design. Horst Rittel [14] discusses the inherently intrac-
Rittel [13] proposes tackling wicked problems through an argumentative method in which questions are continually raised, and advantages and disad-vantages of multiple possible responses are discussed. The method, called Issue Based Information Systems (IBIS) is based on documenting and relating issues, positions about issues, and arguments that either support a position or object to it. Each separate issue is the root of a (possibly empty) tree, with the children of the issue being positions and the children of the positions being arguments. Links among these three basic elements are labeled, e.g. issues and positions are connected by responds-to links; argumen ts are connected to positions either by supports or objects-to links.

An IBIS discussion starts with the elicitation of one or more (abstract) issues, to which participants respond with positions, arguments and refine into more concrete sub-issues. Contradictory posi tions are resolved by consensus or voting. The end result is a forest of linked elements that represent the evolution of the discussion, alternatives that were considered and the rationale for decisions.
In all the above examples, the actual interactions represent a small fraction of a much larger interaction over time and space. The members of the extreme collaboration team at NASA have been working together for many years, and have detailed knowledge of each others p eculiarities and expertise. They also share common engineering knowledge of their field, as well as the common ap-proaches and problem solving strategies that are part of the cultural heritage of their field. As for the congressional session s, these represent just the visible tip of the political iceberg; complex backstage negotiations shape the performance at the session and result from economic and political pressures of a multitude of stake-holders. Finally, the policy making and design based on IBIS is guided by a deep understanding of the issues in discussion that the participants bring to the interaction based on a lifetime of exp eriences, shared or not, and by expert opinion and supporting documentation that is sought as part of the process. All these interaction contexts are in turn embedded in larger societal settings, as parts of organizations, the government, as part of a nation, and so on.
Although these examples are all extra cted from work life, clearly the com-plexity and variability exhibited here also extends to human interaction beyond work environments. Although complete details of interactions and the intricate factors that govern them are usually beyond what can be understood, constituting implicit processes that are mostly inaccessible, certain emer gent regularities and patterns of group behavior can be observed. Rather than being unconstrained, interactions usually follow a structure that is repetitively r eproduced by participants at each new in-stance [10,11]. This structure is a result of shared belief and value systems, and is frequently learned from previous experiences of participants in similar situa-tions. This structure reinforces the enacted behaviors, helping to shape future interactions. More than repeating patterns, participants make implicit or ex-plicit statements about/through their actions, as they go about their activities. Participants exert  X  X eflective self-moni toring X  [10] so as to act accountably, i.e. in a manner that is  X  X bservable-and-reportable X  [9]. Acting accountably means acting explicitly (even if unconsciously) according to values and rules shared by a social group, that get at the same time instantiated and reinforced by actions of individuals [16]. Participation in interactions may be constrained by organi-zational rules, goals, and norms. Participants are able to make sense of each other X  X  actions (and reorient their own accordingly) because individual actions are recognizable by the group as being one of the meaningful actions that are sensible within a context. Bittner [4] suggests that  X  X  good deal of the sense we make of things happening in our presence depends on our ability to assign them to the phenomenal sphere of influence of some rule. X  Participation in in-teractions is further constrained to speci fic sets of behaviors that are associated to the roles played by participants (e.g . teacher, student; m eeting chair, meet-ing participant). Roles to some extent d etermine the behaviors of any person occupying a certain position within a context, independently of personal char-acteristics [2,3]. Some of these roles may be non-institutionalized and sometimes even pathological, e.g. the devil X  X  advocate, and the scapegoat respectively.
The linguistic interchanges among participants of an interaction can be seen as forming an elaborate game as well, where each speech act [17] constrains and directs subsequent acts. Intuitively, the act of asking a question is bound to elicit some response related to the nature of this question, even if indirectly. Searle [17] and others associated to the language/action perspective (e.g. [5,7,19]) identify a set of illocutionary points that would constitute the essential components of conversations for actions. Individual act s are inter-related into acceptable  X  X ove sequences X , so that e.g. a request by a p articipant can be accepted, declined, or counter-offered. Each of these in turn has its possible continuations, e.g. a counter-offer can be accepted, the original request might be canceled, or a new counter-offer might be generated [17]. Co llective discourses thus display struc-ture and can be equated to an evolving process. In practical terms that means that interactions, even seemingly unstructured ones, are regulated by linguistic, social and cultural norms that dictate to a large extent the way interactions are  X  X layed out X . In other words, interactions constitute social processes. Such processes take place at many distinct levels, embedded within each other in a recursive structure. Debate and voting, for instance, can be considered sub pro-cesses within a meeting in which they occu r; meetings in turn are part of larger processes within organizations, which are embedded within yet larger organiza-tional and societal settings.

This paper next focuses upon a framework and meta-model for multi-dimensional PAIS analyses and enactment. These PAISs tend to have a high degree of complex human involvement, wh ich poses special challenges to tech-nological augmentation. In general, a framework is a way of thinking; it is a way of conceptualizing an area of endeavor. It sometimes allows one to categorize, and to see the bigger picture within which studies, research, and development is being performed. A useful effect of a framework can be intro duction of a means of communication, comparison, evaluation, and synthesis. PAIS mining is concerned with enterprize analysis via automated inspection of organizational work logs. In the fledgling area of PAIS mining, different developer s have different terminology and dif-ferent methodologies. There is a need at this time for synthesis. The stage is set for productive communication, comparison, and combination. We hope this framework helps.

Most PAIS mining research is narrowly aimed at the rediscovery of explicit control flow models. We believe that this approach limits the scope and utility of PAIS mining. It is indeed true that PAIS technology is highly concerned with process execution, analysis, and improvement; but to address these process concerns adequately, it is frequently n ecessary to take into account the larger picture of social and organizational structures, goals, and resources. Thus, PAIS mining needs to be concerned with gathering and discovering useful information about the organizational processes, and also the social structures that support these processes. We would like to extend the mining domain to give serious effort to mining of data-flow information, of organizational information, of human and social information, and of other persp ectives. In this section, we introduce a framework that enables and facilitates PAIS mining in this broader sense.
In general, we consider PAIS mining to be a sub-area of Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD). KDD is concerned with ext racting knowledge from stored data. The KDD process consists of (1) understanding the domain, (2) data selection, (3) data cleaning, (4) data transformation, (5) data mining, and (6) result inter-pretation/evaluation [23]. Conceiving PAIS mining in these broader terms opens up new vistas of possibility. A particularly important phase forPAIS is the data mining step in KDD. Data mining is the process of fitting models to, or discov-ering patterns from, stored data [23]. These models can be either statistical or logical. Statistical models are inherently nondeterministic, while logical models are purely deterministic. The selection of a model for data mining primarily de-pends on the knowledge discovery goal. In general, knowledge discovery goals are either descriptive or predictive. If the knowledge discovery goal is descriptive, the data mining step aims at finding a model that can describe the stored data in a human interpretable form. If the knowledge discovery goal is predictive, data mining aims at discovering a model that is used to predict some future behavior. Some useful techniques for discovering descriptive and predictive models are: 1. Classification: A function that maps data elements into predefined classes. 2. Clustering: A function that maps data elements into their natural classes. 3. Summarization: A function that summarizes the data elements (i.e. mean) 4. Dependency Modeling: A technique that attempts to define structural rela-5. Anomaly Detection: A technique that focuses on detecting patterns that
Data mining, in the context of PAIS, is concerned with using the entire set of discovery techniques mentioned above to gain useful knowledge about an organizational process from an event log. However, in this paper we will focus on the discovery of a logical descriptive model via the dependency modeling technique.

In order to put the PAIS mining step in KDD in its proper context, we must understand its interfaces. The interfaces to the PAIS mining step are the output of the data transformation step, an event log, and the input of the result inter-pretation/evaluation step, a PAIS model. When given an event log, WL , generated by a set of process instances, I , and the knowledge discovery goal of finding a logical descriptive model of WL , a PAIS mining algorithm attempts to discover a complete and consistent model, M , with respect to WL . Completeness of a PAIS model means that the discovered model can describe all of the event sequences and salient relationships in WL without simply enumerating them. Consistency means that the discovered workflow model only describes the event sequences and relationships in WL (or ones that are  X  X onsistent X  with WL ) and does not introduce superfluous or spurious event sequences. Stated more plainly, a PAIS mining algorithm accepts as input an event log and produces as output a com-plete and consistent PAIS model.

The details of the log are dependent upon the details of the particular family of models. Thus, in the next section, we describe our PAIS meta-model. Different organizations have different goals, different resources, and different needs for automated assistance within th eir business processes. Therefore, dif-ferent organizations typically need different workflow products, different CSCW tools, different mining techniques, and di fferent models to express different busi-ness perspectives. The concept of a me ta-model provides a coherent, uniform notation and a set of conceptual tools for creating various models appropriate to various organizations.

A comprehensive PAIS representation language is defined in [24] as a repre-sentation language that can be used to express the major organizational per-spectives from which to examine a proce ss. The Information Control Net (ICN) is an open-ended, graphical formalism conceived over 25 years ago (by one of the co-authors of this paper) as a family of models for organizational process de-scription, analyses, and implementation[21,22]. In the Collaboration Technology Research Group (CTRG) at the University of Colorado, and the Collaboration Technology Research Lab (CTRL) at Kyonggi University in Korea, there has been ongoing research concerned with ICN s. In this section, we combine and ex-tend ideas of comprehensive PAIS repres entation languages with ICN concepts to present a meta-model suitable for multidimensional PAIS mining .

The heart of the ICN meta-model is the observation that understanding of organizational processes begins with understanding of organizational goals, structures, and resources. Thus, in order to create a specific model of a specific enterprize, a modeler chooses certain ob jects of interest and structures from an organizational framework, from an organizational schema, and from an orga-nizational net. The organizational framework is used to specify various classes of organizational objects (e.g. goals, constraints, resources, activities). The or-ganizational schema is used to specify the set of mappings over the classes of organizational objects (e.g. who does wha t, which activities precede which). The organizational net is used to specify the dynamic behavior of an organization.
Within the ICN modeling methodology, basic workflow areas are organized as object sets called dimensions which are the n organized into perspectives. Dimen-sions of interest might include the activities dimension (e.g. tasks done within an organization), the data dimension (e.g. descriptions of what information is used within the organization), the participants dimension (e.g. who are the human em-ployees), and the roles dimension (e.g. job descriptions such as secretary and man-ager). In our related research document [26], we argue that our models and our research must incorporate more than the above standard dimensions. Our meta-model builds in extensibility to choose models incorporating various perspectives. The following is a partial list of important perspectives for incorporation:  X  Functional perspective,  X  Structural perspective,  X  Dataflow perspective,  X  Social perspective,  X  Organizational perspective,  X  Role/Actor perspective,  X  Reputational perspective,  X  Cultural perspective,  X  Security perspective,  X  Political perspective,  X  Inter-organizational e nterprize perspective.

More formally, a dimension is defined as a set of homogeneous objects (e.g. employees), a set of attributes associat ed with objects (e.g. employees X  ages), a set of zero or more automorphisms (relationships, such Abe reports to Bob) on the object set, and a set of constraints (rules that all employees must obey) asso-ciated with the automorphisms. When we inter-relate the organizational objects of one or more dimensions, we form an organizational perspective . Organizational models are constructed by se lecting dimensions of inter est, and relating them via mappings (multi-valued relationships) and constraints to form perspectives. A multidimensional PAIS model for an enterprize is defined as an interrelated fam-ily of models, each depicting a perspective on the enterprize.

For example, in studying PAIS for collective endeavors, it is possible to relate the organizational objects of the activities dimension, activities, to the organi-zational objects of other dimensions. To the extent that an activity is actually captured in its processes, these types of relationships give insight into what an organization does. As another example, a data flow perspective is formed when we impose relationships between three dimensions: activities, data items, and repositories. Data dependence is one useful mapping in this perspective; it reveals the data dependencies of activities. Another example of interest is the activity assignment perspective formed by defining a set of relationships between three dimensions: employees, roles, and acti vities. Depending on the size and nature of an organization, the dimensions involved in the definition of this perspective can vary. For a small organization, with two people and a relatively simple pro-cess, it is probably quite adequate and convenient to relate participants directly to the activities they perform. However, in organizations with significant com-plex interactions, this type of relationship is very impractical [25]; it is more appropriate to relate activities to roles, then relate those roles to participants. Therefore, through one level o f indirection, activities ar e related to participants. Mining this perspective in a small organization is typically easy and intuitive, but in a large complex organization, it may be quite nontrivial. Also, we have found within our research group that formulation of multiple related models of the cultural perspective [26] are challenging, but quite promising.
 In summary, people oriented PAISs are important because they focus upon socio-technical issues within information systems. An increasingly large population of diverse humans is interacting with technology these days; it is therefore increas-ingly important for systems to address issues of person-to-person collaboration. The incorporation of people perspectives into PAIS models is particularly chal-lenging because people processes are complex, semi-structured, and dynamically changing. It is thus necessary to take into account factors that impinge upon the organizational structures, the social context, and the cultural setting.
This leads to the question of  X  X hen should an organization move to process aware technology? X  There is an issue of goodness of fit of technology to process. Examples have been observed of significa nt gains in efficiency and effectiveness by the incorporation of process aware systems [6]. For example, in some of these cases, the ability of people to view the current state of the entire process has been extremely valuable. Examples have also been observed of cumbersome inhibition of people work by overly inflexible information systems imposing strict process orderings. In some of these cases, the ability of people to get their work done in a timely fashion has been seriousl y impeded by unnecessary formality and complexity introduced by the system [8] . In general, process aware technology is most useful in situations of non-trivial multi-person collaborative processes that are regularly followed within a st ructured stable environment.

In this paper, we discussed a framework and a multidimensional organiza-tional meta-model as a means of analysis and enactment of PAIS for collective endeavors. We hope that in the near future, there is enhanced research on further dimensions and perspectives.

We envision many future benefits of well designed people oriented PAIS tech-nology. Some interesting fledgling examples of this technology are being in-vestigated in research laboratories today. For example, role based information systems can help to partition complexity: affective computing techniques enable virtual agents to actively participate in group communications in a fashion that is familiar and natural to humans, rather than requiring people to learn details of the technology X  X  interface. Also, multimedia and multimodal systems are be-coming feasible, available, and useful. As organizations become more distributed and intertwined, we see an increasing need for intelligent process technology. We see exciting research progress, and significantly enhanced technology in the future. A thoughtful marriage of information technology and social science is necessary to produce information systems that are functionally aware, socially aware, culturally aware, and truly process aware.
