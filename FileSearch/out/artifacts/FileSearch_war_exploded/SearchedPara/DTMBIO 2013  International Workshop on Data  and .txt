 The organizers of ACM Seventh International Workshop on Data and Text Mining in Biomedical Informatics (DTMBIO 13) are pleased to announce that the seventh DTMBIO will be held in conjunction with CIKM, one of the largest data management conferences. The major interests of DTMBIO are on the state-of-the-art applications of data and text mining on biomedical research problems. DTMBIO 13 will be a forum of discussing and exchanging informatics related techniques and problems in the context of biomedical research.

The biomedical data repos itories include data in a wide variety of forms, including genom ic sequences, gene expression profiles, proteomics, metabolomic s, epigenomics, microbiomics, electronics medical records, literature information, and so on. The ability to automatically and effectively extract, integrate, understand and make use of in formation embedded in such heterogeneous -structured and unstructured -data remains a challenging task. The aim of the 2013 workshop has been to bring together researchers in the areas of data and text mining and computational biology, who are interested in integrating and analyzing heterogeneous, structured and unstructured data. world. The selection process wa s highly competitive. Each paper went through a rigorous double-blinded peer review by at least 3 members of the Program Committee. Based on the referee reports, the papers have been ranked according to their original contribution, and the program committee accepted 3 papers and 8 extended abstracts (which will be invited to a supplement issue of BMC Decision Making and Medical Informatics) that cover a variety of topics, including novel information extraction techniques, ontologies, and applica tion to large biomedical data. In addition, the program includes a keynote speech by Professor Atul Butt at Stanford Univeristy . We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable referen ce for researchers and developers who are interested in applying Text Mining to Medical Informatics. and text mining techniques in c linical settings. [6] presents a prototype that recognizes abbreviations and provides a ranked list of possible senses for each abbreviation while clinicians write notes in real time. Clinical abbreviations are highly ambiguous, and the proposed technique to resolve the meaning of an abbreviation in real time is a good strategy for the problem of ambiguity of clinical abbreviations. [1] describes a process of applying an MER for effective IR from clinical reports. It presents performance evaluation for the MER and IR on the TREC datasets. [11] describes a study in which clustering of free-text clinical narrative is used to try to identify clinical documents from particular specialties. [5] proposes an automated approach based on semantic query expansion and formal concept analysis to enable users to specify their health outcomes of interest using plain terms. The approach aims initially for greater coverage and relies on user feedback to improve relevance. mining to medical informatics. [8] proposes a novel dictionary-based approach to biomedical named entity recognition. [4] introduces DBMS-based Bayesian variable selection (VS) method. The method was application on miRNA and mRNA expression data to modeling the su rvival time of patients suffering Glioblastoma Multiforme. [2] describes a new local binding site search system, called Fast Patch-Surfer, which is based on the landmark MultiDimensional Sca ling (MDS). Results are promising, with a huge reduction in processing time. [3] suggests to incorporate brain pathway information into AD classification, and experimentally shows that the brain pathway actually produce better classification accuracy. [7] describes an interesting rule-based and multi-scale modeling language. This language is unfortunately only presented in a limited way, and the type 2 diabetes mellitus use case and experiment has only barely discussed results. [9] presented an similar analysis between breast and prostate cancer expression us ing SVM based ensemble gene selection. [10] presents a hybrid approach to extracting drug names from biomedical text, co mbining dictionary-and an ontology-based approaches. organized in conjunction with CIKM in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. We invite researchers and practitioners from a variety of backgrounds such as computer science, information system, information sc ience, bioinformatics, medical informatics, and medical sciences. The main objective of the workshop will be to strengthen the cooperation within the growing community in medical da ta and text mining research, allowing lively exchange of ideas and foster new collaborations.
