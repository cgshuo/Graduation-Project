 } A web page may be relevant to multiple topics; even when nom-inally on a single topic, the page may attract attention (and thus links) from multiple communities. Instead of indiscriminately sum-ming the authority provided by all pages, we decompose a web page into separate subnodes with respect to each community point-ing to it. By considering the relevance of these communities, we are able to better model the query-specific reputation for each potential result. We apply a total of 125 queries to the TREC .GOV dataset to demonstrate how the use of community relevance can improve ranking performance.

Web search engines have adopted several different sources of evidence to rank web pages matching a user query, such as textual content and the link structure of the web. The latter is particularly beneficial in helping to address the abundance of relevant docu-ments on the Web by determining the authority of a page based on the links that point to it. PageRank and HITS are the two funda-mental link analysis approaches, both of which treat all hyperlinks equally and assess a page X  X  quality by summing the incoming au-thority flows indiscriminately. However, hyperlinks are not identi-cal; they may be created in different contexts and represent different opinions. For example, a news website normally contains articles on multiple topics and may have links from different sources.These links convey endorsement in different topics, and mixing them in-discriminately, as traditional link analysis usually does, will hinder an understanding of web page reputations. As a result, a page will be assigned a generic score to tell whether it is good, fair or bad; but we will have no idea whether a popular page is good for  X  X ports X  or  X  X rts X , given it is textually related to both.

We argue that it is more helpful to determine the authority of a resource with respect to some topic or community than in general. To achieve this, we propose a novel ranking model X  link to a resource, CommunityRank can track and weight the con-tribution from each community. Thus it avoids the problem of a heavily linked page getting highly ranked on a topic for which it is not authoritative, yielding more accurate search results.
We decompose each web page into several community-specific subnodes so that authority from a particular community only flows into the corresponding subnode. The re-organized hyperlink struc-ture gives a more accurate and robust representation of the relation-ships on the Web.

A community is defined as a subset of parents to a page that link to the target in a similar context. By representing that context, the task of community identification is mapped into clustering contexts of links to a common page. Although many methods could repre-sent a hyperlink X  X  context, in this work we represent it by the full contents of the document containing the hyperlink. Clustering such contexts can be an expensive process, and in our model needs to be applied to the set of parents for each document in the collection. In our current implementation, we adopt a simplification: we prede-fine twelve categories, chosen from the top level of the dmoz Open Directory Project (ODP) [6], and use a textual classifier ( X  X ain-bow X  [3], trained on 19,000 pages from each of twelve categories) to determine the category of each context. In this way, the contexts of hyperlinks to a given node are placed into one or more communi-ties based on their classification labels. With this simplification, we replace real communities by predefined coarse-grained categories. We expect to further investigate ways to define and identify more realistic communities in the future.

With the community disambiguation process in place, the next step is to split pages into community-specific subnodes and set up the network among them. As Figure 1 demonstrates, the node Figure 1: Splitting web nodes to reflect parent communities. is split into two independent subnodes, e.g. A X and A it is linked from two communities represented by topics X and Y. The link structure present among the original nodes must now be mapped to the community-specific subnodes. For the purpose o f separating authority flows on different topics, incoming li nks are distributed only to the subnode corresponding to the parent commu-nity. In contrast, outgoing links are duplicated across all subnodes so that the total authority flow passed on to the original node  X  X  chil-dren remains approximately the same as before splitting int o subn-odes. As shown in the right part of Figure 1, links from commun ity X and Y are directed to A X and A Y respectively, while the outgo-ing links A  X  E and A  X  F are replicated in each subnode.
Through community decomposition, we expand the normal web graph into a community-based subnode graph. By applying Pag e-Rank on this new graph, every subnode will have a traditional au-thority score based on its associated community. Given a par ticular query q , a query-specific importance score for each web page can be achieved by summing the scores of subnodes that belong to a page weighted by their affinity to this query. To measure the a ffin-ity, we use Rainbow to generate a probability distribution f or the query q across the predefined categories.
The main goal of the proposed CommunityRank is to improve the quality of web search. Thus we compare the search results of four ranking algorithms to our proposed Community Rank (CR): Okapi BM25 [7], traditional PageRank (PR), Topic-Sen sitive PageRank (TSPR) [2] and Topical PageRank (T-PR) [4]. BM25 and PR are used as baselines; we additionally chose TSPR and T -PR because, similar to our model, they measure a page X  X  reput ation with respect to different topics. Unlike CR, TSPR and T-PR in cor-porate topics within the random surfer model. In particular , TSPR restricts each topic-specific web surfer to jump to pages on t he same topic rather than to any page in the Web. Topical PageRank tra cks the topics seen by a single surfer. In contrast, our approach essen-tially utilizes the original random surfer model, but incor porates content by considering community-specific query relevance .
We rank all documents using a linear combination of the BM25 score [7] (configured as in [1]) and the authority score gener ated by the link analysis approaches. In our implementation, the com-bination is order-based, where ranking positions based on a uthor-ity score (weighted by 0.05) and IR score (weighted by 0.95) a re summed together.

We conduct experiments on the TREC GOV collection, which is a 2002 crawl of 1.25M web pages from the .gov domain. To test various ranking algorithms on the GOV corpus, we chose t he topic distillation task in the web track of TREC 2003 and TREC 2004, which contains 50 queries and 75 queries respectively . These tasks provide relevance judgments, from which we calculate P@10, NDCG@10, MAP and Rprec for performance comparison.

Figure 2 shows the performance comparison for TREC 2003. CR exceeds all other approaches on all metrics. T-PR and TSPR al so outperform the baseline results. To determine whether thes e im-provements are statistically significant, we performed sin gle-tailed t-tests to compare CR with all other approaches on the P@10 me t-ric. CR significantly exceeds PageRank (p-value=0.045) and BM25 (p-value=0.03) at the 95% confidence level.
 For experiments in TREC 2004, CR slightly outperforms PR. Both TSPR and T-PR do not work well on TREC, with performance even lower than PR. The t-test shows that CR significantly out per-forms TSPR (P-value = 0.0002), T-PR (P-value = 0.04) and BM25 (P-value = 0.003) at a 95% confidence level for P@10. In contra st, CR and PR are statistically indistinguishable.

We have proposed a novel community ranking algorithm which decomposes the web graph into a community-based subnode gra ph on which query-specific reputations are calculated. Experi mental results indicate that our approach improves ranking perfor mance.
We expect to further study different choices for clustering , the effects of link weights, and to apply this model on query-spe cific datasets. We would also like to consider how to describe the r epu-tation of a page within the communities in which it is found.
