 Financial markets are quite sensitive to unanticipated news and events. Identifying the effect of news on the market is a challenging task. In this demo, we present Forex-foreteller (FF) which mines news articles and makes forecasts about the movement of foreign currency markets. The system uses a combination of language models, topic clustering, and sen-timent analysis to identify relevant news articles. These ar-ticles along with the historical stock index and currency ex-change values are used in a linear regression model to make forecasts. The system has an interactive visualizer designed specifically for touch-sensitive devices which depicts fore-casts along with the chronological news events and financial data used for making the forecasts.

Foreign market exchanges are among of the most liquid financial markets in the world. According to the Bank of International Settlements, the average daily turnover is esti-mated at $3.98 trillion as of April 2010 with a growth of 20% as compared to April 2007. Traders include governments, fi-nancial institutions and retail investors. Currency exchange rates are the most important aspect of international trade and investments. In an increasingly challenging and com-petitive market, having an estimate of currency movement is a holy grail. However, the irregular effects of economic, political and environmental factors make currency market forecasting a very complex task. Many traders choose to hedge their currency investments due to such difficulties.
In this demo, we present a novel system for modeling currency exchange rates, which we call Forex-foreteller 1 Forex-foreteller not only makes potential forecasts and gen-erates warnings but also allows traders to view the chrono-logical set of news events and historical financial data used in making forecasts. A visualization has been specifically designed for a large touch screen device. Currently, the sys-tem forecasts currency exchange rates for four Latin Amer-ican countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Columbia, and could easily be extended for other markets, given compara-ble (or greater) data coverage.
Predicting the economic life cycle has been an area of in-tensive research. Prior work discusses several financial time series models such as ARCH models, GARCH models [1], etc. all of which aim to identify subliminal rules governing markets. However relying on just financial time series data may not be sufficient as there are several other factors that might contribute to market fluctuations. Bollen et al. [2] argue that there is a strong correlation between stock mar-ket and public sentiment collected from Twitter. However, since location information is unavailable for around 40% of Twitter users [3], it is difficult to target predictions for a particular country. Preis et al. [4] on the other hand aim to find a link between weekly search engine query data and financial market fluctuations. They use keywords specific to particular companies to make inferences but this is not a good option for making inferences at the country level.
Lavrenko et al. [5] associate news with various stock trends and predict stock fluctuations by matching news pat-terns with trend labels. However, simply aligning news with various trends is too crude to predict specific topics, espe-cially with respect to currency prediction systems which rely on several topic movements. Like Lavrenko et al., we believe that financial markets are sensitive to economic news but are also influenced by a wide variety of unanticipated events. While the market can react strongly to some news, it could remain completely insulated from other financial news. The aim of the FF system is to explore correlative links between news and financial market fluctuations. In particular it iden-tifies cardinal topics from news articles which might have big

The system primarily focuses on capturing significant fluctuations whose absolute value of Zscore (30) (i.e., the number of standard deviation move-ments over the past 30 days) is greater than three in currency exchange rates which we refer to as OSI Events.
As shown in Figure 1, the architecture of the Forex-foreteller system can be divided into two parts: off-line analysis and an on-line audit trail. The off-line analysis stage monitors news sources and employs language models to generate a pool of relevant news articles. Then we apply topic cluster-ing methods and use customized sentiment dictionaries to uncover sentiment trends by analyzing relevant sentences. A linear regression model estimates the weight for each topic and makes currency forecasts. Artifacts from each stage in-cluding related news, topics, historical data, and model coef-ficients sent to the on-line stage along with the final warning for analysis.

Dur ing the on-line stage, as shown in Figure 2, the FF system presents a list of generated alerts which, on selec-tion, displays a dynamically generated graph symbolizing the inputs and outputs of each stage of the warning gen-eration along with views to the actual raw data and news content. With the on-line stage, FF allows a user to analyze the historical financial and news data upon which an alert was founded.
Not all financial news articles will influence a particu-lar currency market (equally) and hence our first goal is to distinguish news articles that can impact currency move-ments. We develop a language model that classifies the in-coming news articles as relevant or not relevant. We collect 361,782 Bloomberg news articles between April 2010 and March 2013. Using the latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model of Blei et al. [6], we classify these news articles into 30 topics and obtain each article X  X  topic distribution. Then, we identify top topics by manually aligning news articles with currency fluctuations, which are labeled as relevant topics. In order to classify incoming news articles, we estimate the topic distribution of each article and then decide whether its most prevalent topics fall into the set of relevant topics identified earlier.
The FF system tries to identify events that may influence the currency market. As explained above, using the LDA model, we obtain each document X  X  topic distribution. Be-cause we have reduced a corpus of news articles into a set of topics, it is straightforward to analyze the dynamics of those topics as a means of gaining insight into general topic distribution (e.g., see [7]). By tracking the topic distribution movement in time series and comparing with the mean topic distribution value, we identify emerging topics.
Interest rates, inflation values, and unanticipated events are all macroscopic indicators which are often reported in the news, either explicitly or implicitly. FF uses a novel approach to measure topic movements and fluctuations us-ing sentiment analysis. The system identifies relevant sen-tences from news articles by filtering through a keyword list and then uses customized sentiment dictionaries to calculate movement (delta) values for interest and inflation rates. In this system, we use the Loughran-McDonald financial dic-tionary [8] to identify relevant keywords about interest rates and inflation values. For identifying unanticipated events, we use the AFINN dictionary [9] which is commonly used to measure large scale general emotions.
In FF system, we use a simple linear regression model to model the relationship between topic movements and cur-rency fluctuations. (More complex models could be sub-stituted here.) Our explanatory variables are interest rate, infl ation, stock and unanticipated events and the dependent variable is the change in currency value. We denote currency change as  X  c , interest rate change as  X  r , inflation change as  X  f , stock market value change as  X  s , and unanticipated events as  X  e . Their respective weights are  X  r ,  X  f ,  X  We use the the previous day X  X  values (previous working day when the currency markets are trading) to forecast a given day X  X  currency movement. Our linear function can be ex-pressed as: We always use the past two weeks historical data to fit the linear model, so each weight can be updated over time to keep up with a changing market.
An important aspect of our system is the preservation and visualization of audit trails, shown in Figure 3. The system preserves all processed data and also provides a vi-sualization. Figure 4 shows the 3-tier database structure for storing audit trails. Raw inputs store article level sentiment scores. Surrogates store stock values along with accumu-lated per-day sentiment scores for events, interest rates, and inflation values. Scores from all the lower tiers are used to generate warnings in the top tier. This structure gives us the flexibility to trace information reduction all the way back to the raw information.
In the off-line FF stage, we have built a flexible, scalable pipeline of components that processes and manages raw data and computes anticipated currency fluctuations, as shown in Figure 5. There are four major component types: stan-dard components, model specific components, queues, and databases. Standard components can be reused by other models and include news collection; enrichment for finding sentence boundaries, word lemmatization, and stemming; a key phrase matcher for matching keywords against our list, and locating their positions in a document; and the language model for classifying news. Queues are used to exchange processed data between different modules. All the compo-nents form a pipeline that begins with the collection of news articles and ends with anticipated currency fluctuations.
There is as expected a trade-off between recall and pre-cision in our experiments. In FF, because we are trying to forecasts future events, we are more interested in high re-call over precision. Using this system, we made predictions for Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Columbia from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2012. The American dollar was used as the baseline currency. Summarized prediction results are shown in Table 1. For example, Columbia had two real three-sigma events and FF generated eight warn-ings, thereby leading to a low precision of 0.25. However, both the real events were correctly forecast leading to a high recall of 1.
A web-based visualization (Figure 3) was developed to present market prediction outcomes, as well as the economic background including historical stock and currency valua-tion s, and relevant news articles. The visualization is com-prised of a context area on the upper half and a details area below. Users can explore predicted OSI events and mini-mize search scope by setting lower and upper bounds with the calender. Once the user has selected an OSI event, a diagram of the inputs and outputs that make up the audit trail will be generated on the left. Historical economic trends that factored into the OSI event, including the original cur-rency and stock values, the standard deviations for each, and values for inflation and interest changes computed from news items are displayed on the left of the details area. To the right the interface shows the news articles relevant to the forecast. Initially, a word cloud of frequent unigrams from all relevant news items is displayed; when a user chooses an article from the list, the right corner will show the con-tent of this news item along with highlighted words that contributed to inflation, interest, and other factors.
Forex-foreteller was able to forecast most of the studied appreciations and depreciations. For instance, the year 2012 saw the Brazilian Real X  X  (BRL) exchange rate significantly altered due to government interventions. On May 21st, the system predicted that the BRL would continue depreciat-ing correctly as per the trends from the previous couple of weeks. However, on May 22nd, as the Brazilian government was intervening to reverse the Real X  X  fall, FF was able to correctly forecast the reversal of the currency movement and predicted that the currency would appreciate. On May 24th it correctly forecast that the currency would appreciate on May 25th. Figures 6 shows the news articles used to make the prediction for May 25th in order to give an idea of how the warning was generated.
