 Email communication in work gr oups and organizations suffers from ill-composed messages. In this paper we introduce two approaches aiming to improve the overall quality of email communication by means of refl ection. For this purpose, we determine, rate and classify qua lity problems as encountered in today's email communication. Subse quently, we derive criteria to rate the quality of email communication, both objectively as well as subjectively. The results of these ratings are then presented to the authors of email messages to encourage them to improve their email communication behaviour. Pre liminary results suggest that our approach might have the potential to overcome problems of email communication caused by ill-composed messages. H.4.3 [ Information Systems Applications ]: Communications Applications -Electronic Mail ; K.4.3 [ Computers and Society ]: Organizational Impacts -Computer-supported Collaborative Work Design, Experimenta tion, Human Factors Electronic Mail, Communication, Quality, Improvement, Feedback, Reflection, Email Communication Behaviour Email has established itself as a common means of interpersonal communication [15]. It is currently the most popular form of computer-mediated communication [1], and the number of users continues to increase. Email ha s proved to be beneficial in bridging time delays, in extending the reach of communication, and in keeping the costs incurred by asynchronous In this paper we present two reflection-based approaches for improving the quality of email communication. Their fundamental goal is to solve the quality problems described above at source, namely in how emails are formulated, structured and categorized by the respective author. Problem-specific feedback to the sender is to initiate a process of improvement and reflection. Applying these appro aches should gradually reduce the problems concerning quality with email communication in work groups and organizations. Reflective methods within learni ng approaches are considered highly relevant [13]. By providing feedback on the basis of email quality criteria accepted by a group, a regulation instrument in the context of the "member support" f unction of the TIP Theory [10] has been investigated. This instrument adjusts the extent to which individual persons can expect advantages from the internal communication. A qualitative improvement can be achieved more easily by means of an anonym ous evaluation, since an open problem solution usually generates more problems than it clarifies. To this extent the s uggested feedback also exerts an influence on the "well being" of the group [10]. Additionally, direct feedback mechanisms are evaluated as a main factor for the richness of media [4]. Different approaches have been proposed by Jackson et. al. [8], Kraut et. al. [7], Maes [9] as well as Whittaker and Sidner [16], that reduce all problems concerning email communication to the notion of information overload. However, these approaches obscure problem solving potential because they do not take into account the possibility of tackling email problems directly at source by providing appropriate feedback. For the management of incoming em ails within current versions of widely used email clients ( Microsoft Outlook, Lotus Notes, Netscape Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird ), "email filters" are used to treat and shift emails in files and/ or delete them. This use of email filters does not support a feedback mechanism. As yet, the email clients provide no appropriate tool s to the email recipients for relaying the qualitative shortcomings of incoming emails to the respective senders. Implicit and explicit quality-assurance methods are commonly used in office communication; they are, however, yet to be extended to include email comm unication. Another bearer of implicit quality assurance is the effort usually put into classical letter correspondence. [11] Here the cost of physical mail acts as a further regulating factor [11]. Despite these positive experiences with quality assurance and adjusti ng measures in the context of formal letter-based corresponde nce, we do not propose such practises as a means for improving the quality of email communication in work groups and organizations due to their impracticality. At present numerous enterprises and organizations are attempting communication by introducing em ail etiquettes ([5], [12]). However, it has to be stated th at the desired goal of lasting improvement in quality is rarely achieved. To grade the importance of each email problem, the respondents were able to select from five categories: "extremely annoying", "disturbing", "in part annoying" , "a little annoying" and "not annoying". These categories are depicted in Table 1 by the small letters "a" (extremely annoying) through to "e" (not annoying). The quality problems in Table 1 are listed according to the weight lent to their relevance R (see right column). The weighting of R is calculated on the basis of the following formula: R = (a)*4 + (b)*3 + (c)*2 + (d)*1 + (e)*0 The identified quality problems within email communication from Table 1 can be assigned to the following four problem classes: 1. Shortcomings of the email content : problems no. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 17, 20, 24, 25 and 27. 2. Shortcomings of the email form : problems no. 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 19, 21, 26, 28 and 30-32. 3. Irrelevant information and/or wrong recipient : problems no. 10, 15, 16, 23 and 29. 4. Problems concerning the right handling : problems no. 7, 8, 11, 18 and 22. Class 1 contains the five highe st weighted shortcomings of emails; the textual and content-specific aspects are thus felt to be extremely annoying and burdensom e. Classes 1 and 2 contain altogether 68.75% of all identified problems as well as the six problems regarded as the most annoying and burdensome. The root cause of the problems covered by these two classes is the author of the email. This corrobor ates the results from [11]. Email senders are not always able to avoid the shortcomings identified in Classes 3 and 4. Applying the two approaches, and so ensuring an appropriate feedback, shoul d enhance the email sender X  X  anticipation of possible problems and pitfalls, enabling them to counter the problems of the Classe s 3 and 4. A solely technical solution to the quality problems of email communication is not possible also because of cultural differences. To improve the quality of email communication, it is therefore necessary to concentrate on how emails are formulated and created. It is in this context that we expect delivering an appropriate feedback to senders will enhance the quality of email communication. The fundamental idea of the tw o approaches consists in improving the composition of email messages directly at source. For this purpose email senders receive feedback about the quality of their sent emails, enabling them to reflect and improve their emails. "Mail-Check" (see section 4.1) is an approach for automatically evaluating objectively evaluable quality criteria. The email client has to analyse the email and decide if the defined quality criteria are being kept. Upon a fault or shortcoming being identified, the email sender receives a direct, problem-related feedback. The approach "Quality by Assessment and Interaction (Quasi)" (see section 4.2) is a pr ocedure for the subjective, semi-automated evaluation of emails. In this approach the recipients evaluate the emails and these evaluation results are aggregated for a specific period. The aggregated results are then sent back anonymously to the email senders for reflection. Mail-Check supports the active ideational realization of objectively evaluable quality criteria for email communication. In Quasi delivers an overview of the subjectively evaluated quality of the sent emails to the senders. The aggregated feedback statements pursue the goal of pr ovoking an improvement in email quality and the communicative behaviour of the senders when composing emails. When Quasi is applied, email recipients evaluate their received emails. For this purpose, the possible evaluation criteria are offered to the recipients for each received email through an additional wi ndow. This is, however, not obligatory. The evaluation results of all users are collected and sent back to the email senders. The evaluators remain anonymous and their specific evaluation is not disclosed. In addition, each sender has exclusive insight into the evaluations for his or her written emails. The evaluation statistics generated by feedback do not directly affect the adherence to any communication rules. Rather, they implicitly trigger reflection on one X  X  own email communication behaviour. For example, we expect that a frequent evaluation of the attachments sent with emails as "oversized" will cause a more careful practice in the future. Likewise, the evaluation "the text of the email is too long" can induce email authors to condense their emails. In addition, the email ev aluation of "uninteresting" can lead to a reduction of recipients. Thus, we expect a more precise and considered assignment of the sent emails, more in line with the individual responsibilities, intere sts, roles and competencies of the recipients. This may ultimatel y lead to a recipient-oriented email communication of high quality.
 Quasi aims at the self-regula tion of the email communication behaviour of the email authors. Quasi is neither a control mechanism, nor does it aim to provide a solution to individual detail problems. Instead, this a pproach functions as a social regulation, as is usually practiced in face-to-face communications. The quality of emails represents a critical problem in work groups and organizations. Initially, we identified and classified existing quality problems concerning email communication. During our investigations into these qua lity problems we introduced two approaches, both of which provide problem-specific feedback to email senders in order to improve their emails and their email communication behaviour. Preliminar y results suggested that the application of these two approaches might have the potential to improve the overall quality of email communication. A case study will be conducted as further work and will involve a group of [mg1] employees in order to compare and validate the two introduced approaches. The objective of the case study is to examine how the two approaches actually contribute to improving the quality of email communication behaviour in a chosen organizational unit. In addition, the case study will identify if the approaches are appropriate for practical application. We will also investigate in more detail which measure affects which specific email quality criteria. By administering user questionnaires we intend to obtain further information about the practicability of the two approaches as well as possibl e extensions and/or meaningful modifications.
