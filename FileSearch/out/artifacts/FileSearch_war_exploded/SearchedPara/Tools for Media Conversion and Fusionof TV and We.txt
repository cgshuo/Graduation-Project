 We are developing technologies for converting and integrating TV and web con-tent. Conventionally, web pages are browsed on a personal computer (PC) (active browsing) while TV programs are watched on TV (passive watching). However, if TV program and web content is converted and integrated, it can be viewed in different ways depending on one X  X  mood, age, or situation. For instance, when web content is converted into a TV program, you can obtain information in the same way as you do from TV. With our systems, you do not have to operate a PC to get web content, and you can get web content while you are working on other tasks such as cooking. Conversely, when TV programs are converted into web pages, you can quickly browse the content of each program just like you look through web pages. You can also find specific scenes in program easily without fast-forwarding or rewinding a video. This leads to a new viewing style where the content from TV programs and web pages is blended together. In this way, we are aiming to establish technologies for converting and integrating TV and web content, enabling users to  X  X atch X  web pages as TV programs and  X  X rowse X  TV programs in the form of web pages. Tools for such conversion and integration are described in the following two sections.
 We developed two types of tools for converting web content into TV-program-like content. One system is based on the talkshow metaphor and the other on the picture-book metaphor. The characteristics of our systems are:  X  Passive manner interface  X  Transforming into easy content tion, paraphrase, choreography composition.
 Web2Talkshow Web2Talkshow transforms declarative-based web content into humorous dialog-based TV-program-like content that is presented through cartoon animation and synthesized speech[1]. A typical Web2Talkshow display is shown in Fig. 1. Web2Talkshow lets users get desired web content easily, pleasantly, and in a user-friendly way while they continue work on other tasks, so it will be much like watching TV.
 Interactive e-Hon: Translating Web contents into a storybook world Interactive e-Hon (Fig.2)[2] is a word translation medium using animation and dialog explanation to help children understand contents on the Web, e.g., news, episodes, and novels. In the natural language processing, each subject or object is transformed into a character, and each predicate is transformed into the behavior of a character. An animation plays in synchronization with dialog output from a voice synthesizer. We developed  X  WA-TV  X ( W ebification[3] for A ugmenting TV )asatoolfor converting and integrating TV content to web content. It is a prototype system of a next-generation storage TV with video augmented by  X  X ebification X . The characteristics of our systems are:  X  Active manner interface, improvement of scene search efficiency  X  Augmentation of TV content extraction[3], complementary information retrieval[4], zooming crossmedia[3].
Fig. 3 shows an example screen of WA-TV. Groups of caption texts and videos segmented at different levels of details, such as in topics, subtopics, and sentences, are displayed vertically in the form of a storyboard. Hyperlinks to the search results for complementary information are integrated below the caption texts. If necessary, users can access to more detailed or expanded inforamation than provided by the original program.
 Zooming operation smoothly changes the size of thumbnails as well as switches to another storyboard of different level of detail. As a result, users can seamlessly move back and forth among the storyboard screens of different levels of details and the normal playback screen, and thus, can search specific scenes efficiently. This paper described several tools for media conversion and fusion of TV and web content. These tools enable new viewing styles, such as  X  X atching X  web pages as TV programs and  X  X rowsing X  TV programs in the form of web pages. These tools are expected to be applied for push services and streaming services for web content and for interactive services and data broadcasting for TV programs (Fig. 5). They are also expected to become fundamental technologies to establish the Content Convergence Environment (CCE), where in the future users will be able to view web and TV content as if they were blended together (Fig. 5).
