 SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 78 In database marketing, data mining has been u sed extensively to find the op timal customer targets s o as to maximize return on investment. In p articular, using marketing campaign d ata, mod els are typically develop ed to identify characteristics of customers who are most li kely to respond . While these mod els are helpful in identifying the likely respond ers, they may be targeting customers who h ave decided to take the desirable ac tion o r no t regardless of whether they rece ive the ca mpaign con tact (e.g. mail, call) . Based on many y ears of bu siness experience, we identify the a pp rop riate bu siness ob jective a nd its associated mathematical ob jective fun ction . We po int ou t that the c urrent app roach is no t directly designed to solve the a pp rop riate bu siness ob jective. We then propo se a new methodo logy to identify the c ustomers who se decision s will be po sitively influenced b y campaigns. The propo sed methodo logy is easy to implement and can b e used in con jun ction with most comm on ly used sup ervised learning algorithms. An ex ample using simulated d ata is used to illustrate the propo sed methodo logy. This paper may provide the database marketing indu stry with a simple bu t significant methodo logical improvement and op en a new area for further r esearch and develop ment. Database marketing, data mining, kno wledge discovery, predictive mod eling, respon se mod eling, customer r elation ship management, customer develop ment, up selling and cross -selling, treatment effect, true lift, interaction effect Amon g the many app lication s of data mining and kno wledge discovery, database marketing is a key area where scientific bu siness data (see e .g. [17 ;19 ;22 ;32 ]). In the past deca de, many indu stries have a dop ted a data warehou sing project t o capture customer profile a nd interaction d ata (e.g. [18 ;9]). This is the critical requ irement for maximizing learnings of customers s o that companies can p rovide the best offers and messages to the right customers throu gh the right c hann els. Maximizing the  X  learning relation ship X  is a key step in customer r elation ship management or on e -to -on e marketing [29 ;30 ]. App lication s of data mining in database marketing often requ ire profession als with multi -disciplinary skills (e.g. [4], p.196 -197 ) and thu s have drawn interests from profession als in many areas.
 In o rder to maximize ca mpaign return on investment, predictive mod eling is often app lied to d etermine the c haracteristics of customers (or prospects) who are likely to respond u sing data from a previou s campaign. Then p rior to laun ching the next similar campaign, the mod el can b e used to identify likely respond ers. This redu ces the nu mber of con tacts (mails, calls, etc.) [2;3;33 ]) . Other app lication s includ e using predictive mod eling to determine the right offer, right message, and right chann el for campaign e.g. [1]). For simplicity, we will focus on targeting the right customers (or prospects) in this paper while determining the right treatment (offer, message, and chann el) may be c on sidered as an extension .
 Comm on types of marketing campaigns where respon se mod eling can b e a pp lied includ e (e.g. [4], chapters 3 -5): (1) Acqu isition  X  which p rospects are most li kely to b ecome (2) Develop ment  X  which customers are most li kely to bu y (3) Retention  X  which customers are most li kely to b e  X  X aved X  by In this paper, we po int ou t that the c urrent methodo logy widely pub lished in the literature a nd comm on ly used in bu siness is no t directly designed to meet the desired bu siness ob jective. We then propo se a new and simple respon se mod eling methodo logy that can b e used with co mm on ly used statistical and d ata mining techn iqu es. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 , we discuss the app rop riate ca mpaign measurement of mod el effectiveness and then p rovide the a pp rop riate bu siness ob jective for r espon se mod eling. Section 3 ou tlines the c urrent respon se mod eling methodo logy. Section 4 first provides the mathematical ob jective fun ction to meet t he a pp rop riate bu siness ob jective a nd then propo ses a new methodo logy to achieve the ob jection fun ction . Section 5 u ses a simulated example to illustrate the propo sed methodo logy. Section 6 provides recomm end ation s for future research, followed b y con clusion s in section 7 . To d erive the a pp rop riate bu siness ob jective for r espon se mod eling, we first discuss the meas urement of mod el SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 79 effectiveness in marketing campaigns. For campaign -specific respon se mod eling, the main pu rpo se is to improve future campaign return on investment. This can b e acc omplished b y identifying the c ustomers (or prospects) who are most li kely to respond where a respon se ca n b e acce pting an o ffer, increasing revenu e or sales, etc.
 Table 1: Campaign measurement of mod el effectiveness Mod el A B A -B Rando m C D C -D Mod el minu s rando m After a mod el is used for a ca mpaign, analysts may measure the effectiveness of the mod el. Table 1 sho ws a typical example. In this table,  X  X od el X  is the group o f customers identified as  X  X ood  X  (e.g. likely resp ond ers) by the mod el. It may be the top d ecile or top 2 o r 3 d eciles predicted b y the mod el.  X  X ando m X  is the group of customers targeted rando mly.  X  X reatment X  is the group that rece ived a treatment (an o ffer) throu gh d irect mail, e -mail, web, or live c hann el.  X  X on trol X  is the group similar to the treatment group comparison pu rpo se (e.g. [27 ]). A, B, C, and D are ob served aggregate values of a ca mpaign. For examples, they may represent the mean nu mbe r of sales generated, the mean n ew revenu e generated, or simply the mean respon se rates, i.e. they can b e con tinuou s or propo rtion s. If A &gt; C (statistically significantly), it customers who are li kely to respond . However, we wou ld like to see what wou ld h ave happ ened if the c ustomers did no t rece ive the treatment and that is the role of the c on trol group . Now let X  X  loo k at t he difference between  X  X reatment X  and significant) bu t A  X  B = 0 (i.e. assumed statistically insignificant), it means that while the mod el is able to p ick the likely respond ers, it do es no t add any  X  X alue X  to the ca mpaign. It is beca use A  X  B = 0, or A=B, implies that the customers in the mod el -treatment cell (where A is) rece ived the same value a s tho se in the mod el -con trol cell (where B is) who d id no t rece ive the treatment . Note that A -B represents the treatment and con trol difference (e.g. with and withou t mail) for tho se identified b y the mod el. Similarly, C -D represents the treatment and con trol difference for the rando m group . To claim that the mod el  X  X orks X  (i.e.  X  X od el X  is better than  X  X ando m X ), we no t on ly requ ire that A -B &gt; 0 bu t also that A -B &gt; C -D. We propo se th at t he a pp rop riate measure of the gain (in respon se rate, revenu e, or sales, etc.) du e to the treatment is (A -B)  X  (C -D). Thu s, we suggest that the qu antitative bu siness ob jective of a mod el, measured b y its effectiveness for campaigns, is to maximize (A -B)  X  (C -D), which is hereafter referred to as the true lift . The c urrent methodo logy typically uses the treatment data to identify characteristics of customers who are likely to respond . In other words, for ind ividu al customer (or pros pect) i  X  W , where W = set of all customers (or prospects), Y variable (e.g. respond o r no t, sales, revenu e, profit), X X ind ividu al charac teristics (e.g. age, income, past t ransaction behavior), f (.) is the fun ction al form of the mod el. For examples, expect ed Y i becomes the prob abilit y that Y I = 1 (i.e. respon se rate), and f (.) is a logistic fun ction o f X i ([16 ]). In fact, equ ation (1) is a general sup ervised learning mod el form as f (.) may be non linear decision trees s uch as CART and CHAID, see [6;28 ]), splines ([36 ;38 ]), compo site fun ction s (e.g. multi -layer perception in neural networks [5;12 ]), other neural network mod els (e.g. [23 ;35 ]), mixture mod els (e.g. [37 ;12 ]), Bayesian mod els (e.g. [13 ;2 0]), or hybrids (e.g. [11 ;14 ;26 ]).
 In d ata mining, as s umm arized in Fig 1, the e ntire data set from a previou s campaign is usually divided into training (or learning) and ho ldou t (or validation ) samples. f (.) is then fitted (or trained) using the training sample. Then the fitted mod el is app lied to the ho ldou t sample for validation pu rpo ses. Examples of validation includ e plotting the ob served average values by mod el -based decile (see e .g. [3;33 ]). Unlike in tradition al statistical mod eling where the ob ject ive is to find the best  X  X verall X  fitness measured by the sum of squ ares of residu als or joint log -likelihood fun ction interested in targeting on ly the  X  X est X  customers or prospects s uch as top 1 -3 d eciles. Other related measures are mention ed in [31 ]. Mathematically, the c urrent methodo logy uses mod el (1) to predict Y i for eac h customer i in a new data set and then select the set of customers S (  X  W) that have the highest predicted Y tre atment, i.e. where i deno tes customer i , sub ject to bud get or other r esou rce con straints. If Y i deno tes customer profitabilit y, this is equ ivalent to maximizing the overall profit. If Y i deno tes respon se rate, this implies maximiz ing the sum of respon se rates. This app roach h as been mention ed in vast amoun t of literature such as [2;3;33 ]. SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 80 measure in campaigns is the differen ce between mod el and rando m incremental (treatment minu s con trol) differences, i.e. (A -B)  X  (C -D) in Table 1, or the true lift .
 Note that the c urrent methodo logy for ob jective (2) is essentially maximizing the difference between the mod el -treatment and ran do m -treatment, i.e. A (with mod el) and C (rando m) und er the treatment column in Table 1. In o rder to achieve the ob jective of of customers S (  X  W) that have the highest i ncremental differenc es between treatment and con trol, i.e. sub ject to bud get or other resou rce c on straints. prospects) who se respon ses will be po sitively influenced b y the treatment . Con sid er a simplified example, in the a utomob ile indu stry, a c ompany selling high -end expensive ca rs uses direct mails to target ind ividu als who are wealthy and currently have a n expensive ca r. However, if their current car is already very old, they may decide t o replace the ca r prior to rece iving a direct mail (some decide to bu y the same ca r the c ompany is s elling and others decide to bu y other cars). On the other hand , if their current car is no t old enou gh, they may no t con sider bu ying a new on e. In either ca se, the treatment respon se rate is no t expected to b e better than the natural respon se rate in the c on trol group . The c hallenge is to target ind ividu als who o wn an expensive ca r of right age so that they will respond to the direct mail (treatment) before m aking characteristics of ind ividu als who se decision s will be po sitively influenced b y the direct mail. To achieve (3), we need to estimate bo th E(Y i |X E(Y i |X i ;con trol) . Note that (3) redu ces to (2) if E(Y acqu isition p rob lems. For example, in the c redit card indu stry, card un less a direct mail i s rece ived (typically with a good o ffer such as low interest rate, low rate of balance transfer, or cash rebate). That means, the respon se rate for the c on trol (no mail) is close to zero. However, in customer d evelop ment campaigns includ ing cross -selling and up selling, customers may more likely take the initiative regardless of whether they rece ive a direct mail. customer X  X  CD (certificate of depo sit), the c ustomer may initiate a transfer to a mon ey market mutual fund to p reserve the relatively high interest i ncome. This is no t surprising g iven the internal competiti on b etween the CD and mutual fund p rodu cts (e.g. [21 ]). Therefore, her decision to transf er mon ey to ano ther produ ct may be made before rece iving a direct mail and thu s, the treatment and con trol group s may no t give a ny different campaign result. Nevertheless, (3) is the a pp rop riate general ob jective for all t ypes of campaigns and is especiall y impo rtant for customer develop ment. We no w use a special case of binary respon se variable to d escribe ou r propo sed methodo logy. If Y i is a binary respon se variable representing whether customer i respond s to a ca mpaign, we con sider the following set of ind epend ent variables: X X the c on trol group . We may mod el the respon se rate using a linear logistic regression [16 ]: i
P parameters measuring the main effects of the ind epend ent variables,  X  deno tes the main treatment effect, and  X  measures add ition al effects of the ind epend ent variables du e to treatment. In reality, some variable redu ction p rocedu re will usually be a pp lied to n arrow do wn the list of X i , T i , and X i *T i the parameters in equ ation (4).
 Then, i
P = That is, the parameter estimates ob taine d in equ ation (4) can b e treatment and con trol. Tho se with h igh po sitive predicted differences will be selected for next campaign targeting.
 While e qu ation (4) may be new in d atabase marketing, a similar practice of mod eling and analysis has been app lied widely in the example, [25 ] con clud es that a new HIV treatment i s more effective than the tradition al t reatment (dd I alon e) for HIV -infected children und er 3 years old bu t no t for older children. In clinical trials, the ob jective is usually to measure the treatmen t effect given the presence of other factors (baseline c haracteristics such as age a t treatment initiation ) and also po ssibly determine whether the treatment effect i s the same ac ross variou s group s (e.g. whether gend er * treatment is a significant interac tion factor SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 81 [34 ]). The latter app ears to b e similar to ou r ob jective in d atabase marketing. However, in clinical trials, the ob jective is to identify risk factors that may affect treatment -respon se relation ship while level, who will be more po sitively influenced b y the treatment effect. Ano ther major difference is that the nu mber of ind epend ent variables and the nu mber of ob servation s are no rmally much smaller in clinical trial stud ies. For mod el estimation , we use bo th the treatment and con trol group s. Fig 2 ind icates that bo th the training and ho ldou t data sets includ e the treatment and con trol group s as oppo sed to the c urrent methodo logy in Fig 1 where on ly the treatment group is used. More generally, we propo se the following procedu re for estimating E(Y i |X i ;treatment) and E(Y i |X i ;con trol) where Y con tinuou s or binary; and the mod el fun ction al form can b e linear, linear logistic, or non linear: 1. Includ e data, {Y i ,X i } from bo th the treatment and con trol 2. Assign a du mm y variable T i to 1 for the treatment group and 3. Divide the data set into training and ho ld -ou t samples; 4. Further div ide the training sample into two sub -samples by 5. Choo se a variable selection method (or called feature 6. Take the un ion o f the two redu ced sets of ind epend ent 7.

Use stepwise procedu re (or similar mod el selection After the best mod el i s s elected, we propo se the following procedu re for validation using the ho ldou t sample: 1.

The e xpected true lift can b e measured b y ho w much the top We will ill ustrative the a bo ve procedu res in Section 5 .
 The general form of (4) and (5) is s imply as follows: For example, if Y i is a c on tinuou s variable representing revenu e, we may use a multi -layer perceptron n eural network with a single hidd en layer: SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 82 equ ation s (6) and (7), a simple mod ification will be requ ired. See the App end i x for the ca se when Na X ve Bayes is used. We no w illustrate the methodo logy with a simulation stud y. We a ssume the following logistic mod els for treatment and con trol respon se rates: = = where the ind epend ent variables are generated as follows: ag e  X  N(45 ,13 2 ), trad e  X  Bin(n=10 ,p=0.15 ), wealth  X  N(800 +3ag e,150 2 ), asset  X  N(400 +0.3wealth,150 2 ), and ho me v alue  X  N(0.7wealth,70 2 ).
 To reflect reality, these variables are c reat ed to b e c orrelated with eac h o ther. Other than trad e , they can b e jointly expressed in the following multivariate no rmal form ( wealth, asset, and ho me value are a ll i n $000 ):  X   X   X   X   X   X   X  Note that while ho me v alue is av ailable for mod eling, it do es no t app ear in the true mod els in (8) and (9). Equ ation s (8) and (9) ind icate that bo th treatment and con trol respon se rates are a ffected coefficients of age a nd asset in (9) are higher than tho se in (8) ind icate that the differential effects between treatment and con trol app ear in age a nd asset. In p articular, older peop le a nd p eop le with h igher assets tend to respond to the treatment more likely than p eop le in the c on t rol group .
 Using the a bo ve true mod els, we rando mly generated 100 ,000 ob servation s with 80 ,000 from the treatment group and 20 ,000 from the c on trol group . We a pp ly the c urrent methodo logy in this s ection . First, we rando ml y divide the set of 100 ,000 simulated ob servation s into training and ho ldou t samples with 50 ,000 eac h. Using the c urrent methodo logy, we on ly focus on the treatment data. Then, we attempt t o n arrow do wn the set of ind epend ent variables by generating a simp le c orrelation matrix between the respon se rate and all five ind epend ent variables using the treatment data. Due to the high correlation (empirical coefficient&gt;0.85 ) between wealth and ho me v alue and the fact that wealth has a higher correlation with the r espon se, we drop the ho me v alue variable.
 Next, we run a stepwise linear logistic regression o f the respon se rate on ag e, trad e, wealth , and asset in SAS, resulting in the following mod el (sub script i is omitted for con venience): = Then we use the a bo ve e stimated mod el (10 ) to rank and d ecile the ho ldou t sample. Fig 3 sho ws the performance in bo th the treatment and con trol group s. The ho rizon tal axis is the decile (predicted) based on the a bo ve e stimated mod el and the vertical axis sho ws the ob served respon se rate by decile. The mod el do es perform  X  X ell X  in the sense of the declining respon se rate by decile. In p articular, the top d ecile generates a treatment respon se rate of 0.93 compared to the rando m treatment respon se rate of 0.6 2. Note that bo th treatment and con trol rates decline by decile. To evaluate the true lift , we sub tract t he c on trol rate from the treatment rate in eac h d ecile a s s ho wn in Fig 4. In Fig 4, in SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 83 add ition to the ob served d ifference between treatment and con tro l rates, we c ompu te the  X  X ctual X  lift that is s imply the respon se rate difference between the ac tual treatment and con trol rates in (8) and (9). The ac tual li ft is on ly available throu gh simulation s bu t will no t be a vailable in p ractice.
 Fig 4 sho ws that , first, the ac tual and ob served h ave similar patterns and , second , bo th ind icate that t he treatment minu s con trol li ft do es no t decline by decile. In fact, the fou rth and fifth deciles have the highest li ft. To app ly the propo sed methodo logy, we follow the e stimation procedu re ou tlined in Section 4 .4. In the training sample, we no w includ e bo th the treatment and con trol data for mod eling. Following the e stimation steps 1 -4, we have T i =1 for the treatment group and T i =0 for the c on trol group .
 Following the e stimation steps 5 and 6 in section 4 .4, we perform variable selection b y investigating the c orrelation matrix of the respon se rate a nd all five ind epend ent variables by T du e to the high correlation s (em pirical coefficients&gt;0.85 ) between wealth and ho me v alue in bo th the treatment and con trol group s and the fact that wealth has a higher correlation with the respon se rate, we drop the ho me v alue variable in bo th the treatment and con trol group s.
 We then ru n a stepwise linear logistic regression u sing the mod el form in equ ation (4) in SAS, resulting in the following estimated mod el (sub script i is omitted for con venience): = (11 ) can b e rewritten as: = = Note that the e stimated mod el in (12 ) and (13 ) is very close to the actual mod el in (8) and (9) except that the e stimated mod el is no t able to capture the treatment and con trol differential effect of asset.
 Next, in the ho ldou t sample, we foll ow the validation steps 1 -3 to estimate the treatment and con trol respon se rates using (12 ) -(13 ) and then take the difference to estimate the lift for eac h ind ividu al. We then rank and d ecile the ho ldou t sample with the e stimated treatment minu s con trol li ft.
 Fig 5 sho ws the ob served respon se rate by decile for treatment and con trol, respectively. This do es no t sho w any declining pattern. However, following the validation steps 4 -6, Fig 6 sho ws that t he ob served d ifference by decile has a declining pattern. Similarly for the  X  X ctual X  difference which is again the respon se rate difference between the ac tual treatment and con trol rates in the a verage (rando m) lift of 0.29 .

X  Comparing Fig 6 to Fig 4, we ca n recognize the significant improvement using the propo sed methodo logy, which aims at solving the a pp rop riate bu siness prob lem by maximizing the expected true lift .

Specifically, the c urrent methodo logy may find the c ustomers (or prospects ) who will t ake the desirable ac tion regardless of the treatment. The propo sed methodo logy, ho wever, identifies the customers (or prospects) such that t he incremental difference between treatment and con trol respon ses is maximized. In o ther words, we a im a t find ing the c haracteristics of customers (or prospects) who se ca mpaign respon se decision s can b e po sitively influenced b y the treatment. This is particularly impo rtant for customer develop ment campaigns (up selling and cross -selling). The propo sed methodo logy is s imple a nd can b e readily app lied in con jun ction with most comm on ly used linear or non linear mod eling techn iqu es for sup ervised learning such as linear regression , logistic regression , decision tree, spline regression , and n eural network.

Many thanks to Johnn y Shi and Jane Zheng for brainstorming ideas and implementing the propo sed methodo logy, Kathleen Kane for po inting ou t that the c urrent methodo logy may no t solve the right bu siness prob lem, and Florence H Y on g for her valuable comm ents on a draft of this article. Na X ve Bayes is a relatively simple data mining techn iqu e. However, by d efinition , it do es no t have a c losed fun ction al form. As a result, equ ation (6) canno t be e xplicitly written and thu s equ ation (7) canno t be derived. Assume that Y i is a binary respon se variable representing whether customer i respond s to a ca mpaign, we c on sider the following set of p ind epend ent variables: X i = (X i1 ,..., X ip Add ition ally, P(.) deno tes a prob abilit y or prob abilit y distribu tion prob abilit y distribu tion .
