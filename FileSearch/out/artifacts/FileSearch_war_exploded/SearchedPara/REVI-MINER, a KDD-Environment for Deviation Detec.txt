  X  Different warranty and goodwill policies for each of the So far DaimlerChrysler has deployed a single standard auditing shortcomings:  X  The report generated by the system is a complicated the above shortcomings, it should also include the following features:  X  Periodic auditing of repair shops within shortened time  X  Fast detection of anomalies in the warranty cost statements,  X  Avoidance of false alarms by indicating fraudulent activities  X  Visualization of the results. a KDD-based approach in an elementary plausibility study, together with the users coneerned. We also investigated whether Machine Learning technology would help us to improve data quality in the data preprocessing phase. The results of the approach. the QUIS (QUality Information System) database, which can be query I: general vehicle data  X  VIN (vehicle ID number)  X  date of production  X  engine type  X  sales continent  X  sales country of former Daimler-Benz AG. In order to achieve a high speed collect and check the warranty and goodwill claims of their respective repair area and transfer them to VEGA where the to a minimum. This can cause serious data quality problems within QUIS. As QUIS delivers the raw data for systems like 
REVI-MINER or WAPS (WArranty Prediction System), we decided to develop and implement a data cleaning functionality for this central database. 
To check the quality of data, we have developed three initial these three approaches resulted from both business user requirements and system constraints (Oracle/Unix).  X  Exploratory approach: Stored (historic) data is described prototype and GritBot) are to be aggregated and collected over time in database tables. From these values, corresponding data quality figures will be derived and monitored. As all three them during the following months. The concept of REVI-MINER is based upon the CRISP-DM I methodology and covers the main steps  X  Business understanding  X  Data understanding  X  Data preparation  X  Modeling  X  Evaluation , Deployment. I CRISP-DM: CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (see http://www.crisp-dm.org) This can be a 2-digit, 5-digit or 7-digit number. As we have about five thousand different damage codes on the 5-digit deviation analysis criteria for all of them. REVI-MINER can identify the most expensive and most frequent damage codes thus creating a list of top damage codes, for which the analysis will be executed. The user just has to determine the number of codes for the top list. was needed). conditioner unit, engine (number of repairs with deployment of aggregate parts). shop site)

Graphical presentation of these figures shows conspicuous differences between the facilities.

Its functionality a user interface with easily manageable menus based on VISUAL BASIC forms. REVI-MINER provides the means for a fast, efficient, and meaningful analysis of the warranty and goodwill department GSP/SMW early warning of possibly fraudulent activities. REVI-MINER allows to the controllers flexible and detailed plenty of time that can be used for the on-site audit. the department GSP/SMW within the Direction Global Service and trustful cooperation during the development of REVI-MINER.
