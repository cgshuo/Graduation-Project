 Research in visualization of ten revolves around visualizing information. However, visualizati on is a process that extends over time from initial exploration to hypothesis confirmation, and even to result presentation. It is rare that the final phases of visualization are solely about in formation. In this paper we present a more biased kind of visualization, in which there is a message or set of assumptions be hind the presentation that is of interest to both the presenter and the viewer, and emphasizes points that the presenter wants to convey to the viewer. This kind of persuasive visualization --presenting data in a way that emphasizes a point or message --is not only common in visualization, but also often exp ected by the viewer. Persuasive visualization is implicit in the deliberate emphasis on interestingness and also in the deliberate use of graphical elements that are processed preattentively by the human visual system, which automatically gr oups these elements and guiding attention so that they  X stand out X . We discuss how these ideas have been implemented in the Morpherspective system for automated generation of information graphics.

Automated generation of visuali zations, preattentive processing, chart junk, persuasion, empha sis, information agendas. Visualization is an essential part of data mining. It permits assimilation of complex informa tion and elicitation of patterns and knowledge from data. It reveal s what textual representations could not hope to reveal by exploiting the high bandwidth of the human visual system in ways that permit it to absorb information both rapidly and memorably. Ho wever, visualization in data mining is a process that extends over multiple phases, from an initial exploratory phase to later phases that focus on presentation of data mining results. Visualization is usually thought of as an exploratory process. Perhaps because exploring the volume and complexity of the information presents many options , much research has focused on technical aspects rather than on other issues related to human factors. For example, the well-known work of Tufte [27, 28, 29] has inspired many advances in visualization, emphasizing the use of principles that maximize information or data content. To the extent that bias in explorati on can adversely impact mining, staying focused on information and objectivity is important. This paper considers persuasive visualization , a later phase of visualization that is less focused on objectivity in principle and more concerned with the human angle. In persuasive visualization there is a hypothesized model and the goal is to present some confirmation. Thus, this persuasive phase concerns presentation of data in a way that emphasizes some point or message. From this more humanistic perspective, visualization is a means of communication , and of conveying messages present in the data, rather than just a means for presenting information. In both the exploratory and later phases, a primary goal of visualization is to highlight patte rns so that they stand out. A desired end result, in other words, is an information graphic that communicates something. Even in exploratory data analysis and confirmatory data visualizati on, where the consumers and the producers are the same, people look for certain patterns in the data, and their choice of graphic fo rmat aids in those discoveries. Eventually they do present the re sults to other people, and these presentations will invariably be persuasive  X  they will have a message or point. The more pe rsuasive the message, the more effective the presentation. Although this view may seem new, it is a practical view of visualization. Kosslyn [14] indi cated that people want to be convinced of some point, and expect one per graph. A good example of a message in visua lization would be the famous Minard graphic depicting Na poleon X s disastrous Russian campaign of 1812 shown in Figure 1. Tufte, who referred to it as  X the best graphic ever produced X  [27], believed it to be making an anti-war statement; and it depicts the annihilation or desertion of about a half million soldiers. It was drawn by the 90-year old Minard (who had been 32 during the Russian campaign) in September 1870, when the Prussian army was advancing toward Paris, ultimately causing Minard to flee Paris for Bordeaux where he died of fever the following m onth [19]. Although it is a famous example of information visualization, it is also clearly an example of a message, and one that would have been powerful for Minard X s audience. Figure 1. Minard's graphic sh owing the dwindling size of As Playfair put it, regarding the graphs he made in The Commercial and Political Atlas (considered to be one of the pioneering works in information graphics),  X On inspecting any one of these Charts attentively, a sufficiently distinct impression will be made, to remain unimpaired for a considerable time, and the idea which does remain will be simple and complete, at once including the duration and the amount. Men of great rank, or active business, can only pay atten tion to general outlines; nor is attention to particulars of use, any further than as they give a general information: And it is hope d, that with the assistance of these Charts, such information w ill be got, without the fatigue and trouble of studying the particulars of which it is composed. X  Given that some believe that the data speaks for itself, a natural question at this point would be why anyone would want or need to include preferences or emphases in visualizations. Indeed, without the data there is not much point in making information graphics, and the presence of the data does communicate something. However, as in a ll forms of communication it is not just the content that is important; presentation also plays a big part. As Kosslyn [14] wrote,  X the mind judges a book by its cover. X  Since it is a means of communication, we can draw an analogy between visualization and text, in that both convey messages, and are composed of basic elements, which are combined into structured repres entations. Following this analogy, a graphic can be thought of as being akin to a paper; and as a good paper would draw the readers into its flow of logic and convince them of the thesis the au thor(s) are trying to prove, so a good visualization should direct the viewers X  attention to the graphical elements that would pe rsuade them to see the graph maker X s point. The choice of format for a visualization greatly influences what it conveys. For example, scatter pl ots are generally used to show correlations and patterns, while bar charts are employed for comparison. Color and shape also play an important part in the reception of the message, as shown by the common use of multicolored 3-dimensional pie charts where simple 2-column tables would more than suffice. Choice of format does not entail any falsification of data  X  as in writing a paper, arguing one X s case and making a point is not equiva lent to lying. And just as papers are written with certain sets of readers in mind, the intended audience is an important aspect of any visualization. Many emphasis mechanisms are used in visualization to draw attention to points of interest. These include choice of colors, highlighting, visual grouping, and di stortion (like fish-eye views). These mechanisms are suppor ted in a direct way by preattentive processing , a feature extraction process performed in the human vision system prior to conscious a ttention. The features that can be processed preattentively have been organized into groups based on form, color, motion, and spatial position [30]: A consequence (or perhaps a definition) of preattentive processing is the increased speed with which information can be perceived  X  because it  X stands out X  and can be seen  X at a glance X . This is clearly essential to visualizati on, and indeed some have argued that  X an understanding of what is processed preattentively is probably the most important cont ribution that vision science can make to data visualization X  [30]. An example relying on preattentiv e processing is shown in figure 2 [3], presenting two sequences are aligned based on their values. The use of bold font emphasizes the aligned segments, with arrows showing the alignment as well. Unaligned segments are distorted by stretching so that the matching segments may be visually aligned. In the persuasive phase of visua lization, emphasis is essential. Thus research on this kind of vi sualization can be based both on greater appreciation of human concerns, including for example the importance of having an inte resting message or point, and on an understanding of emphasis in visualization such as in preattentive processing. As expl ained below both of these factors are relevant in characterizing  X interestingness X , which is still an important open problem in data mining. Greater appreciation of persuasi veness suggests rules for better and more persuasive visualization. These can in turn be adapted for adjusting automated generation of visualizations. One of our main goals was to show how this adaptation can be achieved and implemented in an automated system  X  the Morpherspective system [3], described toward the end of the paper. The idea of persuasion has been heavily studied in fields like psychology [4] and in marketing (an example among many can be found in [7]; but we will not go into this further). Books like How to Lie with Statistics [10], How to Lie with Charts [11] point out various ways to misrepresent in formation. This work is not generally discussed in the context of visualization. Indeed, books on the creation of effective information graphics instead repeat Tufte X s points about maximizing da ta ink [27, 28] and do their utmost to caution against  X mislead ing X  information graphics. Of course, in our view any powerful tool can be abused, and we should not ignore legitimate uses of persuasion to provide better communication. Of particular relevance to the t opic of persuasiveness is the field of automated generation of data graphics, since its purpose is to more or less create the data graphics that the user wants to see without the user actually having to making these graphs. In essence the intent is that the automated system can eventually do what a good human data graphic designer is capable of. While current research has not yet reached that point, much progress has been made. Works on automated data genera tion include Mackinlay X s APT ( X A Presentation Tool X ) [15, 16], one of the first projects done in this field. It generates simple 1-D and 2-D graphs, such as bar charts, scatter plots, and networ k diagrams, based on the type of the data: quantitative, ordinal, or nominal. It also has the ability to compose new graphs from two or more graphs, by either combining them or aligning the axes. The APT system X s primary selection criterion for the graphic elements are the expressiveness of these elements in presenting the aforementioned types of data, with considerations for limitati ons of the presentation media (color, etc.). Casner X s system, BO Z [2], extends APT, but is task-oriented instead of data-type-oriented. It has a logical task description language that is used to identify the user X s intent, such as search, comparison, etc. S AGE [20, 21, 22, 23] is another extension of APT that generate s both graphs and captions. It supports a finer categorization of data for visualization purposes, as well as user intentions in creating the graphics. SAGE separates graphical formats into the following types: chart, network (connected graph), map, table, grid, label, and outline. PostGraphe [5, 6] is another syst em that automatically generates both the graph and its explanatory captions. The graphical output it produces also varies depending on user intentions  X  a format is chosen from a fixed set based on considerations for intentions, data types, and expressi veness. However, it is not an extension of APT. Also, whereas SAGE explains the graphical format , PostGraphe explains the content , thereby actually stating the underlying message with text. IMPROVISE [32, 33] is a system which automatically creates visual discourses (connected disp lays). IMPROVISE defines an extensive classification of data characterization, so that it has more an appearance of a general visual programming language. Gadget/IV [8] is a system that semi-automatically designs graphics. It uses a fixed hierar chy of visualization techniques and a set of rules (which deals both with the data type and user goals) to find a set of graphical formats which can suit the user X s needs, then presents those formats for the user to choose from. The intent of the graphics produced by these systems is information display, which is mo re related to the expressiveness of the formats. They do not really take into account (except for PostGraphe, which is limited by its set of formats) what the presenter really wants to convey. These systems do not permit specification of a more specific intent, like making a point or conveying a message. Of course, it is not always the case that a strong message is attached to a data graphic; and it is certainly not the intent of these research proj ects to persuade viewers with the generated graphics. This paper approaches visualization not just as a process for objective exploration of informati on, but also as a process for communication of patterns in the information. If the goal of visualization is to make pattern s stand out, and do this in a way that people find interesting, empha sis becomes a basic part of the process. When the goal is furt hermore to communicate a point or message about the data, we are led to persuasive visualization and the techniques proposed in this paper. There are many ways to convey a message in visualization. This paper focuses on the use of emphasi s, through highlighting, color, and other preattentively processed graphic elements for directing the viewer X s attention. The fo llowing sections will discuss some of the approaches that can be used in visualization. A benefit of this approach is that they can be reduced to a kind of science, and implemented in automated systems for visualization. The Morpherspective system presented in the final section gives an example of how these principles for making better and more persuasive visualizations can be formalized and automated. Summarizing, specific contributions of this work include (1) identifying the role of persua sion (and communicating a message) in visualization, (2) clarifyi ng how various emphasis techniques can be used to catch viewer atte ntion and provide essential forms of persuasion, and (3) implemen ting these emphasis techniques in Morpherspective, a system for au tomated generation of persuasive visualization. Not all views of data are equal. As mentioned previously, the effectiveness in communication is not governed solely by the maximization of data content, a principle championed by Tufte [27, 28, 29] and widely accepted by researchers. While this principle is useful in many contex ts, it is not always sufficient. Principles like forgoing non-information graphics, or "chartjunk" as termed by Tufte, risk valuing aesthetics more highly than they value capabilities of the human visual system. An example is the visualization of complex da ta, which cannot be understood through casual perusal. Just pres enting such data in a compressed format does not persuade people to study it in the depth required to absorb the information. As Nobel laureate Herbert Simon [25] wrote,  X  X in an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What info rmation consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attenti on of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a pove rty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources th at might consume it. X  Graphics need to reflect the audience X s capacity and willingness to understand. Accommodating the interests of the viewers is essentially making the visuali zation interesting, which is necessary to catch the viewer X s attention. However, it is well known that  X interestingness X  has an elusive definition. Recently in the data mining area a number of researchers have attempted to equate high information content with interestingness. Problems with this approach include that it does not account for information overload or the interests of the viewer. As Simon noted [26], the real problem is not information s carcity but attention scarcity. Alternative definitions such as th at of Silberschatz and Tuzhilin [24] measures interestingness by  X actionability X  (ability of information to be acted upon) and unexpectedness (also used in [18]), while Kleinberg et al. [13] defines interestingness of data as Hilderman and Hamilton [9] use comp lete statistical measures to get an objective view of interes tingness. Applying these notions of interestingness to visualizati on gives about the same result as Tufte X s visualization principle, and still leaves the issue of interestingness hanging, because those approaches are still information-oriented, which is only a part (albeit major) of what good visualization should be. Anot her problem of applying these concepts to visualizations woul d be the narrowness and computer-orientation of those definitions of interesting, as they are rather rigid definitions not made with graphics in mind, and mostly exclude what would make people look at the data in the first place. In other words, this is not what generates interest in the audience. The major obstacle to defining, a nd hence using, interestingness is probably the subjectivity of interestingness. There are many things that may make visualiza tions interesting for different people, such as impressive graphi cs, fancy views, etc. This was certainly a problem with the old st atic mediums such as paper. However, taking from the example from the billboards lining the streets and other forms advertisement that are to catch people X s attention, it is obvious that people, or at least certain groups of people, tend to find decorations and images interesting. So, instead of being a distraction, these decorations and images can serve to attract people X s attention to the information graphics, not to mention that they can also provide background information so that people from different backgrounds can sort of get a feel for the subject matter. Hence, a good way to cater to the audience X s interest is to incorporate the use of images as icons and backgrounds. However, as intere stingness is subjective and some users may want different kinds of customizations to the information graphics they are to view (and some might not want any at all if they just want the data), personalization of customization may be important. Personalization is hardly a new idea, but has a greater role to play in visualization. This is a fine answer to the question that Tufte asked (in jest) on the problem of misconception and miscommunication when using them :  X A different graphic for each perceiver in each context? X  With computers and advances in technology, such customizations can be used to enhance the interestingness and understandability of automatically generated visualizations. To illustrate the use of interestingness, weather diagrams are shown in figure 3 and figure 4 [3]. 
Figure 4. An obvious weather chart, no keys needed (best Figure 3 is part of a weather diagram redrawn from Tufte X s Envisioning Information [28]. Figure 4 shows the same diagram redrawn with a bit of enhancem ent using little image icons taken and modified from MSNBC X s website ( http://www.msnbc.com ). Only the weather pertaining to pa rt of January and February is Although the first diagram can be reduced without losing readability, only one look is needed to realize that the second diagram is about weather, and it does not need a key to be understandable. Moreover, the pres ence of color draws attention. Color preference is yet another technique to get viewers interested. People may prefer colored graphs to black and white ones, and certain colors tend to get more attention, as traffic signs indicate  X  stop signs are red for a very good reason. Colors are also associated with certain things that can draw the interest of certain types of audience; for example, green grids on black tend to give the feeling of sci-fi or high tech. As with all enhancements, the use of color may mislead some; but abuse is possible with the use of most an y graphical elements and should not prohibit its use. It is often the case that not only do visualization creators want viewers to look at the graphics but also to specifically notice certain parts thereof, such as the parts that supports certain conclusions. Emphasis techniques on the internal visual properties of a graph can be used to clarify or emphasize the message to be communicated through the information graphic. As mentioned earlier, preattentive processing can be used as a basis for emphasis, and gaining attention, by making symbols more likely to  X be visually identified, even after very brief exposure X , so that  X certain simple shapes and colors  X pop out X  from their surroundings X  [30]. For effective communication, cer tain data points should be emphasized, if they fit the criteria for importance in the eyes of the maker of the presentation, whether the significance is in the urgency of a medical procedure or a big sale. In fact, all mapmakers  X highlight critical in formation X  and  X suppress detail of lower priority. X  [17] While some may argue that finding data to fit a certain criteria is nothing more than filtering, in some cases it is better not to take the data out of the context  X  sometimes it is helpful to see how the emphasized data relates to the other data, so as not to lose the big picture. Also of note: not only are all data not equal, they cannot all be partitioned into two categories: important and unimportant. Hence varying degrees of high lighting may be desirable. Multilevel highlighting, or visual filtering, such as assigning differing levels of brightness to da ta that fit different categories, can show the relative importance of the data. An example can be found in picking travel routes. The  X best X  route (possibly determined by a computer program according to someone X s needs, or by the user X s interaction) can be highlighted the brightest, with the alternative routes highlighted in varying degrees consistent with their de sirability. As an illustration, figure 5 [3] displays two charts showing the routes a student can take to UCLA (all times approximate due to traffic, weather, etc.) from approximately 30 miles away, in the time bracket from 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM, which is th e latest permissible time of arrival. The driving times and bus schedules for two buses are indicated; the student may choose to drive all the way and find parking, or she may drive to a mall, park there, take the bus, and so avoid parking hassles at UCLA. The upper chart in figure 5 just shows the routes under consideration, while the lower chart shows a highlighted preferred route, as well as an alternative with less highlighting. Another method of emphasis currently unavailable in automatically generated informati on graphics is the enclosure of interested data points in a circ le or polygon (for two-dimensional graphs; a box, a sphere, etc., for three-dimensional ones), which may also be highlighted. If certain properties of the data are to be emphasized, such as periodicity, a circular transform (such as changing to a polar graph or using a spiral axis) may be used to highlight this. Well-known emphasi s techniques include fish-eye focus and many other data space distortions as well. An additional example of emphasis can be illustrated with the partially exploded pie. Consider the pies in figure 6, which shows the major categories of federal income and outlays for the fiscal year 2002. The original diagrams , in which all pie slices are white and unexploded, can be found on p.76 of the 2003 1040 Forms and Instructions . Here, through the use of exploded pie pieces (which are also colored more prominently to draw more attention), the income percen tage obtained from borrowing and the spending percentage on paying debts are emphasized. This example also serves as a reminde r of how persuasive techniques can be used to deceive; not only are pie charts not the best choice for relative comparisons, but the tilted perspective and volume of 3-D pie charts distorts the sizes and make the  X nearer X  side appear bigger and more prominent (t he exploded pieces would look smaller if they were at the opposite side). Nevertheless, 3-D pie charts are very popular because many people simply like them, and they draw the viewers X  attenti on more than simple data tables. 
Figure 6. Partially exploded 3-D pie charts emphasizing the amount the federal government is borrowing to pay off debt interests in 2002 ( 2003 1040 Forms and Instructions , IRS) Sometimes the emphasis is not on certain data points but on the relationships of data or a certain view of the data. A good way to achieve this is through distorti on techniques, which have long been used on information gra phics. For reference, Keim X s presentation [12] has many vi sualization techniques including distortions. In addition, Wilkinson [31] has a good chapter on some distortion transformati ons and their mathematical formalization. The purpose for distortion techniques found in literature is generally to focus on a certain part of the display. As this kind of usage (such as fish lens and other magnification methods) has been detailed abundantly in computer science literature, and it consists mostly of magnification and simple highlighting, we will not discuss it here. Instead, we will focus on ways to transform the view to support the messages the information graphic creator wants to convey. Distortions that offer different perspectives on the data included simple ones such as using a spiral axis to better emphasize the periodic nature of cyclical data, or employing logarithmic scales to better illustrate relationshi ps on graphs involving large magnitudes, such as the half-life of radioactive elements. More complex transformations on the data space (grid/axes) can encode additional information about the data, such as displaying warped lines to indicate the rate of inflation, when the information graphic shows inflation-adjust ed monetary values. Although some believe that only straight lines give the correct representation, transforming the grid actually is more truthful and informative as it can show how the data is affected by other factors. A good illustration can be found in the example on oil prices from 1972 to 1979 presented in [27]. The oil prices for each year are given in table 1, along with inflation rates. Figure 7 [3] shows two graphs, one with the raw, unmodified data, and one with inflation-adjust ed dollars. While the first chart shows the data without any adjustment, it would generally be considered not quite truthful, while the adjusted data would generally be recognized as bei ng accurate. However, we can do better than just being accurate  X  Figure 8 [3], shows the graph not only with inflation adjustments but also a warped grid reflecting the devaluation of the dollar. As can be seen, the plot in figure 8 shows not only the changes in the real price of the oil but also the nominal price for each year  X  in fact, prices in any year X s dollars. In addition, the effect of inflation is shown in such a way that the user can see how the raw data (nominal prices) are transfor med into real prices. This kind of graph would be very useful if anyone wants to justify raising certain costs due to inflation (a nd also for anyone who wants to refute them if the data supports that view). Adjustments for noise and other fact ors affecting the data can also be shown this way. A good exampl e can be seen in [31] where the air travel price is shown for the country, such that the  X distance X  reflects the cost of travel instead of the physical mileage between places. As the intent of the information graphic is to show that the cost of air travel is not uniform across the country, distorting the map of the U.S. is perfect for displaying that fact. An interesting point that can be noted here is that truthfulness often depends on what the viewer wants. Omission of some data and distortion are generally used to highlight and provide useful information to map users. Very few maps of the U.S. will show all cities and roads. If straight line distances are wanted, road data can be omitted; but driving distances require such data. Driving times depend not only on the road types but conditions such as weather and tr affic as well. It would be interesting to see dynamic maps which incorporate current conditions, conditions for different days of the week and different holidays. Maps thus distorted woul d in fact be more truthful and useful than the currently available directions available on the web. In the previous section we have discussed some techniques for directing attention to and within vi sualizations. In this section we will show how they can be inco rporated into data graphics, specifically when used in automated generation  X  however, the same application methodology is general enough to be usable by both machines and humans. 
Table 1. Crude oil prices (in the year X s dollars, source: [27]) A data graphic can be thought of as a coordinate space into which data values are mapped [3]. The coordinate space as well as the data markers that sit in it can have many properties, such as color, shape, etc. Its properties can even change over time. Given this framework, we can apply transformations to the properties of the data marks and the coordinate space, and achieve the effects that enable better persuasion. In this perspective, capturing the viewer X s interest translates to applying transformations to the properties of the coordinate spaces which compose the data graphic. Visual enhancements are the same; changes are made to the selected parts of the data graphic to achieve emphasis. Distortion techniques become mathematical functions on the coordinate space itself. It should not be difficult to vary emphasis in information graphics, especially if the visualization is displayed on computer screens, given the support of dynamic presentations inherent with computers. However, existing au tomated visualization generation systems are based on a recipe-style generation, in that the graphical components are cons trained to some pre-coded combinations. Thus, even some simple variations such as color changes are not available w ithout programming, and grid transforms as shown for the crude oil price examples are simply not possible without extensive change s to these systems. In order to go beyond the capabilities of existing systems and incorporate persuasiveness, we ha ve implemented a prototype system called Morpherspective [3], based on hierarchical compositions of dollars transformable coordinate spaces, the visual properties and relationships of which can be used to describe a large class of information graphics. Figure 9 illustrates how we decompose a scatter plot. The primary difference between our appr oach and the previous ones is that everything in the graphic, including the base with the axis, is considered a coordinate space. Thus the black base with the axis is the same entity as a red dot, except that they have different properties such as color and size, and are in different hierarchical positions. There are no pre-coded formats  X  instead every graphic is built from scratch. As data structures can all be considered hierarchical (relational/flat data has two levels: root and records), there is a one-to-one correspondence between the graphical structure composed of coordinate spaces and the data that the visualization encodes. Thus, Morpherspectiv e X s generation process simply maps the data to the graphical structure using a greedy algorithm: Algorithm GenerateGraph : 1 Create a coordinate space for the current record/object 2 For each of the fields/attributes 3 Evaluate available properties to select a property p Map field/attribute to property p 5 For each of the children records/objects Call GenerateGraph recursively In line 3 of the algorithm a visual property is selected for encoding the data. This selection is based on a numerical evaluation measure incorporating both the expressiveness of the property as well as the persuasive component. For the former, as visual properties have different effi ciencies (cost of interpretation) for different data types [1, 15, 16], depending on how well a particular property expresses a variable of a certain type (numerical, ordinal, nominal such as text strings), a value and a cost (of interpretation) is assigned to the pair. For the latter, Morpherspective supports the fo llowing supplementary inputs: Personalization and other customiza tions for interesting the user can be expressed as preferences, numerical adjustments to the values and costs. Emphasis can be incorporated with either the relative importance or emphasis levels and functions (both system-encoded and user-definable). Given that the human visual system is not completely unders tood, all numerical values are approximate, based on orderings fro m previous research such as Bertin X s [1]; however, as the values and costs can be easily adjusted and the selection process does not depend on any properties having a particular eval uated measure, the values and costs can be easily updated as new research results are published. In selecting visual properties, the one with the highest net value is chosen, so that the net value of the graph can be optimized via the following equations: where E e and E o are the effectiveness measures of the encodings and the non-data-encoded operations (properties set according to preferences such as background color, for example) in the information graphic, and E C is the effectiveness of the children graphs, computed recursively. V i iterates through all the value adjustments of the encoding, including the basic value for the encoding according to the data type, as well as preference adjustments. R e stands for the relative importance of the variable encoded, while C j represents the cost adjustments, including the basic cost related to encoding th e data type and the operations used, as well as task and adjustments. The evaluation measures as given are obviously linear; this is due the prototypical nature of the project  X  as a simple way to incorporate all the different va lues the linear model provides a starting point and a good way to see how varying the different inputs affect the output. Further research will likely result in more complex models for evaluating the effectiveness of graphs. As the algorithm and evaluation m easure shows, the information graphics generated by Morpherspective can be easily adjusted for the different objectives of the us er; and without the supplementary inputs the output would simply be the traditional unbiased graphs. The Morpherspective system has been tested with a variety of data of different types, including hierarchical/structured data. To show the incorporation of persuasiveness that the system is capable of, we have used it to pl ot the crude oil example shown in figures 7 and 8, and the result is shown in figure 10, with green foreground and black background preferences [3]. As we have mentioned the Minard graphic earlier, it is fitting that we should show the versions that Morpherspective has generated automatically, one which simply presents the data (figure 11 [3]), and the other incorporating emphasis to highlight the toll of war (figure 12 [3]), by using red to shown the advancing troop strength and varying the width of the links to reinforce the impression of troop strength. (Acco rding to the inscription on his graph, red is what Minard used ; it has presumably faded over the years, as noted in [31]. This is an excellent real-life illustration of the importance of emphasis: Tufte [27] praised this graph for its muted colors, failing to read the inscription, which was not emphasized -the principle of maxi mization of data ink ratio [27] does not work if the viewer does not read what the data ink encodes. Of course, when Minard originally penned the graph the red color would have been very obvious; yet this illustrates that it is quite easy for viewers to miss certain information if it is not emphasized.) More colors are also used with figure 12, as color tends to bring attention to the graphic. To better illustrate the process, we will delve into the Minard example (specifically figure 11) a bit more. The data is presented in XML format (converted from data tables in [31]), and following Minard X s original data, there is no latitude associated with the weather. The sample data points are: Since the main point of this gra ph is to show how the number of troops dwindled throughout the marc h, the task we will use is  X Compare X  (pre-defined in the system), which basically advocates for the use of position, size, and color saturation for encoding data. The relative importance is left at default values, as there is no especially relevant data, except possibly the troop numbers; and by virtue of the  X Troop X  node having more children than the others, it will be mapped first. We also specify that we want lines between the various data points, as Morpherspective does not assume that lines are wanted. The only other preferences we have specified for figure 11 is that the system put a bit of padding so that the data marks do not collide with the axes, and the script font used. The system begins by creating a coordinate space for the  X root X  which is implicit in every graph. Then it examines the  X Troop X  node, starting with longitude, which is mapped into the x-position because it is a number, and positi onal mappings are considered to be the best for numerical values. In similar fashion the latitude is mapped to the y-position. Since Morpherspective is currently 2-dimensional, the  X Number X  field ge ts mapped to the size, as there are no more positions left. The direction field is considered ordinal [16] (as it has 2 values, A for advance and R for retreat), so it is mapped to a color component (blue is the default as red is considered  X emphasis X  by the system). The system next maps the  X City X  node. As it has the  X Longitude X  and  X Latitude X  fields in the same hierarchical level as the  X Troop X  node, the system uses the previous mappings so the cities are mapped to the same coordinates as the troops. As th e names are of  X nominal X  type [16] and can have any value, the system uses text strings. The  X Weather X  node is next. As it has no  X Latitude X  but has  X Longitude X , the system splits the original coordinate space automatically and aligns the tw o sub-coordinate spaces along the longitude values, maps the temperature to position (y because x is taken by longitude), and uses te xt strings for the dates, thus creating the graphic in figure 11. Two other preferences are added to make figure 12: empha sis for troop loss (the  X Number X  field), and to use blue color for text.

Figure 12. Morpherspective-generated version of Minard X s This paper has shown some of the ways that agendas can be incorporated into data graphics without compromising the truth. These are general principles which can be easily incorporated into visualization design. Emphasis and distortion techniques have solid mathematical foundations, a nd as all computer-generated data graphics have numerically based colors, object shapes and sizes, including them only depends on the flexibility of the system. Directing viewer X s atte ntion and having different views or perspectives for different viewers only depend upon the incorporation of personalizati on and customization techniques now in use in many web-based applications. A prototype automated visua lization generation system, Morpherspective, has been implemented, which incorporates these principles of persuasion. We have presented some of its output to illustrate the use of emphasis in information graphics. There are many guides on how to write better papers. Perhaps due to the power of visualization, generally the guides to graphic design tend to focus on how not to lie. But we believe that there should be rules on how to present better graphics to more effectively persuade viewers of the messages therein, and this paper has summarized some rules from the principles discussed.
