 Social media websites are currently central hubs on the Internet . Major online social media platforms are not only places for individual users to socialize but are increasingly more important as channels for companies to advertise , public figures to engage, etc. In order to optimize such advertising and engaging efforts , there is an emerging challenge for knowledge discovery on today X  X  Internet. The goal of knowledge discovery is to understand the entire online social landscape instead of mere ly summarizing the statistics . To answer this challenge, we have created VOXSUP as a unified social engagement framework. Unlike most existing tools, VOXSUP not only aggregates and filters social data from the Internet, but also provides what we call Voxsupian Knowledge Discovery (VKD). VKD consists of an almost human -level understanding of social conversations at any level of granularity from a single comment sentiment to multi -lingual inter -platform user demographics . Here we describe the technologies that are crucial to VKD, and subsequently go beyond experimental verification and present case studies from our live VOXSUP system . H.3.3 [ Information Storage And Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  Information filtering, Selec tion process Algorithms, Experimentation . Opinion mining, Topic model , Social ranking . Online social media websites are currently among the most popular Internet applications . Hundreds of millions of Internet users go to webs ites like Facebook and Twitter several times a day. Naturally , the massive use of public social media has become valuable for scientific research due to the large amount of human -generated content s. Social media can be used as datasets and attract a lot of academic interests ranging from large -scale complex network modeling to individual behavioral targeting [ 1]. Previous works dealing with social media data return impressive results in many well -defined problems. For example , sentence -level sentiment analy sis done by [ 2] is used in real applications . VOXSUP archi tecture is shown in Figure 1. In short, VOXSUP monitors multi -lingual social media content , performs sentiment analysis on this content , pushes it to scalable infrastructure, and finally extracts the human -level knowledge from this content . VOXSUP monitors multiple channels of social media in more than 7 languages , these channels include over 10,000 of the most popular Facebook public walls , over 3,000 Twitter handles, over 800 YouTube Channels, over 2,000 fo the most popular Google+ public pages , over 1, 500 LinkedIn company profiles , over 500 product categories with customer reviews from Amazon .com and over 300 active b log sites and online forums . For most of these sou rce s, we have all its data to date since 2009 or its inception. In VOXSUP , we try to keep as much information as possible without violating any regulations. For example, for each Facebook wall, we keep all public comments,  X  X ikes X  , and public user profile s. Despite VOXSUP  X  X  enormous capacity, we can still keep our data synchron ized with the providing media in soft real time . For sentiment analysis, we use our state -of-the -art Sentiment Elicitation S ystem (SES). Complete details can be found in [ 2]. The final sentiment is obtained by combining the three results through a random forest model. VOXSUP is designed to be a cutting edge data mining system that is (almost) always available, highly durable, and easily scalable . Different from many data mining projects, which first receive a massive, static dataset and then perform mining task s on it, VOXSUP contains a cluster of several transactional databases and high-dimensional data warehouse s. Each social channel VOXSUP monitors , e.g. Facebook, has an individual transactional database that has to handle soft real time u pdates as the source channel updates . While e nabling this feature for just the 10,000 walls Facebook is not trivial, VOXSUP does it for almost all major social media. What is more challenging is how to make sense of this massive amount of data from so many different yet correlated sources. The i ndividual transactional database for each source in VOXSUP scales easily because such databases are independent of one another. However, this independency vanishes when we build the data warehouse. For example, an end-user may be interested in knowing what the hot topic talked about by certain group of social users is; he/she wants to know this for the entire social landscape . Traditional independent analytics on i ndividual platforms will be, at best, biased estimates . VOXSUP can discover knowledge in real time from cross -platform heterogeneous information and therefore give end-users timely and unbiased insights. To support demanding data mining tasks like the above example, we enable free text search on all of the te xt in our system through multiple scalable indexing / searching solutions. VKD provides comprehensive , unbiased, actionable insights of the entire social top ology through its 3 major components: Theme Canvas  X  discovery, u ser profile discovery, and precise interests discovery . Theme Canvas  X  discovers the most talked about keywords and phrases for any given social channel in any given time interval. Different from traditional  X  X ord cloud  X  applications, Theme Canvas  X  encodes general social opinions associated with each term in gradients of two colors, and represents the scope or influence of each topic / term by its font size on canvas ; clicking on any of the phrase take s the end -user to all of the original sentence s/paragraph s that mentions the chosen phrase . We find and  X  p = sup Just as TIME magazine ranks the most influential people on both positive and negative impact, in the Voxsup Influence Score we take the absolute val ue of the sentiment to accommodate such consideration. W e empirically approximate the effect of sentimental strength by scalar multiplication. An alternative approach in our practice is to use power scale: SC [ i ] =  X  p  X  s . The scores shown in Figure 3 are normalized between 0 and 100. Figure 3 contains some examples of Voxsup Influence Score.
 Precise interests discovery analyzes the entire public social web and extract s the most relevant/interesting items to a given description . A description here me ans a description of an interest ; it could be a brand, a phrase, a group of users, etc. For example, the brand  X  X ercedes -Benz X  is a description of an interest in luxury cars. VOXSUP system would then quer y its social database and returns a list of relevant interests that share a similar demographic as the chosen interest. Voxsupian precise interests are particularly useful for the behavioral targeting world. The screenshots in Figure 4 can best illustrate the Voxsupian precise interest. Figure 4 (a) and (b) show two different ways to explore the interests: breadth first and depth first . In the interests graph, we apply the same algorithm to each node interest to get a list of interests and sort the output by  X  X ift X . This is an atomic operation, which we call probe . Each probe terminates on a user -set lift threshold. By setting the threshold to just the interest with the highest lift, probe becomes depth first; otherwise, it is breadth first. Suppose X is a random variable denoting averag e social user X  X  interest distribution and if we are given two interest descriptions x () Pr X = x 1 () . Figure 4 (c) further shows the lift numbe rs on category level. VOXSUP assigns categories of interests by clustering the interests based on their online demographic s [5].
