 This tutorial will discuss vulnerabilities of collaborative recommendation algorithms: attacks that can be mounted against them and possible defenses that can be used. The tutorial will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in the area of collaborative recommendation. K.6.5 [ Management of Computing and Information Systems ] Security and Protection Algorithms, Reliability, Security Recommender systems, Collaborative filtering, Security, Robustness The openness and anonymity of the Internet environment create many hazards for e-commerce. For collaborative recommender systems, it raises the possibility of that attackers will seek to bias the output recommendations through manipulation of the public inputs that the system permits. Fighting such manipulation is a constant battle for the owners and maintainers of such systems. In this tutorial, we will examine r ecent work trying to quantify the vulnerabilities of collaborative recommendation and to propose defenses against manipulation. We will concentrate particularly on attacks that have a specific economic motivation, that is, attack s that aim to make a particular item recommended more or less of ten or more or less highly. There are other forms of deliberate disruption that an attacker might attempt such as spoofing or denial of service  X  attacks possible against any web application. In this forum, we will
