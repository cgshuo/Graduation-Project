 1. Introduction and principal results  X  X  The strongest human instinct is to impart information. The second strongest is to resist it . X  Widely attributed to Scottish author Kenneth Grahame [1859 X 1932].

Information science, since its inception, has studied information use , as demonstrated by a survey of the literature of information science and related disciplines. For example, the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST) published Allen X  X  review of information needs ( 1969, p. 3 ). Prior reviews had focused on information use via information systems such as index card files, catalogs, and classification systems, but Allen X  X  review centered on the user . In 1986,
ARIST published a review by Dervin and Nilan (1986) of studies between 1978 and 1986 that followed this emphasis on  X  information use and user , an emphasis called by some a  X  X  X ser turn. X  Dervin and Nilan (1986), Westbrook (1993), Westbrook (1995), Bates (1999), Wilson (1994, 1981, p. 3, 1997, 1999a, 1999b, 2000), Case (2002), and Fisher, Erdelez, and McKechnie (2005) comprise a very small sample of this  X  X  X ser X  literature.

Over the last 60 years, however, less than 1% of the literature of information science has addressed information nonuse , whether from a systems or a user viewpoint ( Houston, 2009 ). Notable reviews of nonuse appear in Zipf (1949), Dervin (1973), Wurman (1989, 2001), Wilson (1997), Case (2002), and Houston (2009) . No review other than Houston (2009) has studied the subset of nonuse of information termed Compelled Nonuse of Information (CNI).
 study reported in this paper established the characteristics and boundaries of CNI and related the elements of CNI, one to another, in the hierarchical taxonomy of Fig. 1 . Full explanations and examples of each element of the taxonomy appear in Houston (2009) .

I believe that the publication of this taxonomy will provide information workers with a comprehensive checklist that will unaware of the advertiser X  X  message. The social worker could consider various reasons that a client remains in a societally disadvantaged position. The psychiatrist could use the checklist to weigh the risks and benefits of intervention in cases where a patient X  X  nonuse of information permitted the patient to cope with intolerable thoughts or memories. Having a com-prehensive checklist and, therefore, access to more options, these information workers would be better prepared to make the most efficient and effective response.

Information science already describes many elements of CNI, but information science does so through thousands of highly taxonomy of the six primary mechanisms and 28 secondary mechanisms. The taxonomy adds value to and organizes the hundreds of discrete models of information behavior.

As with statistics, this taxonomy allows the information worker to  X  X  X ee through the noise X  of the hundreds of models, to points of individual behavior, and to reduce the hundreds of models to a quantity more easily remembered. For example,
Chatman proposed 23 models or theories of information behavior, and these 23 resolve to the six mechanisms of the taxon-omy ( Houston, 2009, p. 41 ).
 cise definition, I have formulated the following: formulating his definition, Bateson was trying to quantify information (cf. Harmon, 1984, 1986 ), to develop a calculus of present the definition commonly recognized as his, as diagrammed in Fig. 2 .

The study reported here continues in two respects Bateson X  X  quest for a calculus of information. First , conditions leading able. The ordinal scale merely takes information science a step further toward determining whether CNI can be quantified.
Second , the elements in the present taxonomy of conditions leading to CNI appear to conform to the fundamental laws of modern physics, specifically, the conservation laws of classical mechanics: conservation of mass, conservation of energy, conservation of momentum, and the like. I summarize these fundamental laws very crudely and anthropomorphically by the expression:  X  X  X hings do not like to change. X  The elements in this taxonomy appear to represent, each in its own way, maintenance of status quo and a concordance to the classical mechanics of modern physics. Whether the analogy proves of information as defined by Bateson and investigated CNI within that universe. 2. The methodology of the study of CNI
The study of this previously unexamined absence of behavior (i.e., NOT using information) involved the development of a new methodology, an iterative recognition of absence, called here Retroductive Recognition of Absence (RRA).  X  X  X bsence, X  in this sense, resembles tangentially the  X  X  X he problem of non-specifiability of information need X  addressed by Belkin X  X  Anom-posed by Charles Sanders Peirce (1839 X 1914) and earlier termed abduction by Peirce. RRA involves the iterative performance of a nine-step heuristic: 1. Perceive a phenomenon leading to surprise 2. Perform the fundamental and primary retroduction 3. Synthesize the phenomenon into a judgment, hypothesis, or retroductive suggestion 4. Bracket intuitive prejudices 5. Immerse in the data 6. Conceptualize 7. Hypothesize 8. Select the hypothesis most efficient to entertain, interrogate, or test 9. Entertain, interrogate, or test the hypothesis.
 The iterations continue until the researcher reaches a hypothesis testable by inductive or deductive methods.
RRA shares many characteristics with grounded theory (cf. Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008, 1967 ). This study used a methodology based on retroductive reasoning instead of grounded theory for several interrelated reasons, many of which Rennie (1998) has expressed. As further explained below, retroductive reasoning lends itself to the study of newly identified phenomena, while methods such as grounded theory have been used effectively in areas with established vocabularies or previous stud-ognized phenomena. Conversely, the prescribed procedures of grounded theory apply to studies that build on pre-existing ductive methodology such as RRA to investigate CNI.

People develop ideas by inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning, and retroductive reasoning. As used here, induction is  X  X  X easoning from observations to theories X  ( Honderich, 1995, p. 405 ), while deduction is reasoning from theories to exploratory studies, however, where neither prior systematic observations nor theories exist, the researcher will find both inductive and deductive reasoning inapplicable. Thus:  X  X  X ll the ideas of science come to it by the way of Abduction [Retro-of retroduction during his long, prolific, and largely unpublished writing career, equated retroduction with terms such as than would reliance on deductive or inductive reasoning, but the exploration of a new idea would permit of no other method of reasoning:
Abduction [retroduction] is no more nor less than guessing, a faculty attributed to Yankees. ( X ) Such validity as this has consists in the generalization that no new truth is ever otherwise reached while some new truths are thus reached. (1976, pp. 319 X 320, from Peirce X  X  1902  X  X  X rolegmena X ).

Possibly because of Peirce X  X  extensive training in the physical sciences, he and his followers considered retroduction not the train.
 Neither Peirce nor his followers ever presented a complete heuristic for a retroductive methodology such as RRA, but Rennie (1998, p. 111) articulated Steps 3 X 5, Peirce (1976, pp. 319 X 320) suggested other steps in his various writings, and Bergman and Paavola (2001) added nuances that clarified the process. The  X  X  X eta-methodology X  by which I created the
RRA methodology resembled nothing so much as assembling archeological potsherds. I collected the steps from the writings of Peirce, Rennie, and Bergman and Paavola, noted which steps appeared to be congruent and which steps required the prior prising absence while increasing the depth of examination. 2.1. Step 1. Perceive a phenomenon, leading to surprise
The surprise that led to the formulation of the RRA methodology and to a model of Compelled Nonuse of Information (CNI) resulted from a contemplation of the anti-intellectualism described by Hofstadter (1963) and other behavior involving non-irrationality, a facility for eidetic imagery rather than symbolic imagery, and mismatches between information and the mul-tiple intelligences proposed by Gardner (1983) . The number of discrete aspects surprised me. Further, those who study or work with information usually deplore nonuses of information such as censorship, propaganda, anti-intellectualism, and of this ambiguity also surprised me. 2.2. Step 2. Perform a fundamental and primary retroduction
A search of electronic and print databases for examples of the aspects mentioned above of nonuse of information pro-duced no comprehensive treatments of nonuse of information. The examples of nonuse that appeared were well defined but extremely limited in application and interpretation. The examples bore relationships, one to another, although no such relationships appeared explicitly in the works discussing the examples. For example, Chatman (1985, p. 277) found that the be a worthwhile addition to information science, in part because it seemed such a common behavior and in part because understandable, and worth the effort to conduct. Such an intuitive leap is the hallmark of the retroductive process.
In the study reported here, patterns of information behavior began to emerge from the examples of nonuse . These patterns were far less numerous than the hundreds of models of information use that have appeared in the literature of information science. These patterns, when organized into a classification scheme, presented a taxonomy with internal consistency, that ditions that could lead to nonuse of information, a model for employment by information professionals. This realization led to the retroductive suggestion that an explanatory model of nonuse could organize and facilitate the study of information behavior, a field currently focused largely on information use . With such a retroduction verbalized, the groundwork was ready for Step 4. 2.4. Step 4. Bracket intuitive prejudices about the phenomenon
Many people hold intuitive prejudices about nonuse of information, that it somehow is morally  X  X  X ad, X  ubiquitous, virtu-those examples, cases appeared in which nonuse of information benefited the nonuser. For example, psychodynamic defense 2006 , pp. 518 X 519). In other words, nonuse, as such, seems neither helpful nor harmful to the potential nonuser, and the nonuser is neither morally good nor bad by not using information. Significantly, what also appeared in the examples was an indication of the difference between volitional nonuse of information and compelled nonuse of information. This realiza-ence that was to prove extremely important in subsequent steps.

Another apparently common intuitive prejudice about nonuse of information involves the nature of authoritarianism and its employment of mechanisms of nonuse of information to control others. Many people view authoritarianism and its mech-or perpetuation of their control at the expense of the controlled. Some amount of authoritarian control and manipulation of may be by physical force or by manipulation of information, tactics discussed by Servan (1767, p. 35) , quoted by Foucault, (1977, p. 102):
A stupid despot may constrain his slaves with iron chains; but a true politician binds them even more strongly by the in that we do not know of what it is made and we believe it to be our own work.

The sources of the most powerful of  X  X  X heir own ideas X  are, almost by definition, hidden, and the implantation of such information about the merits of the rules.

Any act of selection involves omission of the phenomena not selected. The limits of human cognition vary from individual in a weakening of authoritarian control, they would have constituted Bateson X  X   X  X  X ifference that makes a difference. X  These unselected ideas thereby qualify as nonused information. Having bracketed prejudices such as those mentioned above (non-use is bad; authoritarian control is bad), I was ready to employ Step 5. 2.5. Step 5. Immerse in the data
In this study of nonuse of information, published examples of nonuse became data, using a technique similar to evaluative ship of the examples to other examples of nonuse of information determined whether the examples comprised use or nonuse of information, that is, whether the examples became data for this study.

An informal pilot study began with Step 5 and involved a search of specific databases of the literature of information of combinations of the keywords:  X  X  X nformation, X   X  X  X nowledge, X   X  X  X onuse, X   X  X  X on-use, X   X  X  X ejection, X  and  X  X  X voidance. X  The data-bases searched included: Academic Search Premier (1965 to date), Web of Science (ISI Web of Knowledge, 1975 to date), Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA, 1969 to date), Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 to date),
Library Chronicle Index (1970 X 1989), and the printed annual indexes found in volumes 1 through 40 (1966 X 2006) of the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology ( ARIST ).

The search also included an examination of the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) for terms that might make the database search more comprehensive. The LCSH contained 26 headings that included the term  X  X  X nformation, X  with 11 study appeared in the LCSH, indicating a possible gap in the LCSH classification of literature about nonuse of information. 2.5.1. Results of the first immersion
This search identified approximately 400 works, each containing at least one of the search term phrases and describing at information X  identified approximately 43,000 works. A second search, this one of the database Expanded Academic ASAP , re-about use of slightly less than 1%.

During the course of the study, no literature appeared that discussed the size of the disparity between the number of arti-nonuse of information, and the concept of System Justification Theory.

Regardless of the reason for the preponderance of articles about information use , I expect the development of theory and practice about nonuse to decrease the disparity between the number of research papers about use and nonuse of information. 2.5.2. Analysis of the results of the first immersion
A rudimentary form of content analysis determined the characteristics of nonuse of information present in each article. In ity) proved unnecessary because the purpose of this pilot study was to develop concepts rather than to generate data. Ini-tially, the coding themes consisted of the themes of nonuse of information developed in the early phases of the study. When the occurrences of  X  X  X onuse X  in the corpus did not appear to match previously established themes, new themes appeared and joined the original themes. 2.5.3. Comparison of the taxonomy with models of information behavior
The next phase of the informal pilot study consisted of a merging of the preliminary version of the taxonomy of con-ditions leading to CNI with the models of information behavior. This merging consisted of noting the explanatory power of each element of the taxonomy for each model of information behavior.  X  X  X xplanatory X  means that the elements of the taxonomy might present an analytical framework that would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the infor-mation behavior. In addition,  X  X  X xplanatory X  refers to the concept that the relatively few elements of the taxonomy would be easier to conceptualize than would be the hundreds of models of information behavior. For example, Alienation Theory ( Chatman, 1990 ) postulates that information and most life-events are meaningless to the alienated due to powerlessness, onomy X  X   X  X  X solation X  help to describe Chatman X  X  Alienation Theory? Yes, in Chatman X  X  example, work schedules caused so-cial, physical, and temporal isolation of night-working janitors that prevented their interaction with society and contributed to a concise description of Alienation Theory. Three elements of the taxonomy: environmental barriers (phys-23 separate models or theories of information behavior resolve to the six related mechanisms of the taxonomy ( Houston, 2009, p. 41 ), indicating a more efficient explanatory power of the taxonomy. In an example from Nahl (2004) , the tax-onomy X  X   X  X  X ffect X  mechanism described Nahl X  X  Affective Load Theory. When applied to the 118 models of information behavior collected for this study, the taxonomy described 55 of these 118 behaviors through the six mechanisms. The other 63 models described information use (e.g., berrypicking by Bates (1989) ) rather than nonuse, or information behav-iors unconnected to use and nonuse (e.g., Cognitive Work Analysis by Rasmussen, Pejtersen, and Goodstein (1994) ).
Establishing correspondences between the taxonomy and the information behaviors revealed overlapping definitions among the elements of the taxonomy. Resolving these overlaps led to refining the taxonomy by defining the nuances of its elements, and this refining occurred in Step 6.
 2.6. Step 6. Form new conceptions bearing some degree of ordering
The examples of nonuse of information discovered during the informal pilot study clustered into six themes (intrinsic so-matic/bodily conditions, socio-environmental barriers, authoritarian controls, threshold knowledge shortfall, attention use of information. These conditions suggested ordinal continua along which they might fall: intensity  X  the amount of additional information required to overcome the nonuse, obversibility  X  the likelihood of an opposing theme appearing, repeatability  X  how many times a theme could affect the same person in the same situation, effect on soma  X  how strongly the theme affected the body, rather than mental processes, class  X  how the theme might affect people of different socio-economic status, thought  X  degree of cognition required by the nonuse, timing  X  the point in the cognitive process at which the theme would occur, source  X  degree of originating internally or externally to the person, compulsion  X  status as either volitional or compelled, and other continua now discarded and forgotten. Each continuum, when organized as a taxonomy, produced taxa that con-tained themes that occurred in other taxa. In other words, each continuum contained overlapping taxa, except for the last continuum,  X  X  X tatus as either volitional or compelled X  nonuse of information. The realization of this volitional X  X ompelled dichotomy led to the next step, Step 7 (hypothesize for the surprising phenomenon). 2.7. Step 7. Hypothesize for the surprising phenomenon
The themes of nonuse of information displayed properties, one of which was personal autonomy, or the amount of volition exercised by someone not using information. This property manifested as the degree of control over the nonuse by the person not using the information. An ordering along a volitional X  X ompelled continuum of the conditions and information behaviors that led to nonuse of information quickly developed into a volitional X  X ompelled dichotomy. In other words, one example did not display slightly more control than another, but displayed either control (volitional nonuse) or no control (compelled nonuse). Many of the examples had only compelled elements, and volitional elements usually had compelled counterparts. The terms  X  X  X olitional X  and  X  X  X ompelled X  and the distinction between them did not appear explicitly in the literature examined for the pilot study of nonuse of information, yet this bifurcation between volitional and compelled permitted a visualization of the universe of nonuse of information clearly enough to identify the portion of particular interest to me. Because my academic interests gravitate to the topic of societal injustice to be associated with and underlie examples of societal injustice, I narrowed the scope of research from nonuse in gen-eral to Compelled Nonuse of Information (CNI). This more narrow scope and the selection of a term and its acronym that do not allow a difference to make a difference. X  This definition allowed me to formulate hypotheses in the form of various models of ordinal taxonomies of conditions that lead to CNI. The verbalization of this definition and these mod-els led to Step 8. 2.8. Step 8. Select the most efficient hypothesis
The preliminary Steps 1 X 7 generated several interrelated hypotheses: that an explanatory model of CNI (rather than the more general nonuse of information) could exist; that I could develop a model of CNI; and that the model would prove useful in understanding the empirical examples of information behavior that occur in the literature of information science and re-lated fields and in the practice of information professionals. Various models emerged from Step 7 as hypotheses (an example of another model appears in Houston, 2009 , Appendix 5), and I chose the model depicted in Fig. 1 above as the most eco-nomical to verify in Step 9. 2.9. Step 9. Inductively verify the hypothesis against the data as a whole
The term  X  X  X etroduction X  implies a returning, and, in this sense, the hypothesis of Step 8 is both the outcome of retro-duction and the font of new retroductions, returning or looking back to a prior step in the retroductive process. Specif-ically, I looked back to the last point at which I had perceived a phenomenon leading to a surprise. That point followed the pilot study, with the realization that nonuse of information consisted of CNI and VNI, and that this study should focus on CNI. Therefore, the retroduction cycle started again at Step 3: synthesizing the new phenomenon into a hypothesis.
That hypothesis took the form of a preliminary version of the taxonomy depicted in Fig. 1 above. I reflected on Step 4, bracketing intuitive prejudices, and began Step 5, immersion in the data, with the  X  X  X ormal Study, X  reported in the next section. 3. The second iteration and formulation of a final taxonomy terms used during the pilot study and terms thought of later, such as  X  X  X arrier X :
The results of this search generated no completely new conditions or information behaviors leading to CNI, but they did suggest sharper definitions of the existing conditions and a reorganization of parts of the taxonomy.
The search resulted in approximately 1400 articles that contained some form of the search terms. Many of these articles contained chance juxtapositions of the search terms; many contained examples of information use , rather than nonuse ; and many did not contain sufficient information to determine whether the described nonuse was compelled or volitional. From the approximately 1400 articles, 114 presented examples of CNI. 4. The third iteration and formulation of a final taxonomy
The second iteration of the CNI study produced a taxonomy that had changed very little and therefore demonstrated sta-bility. The volume of material, however, exceeded the human attention span, and I decided to re-code the articles based on the taxonomy, I felt that my conceptions of the themes of CNI might have altered. The third iteration of the RRA heuristic, therefore, consisted of reentering the heuristic at Step 5 (immerse in the data). This immersion consisted of re-coding the examples of nonuse of information found in the corpus of articles, using the taxonomy that resulted from the second iter-ation. Minor re-wording of the terms in the taxonomy resulted. The final taxonomy appeared to be so stable that I felt that the study of CNI was ready for inductive and deductive inquiry. 5. A summary of the retroductive procedure employed in this study
In any investigation involving retroduction, the outcome of an iteration of the retroduction heuristic determines the next tigation progresses beyond retroduction to those methods. If the iteration has produced a completely unexpected hypothesis, study consisted of a database search for terms derived from brainstorming and led to a preliminary taxonomy (Steps 1 X 9). formalstudyconsistedofadatabasesearchfortermsderivedfrominterrogationofthepreliminarytaxonomy,andtheresultsof
The adjustments to the taxonomy became smaller following each iteration of the heuristic, and I concluded after the third or deductive, rather than retroductive, research. 6. Recommendations for further study
This paper introduces a new subdivision of information science, CNI. If CNI is to become a useful concept for the infor-mation worker, its investigation should involve inductive and deductive methodologies and the investigation of corollary topics. This study of CNI suggested to me two corollary topics: (a) a model of covert compelled use of information (CCUI), and (b) a model of volitional nonuse of information (VNI). These two topics, with CNI, comprise a substantial portion of the field of information behavior established during the study of CNI, as diagrammed in Fig. 5 below. 6.1. Compelled use of information (CUI)
Compelled use of information (CUI) is a behavior that results from compulsions that either become obvious to, or remain hidden from, the person performing the behavior. I label the obvious compulsions overt CUI and the hidden compulsions the student will think inductively or deductively about reading the book and then decide whether to read the book. Such behavior would not be covert CUI because it would not be intuitive.

In covert CUI, the person performing the behavior remains unaware of the compulsion and has no chance to think about shore Boulevard and spaced the lines increasingly closer together before dangerous curves in the road. Drivers slowed down mirrors that made children appear somewhat heavier than they are. Children ate less because (according to Thaler &amp; Sun-stein, 2008 ) they perceived their mirrored selves as unflatteringly heavy. In these examples, the nudge apparently worked without the drivers consciously thinking about their speed or the children consciously thinking about their weight. Thaler and Sunstein drew these conclusions from the reported successes of the nudges when compared to the failures of overt and obvious behavior modification messages such as  X  X  X angerous curve ahead X  signs and public service obesity messages.
Rather than defining nudge as  X  X  X ny noncoercive alteration in the context in which people make decisions X  ( Goldstein, only. 6.2. Volitional nonuse of information (VNI)
In addition to CUI, another study of information behavior suggested by this study of CNI would be the completion of a taxonomy of volitional nonuse of information (VNI). Such a taxonomy would help to classify, evaluate, and apply to practice thousands of the reports now subsumed under the heading of  X  X  X ser studies X  and contribute significantly to the theoretical the absence of use of information), and the RRA methodology would be an especially appropriate method of conducting such a study and possibly the only method of commencing such a study. 7. Summary
This paper has presented a study of Compelled Nonuse of Information (CNI) culminating in a taxonomy of the six primary mechanisms of CNI: 1. Intrinsic somatic (bodily) conditions 2. Socio-environmental barriers 3. Authoritarian controls 4. Threshold knowledge shortfall 5. Attention shortfall 6. Information filtering.
 because the methodology to commence the study did not exist and because the literatures of information science, psychol-ogy, sociology, political science, education, and communication science did not contain papers about compelled nonuse of information, in and of itself. Thus, every stage of this endeavor ventured into unplumbed depths. The taxonomy undoubtedly tool to analyze information behavior and a new way of thinking about the relationships among the information scientist, information, the information practitioner, and the potential user of information.
