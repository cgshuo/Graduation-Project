 Over the last years the task of opinion mining (OM) has been the topic of many publications. It has been approached with different goals in mind: Some research strived to perform subjec-tivity analysis at the document or sentence level, without focusing on what the individual opinions uttered in the document are about. Other ap-proaches focused on extracting individual opinion words or phrases and what they are about. This aboutness has been referred to as the opinion tar-get or opinion topic in the literature from the field. In this work our goal is to extract opinion target -opinion word pairs from sentences from movie reviews. A challenge which is frequently encoun-tered in text mining tasks at this level of gran-ularity is, that entities are being referred to by anaphora. In the task of OM, it can therefore also be necessary to analyze more than the content of one individual sentence when extracting opinion targets. Consider this example sentence:  X  X imply put, it X  X  unfathomable that this movie cracks the Top 250. It is absolutely awful. X  . If one wants to extract what the opinion in the second sentence is about, an algorithm which resolves the anaphoric reference to the opinion target is required. The extraction of such anaphoric opinion targets has been noted as an open issue multiple times in the OM context (Zhuang et al., 2006; Hu and Liu, 2004; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003). It is not a marginal phenomenon, since Kessler and Nicolov (2009) report that in their data, 14% of the opin-ion targets are pronouns. However, the task of re-solving anaphora to mine opinion targets has not been addressed and evaluated yet to the best of our knowledge.
 In this work, we investigate whether anaphora res-olution (AR) can be successfully integrated into an OM algorithm and whether we can achieve an improvement regarding the OM in doing so. This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the related work on opinion target identification and OM on movie reviews. Section 3 outlines the OM algorithm we employed by us, while in Sec-tion 4 we discuss two different algorithms for AR which we experiment with. Finally, in Section 5 we present our experimental work including error analysis and discussion, and we conclude in Sec-tion 6. We split the description of the related work in two parts: In Section 2.1 we discuss the related work on OM with a focus on approaches for opinion target identification. In Section 2.2 we elaborate on findings from related OM research which also worked with movie reviews as this is our target domain in the present paper. 2.1 Opinion Target Identification The extraction of opinions and especially opin-ion targets has been performed with quite diverse approaches. Initial approaches combined statisti-cal information and basic linguistic features such as part-of-speech tags. The goal was to identify the opinion targets, here in form of products and their attributes, without a pre-built knowledge base which models the domain. For the target candidate identification, simple part-of-speech patterns were employed. The relevance ranking and extraction was then performed with different statistical mea-sures: Pointwise Mutual Information (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), the Likelihood Ratio Test (Yi et al., 2003) and Association Mining (Hu and Liu, 2004). A more linguistically motivated approach was taken by Kim and Hovy (2006) through iden-tifying opinion holders and targets with semantic role labeling. This approach was promising, since their goal was to extract opinions from profession-ally edited content i.e. newswire.
 Zhuang et al. (2006) present an algorithm for the extraction of opinion target -opinion word pairs. The opinion word and target candidates are iden-tified in the annotated corpus and their extraction is then performed by applying possible paths con-necting them in a dependency graph. These paths are combined with part-of-speech information and also learned from the annotated corpus.
 To the best of our knowledge, there is currently only one system which integrates coreference in-formation in OM. The algorithm by Stoyanov and Cardie (2008) identifies coreferring targets in newspaper articles. A candidate selection or ex-traction step for the opinion targets is not required, since they rely on manually annotated targets and focus solely on the coreference resolution. How-ever they do not resolve pronominal anaphora in order to achieve that. 2.2 Opinion Mining on Movie Reviews There is a huge body of work on OM in movie re-views which was sparked by the dataset from Pang and Lee (2005). This dataset consists of sen-tences which are annotated as expressing positive or negative opinions. An interesting insight was gained from the document level sentiment analy-sis on movie reviews in comparison to documents from other domains: Turney (2002) observes that the movie reviews are hardest to classify since the review authors tend to give information about the storyline of the movie which often contain charac-terizations, such as  X  X ad guy X  or  X  X iolent scene X  . These statements however do not reflect any opin-ions of the reviewers regarding the movie. Zhuang et al. (2006) also observe that movie reviews are different from e.g. customer reviews on Ama-zon.com. This is reflected in their experiments, in which their system outperforms the system by Hu and Liu (2004) which attributes an opinion tar-get to the opinion word which is closest regard-ing word distance in a sentence. The sentences in the movie reviews tend to be more complex, which can also be explained by their origin. The reviews were taken from the Internet Movie Database 1 , on which the users are given a set of guidelines on how to write a review. Due to these insights, we are confident that the overall textual quality of the movie reviews is high enough for linguisti-cally more advanced technologies such as parsing or AR to be successfully applied. 3.1 Dataset Currently the only freely available dataset anno-tated with opinions including annotated anaphoric opinion targets is a corpus of movie reviews by Zhuang et al. (2006). Kessler and Nicolov (2009) describe a collection of product reviews in which anaphoric opinion targets are also an-notated, but it is not available to the public (yet). Zhuang et al. (2006) used a subset of the dataset they published (1829 documents), namely 1100 documents, however they do not state which documents comprise this subset used in their eval-uation. In our experiments, we therefore use the complete dataset available, detailed in Table 1. As shown, roughly 9 . 5% of the opinion targets are re-ferred to by pronouns. Table 2 outlines detailed statistics on which pronouns occur as opinion tar-gets.
 3.2 Baseline Opinion Mining We reimplemented the algorithm presented by Zhuang et al. (2006) as the baseline for our experiments. Their approach is a supervised one. The annotated dataset is split in five folds, of which four are used as the training data. In the first step, opinion target and opinion word candidates are extracted from the training data. Frequency counts of the annotated opinion targets and opin-ion words are extracted from four training folds. The most frequently occurring opinion targets and opinion words are selected as candidates. Then the annotated sentences are parsed and a graph containing the words of the sentence is created, which are connected by the dependency relations between them. For each opinion target -opinion word pair, the shortest path connecting them is extracted from the dependency graph. A path consists of the part-of-speech tags of the nodes and the dependency types of the edges.
 In order to be able to identify rarely occurring opinion targets which are not in the candidate list, they expand it by crawling the cast and crew names of the movies from the IMDB. How this crawling and extraction is done is not explained. As pointed out by Charniak and Elsner (2009) there are hardly any freely available systems for AR. Although Charniak and Elsner (2009) present a machine-learning based algorithm for AR, they evaluate its performance in comparison to three non machine-learning based algorithms, since those are the only ones available. They observe that the best performing baseline algo-rithm (OpenNLP) is hardly documented. The al-gorithm with the next-to-highest results in (Char-niak and Elsner, 2009) is MARS (Mitkov, 1998) from the GuiTAR (Poesio and Kabadjov, 2004) toolkit. This algorithm is based on statistical anal-ysis of the antecedent candidates. Another promis-ing algorithm for AR employs a rule based ap-proach for antecedent identification. The Cog-NIAC algorithm (Baldwin, 1997) was designed for high-precision AR. This approach seems like an adequate strategy for our OM task, since in the dataset used in our experiments only a small fraction of the total number of pronouns are ac-tual opinion targets (see Table 1). We extended the CogNIAC implementation to also resolve  X  X t X  and  X  X his X  as anaphora candidates, since off-the-shelf it only resolves personal pronouns. We will refer to this extension with [id] . Both algorithms fol-low the common approach that noun phrases are antecedent candidates for the anaphora. In our ex-periments we employed both the MARS and the CogNIAC algorithm, for which we created three extensions which are detailed in the following. 4.1 Extensions of CogNIAC We identified a few typical sources of errors in a preliminary error analysis. We therefore sug-gest three extensions to the algorithm which are on the one hand possible in the OM setting and on the other hand represent special features of the target discourse type: [1.] We observed that the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005) is superior to the Person detection of the (MUC6 trained) CogNIAC implementation. We therefore filter out Person antecedent candidates which the Stanford NER detects for the imper-sonal and demonstrative pronouns and Location &amp; Organization candidates for the personal pro-nouns. This way the input to the AR is optimized. [2.] The second extension exploits the fact that re-views from the IMDB exhibit certain contextual properties. They are gathered and to be presented in the context of one particular entity (=movie). The context or topic under which it occurs is there-fore typically clear to the reader and is therefore not explicitly introduced in the discourse. This is equivalent to the situational context we often refer to in dialogue. In the reviews, the authors often refer to the movie or film as a whole by a pro-noun. We exploit this by an additional rule which resolves an impersonal or demonstrative pronoun to  X  X ovie X  or  X  X ilm X  if there is no other (match-ing) antecedent candidate in the previous two sen-tences. [3.] The rules by which CogNIAC resolves anaphora were designed so that anaphora which have ambiguous antecedents are left unresolved. This strategy should lead to a high precision AR, but at the same time it can have a negative impact on the recall. In the OM context, it happens quite frequently that the authors comment on the entity they want to criticize in a series of arguments. In such argument chains, we try to solve cases of an-tecedent ambiguity by analyzing the opinions: If there are ambiguous antecedent candidates for a pronoun, we check whether there is an opinion ut-tered in the previous sentence. If this is the case and if the opinion target matches the pronoun re-garding gender and number, we resolve the pro-noun to the antecedent which was the previous opinion target.
 In the results of our experiments in Section 5, we will refer to the configurations using these exten-sions with the numbers attributed to them above. To integrate AR in the OM algorithm, we add the antecedents of the pronouns annotated as opinion targets to the target candidate list. Then we ex-tract the dependency paths connecting pronouns and opinion words and add them to the list of valid paths. When we run the algorithm, we extract anaphora which were resolved, if they occur with a valid dependency path to an opinion word. In such a case, the anaphor is substituted for its an-tecedent and thus extracted as part of an opinion target -opinion word pair.
 To reproduce the system by Zhuang et al. (2006), we substitute the cast and crew list employed by them (see Section 3.2), with a NER compo-nent (Finkel et al., 2005). One aspect regarding the extraction of opinion target -opinion word pairs remains open in Zhuang et al. (2006): The de-pendency paths only identify connections between pairs of single words. However, almost 50% of the opinion target candidates are multiword ex-pressions. Zhuang et al. (2006) do not explain how they extract multiword opinion targets with the de-pendency paths. In our experiments, we require a dependency path to be found to each word of a multiword target candidate for it to be extracted. Furthermore, Zhuang et al. (2006) do not state whether in their evaluation annotated multiword targets are treated as a single unit which needs to be extracted, or whether a partial matching is em-ployed in such cases. We require all individual words of a multiword expression to be extracted by the algorithm. As mentioned above, the depen-dency path based approach will only identify con-nections between pairs of single words. We there-fore employ a merging step, in which we combine adjacent opinion targets to a multiword expres-sion. We have compiled two result sets: Table 3 shows the results of the overall OM in a five-fold cross-validation. Table 4 gives a detailed overview of the AR for opinion target identification summed up over all folds. In Table 4, a true positive refers to an extracted pronoun which was annotated as an opinion target and is resolved to the correct antecedent. A false positive subsumes two error classes: A pronoun which was not annotated as an opinion target but extracted as such, or a pronoun which is resolved to an incorrect antecedent. As shown in Table 3, the recall of our reimplemen-tation is slightly higher than the recall reported in Zhuang et al. (2006). However, our precision and thus f-measure are lower. This can be at-tributed to the different document sets used in our experiments (see Section 3.1), or our substitution of the list of peoples X  names with the NER compo-nent, or differences regarding the evaluation strat-egy as mentioned above.
 We observe that the MARS algorithm yields an improvement regarding recall compared to the baseline system. However, it also extracts a high number of false positives for both the personal and impersonal / demonstrative pronouns. This is due to the fact that the MARS algorithm is designed for robustness and always resolves a pronoun to an antecedent.
 CogNIAC in its off-the-shelf configuration already yields significant improvements over the baseline regarding f-measure 2 . Our CogNIAC extension [id] improves recall slightly in comparison to the off-the-shelf system. As shown in Table 4, the algorithm extracts impersonal and demonstrative pronouns with lower precision than personal pro-nouns. Our error analysis shows that this is mostly due to the Person / Location / Organization clas-sification of the CogNIAC implementation. The names of actors and movies are thus often misclas-sified. Extension [1] mitigates this problem, since it increases precision (Table 3 row 6), while not af-fecting recall. The overall improvement of our ex-tensions [id] + [1] is however not statistically sig-nificant in comparison to off-the-shelf CogNIAC. Our extensions [2] and [3] in combination with [id] each increase recall at the expense of preci-sion. The improvement in f-measure of CogNIAC [id] + [3] over the off-the-shelf system is statisti-cally significant. The best overall results regard-ing f-measure are reached if we combine all our extensions of the CogNIAC algorithm. The re-sults of this configuration show that the positive effects of extensions [2] and [3] are complemen-Table 3: Op. Target -Op. Word Pair Extraction tary regarding the extraction of impersonal and demonstrative pronouns. This configuration yields statistically significant improvements regarding f-measure over the off-the-shelf CogNIAC configu-ration, while also having the overall highest recall. 5.1 Error Analysis When extracting opinions from movie reviews, we observe the same challenge as Turney (2002): The users often characterize events in the storyline or roles the characters play. These characterizations contain the same words which are also used to express opinions. Hence these combinations are frequently but falsely extracted as opinion target -opinion word pairs, negatively affecting the precision. The algorithm cannot distinguish them from opinions expressing the stance of the author. Overall, the recall of the baseline is rather low. This is due to the fact that the algorithm only learns a subset of the opinion words and opinion targets annotated in the training data. Currently, it cannot discover any new opinion words and targets. This could be addressed by integrating a component which identifies new opinion targets by calculating the relevance of a word in the corpus based on statistical measures.
 The AR introduces new sources of errors regard-ing the extraction of opinion targets: Errors in gender and number identification can lead to an incorrect selection of antecedent candidates. Even if the gender and number identification is correct, the algorithm might select an incorrect antecedent if there is more than one possible candidate. A non-robust algorithm as CogNIAC might leave a pronoun which is an actual opinion target unresolved, due to the ambiguity of its antecedent candidates.
 The upper bound for the OM with perfect AR on top of the baseline would be recall: 0.649, precision: 0.562, f-measure: 0.602. Our best configuration reaches  X  50% of the improvements which are theoretically possible with perfect AR. We have shown that by extending an OM al-gorithm with AR for opinion target extraction significant improvements can be achieved. The rule based AR algorithm CogNIAC performs well regarding the extraction of opinion targets which are personal pronouns. The algorithm does not yield high precision when resolving impersonal and demonstrative pronouns. We present a set of extensions which address this challenge and in combination yield significant improvements over the off-the-shelf configuration. A robust AR algorithm does not yield any improvements regarding f-measure in the OM task. This type of algorithm creates many false positives, which are not filtered out by the dependency paths employed in the algorithm by Zhuang et al. (2006).
 AR could also be employed in other OM algo-rithms which aim at identifying opinion targets by means of a statistical analysis. Vicedo and Ferr  X  andez (2000) successfully modified the relevance ranking of terms in their documents by replacing anaphora with their antecedents. The approach can be taken for OM algorithms which select the opinion target candidates with a rel-evance ranking (Hu and Liu, 2004; Yi et al., 2003).
