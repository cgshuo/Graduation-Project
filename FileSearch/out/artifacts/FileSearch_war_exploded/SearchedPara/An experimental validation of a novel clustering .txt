 fi 1. Introduction
Hybrid systems are dynamical systems that involve the interac-phases, transitions, computer program codes, etc.

Hybrid systems allow to describe numerous physical processes such as chemical process control where the continuous evolution can be changed by the actuators states (valves and pumps), embedded systems where the discrete part represented by the program interacts with the physical part represented by the air traf fi c management systems, etc. Moreover, the notion of hybrid system can be used to represent complex nonlinear con-strategy which consists in decomposing the domain range of the sidered complex nonlinear system becomes by modeling as an hybrid system switching between linear or af fi ne sub-models.
The analysis and control of hybrid system require that the system's dynamic behavior must be de fi ned by a mathematical model. This model can be developed using the physical laws that the physical laws describing the behavior of the system are not suf fi ciently well known or the system involves not easily measur-able parameters. In addition, it can lead to very complicated models that cause problems of exploitation and implementation. However, for engineering, a mathematical model must provide a compromise between accuracy and simplicity of implementation. A solution to this problem consists in using the identi fi approach which allows building a mathematical model from tion of hybrid systems represented by Piecewise AutoRegressive systems with eXogenous input (PWARX) is considered in this since the PWARX models can approximate any nonlinear system models and other representations of hybrid systems allow to transfer the results of PWA models to other classes of hybrid systems, such as Jump Linear models (JL models) ( Feng et al., 1992 ), Markov Jump Linear models (MJL models) ( Doucet et al., 2001 ), Mixed Logic Dynamical models (MLD models) ( Bemporad systems (MMPS models) ( De Schutter and Van den Boom, 2000 ), Linear Complementarity models (LC models) ( van der Schaft and Schumacher, 1998 ), Extended Linear Complementarity models (ELC models) ( DeSchutter, 1999 ).

The PWARX systems are obtained by decomposing the state-input domain into a fi nite number of nonoverlapping convex polyhedral regions, and by associating a simple linear or af involves both the estimation of the parameters of the af fi an area of research where considerable work has been done in

Regions estimation
The fi nal step consists in determining the regions H i . The methods of statistical learning such as the Support Vector
Machines (SVM) offer an interesting solution to accomplish this task ( Wang, 2005 ; Duda et al., 2001 ). The SVM are a popular 2002 ; Weston and Watkins, 1999 ).

This problem can be easily rewritten as a feasibility problem with linear inequality constraints. The estimated hyperplane separating H i from H j is denoted with M i ; j  X   X  m i ; j m the points in H i belong to the half-space M i ; j  X  r m i ; j inequalities ( Ferrari-Trecate et al., 2003 ):  X  M where Mx r m are the linear inequalities describing the bounded domain H. 4. Chiu's clustering technique
The classi fi cation is an important problem to achieve the ti fi cation of both sub-models and partitions depends on the presents an area of research in which few results have been methods for the identi fi cation of PWARX models are based on of nonlinear criteria. Consequently, they may converge to local performance. Also, most of these algorithms assume that the number of sub-models is a priori known. To overcome these these methods based on the Chui's clustering algorithm. 4.1. Principle point having the highest potential value is chosen as the depends on the minimum value of the potentials or the required number and centers computing.

Potential computing : We consider the local parameters obtained by applying the least square method to the grouping obtained by objective of our proposed classi fi cation technique. Thus, we following expression: P  X   X  N parameter with many neighboring local parameters will have the highest potential value. The constant r a is the radius de neighborhood which can be determined by the following expres-sion: r  X  where  X  can be chosen as follows 0 o  X  o 1.

Outlier processing : From the set of local parameters (  X  1 equation attribute to the outliers a low potential, we can following equation:  X   X  min  X  P  X  X   X   X  max  X  P  X  min  X  P  X  X  ;  X  12  X  where P is the vector containing the potentials P i such that P  X  X  P 1 ; ... ; P N and  X  is a parameter chosen as 0 o  X  o set of local parameters is fi ltered and reduced to (  X  i  X  N with the highest potential value as the fi rst cluster center. P guaranties that these parameters are not selected as cluster that must be chosen larger than r a to avoid obtaining cluster centers which are too close to each other. The constant r computed using this formula: r  X   X

The number of sub-models s is a parameter that we would like to determine. Therefore, we have developed some criteria for algorithm of the next section.

To search the elements belonging to each cluster, we compute the distance between the estimated output and the real one and arg min  X   X  T i  X  k y k  X  ; i  X  1 ; ... ; s :  X  16  X  4.2. Algorithm Algorithm 1. Identi fi cation algorithm

The new clustering technique has several interesting properties which can be summarized as follows: This method automatically generates the number of sub-models. This method does not require the initialization of centers.
Therefore, the problem of convergence towards local minima does not appear.

This method removes the outliers by associating small values to their potentials. This operation improves the performance of the clustering step. 5. Simulation example
We now present an example to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.

Hence, the objective of the simulation is to compare the ef fi ciency of the proposed approach with that of the modi fi ed k-measures are used ( Juloski et al., 2006 ):
The maximum of relative error of parameter vectors is de fi by

Firstly, we determine the local parameters using the least square method with n  X   X  20. The obtained parameter vectors are presented in Fig. 2 .

Secondly, we use the Chui's clustering algorithm in order to that the proposed method is able to remove the outliers. More-symbols.

This section presents an application of the proposed method to added value which is used in fi ne chemical industry such as cosmetic products. 6.1. The semi batch-reactor equation: Acide  X  Alcohol 2 Ester  X  Water :  X  29  X  increased if water is removed from the reaction. The removal of water is achieved by the vaporization technique while avoiding butanol), characterized by a boiling temperature of 118 1 greater than the boiling temperature of the water (close to 100 water may be provided by a temperature slightly greater than 100 1 C.

Reaction stage: The temperature should be kept constant at 105 1 C until the end of the reaction which can be detected by the absence of water at the condenser (when no more water is dripped out of the condenser).

Cooling stage: The reactor's temperature is decreased. 6.2. Existing method for modeling the reactor plant. The heating power P e and the reaction temperature T represent respectively the inpu t and the output of the system. disturbances. In previous work of our laboratory based on some

The obtained system is described by the following discrete transfer function ( Mihoub et al., 2009 ):

A validation experiment of this model is then applied. The obtained results are presented in Fig. 9 which shows that the obtained model generates an estimated output with large error.
These poor results are due to the nonlinearity that charac-terizes the dynamic behavior of the reactor as illustrated in easy to remark that each step of the operating cycle present a linear behavior. Consequently, this reactor can be modeled by a
PWARX model. 6.3. PWARX model for the semi-batch reactor
The alternative of considering a PWA map is very interesting because the characteristic of the system can be considered as piecewise linear in each operating phase: the heating phase, the reacting phase and the cooling phase. Previous works have demonstrated that the adequate estimated orders n a and n can adopt the following structure: y  X  k  X  X  where the regressor vector is de fi ned by  X   X  k  X  X  X  y  X  k 1  X  ; y  X  k 2  X  ; u  X  k 1  X  ; u  X  k 2  X  T and the parameter vectors is denoted by  X  We have picked out some input  X  output measurements from the N  X  220 and another one of length N  X  160 for the validation. to represent the reactor by a PWARX model with a number of neighboring n  X   X  70. Our purpose is to estimate the number of sub-models s , the parameter vectors  X  i  X  k  X  ; i  X  1 ; ... ; hyperplanes de fi ning the partitions f H i g s i  X  1 . The obtained results are as follows: The number of sub-models is s  X  3.

It remains only to determine the partitions f H i g s i  X  1 de fi ned by the following inequalities:

To validate the obtained models, we have considered a new input the best results in terms of precision. 7. Conclusions
