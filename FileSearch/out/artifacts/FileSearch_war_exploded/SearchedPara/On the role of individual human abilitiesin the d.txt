 REGULAR PAPER Elena Zudilova-Seinstra Abstract A scientific problem solving environment should be built in such a way that users (scientists) might exploit underlying technologies without a specialised knowledge about available tools and resources. An adaptive user interface can be considered as an opportunity in addressing this challenge. This paper explores the importance of individual human abilities in the design of adaptive user inter-faces for scientific problem solving environments. In total, seven human factors (gender, learning abilities, locus of control, attention focus, cognitive strategy and verbal and nonverbal IQs) have been evaluated regarding their impact on interface adjustments done manually by users. People X  X  preferences for different interface configurations have been investigated. The experimental study suggests criteria for the inclusion of human factors into the user model guiding and controlling the adaptation process. To provide automatic means of adaptation, the Intelligent System for User Modelling has been developed.
 Keywords Scientific problem solving environments  X  Adaptive user interfaces  X  Human factors  X  Experimental study 1 Introduction A problem solving environment (PSE) is a computer-based interactive framework that combines software and hardware resources to help users in solving a target class of problems [ 18]. Usually, PSEs are tailored to specific application areas. data. It puts the user into an experimental cycle simulated by a computer and let him/her apply expertise to find better solution tothe targeted problem. MATLAB, STATISTICA and RLAB are among the most well-known SPSEs. SPSEs enable users to explore problems in areas as diverse as plasma physics, gas dynamics, cosmology, airshed modelling, etc. Sometimes, SPSEs can also assist in scientific decision making.
 as quickly as possible. The primary SPSE users are domain experts investigating a scientific phenomenon and trying to predict its behaviour. Many are inexperi-enced computer users. Therefore, the SPSE should be built in such a way that the underlying technologies can be exploited by these people without a specialised knowledge of available software and hardware. This can only be achieved if the user X  X  interaction with the data and associated features is apparent. Unfortunately, in reality the situation is far from ideal. To interact with scientific data, users often need to know specific definition languages, be able to run advanced simulation and visualisation routines and utilise software libraries and modules. community [14,18], related research in the field is still focused on technological been sufficiently addressed yet. Both commercial SPSEs and scientific prototypes suffer from usability problems.
 puting environment for numerical computations and visualisations. It supports the data analysis process, starting from acquiring data from external devices and databases, through preprocessing, visualisation and numerical analysis, up to producing presentation-quality output. To enable experts to create their domain specific applications, MATLAB handles a wide variety of interactive tools and command-line based functionality [ 10]. As a result, getting acquainted with this SPSE normally takes a sufficient amount of time.
 Carolina Supercomputing Center for assisting in design and modelling of diverse issues and scales. To model a process, a user first needs to choose simulation vari-ables from a specifically formatted data file and then to link manually input and output of several programs provided by this SPSE. Both procedures require cer-tain expertise from users and can be very time consuming. For instance, according to Fine et al [ 13], a simple air quality study can involve hundreds of program links and variable settings.

 this challenge. If an SPSE is able to adapt to users X  knowledge and skills, tasks and preferences, abilities and disabilities, the efficiency of the user interaction can improve significantly, as well as coverage, reliability and usability of an SPSE in general.
 the role of an adaptation criterion. It consists of human factors guiding and con-trolling the adaptation process. In this research, we have evaluated the influence of selected human factors on different types of interface adjustments performed manually by users of an SPSE. The statistical analysis of experimental data based The experiment has been carried within the Knowledge Engineer X  X  Workbench (KEW). KEW is an SPSE for knowledge acquisition and structuring, which per-mits the recording of interface adjustments. In total, seven human factors from the Wagner X  X  Ergonomic Model [ 41] have been investigated.
 lows. It starts with the overview of related work in the field of adaptive user inter-faces provided in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, an approach to the user model based interface adaptation of an SPSE is introduced. The main human factors from the Wagner X  X  Ergonomic User Model are reviewed in Sect. 4. Sect. 5 presents the user study in-cluding the detailed design description, apparatus and study procedure. In Sect. 6, results of the statistical analysis of experimental data are discussed. The Intelligent System for User Modelling developed to provide automatic means of adaptation for the set of selected human factors is introduced in Sect. 7. The paper concludes with the discussion of design guidelines and plans for future work. 2 Related work From related literature, we know two SPSEs referred to as adaptive: the Adaptive Distributed Virtual Computing Environment [ 21] and the Problem Solving Envi-ronment for Adaptive Engineering Computations [ 28]. However, in both cases the adaptation mechanism deals with the dynamic configuration of the application de-pending on available resources. As for adaptive user interfaces, even though this field has been an active research area for over 10 years, to our knowledge, this solution has never been applied to any existing PSE/SPSE.
 learn and adapt to important user, task and environmental parameters. The most attention to the topic of adaptive interfaces has been gained in Web applications [1] and information systems [ 20]. Also, adaptive user interfaces have shown their promise (supported by experimental studies) in several application areas including recommendation and e-learning systems, content based, social and collaborative information filtering [ 19, 38].
 by the values of variables. Variables from user profiles are the criteria used by the system to trigger and define the adaptation. These variables can be related to the behaviour of the user [ 35], the user X  X  internal physiological state [ 16], user goals [30 ], knowledge [ 15] and personality [ 27].
 models can be classified based on three major points of view: human factors, human X  X omputer interaction and hybrid.
 user X  X  behaviour and psychological state, such as task performance, eye tracking, EEG and even heart rate variability. Among the most important goals of these impairments so that to allow them using a system with the minimal errors and frustration [ 42]. The Closed Loop Adaptive System [ 43] can serve as an example of the human factors based approach. In this system, the automation switch is controlled by a set of decision rules.
 based on a table of variables which categorises the users X  goals and preferences. The user profile is inferred by analysing the user X  X  behaviour, which is mostly restricted to the records of the user X  X  action on the keyboard, mouse or other avail-able input devices. A standard framework for the development of this type of adaptive user interfaces is described by Benyon [2].
 man factors approach with the system-oriented view of the human X  X omputer in-teraction approach. For instance, Brusilovsky and Su [ 5] decompose an adaptive system into two processes. The first process models the user, while the second one relies on the generated user model to provide the basis for adaptation. 3 The user model based interface adaptation of an SPSE The possible architecture of an adaptive SPSE is shown in Fig. 1. It supports the hybrid design approach from Brusilovsky and Su [ 5] and is formed by three ma-jor components: a problem solving framework, an adaptation engine and a data repository. 3.1 Problem solving framework A problem solving framework is a combination of tightly coupled simulation, visualisation and user interaction tools.
 independent data. Generated once, this data does not change. If an SPSE is dy-namic, the interaction between simulation and visualisation compounds is more complicated. Simulated data is generated periodically and visualisations are up-dated with the same frequency. So, the user always deals with the graphical repre-sentation of the simulated data generated at the given time moment.
 parameters can be modified by a user. Also, the user can monitor simulation rou-tines and control the simulation parameters. In some SPSEs, simulation para-meters can be changed by applying methods of interactive visualisation [ 45]. For instance, in a Virtual Radiology Explorer developed at the University of Amster-dam, the user can draw a connection or add a spline object to mimic the surgical operation [ 44]. 3.2 Adaptation engine An adaptation engine consists of three major compounds: a user model generator, a provider of the adaptation effect and a knowledge base.

 of the user. It can include such human factors as the users X  task-related preferences for data visualisations, experience with available simulation and decision support tools and individual psychological and cognitive characteristics.
 The user model is open and can be modified if necessary, e.g. if a new adjustable interface element has been added. This allows to broaden the adaptability of an SPSE without the necessity to restructure the complete adaptation mechanism. model [ 32]) serving for the identification of users. It collects relevant data about a user and saves it in a corresponding profile.
 SPSE should be provided with an interface that suits him or her the best. This can be achieved by assigning individual user accounts (individual interface adaptation [47 ]). Each account corresponds to a user profile configured by a user model ge-nerator. Or, accounts can be also assigned to groups of the SPSE users (stereotype interface adaptation [ 47]), e.g. beginners, intermediate users, experts, etc. forming the adaptation effect. These rules are stored in a knowledge base of an adaptive SPSE.

 these rules are not embedded in the user interface code. For instance, they can be collected as supplementary files, which are consulted by run-time libraries utilised in the development of the SPSE user interface.

The interface parameters that can be adjusted automatically by applying the rule based adaptation mechanism are also called adaptable interface parameters [ 8, 26].

 nality of an SPSE. They may include access settings, system vocabulary, available data representation forms and formats. For instance, certain working processes (simulation, visualisation, configuration routines) can be hidden from the user if his/her knowledge and expertise are insufficient to work with. Also, active controls and menu items can be customised in accordance with the users X  experience and preferences. If the verbal component is important, the linguistic environment of an SPSE can be tuned. This adaptation deals with the vocabulary and morphological structures specific to the problem domain [ 40].
 support. User support [ 7] includes reference information and system feedback. Feedback closes the communication loop between the computer and the user, telling the user that his/her actions have been processed and what the results of those actions are. Invocations of error identifying routines clearly explain the user X  X  mistakes. In the absence of error messages, normal feedback lets the user know that the system is behaving in expected manner. To ensure a good experience, instructions, error notifications, reference information and feedback generated by an SPSE need to be adapted in accordance with knowledge, experience and vocabulary of the current user.

They may include size and appearance of menu items and tool-bars, location and orientation of visualised objects, preferred forms for data rep-resentation, colour palettes, lighting effects, etc. An adaptive interface of an SPSE can remember adjustments of the interface layout parameters made manually by next time, he/she will be provided with exactly the same workspace as during the previous session.
 stored separately, for instance, in the data repository shown in Fig. 1. The SPSE data repository may also contain the user model and profile information, log-data of user X  X omputer interactions, scientific data, etc. The log-data is important for monitoring the user behaviour and preferences. Scientific data is used for con-ducting experiments. 4 Human factors Human factors are individual user characteristics that reflect the relationship be-tween a human and the computer environment. The human factor engineering is the application of knowledge about human capabilities and limitations to a system or equipment design and development to achieve efficient, effective and safe sys-tem performance at minimum cost and manpower, skill and training demands [ 29]. 4.1 The Wagner X  X  Ergonomic Model There have been several attempts made to classify human factors [ 37, 40 , 41]. In this respect, the Wagner X  X  Ergonomic Model [ 41] is the most extensive one. The model consists of 25 groups of 87 human factors.
 human factors combined in seven groups. Each group has different impact on the process of human X  X omputer interaction and its adaptation: 1. Demographic factors (age, gender) do not have direct influence on the pro-2. Psychological communicative factors (locus of control, learning abilities) 3.

Preferences (interface adjustments, specific situations) are usually traced by gonomic conditions of the workspace and has very little relevance to human X  computer interaction. The complete version of the model can be found in Wagner [ 41]. 4.2 The motivation of an experimental study Today X  X  choice of human factors as adaptation criteria depends to a great extent on the application domain of an adaptive system. Among factors most commonly utilised as user variables are those related to people X  X  expertise, motivation and preferences. As for individual human abilities (perceptual and cognitive) and per-sonal user characteristics (psychological and demographic), they have been rarely applied as adaptation criteria. And the main reason for this is uncertainty about their influence on people X  X  preferences for different interface configurations. ence of their individual abilities on the way these people interact with a system. Their computer skills and experience are dominant factors. However, if users are non-computer experts, their expertise is not sufficient enough to predetermine in-terface preferences and therefore the impact of the users X  individual diversity will increase.
 the majority of them are non-computer experts, an SPSE provides nice opportuni-ties for performing an experimental study aimed at investigating existing depen-dencies between personal user characteristics and people X  X  preferences for differ-ent interface adjustments. Moreover, the problem solving process depends heavily on people X  X  cognitive and perceptual abilities [ 34], which can potentially increase the impact of these factors.

 neer X  X  Workbench, which allows recording of interface adjustments. For the eva-luation of human factors, the testing component of the Intelligent System for User Modelling [ 46] has been used. 5.1 The knowledge Engineer X  X  Workbench The Knowledge Engineer X  X  Workbench (KEW) is an SPSE for the knowledge ac-quisition and structuring. It combines tools for performing the conceptual analysis of scientific data when the stages of problem identification and knowledge extrac-tion are passed (see Fig. 3 for a screenshot). Conceptual analysis and knowledge structuring are among the most important stages of the knowledge acquisition process. And there is no doubt that they form the most intellectual part of this pro-cedure. Also, KEW allows the direct accumulation of knowledge obtained from domain experts by translating this knowledge into rules, frames and other textual descriptions. More information about the KEW functionality can be found in refs. [12 , 45].

TECS is part of the Intelligent System for User Mo-delling [ 46]. It provides a rich set of tools for the creation and modification of tests, scales and factor descriptors.

The rest of the factors have been evaluated based on questionnaire forms. 5.3 Participants Fifty-four subjects (23 female, 31 male) participated in the experiment. All subjects were undergraduate MS students attending the project-course  X  X xpert Systems X . At the end of the course, students were expected to develop a know-ledge base for the domain of interest using the KEW system.

During the introduction session, they have been explained how to use conceptual and structuring tools provided by KEW and how to adjust ma-nually the GUI of the system to make the interaction more comfortable. Thanks to individual accounts, the information about interface adjustments made by each subject was collected repeatedly during every lab session. Each subject spent at least 32 h working with the KEW environment: 4 h per week, 8 weeks in total. The last saved interface configurations have been processed.
 Sect. 4.2), subjects also participated in a single 1.5 X 2 h computer testing session. The factors evaluation was performed prior to the actual experimental study car-ried within the KEW system. 5.4 Analysis To analyse the quantitative data, we used the Yule X  X  coefficient of colligation [ 3]. The Yule X  X  coefficient of colligation is the function of two variables. It provides the information about their interrelation within the defined diapason of basic values. coefficient of correlation [ 36] is applied. However, when joint density function is estimated, it is more efficient to use the Yule X  X  coefficient of colligation. tween two random variables x and y can be formulated as follows: where f ( x , y ) is the joint distribution density, f ( x ), f ( y ) X  X arginal distribution densities dent. Otherwise, they are considered dependent. The more coefficients of colliga-tion deviate from 1, the more significant pair dependence is.

The graphical representation of the statistical data is provided in the next section. 6Results &lt;  X  X ccess to working processes X ,  X  X earning abilities X  &gt; and &lt;  X  X ccess to working processes X ,  X  X ttention focus X  &gt; deviate significantly from 1. Thus, for the factor  X  X earning abilities X  C F max = 1 . 49, C F min = 0 . 50 and for the factor  X  X ttention focus X  C F max = 1 . 65, C F min = 0 . 46. These relatively high deviations compared to other factors (see Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix) indicate that individual learning and concentration abilities influence the choice of users for the adjust-ment of the KEW interface parameter  X  X ccess to working processes X .

Also, the discovered dependency between the parameter  X  X ype of dialogue X  and the fac-tor  X  X ocus of control X  does not contradict our expectations about different needs of internal and external users in guidance and support provided by an SPSE. In addition, two unexpected dependencies have been found. According to Fig. 6a and b, adjustments of two functional interface parameters ( X  X ccess to working processes X  and  X  X ype of dialogue X ) are affected by the concentration abilities of users.

However, the hypothesis about the impact of the factor  X  X ognitive strategy X  has not been well significantly from 1, other deviations of the coefficients of colligation calculated Table A3 in the Appendix).

 people X  X  preferences for the adjustments of user support interface parameters have been supported by the experimental data. Unfortunately, the hypotheses about the impact of  X  X ttention focus X  and  X  X ognitive strategy X  have not been supported (see Tables A5 and A6 in the Appendix).

And, according to Fig. 6e, the factor  X  X ocus of control X  affects the user X  X  choice between customised and non-customised interface layouts of an SPSE (colour palette in our experiment). 7 Intelligent System for User Modelling To provide automatic means of adaptation for the set of selected human factors, we developed the Intelligent System for User Modelling (ISUM) [ 46]. 7.1 System architecture ISUM is an instrumental complex aimed at helping developers of adaptive SPSEs in design of the user model based adaptation mechanisms. The system architecture and the dataflow among its main components are shown in Fig. 7. These compo-nents are as follows:  X  Test Creating Shell (TECS)  X  RULLER  X  Main Testing Component (MATEC) 7.2 Knowledge representation The interface adaptation is handled by condition action rules stored as frames in a knowledge base of an SPSE. Frames are structures representing knowledge. Like concepts, in many of the semantic network representations, frames are descrip-tions of objects. The descriptions in a frame are called slots [ 25].

However, if required, the list of adaptable interface parameters can be expanded.

The Default Interface Mode will be assigned to the SPSE users whose profiles do not match any recognition frame from those stored in a knowledge base. that the copy of a knowledge base will be stored at the specified location for the later utilisation by the testing component MATEC. 7.3 Dynamic generation of a Personal Interface Mode MATEC is responsible for the generation of a Personal Interface Mode. This pro-cess comprises five following stages: 1. User testing; 2. Generation of a user profile; 3. Interpretation of a user profile; 4.

It is important to mention that some slots may contain multiple values (e.g.  X  X  + M X  in Fig. 8) meaning that it will be sufficient if the linguistic variable assigned to the factor matches any of the values from the spe-cified range (e.g. in case  X  X  + M X ,  X  X  X  and  X  X  X  are both true values). desired RF frame has been found. When the match is found, the RF frame X  X  name will be used as a criterion to retrieve the related IMF frame from a knowledge base. pectations, we provide the SPSE users with a possibility to control manually the adaptation process. The user can check and edit the automatically configured in-terface mode before it is saved.

In this research, we focused on the user model based interface adaptation. The user model of an SPSE is an abstract representation of the people X  X  relevant properties. It consists of human factors, where each factor re-flects the relationship between a human and an SPSE from a different perspective. most commonly utilised user-related variables in adaptive interface design. As for individual human abilities, they have been rarely applied to the adaptive user inter-action. Meanwhile, taking into account personal user characteristics is essentially important, especially if an adaptive system is oriented to non-computer experts. phenomena and trying to predict their behaviour.

 human factors into the user model of an adaptive SPSE. The diversity in the in-fluence of selected human factors indicates that their applicability as adaptation criteria will depend on adaptable interface parameters supported by the SPSE. For instance, functional and user support interface parameters will be affected by psy-chological and psychomotor factors the most. As for cognitive factors, they will have an effect on the user support and interface layout.

The system provides tools for building the testing component of an adaptive SPSE and acquisition and structuring tools for the development of the SPSE knowledge base. The frame approach has been chosen to represent the adaptation rules.

The interactive image based exploration of vascular disorders will serve as the case study for the further research. Appendix: statistical evaluation of experimental data References Biography
