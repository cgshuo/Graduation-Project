This prototype demo nstrat e a novel met hod for lear n ing to find tran sliterat ions of proper nouns on the Web based on query expansion aimed at max imi zing the probability of ret rieving tran sli t-erat ions fro m existing search e n gines. Since the met hod we used involves learn ing the mo rpholog i-cal relationships between names and their transli t-erat ions, we refer to this IR -based approach as morphological query expansion for machine tran s-liter a tion . The morphological query expansion approach is ge n eral in scope and can be applied to tran slation and tran s literat ion, but we focus on tran sliter a tion in this paper.

Man y texts containing proper names (e.g.,  X  The cities of Mes opotami a prospered under Part hian and Sa s sanian rule.  X ) are submi tted to mach ine tran slation ser v ices on the Web every day, and there are also serv ice on the Web speci fically ta r-get tran sliterat ion of proper names , including CHIN ET (Kwok et al. 2005) ad Livet rans (Lu, Ch ien, and Lee 2004).
 Mach ine tran slation systems on the Web such as Ya hoo Translate ( babelfish.yahoo.com ) and Go o-gle Translate ( translate.google.com/tran s late_t .g) typical ly use a bilingual dictionary that is either man ually comp iled or learn ed from a parallel co r-pus. However , such dictionari es often have insuff i-cient coverage of proper names and tec h nical terms , lead ing to poor tran slation due to out of v o-cab ulary problem . The OOV problems of mach ine tran slation or cro ss language informat ion retrieval can be handled mo re effe ctively by learning to find tran sli t erat ion on the Web. 
Co nsider Sentence 1 containing three place names . Google Translate pr o duce Sen tence 2, leav ing  X  X art hian X  and  X  X as sanian X  not translated. A good r e sponse mi ght be a translation like Sen tence 3 where all place nam es have appropriate transliter a-tions (u nderl ined). These tran sliterat ions can be mo re eff ect ively ret rieved fro m mi xed code Web pages by e x tend each of the place names into a query (e. g.,  X  X a r thian NEAR  X   X ). Intuitively by req uiring one of likely prefi x tran sliterat ion mo r-phemes (e.g.,  X   X   X  or  X   X   X  for  X  X ar - X  names ), we can bias the sear ch engine toward s ret rie v ing the correct transliter a tions (e. g.,  X   X  X  X  X   X  and  X   X  X  X   X   X ) in snippets of man y top -ran ked doc u ments. 
The method involves pairing up the pr e fixing mo rphemes between name and transliter a tion i n a set of trai n data, cal culating the statistical associ a-tion for these pair, and select ing pairs with a high d e gree of statistical association. The results of this trai ning stage are mo rphological rel ationships b e-tween prefi xes and postfixes of names and transli t-erat ions. At run time , a given name is automat i-cal ly extended into a query with rel evant prefixing mo r phemes , then the query is submi t to some search engine. After r e trieving snippets fro m a search engine, the system e x tract tran sliterat ions fro m the snippets based on red undancy, proximi ty between name and tran sliterat ion, and cro ss la n-guage mo rphological rel a tionships of prefi x and postfix.

We pres ent a new mach ine tran sliterat ion sy s-tem based on informat ion ret rieval and mo rph o-logical query expan sion. The system automat i cal ly learn s to extend the proper nam es into a query e x-pect ed to ret rieve and extract tran sliter a tions of the proper names . Co nsider the cas e of transliterat ion of  X  X a rthian. X  The system looks at possible pr e-fixes of the given name , including p -, pa -, par -, and part -, and determi ne determi nes the best n query expansions (e.g.,  X  X a r thian  X  , X   X  X  art hian  X   X ). These effe ctive expansions automat ical ly du r-ing trai ning by analyzing a co l lect ion of 23,615 place names and transliterat ions pai rs. 
We evaluated the prototype system using a list of 500 proper names . The results show that 60% of the time there are sufficient rel evant data on the Web to car ry out eff ect ive ma chine transliterat ion based on IR and mo rphological query expansion. Of ma ny res ults returned by the system , the top 1, two and three res ults are 0. 88, 0.93, and 0.94. By perfo rmi ng query expansion, the system imp roves the rec all rat e fro m 0.48 to 0.60.

The res ults indicat e that mo st names and tran s-literat ion counterp art s can of ten be found on the Web and the proposed met hod are very effect ive in ret rieving and e x tract i ng tran sliterat ions based on a statistical mach ine tran sliterat ion mo del trai ned on a bilingual name list. Our demo nstrat ion prototype shows altern ative transli t e rat ions in use on the Web and snippets of such usage, so that the user can easily validate these tran sliterat ions. 
The prototype supports:  X  Sear ching and extract ing tran sliterat ions of a  X  Listing altern ative tran sliterat ions on the  X  Listing al tern ative tran sliterat ion in a local  X  Bro wsing of snippets containing for each a l- X  Sav ing tran sliterat ions in a local dictionary  X  Sel ect ing and saving tran sliterat ion in sni p-
The met hod explored he re can be extended as an alterat ive way to support such MT su b tasks as back tran sli t erat ion (K night and Graeh l 1998) and noun phras e tran slation (Koehn and Knight 2003). F i-nally, for mo re challenging tasks, such as handling sentences , the imp rovemen t of tr anslation quality probably will also be ach ieved by comb ining this IR -based approach and statistical ma chine transl a-tion. Fo r examp le, a prep rocessing unit may r e-place the proper nam es in a sentence with transli t-erat ions (e.g., mi xed code text such as Sen t ence 4) on the fly or by looking up a local dictionary befo re sen d ing it off to MT for finally translation.
Morphological query exp ansion rep res ents an innovative way to cap ture cro ss -linguistic rel ations in name tran sliterat ion. The met hod is independent of the bilingual lexicon content mak ing it eas y to adopt to other pr oper names such pers on, product, or organization nam es. This approach is usefu l in a numb er of ma chine transl a tion subtasks, including name transliterat ion, back transliterat ion, named entity tran slation, and term i nology tran slation.
