 Big Data is a new term used to identify the datasets that due to their large size and complexity, we can not manage them with our current methodologies or data mining soft-ware tools. Big Data mining is the capability of extracting useful information from these large datasets or streams of data, that due to its volume, variability, and velocity, it was not possible before to do it. The Big Data challenge is becoming one of the most exciting opportunities for the next years. We present in this issue, a broad overview of the topic, its current status, controversy, and forecast to the future. We introduce four articles, written by influen-tial scientists in the field, covering the most interesting and state-of-the-art topics on Big Data mining. Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in our abil-ity to collect data from various sensors, devices, in different formats, from independent or connected applications. This data flood has outpaced our capability to process, analyze, store and understand these datasets. Consider the Internet data. The web pages indexed by Google were around one million in 1998, but quickly reached 1 billion in 2000 and have already exceeded 1 trillion in 2008. This rapid expan-sion is accelerated by the dramatic increase in acceptance of social networking applications, such as Facebook, Twitter, Weibo, etc., that allow users to create contents freely and amplify the already huge Web volume. Furthermore, with mobile phones becoming the sensory gateway to get real-time data on people from different aspects, the vast amount of data that mobile carrier can potentially process to im-prove our daily life has significantly outpaced our past CDR (call data record)-based processing for billing purposes only. It can be foreseen that Internet of things (IoT) applications will raise the scale of data to an unprecedented level. People and devices (from home coffee machines to cars, to buses, railway stations and airports) are all loosely connected. Tril-lions of such connected components will generate a huge data ocean, and valuable information must be discovered from the data to help improve quality of life and make our world a better place. For example, after we get up every morning, in order to optimize our commute time to work and complete the optimization before we arrive at office, the system needs to process information from traffic, weather, construction, police activities to our calendar schedules, and perform deep optimization under the tight time constraints. In all these applications, we are facing significant challenges in leveraging the vast amount of data, including challenges in (1) system capabilities (2) algorithmic design (3) business models.
 As an example of the interest that Big Data is having in the data mining community, the grand theme of this year X  X  KDD conference was  X  X ining the Big Data X  . Also there was a specific workshop BigMine X 12 in that topic: 1st Interna-tional Workshop on Big Data, Streams and Heterogeneous Source Mining: Algorithms, Systems, Programming Mod-els and Applications 1 . Both events successfully brought to-gether people from both academia and industry to present their most recent work related to these Big Data issues, and exchange ideas and thoughts. These events are important in order to advance this Big Data challenge, which is being considered as one of the most exciting opportunities in the years to come.
 We introduce Big Data mining and its applications in Sec-tion 2. We summarize the papers presented in this issue in Section 3, and discuss about Big Data controversy in Sec-tion 4. We point the importance of open-source software tools in Section 5 and give some challenges and forecast to the future in Section 6. Finally, we give some conclusions in Section 7. The term  X  X ig Data X  appeared for first time in 1998 in a Silicon Graphics (SGI) slide deck by John Mashey with the title of  X  X ig Data and the Next Wave of InfraStress X  [9]. Big Data mining was very relevant from the beginning, as the first book mentioning  X  X ig Data X  is a data mining book that appeared also in 1998 by Weiss and Indrukya [34] . However, the first academic paper with the words  X  X ig Data X  in the title appeared a bit later in 2000 in a paper by Diebold [8]. The origin of the term  X  X ig Data X  is due to the fact that we are creating a huge amount of data every day. Usama Fayyad [11] in his invited talk at the KDD BigMine X 12 Work-shop presented amazing data numbers about internet usage, among them the following: each day Google has more than 1 billion queries per day, Twitter has more than 250 milion tweets per day, Facebook has more than 800 million updates per day, and YouTube has more than 4 billion views per day. The data produced nowadays is estimated in the order of zettabytes, and it is growing around 40% every year. A http://big-data-mining.org/ new large source of data is going to be generated from mobile devices, and big companies as Google, Apple, Facebook, Ya-hoo, Twitter are starting to look carefully to this data to find useful patterns to improve user experience. Alex  X  X andy X  Pentland in his  X  X uman Dynamics Laboratory X  at MIT, is doing research in finding patterns in mobile data about what users do, and not in what people says they do [28]. We need new algorithms, and new tools to deal with all of this data. Doug Laney[19] was the first one in talking about 3 V X  X  in Big Data management:  X  Volume: there is more data than ever before, its size continues increasing, but not the percent of data that our tools can process  X  Variety: there are many different types of data, as text, sensor data, audio, video, graph, and more  X  Velocity: data is arriving continuously as streams of data, and we are interested in obtaining useful infor-mation from it in real time Nowadays, there are two more V X  X :  X  Variability: there are changes in the structure of the data and how users want to interpret that data  X  Value: business value that gives organization a com-pelling advantage, due to the ability of making deci-sions based in answering questions that were previ-ously considered beyond reach Gartner[15] summarizes this in their definition of Big Data in 2012 as high volume, velocity and variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of infor-mation processing for enhanced insight and decision making. There are many applications of Big Data, for example the following [17; 2]:  X  Business: costumer personalization, churn detection  X  Technology: reducing process time from hours to sec-onds  X  Health: mining DNA of each person, to discover, mon-itor and improve health aspects of every one  X  Smart cities: cities focused on sustainable economic development and high quality of life, with wise man-agement of natural resources These applications will allow people to have better services, better costumer experiences, and also be healthier, as per-sonal data will permit to prevent and detect illness much earlier than before [17]. To show the usefulness of Big Data mining, we would like to mention the work that Global Pulse is doing [33] using Big Data to improve life in developing countries. Global Pulse is a United Nations initiative, launched in 2009, that functions as an innovative lab, and that is based in mining Big Data for developing countries. They pursue a strategy that consists of 1) researching innovative methods and tech-niques for analyzing real-time digital data to detect early emerging vulnerabilities; 2) assembling free and open source technology toolkit for analyzing real-time data and sharing hypotheses; and 3) establishing an integrated, global net-work of Pulse Labs, to pilot the approach at country level. Global Pulse describe the main opportunities Big Data offers to developing countries in their White paper  X  X ig Data for Development: Challenges &amp; Opportunities X  X 22]: The Big Data mining revolution is not restricted to the in-dustrialized world, as mobiles are spreading in developing countries as well. It is estimated than there are over five billion mobile phones, and that 80% are located in develop-ing countries. We selected four contributions that together shows very sig-nificant state-of-the-art research in Big Data Mining, and that provides a broad overview of the field and its forecast to the future. Other significant work in Big Data Mining can be found in the main conferences as KDD, ICDM, ECML-PKDD, or journals as  X  X ata Mining and Knowledge Discov-ery X  or  X  X achine Learning X . -Scaling Big Data Mining Infrastructure: The Twit-ter Experience by Jimmy Lin and Dmitriy Ryaboy (Twit-ter,Inc.) . This paper presents insights about Big Data min-ing infrastructures, and the experience of doing analytics at Twitter. It shows that due to the current state of the data mining tools, it is not straightforward to perform analytics. Most of the time is consumed in preparatory work to the ap-plication of data mining methods, and turning preliminary models into robust solutions. -Mining Heterogeneous Information Networks: A Structural Analysis Approach by Yizhou Sun (North-eastern University) and Jiawei Han (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) . This paper shows that mining het-erogeneous information networks is a new and promising research frontier in Big Data mining research. It considers interconnected, multi-typed data, including the typical re-lational database data, as heterogeneous information net-works. These semi-structured heterogeneous information network models leverage the rich semantics of typed nodes and links in a network and can uncover surprisingly rich knowledge from interconnected data. -Big Graph Mining: Algorithms and discoveries by U Kang and Christos Faloutsos(Carnegie Mellon Universi-tiy) . This paper presents an overview of mining big graphs, focusing in the use of the Pegasus tool, showing some find-ings in the Web Graph and Twitter social network. The paper gives inspirational future research directions for big graph mining. -Mining Large Streams of User Data for Personal-ized Recommendations by Xavier Amatriain (Netflix) . This paper presents some lessons learned with the Netflix Prize, and discuss the recommender and personalization tech-niques used in Netflix. It discusses recent important prob-lems and future research directions. Section 4 contains an interesting discussion about if we need more data or better models to improve our learning methodology. As Big Data is a new hot topic, there have been a lot of con-troversy about it, for example see [7]. We try to summarize it as follows:  X  There is no need to distinguish Big Data analytics from data analytics, as data will continue growing, and it will never be small again.  X  Big Data may be a hype to sell Hadoop based comput-ing systems. Hadoop is not always the best tool [23]. It seems that data management system sellers try to sell systems based in Hadoop, and MapReduce may be not always the best programming platform, for exam-ple for medium-size companies.  X  In real time analytics, data may be changing. In that case, what it is important is not the size of the data, it is its recency.  X  Claims to accuracy are misleading. As Taleb explains in his new book [32], when the number of variables grow, the number of fake correlations also grow. For example, Leinweber [21] showed that the S&amp;P 500 stock index was correlated with butter production in Bangladesh, and other funny correlations.  X  Bigger data are not always better data. It depends if the data is noisy or not, and if it is representative of what we are looking for. For example, some times Twitter users are assumed to be a representative of the global population, when this is not always the case.  X  Ethical concerns about accessibility. The main issue is if it is ethical that people can be analyzed without knowing it.  X  Limited access to Big Data creates new digital divides. There may be a digital divide between people or orga-nizations being able to analyze Big Data or not. Also organizations with access to Big Data will be able to extract knowledge that without this Big Data is not possible to get. We may create a division between Big Data rich and poor organizations. The Big Data phenomenon is intrinsically related to the open source software revolution. Large companies as Face-book, Yahoo!, Twitter, LinkedIn benefit and contribute work-ing on open source projects. Big Data infrastructure deals with Hadoop, and other related software as:  X  Apache Hadoop [3]: software for data-intensive dis-tributed applications, based in the MapReduce pro-gramming model and a distributed file system called Hadoop Distributed Filesystem (HDFS). Hadoop al-lows writing applications that rapidly process large In Big Data Mining, there are many open source initiatives. The most popular are the following: More specific to Big Graph mining we found the following open source tools:  X  GraphLab [24]: high-level graph-parallel system built without using MapReduce . GraphLab computes over dependent records which are stored as vertices in a large distributed data-graph. Algorithms in GraphLab are expressed as vertex-programs which are executed in parallel on each vertex and can interact with neigh-boring vertices. There are many future important challenges in Big Data management and analytics, that arise from the nature of data: large, diverse, and evolving [27; 16]. These are some of the challenges that researchers and practitioners will have to deal during the next years:  X  Analytics Architecture. It is not clear yet how an op-timal architecture of an analytics systems should be to deal with historic data and with real-time data at the same time. An interesting proposal is the Lambda architecture of Nathan Marz [25]. The Lambda Ar-chitecture solves the problem of computing arbitrary functions on arbitrary data in realtime by decompos-ing the problem into three layers: the batch layer, the serving layer, and the speed layer. It combines in the same system Hadoop for the batch layer, and Storm for the speed layer. The properties of the system are: robust and fault tolerant, scalable, general, extensi-ble, allows ad hoc queries, minimal maintenance, and debuggable.  X  Statistical significance. It is important to achieve sig-nificant statistical results, and not be fooled by ran-domness. As Efron explains in his book about Large Scale Inference [10], it is easy to go wrong with huge data sets and thousands of questions to answer at once.  X  Distributed mining. Many data mining techniques are not trivial to paralyze. To have distributed versions of some methods, a lot of research is needed with practi-cal and theoretical analysis to provide new methods.  X  Time evolving data. Data may be evolving over time, so it is important that the Big Data mining techniques should be able to adapt and in some cases to detect change first. For example, the data stream mining field has very powerful techniques for this task [13].  X  Compression: Dealing with Big Data, the quantity of space needed to store it is very relevant. There are two main approaches: compression where we don X  X  loose anything, or sampling where we choose what is the data that is more representative. Using compression, we may take more time and less space, so we can con-sider it as a transformation from time to space. Using sampling, we are loosing information, but the gains in space may be in orders of magnitude. For example Feldman et al. [12] use coresets to reduce the com-plexity of Big Data problems. Coresets are small sets that provably approximate the original data for a given problem. Using merge-reduce the small sets can then be used for solving hard machine learning problems in parallel.  X  Visualization. A main task of Big Data analysis is how to visualize the results. As the data is so big, it is very Big Data is going to continue growing during the next years, and each data scientist will have to manage much more amount of data every year. This data is going to be more diverse, larger, and faster. We discussed in this paper some insights about the topic, and what we consider are the main concerns, and the main challenges for the future. Big Data is becoming the new Final Frontier for scientific data research and for business applications. We are at the beginning of a new era where Big Data mining will help us to discover knowledge that no one has discovered before. Everybody is warmly invited to participate in this intrepid journey.
