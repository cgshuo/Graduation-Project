 Expert retrieval has been widely studied especially after the introduction of Expert Finding task in the TREC X  X  Enter-prise Track in 2005 [3]. This track provided two differ-ent test collections crawled from two organizations X  public-facing websites and internal emails which led to the develop-ment of many state-of-the-art algorithms on expert retrieval [1]. Until recently, these datasets were considered good rep-resentatives of the information resources available within en-terprise. However, the recent growth of social media also in-fluenced the work environment, and social media became a common communication and collaboration tool within orga-nizations. According to a recent survey by McKinsey Global Institute [2], 29% of the companies use at least one social media tool for matching their employees to tasks, and 26% of them assess their employees X  performance by using social media. This shows that intra-organizational social media became an important resource to identify expertise within organizations.

In recent years, in addition to the intra-organizational so-cial media, public social media tools like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn also became common environments for searching expertise. These tools provide an opportunity for their users to show their specific skills to the world which motivates re-cruiters to look for talented job candidates on social media, or writers and reporters to find experts for consulting on specific topics they are working on. With these motivations in mind, in this work we propose to develop expert retrieval algorithms for intra-organizational and public social media tools.

Social media datasets have both challenges and advan-tages. In terms of challenges, they do not always contain context on one specific domain, instead one social media tool may contain discussions on technical stuff, hobbies or news concurrently. They may also contain spam posts or advertisements. Compared to well-edited enterprise docu-ments, they are much more informal in language. Further-more, depending on the social media platform, they may have limits on the number of characters used in posts. Even though they include the challenges stated above, they also bring some unique authority signals, such as votes, com-ments, follower/following information, which can be useful in estimating expertise. Furthermore, compared to previ-ously used enterprise documents, social media provides clear associations between documents and candidates in the con-text of authorship information. In this work, we propose to develop expert retrieval approaches which will handle these challenges while making use of the advantages.

Expert retrieval is a very useful application by itself; fur-thermore, it can be a step towards improving other social media applications. Social media is different than other web based tools mainly because it is dependent on its users. In social media, users are not just content consumers, but they are also the primary and sometimes the only content cre-ators. Therefore, the quality of any user-generated content in social media depends on its creator. In this thesis, we propose to use expertise of users in order to improve the ex-isting applications so that they can estimate the relevancy of a content not just based on the content, but also based on the expertise of the content creator. By using expertise of the content generator, we also hope to boost contents that are more reliable. We propose to apply this user X  X  expertise information in order to improve ad-hoc search and question answering applications in social media. In this work, previ-ous TREC enterprise datasets, available intra-organizational social media and public social media datasets will be used to test the proposed algorithms.
