 Many data mining techniques have been proposed for min-ing useful patterns in databases. However, how to effec-tively utilize discovered patterns is still an open research is-sue, especially in the domain of text mining. Most existing methods adopt term-based approaches. However, they all suffer from the problems of polysemy and synonymy. This paper presents an innovative technique, pattern taxonomy mining, to improve the effectiveness of using discovered pat-terns for finding useful information. Substantial experiments on RCV1 demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves encouraging performance.

Text mining is the discovery of knowledge in text docu-ments. It is a challenging issue to find accurate knowledge in text documents to help users to find what they want. In the beginning, Information Retrieval (IR) provided many term-based methods to solve this challenge, such as Rocchio and probabilistic models [1], rough set models [5], BM25 and SVM [9] based filtering models. However, term-based meth-ods suffer from the problems of polysemy and synonymy. Over the years, people have often held the hypothesis that phrase-based approaches should perform better than the term-based ones, as phrases are more discriminative and arguably carrying more  X  X emantics X . This hypothesis has not fared too well in the history of IR [10]. Towards this direction, pattern-based approach PTM [12, 11] has been proposed, which adopts the concepts of closed patterns, and pruns non-closed patterns. This paper presents the tech-nique of inner pattern evolution used in PTM, which con-siders the influence of patterns from negative training ex-amples in finding ambiguous patterns and reducing their impact. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Sec-tion 2 discusses the related works. Section 3 proposes the technique of inner pattern evolution in PTM. Following is the discussion of experimental setting and results. Finally, Section 5 concludes this study work.
Pattern mining has been extensively studied in data min-ing communities for many years. These research works have mainly focused on developing efficient mining algorithms for discovering patterns from a larger data collection. However, searching for useful and interesting patterns and rules is still an open problem [6, 4, 13]. Moreover, the challenging issue is how to effectively deal with the large amount of discovered patterns. For this issue, we have used closed sequential pat-terns for text mining in [12], where we have firstly verified that the concepts of closed patterns in text mining were sig-nificant. We also proposed pattern taxonomy model in [11] to improve the effectiveness of using closed patterns in text mining. Also, pattern evolution technique was introduced in [7] in order to improve the performance of ontology mining.
Considering the influence of patterns from negative train-ing examples, we re-shuffle supports of terms within normal forms of d-patterns N DP [7] based on negative documents in a training set. This technique is called Inner Pattern Evolu-tion (IPE), since it only changes a pattern X  X  term supports within the pattern. A threshold is usually used to decide the relevance of incoming documents. A noise negative doc-ument nd in a set of negative documents D  X  is a negative document that the system falsely identified as a positive. In order to reduce the noise, we need to track which d-patterns have been used to give rise to such error. We call these patterns  X  X ffenders of nd  X . Two types of offenders are de-fined: (1) a complete conflict offender which is a subset of nd ; and (2) a partial conflict offender which contains a part of terms of nd . The basic idea of updating patterns is to remove complete conflict offenders from d-patterns firstly. For partial conflict offenders, we re-shuffle their term sup-ports in order to reduce the effects of noise documents. The main process of inner pattern evolution is implemented by the algorithm IPEvolving (see Algorithm 1).

The pattern composition operation  X  in Step (6) is used to compose updated normal forms together and is defined in [11]. The task of Re-Shuffling is to tune the support Method top-20 b/p MAP F  X  =1 IAP PTM(IPE) 0.493 0.429 0.441 0.440 0.466 Sequential ptns 0.401 0.343 0.361 0.385 0.384 Freq. itemsets 0.412 0.352 0.361 0.386 0.384 Rocchio 0.416 0.392 0.391 0.408 0.418 Prob 0.407 0.381 0.379 0.396 0.402 TFIDF 0.321 0.321 0.322 0.355 0.348 BM25 0.434 0.399 0.401 0.410 0.422 SVM 0.447 0.409 0.408 0.421 0.434 Table 1: Comparison of all methods on the first 50 topics. distribution of terms within a d-pattern. As a result, the complete conflict offenders (d-patterns) are removed since all elements within the d-patterns are held by the negative documents indicating that they can be discarded for pre-venting interference from these possible  X  X oises X .
In this study we use Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) text collection to evaluate the proposed approach. For di-mensionality reduction, stopword removal is applied and Porter algorithm [8] is selected for suffix stripping. Terms with term frequency equaling to one are discarded. Sev-eral standard measures based on precision and recall are used. The precision of first K returned documents top-K is also adopted in this paper. The value of K we use in the experiments is 20. In addition, breakeven point ( b/p ), F measure [3], Interpolated Average Precision (IAP) [2] and Mean Average Precision (MAP) are also used for perfor-mance evaluation.

The results of overall comparisons are presented in Ta-ble 1. The proposed approach PTM(IPE) archives an out-standing performance for text mining by comparing with the up-to-date pattern mining-based methods and the well-known term-based methods, including the state-of-the-art BM25 and SVM [9] models. The promising results can be explained in that the use of pattern taxonomies in PTM integrates well with the advantages of terms and phrases. Moreover, the inner pattern evolution strategy provides an effective evaluation for estimating each term X  X  significance in the hypothesis space based on not only the term X  X  statistical properties but also the pattern X  X  associations in the pattern taxonomies.
Many data mining techniques have been proposed in the last decade, including association rule mining, frequent item-set mining, sequential pattern mining and closed pattern mining. However, utilizing the discovered knowledge (or patterns) is difficult and ineffective. The reason is that a useful long pattern is of high specificity but short in support. However, not all frequent short patterns are useful. Hence, inadequate use of patterns derived from data mining tech-niques leads to the ineffective performance. In this research work, an effective pattern taxonomy mining model has been proposed, aiming to overcome the aforementioned problem. The experimental results show that the proposed model out-performs not only other pure pattern mining-based methods, but also term-based models including the state-of-the-art BM25 and SVM. [1] R.
