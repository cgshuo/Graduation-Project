Many of t he most glaring errors made by t o-day X  X  statistical machine translation systems are those r e sulting from confusion of s emantic roles. T ranslation errors of this type frequently result in critical mi s understandings of the essential meaning of the original input language sentences  X  who did what to whom, for whom or what, how, where, when, and why.

Semantic role confusions are errors of adequacy rather than fluency. It has often been no ted that the dom i nance of lexically -oriented, precision -based metrics such as BLEU ( Papineni et al. 2002 ) tend to reward fluency more than ad e quacy. The length penalty in the BLEU metric, in partic u lar, is only an indirect and weak indicator of ad e quacy. As a result, SMT work has been driven to optimize sy s tems such that they often produce translations that contain significant role confusion errors d e-spite reading fl u ently.

The present work is inspired by the question of whether we can improve translation utility via a strategy of f a voring semantic adequacy slightly more  X  possibly at the expense of slight degrad a-tions in lexical fl u ency.

Shallow semantic parsing models have attained increasing levels of accuracy in recent years (Gildea and Jurafsky 2000; Sun and Jurafsky 2004; Pradhan et al. 2004, 2005; Pradhan 2005; Fung et al. 2006, 2007; Gim X nez and M X rquez 2007a, 2008 ). Such models, which identify semantic frames within input sentences by marking its predicates, and labeling their arg u ments with the s emantic roles that they fill.

Evidence has begun to accumulate that semantic frames  X  predicates and semantic roles  X  tend to preserve consistency across translations better than syntactic roles do. This is, of course, by d e sign; it follows from the defin ition of semantic roles, which are less language -dependent than sy n tactic roles. Across Chinese and English, for e x ample, it has been reported that approximately 84% of s e-mantic roles are preserved consistently (Fung et al. 2006). Of these, roughly 15% d o not preserve sy n-tactic roles consistently.
 ing semantic correctness, we believe that the ad e-quacy of MT output could be improved by leveraging the predictions of semantic parsers. We would like to exploit automatic semantic parsers to identify inconsistent semantic frame and role ma p-pings between the input source se n tences and their output transl a tions.

However, we take note of the difficult exper i-ence in making syntactic and semantic models co n-tribute to i m proving SMT accuracy. On the one hand, there is reason to be optimistic. Over the past decade, we have seen an accumulation of ev i-dence that SMT accuracy can be i m proved via tree -structured and syntactic models (e.g., Wu 1997; Wu and Chiang 2009), and m ore recently, work from lex i cal semantics has also at long last been successfully applied to increasing SMT acc u-racy, in the form of techniques adapted from word sense di s ambiguation models ( Chan et al. 2007; Gim  X  nez and M X rquez 2007 b; Carpuat and Wu 2007 ). On the other hand, both directions saw u n-expected di s appointments along the way (e.g., Och et al. 2003; Carpuat and Wu 2005). We are ther e-fore for e warned that it is likely to be at least as difficult to successfully adapt the even more co m-plex types of lexical semantics modeling from s e-mantic parsing and role labeling to the transl a tion task.

In this paper, we present a novel hybrid model that, for the first time to our knowledge, succes s-fully applies semantic parsing tec h nology to the cha l lenge of impr oving the quality of Chinese -English stati s tical machine translation. The model makes use of a typical re p resentative SMT system based on Moses, plus shallow sema n tic parsers for both English and Chinese. While the accuracy of shallow semantic parsers has been approaching reasonably high levels in recent years for well -studied languages like En g-lish, and to a lesser extent, Chinese, the problem of e x cessive computational complexity is one of the pr i mary challenges in adapting s emantic parsing technology to the tran s lation task.

Moreover, the sema n tic parses are less likely to share an exactly isomo r-phic s tructure across the input and output la n-guages, since the raison d X  X  X re of semantic par s ing is to capture semantic frame and role regular i ties independent of syntactic variation  X  monolingually and cross -lingually.
 parsing into SMT merely by applying the sort of dynamic programming tec h niques found in current syntactic and tree -structured SMT mo d els, most of which rely on being able to factor the computation into ind e pendent computations on the subtrees. In o ther words, the key computational obstacle is that the semantic parse of a larger string (or string pair, in the case of translation) is not in general strictly mechanically composable from the semantic parses of its smaller substrings (or su b string pairs) . reason that today X  X  most accurate shallow semantic par s ers rely not primarily on compositional parsing techniques, but rather on ensembles of pr e dictors that independently rate/rank a wide variety of fa c-t ors supporting the role assignments given a broad sentence -wide range of context fe a tures. But while this improves semantic parsing accuracy, it poses a major obstacle for efficient tight integration into the sub -hypothesis construction and maintenance lo ops within SMT d e coders.
 hybrid two -pass model defers application of the non -compositional semantic parsing information until a second error -correcting pass. This imposes a division of labor between the two p asses. phrase -based SMT model. The phrase -based SMT model is assigned to the tasks of (a) pr o viding an initial baseline hypothesis translation, and (b) fi x-ing the lexical choice decisions. Note that the lex i-cal choice decisions are not on ly at the si n gle -word level, but are in general at the phrasal level. pass, and re -orders constituent phrases correspon d-ing to semantic predicates and arguments, seeking to maximize the cross -lingual match of t he sema n-tic parse of the re -ordered translation to that of the original input sentence. The second pass alg o rithm performs the error co r rection shown in Figure 1. all lexical choices follows an insight in spired by an e m pirical observation from our error analyses: the lex i cal choice decisions being made by today X  X  SMT mo d els have attained fairly reasonable levels, and are not where the m a jor problems of adequacy lie. Rather, the ordering of arguments in r elation to their pred i cates is often where the main failures of adequacy occur. By avoiding lexical choice variations while considering re -ordering hypoth e-ses, a significantly la r ger amount of re -ordering can be done without further increasing comput a-tion al complexity. So we sacrifice a small amount of fluency by allowing re -ordering without co m-pensating lexical choice  X  in exchange for gaining p o tentially a larger amount of fluency by getting the predicate -argument stru c ture right.

Oracle analysis of n -best lists and la t-tices show that they often focus on lexical choice a l ternatives rather than re -ordering / role variations which are more im po r tant to semantic adequacy. on the two -pass hybrid model. A phrase -based SMT baseline model was built by au g menting the open source statistical machine tran s lation decoder Moses (Koehn et al. 2007) wi th additional pr e-processors.

The second pass ends up re -ordering the constituent phrase corresponding to the mi s-matched ARGM -LOC, of Japan in the capital market , to follow the PRED i s sued , where the new English semantic parse now assigns most of its words the correctly matched ARGM -LOC sema n-tic role l a bel. Similarly, samurai bonds 30 billion yen is re -ordered to 30 billion yen samurai bonds . To our knowledge, this is a first result demonstra t-ing that shallow semantic parsing can improve translation accuracy of SMT models. We note that a c curacy here was measured via BLEU, and it has been widely observed that the negative i m pacts of semantic predicate -argument errors on the utility of the translation are underestimated by eval uation me t rics based on lexical criteria such as BLEU. We conjecture that more expensive manual evalu a-tion techniques which directly measure translation utility could even more strongly reveal improv e-ment in role confusion errors.
 with the greedy re -ordering based strategy of the ReWrite decoder (Germann et al. 2001), a l though our search is breadth -first rather than purely greedy. Whereas ReWrite was based on word -level re -ordering, however, our approach is base d on co n stituent phrase re -ordering, and the phrases to be re -ordered are more selectively ch o sen via the s e mantic parse labels. Moreover, the objective fun c tion being maximized by ReWrite is still the SMT model score; whereas in our case the new objectiv e function is cross -lingual semantic pred i-cate -argument match (plus an implicit search bias t o ward fewer re -orderings).

The hybrid two -pass approach can also be co m-pared with serial combination architectures for h y-brid MT (e.g., Ueffing et al. 2008). But whereas Ueffing et al. take the ou t put from a first -pass rule -based MT system, and then correct it using a se c-ond -pass SMT system, our two -pass semantic SMT model does the r e verse: it takes the output from a first -pass SMT system, and then corrects it with the aid of sema n tic analyzers .
