 The event is objective and its action, object, time and environment are also objective, which do not depend on the language. From t he aspect of the event semantic , the meaning of the sentence s in natural language can be represented by the specific event dependent and there are event semantic relationsh ips between them. How to represent event semantic s and event relation semantic for news texts has become a hotspot in the fields of computational linguistics and natural language processing.
 Some cognitive scientists think that `event` is the basic knowle dge unit for human to know the real world [1] . And the communication between human is also event -based. For example, the CIKM 2014 meeting was held in Shanghai on November 3 -7, 2014, which descr ibed an event with action, object, time and location thematic roles etc. The description style is common when we make a summary or plan. It is event -based formation. I t can dynamically describe the event which occurred or will occur. Simi-larly, this description style is also common in news texts. The main contents of news treat as con stituting of many events, where the event appear dependently on event relations . T he news texts can be structured event -based , which can help computers how to read event, and how to figure out the meaning of what they have read. We treated event as a knowl edge unit and represented event semantic and event rela-tion semantic in news texts, which benefit to event ontology and event -based knowledge reasoning. Firstly, we introduce d some related work about event represen-tation (section 2). And then, we gave an e vent model and some concepts of event gave a novel framework of event semantic and the method to represent event thematic roles including actio n, object, tense, environment and some fuzzy information modifi-er of them . Additionally, we represent some concepts in objects of event in detail with Description Logic . Finally, we gave a novel framework of event relation semantic to represent the different event relations in the news texts (section 4) . 2.1 Event The concept of `event` originate s from cognitive science, and later, it was introduced gence. However, there is no consensus on the concept of events among them at pre-sent. Because there are different purposes in the different fields, the definition of the event is not the same [1] .
 In the field of phil osophy, the philosopher s regard the event as a concrete fact ch ang-sequences of behavior. The event i nvolved some different entities in the objective world, and the entity depended on the event.
 aspect and think that the e vent is a time segment in which the descriptor imagine a Chung [3, 4] think t he event is a term that consisted of three main parts of the predi-cate, the event framework, and the event community. IN recent years, some linguists have studied the events from the grammatical structure and thought that the basic predicate is the main content of the event semantics, and represented the event seman-tics with syntax trees [5, 6] .
 In the field of inform ation and artificial intelligence, they mainly defin e events from the aspect of information identification and knowled ge representation. They focus on the structure of the event, the event identification and extraction, event reasoning and event . TDT [8] regard the event as a refinement of the topic and thought that the event is on e thing occurring at a determined location and time. 2.2 Event Representation At present, ontology language and Neo -Davidsonian event semantic are the main methods to represent event.  X  Ontology Language Ontology language mainly includes RDF (S) [9] , OWL [10] and DL [11] , etc., which concept s . However, event is dynamic, which is different from the static concept. Some researchers extended ontology language and proposed new ontology language to represent event semantic. Chang L iang [12] proposed a unified formal framework called dynamic description logic, which can represent both of static and dynamic knowledge. Wei Liu considered the dynamic feature of event and extend ed O WL and DL to represent event for event ontology [13, 14] . Based on c onceptual dependence theory, Schank [15] used script to represent some event sequences and action se quenc-poral and spatial information in terms of qu antity and quality, and provided a power-ful set of operations including the reasoning from existing temporal and spatial rela-tionships to unknown relationships.  X  Neo -David sonian Event Semantic The Neo -Davidsonian event semantics are derived from the marriage of formal se-mantics and event semantics. Classical work in formal semantics, such as Montague [17] , represents the meaning of a verb with n syntactic arguments as an n -ary relation. Davidson [18] argued that ve rbs denote relations between events and their arguments; syntactic arguments are also arguments of the semantic predicate. Neo -Davidsonian position [17, 19 -21] relates the relationship between events and their arguments by thematic ro les; syntactic arguments as well as modifiers are combined with the event via thematic roles. Kratzer, A. [22] thought verb described the relation between event and its thematic roles. Champollion [23] made event semantics go well together with quantification by presenting a simple, variable -free framework which combines a Neo -Davidsonian event semantics with a type -shifting based account of quantifier scope. And he [24] argued that distance -distributive items acros s languages are in essence overt versions of these operators, described and explained observable cross -linguistic differences in overt distributive items in the framework of Neo -Davidsonian algebraic event semantics.
 Ontology language, especially DL and OW L, are the concept -based knowledge repre-sentation approach, which focus on the definition of concept and classification rela-tion between concept s . The ontology language is good for representing the static do-main knowledge through the conceptual taxonomy, a nd it is an effective way t o repre-sent the specific model. The Neo -Davidsonian event semantics represent the event semantic of natural language from the perspective of linguistics . It treated event pred-icate as univariate predicate with only event argument and introduced their arguments by thematic roles into the event sematic structure. It has more detailed event semantic than Davidsonian event semantic. However, the Neo -Davidsonian event semantic mainly focus on specific examples of English corpus and dis cussed specific modifiers of them. It didn X  X  discuss some other modifiers of events such as fuzzy information, complex object, complex environment and some concepts describing object of event etc. There are many different event relations , which include cau sality , following , con-currency etc . The ontology language only described the classification relation, and the Neo -Davidsoni an event semantic didn X  X  represent them . 3.1 Event Model Definition 1 event [1] : We define event as a thing occurring in a certain time and envi-ronment, which some actors take part in and show some action features. Event e can be defined with a 6 -tuple formally as formula (1) We call elements in 6 -tuple as event elements. Where A denotes an action or a set of actions happen in an event. O denotes objects involved in the event, including all fine two types of actors, action initiators and action recipients . T denotes time in the event. V denotes the location of an event ; P denotes assertion, which describes object when the event happening. P ost -condition is a result set of object statuses after event happens; L denotes language expressions of text -based event, it includes a Core Words Expressions (CWE) set and a Core Words Collocations (CWC) set [1] .
 Example 1 : A traffic accident occurred between a bus and a taxi in the New Territo-ries area of Hong Kong at about 6 pm on Jan 19, 2015.  X  http://news.sina.co m.cn/c/2015 -01 -20/001431418455.shtml  X  The event instance can be represented by 6 -tuple event model as shown in Table 1 .
 There are many events (called natural events) in news texts, which describe what happened in the real world. However, there are also many events (called idea event) in news texts, which describe who reported the natural event or some person and or-ganization expressed their opinion on the natural event s . They are greatly different differentiate idea event from natural event.
 Definition 2 idea event: it is also an event, which indicate that news media reports an event occurring in the real world (called natural event) or some person and organiza-tion express the ir opinions on the natural event. We call the natural event as idea con-tent of idea event.
 Example 2 : Xinhua News Agency reported Sichuan Wenchuan occurred 8.0 earth-quake on May 12, 2012. Report is an idea event. The idea content of report is that Sichuan W enchuan occurred 8.0 earthquake on May 12, 2012.
 3.2 Event (Class) Relation The relationships between events are divided into two categories: taxonomic relation and non -taxonomic relations. The taxonomic relation describes the hierarchical struc-between event classes. Non -taxonomic relations describe the internal semantic rela-tionships between events or event classes, including composition relation, follow relation, causality relation, concurrency relation and id ea content relation [14] . Definition 3 Subsumption relation (is_a): An event class can subsume or be subsumed by other event classes; an event class subsumed by another is called a sub eve nt class (or sub event type) of the subsuming event class (or super event type). Definition 4 Composition relation (Composition):If an event instance e1 of class EC1 can be decomposed to several sub -events ei (i&gt;0, instance of class ECi) with smalle r granularity, and while all the smaller events ei happened denotes e happened, there are composition relationship between e and ei (or EC1 and ECi). Definition 5 Causality relation (Causality): If an event e1 (instance of EC1) happened, then another eve nt e2 (instance of class EC2) happened at above a specified probabil-EC1 is cause and EC2 is effect. Definition 6 Follow relation (follow): Follow denotes events coming a fter in time order, as a consequence or result, or by the operation of logic. If in a certain length of time, the event e2 (instance of class EC2) follow event e1 (instance of class EC1) at above a specified probability threshold, there is a follow relatio nship between e1 and e2 (or EC1 and EC2). Definition 7 Concurrency relation (concurrency): If there are event e1 (instance of class EC1) and event e2 (instance of class EC2) occur simultaneously or successively in a certain period of time (the two event are coincident events), there is a concurren-cy relationship between e1 and e2 (or EC1 and EC2). Definition 8 Idea content relation : If there are event e1(idea event) and event e2(natural event), and event e2 is the idea content of event e1, then there is an idea content relationship between event e1 and event e2.
 describe the relations between the event classes, The other five kinds of relationships can be used to describ e both the relations between the event classes and the relations between the even ts . The sentence s in the news text s not only describe the events and their arguments via thematic roles, but also the relationship s between the event and the other event. Therefore, firstly, we gave a new framework of event representation, and then repre-sent event action, object, tense and environment and their some modifiers. Finally, we the news texts. 4.1 A New Framework of Event Representation We did marriage 6 -tuple event model and Neo -Davidsonian event semantic and gave a new framework of event semantics to represent event s and their arguments . The f ramework treated event predicate as univariate predicate including only event argu-ment and connected event predicate with event arguments by thematic roles via  X  symbol. Where the  X  symbol only denotes a connection symbol between event predi-cate and event arguments. The new framework of event semantic is shown in formula ( 2 ) Where e denotes event argument,  X  e denotes an existing event.  X   X  ( e ) den otes event  X  ( e , T ) denotes the time role of event and T denotes the content of time role.  X  ( e , V ) denotes the environment role of event and V denotes the content of environ-ment role.  X   X  ( e , P ) denotes assertion role of event and P denotes the content of asser-content of language expression role.
 environment appear in the text by an explicit way and can be found directly. Howev-er, the assertion and lan guage representation appear by an implicit way, which can be found by some machine lear ning methods. We only represented the thematic roles that can be found directly from the news texts. . 4.2 Fuzzy Information Modifier Representation
Fuzzy sets were first pr oposed by Zadeh . The definition of a fuzzy set from Za-deh's paper [25] is: Let U be a space of points, with a generic element of U denoted by u. Thus U = {u}. A fuzzy set A in U is characterized by a membership function  X   X  , which associates of  X   X  (  X  ) at u representing the "grade of membership" of u in A. that is shown as for-mula ( 3 )  X  of u in A.
 There are some words such as "very", "most", "more", "somewhat" combined with fuzzy words to describe some new fuzzy information in news texts, which can be represented using a tone operator. There are some words such as  X  X ossible X ,  X  X bout X  c ombined with certain information to describe fuzzy information in news texts, which can be represented using a fuzzy operator. There are some words such as  X  X ostly X ,  X  belong to X  combined with number to describe fuzzy information in ne ws texts, which can b e represented using a judgment operator [26] . Let seriously has a member-sent d ifferen t degree of seriousness  X   X   X  4.3 Action Representation T here are some adverbs and instrument s to describe the event action in the news information. The instrument describe the used instruments, when event occurred. We extended the action thematic role  X   X  ( e , A ) in formula ( 2 ) with the degree of member-role is shown in formula ( 4 ) . In the sentence of news texts that describes the event, some objects are the initiators of the event in sentence and OT is the recipients of the event in sentence.  X  1  X  Jin ke stabbed Qin violently. (1a)  X  e [  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (  X  )  X   X   X  ( e , stabbing ,  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ( u ) ) (1a) can be interpreted as follows: there was a stabbing event, its action was stabbing. Its initiator was Jinke, its re cipient was Qin and the condition of event was violently In order to represent the instrument of event , w e introduced tool thematic role  X  . Tool ( e , tool ) as an independent thematic role in the framework of event represen-tation .  X  2  X  Jin ke stabbed Qin with a sword. (2a) can be interpreted as follows: there was a stabbing event, its action was stabbing, its initiator was Jinke, its recipient was Qin and the instrument of event was a sword. 4.4 Object Representation Additionally, there are some numbers or fuzzy information t o describe the number of initiators and recipients in sentence. In order to represent many different initiators or recipients of the same event , we used cumulating operator [27]  X  to combine many different initiators or recipients t o a bigger initiator or recipient. The cumulating oper-ation is shown in formula ( 5 ) O =  X  1  X   X  2  X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X  (  X  ,  X   X   X  ,  X   X   X  ) ( 5 ) Where O denotes the cumulated object .  X   X  denotes a initiator or recip ient of the same event in news text.
 respectively. Then the object role is shown in the formula (6) T here are some event objects which is describe d with concept s in the news texts. We represented them in detail with Description Logic.  X  3  X  The driver and the passenger were injured. (3a)  X  e [ injuring ( e )  X   X   X  ( e , injuringing )  X   X   X  . Theme ( e , driver  X  passenger ) ] (3a) can be interpreted as follows: there was an injured event and its action was injur-ing, its recipients were the driver and the passenger. Additionally , driver and passen-ger were the two different concept s . We represent ed them in detail with DL as follows: Driver = People  X   X  Driver . car , Driver  X  Human , Human  X  Animal  X  Biped  X  4  X  T hree people were injured (4a)  X  e [ injuring ( e )  X   X  (4a) can be interpreted as follows: there was an injured event, its action was injuring, its recipient was person and the number of persons was three. 4.5 Tense Representation
Events usually are events that occurred in the past, events that are occurring and event s that will occur in the news text. These events correspond to the past tense, now tense and future tense respectively. And the time roles of event in news texts usual ly have time interval and time spot, which denotes a span of time and a spot on the time axis.
 In Neo -Davidsonian event semantic, I and t are related to the tense of event. I denotes tense, I=now denotes the now tense. I&gt;now denotes the future tense.
 When we consider the tense of event, the framework of event semantic is shown in formula ( 7 ) .  X  I [ ET  X  (  X  e ) (  X   X  ) [ W here I denotes time interval, E T denotes tense, which can be I&lt;now  X  I=now a nd I&gt;now. We didn X  X  consider the tense of event except for the (5) in order to simplify the framework of event representation .  X  5  X  Jinke stabbed Qin.
 When considered the tense of the above event, (5) can be represented as shown in (5a) (5a)  X  I [ I &lt;  X  X  X  X   X  (  X   X  ) (  X   X  ) [  X   X   X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (  X  )  X   X   X  (  X  ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  )  X  (5a) can be interpreted as follows: there was a stabbing event, which occurred in some was Qin. 4.6 Environment Representation In news texts, the environment of event usually includes a single environment, many different environments that are in the same -level, many different environments that are not in the same level and the environment which is changed during the event oc-curring.
 We introduced the cumulating operator  X  into the environment role  X   X  ( e , V ) to repre-sent the many different environments that are in the same level. We introduced the containing operator  X  into the environment role  X   X  ( e , V ) to express the many different environments that are not in the same level. The containing operator  X  is shown in formula ( 8 ) Where environment 1 and environment 2 are the environment of the same event in the news text. Environment 1 contains environment 2 in the aspect of g eographic location divi sion.
 We introduced the moving operator  X  into the environment role  X   X  ( e , V ) to represent the environment that is changed during the event occurring. The moving operator  X  is shown in formula ( 9 )  X  6  X  Jin ke stabbed Qin in the palace . (6a)  X  e [  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (  X  )  X   X   X  (  X  ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  )  X   X   X  .  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (  X  ,  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  )  X  (6a) can be interpreted as follows: there was a stab bing event. Its action was stabbing . Its initiator was Jinke and its recipient was Qin. Its environment was in the palace.  X  7  X  Obama visited China, Russia, and Korea. (7a)  X  e [  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (  X  )  X   X   X  ( e , visiting )  X  (7a) can be interpreted as follows: there was a visiting event. Its action was visiting. Its initiator was Obama. Its environment was the China, Russia and Korea. Where the three countries were the environments of the visiting, which were in the same level.  X  8  X  T he earthquake occurred in Wenchuan county Sichuan province. (8a)  X  e [ earthquaking ( e )  X   X   X  ( e , earthquaking )  X   X   X  ( e , Sichuan  X  Wenchuan ) ] (8a) can be interpreted as follows: there was an earthquake event. Its action was earthquaking. Its environment role was wenchuan county Sichuan province. Where Wenchuan County was part of Sichuan province.  X  9  X  The airplane flew from Beijing to Shanghai. (9a)  X  e [ flying ( e )  X   X   X  ( e , flyig )  X   X   X  . Agent ( e , airplane )  X   X   X  ( e , Beijing  X  (9a) can be interpreted as follows: there was a flying event. Its action was flying. Its initiator was the airplane. Its environments were Beijing and Shanghai. Where the environment of the event was changed when the fly has occurred. 4.7 E vent R elation Representation texts. We introduced some different operato rs of event relation to represent the corre-sponding event relation in the news texts. The event relation semantic can be repre-sented in the for mula (10 ) W here ei and ej are the two different events.  X  (  X   X   X   X   X  ) denotes there is an event rela-tion R between ei and ej and the type of event relation is T, which can be  X   X   X   X   X   X   X  and  X  .  X  denotes idea content relation.  X  denotes causality relation.  X  denotes composition relation.  X  denotes follow relation.  X  denotes concurrency relation.  X  10  X  The earthquake caused Tom to die . (10a)  X  e1 [ earthquaking ( e1 )  X   X   X  ( e1 , earthquaking ) ]  X   X  e2 [  X  X  X  X  X  X  (  X  2 )  X  (10a) can be interpreted as follows: there was an earthquake event, its action was Additionally, there was an event relation between e arthquake event and death event, and the type of event relation between them was causality. W e did marriage between 6 -tuple event model and N eo -Davidsonian event semantic and proposed a novel framework of event semantic to represent the event semantic in the news texts . We extended some operators to represent some modifiers of event including fuzzy information, instruments, and event arguments via thematic roles. We gave a framework of event relation semantic to represen t different event relationships between events in news texts. The given examples indicate the frameworks of event semantic and event relation semantic have good abilities to represent event semantic s and event relation semantics in the news texts. Human us ually know the real world in the form of event classes , and o n the basis of these work s , we will do some research on semantic knowledge representation and reasoning of event classes .
