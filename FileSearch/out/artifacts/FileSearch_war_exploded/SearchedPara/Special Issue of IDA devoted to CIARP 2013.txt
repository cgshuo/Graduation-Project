 This special issue is devoted to the 18 th Iberoamerican Congress on Pattern Recognition (CIARP). CIARP is the yearly event of a series of conferences on Pattern Recognition organized by the national associations active in the field of Pattern Recognition and related areas in Iberoamerican countries. The 2013 edition of CIARP has been held in Havana, Cuba, November 20 X 23, 2013, and this special issue includes the extended versions of selected CIARP 2013 papers.

Researchers from 37 countries, out of which 12 Iberoamerican, submitted 262 contributions to CIARP 2013. An international Program Committee consisting of 183 prestigious scientists had the task to rig-orously evaluate the submissions. At the end of the reviewing process, 138 papers were accepted. The presentation type, oral or poster, was established by taking into account a number of factors, such as the wider or narrower size of the interested audience. In any case, all contributions were presented in plenary sessions. Besides the 138 accepted submissions, the scientific program of CIARP 2013 also in-cluded the contributions of three outstanding invited speakers, namely Jian Pei (Simon Fraser University of Canada), Fabio Roli (University of Cagliari, Italy) and Tieniu Tan (National Laboratory on Pattern Recognition of China).

By taking in consideration i) the scope of the Intelligent Data Analysis Journal (IDA) and the topics treated in the CIARP 2013 papers, ii) the recommendations about the suitability of CIARP 2013 papers for the IDA journal, done by the Program Committee members who handled reviewing of the conference papers, iii) the a verage scores assigned to each contribution by its referees , and iv) the quality of the presentations done by the Authors at the conference, we selected 13 top CIARP 2013 contributions and invited their Corresponding Authors to submit extended versions of their CIARP2013 papers to IDA by February 20, 2014. Actually, though we knew that the maximum number of papers that can be published in a single IDA issue is definitely smaller than 13, we invited the Authors of all the 13 selected top CIARP 2013 papers to submit extended versions of their conference articles. For the sake of clarity, we informed the Authors that even if their papers were recommended for publication, their inclusion in the special issue could not be a priori guaranteed. In fact, all papers for which acceptance was recommended had to be ranked and, if their number was higher than the maximum number of papers in a single issue, only a subset with the top ranked articles would have been included in this special issue.
Each IDA submission was assigned to two or three referees and, in general, underwent two reviewing rounds of which only the first one might have been ended in a major revision decision. Some papers for which referees still requested major revision at the end of the second round were rejected to avoid delaying the publication of the whole special issue. As a result of the reviewing process, 8 papers were accepted for publication in this special issue.
 The theme of the first two papers in the special issue is Comparison Measures.
 In  X  X n Empirical Comparison among Quality Measures for Supervised Classification X , Milton Garc X a-Borroto, Octavio Loyola-Gonz X lez, Jos X  Fco. Mart X nez-Trinidad and Jes X s Ariel Carrasco-Ochoa face the problem of measuring the quality of a contrast pattern, which is an active and relevant area of pattern recognition and data mining. Authors present an empirical comparison of the behavior of 33 quality measures in the context of supervised classification and contrast pattern filtering. The experimentation using several databases compares the behavior of these measures in three different contexts: as aggre-gation value, as pattern evaluation for classification, and as pattern evaluation for filtering. Experiments also show that top accurate quality measures for classification have a deceptive performance for pattern filtering, because they cannot distinguish among patterns with zero support in the negative class. In  X  X n the Generalization of Mahalanobis Distance X , Gabriel Martos, Alberto Mu X oz and Javier Gonz X lez generalize the Mahalanobis distance for general unimodal distributions, introducing a par-ticular class of Mercer kernel, the density kernel, based on the underlying data density. The induced distances are useful when data do not fit to the Gaussian distribution. The Authors also develop the the-oretical properties of the proposed distance and show its performance on a variety of artificial and real data analysis problems.
 The successive three papers deal with Structuralization of Data Sets.
 In  X  X ddressing the Validation of Overlapping Clustering Algorithms X , Henry Rosales-M X ndez and Yunior Ram X rez-Cruz propose a new external measure specifically designed for validating overlapping clusters, which fulfills the main set of desirable conditions presented in the literature. The Authors also show that the proposal correctly handles situations where previous measures display undesirable perfor-mances.
 In  X  X onstraint Acquisition Methods for Data Clustering X , Joao M.M. Duarte, Ana L.N. Fred and F. Jorge F. Duarte propose two constraint acquisition methods based on user-feedback. The first method searches for non-redundant intra-cluster and inter-cluster query-candidates supported by information contained in an initial partition of the data set, ranks the candidates by decreasing order of interest and, finally, prompts the user the most relevant query candidates. The constraints may optionally be used for learning a new data representation, which may enhance the performance of clustering. The second method iterates between using the previous method for expanding the set of constraints, and producing an updated partition of the data.
 In  X  X eep Auto-encoder Based Clustering X , Chunfeng Song, Yongzhen Huang, Feng Liu, Zhenyu Wang and Liang Wang propose a new clustering method based on the deep autoencoder network, which can learn a highly non-linear mapping function. Via simultaneously considering data reconstruction and compactness, the introduced method can produce stable and effective clustering. The experimental re-sults on four databases demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve promising performance in terms of normalized mutual information, cluster purity and accuracy.
 Finally, the last three papers deal with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, Classification and Image Indexing. In  X  X lobal Stability Improvements on Adjusted Sig moid Fuzzy Cognitive Maps X , Gonzalo N X poles, Rafael Bello and Koen Vanhoof give an explanation of why most studies on Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) stability are not applicable to FCM used on classification or decision-making tasks. Based on this, they describe a non-direct learning methodology based on Swarm Intelligence for improving the system stability once the causal weight estimation is done. This fact allows computing more stable maps, therefore allowing better consistency in hidden patterns.

In  X  X ombining Hybrid Rule Ordering Strategies Based on Netconf and a Novel Satisfaction Mech-anism for CAR-based Classifiers X , Raudel Hern X ndez-Le X n, Jes X s A. Carrasco-Ochoa, Jos X  Fco. Mart X nez-Trinidad and J. Hernandez-Palancar introduce four novel hybrid rule ordering strategies for building a classifier based on Class Association Rules (CARs). Additionally, they combine the proposed strategies with a novel  X  X ynamic K X  satisfaction mechanism that allows improving the performance of CAR-based classifiers.

In  X  X mage Indexing using Regularized Online X , Jorge A. Vanegas and Fabio A. Gonz X lez propose a novel method for image indexing based on an online learning approach, which can deal with large repositories of images. The proposed method is based on a semantic embedding strategy, which models a mapping between visual and text representations. This method can be used to search into the collection using an image as query (query-by-example strategy) and to annotate new no annotated images.
We take this opportuni ty to express our sincere gratitude to all the Authors who submitted their works to the special issue. Special thanks are due to the anonymous referees that provided important comments, definitely useful for the Authors to improve their contributions. We are also indebted to the Editor in Chief of this journal, Prof. Fazel Famili, who kindly accepted our proposal for the special issue and was always available to help us in answering questions done by contributors and solving problems before they could have created troubles during the reviewing process.

We hope that readers of IDA will enjoy reading this special issue, and will find it as a useful and interesting reference for their future work.
