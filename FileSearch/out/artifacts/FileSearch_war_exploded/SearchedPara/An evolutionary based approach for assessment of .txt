 1. Introduction
During an earthquake, significant damage can result due to instability of the soil in the area affected by internal seismic waves. Liquefaction is known as one of the major causes of ground failure due to earthquake. Assessment of lique faction potential and determina-tion of liquefaction induced lateral spreading are complex geotech-nical engineering problems and have attracted considerable attention of geotechnical researchers in the past three decades ( Javadi et al., 2006 ). A number of analytical models have been developed to predict and evaluate liquefaction potential and liquefaction-induced lateral spreading ( Youd et al., 2001 ). In recent years, by pervasive developments in computational software and hardware, several alternative computer aided patte rn recognition approaches have emerged. The main idea behind pattern recognition systems such as neural network, fuzzy logic or genetic programming is that they learn adaptively from experience an d extract various discriminants, each appropriate for its purpose. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multi-layer regression (MLR) are the most widely used pattern recognition procedures that have been introduced for determination of liquefaction occurrence and liquefaction induced lateral displacement ( Juang and Chen, 1999, Bartlet and Youd, 1992 ).
The ANNs models have the ability to operate on large quantities of data and learn complex model functions from examples, i.e., by training on sets of input and output data. The greatest advantage of ANNs over traditional modeling techniques is their ability to capture nonlinear and complex interactions between the variables of a system without having to assume the form of relationship between input and output parameters. In the context of determi-nation of liquefaction occurrence, ANNs can be trained to learn the complex relationship between the soil and earthquake character-istics with the liquefaction potential and lateral spreading, requir-ing no prior knowledge of the form of the relationship. However, themaindisadvantageof theneuralnetwork-basedapproachisthe large complexity of the network structure, as it represents the knowledge in terms of a weight matrix together with biases which are not accessible to user ( Rezania et al., 2010 ).

In this paper a new approach is introduced based on evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR) for assessment of the liquefaction potential and lateral spreading due to earthquakes. The EPR models for evaluation of liquefaction potential and lateral spreading are trained and tested separately using two different datasets of field case histories. The data for evaluation of liquefaction potential are collected from different sources in the literature and include 420 field cases. The lateral spreading dat aset includes 484 case histories from 11 earthquakes gathered from the literature. The results of the developed models for evaluation of liquefaction and lateral spreading are compared with those obtained from the most commonly used technique in each case. It is shown that the EPR models are able to learn, with a very high accuracy, the complex relationship between liquefaction and its contributing factors in the form of a function; and generalize the learning to provide predictions for new cases that are not used in the construction of the model. 2. Evolutionary polynomial regression method based on evolutionary computing, aimed to search for polynomial structures representing a system. A general EPR expression can be presented as ( Giustolisi and Savic, 2006 ) y  X  where y is the estimated vector of output of the process; a constant; F is a function constructed by the process; X is the matrix of inputvariables; f is afunction defined bythe user;and n is the number of terms of the target expression. The general functional structure represented by f (X, a j ) is constructed from elementary functions by
EPR using a genetic algorithm (GA) strategy. The GA is employed to select the useful input vectors f rom X to be combined. The building blocks (elements) of the structure are defined by the user based on understanding of the physical pro cess. While the selection of feasible structures to be combined is done through an evolutionary process; the parameters a j are estimated by the least square method. 2.1. Some features of EPR the combination of the genetic algorithm to find feasible structures and the least square method to find the appropriate constants for those structures implies some advantages. In particular, the GA allows a global exploration of the error surface relevant to specifically defined objective functions. Using such objective (cost) functions some criteria can be selected to be satisfied through the searching process. These criteria can be set in order to (i) avoid the overfitting of models, (ii) push the models towards simpler structuresand(iii) avoidunnecessary termsrepresentative of the noise in data. EPR shows robustness and can get a model truly representative of data. An interesting feature of EPR is in the possibility of getting more than one model for a complex phenomenon. A further feature of EPR is the high level of interactivity between the user and the methodology. The user physical insight can be used to make hypotheses on the elements of the target function and on its structure (Eq. (1)). Selecting an appropriate objective function, assuming pre-selected elements in Eq. (1) based on engineering judgment, and working with dimensional information enable refinement of final models. A typical flow diagram for the EPR procedure is illustrated in
Fig. 1 . Detailed explanation of the method is out of scope of this paper and can be found in Giustolisi and Savic (2006) and Rezania et al. (2008) . 3. Evaluation of liquefaction potential using EPR approaches the confining pressure in loose, saturated sands under earthquakeloadingwhere,as aresultof arapidanddramaticlossof soilstrength,itcan initiatemovementoflarge blocksofsoilcausing extensive damage to civil engineering structures ( Youd et al., 2001 ). Liquefaction occurrence depends on the mechanical characteristics of the soil layers in the site, the depth of the water table, the intensity and duration of the ground shaking, the distance from the source of the earthquake and the seismic attenuationpropertiesofin-situsoil.Becauseoftheparticipationof a large number of factors that affect the occurrence of liquefaction during earthquake, the determination of liquefaction potential is a complex geotechnical engineering problem and has attracted considerable attention of geotechnical researchers in the past three decades. 3.1. Current practice in prediction of liquefaction occurrence of liquefaction. In many of these methods, using field records, empirical correlations were established between site conditions and earthquake properties with the occurrence or non-occurrence of liquefaction at the site. The  X  X  X implified procedure X  X  is the most widely used method for the investigation of liquefaction potential of sandy soils ( Seed and Idriss, 1971 ). In this method, which has been modified and updated several times ( Youd et al., 2001 ), initially the earthquake-induced cyclic stress ratio, CSR (which represents the cyclic loading on the soil), is determined and then the cyclic resistance ratio, CRR (which is the capacity of a soil layer to resist liquefaction), is calculated for the estimation of earthquake-induced liquefaction potential. The factor of safety against liquefaction triggering of the soil at a specific depth is then defined as FS  X  CRR CSR  X  2  X  case is less than 1, the occurrence of liquefaction is predicted.
On the other hand if FS 4 1 then it is considered as a non-liquefied case.

To predict the liquefaction potential of soils in conventional methods, researchers have proposed diagrams with boundary lines that separate field conditions causing liquefaction from conditions not causing liquefaction ( Seed and De Alba, 1986; Seed et al., 1985; Stark and Olson, 1995 ). These diagrams are usually standardized for an earthquakemagnitudeof 7.5 onthe Richterscale. Instandard penetration test (SPT)-based procedures these boundary lines are usually drawn in a plot of CSR versus corrected SPT blow count (SPT(N 1 ) 60 ), whilein cone penetrationtest (CPT)-based procedures, limit state lines are presented in a plot of CSR versus corrected CPT tip resistance, q c 1 N ( Seed et al. 1983 ). A number of statistical methods have also been developed following the same general approach (e.g., Liao et al., 1988 ). In addition, Shibata and Teparaksa (1988) , Robertson and Wride (1997) , Suzuki et al. (1997) and Idriss and Boulanger (2004) have proposed relationships between CRR and q c 1 N to separate the liquefied and non-liquefied zones. More recently neural networks have been employed to develop alternative models for determination of liquefaction occurrence, based on both SPT and CPT field data ( Goh, 1994; Goh, 1996; Najjar and Ali, 1998; Ural and Saka, 1998; Juang and Chen, 1999; Hanna et al., 2007 ). Juang et al. (2003) used their trained neural network model to obtain an ANN based empirical equation to approximate the unknown limit state function.

In this paper, a new approach is presented for prediction of liquefaction potential using EPR. Unlike the ANN-based approach, the EPR model provides a structured and transparent representa-tion of the relationship between liquefaction potential and its contributing factors. Comparison is made between the results of the EPR model and those of the ANN based model. 3.2. Evaluation of liquefaction potential using EPR 3.2.1. Case history database
The database used in the present study consists of 420 cases collected from various locations worldwide, and include 179 cases of liquefaction occurrence and 241 non-liquefied cases. Details of thesecasesare presentedinTableAintheAppendix(columns1 X 9). These cases were derived from CPT measurements at over 157 sites relating to 17 different earthquakes from various locations in Asia, America and Europe. The soil in these cases ranges from clean sand to silty sand to clays. 3.2.2. Parameters affecting liquefaction
The most influential parameters affecting the occurrence of liquefaction have been used to develop the EPR model. The same parameters have been used by some other researchers for develop-ment of traditional and pattern recognition-basedmodels ( Youd etal., 2001; Seed and Idriss, 1971; Robertson and Wride, 1998; Juang et al., 2000 ). These parameters include q c 1 N , s u v , I c and CSR q q  X  measured cone tip resistance [kPa], s u v  X  effective overburden pressure at the point of CPT measurement [kPa], CSR in the present study is defined as ( Youd et al., 2001 ) where s v  X  total vertical stress of the soil at a specific depth; a max  X  peak horizontal ground surface acceleration; g  X  gravity acceleration; MSF  X  magnitude scaling factor; and r d  X  shear stress reduction factor.

The variable r d is calculated as ( Youd et al., 2001; Liao et al., 1988 ) r  X  1 : 0 0 : 00765 z if z r 9 : 15m r  X  1 : 174 0 : 0267 z if 9 : 15m o z r 23m  X  5  X  MSF is calculated as ( Youd et al. 2001 ) MSF  X  10
The value of MSF obtained from Eq. (6) represents the lower bound of the range of MSF values recommended by the NCEER workshop( Youdetal.,2001 ).Eqs.(5)and(6)arecommonlyusedby geotechnical researchers and practitioners, although many other formulae have been proposed for calculating r d and MSF ( Juang et al., 2003 ).
 The variable I c is defined as ( Lunne et al., 1997 ) I  X  X  X  3 : 47 log 10 q c 1 N  X  2  X  X  log 10 F  X  1 : 22  X  2 0 : 5 where F (normalized friction ratio) is F  X  f c =  X  q c s v  X  X  8  X 
In Eq. (8), f c  X  sleeve friction; and both f c and s v are in units of kPa. It should be noted that the soil type index I c defined in Eq. (7) is different from the soil behavior type index defined by Robertson and Wride (1998) . However, for the cases used in this study, the difference between the two definitions is small, generally less than 1% (for soils with I c r 2.6) to 10% (for soils with I c 4 2.6). 3.2.3. Data division
Generally, in pattern recognition procedures (e.g., neural network, fuzzy logic or genetic programming) it is common that the model construction is based on adaptive learning over a number of cases, then the performance of the constru cted model is evaluated using an independent validation dataset. In data mining techniques, the way in which the data are divided into training and validation sets has a significant effect on the results ( Javadi et al., 2006; Rezania and Javadi, 2007 ). In this example the entire database was divided into several random combinations of training and validation sets until a robust representationofthewholepopulationwasachievedforbothtraining and validation sets.

To select the most robust representation, a statistical analysis was performed on the input and output parameters of the randomly selected training and validation sets. The aim of the analysis was to ensure that the statistical properties of the data in each of the subsets were as close to each other as possible and thus represented the same statistical population. In this work a trial and error process was used to achieve this. In this way, the most statistically consistent combination was used for construction and validation of the EPR models. The parameters used in the statistical analysis included maximum, minimum, mean and standard devia-tion. The results of the statistical analysis of the finally selected combinationsareshownin Table1 .Itshouldbementionedthatdue to the fact that the data contains singular, rare events that cannot be replicated in all cases of the dataset, there may still be some minor inconsistencies in the statistical parameters for the training and validation sets.

From the total of 420 case histories of recorded liquefied and non-liquefiedcasesinthedatabase,340cases(80.0%)wereusedfor training of the EPR models while the remaining 80 cases (20.0%) were used for validation of the trained EPR models (the validation cases are indicated with a  X  *  X  sign in Table A). In the training dataset, the number of liquefied cases and non-liquefied cases are 193 and 147, respectively. Also in the validation dataset 48 cases are related to liquefied fields and 32 cases are related to non-liquefied fields.
In the development process of the EPR models, a number of constraints can be implemented to control the constructed models in terms of length of the equations, type of the functions used, number of terms, range of exponents, number of generations, etc. It can be seen that there is a great potential in achieving different EPR-based models for a particular problem which enables the user to gain additional information for different scenarios ( Rezania et al., 2008 ). In this study, based on the results of different alternative analyses, the optimum set of constraints for the problem of determination of liquefaction potential was found as described in the following.
 tionary process. For simplicity of the evolved expressions the power of variables was restricted to integer values from 2to2. Also, the maximum number of terms was set to 10.
 evolutionary process, different participating parameters are gradually picked up and used to form the equations representing the input X  output relationship. The level of accuracy for the constructed models in each generation is evaluated based on coefficient of determination (COD) as the fitness function. The COD function used in this study is COD  X  1 where Y a is the actual output value; Y p is the predicted value and N is the number of data points on which the COD is computed. During the evolutionary search, the EPR model selection is lead by a multi-objective strategy ( Doglioni et al., 2008; Giustolisi and Savic, 2009 ;
Giustolisi et al., 2008 ). The three objectives considered for this process are: (i) the number of constants, (ii) the total number of inputs involved in each formula and (iii) the model fitness in terms of coefficient of determination estimated on the training dataset. This approach ranks the returned formul ae in terms of the fitness to data, the number of constant values and the total number ofinputs involved in each formula. If the model fitness is not acceptable or the other termination criteria (in terms of maximum number of generations and maximum number of terms) are not satisfied, the current model should go through anoth er evolution in order to obtain a new model.
Table 2 . From the table, it is clear that the relationships obtained from the first generation include all the affecting parameters.
Among the relationships generated by the EPR process, the following one was selected according to its performance on both training and testing sets. The selected model is
Y  X  ROUND 0 : 00777 I 2 c CSR 2 : 5 10 where ROUND is the operator that rounds the calculated value of the function to the nearest integer. Table A (appendix table) shows the results of training of the EPR model with the case histories involved in each category (columns 10 and 11). For each case,  X  X 1 X  X  represents the occurrence and  X  X 0 X  X  denotes non-occurrence of liquefaction. In this table, the symbol  X  X  O  X  X  shows that the EPR model can correctly predict the occurrence or non-occurrence of liquefaction for the case history under consideration, and the symbol  X  X  x  X  X  indicates that the EPR model is unable to accurately evaluate the occurrence or non-occurrence of liquefaction. The selected model is able to provide accurate predictions of the liquefaction potential in 97.65% of the cases for training data. model, Eq. (10) was used to predict the liquefaction potential for case histories which were not used in the training process and the resultsare showninTableA.Itisseenthatthe developedmodelcan correctlypredictthe liquefactionpotentialin95%ofthecasesinthe validation dataset. 3.2.4. Limit state boundary surface differentsetsofthreecontributingparameters canbe consideredto study the existence of a boundary surface that separates liquefied cases from non-liquefied cases. These combinations are (iii) CSR, I c , q c 1 N (iv) CSR, q c 1 N , s u v the cases in the database were plotted in the corresponding 3-D space. It was observed that for the first three combinations, the majority of the liquefied and non-liquefied cases were mixed with each other and it was hard to  X  X  X isually X  X  identify a specific border between them. However, for the fourth combination of parameters a clear boundary surface was identified that separates the liquefied and non-liquefied cases. Therefore the fourth combination was selected to develop a boundary surface between liquefied and non-liquefiedcases. In order to develop sucha surface, the values of CSR, q c 1 N and s u v for a number of boundary points located on the boundary surface had to be found.
 the boundary surface. For this purpose Eq. (10) was solved for every single case history in the database except those for which liquefaction occurrence was not correctly predicted (12 cases in total). Since the round operator in Eq. (10) returns  X  X 1 X  X , when the value of the function inside the bracket is greater than 0.5 and returns  X  X 0 X  X  when it is less than  X  X 0.5 X  X , therefore in order to find the coordinates of points located on the boundary surface, the function in Eq. (10) was set equal to 0.5 (see Eq. (11)) and this equation was then solved for each case history. 0 : 5  X  0 : 00777 I 2 c CSR 2 : 5 10
For example, when Eq. (11) was applied to a particular case historytofindthelimitvalueforCSR,all variables,exceptCSR,were fixed to their known values and Eq. (11) was solved to find the unknown limit value of CSR. This procedure was repeated consecutively for q c 1 N and s u v to find the corresponding limit values for these parameters. In this way, from one case history in the database the coordinates of three virtual marginal points located on the boundary surface could be found. It should be noted that because Eq. (11) is of a high order with respect to some variables, there might be unrealistic values when it is solved for a particular variable (e.g., negative or imaginary value); these values clearly have no meaning and should be discarded.

A surface fitting program developed in MATLAB s was used to fit a 3D surface through the generated virtual marginal points. The best surface passing through artificial points was CRR  X  exp  X  6 : 994  X  7 : 9 10 6 q c 1 N 2 : 5  X  1 : 115 Ln  X 
The value of COD for the selected surface (Eq. (12)) passing through marginal points is 97%, which is a good indication of the robustness of the equation. Fig. 2 (a) and (b) shows the plots of the surface generated with Eq. (12) inthe space of CSR, q c 1 N two different angles.

Eq. (12) was successfully used to discriminate liquefied cases from non-liquefied cases. When it was applied to (i) the cases used to develop the boundary surface and (ii) the entire database, the liquefactionpotentialwasevaluatedcorrectlyin97.3%and93.8%of the cases, respectively. Fig. 3 (a) X (c) shows the liquefied and non-liquefied cases, together with the boundary surface in the space of CSR, q c 1 N and s u v from three different angles. 3.2.5. Comparison with existing methods
In order to assess the performance of the proposed EPR-based model in providing improved predictions of liquefaction potential, theresultsofthemodelwerecomparedwithotherexistingmodels. From the literature, the methods proposed by Juang et al. (2003) , Robertson and Wride (1998) and Olsen (1997) are the only methods which have been developed completely based on CPT data to evaluate the CRR ( Juang et al., 2003 ). Juang et al. (2003) compared their simplified model with Robertson and Wride (1998) method and Olsen (1997) method and concluded that it outperforms the other two models. Therefore, in this paper, Juang et al. (2003) model is used as a reference to examine the performance of the developed model.

The comparison was made based on the CRR values and the values of the factor of safety against liquefaction for the case histories, calculated using these two methods. Juang et al. (2003) proposedthefollowingempiricalmodeltocalculateCRRbasedona series of least-square regression analyses, which have been concluded from an ANN based model: CRR  X  C s exp  X  2 : 957  X  1 : 264  X  q c 1 N , cs = 100  X  1 : 25 where C  X  0 : 016  X  s u v = 100  X  3  X  0 : 178  X  s u v = 100  X  2 0 : 063  X  s q K  X  2 : 429  X  I c  X  4 16 : 943  X  I c  X  3  X  44 : 551  X  I c  X 
It should be noted that in the above formulation (i.e., Eq. (13)) the maximum value for s u v is limited to 215 kPa.

When Eq. (13) was applied to the cases in the database, the level of accuracy was 81.9% for the cases used to find Eq. (12) and 81.2% for the entire database, while the corresponding values obtained using the model developed in this work (i.e., Eq. (12)) were 97.3% and 93.8%, respectively. This indicates that Eq. (12) not only is more straightforward and has less calculation steps than Eq. (13) but also more accurate for the assessment of liquefaction potential. Comparison of the results obtained from the two models is presented in Table A (columns 12 X 17). 4. Evaluation of liquefaction induced lateral displacements using EPR
Liquefaction is known as one of the major causes of ground movement and failure related to earthquake. It can initiate movement of large blocks of soil with amplitudes ranging from a few centimeters to 10 m or more, eventually causing extensive damage to buried utilities, lifeline networks and many other underground and surface civil engineering structures. Liquefaction induced lateral displacement generally occurs on gentle slopes ranging from 0.3 1 to 3 1 ( Committee on Earthquake Engineering (1985) ) founded on loose sand with groundwater level fairly close tothegroundsurface;however,openfaceslikestreamchannelsare also susceptible to lateral spreading.
 depend on the physical and mechanical characteristics of the soil layers in the site, depth of the water table, intensity and duration of the ground shaking, distance from the source of earthquake and seismic attenuation properties of in-situ soil. Because of the participation of a large number of factors, the determination of liquefaction-induced lateral displacement is also considered as a complex geotechnical engineering problem. 4.1. Current practice in estimation of liquefaction induced lateral displacement lateral displacement is the empirical model proposed by Bartlett and Youd ( 1992 ). The original procedure was later updated and modified ( Bartlet and Youd, 1995 ). Recently another revised version of the equations has been presented ( Youd et al., 2002 ).
In this work the multiple linear regression (MLR) method was used on a large database of case histories from several major earthquakes in the United States and Japan. In this procedure, two different site conditions were considered separately, and as a result two different site-specific MLR models were presented, one for each of the two site conditions. The free face model was derived from the cases where there was a free face towards which lateral displacement could occur, and the ground slope model has been derived from the type of cases without a free face but with a gently sloping ground condition. The most recent revised models ( Youd et al., 2002 ) are as follows:
For free face conditions: log D H  X  16 : 713  X  1 : 532 M 1 : 406log R 0 : 012 R  X  0 : 592log W  X  0 : 540log T 15  X  3 : 413log  X  100 F 15  X  0 : 795log  X  D 50 and for gently sloping ground conditions: log D H  X  16 : 213  X  1 : 532 M 1 : 406log R 0 : 012 R  X  0 : 338log S  X  0 : 540log T 15  X  3 : 413log  X  100 F 15  X  0 : 795log  X  D 50
In Eqs. (14) and (15) D H (m) is the horizontal displacement, M ( M w ) is the earthquake magnitude, R * is a distance factor that is a function of earthquake magnitude and is defined as where R (km) is the nearest horizontal distance of the seismic energysourcetothesite, W (%)isthefreefaceratio, S (%)istheslope of ground surface, T 15 (m) is the cumulative thickness of saturated cohesion-less soil layers with corrected SPT number ( N 1 than 15, F 15 (%) is the average fines content (finer than 75 m m) for granular materials included within T 15 and D 50 15 (mm) is the average mean grain size for granular materials within T 15 approach provides reasonably good estimation of expected lateral displacements for cases with large lateral spreading (greater than about 1.5 m) but it cannot provide an accurate and reliable prediction of lateral displacement for cases with measured lateral spreading less than about 1 m ( Seed et al., 2003 ). Currently the reliable estimation of liquefaction induced lateral displacement within this range is the state-of-the-art problem in this field ( Seed et al., 2003 ). A more recent work on this problem has been done by Baziar and Ghorbani (2005) using the same database as Youd et al. (2002) . They have developed an ANN model to predict the horizontal ground displacement due to liquefaction in both ground slope and free face conditions. 4.2. EPR models for estimation of lateral spreading A database of SPT-based case his tories,compiledbyYoudand Bartlett ( 2002 ) has been used in this study to find the relationship between liquefaction induced lateral displacement and its contributing factors. The database includes 484 entries of liquefaction-induced lateral spreading from 11 major earthquakes. A list of the case studies is summarized in Table 3 . 4.2.1. Case history database and data division
The case histories involving the lateral displacement towards a free face and those corresponding t o gently sloping ground have been analyzed separately. In the database, 228 cases are related to free face ground condition and the remaining 256 cases involve gently sloping ground. The difference between the two types of ground condition is reflected in the geometry of ground surface at the location of the displacement vectors. As shown in Fig. 4 , the free face case is characterized by the free face ratio ( H ff / L ff ), where H of the free face (i.e., difference between the crest and toe elevations) and L ff is the horizontal distance from the toe of free face to the displacement vector. In the data re lating to gently sloping ground condition, the ground slope ( S ), which is the overall (average) inclination of the ground surface, is considered as an input variable.
One of the advantages of the proposed EPR model is that in this approach, there is no need to introduce new (artificial) parameters (e.g., R * in the MLR model) or use functional (e.g., logarithmic, etc.) values affecting parameters; all parameters can be fed into the model as they are, without any normalization or calibration.
The same procedure as explained in Section 3.2.3 was employed to divide the entire database into the appropriate training and testing subsets. The results of the statistical analysis of the finally selectedtrainingandvalidationsubsetsareshownin Tables4 and5 for free face and gently sloping ground conditions, respectively. 4.2.2. EPR model for lateral displacementin free faceground condition
From the total of 228 case studies of lateral displacement that involve free face condition, 185 cases (81%) were used for training the EPR model while the remaining 43 cases (19%) were used for validation of the trained EPR model. After the analysis of different alternative models, the following expression was found to be the most robust and practical model: D
Eq. (17) describes lateral displacement as a function of the contributing factors, for the case studies where there is a free face towards which lateral spreading can occur. The results of the EPR model have been compared with those obtained independently using the MLR ( Youd et al., 2002 ) and the ANN models (Baziar and
Ghorbani, 2005). Fig. 5 (a) and (b) shows the comparison of the results for training and validationsets, respectively.In addition,the results of the comparison between the performances of the EPR,
MLR and ANN models in terms of coefficient of determination ( R root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) criteria are summarized in Table 6 . These coefficients are defined as R 2  X 
RMSE  X  MAE  X  where N is the number of case histories and X m and X p are the measured and predicted values (lateral displacement in this case), respectively.
 the complex relationship between the soil and the earthquake parameters with lateral displacements with a very good accuracy.
For higher values of lateral displacements (greater than about 1.5 m) the ratio of predicted to measured displacements is generally in the range of 0.5:1 X 2:1, which is a reasonable band of accuracy for risk assessment given the uncertainties involved. (17))wasexaminedusingthevalidationdataset.Thepurposeofthe model validation is to ensure that the trained model has the ability to generalize the training to predict lateral displacements for unseen cases. The model was validated with data from 43 cases and the results are shown in Fig. 5 b together with those of the MLR and ANN models. It is shown from the figures that the developed model provides very good estimates of expected displacements for cases with displacements greater than about 1.5 m in both training and validation stages.

In general, comparison of the values of coefficient of determina-tion ( R 2 ) for the three models indicates that the EPR model provides results that are more accurate than those of the MLR and ANN models. However, it should be noted that, the whole database has been used in the developmentof the MLR model and it has not been validated against an independent (unseen) set of case studies, whereas only about 80% of the cases have been used in the construction of the EPR and ANN models with the other 20% being used for independent validation. 4.2.3. EPR model for lateral displacement in gently sloping ground
The database also includes 256 case histories of lateral dis-placement in gently sloping ground. These cases were used for the development of the second EPR model for sloping ground condi-tions. Of these, 201 cases (78.5%) were used for training of the EPR model and the remaining 55 cases (21.5%) were used for validation. After the analysis of a number of different alternative models, the following model was found to be the most appropriate model for gently sloping ground condition: D  X 
Eq. (21) describes lateral displacement as a function of the contributing factors for gently sloping surface conditions. The results of the ERP model (Eq. (21)), together with those attained independently using the relevant MLR and ANN models for gently sloping ground, are shown in Fig. 6 (a) and (b) for the training and validation cases, respectively.

The performances of the EPR, MLR and ANN models have been evaluated based on the R 2 , RMSE and MAE criteria and the results are summarized in Table 6 . Comparison of the values of coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) for the three models shows that EPR model has been able to learn the underlying relationship more accurately than the MLR and ANN models. Fig. 6 (b) shows that the EPR model has also been able to give better prediction of lateral displacements for unseen cases than the MLR and ANN models. 4.2.4. EPR models for moderate lateral displacements
It is seen from Figs. 5 and 6 that, in general, the EPR models (Eqs. (16) and (17)) predict lateral displacements with high accuracy, particularly for cases with displacements greater than 1.5 m. However, as shown in Fig. 7 (a) and (b) (which are the enlarged views of the initial parts of Figs. 5 (a) and (b) and 6 (a) and (b), respectively), this approach does not provide the same level of accuracy in the estimation of lateral displacements for cases with moderatedisplacementsoflessthanabout1.5 m. Youdetal.(2002) have highlighted the importance of the prediction of moderate displacements. At present, there are no well-calibrated and verified engineering tools for accurate and reliable estimation of lateral displacements in this range ( Seed et al., 2003 ).

Considering the difficulty in modeling moderate lateral dis-placements accurately, in this study, two specific EPR models have been trained for cases involving moderate displacements (one for free face and one gently sloping ground conditions). For these models, the data from the case histories involving displacements of up to 1.5 m were used for training and validation.

From the free face cases in the dataset, 103 cases involve moderate displacements of up to 1.5 m of which, 85 cases were used for training and the remaining 18 cases were used for validation of the EPR model. Similarly, 114 cases in the gently sloping ground dataset have measured displacements less than Measured Displacement (m) Measured Displacement (m) 1.5 m; from these, 92 cases were used for training and 22 cases for validation. After a series of training, the following EPR models were obtained for moderate lateral displacements:
D H  X  12 : 7493 T 15 D 50 and for gently sloping ground cases:
D H  X  1 : 8017 RD 50 moderate displacements are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 together with those of the MLR and ANN models. The performances of the models were also evaluated based on the R 2 , RMSE and MAE criteria ( Table 7 ).
Comparison of the results of the EPR, MLR and ANN models shows that the EPR models for moderate displacements significantly outperform the MLR model. Also the EPR models give satisfactory results, comparable with those obtained from the ANN model; however, given that the EPR models have clear polynomial structure they outperform the ANN model from the application point of view. The performance of the MLR model is particularly poor in the range of moderate displacements and it predicts lateral displacements greater than 1.5 m (outside the range of moderate displacement) for over 30% of the cases for both training and testing. 5. Summary and conclusion liquefaction induced lateral spreading are complex geotechnical engineeringproblems.Inthispaper anew approach was presented, based on evolutionary polynomial regression, for assessment of the liquefaction potential and lateral spreading due to earthquakes.
Separate EPR models were developed and tested for evaluation of liquefaction potential and lateral spreading using two different datasets of actual field case histories.
 tion potential using a large CPT database of field data. Comparison of the results shows that the EPR model outperformed the existing neural network based model. The main criticism of the neural network-based model is its inability to present an explicit relation-ship between input and output parameters. This shortcoming is overcome in the proposed EPR model by generating a structured representation of the system. The nature of EPR permits global exploration of expressions and allows the user to gain additional information on how the system performs, i.e., gives an insight into the relationship between input and output data.

In addition to the proposed EPR model, a 3D boundary surface has been developed for assessment of liquefaction potential. Both the EPR model and the 3D boundary surface have been applied to prediction of liquefaction potential and have shown high values of COD above 93% for the database used in this study, while the ANN based model has shown a COD value around 81%.

For the case of evaluation of liquefaction induced lateral displacements two general EPR models were trained and validated using a database of SPT-based case histories for free face and gently sloping ground conditions. Two other specific models were presented for more accurate prediction of moderate lateral displacements of up to 1.5 m. All EPR models have shown COD values greater than 90%, which is a good indication of the robustness of models. Comparison of the results shows that the results predicted by the proposed EPR models provide an improve-ment over the ANN and MLR models. It was shown that in both cases the EPR models are able to learn, with a very high accuracy, the complex relationship between liquefaction and its contributing factors in the form of a function, and can also generalize the learning to provide predictions for new cases not used in the construction of the model. An additional advantage of the EPR approach is that there is no need to assume a priori the form of the relationship between the input and the output parameters, and the form of the relationship, the number and combination of the terms and the values of the coefficients can all be evolved during construction of the model (training).

One of the strongest points of the proposed approach is that a part of the data is set aside and used for validation of the trained EPRmodelinordertoexaminethegeneralizationcapabilitiesofthe developed model in making predictions for unseen cases. Usually, this is not the case in the traditional regression-based models. Appendix A. Supplementary material
