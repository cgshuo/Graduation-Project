 DM-SSP  X 06 was the fourth year there has been a conference on data mining standards, services and platforms and the sixth year that there has been a conference on the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) and related areas. The workshop consisted of five talks and two panels. DM-SSP  X 06 was the fourth year there has been a conference on data mining standards, services and platforms and the sixth year that there has been a conference on the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) and related areas. The goal of the DM-SSP workshops is to bring together developers who are interested standards based frameworks for data mining systems and applications that a) prepare data for data mining, b) produce data mining models, or c) employ data mining models.
 Today, there are a variety of standards, proposed standards, and specifications that are used in data mining, including PMML [1], SQL-based standards such as SQL/MM Data Mining [3], Java standards such as JSR 73: Data Mining API [2], and Microsoft X  X  XML for Analysis (XMLA) web service specification [4].
 There are also two other movements in the broader commu-nity of developers that are of interest to those developing data mining systems and applications. First, service ori-ented architectures are becoming more common, and this is beginning to impact how data mining is deployed. Second, there is an active community developing standards for grids, and some of these standards are relevant to data mining. This year X  X  workshop brought together developers, practi-tioners, and researchers from these various groups to dis-cuss standards based systems, applications, and platforms for data mining. Historically, data mining has been mainly concerned with data that is static and at rest. Over the past few years, attention has also focused to data that is streaming. The talk  X  X PC: A Distributed, Scalable Platform for Data Min-ing X  by First, Lisa Amini, Henrique Andrade, Ranjita Bhag-wan, Frank Eskesen, Richard King, Philippe Selo, Yoonho Park, and Chitra Venkatramani discussed a stream based data mining system and the architecture emerging for these types of systems.
 Because of the way many applications are deployed in op-erational systems or integrated with business processes, it is often useful to use one system for building or estimating statistical and data mining models ( model producers ) and another system for producing scores with these models us-ing operational data ( model consumers ).
 The Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) is an XML standard for data mining models, as well as for many of the common operations required for preparing data for data mining, and is often used as an interchange format between models producers and consumers.
 Over the past several years, PMML and related data min-ing standards have matured to the point that conformance of applications to PMML and interoperability have become relevant for many users and for many applications. The talk  X  X onformance Standard for the Predictive Model Markup Language X  by Rick Pechter addressed this issue. This was followed by demonstrations of interoperability between vari-ous PMML consumers and producers from different vendors. The paper  X  X ugustus: The Design and Architecture of a PMML-Based Scoring Engine X  by John Chaves, Chris Curry, Robert L. Grossman, David Locke and Steve Vejcik dis-cussed an open source PMML-based scoring engine called Augustus and an associated PMML-repository that has been used in applications employing thousands to millions of sep-arate PMML models.
 Many applications can benefit by employing standards for specific types of data, such as text, images, and other un-structured information, as well as domain specific standards. The paper  X  X MML and UIMA Based Frameworks for De-ploying Analytic Applications and Services X  by David Fer-rucci, Robert L. Grossman and Anthony Levas discussed how PMML could be integrated with the open UIMA frame-work for mining unstructured information, such as text, im-ages, etc. The paper  X  X atML: XML for Information Ex-change with Materials Property Data X  by Aparna S. Varde, Edwin F. Begley, and Sally Fahrenholz-Mann discussed a markup language for materials called MatML and analytic applications built using it. MatML is useful for exchanging materials property information. Early data mining systems were generally closed in the sense that data was loaded into the system and reports were pro-duced. To deploy models into operational systems required hand coding the required models and data preparation code. This approach for deploying models was labor intensive to say the least.
 Later, some data mining systems began to support an export mechanism allowing models to be exported into SQL, C++ or Java. For some applications, it was helpful to have a format for data mining models that was independent of the language and of the application  X  PMML was introduced to to fulfill this requirement.
 As a sign of the maturity of data mining standards, here are some examples from the workshop of how data mining is being deployed today: In this section, we discuss some research problems for stan-dards based data mining platforms that were identified in the workshop and related discussions.
 We begin with three broad challenges that have been ac-tively discussed for the past several workshops. This year was no exception. In addition, this year also saw active discussion of the fol-lowing three research challenges related to standards based platforms for data mining: During the morning of the workshop, the following papers were presented: During the afternoon of the workshop, there were several discussions regarding the upcoming release of PMML Ver-sion 3.2 (expected in the fourth quarter of 2006) and user requirements for future releases of PMML.
