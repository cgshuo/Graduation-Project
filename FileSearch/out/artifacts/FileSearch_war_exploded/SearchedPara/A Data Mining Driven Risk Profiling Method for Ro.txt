 Road surface skid resistance has been shown to have a strong relationship to road crash risk, however, applying the current method of using investigatory levels to identify crash prone roads is problematic as they may fail in identifying risky roads outside of the norm. The proposed method analyses a complex and formerly impenetrable volume of data from roads and crashes using data mining. This method rapidly identifies roads with elevated crash-rate, potentially due to skid resistance deficit, for investigation. A hypothetical skid resistance/crash risk curve is developed for each road segment, driven by the model deployed in a novel regression tree extrapolation method. The method potentially solves the problem of missing skid resistance values which occurs during network-wide crash analysis, and allows risk assessment of the major proportion of roads without skid resistance values. G.1.1 [Mathematics of Computing]: NUMERICAL ANALYSIS: Interpolation  X  X  xtrapolation, / G.4: MATHEMATICAL SOFTWARE: Algorithm design and analysis Risk management; data mining; model deployment; road asset management; mi ssing data; skid resistance. Road asset managers have huge and diverse volumes of data at their disposal, including results from the significant road surface friction measure surveys. Skid resistance is a standardized measure of the road surface friction between the road surface and a skidding tire, and is recognized as the best established link between road attributes and crash risk (Cairney 2008, [1]). General world-wide practice re lies strongly on historically developed skid resistance heuristics to identify risky roads for decision support in budget decisions [2]. This traditional method of relating roadway demand cat egories and corresponding skid resistance investigatory levels has the potential for over or under engineering of roads not conforming to the norm, thus approving unnecessary expenditure or creating latent safety issues. In the data available, the presence of missing values and data quality issues favoured a scope of analysis converging towards local, homogeneous roadway segm ents, which is the norm for current roadway research [3]. However to solve the problem of finding all skid resistance problem roads, a scope of analysis of the whole road network was required. Thus a method was sought to overcome the limitations of the missing data. This paper proposes a two-part solution. Based on the premise that historical roadway data can predict future crash rates [4], a regression tree model was trained on those data from the crash locations with skid resistance surveys available (40% of all crash locations) to predict the aggregated crash rate of each 1 km road segment. The bagged M5 algorithm [5], fitted with roadway features, road wear, crash and traffic variables, returned a coefficient of determination (r-sq) above 0.9 and was able to predict the full range of values in the crash range when deployed over the network. With the mode ls developed, a deployment solution was sought to identify risky roads, including the 60% of crash locations without the key skid resistance survey results. To manage this situation, a depl oyment of the model used a  X  X hat if X  data table framework. This method allowed the model to be deployed as a predictive engine in a crash /skid resistance profile for each crash location in the network. To provide the x-axis of the profile, each crash location instance was replicated and collectively populated with skid resistance (F60) values between the maximum and minimum at a default increment. To provide the corresponding y-value of the skid resistance/crash rate point for each replicate, the model was applied in the novel extrapolation process called regression tree extrapolation , and the crash prediction made. The combined points from the replicates produced a curve showing a change in crash rate with increase in skid resistance. Each curve was independently interrogated to seek the existence of a skid resistance threshold where the rate dropped to a low crash rate plateau. In complying roads, comparison between the known crash rate of the road way segment and the optimal predicted crash rate allowed identification of roads with elevated crash rate. Since the actual skid resistance of the road segment did not need to be known, the method could be applied to almost all roads. Thus the method provided a data-driven machine-learning method to identify risky roads from across the whole network. The crash curves showed three patterns: (1) the pattern outlined above; (2) non-skid resistance se nsitive roads showing little or no change found generally in low crash roads; and (3) erroneous patterns. The data wa s  X  X bservational X  in nature, being sourced from other projects, and had many aggregated values and known quality issues. The emergence of the consistency of strong patterns of skid resistance thre sholds in results reinforced the appropriateness of both the modelling method and the  X  X hat if X  approach. The method was evaluated by appl ying the principles of Coppi X  X  Informational Paradigm [6]. Coppi provides the precursor of a formal data mining framework that allows acceptance of inductively derived knowledge us ing non-statistical data and methods, e.g. databases and data mining algorithms, when applied compliantly within the methodology . The high-level of confluence found between the components of the study was an indicator of goodness. Agreement was found among the domain knowledge, the statistical models and data mining models evaluated in the study X  X  Strategy of Analysis . In summary, (1) the problem of complexity has been solved by combining an extrapolation method with a regression tree model to analyze road crash data, and (2) the generation of a skid resistance/ crash rate profile sidestepped the problem of the missing values in the experimental variable skid resistance , thus allowing the whole of the roadway dataset to be processed. The rest of the paper is as follo ws. Section 2 pres ents the related work. Section 3 introduces the datase t that we have for analysis. Section 4 discusses the prop osed methodology. Section 5 evaluates the results and provides the related discussion. Road crash studies initially used statistical methods such as Analysis of Variance, Linear Regression, Poisson Regression, Negative Binomial Regression and L og Linear in the examination of homogenous or near homogeneous road sections. Investigations have examined roadway features, prevailing conditions and traffic factors related to the causes of crashes or to predict crash rate [3,4]. Analyses generally compared limited classes of roadways, with further limitations such as data quality, distribution assumptions and experimental design imposed by statistical methods [3]. A second wave of road and crash analysis, applying data mining (DM) on reasonably homogenous data, has shown skid resistance to be significant. A method, using Random Forest Trees to examine crash severity on arterial roads, concluded that high skid resistance has a correlation with severity of accident [7]. Outcomes from a study of skid resistance and texture depth on crash rate in an expressway t unnel found an inverse relationship between crash rate and skid resistance [8]. A similar inverse relationship between crash rate a nd skid resistance was recently described using clustering to evaluate the effects of skid resistance and texture depth in crash rates [9]. A third wave of road crash analysis progressed from historic aggregated crash rate to examination of conditions leading up to individual crashes, and fitted models with real-time traffic conditions to predict imminent crashes, thus allowing modification of traffic flow [3]. The commonality in most road-crash analysis, represented by these studies, is examinati on of homogeneous or near homogeneous roadway with above -mentioned limitations. This study extends the capability of th e second wave by demonstrating a data-driven method of analysis for the heterogeneous data representing the whole network, and allowing the effect of all participating variable s to be expressed. The debilitating problem in our scenario was missing skid resistance values. With the analysis focused on assessing the skid resistance of all sealed roads, a solution was required to accommodate the 60% of crash locations without skid resistance values. Statistical imputation methods fo r replacing a small proportion of missing values with a value or set of values from a similar class have been in long usage. For a larger proportion of missing values, methods have applie d data mining, and include deployments of association mi ning [10], decision tree [11], multilayer perceptron [12] and nearest neighbor [13]. Recently, Kwak X  X  single replacement imputation method developed for a very large proportion of missing values, utilizing the multivariate DM environment [14], demonstrated that imputation of the proportion of missing values in our study was well within reach. The method, relying upon the intrinsic similarity between instances in like classes found in a small proportion of the population, select ed the "optimal" value before data mining, and demonstrated the capability of managing between 50% and 90% of missing values in a given attribute. Our non-replacement method, also conducted in the multivariate DM environment, relies on the sim ilarity of relationships within classes in a small but representative population. However the method benefits from non-rejection of any imputations, with the benefits including the presence of a powerful context for understanding the behavior of the predictions across the value range of the attribute of interest, skid resistance, and identification of aberrant predictions. Inspired by the  X  X hat if X  DM deployment study [15], our testing of crash rate with the regression tree model across the full range of skid resistance solved both the missing value problem and provided a model deployment method to produce the skid resistance/crash rate curve. While road systems are evolutionary with a cyclic, unknown dynamic dependent on improveme nt, maintenance, degradation and weather, this study treats the four year period as a snapshot. The road data is evolutionary in the sense that crash locations were populated with the latest roadway data by crash date. However, because of natural variability and complexity, crash rates were averaged over the full four years and do not reflect the potential evolutionary change. Non-crash roads were excluded from the analysis because of the lack of detailed site data and lower significance. All available crashes were included because of their potential for traffic disrupti on [3], and the crash data set, while believed to be reasonabl y complete, suffers from being reported crashes only [4]. Extensive data imputation of the road data was required using comparative annual studies and transactional files, but with insu fficient data, a small proportion of crashes was dropped. The fundamental premis e accounting for roads with elevated crash rate is that crashes are caused by bad decisions made by drivers in an environment resulting from surrounding traffic conditions and the unforgiving geometric designs created by engineers (or wear/damage) [3]. Logic dictates that crash-prone roads [16] would maintain high crash-rate from year to year if road dynamics were a major contributor to crash. Thus the first role of the proposed Strategy of Analysis was to demonstrate that roads actually maintained their crash rate from year to year. The commonly used absolute road segment crash rate (crashes/km /yr) was selected as the target. With awareness of the increasing randomness with reducing interval si ze, the industry 1km distance interval was selected [4] and a 4 year time span selected to moderate the fluctuations between individual years. The road segment crash counts were calculated by counting the total number of crash instances per 1 km road segment. Crash counts ranged from 1 to 100 crashes for the four years, making the range of annual crash averages from 1 to 25 crashes, while annual totals ranged from 0 to 32 crashes. To investigate the annual variation in crashes, th e average annual crash count of each road segment was plotted against the annual crash count. Examination of Figure 1 shows that roads at a given average crash count maintain a range distribu ted around the average value, and collectively yield a Poisson-like distribution. 
Figure 1 Poisson distribution of annual road segment crash Thus, roads did maintain a characteristic crash count range from year to year. While the population c ount of road segments of each average dropped exponentially as th e crash count increased, each average had sufficient data elemen ts to maintain its "normal like" distribution through to the average count of 15. Above a crash rate of 15 crashes/km/4 years, the distributions became random, but members of the range remained capable of discrimination. A careful examination of the median confidence levels in the quartile box of each average shows only minor overlapping, ascertaining that the averages are generally significantly different. Labels A, B and C show the quartile projections on to the annual crash count axis, showing qui te distinct differences. The road and crash attributes are listed in Table 1. Skid resistance values were averaged from 100m av erages to match the 1 km road segment values. The survey results were relatively scarce; having been performed on only about 25% of the road segments either prior to or during the data sampling period. When allocated to the crash locations, only 40% had skid resistance values available, either before or after the crash. The presence or absence of skid resistance effectively partitioned the crash location dataset into two discrete sections and the dataset with skid resistance values became the training set. The relationship betwee n these data sets is represented by: DS = TR U NS where DS is the whole crash/road segment dataset, NS is the non-skid resistance data subset, and TR is the data subset with skid resistance values and is used as the training set.
 The modeling objective was developed to analyze the behavior of the one km road segments using the enhanced data at the crash sites, i.e. to predict the one kilomete r road crash segment crash count at available crash sites us ing road characteristics at the crash sites and the general charac teristics of the road segment itself. a18 Traffic Annualized average This section proposes the skid re sistance/crash rate profiling method and outlines the me thod of evaluation. This method builds and applies the model in an extrapolated skid resistance/crash rate profile to produce a skid resistance/crash curve and queries the curve to identify road segments with elevated crash risk due to skid resistance deficit. The process is shown in Figure 2.
 Process A performs training of the model (M) on the data set (TR) with allocated skid resistance values (40% of the total road/crash dataset), using the algorithm bagged regression tree method M5 [5]. Bayesian, decision trees, and random forests methods were inappropriate because of their inability to predict numerical values. The road crash regressi on tree model demonstrated that roadway features and traffic rela tionships can well describe crash count [17]; however a dynamic process was required to apply the model to identify the roads with skid resistance deficit. Haas, 2011 [15] proposes applying data mining models in dynamic  X  what if X  extrapolation frameworks for unlocking the deployment potential of the model. We propose a profiling method that is a simulated experiment and has all of the hallmarks of the statistical hypothesis testing scenario, with rules that are imbued with an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that govern a system X  X  behavio r [15]. Our method distinguishes itself from the normal scenario of extrapolation, which calculate s predictions using a singular expression. This is achieved by deploying the regression tree method as the predictive engine. The set of expressions delivered by the regression tree model is expected to be more capable of accurate prediction than a single expression applied over the whole range. As mentioned above, we coined the term regression tree extrapolation for this process .
 In Process B , the risk profile for each road segment was generated by populating the x-axis with a default range of skid resistance values (PR) between 0.15 and 0.65 with an increment of 0.05. Each instance present in the dataset DS was replicated by using the values of the PR range and stored in a data set (DP). Let  X  X   X   X   X   X   X   X ,..,  X   X  where  X   X   X  to  X  X  X  are the input attributes including the skid resi stance attribute, and  X   X  is the original target value. Instances in DS are replicated by replacing the skid-resistance attribute value by constant values in the PR range:  X  X   X   X  X  X  X   X   X  ,..,0.15,..,  X   X  .........  X  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X   X  ,..,0.65,..,  X   X  . In Process C , the dependent y-axis value was predicted for each replicate through our process of extrapolation, where the method processes each skid resistance value along the x-axis using a series of rules, depending on the skid re sistance value of the replicate. Thus, based on the feature combination in the replicate under processing, the model selects the appropriate formula used to predict the crash rate ( y-value ). The predicted crash rate was added to the replicate records in the profile data set DP X . The prediction is represented by: where M is the model, DP is profiled crash-road table, and each instance has n attributes, of which 1 to n -1 provided the input variables and n th variable provided the target value. The model M was applied on each instance of DP with ( n-1 ) attributes values to predict crash rate, stored in the n th attribute, displacing the original target to the new position. This process creates the populated profile instance represented by: where attribute  X   X  denotes the predicted value by the model M and  X   X  X  X  denotes the original target value.
 With completion of the predictions, Process D creates visualizations of the crash risk curve (crash risk vs. skid resistance) for a given road segment to show the progression of crash risk with the increase in skid resistance for the road segment of the crash location. Process E identifies skid-resistance sensitive roads with elevated crash rates, performing below their potential best, that are subsequently tagged as 'investigatory' for prioritization. The investigatory flag is set when the crash rate of the roadway segment was higher that the predicted optimal crash rate. The optimal skid resistance value is read from the curve, without knowing or referring to the existing skid resistance value. Quality and configuration checks, planned in the Strategy of Analysis, were performed throughout. In the modelling stage, assessment included; (1) a compar ison of competing predictive algorithms; (2) a configuration optimization of the selected algorithm, and (3) an investigation into the poor deployment performance and its consequence to the outcomes. Subsequently to model deployment, profiles were assessed for goodness of both individual profiles and the met hod. Firstly, profiles were compared to studies with measur ed changes [1] and probabilistic studies [18] for the expected form of the curve, i.e. a drop in crash rate with an increase in skid resistance . For roads with skid resistance values, the actual crash rate/skid resistance point was checked for its proximity to the curve. Processes were developed to examine the global properties of the profile dataset (DP X ), i.e., examining the collect ive set of profiles for the proportion of erroneous profiles, the shift in dist ribution of skid resistance with optimization, and the shift in crash rates. Evaluations relied on finding the expected patterns as an assessment of goodness. In the first stage, algorithms capable of making numeric predictions were compared to find the best performing group. The algorithms, in default configurati on, were trained on the data set TR, and fitted with an improved version of the attribute list. The performance criteria were (1) high predictive capability when deployed on the whole network and (2) capability of prediction through the full range of crash values (1-100). The families tested included support vector machines , multilayer perceptron, nearest neighbor, regression and regression trees. Results in Table 2 show the corr elation coefficients (r) for both training and deployment over the whole network, and the capability of predicting the full ranges of crashes between 1 and 100 crashes in training in columns Min P.V .

The deployment correlation coefficients (r) are ranged from 0.612 to 0.816 with the highest returns and the capability to predict through the full range posted by bagged M5Rules (a variant of M5) and REPTree. Multilayer perceptron was found to produce excessive outliers. Of the models, Bagged M5Rules was selected over Bagged REPTree because of the compact readable rules. Figure 3 Crash range predicting ability of tested algorithms Examination of Figure 3 shows that the poorest performers included Least Mean Squares and linear regression, attempting to perform predictions with a single rule. Success of the regression tree was attributed to firstly classifying the road segments, then producing a rule for each class, rather than describing all relationships in a single rule. The results show that bagged M5Rules was among the best performers on training data, but all in deployment demonstrated a less than stellar correlation coeffici ent (r) of 0.8 (r-sq: 0.64). This degradation was thought to be caused by the high proportion of instances with null skid resistance values. To ascertain the effect of the missing skid resistance values on deployment classification accuracy, a model (M1) was trained with the same data (DS), except for the removal of the skid resistance attributes, making the da ta set (D1). In training, model M1 returned a correlation coefficient of 0.92, marginally below the model with skid resistance (0 .95). But in deployment the order was reversed, with the model w ith non-skid resistance returning 0.805 (r-sq 0.648), slightly above the skid resistance model deployed in the dataset degraded by the high proportion of skid resistance null values. Thus we conclude that the model (M) with skid resistance has the potential to perform much better than the model without skid resistance, shoul d the skid resistance values be known. However, the important que stion is how the change in skid resistance affects crash ra te and how the nulls impact on behaviors of predictions in the profiles data set (DP X ) on the instance replicates, with each set having a range of F60 values. To ascertain the effect of the changes in skid resistance on crash rate, a semi-random data subset was chosen from the training dataset (TR), and sorted on cr ash count during the selection process to ensure that a representation of all crash rates was present. The chosen instances were replicated making three sets of each, and the skid resistance values 0.2, 0.34 and 0.5 were inserted, one in each replicate. Modeling with the new data presented a shift into new territo ry, because the standard model statistics no longer applied since th e value of a significant variable had been changed. With model (M) deployed, the resu lts in Figure 4 show significant changes in crash count with an increase in the values of skid resistance. 
Figure 4 Change in predicted crash count with increasing Examination of the chart shows most instances experience a drop in crash rate with an increase in skid resistance, with the exception of some that increase (label A &amp; B), suspected of producing the erroneous skid resistance/crash pr ofiles, possibly due to a missing attribute. Further investigation is required. A third set show no crash rate response to skid resistance at all (label C). These results provide an excellent guide to the likely behaviors of predictions in the profiling method, and show that crash rate is very mobile, exhibiting dramatic changes in some cases, with an increase in skid resistance. These results provide evidence for the strong inverse relationship between skid resistance and crash rate, with the magnitude depending on the class of roadway. Returning to the question unanswered in Section 5.2 , this experiment shows that under the influence of the unknown but correct skid resistance value, crash rates are likely to move towards their  X  X orrect X  value, and the deployment would be expected to be higher than 0.80 (R-sq 0.64), were the values known. Thus the model is better th an indicated by the correlation coefficient. Further, the comparative model method in Section 5.2 shows only a small difference be tween models with &amp; without skid resistance, indicating that this method is relatively ineffective in judging the significance of an attribute. S ection 5.1 described the selection process in choosing the bagged M5Rules model (M). However, in an effort to improve the performance of the model, confi guration testing was performed, changing the rule splitting criterion of  X  X he minimum number of instances X  required for a split ( minNum ), to find the optimal level of generalization for the model. Results are shown in Table 3. Testing was performed on the complete road/crash location dataset without skid resistance (NS), selected to remove the effect of the missing skid resistance va lues in deployment. The default settings were used for the M5Rules algorithm except the minNum parameter. The parameter build Regression Tree remained at false to build a model tree with a regr ession formula at each leaf node. The parameter unpruned was set at false to allow automatic tree branch pruning, and use unsmoothed set at false to deactivate the process to compensate for prior smoothing of data. The configuration variable minNum was the experimental variable. As stated above, minNum configures the minimum number of instances required before branching is allowed on a condition, and thus determines the number of cla sses and rules in the model. The initial value set to 4 produced an over-fitted model with slight degradation in deployment. The split count value in Table 3 shows that the value of minNum was progressively doubled until a severely under-fitting model was produced at the value of 1024. With a progressive increase in minNum , the results show a successive reduction in rule s/class count. Results from deployment show that the most generalized model with near-best deployment performance has the minNum value of 32, providing a deployment correlation coefficient (r) of 0.8039 (r-sq 0.64) with the model having 111 rules. The production model (M) for this deployment in the method was built on the training data with skid resistance (TR) with default parameters, except for the minimum Number of Instances (minNum) set to this value 32. A plot of the crash rate vs. the predicted cras h rate produced by the model (M) is shown in Figure 5. This plot shows a reasonably narrow variance, endowing the model with the ability to predic t crashes within an acceptable tolerance, thus having the ability to discriminate. Examination of the vertical distribution of each prediction suggests them to be approximately Poisson distribut ed, with a region of highest density generally positioned centrally, with variation relative to the crash count. The variance is less of a problem than first appears, except in the lowe st crash range, were below 10 crashes/km/4yr, the variation is greater than the crashes being predicted, and thus the model loses its ability to successfully discriminate. The selected model (M), when deployed on the skid resistance/ crash profile dataset (DP), was used to predict the crash count values for each of the replicated instances. Examination of the set of skid resistance/crash count values for a given crash location from the profile dataset (DP X ) shows that the profiling process does operate as stated. Table 4 shows that with an increase in skid resistance (F60), a substantial decrease in the four-year crash rate values (CC) is predicted. This profile is represented by curve A in Figure 7. Table 4 Profile values of a sample crash site showing predicted A comparison of the measured skid resistance/crash point for this crash location at (1.8, 100) and th e curve shows that the point is almost directly on the curve, thus providing an absolute link between the real world and the profile: an instance of assessment contributing to the external validation process. As mentioned above, new metrics were needed to assess the result because the standard metrics were no longer relevant in a deployment where the data, skid resistance in each replicate, had been extensively modified. The first new method used a plot showing changes in predicted valu e (crash rate) in comparison to the target (original crash count). The plot shows the change in the predicted crash rate caused by the change in independent variable of the experiment (skid resistance) . As noted in Section 5.3, road sections can experience a large predicted change in crash count with a change in skid resistan ce, and the mobility is shown in Figure 6, with some road sections traversing the full range of crash rate with a corresponding change in skid resistance. 
Figure 6 Actual crash vs. predicted crash from the populated We can draw some ge neralizations from the plot, and foci of interest are highlighted by the labels A to D.  X  A: a high proportion of crash rates do not have high crash  X  B: in the region of low crash ra tes, fewer road segments have  X  C: even in the higher range of crash rates, not all crash  X  D: instances with naturally high crash count can experience Representatives of the crash rate/skid resistance curves from the profiles for various crash sites are displayed in Figure 7. Each of the locations shows the potential to substantially reduce exception of sample C which is a low crash-rate road. High crash-rate roads labeled A and G show the potential to substantially reduce their crash rate, with sample A experiencing a dramatic drop in crash rate with a skid resistance change from 0.18 to 0.25, but not falling below the crash-prone level until the F60 value of 0.6. Samples D &amp; E show a suspected erroneous trend requiring investigation in th e lower skid resistance ranges where crash-rates rise with a rise in skid resistance. A prototype application was deve loped to demonstrate the value of the method to road asset managers. The screenshot shown in Figure 8 shows an example of the skid resistance/ crash rate curve drawn by querying the model. Note that the model was developed using M5Rules (not bagged) with a more comprehensive dataset. This method utilized the model parameter of building the Regression Tree . With the parameter set to true, the model calculates an averaged results from all instances at the leaf nodes, rather than providing a rule. This configuration results in the flat plateau sections in the curve, each with a zero gradient for the F60 extent of a given rule. The curve shows the expected pattern with a high average crash rate (20 crashes/km/4yrs) at lower skid resistance values, followed by a rapid drop in crash rate at the skid resistance (F60) threshold of 0.35, and subsequently reaching a low crash rate plateau of 9 crashes/km/4-yr beyond the skid resistance threshold of 0.45. The change in skid resistance from 0.325 to 0.45 almost places the road into the target non-crash prone zone (Figure 8) [16]. The profile shows a level of consiste ncy between the predicted curve and the real world measure with the actual skid resistance/crash rate point almost on the curve. To assess the predictions collectively for the whole network, an algorithm was developed to scan a potential profile error state found in profiles inconsistent with the curve, i.e., of the crash minimum preceding the crash maximum. The results showed a high level of consistency, with only around 5% of profiles being highly inconsistent with the cu rve shown in Figure 7. Further analysis shows that predictions become progressively more erratic with low crash roads, as the crash count successively drops below 8 crashes/km/4yr, with this phenomenon thought to be a consequence of both the cr ash count dropping beyond the resolving power of the model and the natural unpredictability of low crash roads. However, examples of quality predictions are found in roads with uniformly low crash rates, as demonstrated by profile C in Figure 7. Since the method is making prediction of improved crash rate by generally increasing the skid resi stance, the range and distribution of skid resistance of optimized ro ads is expected to be above the existing range, and also be normally distributed. Data visualization shows this to be tr ue. Examination of Figure 9 shows that the range of measured skid resistance ranges from 0.19 to 0.65 in a near normal distribution. In the predicted optimal low crash model, the skid resistan ce ranges from 0.45 to 0.6 in a skewed normal distribution. This pattern indicates that the method is operating in a reasonabl e and expected way. 
Figure 9 Comparison of the road segment skid resistance The goal of a prediction of an optimized skid resistance value in our context is the reduction in crash rate. The process is performed in stage F of the met hod (Figure 2) which predicts a consequential reduction in crash rate with the optimal skid resistance value. A comparison of the original crash count values and the potential improve d crash count predicted by the process is shown in a distribution in Figure 10, with the predicted optimal crash rate generally be low 20 crashes/km/4yr. 
Figure 10 Comparison of recorded crash rates and predicted, The comparison between the distributions of recorded crash rates and predicted optimal rates shown in Figure 10 and Table 5, show a huge potential improvement th roughout the network, with almost 75% of crash sites appro aching or achieving crash rates below the crash-proneness level of 8 crashes/km/per 4 years. In comparison, the probabilistical ly developed skid resistance profiles [18] show low-crash threshold ranges of skid resistance values lower than ours, with values between of 0.32 and 0.45, compared to the range from our model between 0.45 and 0.6. The difference is thought to be cau sed by modeling on low volume, wet roads where our method does not perform as well. In other comparisons, Cairney X  X  before a nd after resealing studies show crash rate drops of 23% for dry and 68% for wet road crashes [1], in range with improvements in this study. Since testing of the skid resistance/crash rate predictions is not yet an option, these assessments cont ribute to the requirement of Coppi X  X  Informational Paradigm fo r external validation. Comfort is taken from the fact that the pr obabilistic profiles [18] show a curve similar to the inductively produced curve in Figure 8. The regression tree method is powerful algorithm that enables analysis of a heterogeneous datase t. With the ability to sidestep the necessity of having specific di stributions patterns that limit some statistical methods, regre ssion trees can be applied across the full domain. In addition, being capable of making numerical predictions allows regression trees to be applied in a  X  X hat if X  data set in our novel extrapolation method to produce a risk profile. The attribute of interest provides the range of values for the x-axis , and the predicted y-value calculates the risk, producing a risk curve across the values of the attribute of interest. Since each variable is controlled, except for the independent variable, the profile approximates a controlled experiment. In investigating the effect of a given attribute in a model, the method of modeling with and without the variable has been found to be ineffective, showing on ly a minor loss of predictive accuracy between the models. A more effective method creates replicates of instances and substi tutes a range of values from the attribute of interest. When the m odel is applied, the corresponding change in value of the target indicates the magnitude of the significance of the va riable of interest. Data mining models capable of analyzing large and complex datasets have been available since the early 1990s, however road research has focused on problems on homogenous road sets, resulting in a lack of understand ing about the interrelationships between road crash and the full set of roadway characteristics. The presence of missing values has further hampered progress. Dynamic methods such as extrapolation have solved both big and small problems. However the regr ession tree and its inherent powers has not been formally matc hed with extrapolation, and thus the problem of performing a road scan in the presence of the large proportion of missing skid re sistance values has never been successfully attempted. This study was able to overcome these issues by using data mining in this new context. This data mining method dem onstrates a decision support methodology to assist road asset managers in the task of identifying both measured high crash roads and potentially dangerous road segments from the whole network, where skid resistance upgrade will reduce the crash risk. The current method of roadway assessment relies on a set of heuristics based on the skid resistance investigatory levels for the various classes of roads, wh ereas our method, based on the historic data, potentially allows each road to be individually assessed and optima lly configured. The model, trained with availabl e roadway data including skid resistance values, is subseque ntly deployed in a novel method combining extrapolation and the regression tree. A skid resistance/crash rate profile and crash rate curve is produced for each crash location, and interrogated to find the optimal skid resistance/crash rate for the road segment without knowing the skid resistance value of the road. Thus, the method provides a solution to the formerly-insurmountable problem of the high proportion of roads without skid resistance data. The internal measures of the method evaluate well, and the components and inductively deduced results genera lly agree well with external measures such as domain know ledge, observed phenomena and probabilistic studies. Future work is required to conso lidate this evidence. New metrics are required to assess the indivi dual skid resistance/crash rate profiles and document the met hod X  X  performance over the whole data set. The models and profiles describe many new relationships that could contribute to knowledge in the road crash domain, including covariate contributions to crash rate, sparking new areas of research. Work on data pre-processing and algorithm selection/configuration is requir ed to improve the accuracy of outcomes, and the latest, improved data should be included. Issues associated with having road netw orks with predominantly high road surface friction for the various classes of roadway require investigation. The real test of success would be demonstrated value in the gradual integration of the method into road asset management practices to support decision making. Potential exists for deployment in smart-vehicle technology for alerting the vehicle/driver to the crash type and risk level of the upcoming road segments. At a broader level, this risk profiling method may be explored to discover critical thresholds in other domains such as finance, insuran ce, engineering, and drug testing.
