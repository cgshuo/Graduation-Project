 Literary studies about the nineteenth-century British novel are often concerned with the nature of the community that surrounds the protagonist. Some theorists have suggested a relationship be-tween the size of a community and the amount of dialogue that occurs, positing that  X  X ace to face time X  diminishes as the number of characters in the novel grows. Others suggest that as the social setting becomes more urbanized, the quality of di-alogue also changes, with more interactions occur-ring in rural communities than urban communities. Such claims have typically been made, however, on the basis of a few novels that are studied in depth. In this paper, we aim to determine whether an automated study of a much larger sample of nineteenth century novels supports these claims.
The research presented here is concerned with the extraction of social networks from literature. We present a method to automatically construct a network based on dialogue interactions between characters in a novel. Our approach includes com-ponents for finding instances of quoted speech, attributing each quote to a character, and iden-tifying when certain characters are in conversa-tion. We then construct a network where char-acters are vertices and edges signify an amount of bilateral conversation between those charac-ters, with edge weights corresponding to the fre-quency and length of their exchanges. In contrast to previous approaches to social network construc-tion, ours relies on a novel combination of pattern-based detection, statistical methods, and adapta-tion of standard natural language tools for the liter-ary genre. We carried out this work on a corpus of 60 nineteenth-century novels and serials, includ-ing 31 authors such as Dickens, Austen and Conan Doyle.

In order to evaluate the literary claims in ques-tion, we compute various characteristics of the dialogue-based social network and stratify these results by categories such as the novel X  X  setting. For example, the density of the network provides evidence about the cohesion of a large or small community, and cliques may indicate a social frag-mentation. Our results surprisingly provide evi-dence that the majority of novels in this time pe-riod do not fit the suggestions provided by liter-ary scholars, and we suggest an alternative expla-nation for our observations of differences across novels.

In the following sections, we survey related work on social networks as well as computational studies of literature. We then present the literary hypotheses in more detail. We describe the meth-ods we use to extract dialogue and construct con-versational networks, along with our approach to analyzing their characteristics. After we present the statistical results, we analyze their significance from a literary perspective. Computer-assisted literary analysis has typically occurred at the word level. This level of granular-ity lends itself to studies of authorial style based on patterns of word use (Burrows, 2004), and re-searchers have successfully  X  X uted X  the writers of anonymous texts by comparing their style to that of a corpus of known authors (Mostellar and Wal-lace, 1984). Determining instances of  X  X ext reuse, X  a type of paraphrasing, is also a form of analysis at the lexical level, and it has recently been used to validate theories about the lineage of ancient texts (Lee, 2007).

Analysis of literature using more semantically-oriented techniques has been rare, most likely be-cause of the difficulty in automatically determin-ing meaningful interpretations. Some exceptions include recent work on learning common event se-quences in news stories (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008), an approach based on statistical methods, and the development of an event calculus for char-acterizing stories written by children (Halpin et al., 2004), a knowledge-based strategy. On the other hand, literary theorists, linguists and others have long developed symbolic but non-computational models for novels. For example, Moretti (2005) has graphically mapped out texts according to ge-ography, social connections and other variables.
While researchers have not attempted the auto-matic construction of social networks represent-ing connections between characters in a corpus of novels, the ACE program has involved entity and relation extraction in unstructured text (Dod-dington et al., 2004). Other recent work in so-cial network construction has explored the use of structured data such as email headers (McCallum et al., 2007) and U.S. Senate bill cosponsorship (Cho and Fowler, 2010). In an analysis of discus-sion forums, Gruzd and Haythornthwaite (2008) explored the use of message text as well as posting data to infer who is talking to whom. In this pa-per, we also explore how to build a network based on conversational interaction, but we analyze the reported dialogue found in novels to determine the links. The kinds of language that is used to signal such information is quite different in the two me-dia. In discussion forums, people tend to use ad-dresses such as  X  X i Tom, X  while in novels, a sys-tem must determine both the speaker of a quota-tion and then the intended recipient of the dialogue act. This is a significantly different problem. It is commonly held that the novel is a literary form which tries to produce an accurate represen-tation of the social world. Within literary stud-ies, the recurring problem is how that represen-tation is achieved. Theories about the relation between novelistic form (the workings of plot, characters, and dialogue, to take the most basic categories) and changes to real-world social mi-lieux abound. Many of these theories center on nineteenth-century European fiction; innovations in novelistic form during this period, as well as the rapid social changes brought about by revolution, industrialization, and transport development, have traditionally been linked. These theories, however, have used only a select few representative novels as proof. By using statistical methods of analy-sis, it is possible to move beyond this small corpus of proof texts. We believe these methods are es-sential to testing the validity of some core theories about social interaction and their representation in literary genres like the novel.

Major versions of the theories about the social worlds of nineteenth-century fiction tend to cen-ter on characters, in two specific ways: how many characters novels tend to have, and how those characters interact with one another. These two  X  X ormal X  facts about novels are usually explained with reference to a novel X  X  setting. From the influ-ential work of the Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin to the present, a consensus emerged that as nov-els are increasingly set in urban areas, the num-ber of characters and the quality of their interac-tion change to suit the setting. Bakhtin X  X  term for this causal relationship was chronotope : the  X  X n-trinsic interconnectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in liter-ature, X  in which  X  X pace becomes charged and re-sponsive to movements of time, plot, and history X  (Bakhtin, 1981, 84). In Bakhtin X  X  analysis, dif-ferent spaces have different social and emotional potentialities, which in turn affect the most basic aspects of a novel X  X  aesthetic technique.

After Bakhtin X  X  invention of the chronotope, much literary criticism and theory devoted itself to filling in, or describing, the qualities of spe-cific chronotopes, particularly those of the village or rural environment and the city or urban en-vironment. Following a suggestion of Bakhtin X  X  that the population of village or rural fictions is modeled on the world of the family, made up of an intimately related set of characters, many crit-ics analyzed the formal expression of this world as constituted by a small set of characters who express themselves conversationally. Raymond Williams used the term  X  X nowable communities X  to describe this world, in which face-to-face rela-tions of a restricted set of characters are the pri-mary mode of social interaction (Williams, 1975, 166).

By contrast, the urban world, in this traditional account, is both larger and more complex. To describe the social-psychological impact of the city, Franco Moretti argues, protagonists of urban novels  X  X hange overnight from  X  X ons X  into  X  X oung men X : their affective ties are no longer vertical ones (between successive generations), but hor-izontal, within the same generation. They are drawn towards those unknown yet congenial faces seen in gardens, or at the theater; future friends, or rivals, or both X  (Moretti, 1999, 65). The re-sult is two-fold: more characters, indeed a mass of characters, and more interactions, although less actual conversation; as literary critic Terry Eagle-ton argues, the city is where  X  X ost of our en-counters consist of seeing rather than speaking, glimpsing each other as objects rather than con-versing as fellow subjects X  (Eagleton, 2005, 145). Moretti argues in similar terms. For him, the difference in number of characters is  X  X ot just a matter of quantity... it X  X  a qualitative, morpho-logical one X  (Moretti, 1999, 68). As the number of characters increases, Moretti argues (following Bakhtin in his logic), social interactions of differ-ent kinds and durations multiply, displacing the family-centered and conversational logic of vil-lage or rural fictions.  X  X he narrative system be-comes complicated, unstable: the city turns into a gigantic roulette table, where helpers and antago-nists mix in unpredictable combinations X  (Moretti, 1999, 68). This argument about how novelistic setting produces different forms of social interac-tion is precisely what our method seeks to evalu-ate.

Our corpus of 60 novels was selected for its rep-resentativeness, particularly in the following cate-gories: authorial (novels from the major canoni-cal authors of the period), historical (novels from each decade), generic (from the major sub-genres of nineteenth-century fiction), sociological (set in rural, urban, and mixed locales), and technical (narrated in first-person and third-person form). The novels, as well as important metadata we as-signed to them (the perspective and setting), are shown in Table 1. We define urban to mean set in a metropolitan zone, characterized by multi-ple forms of labor (not just agricultural). Here, social relations are largely financial or commer-cial in character. We conversely define rural to describe texts that are set in a country or vil-lage zone, where agriculture is the primary activ-ity, and where land-owning, non-productive, rent-collecting gentry are socially predominant. Social relations here are still modeled on feudalism (rela-tions of peasant-lord loyalty and family tie) rather than the commercial cash nexus. We also explored other properties of the texts, such as literary genre, but focus on the results found with setting and per-spective. We obtained electronic encodings of the texts from Project Gutenberg. All told, these texts total more than 10 million words.

We assembled this representative corpus in or-der to test two hypotheses, which are derived from the aforementioned theories: 1. That there is an inverse correlation between 2. That a significant difference in the In order to test these hypotheses, we developed a novel approach to extracting social networks from literary texts themselves, building on exist-ing analysis tools. We defined  X  X ocial network X  as  X  X onversational network X  for purposes of eval-uating these literary theories. In a conversational network, vertices represent characters (assumed to be named entities) and edges indicate at least one instance of dialogue interaction between two char-acters over the course of the novel. The weight of each edge is proportional to the amount of inter-action. We define a conversation as a continuous span of narrative time featuring a set of characters in which the following conditions are met: 1. The characters are in the same place at the 2. The characters take turns speaking; and 3. The characters are mutually aware of each
In the following subsections, we discuss the methods we devised for the three problems in text processing invoked by this approach: identifying the characters present in a literary text, assigning a  X  X peaker X  (if any) to each instance of quoted speech from among those characters, and con-structing a social network by detecting conversa-tions from the set of dialogue acts. 4.1 Character Identification The first challenge was to identify the candi-date speakers by  X  X hunking X  names (such as Mr. Holmes ) from the text. We processed each novel with the Stanford NER tagger (Finkel et al., 2005) and extracted noun phrases that were categorized as persons or organizations. We then clustered the noun phrases into coreferents for the same entity (person or organization). The clustering process is as follows: 1. For each named entity, we generate varia-2. For each named entity, we compile a list of 3. We then match each named entity to the most
We also pre-processed the texts to normalize formatting, detect headings and chapter breaks, re-move metadata, and identify likely instances of quoted speech (that is, mark up spans of text that fall between quotation marks, assumed to be a su-perset of the quoted speech present in the text). 4.2 Quoted Speech Attribution In order to programmatically assign a speaker to each instance of quoted speech, we applied a high-precision subset of a general approach we describe elsewhere (Elson and McKeown, 2010). The first step of this approach was to compile a separate training and testing corpus of literary texts from British, American and Russian authors of the nine-teenth and twentieth centuries. The training cor-pus consisted of about 111,000 words including 3,176 instances of quoted speech. To obtain gold-standard annotations, we conducted an online sur-vey via Amazon X  X  Mechanical Turk program. For each quote, we asked three annotators to indepen-dently choose a speaker from the list of contex-tual candidates X  or, choose  X  X poken by an unlisted character X  if the answer was not available, or  X  X ot spoken by any character X  for non-dialogue cases such as sneer quotes.

We divided this corpus into training and testing sets, and used the training set to develop a catego-rizer that assigned one of five syntactic categories to each quote. For example, if a quote is followed by a verb that indicates verbal expression (such as  X  X aid X ), and then a character mention, a category called Character trigram is assigned to the quote. The fifth category is a catch-all for quotes that do not fall into the other four. In many cases, the an-swer can be reliably determined based solely on its syntactic category. For instance, in the Char-acter trigram category, the mentioned character is the quote X  X  speaker in 99% of both the training and testing sets.

In all, we were able to determine the speaker of 57% of the testing set with 96% accuracy just on the basis of syntactic categorization. This is the technique we used to construct our conversa-tional networks. In another study, we applied ma-chine learning tools to the data (one model for each syntactic category) and achieved an overall accuracy of 83% over the entire test set (Elson and McKeown, 2010). The other 43% of quotes are left here as  X  X nknown X  speakers; however, in the present study, we are interested in conversa-tions rather than individual quotes. Each conversa-tion is likely to consist of multiple quotes by each speaker, increasing the chances of detecting the in-teraction. Moreover, this design decision empha-sizes the precision of the social networks over their recall. This tilts  X  X n favor X  of hypothesis #1 (that there are fewer social interactions in larger com-munities); however, we shall see that despite the emphasis of precision over recall, we identify a sufficient mass of interactions in the texts to con-stitute evidence against this hypothesis. 4.3 Constructing social networks We then applied the results from our character identification and quoted speech attribution meth-ods toward the construction of conversational net-works from literature. We derived one network from each text in our corpus.

We first assigned vertices to character enti-ties that are mentioned repeatedly throughout the novel. Coreferents for the same name (such as Mr. Darcy and Darcy ) were grouped into the same vertex. We found that a network that included in-cidental or single-mention named entities became too noisy to function effectively, so we filtered out the entities that are mentioned fewer than three times in the novel or are responsible for less than 1% of the named entity mentions in the novel.
We assigned undirected edges between vertices that represent adjacency in quoted speech frag-ments. Specifically, we set the weight of each undirected edge between two character vertices to the total length, in words, of all quotes that either character speaks from among all pairs of adjacent quotes in which they both speak X  implying face to face conversation. We empirically determined that the most accurate definition of  X  X djacency X  is one where the two characters X  quotes fall within 300 words of one another with no attributed quotes in between. When such an adjacency is found, the length of the quote is added to the edge weight, under the hypothesis that the significance of the re-lationship between two individuals is proportional to the length of the dialogue that they exchange. Finally, we normalized each edge X  X  weight by the length of the novel.

An example network, automatically constructed in this manner from Jane Austen X  X  Mansfield Park , is shown in Figure 1. The width of each vertex is drawn to be proportional to the character X  X  share of all the named entity mentions in the book (so that protagonists, who are mentioned frequently, appear in larger ovals). The width of each edge is drawn to be proportional to its weight (total con-versation length).

We also experimented with two alternate meth-ods for identifying edges, for purposes of a base-line: 1. The  X  X orrelation X  method divides the text 2. The  X  X poken mention X  method counts occur-Figure 1: Automatically extracted conversation network for Jane Austen X  X  Mansfield Park . 4.4 Evaluation To check the accuracy of our method for extracting conversational networks, we conducted an evalua-tion involving four of the novels ( The Sign of the Four , Emma , David Copperfield and The Portrait of a Lady ). We did not use these texts when devel-oping our method for identifying conversations. For each book, we randomly selected 4-5 chap-ters from among those with significant amounts of quoted speech, so that all excerpts from each novel amounted to at least 10,000 words. We then asked three annotators to identity all the conversa-tions that occur in all 44,000 words. We requested that the annotators include both direct and indi-rect (unquoted) speech, and define  X  X onversation X  as in the beginning of Section 4, but exclude  X  X e-told X  conversations (those that occur within other dialogue).

We processed the annotation results by breaking down each multi-way conversation into all of its unique two-character interactions (for example, a conversation between four people indicates six bi-lateral interactions). To calculate inter-annotator agreement, we first compiled a list of all possi-ble interactions between all characters in each text. In this model, each annotator contributed a set of  X  X es X  or  X  X o X  decisions, one for every character pair. We then applied the kappa measurement for agreement in a binary classification problem (Co-Method Precision Recall F Speech adjacency .95 .51 .67 Correlation .21 .65 .31 Spoken-mention .45 .49 .47 Table 2: Precision, recall, and F-measure of three methods for detecting bilateral conversations in literary texts. hen, 1960). In 95% of character pairs, annota-tors were unanimous, which is a high agreement of k = . 82 .

The precision and recall of our method for de-tecting conversations is shown in Table 2. Preci-sion was .95; this indicates that we can be con-fident in the specificity of the conversational net-works that we automatically construct. Recall was .51, indicating a sensitivity of slightly more than half. There were several reasons that we did not detect the missing links, including indirect speech, quotes attributed to anaphoras or coreferents, and  X  X iffuse X  conversations in which the characters do not speak in turn with one another.

To calculate precision and recall for the two baseline social networks, we set a threshold t to derive a binary prediction from the continuous edge weights. The precision and recall values shown for the baselines in Table 2 represent the highest performance we achieved by varying t be-tween 0 and 1 (maximizing F-measure over t ). Both baselines performed significantly worse in precision and F-measure than our quoted speech adjacency method for detecting conversations. 5.1 Feature extraction We extracted features from the conversational net-works that emphasize the complexity of the social interactions found in each novel: 1. The number of characters and the number of 2. The variance of the distribution of quoted 3. The number of quotes, and proportion of 4. The number of 3-cliques and 4-cliques in the 5. The average degree of the graph, defined as 6. A variation on graph density that normalizes 5.2 Results We derived results from the data in two ways. First, we examined the strengths of the correla-tions between the features that we extracted (for example, between number of character vertices and the average degree of each vertex). We used Pearson X  X  product-moment correlation coefficient in these calculations. Second, we compared the extracted features to the metadata we previously assigned to each text (e.g., urban vs. rural).
Hypothesis #1, which we described in Section 3, claims that there is an inverse correlation be-tween the amount of dialogue in a nineteenth-century novel and the number of characters in that novel. We did not find this to be the case. Rather, we found a weak but positive correlation (r=.16) between the number of quotes in a novel and the number of characters (normalizing the quote count for text length). There was a stronger pos-itive correlation (r=.50) between the number of unique speakers (those characters who speak at least once) and the normalized number of quotes, suggesting that larger networks have more conver-sations than smaller ones. But because the first correlation is weak, we investigated whether fur-ther analysis could identify other evidence that confirms or contradicts the hypothesis.

Another way to interpret hypothesis #1 is that social networks with more characters tend to break apart and be less connected. However, we found the opposite to be true. The correlation between the number of characters in each graph and the av-erage degree (number of conversation partners) for each character was a positive, moderately strong r=.42. This is not a given; a network can easily, for example, break into minimally connected or mutu-ally exclusive subnetworks when more characters are involved. Instead, we found that networks tend to stay close-knit regardless of their size: even the density of the graph (the percentage of the com-munity that each character talks to) grows with the total population size at r=.30. Moreover, as the population of speakers grows, the density is likely to increase at r=.49. A higher number of characters (speaking or non-speaking) is also cor-related with a higher rate of 3-cliques per charac-ter (r=.38), as well as with a more balanced dis-tribution of dialogue (the share of dialogue spo-ken by the top three speakers decreases at r=  X  .61). This evidence suggests that in nineteenth-century British literature, it is the small communities, rather than the large ones, that tend to be discon-nected.

Hypothesis #2, meanwhile, posited that a novel X  X  setting (urban or rural) would have an ef-fect on the structure of its social network. After defining  X  X ocial network X  as a conversational net-work, we did not find this to be the case. Sur-prisingly, the numbers of characters and speakers found in the urban novel were not significantly greater than those found in the rural novel. More-over, each of the features we extracted, such as the rate of cliques, average degree, density, and rate of characters X  mentions of other characters, did not change in a statistically significant man-ner between the two genres. For example, Figure 2 shows the mean over all texts of each network X  X  average degree, with confidence intervals, sepa-rated by setting into urban and rural. The increase in degree seen in urban texts is not significant.
Rather, the only type of metadata variable that did impact the average degree with any signifi-cance was the text X  X  perspective. Figure 2 also sep-arates texts into first-and third-person tellings and shows the means and confidence intervals for the Figure 2: The average degree for each character as a function of the novel X  X  setting and its perspec-tive. Figure 3: Conversational networks for first-person novels like Collins X  X  The Woman in White are less connected due to the structure imposed by the per-spective. average degree measure. Stories told in the third person had much more connected networks than stories told in the first person: not only did the av-erage degree increase with statistical significance (by the homoscedastic t-test to p&lt;. 005 ), so too did the graph density ( p&lt;. 05 ) and the rate of 3-cliques per character ( p&lt;. 05 ).

We believe the reason for this can be intuited with a visual inspection of a first-person graph. Figure 3 shows the conversational network ex-tracted for Collins X  X  The Woman in White , which is told in the first person. Not surprisingly, the most oft-repeated named entity in the text is I , referring to the narrator. More surprising is the lack of con-versation connections between the auxiliary char-acters. The story X  X  structure revolves around the narrator and each character is understood in terms of his or her relationship to the narrator. Private conversations between auxiliary characters would not include the narrator, and thus do not appear in a first-hand account. An  X  X mniscient X  third person narrator, by contrast, can eavesdrop on any pair of characters conversing. This highlights the im-portance of detecting reported and indirect speech in future work, as a first-person narrator may hear about other connections without witnessing them. Our data, therefore, markedly do not confirm hy-pothesis #1. They also suggest, in relation to hy-pothesis #2 (also not confirmed by the data), a strong reason why.

One of the basic assumptions behind hypoth-esis #2 X  that urban novels contain more charac-ters, mirroring the masses of nineteenth-century cities X  is not borne out by our data. Our results do, however, strongly correlate a point of view (third-person narration) with more frequently connected characters, implying tighter and more talkative so-cial networks.

We would propose that this suggests that the form of a given novel X  the standpoint of the nar-rative voice, whether the voice is  X  X mniscient X  or not X  is far more determinative of the kind of so-cial network described in the novel than where it is set or even the number of characters involved. Whereas standard accounts of nineteenth-century fiction, following Bakhtin X  X  notion of the  X  X hrono-tope, X  emphasize the content of the novel as de-terminative (where it is set, whether the novel fits within a genre of  X  X illage X  or  X  X rban X  fiction), we have found that content to be surprisingly ir-relevant to the shape of social networks within. Bakhtin X  X  influential theory, and its detailed re-workings by Williams, Moretti, and others, sug-gests that as the novel becomes more urban, more centered in (and interested in) populous urban set-tings, the novel X  X  form changes to accommodate the looser, more populated, less conversational networks of city life. Our data suggests the op-posite: that the  X  X rban novel X  is not as strongly distinctive a form as has been asserted, and that in fact it can look much like the village fictions of the century, as long as the same method of narration is used.

This conclusion leads to some further consider-ations. We are suggesting that the important ele-ment of social networks in nineteenth-century fic-tion is not where the networks are set, but from what standpoint they are imagined or narrated. Narrative voice, that is, trumps setting. In this paper, we presented a method for char-acterizing a text of literary fiction by extracting the network of social conversations that occur be-tween its characters. This allowed us to take a systematic and wide look at a large corpus of texts, an approach which complements the nar-rower and deeper analysis performed by literary scholars and can provide evidence for or against some of their claims. In particular, we described a high-precision method for detecting face-to-face conversations between two named characters in a novel, and showed that as the number of charac-ters in a novel grows, so too do the cohesion, in-terconnectedness and balance of their social net-work. In addition, we showed that the form of the novel (first-or third-person) is a stronger predictor of these features than the setting (urban or rural). Our results thus far suggest further review of our methods, our corpus and our results for more in-sights into the social networks found in this and other genres of fiction.
