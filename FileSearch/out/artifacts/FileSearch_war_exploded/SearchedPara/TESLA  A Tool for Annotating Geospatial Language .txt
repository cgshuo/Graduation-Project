 We are interested in geospatial language under-standing  X  the understanding of natural language (NL) descriptions of spatial locations, orientation, movement and paths that are grounded in the real world. Such algorithms would enable a number of applications, including automated geotagging of text and speech, robots that can follow human route in-structions, and NL-description based localization.
To aide development of training and testing cor-pora for this area, we have built The gEoSpa-tial Language Annotator (TESLA) X  X  tool which supports the visualization and hand-annotation of both text and speech-based geospatial language cor-pora. TESLA can be used to create a gold-standard for training and testing geospatial language under-standing algorithms by allowing the user to anno-tate geospatial references with object (e.g., streets, businesses, and parks) and latitude and longitude (lat/lon) coordinates. An integrated search capa-bility to a GIS database with results presented in Google Earth allow the human annotator to eas-ily annotate geospatial references with ground truth. Furthermore, TESLA supports the playback of GPS tracks of multiple objects for corpora associated with synchronized speaker or object movement, al-lowing the annotator to take this positional context into account. TESLA is currently being used to an-notate a corpus of first-person, spoken path descrip-tions of car routes.

In this paper, we first briefly describe the corpus that we are annotating, which provides a grounded example of using TESLA. We then discuss the TESLA annotation tool and its use in annotating that corpus. Finally, we describe related work and our plans for future work. The PURSUIT Corpus (Blaylock and Allen, 2008) is a collection of speech data in which subjects de-scribe their path in real time (i.e., while they are trav-eling it) and a GPS receiver simultaneously records the actual paths taken. (These GPS tracks of the actual path can aide the annotator in determining what geospatial entities and events were meant by the speaker X  X  description.)
Figure 1 shows an example of the experimental setup for the corpus collection. Each session con-sisted of a lead car and a follow car. The driver of the lead car was instructed to drive wherever he wanted for an approximate amount of time (around 15 min-utes). The driver of the follow car was instructed to follow the lead car. One person in the lead car (usu-ally a passenger) and one person in the follow car (usually the driver) were given close-speaking head-set microphones and instructed to describe, during the ride, where the lead car was going, as if they were speaking to someone in a remote location who was trying to follow the car on a map. The speak-ers were also instructed to try to be verbose, and that they did not need to restrict themselves to street names X  X hey could use businesses, landmarks, or whatever was natural. Both speakers X  speech was recorded during the session. In addition, a GPS re-ceiver was placed in each car and the GPS track was recorded at a high sampling rate. The corpus con-sists of 13 audio recordings 1 of seven paths along with the corresponding GPS tracks. The average session length was 19 minutes. TESLA is an extensible tool for geospatial language annotation and visualization. It is built on the NXT Toolkit (Carletta et al., 2003) and data model (Car-letta et al., 2005) and uses Google Earth for visu-alization. It supports geospatial entity search using the TerraFly GIS database (Rishe et al., 2005). Cur-rently, TESLA supports annotation of geospatial lo-cation referring expressions, but is designed to be easily extended to other annotation tasks for geospa-tial language corpora. (Our plans for extensions are described in Section 6.)
Figure 2 shows a screenshot of the main view in the TESLA annotator, showing a session of the PURSUIT Corpus. In the top-left corner is a wid-get with playback controls for the session. This pro-vides synchronized playback of the speech and GPS tracks. When the session is playing, audio from a single speaker (lead or follow) is played back, and the blue car icon in the Google Earth window on the right moves in synchronized fashion. Although this Google Earth playback is somewhat analogous to a video of the movement, Google Earth remains us-able and the user can move the display or zoom in and out as desired. If location annotations have pre-viously been made, these pop up at the given lat/lon as they are mentioned in the audio, allowing the an-notator to verify that the location has been correctly annotated. In the center, on the left-hand side is a display of the audio transcription, which also moves in sync with the audio and Google Earth visualiza-tion. The user creates an annotation by highlighting a group of words, and choosing the appropriate type of annotation. The currently selected annotation ap-pears to the right where the corresponding geospatial entity information (e.g., name, address, lat/lon) can be entered by hand, or by searching for the entity in a GIS database. 3.1 GIS Search and Visualization In addition to allowing information on annotated geospatial entities to be entered by hand, TESLA also supports search with a GIS database. Cur-rently, TESLA supports search queries to the Ter-raFly database (Rishe et al., 2005), although other databases could be easily added. TerraFly contains a large aggregation of GIS data from major distrib-utors including NavTeq and Tiger streets and roads, 12 million U.S. Businesses through Yellow Pages, and other various freely available geospatial data. It supports keyword searches on database fields as well as radius-bounded searches from a given point. TESLA, by default, uses the position of the GPS track of the car at the time of the utterance as the center for search queries, although any point can be chosen.
 Search results are shown to the user in Google Earth as illustrated in Figure 3. This figure shows the result of searching for intersections with the key-word  X  X omana X . The annotator can then select one of the search results, which will automatically pop-ulate the geospatial entity information for that an-notation. Such visualization is important in geospa-tial language annotation, as it allows the annotator to verify that the correct entity is chosen. To illustrate the use of TESLA, we briefly describe our current annotation efforts on the PURSUIT Cor-pus. We are currently involved in annotating refer-ring expressions to locations in the corpus, although later work will involve annotating movement and orientation descriptions as well.

Location references can occur in a number of syn-tactic forms, including proper nouns ( Waffle House ), definite ( the street ) and indefinite ( a park ) refer-ences, and often, complex noun phrases ( one of the historic churches of Pensacola ). Regardless of its syntactic form, we annotate all references to loca-tions in the corpus that correspond to types found in our GIS database. References to such things as fields, parking lots, and fire hydrants are not anno-tated, as our database does not contain these types of entities. (Although, with access to certain local government resources or advanced computer vision systems, these references could be resolved as well.) In PURSUIT, we markup the entire noun phrase (as opposed to e.g., the head word) and annotate that grouping.

Rather than annotate a location reference with just latitude and longitude coordinates, we annotate it with the geospatial entity being referred to, such as a street or a business. The reasons for this are twofold: first, lat/lon coordinates are real numbers, and it would be difficult to guarantee that each ref-erence to the same entity was marked with the same coordinates (e.g., to identify coreference). Secondly, targeting the entity allows us to include more infor-mation about that entity (as detailed below).
In the corpus, we have found four types of en-tities that are references, which are also in our database: streets, intersections, addresses (e.g., 127 Main Street), and other points (a catch-all category containing other point-like entities such as busi-nesses, parks, bridges, etc.)
An annotation example is shown in Figure 4, in which the utterance contains references to two streets and an intersection. Here the intersection re-ferring expression spans two referring expressions to streets, and each is annotated with a canonical name as well as lat/lon coordinates. Note also that our annotation schema allows us to annotate embedded references (here the streets within the intersection). The SpatialML module for the Callisto annotator (Mani et al., 2008) was designed for human anno-tation of geospatial locations with ground truth by looking up targets in a gazetteer. It does not, how-ever, have a geographic visualization components such as Google Earth and does not support GPS track playback.

The TAME annotator (Leidner, 2004) is a simi-lar tool, supporting hand annotation of toponym ref-erences by gazetteer lookup. It too does not, as far as we are aware, have a visualization compo-nent nor GPS track information, likely because the level of geospatial entities being looked at were at the city/state/country level. The PURSUIT Corpus mostly contains references to geospatial entities at a sub-city level, which may introduce more uncer-tainty as to the intended referent. In this paper, we have presented TESLA X  X  gen-eral human annotation tool for geospatial language. TESLA uses a GIS database, GPS tracks, and Google Earth to allow a user to annotate refer-ences to geospatial entities. We also discussed how TESLA is being used to annotate a corpus of spoken path descriptions.
 Though currently we are only annotating PUR-SUIT with location references, future plans in-clude extending TESLA to support the annotation of movement, orientation, and path descriptions. We also plan to use this corpus as test and training data for algorithms to automatically annotate such infor-mation.
 Finally, the path descriptions in the PURSUIT Corpus were all done from a first-person, ground-level perspective. As TESLA allows us to replay the actual routes from GPS tracks within Google Earth, we believe we could use this tool to gather more spo-ken descriptions of the paths from an aerial perspec-tive from different subjects. This would give us sev-eral more versions of descriptions of the same path and allow the comparison of descriptions from the two different perspectives.
