 We present an interactive multi-document summa-rization system called SciSumm that summarizes document collections that are composed of lists of papers cited together within the same source arti-cle, otherwise known as a co-citation. The inter-active nature of the summarization approach makes this demo session ideal for its presentation.
When users interact with SciSumm, they request summaries in context as they read, and that context determines the focus of the summary generated for a set of related scientific articles. This behaviour is different from some other non-interactive summa-rization systems that might appear as a black box and might not tailor the result to the specific infor-mation needs of the users in context. SciSumm cap-tures a user X  X  contextual needs when a user clicks on a co-citation. Using the context of the co-citation in the source article, we generate a query that allows us to create a summary in a query-oriented fash-ion. The extracted portions of the co-cited articles are then assembled into clusters that represent the main themes of the articles that relate to the context in which they were cited. Our evaluation demon-strates that SciSumm achieves higher quality sum-maries than a state-of-the-art multidocument sum-marization system (Radev, 2004).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first describe the design goals for SciSumm in 2 to motivate the need for the system and its usefulness. The end-to-end summarization pipeline has been de-scribed in Section 3. Section 4 presents an evalua-tion of summaries generated from the system. We present an overview of relevant literature in Section 5. We end the paper with conclusions and some in-teresting further research directions in Section 6. Consider that as a researcher reads a scientific arti-cle, she/he encounters numerous citations, most of them citing the foundational and seminal work that is important in that scientific domain. The text sur-rounding these citations is a valuable resource as it allows the author to make a statement about her viewpoint towards the cited articles. However, to re-searchers who are new to the field, or sometimes just as a side-effect of not being completely up-to-date with related work in a domain, these citations may pose a challenge to readers. A system that could generate a small summary of the collection of cited articles that is constructed specifically to relate to the claims made by the author citing them would be incredibly useful. It would also help the researcher determine if the cited work is relevant for her own research.

As an example of such a co-citation consider the following citation sentence:
Various machine learning approaches have been proposed for chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Tjong Kim Sang, 2000a; Tjong Kim Sang et al. , 2000; Tjong Kim Sang, 2000b; Sassano and Utsuro, 2000; van Halteren, 2000) .

Now imagine the reader trying to determine about widely used machine learning approaches for noun phrase chunking . He would probably be required to go through these cited papers to understand what is similar and different in the variety of chunking approaches. Instead of going through these individ-ual papers, it would be quicker if the user could get the summary of the topics in all those papers that talk about the usage of machine learning methods in chunking . SciSumm aims to automatically dis-cover these points of comparison between the co-cited papers by taking into consideration the con-textual needs of a user. When the user clicks on a co-citation in context, the system uses the text sur-rounding that co-citation as evidence of the informa-tion need. A high level overview of our system X  X  architecture is presented in Figure 1. The system provides a web based interface for viewing and summarizing re-search articles in the ACL Anthology corpus, 2008. The summarization proceeds in three main stages as follows:  X  A user may retrieve a collection of articles  X  A user can use the title, snippet summary and  X  If a user clicks on one, SciSumm responds by An example of a summary for a particular topic is displayed in Figure 2. This figure shows one of the clusters generated for the citation sentence  X  X ar-ious machine learning approaches have been pro-posed for chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Tjong Kim Sang, 2000a; Tjong Kim Sang et al. , 2000; Tjong Kim Sang, 2000b; Sassano and Utsuro, 2000; van Halteren, 2000) X . The cluster has a la-bel Chunk, Tag, Word and contains fragments from two of the papers discussing this topic. A ranked list of such clusters is generated, which allows for swift navigation between topics of interest for a user (Figure 3). This summary is tremendously useful as it informs the user of the different perspectives of co-cited authors towards a shared problem (in this case  X  X hunking X ). More specifically, it informs the user as to how different or similar approaches are that were used for this research problem (which is  X  X hunking X ). 3.1 System Description SciSumm has four primary modules that are central to the functionality of the system, as displayed in Figure 1. First, the Text Tiling module takes care of obtaining tiles of text relevant to the citation con-text. Next, the clustering module is used to generate labelled clusters using the text tiles extracted from the co-cited papers. The clusters are ordered accord-ing to relevance with respect to the generated query. This is accomplished by the Ranking Module.

In the following sections, we discuss each of the main modules in detail. 3.2 Texttiling The Text Tiling module uses the TextTiling algo-rithm (Hearst, 1997) for segmenting the text of each article. We have used text tiles as the basic unit for our summary since individual sentences are too short to stand on their own. This happens as a side-effect of the length of scientific articles. Sentences picked from different parts of several articles assem-bled together would make an incoherent summary. Once computed, text tiles are used to expand on the content viewed within the context associated with a co-citation. The intuition is that an embedded co-citation in a text tile is connected with the topic dis-tribution of its context. Thus, we can use a computa-tion of similarity between tiles and the context of the co-citation to rank clusters generated using Frequent Term based text clustering. 3.3 Frequent Term Based Clustering The clustering module employs Frequent Term Based Clustering (Beil et al., 2002). For each co-citation, we use this clustering technique to cluster all the of the extracted text tiles generated by seg-menting each of the co-cited papers. We settled on this clustering approach for the following reasons:  X  Text tile contents coming from different papers  X  Frequent Term based clustering is extremely  X  A frequent term set is generated for each clus-
Frequent Term Based text clustering uses a group of frequently co-occurring terms called a frequent term set. We use a measure of entropy to rank these frequent term sets. Frequent term sets provide a clean clustering that is determined by specifying the number of overlapping documents containing more than one frequent term set. The algorithm uses the first k term sets if all the documents in the document collection are clustered. To discover all the possi-ble candidates for clustering, i.e., term sets, we used the Apriori algorithm (Agrawal et al., 1994), which identifies the sets of terms that are both relatively frequent and highly correlated with one another. 3.4 Cluster Ranking The ranking module uses cosine similarity between the query and the centroid of each cluster to rank all the clusters generated by the clustering module. The context of a co-citation is restricted to the text of the segment in which the co-citation is found. In this way we attempt to leverage the expert knowledge of the author as it is encoded in the local context of the co-citation. We have taken great care in the design of the evalu-ation for the SciSumm summarization system. In a typical evaluation of a multi-document summariza-tion system, gold standard summaries are created by hand and then compared against fixed length gen-erated summaries. It was necessary to prepare our own evaluation corpus, consisting of gold standard summaries created for a randomly selected set of co-citations because such an evaluation corpus does not exist for this task. 4.1 Experimental Setup An important target user population for multi-document summarization of scientific articles is graduate students. Hence to get a measure of how well the summarization system is performing, we asked 2 graduate students who have been working in the computational linguistics community to create gold standard summaries of a fixed length (8 sen-tences  X  200 words) for 10 randomly selected co-citations. We obtained two different gold standard summaries for each co-citation (i.e., 20 gold stan-dard summaries total). Our evaluation is designed to measure the quality of the content selection. In future work, we will evaluate the usability of the SciSumm system using a task based evaluation.
In the absence of any other multi-document sum-marization system in the domain of scientific ar-ticle summarization, we used a widely used and freely available multi-document summarization sys-tem called MEAD (Radev, 2004) as our baseline. MEAD uses centroid based summarization to cre-ate informative clusters of topics. We use the de-fault configuration of MEAD in which MEAD uses length, position and centroid for ranking each sen-tence. We did not use query focussed summarization with MEAD. We evaluate its performance with the same gold standard summaries we use to evaluate SciSumm. For generating a summary from our sys-tem we used sentences from the tiles that are clus-tered in the top ranked cluster. Once all of the ex-tracts included in that entire cluster are exhausted, we move on to the next highly ranked cluster. In this way we prepare a summary comprising of 8 highly relevant sentences. 4.2 Results For measuring performance of the two summariza-tion systems (SciSumm and MEAD), we compute the ROUGE metric based on the 2 * 10 gold standard summaries that were manually created. ROUGE has been traditionally used to compute the performance based on the N-gram overlap (ROUGE-N) between the summaries generated by the system and the tar-get gold standard summaries. For our evaluation we used two different versions of the ROUGE met-ric, namely ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2, which corre-spond to measures of the unigram and bigram over-lap respectively. We computed four metrics in order to get a complete picture of how SciSumm performs in relation to the baseline, namely ROUGE-1 F-measure, ROUGE-1 Recall, ROUGE-2 F-measure, and ROUGE-2 Recall.

From the results presented in Figure 4 and 5, we can see that our system performs well on average in comparison to the baseline. Especially important is the performance of the system on recall measures, which shows the most dramatic advantage over the baseline. To measure the statistical significance of this result, we carried out a Student T-Test, the re-sults of which are presented in the results section in Table 1. It is apparent from the p-values gener-ated by T-Test that our system performs significantly better than MEAD on three of the metrics on which both the systems were evaluated using ( p &lt; 0 . 05) as the criterion for statistical significance. This sup-ports the view that summaries perceived as higher in value are generated using a query focused technique, where the query is generated automatically from the context of the co-citation. Surprisingly, not many approaches to the problem of summarization of scientific articles have been pro-posed in the past. Qazvinian et al. (2008) present a summarization approach that can be seen as the converse of what we are working to achieve. Rather than summarizing multiple papers cited in the same source article, they summarize different viewpoints expressed towards the same paper from different pa-pers that cite it. Nanba et al. (1999) argue in their work that a co-citation frequently implies a consis-tent viewpoint towards the cited articles. Another approach that uses bibliographic coupling has been used for gathering different viewpoints from which to summarize a document (Kaplan et al., 2008). In our work we make use of this insight by generating a query to focus our multi-document summary from the text closest to the citation. In this demo, we present SciSumm, which is an in-teractive multi-document summarization system for scientific articles. Our evaluation shows that the SciSumm approach to content selection outperforms another widely used multi-document summarization system for this summarization task.

Our long term goal is to expand the capabilities of SciSumm to generate literature surveys of larger document collections from less focused queries. This more challenging task would require more con-trol over filtering and ranking in order to avoid gen-erating summaries that lack focus. To this end, a future improvement that we plan to use is a vari-ant on MMR (Maximum Marginal Relevance) (Car-bonell et al., 1998), which can be used to optimize the diversity of selected text tiles as well as the rel-evance based ordering of clusters, i.e., so that more diverse sets of extracts from the co-cited articles will be placed at the ready fingertips of users.

Another important direction is to refine the inter-action design through task-based user studies. As we collect more feedback from students and re-searchers through this process, we will used the in-sights gained to achieve a more robust and effective implementation.
