 This work deals with the task of predicting the popularity of user-generated content. We demonstrate how the novelty of newly published content plays an important role in affecting its popularity. We study three dimensions of novelty: con-temporaneous novelty , self novelty ,and discussion novelty . We demonstrate the contribution of the new novelty mea-sures to estimating blog-post popularity by predicting the number of comments expected for a fresh post. We further demonstrate how novelty based measures can be utilized for predicting the citation volume of academic papers.
Recent years have witnessed a tremendous increase in the amount of user-generated content (UGC) available on the web. Many social media (Web 2.0) applications have emerged to provide an open stage for users to contribute content and to publicly share their ideas and opinions with others. The most notable source for UGC on the web nowa-days is the Blogoshpere , where blogging web services have become popular media for personal content publication.
As the popularity of social media services increases, iden-tifying UGC with high  X  X uality X  becomes more difficult due to the enormous amount of new content that is continu-ally published on those sites. Typically, due to the large amounts of data, only a small fraction of new posts are ex-pected to gain popularity. Consequently, only a few posts will be read, commented, or rated by others, while most of the posts will be ignored. Mishne and Glance [11] revealed that only 15% of the blog posts are commented on, with an average of two comments per post. They noted that the number of comments per post follows a power-law distribu-tion, with a small number of posts containing a high number of comments and a long tail of posts with only a few or no comments at all. Therefore, it is extremely important for blog services to be able to identify the sporadic  X  X ood X  posts to be recommended for their users.

The quality of UGC is usually measured in several dimen-sions such as the author X  X  reputation, objectivity, and reli-ability, as well as content relevancy, completeness, and ac-curacy [4]. The most successful indicators for UGC quality are the amount of user feedback and the number of citations the content has [11, 9, 14]. These approaches usually rely on explicit and publicly available feedback such as comments, ratings, recommendations, and tagging [9, 14], as well as implicit feedback such as click-through data. Content-based features such as writing style and missing spelling errors can additionally be used for quality analysis [1].

User feedback is indeed very valuable for identifying high quality content. However, there still remains a fundamental gap in evaluation of UGC quality when no feedback is avail-able, especially for freshly published content. When user feedback does not exist, evaluation approaches are mostly based on the author X  X  reputation, as reflected by the popu-larity of the author X  X  previous content contributions [9, 14]. However, such methods are strongly biased to popular con-tributors in the past, and underestimate fresh content pub-lished by unfamiliar contributors.

In this work we deal with the task of predicting UGC pop-ularity, as reflected by the amount of expected user feedback, focusing on new content (post) that has not yet received feedback. We address a new dimension for content quality evaluation based on measuring the novelty of the published content and demonstrate how the novelty of a new post plays an important role in affecting its popularity. More specifi-cally,westudythreedimensionsofnoveltytypes: Thefirst type, termed contemporaneous novelty ,modelstherelative novelty embedded in new post with respect to contemporary content generated by others in the same time period. The second type of novelty, termed self novelty ,modelstherel-ative novelty embedded in new UGC with respect to the user X  X  own contribution history. The third novelty type, termed discussion novelty , relates to the novelty of the com-ments associated by readers with respect to the post X  X  orig-inal content. These novelty-based features do not require existing user feedback therefore they can enhance existing popularity estimation techniques for new posts, which are currently based primarily on the author X  X  reputation and on textual analysis. Furthermore, the contemporaneous novelty feature can even be used to predict the popularity of new posts provided by unfamiliar contributors with no history at all. Such an estimation of fresh content quality, prior to the availability of any user feedback is of extreme importance, e.g., for purposes of commercial marketing campaigns in the blogosphere.

Using two real-world data sets of blogs and academic pa-pers, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the novelty mea-sures described in this work in assisting with the task of estimating the number of comments expected for new posts.
Several recent works studied the reasons why users con-tribute content and participate in online discussions (e.g., [12, 6]). Chai et al. [4] provide a comprehensive survey on various content quality characteristics that were already considered in the literature, which can be used to estimate the quality of social media content. Several works tried to use similar features to predict the quality of UGC and its popularity [11, 9, 14]. Mishne and Glance [11] showed that blog popularity is highly correlated with the volume of blog comments. Hsu et. al. [9] predicted the popularity of Digg comments and Tsagkias et al. [14] addressed a similar pre-diction task for on-line news.

Focusing on a similar prediction task [9, 14], our work shows how novelty factors can assist in predicting the ex-pected volume of comments for a new UGC, in the absence of user feedback. Novelty detection has been the focus of several IR studies [13]. Most detection approaches are based on measuring the dissimilarity between new content to pre-viously published content.
 Predicting the number of expected comments for a given UGC has some characteristics in common with predicting the volume of academic paper citations. This task was stud-ied intensively in the 2003 KDD Cup [8]. Furthermore, Castillo et al. [3] estimated the number of expected cita-tions based on the paper authors X  reputations. Dietz et al. [7] also considered the paper content and the topic flows be-tween papers using an extension of the LDA model. In this paper we further demonstrate how the novelty features de-veloped for the UGC comment prediction task are beneficial for predicting the volume of academic paper citations.
A related task in the music domain was recently studied by Bischoff et al. [2]. This work introduced a new method for predicting the potential of music tracks to become hits. Following the results of our work, it will be interesting to explore the relations between novelty and music popularity.
Let U = { u 1 ,u 2 ,...,u n } be a set of n sources of UGC, where each source u  X  U is modeled as a stream of user con-tributed content updates, termed hereinafter as posts . Such content is usually contributed by the same author, or a com-munity of authors who post updates on the same source, e.g., a blog on the same topic. Let p u denote a single post pub-lished on source u . We assume each post p u has a timestamp t ( p u ) that captures its publication time.

Each post can further have zero to many comments from its readers 1 . We denote the sequence of comments to a post p u by C ( p u )= { c 1 ,...,c k } , where each comment c i

Other types of user feedback (ratings, tags, citations) can be used for that purpose similar to the source comments. own publication time t ( c i ). Obviously, the publication time for any comment c  X  C ( p u )satisfies t ( c )  X  t ( p u ).
We now define three sets that will be used later on to derive the proposed novelty-based features.

Self-novelty set :Givenapost p u , we define SN ( p u ,T ) to be the set of all posts that were published on the same source u previous to post p u , within a given time window
Contemporaneous-novelty set :Givenapost p u ,and a time window T , we define CN ( p u ,T )tobethesetofall posts p u that were contemporary published with post p u on other sources within the time window T :

We measure the novelty of a single source-post over three contextual dimensions, which we hypothesize as contribut-ing to predicting its popularity. Many novelty measures have been proposed over the years, most are based on measuring dissimilarity of the new content from previously published content [13]. In this work we utilize a distance measure that is derived from informati on theory, known as the normal-ized compression distance ( NCD ), suggested (and was given a formal justification) by Cilibrasi et al. [5].

Given a compressor M and two strings x and y ,the NCD is defined as: where M ( x ), M ( y )and M ( xy ) are the bitwise sizes of the resulting sequences when using M to compress x , y ,andthe concatenation of x and y , respectively. In this work, we used the 7ZA-compression algorithm as our choice for M , due to its ability to utilize a large buffer which is well suited for large text.

NCD estimates the distance between two text strings by measuring the improvement achieved by compressing one string using the information found in the other string. It has been proved to serve as an approximation of Kolmogorov complexity [5].
We measure novelty along three contextual dimensions, coined self novelty, contemporaneous novelty, and discussion novelty.

Self novelty : This measure models the relative novelty of a new post with respect to previous posts published on the same source. We hypothesize that self-novelty contributes to post popularity, probably due to the fact that authors who fail to innovate and to  X  X urprise X  their readers, lose their popularity over time. Given a post p u of some source u  X  U and a time window T s ;let SN ( p u ,T s ) be the corresponding self-novelty set. The self-novelty of post p u with respect to SN ( p u ,T s )isgivenby: where p u represents the content of the given post and concat ( SN ( p u ,T s )) is the concatenation of all post contents in the SN set.

Contemporaneous novelty : This measure evaluates the novel contribution of a single source-post with respect to other posts submitted in the same time period. We hypoth-esize that non-novel source-posts are less popular as they fail to explore new valuable information for their readers. Given a post p u of some source u  X  U , and a time window T ;let CN ( p u ,T c ) be the corresponding contemporaneous-novelty set. The contemporaneous novelty of post p u with respect to CN ( p u ,T c )isgivenby:
Discussion novelty : This measures relates to the nov-elty of the comments associated by readers with previous posts on the same source. The comments of each previous post are compared to the original post content to measure their novelty in terms of the amount of information they add to the original post. The intuition behinds this measure is that a new post on a source with high discussion novelty, is more likely to initiate an interesting fruitful discussion that will affect the post X  X  popularity.

Given a post p u of some source u  X  U .Let b = { p u  X  u | t ( p discussion novelty of p u is measured by the average novelty of comments on previous posts on the same source: nov d ( p u )= 1 where | b | represents the number of previous posts on u ,and concat ( DN ( p to post p u that were given prior to publication time of p
We collected data from an internal IBM blogging sys-tem [10]. We obtained a total of 42,502 blog posts written by 4,416 unique bloggers. The number of posts per blog has a power-law distribution with a power factor k =  X  1 . (
R 2 =0 . 89). We extracted several features from each blog post to be used by the popularity predictor: the post X  X  raw text, the time and date of its publication, the number of comments it received as well as the comments X  raw text and publication time, the number of tags the post was tagged with as well as its average rating value. We further mea-sured (average and standard deviation) the relative activity (relative publication rate) of the blog X  X  author.
We measured blog post X  X  popularity as the total number of comments it received until the time we obtained the dataset, as in [11, 9, 14]. The number of comments per blog post in our dataset is power-lawed (similar to what was shown in [11]) with a power factor k =  X  2 . 55 ( R 2 =0 . 95).
Our goal is to predict whether a new blog post would receive a total of N or more comments in the future by learning a predictor that is based on both traditional and novelty based features. We used a Linear Regression clas-sifier which separates blog posts with N or more comments from all other posts. Given a new blog post, the predictor will then classify it into either of the two classes. The clas-sifier was trained using the given blog data. Ten-fold cross validation was used to reduce the chance of over-fitting. The accuracy of prediction was measured by the area under the corresponding ROC curve. The ROC curve shows how well items with N or more comments can be identified, by plot-ting the true positive classification rate as a function of the false positive rate. Since the classifier predicts the number of comments per post directly it can additionally be evaluated by the Spearman X  X - X  regression coefficient which measures prediction quality by the correlation between the ranking of the posts according to their  X  X rue X  number of comments and the ranking of the posts according to their predicted number of comments.
We analyzed the contribution of the proposed novelty-based features over the remain ing features to the accuracy of the prediction. We split the training blogs into three groups according to the length of their posting history: short (with 1 X 5 posts), moderate (with 6 X 10 posts) and long (with 11+ posts). We learned three predi ctors for each set: the first one with only the novelty-based features, the second with only the traditional blog and post features, and the third with all features together. The predictor X  X  task was to identify posts with at least 10 comments. For the novelty-based features we set T s (the self-novelty time window) to 120 days, and T c (the contemporaneous-novelty time window) to 10 days. TheresultsaregiveninTable1. Wecanobservethatcon-sidering only the novelty-based features for prediction leads to poor prediction accuracy, and the best strategy is to com-bine all features together. The proposed novelty-based fea-tures add significant gain to the overall performance of the predictors. This is most evident for blogs with short history. The contribution of the novelty-based features for blogs with moderate and long histories is smaller but still significant. This reduction in gain is expected because a long history provides enough evidence for the blog X  X  popularity, hence novelty-based features are less significant for prediction.
Table 2 further shows for each threshold value ( N ), the fraction of blog posts with at least this number of comments, and the area under the ROC curve of the linear regression predictor. Note that for N  X  1 the predictor also predicts no comments at all. Interestingly, it is easier to identify blog posts with many expected comments than to distin-guish between blog posts with no comments to those posts which will have at least one comment. We attribute this to the fact that most blog posts that receive many comments tend to come from blogs which have a persistent following over time, thus are easier to be identified.
Finally, we identified the most influential features used by the predictor by normaliz ing each feature to zero mean and unit variance, and ranking the weights learned by the predictor (for N = 5) in decreasing order of absolute mag-nitude. Using this method, the most influential features (in decreasing order of importance) were: discussion-novelty , self-novelty , average number of comments to previous posts , standard deviation of discussion-novelty .
Our dataset consists of all papers published in SIGIR be-tween 1991 and 2002. We chose this dataset because it rep-resents the publications made by a single academic commu-nity, and that enough time has passed since the publication of the last paper in the collection to allow reasonable expo-sure time. This dataset consists of 499 papers published by 663 authors who have published more than one paper in that data period. We measured the number of citations made to a paper, as provided by Google Scholar at the end of 2009. The number of papers per author and the number of cita-tions per paper in our dataset have power-law distribution with power law factors k =  X  2 . 3( R 2 =0 . 96) for papers and k =  X  1 . 2( R 2 =0 . 63) for citations respectively.
The set of features we extracted for each paper is simi-lar to those of blogs and includes the average and standard deviation of the number of citations for previously pub-lished papers by the same author, the number of unique authors who cited papers by the same author, and the pa-per length. If there are several co-authors for a paper, we took the maximum, minimum, and average of the at-tributes for each author. Given a paper and time windows T s and T c we then calculated the paper X  X  self-novelty and contemporaneous-novelty fea tures. It is worth noting that for papers we did not measure the discussion-novelty since paper citations are not accompanied with text compared to blog post comments.
Similarly to the blog domain, we attempted to predict if the number of citations of a paper will be N or more. Be-cause of the relatively short time span of the data, we set T s =5yearsand T c =1year. Weuseda Decision Tree classifier, trained using all data; ten-fold cross validation was used to reduce the chance of over-fitting. Table 3 shows the ROC area (for predicting 10 or more citations) and the rank correlation of the decisio n tree classifier, when trained with 1) novelty-based features, 2) traditional features, and 3) all features. We observe a trend similar to that of the blog domain. Finally, we identified the three most influen-tial features for citation prediction by performing sequential forward feature selection: min(avg. contemporaneous nov-elty) , max(author activity) , min(std. self novelty) .
This work studies the relationship between novelty and popularity of user-generated content. Our results show that people are more likely to gain public attention by publishing novel content. Attractive posts are those that are novel with respect to previous content published by the same author, as well as novel with respect to contemporaneous published content, at least in some domains. In addition, stimulating posts that are able to trigger on-line discussion have high potential to become popular.
