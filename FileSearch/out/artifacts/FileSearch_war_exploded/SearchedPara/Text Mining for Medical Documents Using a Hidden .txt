 Patient records written by doctors are invaluable information especially in areas where experiences have great consequences. If doctors find useful information they ments of current patients. That is, it can provide a support for medical decision mak-ing or for quality assurance of medical treatment. 
In the treatment of chronic diseases, for example, the past records on the symp-result, they help their decisions for the direction of the next treatment. 
Moreover, hospitals where medical records are kept in the computers are increasing nowadays. The growing availability of medical documents in a machine-readable medical corpus can be extracted by an automated means.
 This paper describes a tagging system that yields high-level semantic tags for clinical documents in a medical information tracking system. The tags in this system are cate-gories of information that phrases of medical records contain, such as symptom, ther-doctors want to know about a certain therapeutic method, for example. The tagging system uses existing medical terminological resources, and probabilistic Hidden Markov Models [1] for semantic annotation. 
The contributions of this research can be summarized in three aspects. First, from a ences and knowledge embedded in the past patient records. Second, from a technical point of view, it attempts to annotate clinical text on phrases semantically rather than target for most tagging work. Finally, it uses a special method to guess unknown phrases that don X  X  appear in the training corpus for the robust tagging. The popular and conventional approach of part-of-speech (POS) tagging systems is to use a HMM model so as to find a most proper tag [2]. Some systems use a HMM with additional features. Julian Kupiec [3] and Dong Cutting et al. [4] described POS tag-ging systems, which have the concept of ambiguity class and equivalence class, re-spectively. Our system also adopted the equivalence class concept which group words into equivalence classes. 
Tagging systems in the medical field have focused on the lexical level of syntactic and semantic tagging. Patrick Ruch [5] and Stephen B. Johnson [6] performed seman-tic tagging on terms lexically using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). which categorized words syntactically. 
There also have been the systems which extract information from the medical nar-ratives [9, 10, 11]. Friedman [9, 10] defined six format types that characterize much of the information in the medical history sublanguage. The purpose of the tagging system is to annotate the clinical documents with semantic tags that can be used by a tracking system whose goal is to provide useful information to doctors. Our work is based on the list of questions doctors are interested in getting answers for, which was provided by Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH). Among them, we focused on the two questions:  X  X ow can X be used in the treatment of Y? X  and  X  X hat are the performance characteristics of X in the setting of Y? X  where X and Y can be substituted by {Medical Device, Biomedical or Dental Material, Food, Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure} and {Finding, Sign or Symptom, Disease or Syndrome}, respectively. Our tagging system assigns semantic tags to appropriate phrases so that the tracking system can answer those questions. The semantic tags were chosen to answer the questions from the doctors in SNUH. mately by a tracking system, we chose Symptom, Therapy, and Performance as the Target Semantic Tags (TST) for the current research. Symptom describes the state of a patient whereas Therapy means everything a medical expert performs for the patient, patient X  X  status (e.g. getting better or getting worse). 
TST in this research distinguish the tagging system unique because they represent higher level concepts. Unlike part-of-speech (POS) or UMLS semantic categories of a term, TST can be utilized by the application systems directly. In fact, TST was chosen for a particular application system in the first place. The categories of TST should be changed depending on the purpose of the application system, but the method we pro-pose can be used in the same manner with an appropriate training corpus. 
There can be different ways of assigning semantic tags to phrases. Our work is based on an observation that there is a specific sequence when people record some-CDA documents has implicit rules about sequences. 
In order to model the sequential aspect of the clinical documents, we opted for Hid-den Markov Model (HMM). Unfortunately, we cannot fully use the grammar rules in our research because our corpus includes Korean and English words mixed. But with the idea that people tend to write things in a certain sequence, we chose to use HMM. 
The system architecture for the semantic tagger using HMM is shown in Fig. 1. It is divided into two stages: training and tagging. 3.1 Common Part POS tagging. The former is for classifying medical terms in their semantics whereas the latter is for understanding the syntactic role of words. Abbreviations in the corpus are processed based on the research in the same project. 2) Detecting Phrase Boundary: This is important because symptom, therapy, or per-formance in TST is described with a phrase or a whole sentence, not a word. This task is grammatically correct sentences. In addition, periods are used not only for indication of the end of a sentence but also for abbreviations, dates, floating point numbers and so on. 
A phrase is defined to be a unit that ends with a predicate (i.e. a verb ending in Ko-verbs. Since doctors tend to write a subject like a lab test or medication in English and a predicate in English, a phrase tends to consist of both English and Korean words. 3) Labeling Phrase Units with Equivalence Class: Since there are many words occur-labels are used in HMM (see Table 1 for the equivalence classes). Words are grouped into equivalence classes, and a phrase is expressed with the set of equivalence classes with equivalence classes. 3.2 Training Part done manually. systems. One is to use the Baum-Welch algorithm [16] to train the probabilities, which does not require a tagged training corpus. Another advantage is that for differ-ent TST, the only thing we should do is just replace the corpus. The other method is to use tagged training data. This method counts frequencies of words/phrases/tags to estimate the probabilities required for a HMM model. The disadvantage of this method is that it needs a tagged training corpus whose quantity is enough to estimate work. Despite this disadvantage, we choose the second method because its accuracy is much higher than that of the Baum-Welch method. David Elworthy [13] and Bernard Merialdo [14] compared tagging performance using the Baum-Welch algorithm much more effective. 3.3 Tagging Part 1) Tagging: The system finds a most probable tag sequence using the Viterbi algo-rithm [15] using the HMM model constructed in the training stage. 2) Tagging of unknown phrase units: phrases appearing in the test corpus are catego-rized into largely two groups. The first group is for a phrase with no component word known to the system and hence transformed to an equivalence class label. There is no clue in the phrase that can be used in predicting its meaning. Since the whole phrase is corpus that contains many unknown phrases. The other group is for the unknown combination of the class labels corresponding to the phrase is not simply available in although the unit itself is unknown (see Fig. 2 for an example). 
When an unknown pattern appears as an observance, it is compared against the ex-isting patterns so that the best pattern can be found, to which the unknown pattern can be transformed. That is, an unknown pattern is regarded as the best matching pattern. is the same as that of the selected pattern. The probability of that unknown pattern of observance is calculated using the probability of the most similar pattern. When more average of the most similar patterns. 4.1 Data The Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) provides a model for clinical documents standard for the representation and machine processing of clinical documents in a way that makes the documents both human readable and machine processable and guaran-tees preservation of the content by using the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) standard. It is a useful and intuitive approach to management of documents which make up a large part of the clinical information processing area [12]. 
We picked 300 sections of  X  X rogress after hospital stay X  from the CDA documents as the target corpus provided by SNUH for research purposes. 
The training corpus consists of 200  X  X rogress after hospital stay X  sections contain-with 601 phrases. 4.2 Performance The level of accuracy of our system is calculated as the number of correct tags per the total number of tags. Fig.3 shows the comparison of the basic model with and without pected, it is promising and undergoing further improvement. We suggest the direction of modification below.
