 How can you discover something new, that matches your in-terest? Recommender Systems have been studied since the 90ies. Their benefit comes from guiding a user through the density of the information jungle to useful knowledge clear-ings. Early research on recommender systems focuses on al-gorithms and their evaluation to improve recommendation accuracy using F-measures and other methodologies from signal-detection theory. Present research includes other as-pects such as human factors that affect the user experience and interactive visualization techniques to support trans-parency of results and user control. In this paper, we ana-lyze all publications on recommender systems from the sco-pus database, and particularly also papers with such an HCI focus. Based on an analysis of these papers, future topics for recommender systems research are identified, which include more advanced support for user control, adaptive interfaces, affective computing and applications in high risk domains. Recommender Systems, Human-Computer Interaction, Un-certainty, Risk
You have most certainly seen the output of a recommender system. The online retailer Amazon suggests your next pur-chase by letting you know what others bought together with the product you X  X e currently viewing ( X  X requently bought together. X ). And maybe you have also experienced the limi-tations of such systems by getting suggestions that made no sense to you at all.

Several recommendation techniques, such as content-based, knowledge-based, collaborative filtering and their hybridiza-tions, are discussed in state-of-the-art surveys [1, 5], in-cluding their merits and limitations. Typical fields of ap-plication are recommending movies, music or related prod-ucts in e-commerce. These application domains are similar: each recommendation is important in creating additional revenue and of relatively low risk. Recommender systems are not typically used to propose medical procedure, emer-gency plans in nuclear plants or stock trading, where uncer-tainty and risk are high. Why is this the case?
This paper reflects on the development of recommender systems by reviewing publications from scopus. We look back at the past to reflect on present research and try to pre-dict future research topics for recommender systems based on current trends in ICT and a short bibliometric analysis of the field of recommender systems.
Tapestry [8] was the first system that employed collabora-tive filtering to filter the large amount of emails that reached people in Xerox PARC. It included a system based on an-notating emails and later filtering emails according to these annotations. The novelty was the collaborative aspect of this annotation process.

The term recommender system appears for the first time in a 1997 article by Paul Vesnick and Hal R. Varian [25] and describes recommender systems as a tool for decision making and not just for information retrieval. They already argue in terms of evaluating costs (of false positives/negatives) be-yond mere measures from signal detection theory.

Since then research on recommender systems has dras-tically increased. Over 9,400 articles and 76 reviews can be found on scopus 1 . The trend shows an ever increasing amount published on recommender systems (see Fig. 1). Ad-ditionally, we see two peaks in review papers about recom-mender systems (see Fig. 1). The first peak in 2005 and the second in 2010.

The first review paper on recommender systems by Her-locker et al. [11] focused on evaluation of recommender sys-tems. Another review by Adomavicius and Thuzhilin [1] dis-cusses the use of content-based, collaborative and hybrid ap-proaches and proposes possible extension for research. The authors also mention the evaluation related problems with measures of signal detection theory such as the famous F1-Measure. Such metrics focus on coverage and accuracy [1], while at the same time criteria like usefulness and quality as well as, explainability, trustworthiness, scalability and pri-vacy issues may play bigger roles in applications. http://www.scopus.com (as of April 10 th 2016) Figure 1: The amount of articles published on rec-ommender systems has been constantly increasing, while reviews have had two spikes.
In recent years, researchers have become more aware of the fact that effectiveness of recommender systems goes beyond recommendation accuracy [16]. Thus, research on these hu-man factors has gained increased interest, for instance by combining interactive visualization techniques with recom-mendation techniques to support transparency and control-lability of the recommendation process. Visualization lever-ages visual representations to facilitate human perception, while interaction stresses user involvement through dialogue with the system. In a recent study, 24 interactive recom-mender systems were analysed that use an interactive visu-alization technique to support user interaction [10]. A large share of these systems focus on transparency of the recom-mendation process to address the black box issue. Here, the overall objective is to explain the inner logic of a recom-mender system to the user in order to increase acceptance of recommendations. A good example of this approach is Peer-Chooser [19], a visual interactive recommender that uses a graph-based representation to show relationships between users and recommended items from a collaborative filter-ing recommender system. Similarly, SmallWorlds [9] allows the exploration of relationships between recommended items and friends with a similar profile using multiple aspects. This way, users can explore different relationships to gain transparency and ultimately increase the chance of finding items.

In addition, TasteWeights [3] allows users to control the impact of the profiles and behaviors of friends and peers on the recommendation results. TasteWeights provides an in-terface for such hybrid recommendations. The system elicits preference data and relevance feedback from users at run-time in order to adapt recommendations. SetFusion [22] is a recent example that allows users to fine-tune weights of a hy-brid recommender system. SetFusion uses a Venn diagram to visualize relationships between recommendations.
Results of this survey indicate that many interesting pro-totypes have been developed and evaluated that demon-strate the importance of this research for the community. Nevertheless, many open research challenges exist that pro-vide interesting opportunities for research in this field.
Trying to predict the future is only helpful when the pre-diction increases the knowledge about the future beyond what is already known. Safe bets are uninteresting predic-tions, while wild guesses may seem ridiculous from hind-sight. Therefore using safe bets from other fields that may relate to recommender research may prove to be an inter-esting middle-ground.
From the Scopus database we searched for all documents from the field of computer science that contained the search term  X  X ecommender system X  (n=9,432). From this data-set we extracted the author keywords. We removed all stop words, punctuation and mapped common noun phrases to single-word phrases (e.g. user model to user model). We then counted frequencies for all years and plotted the rela-tive frequency of selected terms to analyze possible trends regarding our selection (see Fig. 2). The terms were chosen to contrast HCI related keywords (in the left column) with more algorithm related keywords (in the right column).
When taking a closer look at publication counts (see Fig. 1) we can see two spikes in review publishing curve. The most cited works in the first spike are the previously mentioned reviews [1, 11]. The same year (2005) also marks a change in interest in topics (see Fig. 2), focusing on adaptive rec-ommender systems and the user model. The second change in topics can be seen in 2009, where trust becomes a heavily published keyword. The second spike in reviews three years later marks another change in interest, where the most fre-quently cited reviews [7, 15] focus on machine learning and user focus.

Surely developments in improving algorithms are impor-tant and some interesting directions were proposed by Park et al. [21]. On the other hand, some researchers in recent reviews [15, 10] have argued for focusing on the user of the recommendation system. Following the latter argument, we think that HCI related aspects are underrepresented in lit-erature (see Fig. 2) and yet critically important for future applications of recommender systems.

Current research on interactive recommender systems is focused on controlling the importance of different recom-mendation parameters or revising the user profile [10]. Such control is insufficient to establish a good level of trust and to address privacy concerns [2]. Further research is needed to support more advanced levels of interaction, such as controls that define which data can be tracked and taken into ac-count for which purposes. Examples of such more advanced levels of control have been researched extensively by the vi-sual analytics (VA) community. Whereas these examples are promising, research is needed to apply these VA concepts, methods and techniques to the field of recommender systems and casual users.

The aim of adequate user control is to increase recom-mendation accuracy [24] by incorporating user input and feedback. Previous research shows however that user satis-faction does not always correlate with high recommendation from occurrence in author keywords from 9,432 publications. accuracy and that other factors, such as the knowledge level of the user [14] and her interests [12], need to be consid-ered. Current recommender systems interfaces are static , i.e. they do not tailor the interface to these user charac-teristics. There is a need to adapt recommender systems and their user interfaces to these different personal and sit-uational characteristics. Research that has been conducted by the adaptive hypermedia, adaptive visualization and per-sonalized search communities provides a promising starting point to address this challenge.

Emotions play a crucial role in decision making [23]. An interesting future line of research is to experiment with novel sensing technologies to capture behavioral data (physiolog-ical data, facial expressions, speech, ...) in order to detect emotions and to adapt recommendations based on emotional responses. Although measurement of emotions in a con-trolled laboratory environment is well studied for years by a large number of research groups [20], multimodal emotion recognition in real world environments is still a challeng-ing task [17]. A good review of existing methods has been reported by Hrabal [13]. As none of the methods have yet led to successful subject-and situation-independent emotion recognition, interactive methods that enable users to revise detected variables seem promising. The challenge is to re-search the development of a next generation of recommender systems that can incorporate both automatically acquired data and revisions by end-users as a basis to tailor recom-mendations based on current contextual needs of the user, including emotions that are key in decision making.
The biggest risk a user of e-commerce faces is spending money for an undesired product. Thus product recommen-dations are of very specific risk. Other domains have a higher level of uncertainty and risk. Giving recommendations in do-mains were choices must be made under uncertainty and risk is intricately more challenging. Risk-aware algorithms [4] or predictions of risks [6] have been investigated only recently and not extensively. How uncertainty and risk of a recom-mendation should be visualized or communicated has not been investigated yet, but may be crucial for the applica-tion of these in high-risk domains such as medicine [18].
Looking at the big trends in ICT we see that Big Data and thus more advanced techniques from AI (e.g. deep learning) will become available and then applied to recommender sys-tems. These do not only play a role in improving algorithms but also new interactions paradigms. In the future we could analyze not just the transactions of users, but also patterns of interaction (e.g. mouse movement, keystrokes, facial ex-pressions etc.). These ultimately lead to new research ques-tions for new adaptive interfaces and how the user controls these recommender systems. When recommending in do-mains of risk or uncertainty new visualizations will be nec-essary to improve the trust and understanding of recommen-dations. Using more intimate data such as facial expression will also bring new problems of privacy and user acceptance.
The bibliometric analysis was conducted using a pre-defined set of keywords. We have put efforts into mapping similar terms to our terms, nevertheless some keywords might have been overlooked. Looking at the relative frequencies skews the data in favor of this set of keywords. Thus our findings represent upper thresholds for relative importance.
