This classification is based on whether there is experimental evidence for the expression o f molecular gene produ cts for specified genes within a given p aper. The system performs pre -processing and d ata cleaning, followed b y feature e xtraction from the raw text. It sub sequ ently class ifies the paper using the e xtracted features with a Na X ve Bayes Classifier. Our app roach h as made it po ssible to classify (and curate) biomedical papers automatically, thu s po tentially saving con siderable time a nd resou rces. Keywords : Text mining, Pre -pro cessing, Na X ve Bayes Classifier , ROC curve, Paper curation Background and introdu ction o f this KDD Cup 2002 competiti on task1 were described in an o verview article by A. Yeh et. al. (this issue). In bu ilding the system, we too k three steps  X  data pre -processing, data preparation for the c lassifier, and mod el bu ilding. The original articles were formatted as raw text files. The text in these files con tained large a moun ts of no ise. As s uch, extensive pre -proce ssing and d ata c leaning is needed to b e ca rried ou t so that t he a rticles cou ld b e represented in a mann er by which features cou ld b e prop erly extracted and relevant statistics abou t these features generated. The first step in p re -processing t he data was the removal of certain con trol characters in the raw text that wou ld o therwise interfere with the detection o f gene symbo ls within the text. This ou tpu t from no ise removal was then p assed into the modu le that performed the synon ym replace ment. Using different synon yms to reference a particular gene is very comm on in b iomedical papers. To find ou t the occurrence of a gene, it i s nece ssary to replace a ll t he synon yms with the original gene symbo l. Document formatti ng was includ ed as part of the pre -processing. The pre -processed article files were used as inpu t to generate a correspond ing file that was formatted in a c on sistent mann er . These files had special tags to ind icate the location o f different section s and p a ragraph s in the text. Extraction o f f eatures from the a rticles involved searching for gene symbo ls and variou s evidence keywords from the text. According to the task do cumentation , there were tens of evidence type s. We managed to u se 12 types in bu ilding the mod el. We generated two types of keywords in which on e type was from evidence files themselves (e.g. the ph rase "no rthern b lot" was picked as on e keyword for an evidence of a transcript ) and the other type was manu ally extracted from the training texts by do main experts . When the two sets of keywords were ready, the statistics generation was carried ou t. We were interested in the distance between a gene symbo l and the keyword. For instance, if the gene a nd the keyword were in the same sentence, the distance was 0. If keyword is in the next sentence, the distance was 1. Within a single paragraph , the distances were ca lculated and recorded in an ou tpu t file that was generated for eac h evidence type. To find the needed yes/no (Y/N) answe rs, we decided to split ou r system into 2 levels. One level determined whether experimental evidence e xisted for a produ ct (transcript (TR) or po lypeptide (PP )) of a particular gene within a particular paper or do cument (do c -gene -level). The other level d etermined whether such evidence e xisted for any gene in a particular paper (do c -level). A 'Y' for any gene produ ct at the do c -gene -level wou ld lead to a 'Y' at that paper's do c -level, which meant that the paper shou ld b e curated. After the final stage of text processing, a list of do c -gene examples is produ ced. For eac h do c -gene c ombination , if gene occurs s everal ti mes within on e paragraph , there a re several repetiti ve representation s fo r this do c -gene e xample. However, on ly on e e xample is nece ssary. As s uch, we removed the redund ant examples. In essence, the do c -gene e xample that had the minimum distance between a particular gene und er con sideration and the other SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 94 keywords was cho sen as the representative e xample. All ti es were kept. This was don e to bo th the po sitive a nd n egative e xamples. This s tep is on ly app lied to the training set. Upon removing the repetiti ve do c -gene e xamples found within the same paragraph , the po s itive e xamples to b e given to the c lassifier were manu ally cho sen. Once the po sitive e xamples are manu ally selected, they are c ombined with the other negative e xamples. Beca use the answers are a n abb reviated form of the e vidence files, these files were no t available for the test set. The data generated from the text are tr ansformed to the final format. For the n th keyword, the minimal absolute distance (KW n ) is kept and the c oun t (KW n _coun t) of its app earance around the gene und er con sideration is listed as a feature. Hence, for eac h keyword two features are c reated. The section in which the particular example occurs is also u sed as a feature. After this pre -processing, the data is ready for classifier bu ilding. Th e Na X ve Bayes Classifier ( NBC ) has been u sed as an effective classifier for many y ears [1]. The use of NBC facilit ated a qu ick runn ing time. This was essential for ou r system, which requ ired bu ilding classifiers, eac h with a large nu mber of inpu t records. The ROC c urve [2] and the F -measure were used as s coring mechanisms. There a re two -stages for mod el bu ilding (eac h h aving a c lassifier) . In the first stage, the do c -gene e xamples (statistics of KW n , KW n _coun t) are given as inpu t to the first classifier. An ini tial prob abilistic e stimates of whether a 'YES' class ( for Ev i ) is ob tained for a given do c -gene e xample which was don e by 5 -fold cross validation . As s uch, there was a pr ob abilit y estimate for all do c -gene e xamples. The do c -gene e xamples are no t un iqu e beca use some ties were kept. There c ou ld b e more than on e example for a particular do c -gene. Since the final scores are compu ted for distinct do c -gene e xamples, it was nece s sary to finally compu te a F -measure based on distinct do c -gene e xamples. This was carried ou t by picking the e xample with the highest prob abilit y for similar do c -genes s o that on ly on e of them was used as the representative e xample. At the e nd o f the firs t stage, a set of distinct do c -gene e xamples was available for inpu t into a second classifier.
 In the second s tage , distinct do c -gene patterns are used to train the classifier. The prob abilistic ou tpu t is used to compu te the ROC curve a nd F -measure a t the do c -gene level. In p lotting the ROC, the nu mber of true po sitives was taken to b e the ac tual nu mber of po sitively classified do cuments in the e ntire set of training do cuments. In this way the mod el was bu ilt for eac h evidence type.
 Figure 1 sho ws the mod e l. For eac h gene listed with eac h p aper, steps were ca rried ou t to answer the do c -gene -level Y/N qu estion s by determining whether experimental evidence e xisted for that gene's TR produ cts and similarly for PP prod ucts. For example, let the scores for the three genes in p aper R100 b e a s follows: gene R100 -no rpA is 0.86 , R100 -Plc21 C is 0.06 and R100 -w is 0.05 . Then 0 .86 will be cho sen as paper R100 's representative score.
 A thresho ld was s et by maximizing [ROC + F -me asure].The score of a paper was no t on ly critical for curation o f a single paper. It also d etermined the po sition o f the paper in the ranked list. The higher the score is, the higher the paper is ranked.
 C i is the i th part of t he fi r st classifier ; Ev i is the i th Evidence type In this issue's task 1 o verview article (A. Yeh et. al.) are the results from this task's s ub mission s. Each o f ou r scores were within the c orrespond ing first qu artile. Our app roach p e rformed qu ite well on the "ranked -list" (81 %) and "yes/no curate paper" (73 %) sub tasks. In this work, an app roach h as been p rovided for detecting evidence of gene -produ ct formation in b iomedical papers. In particular, a do cument collection on Dr osoph ila was s tud ied. The biomedical articles were initially pre -processed to remove no ise and to p rovide for stand ardization b etween articles. Impo rtant features were then extracted and u sed as inpu t into a Na X ve Bayes Classifier. We found that do main kn owledge was essential for the feature e xtraction task. A classifier was bu ilt for eac h evidence type, the results from which were finally combined for evidence detection o f gene -produ ct formation .
