 Unlike in general recommendation scenarios where a user has only a single role, users in trust rating network, e.g. Epin-ions, are associated with two different roles simultaneously: as a truster and as a trustee. With different roles, users can show distinct preferences for rating items, which the previ-ous approaches do not involve. Moreover, based on explicit single links between two users, existing methods can not capture the implicit correlation between two users who are similar but not socially connected. In this paper, we propose to learn dual role preferences (tr uster/trustee-specific prefer-ences) for trust-aware recommendation by modeling explicit interactions (e.g., rating and trust) and implicit interactions. In particular, local links structure of trust network are ex-ploited as two regularization terms to capture the implicit user correlation, in terms of truster/trustee-specific prefer-ences. Using a real-world and open dataset, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study to investigate the per-formance of the proposed model, RoRec. The results show that RoRec outperforms other trust-aware recommendation approaches, in terms of prediction accuracy.
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Information filtering Collaborative Filtering; Matrix Factorization; Network Struc-ture; Dual Role
As a subclass of information filtering systems, recommender systems seek to predict the rating or preference that user would give to an item they have not yet considered. Con-ventional recommender systems generally focus on exploit-ing ratings information for modeling user preferences [1, 7]. With the increasing popularity of social media, users are allowed to actively engage in various online social activi-ties, which provides an additional information about users beyond ratings, among which trust relations are the most widelystudied[2,3,4,5,9].

Each user in trust rating network, e.g. Epinions, plays t-wo different roles:  X  X rusters X  who trust others and  X  X rustees X  who are trusted by others. As a truster, one will be more likely affected by the existing ratings or reviews provided by other users he/she trusts, and in the same way, as a trustee, his/her contributions (ratings or reviews) will consequently affect others who trust him/her. The preferences of the two roles of users can be distinct from each other [9]. E.g., for a digital product specialist who just wants to learn cook-ing, he/she is more likely to trust lots of chefs while being trusted by many digital products consumers. Hence, when predicting user preferences for an item, it is more reasonable to take into account both truster-and trustee-specific pref-erences simultaneously. By contrast, the previous methods model the users by using only a single role [2, 3, 4, 5], or considering the two roles independently [9]. That is, no dis-tinction is made between the dual roles of users in the rating generation process.

By explicitly interacting with others, such as establishing trust relations, users show his/her preferences as a truster or trustee. Sometimes, however, users do not explicitly but implicitly interact with the other users. For example, sup-posed users a and b are very interested in cooking and trust lots of chefs while they are not socially connected, we say a and b interact with each other implicitly and reveal implicit correlation, in terms of truster-specific preferences. Existing methods are effective in capturing explicit relations, while are not suitable for discovering and modeling the above im-plicit interactions.

To overcome these two limitations, in this paper, we pro-pose a novel framework, named RoRec, for modeling users X  dual role preferences for trust-aware recommendation. Vary-ing preferences of the two roles of users are learnt by model-ing explicit interactions (e.g., rating and trust) and implic-it interactions. Specifically, (1) truster-and trustee-specific preferences are estimated to fit the explicit ratings and trust relations using matrix factorization techniques. (2) Distinct from existing methods which measure two user correlations solely based on single links between two users, in RoRec, lo-cal links structure of trust network are leveraged to evaluate the correlations between two trusters/trustees for modeling implicit interactions.
We shortly review some related work. By fusing trust re-lations into matrix factorization techniques, several model-based methods for modeling user preferences are proposed, such as SoRec [4], STE [3], SocialMF [2] and SoReg [5]. How-ever, these methods map users into a single feature space, neglecting the different roles assigned to users.

The most related work is TrustMF [9], which maps user-s into two truster and trustee space, and models the effect from trusted users on rating items. However, in TrustMF, dual role preferences are learnt independently to estimate ratings, while we argue that it is more reasonable to take both truster-and trustee-specific preferences into account simultaneously in learning process since the rating is gener-ated from both roles. Also, TrustMF can not capture the implicit correlation between two trusters/trustees when they are not socially connected. We use TrustMF as our major comparative to evaluate the performance of recommendation in the experimental section.
We first introduce notations used in this paper. Let U = { u 1 ,u 2 , ..., u n } and V = { v 1 ,v 2 , ..., v m } be the set of users and items respectively, where n is the number of users and m is the number of items. We consider a rating matrix R  X  R n  X  m describing n users X  numerical ratings on m items. R i,j = 0 represents the missing rating score from u i to v In addition, S  X  R n  X  n is user trust relations matrix, where S i,j is a real number within the interval [0 , 1] describing the strength of trust relation between u i and u j .

Let W i  X  R K and E i  X  R K be the K -dimension truster-specific preference vector and trustee-specific preference vec-tor for user u i , respectively. That is, W i describes user u preferences for items as a truster, and E i represents his/her preferences as a trustee. Similarly, let V j  X  R K be the K -dimension characteristic vector for item v j . Then we in-vestigate how to learn users X  dual role preferences for more accurate rating estimation.
In this subsection, we model how the ratings and trust relations are generated from the perspective of dual roles.
Due to the assumption that the different roles affect rat-ing generation in the different way [9], every observed rating should be determined by the user X  X  truster-specific prefer-ences, as well as trustee-specific preferences. Based on this, we estimate the rating from user u i to item v j as follows: where b U i and b V j denote the biases of user u i and item v in the context of rating, respectively. For example, critical users tend to rate low rating while lenient users may often give high ratings, and popular items are more likely to be rated high. g ( x ) is logistic function, i.e., g ( x )= 1 is an ensemble parameter which controls the contribution to the rating from the dual roles. We can learn all the param-eters by solving the following objective function where I R i,j is an indicator function that is equal to 1 if user u rated item v j and is 0 otherwise.
Intuitively, the predicted strength of trust relation be-tween user u i and u k is given by: where b W i and b E k denote the biases of truster i and trustee k , respectively, in the context of trusting.

Similar to Equation 2, preference vectors can be learnt by solving the following term where I S i,k is an indicator function that is equal to 1 if user u trusted user u k (i.e., S i,k &gt; 0) and is 0 otherwise.
In this subsection, we model implicit interactions between two trusters/trustees by incorporating links structure of trust network as two regularization terms to constrain the objec-tive function.
Two trusters are similar if they share many out-links in trust network, that is, they co-trust many common trustees. By taking into all trusted trustees instead of relying on one single link, we can obtain more robust and accurate correla-tion between two users even they are not explicitly connect-ed. Considering only single link for inferring user tastes ex-actly is the basic idea of existing approaches, such as SoReg [5] and TrustMF [9], with an inherent limitation of disre-garding the implicit correlated users. Therefore, in order to capture the similarity between two trusters based on the structure of out-links, we adopt the following metric In our experiments, S i,k we use is hard value, 0 or 1. Super-scribe W indicates it is the similarity between two trusters.
With the similarity between two trusters, truster regular-ization is to minimize the following term A large value of C W i,j indicates that truster i and j share many out-links, and thus we force their preference vectors should be as close as possible. A small value of C W i,j tells that the distance between two preference vectors should be large. By introducing the structure-based similarity, truster-specific preference vectors are constrained in learning pro-cess.

Taking another insight into Equation 6, we find that the truster-specific preference vector for u i is smoothed with other trusters, controlled by the strength of truster simi-larity. Hence, for cold start users who rated few items, we still can obtain an approximate estimate of their preference vectors by minimizing Equation 6.
Two trustees are similar if they share many in-links in trust network, that is, they are co-trusted by many com-mon trusters. The similarity between two trustees can be captured by exploiting the structure of in-links as follows:
Similar to truster regularization, we propose a trustee reg-ularization term to model the assumption as follows
So far, we have demonstrated how to model explicit inter-actions and implicit interactions between trusters/trustees, respectively. We then propose the following integrated mod-el considering the related information that may benefit rec-ommendations.
 where  X  W and  X  E are parameters to control the extent of truster/trustee regularization, respectively. To reduce the model complexity, we set  X  W =  X  E . The last term is reg-ularization term to avoid overfitting, and  X  is the regular-ization parameter. Thus, we can obtain a local minimum of the objective function in Equation 9 by performing batch gradient descent on preferences vectors and bias terms.
Dataset . The dataset we used for evaluation is Epinions 1 dataset. The dataset contains 577,985 rating records from 15,126 users for 58,946 items (sparsity: 99.93%). And the total number of trust relations is 415,960. To evaluate the proposed method, we randomly select 80% of rating records as training set, and the remaining 20% records as test set.
Evaluation . We adopt two popular metrics to measure the performance of recommendation approaches, i.e., Mean http://www.epinions.com Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), since we focus on estimating rating.
 MAE is defined as: where R i,j denotes the estimated rating generated by a cer-tain approach, and R i,j is ground truth. N is the number of test cases in test set. RMSE is defined as: As the definitions show, a smaller value of RMSE or MAE indicates a better performance.

Comparison methods . As shown in Table 1, for all comparison methods, we set respective optimal parameters either according to corresponding references or based on our experiments. Note that, RoRec0 is obtained by omitting implicit interactions (i.e., setting  X  W ,  X  E to 0), and RoRec1 is obtained by considering only explicitly connected users (i.e., S ij &gt; 0) in regularization terms in Equation 9 . Table 1: Comparison methods and parameter set-tings.

Experimental results are reported in Table 2, where K is the dimensionality of feature spaces. The key observations in this experimental study are summarized as follows: (1) We can observe that the proposed method RoRec consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, in terms of MAE and RMSE. In particular, compared to the best method in comparisons, TrustMF, RoRec obtains 2 . 9% relative improvement under RMSE ( K =10). This demon-strates that accurate dual role preferences modeling can im-prove the recommendation performance. (2) RoRec, RoRec1, RoRec0 and TrustMF perform bet-ter than other methods, which map users into single feature space. This coincides with our assumption that differentiat-ing truster and trustee for modeling explicit interactions can benefit accurate recommendation. Further, it is observed that RoRec and RoRec1 achieve smaller values of MAE and RMSE over TrustMF and RoRec0. This confirms the effec-tiveness of considering explicit/implicit correlations between users. Finally, the improvements from RoRec over RoRec1 demonstrate the advantage of additionally incorporating lo-cal structure of trust relations for constraining feature spaces over merely single links.
We firstly group users into six classes according to their number of ratings in training set. Figure 1(a) illustrates the distribution of the number of testing data over the six groups. MAE generally shares the similar trend with RMSE over different groups, hence we only illustrate the results of RMSE with different dimensions in Figure 1(b) and 1(c), respectively, due to the space limitation.

It is obvious that the proposed method RoRec generally outperforms SoReg and TrustMF in each user group. In par-ticular, when dimensionality is 10, RoRec improves SoReg by 2 . 8  X  4 . 0%, and improves TrustMF by 1 . 7  X  5 . 0% re-spectively. We also notice that RoRec yields much smaller RMSE than SoReg and TrustMF when more ratings are ob-served.

One more key observation is that RoRec obtains obvi-ous gains of 0 . 035 and 0 . 020, unde r RMSE, over SoReg and TrustMF for users in first group ( K =10), respectively. This demonstrates the ability of RoRec to handle cold start users. For cold start users, though very few ratings are observed, by incorporating trust relations and the link structure for learning an approximate estimate of their preferences, our model can generate accurate recommendations.
In this paper, we investigate how to model dual role prefer-ences for improving the accuracy of trust-aware recommen-dation. Specifically, truster/trustee-specific preferences are learnt to fit the rating matrix and trust matrix, i.e., explicit interactions. Further, local links structure of trust network is exploited as two regularization terms to model implicit interactions, thus shaping truster/trustee preference spaces. Based on the intuition that reviews from users with high reputation are more likely to be trusted, we could consider the global structure of trust network to provide RoRec with more potential power in the future work.
