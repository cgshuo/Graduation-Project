 He Hu 1 , Yiyu Zhao 1 , Yan Wang 1 , Man Li 1 , Dazhi Wang 2 , Wenjuan Wu 1 , Internet and WWW have become important sources for information acquisi-tion. More and more individuals and enterprisers set up homepages on the Web, publishing various related information. In theory, we can get almost all kinds of information we need by Web searching; but in practice, the problems of the unstructured Web pages, the chaos of Web links, the explosion of Web sizes and the diversity and dynamics of Web contents all make it not an easy job to find the accurate information.
 operators. Search engines can only retrieve data on a purely syntactic basis. It is not possible to embed domain specific knowledge into the search engines X  queries. Ontology approach can solve this problem by providing a semantic foun-dation in these systems. Tom Gruber [2] has defined ontology as  X  X  specification of a conceptualization X . Ontologies provide a deeper level of meaning by pro-viding equivalence relations between concepts; they can standardize meaning, description, representation of involved concepts, terms and attributes; capture the semantics involved via domain characteristics, resulting in semantic meta-data and  X  X ntological commitment X  which forms basis for knowledge sharing and reuse. Ontologies can provide a domain theory using an expressive language for capturing the domain. One of the properties of ontologies is that all relevant knowledge has been made explicit; this constitutes in the necessity of specifying many relationships that are otherwise left implicit and are only made explicit in the applications developed for working with the ontology.
 which aims to add semantics and better structure to the information available on the Web. Underlying this is the goal of making the Web more effective not only for humans but also for automatic software agents. The basic idea is to create an environment for intelligent programs to carry out tasks independently on behalf of the user. Ontologies in fact turn out to be the backbone technol-ogy for the Semantic Web, Tim Berners-Lee [3] has portrayed Semantic Web as a layered architecture where ontology layer lies in the middle of the other layers. Our cooperative ontology developing environment is based on role-based collabo-rative development method (RCDM)[1]. The tool has been applied in construct-ing law and economics ontology in the project for subject-oriented semantic web in Renmin University of China. As the base of building the subject-oriented semantic web about law and economics, large-scale ontologies on law and on economics are needed. The development environment based on RCDM is the first step towards the final goal, and it has been proven to be proper and effec-tive. The project is a medium but comprehensive system, and we will continue to test and improve our system in practice.
 3.1 Economic Ontology Economic ontology is constructed from the resources in digital library of hu-manities and social science in Renmin University of China (RUC). RUC is one of the most important researching centers in humanities and social science. The economic ontology includes the basic concepts and relations used in economic field. The ontology covers information about experts and scholars, science insti-tutions, science conferences, science and research projects, statistic information, case information, information sources and glossary entry etc. 3.2 A Combination with Digital Library During the process of building the Economic Semantic Web, we work closely with the Digital Library team of RUC. The quick development of Web information retrieval has posed new challenges and opportunities to traditional library re-searchers. The Digital Library team of RUC is creating tools and services needed by the RUC Libraries to create, manage and employ digital resources, as well as those needed by the RUC University community and the world beyond to access and use the libraries X  digital collections. As cited above, the Economic ontology is constructed from the resources of the Digital Library in RUC. The demo Semantic Web we are currently building is planned to be deployed to the Portal of the Digital Library, making it a good Semantic Web demonstration. 3.3 Economic Semantic Web The Economic Semantic Web is a subject-oriented Semantic Web, with its focus on economic field. The Economic Semantic Web uses multi-layered represen-tation framework. XML is used to describe the structure of documents in an unifying way. RDF brings the ability of describing the semantics of document structures. With the development of Semantic Web research, we are more and more concerned with the problem of representing and retrieving information con-tent on the Web. The ontology language layer building on top of RDF schema is used to formally describe the meaning of terms in the Web documents vocabu-laries, which plays a key role in building Semantic Web. Web ontology language (OWL [5]) is the standard Web ontology language proposed by W3C, it is used in Economic Semantic Web to define economic ontology. OWL has three sub-languages: OWL Full, OWL DL and OWL Lite.
 document can include an optional ontology header and any number of class, prop-erty, and individual descriptions or axioms. A named class in an OWL ontology can be described by a class identifier. An anonymous class can be described by exhaustively enumerating all the individuals that form the instances of this class (owl:oneOf), by a property restriction (owl:Restriction), or by logical operation on two or more classes (owl:intersectionOf, owl:unionOf, owl:complementOf). Property restrictions include value (owl:allValuesFrom) and cardinality restric-tions (owl:cardinality, owl:maxCardinality, owl:minCardinality). The semantics of OWL is defined based on model theory, in the way analogous to the seman-tics of Description Logic[6]. OWL DL sub-language can be mapped to SHIQ description logic.
 Description Logic is a subset of Predicate Logic. It allows specifying a termino-logical hierarchy using a restricted set of first order logic formulas; therefore it is well suited for modelling. Latest research proposes that it is possible and even more efficient to transfer Description Logic into Horn Logic Programs. Descrip-tion Logic provides a reasonably sophisticated facility for defining categories in terms of existing relations. 3.4 IIR on the Economic Semantic Web Intelligent Information Retrieval is supported on the Economic Semantic Web. Keyword (Syntactic)-based retrieval has been popularized by current Web search services. However, due to the problems associated with polysemy and synonym [4], web users are often unable to get the accurate information they are looking for. Concept retrieval is one of solutions to this problem. Using the concepts and relations defined in economic ontology, the Economic Semantic Web supports concept retrieval on economic field, gains a better recall and precision perfor-mance than the traditional search services. We give a brief demonstration of our Cooperative Ontology Development Envi-ronment CODE in the paper, and discuss the design and functionalities of the Economic Semantic Web being built at RUC.
