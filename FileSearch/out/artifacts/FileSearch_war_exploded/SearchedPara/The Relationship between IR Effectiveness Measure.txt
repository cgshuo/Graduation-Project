 This paper presents an experime ntal study of users assessing the quality of Google web search results . In particular we look at how users X  satisfaction correlates with the effectiveness of Google as quantified by IR measures such as precision and the suite of Cumulative Gain measures (CG, DCG, NDCG). Results indicate strong correlation between users X  satisfaction, CG and precision, moderate correlation with DCG, with perhaps surprisingly negligible correlation with NDCG. The reasons for the low correlation with NDCG are examined. B.8 [Performance and Reliability] : General Measurement, Performance User satisfaction, IR Effectiveness measures Search engines are among the most popular and useful services on the web. Since the effectiveness of a retrieval system should be evaluated on the basis of how much it helps users achieve their task effectively and efficiently [2], the rating of search engine results by the user should be taken into account to evaluate search engines as a whole. To our knowledge there is no previous work that directly addresses the relationship between precision , Cumulative Gain (CG) , Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) , Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG ) and users X  satisfaction. Therefore, this paper presents the relationship between these measures. The study asked 26 users to search on four queries from a pool of 104 queries of which compiled by th e author; these queries are of four categories (26 queries of fam ous artists, 26 queries of some diseases, 26 queries of famous politicians, and 26 queries of religions X  principles). Each user was given one query from each category. The tasks were de signed to emulate a simple information finding task (i.e., fi nd pages that contain relevant information to Mozart). Users searched directly in Google 1 , which was chosen for its popularity and high effectiveness as identified by [1]. Time allotted for each ta sk was twelve minutes and users were asked to judge the first ten pages resulting from the best query they issued. They rated the effectiveness of each page at NDCG was initially tested and proven to work well in test collection evaluations with the existence of a wide range of relevance judgments [3] [4]. Howe ver, the work discussed here has a very limited set of judgments , first 10 pages, which effected NDCG during the normalizing step, especially in cases where the ranking was identical to the ideal which led NDCG=1.0 (this situation was unlikely to occur in the past work [3] [4]). Hence NDCG does not correlate strongly with other measures (such as precision, users X  satisfaction with coverage, accuracy and ranking of the results) when working wi th a limited number of relevance judgments (i.e., the case when only judging the first 10 pages). Figure 3 shows some example sy stems: showing in the first column the rank position, (r), followed by the gain: g(r), (g(2) = highly relevant, g(1) = reasonably relevant, g(0) =not relevant). The next columns are the cumulative gain, cg(r), discounted cumulative gain, dcg(r), normalized discounted cumulative gain, ndcg(r), and precision, (p). Systems A, B, C, D, E, and F all show the advantages of NDCG by incor porating all levels of relevance judgment, while giving preceden ce to more relevant items. However, NDCG has some drawback s in disregarding the degree of relevancy if a system returns only documents with one level of relevancy (e.g. G &amp; H), in these systems NDCG=1, because they are considered to have a prefect order (ideal ranking) and cannot be normalized (i.e., rearrangin g the documents in descending order of relevancy). This problem also occurs if a system has only one relevant item at the top of the rank (I &amp; J); NDCG doesn X  X  distinguish between the degrees of relevancy in these cases. Moreover, in the last two systems (K, L), NDCG is equal to 0.67; though these systems differ in relevancy but both have one relevant item located at the same rank. Therefore, for the last six systems, precision is a more appropriate measure than NDCG. Precision also has its limitation as shown in the first six systems (A, B, C, D, E, F) in disregarding the location of relevant items as well as in not considering multiple relevance judgments. Therefore, examining a combination of measures appears to be
