 Despite their high priority, healthy nutrition, physical ac-tivity and other preventive health factors are rarely adopted over a long term. Traditional nutrition support systems lack of practical everyday knowledge, social support and motiva-tion as well the consideration of the personal context. We address these impediments with a holistic decision support system that empowers people to change their lifestyle suc-cessfully. We aim at analyzing previous approaches from various disciplines and integrating them into one concept for nutrition support giving personalized context aware rec-ommendations to each user while presenting and teaching practical information about healthy nutrition. Addition-ally, we consider the ease of usage of such an application by automating necessary burdens and motivating partici-pants with social incentives. The decision support system is tested in a 6-month intervention study using regression analysis on usage patterns and matrix factorial designs for interacting features. The social and interactive components are observed in a 1-year field study, utilizing a realistic en-vironment.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 38 million people (60% of deaths) annually die due to Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) [21]. Those diseases share the same four behavioral risk factors: tobacco use, unhealthy
In traditional nutritional interventions patients are guided by in-person consultation and stationary or session based medical interventions. Disadvantages of those interventions are e.g. the lack adherence to sessions [3] or the mainte-nance of changes after returning to everyday life [14]. A first step that has been taken to counteract those problems is the integration of technology into the reporting methods. [17] compared 27 nutritional interventions using technologi-cal support for diet tracking and concluded that a combina-tion with self-monitoring, counselling, group support and an individually tailored program promise even better results.
The easiest way to improve nutrition is to reduce the daily energy intake which depends on metrics such as age and gen-der and the level of physical activity. By determining the physical activity level the recommender system can adapt the recommended calorie intake to the current user state concerning energy consumption. In addition, to the pure en-ergy intake the source of energy, e.g. fat or carbohydrates, influences the healthiness of a meal. Different definitions of optimal consumption ratios between food groups are given by rule based guidelines such as the Healthy Eating Index [7] or the 10 rules of the DGE [12]. Those guidelines can be modelled for example by Food Pyramids or Decision Trees [5]. Also nutrients such as vitamins and minerals are of high relevance to preventive healthcare. One well-known concept in nutrition science is called diet optimization. It optimizes the nutrients intake while changing the habitual nutrition as little as possible in order to support easy adoption by using Fuzzy Expert Systems [9]. Another approach to judging the healthiness of food is to let users rate their meals. Research shows that the accumulated health ratings of a crowd based on meal pictures come close to the health estimate that ex-perts would give the same food [20].
There are different levels of context and personalization to be considered. From the medical point of view, the con-text of previous nutritional intake, previous physical activity and in some cases even medical states such as blood values and history of illnesses [5] are a necessary personalization for providing accurate feedback. From the convenience and user experience perspective contexts such as food availabil-ity, weather, user preferences and time [16] are deciding fac-tors for the adherence to recommendations. On a third level of abstraction, the social environment on a long term basis such as in a family or within the current situation such as a work meeting have a strong influence on the long term behavior and on habit building. For example, [8] researched the effect of familiarity and similarity of social relations to improve the adoption rate of recommended items and [2] [1] analyzed health related recommendations for families. All of these different contexts should be considered in order to improve the adherence to nutrition advice in everyday situ-ations.
In addition to modelling personalized domain knowledge, the motivation and adherence of users to presented recom-mendations strongly depends on the interface between user and system. How can the user insert data about his state
At the current stage only smaller pre-tests have been con-ducted. One study concerns motion tracking with smart-phones for school children. Another study tests advantages of different versions of a dietary diary. Nevertheless, the study design for the final holistic intervention shall be pre-sented in the following sections.
A in depth description of this study on decision support systems can be found in [18]. We plan an intervention of 6 moth, with a follow up after additional 3 months. The core of this intervention is to offer participants different ver-sions of one decision support system, that helps change their nutritional behavior by offering: (1) automated on-demand generation of personalized recommendations on a mobile de-vice, (2) easy or automated digital input of contextual infor-mation such as dietary intake and physical activity (PA), (3) motivation by integration of gadgets and blood characteris-tics, as well as (4) clear communication of the given advice by visualization and explanation. The main target group of the study are people with an BMI higher than 25. People with a normal BMI are usually already quite health aware. The System is targeting German speaking people living in Germany. In addition to German language, also the recipe and food selection will be German based. Due to lack of medical allowance of the system, people with serious dis-eases are excluded.
 The results of the interventions will be measures on a quan-tifiable medical level, as well as with qualitative measures on usage patterns. We decided on the following quantifiable variables: The second level are the qualitative measures of sustainable application usage. Those are defined as follows: The study is split into two interconnected interventions. The first intervention consists of 330 initial participants, with an expected drop-out of 50%. In this group blood measures are taken in order to personalize the recommendations to the biological factors of participants. Besides the blood per-sonalization all participants in the first intervention group receive a decision support application with the full range of functionalities. Those include: Food type based recommen-dations [5], recipe based recommendations [6][10], 7-day-recall food-frequency-questionnaire, daily dietary diary, mo-tion tracking using the smartphone or wearables, feedback
In summary this PHD project covers a nutritional decision making system, that engages users with easy in-and output functionalities, such as gamified/ automated data insertion and intrigues him with avatar-based self-quantification or explanations. It also motivates users by personalizing on specific user needs and applying social pressure to ensure long term habit development. Finally, the system provides both crowd based and expert based recommendations, as well as hybrid recommendations tailored to the users needs and contexts.
 As future work, we will conduct the described field studies and interventions. Secondly, further automation and rec-ommender techniques proposed in the researched literature will be investigated on their improvements on the system. Finally, all optimal features will be included into one mo-bile system so that we can measure the maximal effects on behavior change.
