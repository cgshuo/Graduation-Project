 Dwell time as a user behavior has been found in previous studies to be an unreliable predictor of document usefulness, with contextual factors such as the user X  X  task needing to be considered in its interpretati on. Task stage has been shown to influence search behaviors including usefulness judgments, as has task type. This paper reports on an investigation of how task stage and task type may help predict usefulness from the time that users spend on retrieved doc uments, over the course of several information seeking episodes. A 3 -stage controlled experiment was conducted with 24 participants, each coming 3 times to work on 3 sub -tasks of a general task, couched either as  X  X arallel X  or  X  X ependent X  task type. The full task was to write a report on the general topic, with interim documents produced for each sub -task. Results show that task stage can help in inferring document usefulness from decision time, especi ally in the parallel task. The findings can be used to i ncrease accuracy in predicting document usefulness and accordingly in personalizing search for multi -session tasks .

 Personalization, contextual factors in IR, dwell time, task stage, task type . Aimed at helping people find documents that meet their particular information needs , p ersonali zation of information retrieval (IR) tak es account of information about users and their contexts beyond the queries that they submit. This additional information is often obtained implicitly from user behaviors and/or contextual data, such as dwell time, t opic knowledge , and task information [1] . The time that a user spends on a retrieved document has attracted some research attention in the areas of implicit feedback and personalization of IR. It has been suggested that time al one is not a reliable factor for predicting document relevance in interactive IR; instead, it seems to differ significantly according to different tasks [6] . White &amp; Kelly [17] found that informatio n about tasks can be helpful in personalization, specifically, in setting a threshold for predicting web pages X  relevance from dwell time , in supporting implicit relevance feedback . In everyday life, information search usually happens in a certain scenari o when people have a problem to solve, a goal to attain, or a  X  X ork task X  at hand [2] [4] . It is often seen that a work task is not accomplished in one session but requires multiple sessions for vari ous reasons , such as the complexity of the task, the difficulty in locating desired information, time constraints, and so on. To study how search personalization can be applied to multi -session work tasks could result in helping people to address such task s, especially when these tasks are prolonged due to difficulties in locating useful information.
 In multi -session tasks, one task feature, task stage, seems to be more salient than in single -session (especially quick and simple) tasks. Task stage has been found to affect users X  search behaviors and search performance (e.g., [7] , [9] ). Multi -session work tasks are often complex and consist of multiple sub -tasks. Sub -task interrelationship is another s alient feature in multi -session work tasks. For example, the su btasks can be independent of one another (termed  X  X arallel X  in this paper), or they may need to be performed in some hierarchical or serial order ( termed  X  X ependent X  in this paper ) [13] . It is a pending issue whether contextual factors of task stage and task type in multi -session tasks can be helpful in implicitly predicting document usefulness, which is a key to personalization. To this end , a longitudinal study was conducted which was aimed at answering the following research questions (RQs): RQ1. Can the usefulness of retrieved documents be reliably predicted solely from the time that users have spent on them? RQ2. Does the stage of users  X  task s help predict the usefulness of retrieved documents from the time that users have spent on them ? RQ3. If the stage information helps in predicting document usefulness from time, does its role vary in different types of tasks? Task has been found in previous research to be helpful in predicting document usefulness by the user X  X  behavioral factors, such as time spent on retrieved documents. Kelly &amp; Belkin [6] found that using display time averaged ove r a group of users to predict document usefulness is not likely to be accurate, nor is it accurate using display time for a single user without taking into account contextual factors. Specifically, display time differs significantly according to specific t asks and specific users. This demonstrated that inferring the usefulness of a document from dwell time should be tailored towards individual tasks and/or users. Their study, however, did not examine how to incorporate the contextual factors and what the ac tual effectiveness would be. The issue of the influence of contextual factors was addressed by White &amp; Kelly [17] . They explored the interactions between dwell time and two contextual factors: user and task. They examined if additional information about the user and/or the task helps reliably to establish a dwell time threshold to predict document usefulness, and how effective this method would be. The results showed that tailoring display time threshold based on task informati on improved implicit relevance feedback algorithm performance. In other words, display time was shown to be able to successfully predict document usefulness when the task information is considered. This research shed light on studying the roles that other contextual factors may also play in helping predicting document usefulness from user behaviors, including the task features in multi -session tasks. Task stage has received significant research attention in terms of how it influences users X  searc h behavior and performance. It has been suggested that information seekers go through various stages or phases with different levels of information need (e.g., [7] , [9] , [11] ), and that u sers  X  feelings, thoughts, and actions vary along the different stages. This body of research indicates that stage of task may be an important factor that relates to the user X  X  judgment of document usefulness. Vakkari and colleagues (e.g., [14] , [15] , [16] ) found that users X  search tactics change along stages, for example, the ir users were , at the beginning of their tasks, less likely to start their initi al queries by introducing all the search terms, were more likely to enter only a fraction of the terms, and tended to use more synonyms and parallel terms than in later stages. They also found that users  X  relevance criteria depend on the stage of their tas k performance process , although their results did not show a statistical significance of the changes . Taylor et al. [12] found statistically significant relationships between users X  relevance criteria and task stage choices cor responding to those of selection, exploration, formulation, and presentation in Kulthau X  X  ISP model [7] . This branch of research demonstrates the differences in users X  relevance judgments in different stages of the task, howeve r, it leaves as an open issue how such differences could be modeled through the user X  X  behaviors. In addition, the above described research considered only the effect of task stage but did not correlate it with user behaviors to suggest how to build user m odels and improve system support for search. More research is needed to study how task stage can be helpful in adapting search to different users.
 It is not always easy to accurately identify task stages because they do not always have apparent boundaries. One way is to divide the logged user -system interaction data into three stages with equal time length:  X  X tart X ,  X  X iddle X , and  X  X nd X  [18] . Another way to operationalize task stage is provided by Lin [9] , in which the user X  X  task was manipulated with different sub -tasks to be completed in different search sessions. The task scenario in his study required participants to make a vacation plan through three steps in three sessions: identifying candidate places, choosing one place, and making a trip plan. Both ways to operationalize task stage are arbitrary to some extent, but the latter is closer to the situation in people X  X  everyday life when solving complex tasks. There have been many studies on task type classification (e.g., [3] , [5] , [8] ), and Li &amp; Belkin ( [8] ) have proposed an extensive scheme to classify tasks based on many d imensions of task features. Among the many task features, for work tasks which consist of multiple sub -tasks, the relationship between the sub -tasks seems salient and it is necessary to take it into account because the orders of sub -tasks may vary during t he process of accomplishing the work tasks. To our knowledge, no previous research has classified multi -session tasks based on this dimension, but similar ideas can be found in some works, for example, Toms et al. [13] which classifies single -session tasks based on their conceptual structures. The two types of tasks in their approach are: the parallel task , where the search uses multiple concepts that exist on the same level in a conceptual hierarchy, and the hie rarchical task , where the search uses a single concept for which multiple attributes or characteristics are sought. In sum, there is a relati vely rich body of previous work on tasks, but additional approaches are needed to better utilize the information th at a user X  X  task can provide to personalize search for multi -session work tasks. The study was a 3 -session controlled lab experiment, where the 3 sessions were treated as 3 stages. The design was 2*2 factorial with two between -subjects factors (Table 1). One was task type, with two levels: parallel or dependent. The other was search system, with two levels: query suggestion (QS) or non -query suggestion (NQS). These tasks and systems are described in more detail below.
 Condition Task Tasks were designed to mimic journalists X  assignments since they could be relatively easily set as realistic tasks in different domains. Among the many dimensions of task type s, e.g., in [8] , this study focus ed on task stage and sub -task interrelationship, varying them while keeping other f acets (e.g., task difficulty, task product format) a s constant as possible. Two tasks types were used in the study: one parallel and one dependent. They both ha d three sub -tasks, each of which was work ed on by the participant during one separate session, f or three session s in total.
 The tasks asked the participants to write a three -section feature story on hybrid cars for a newspaper , and to finish and submit each article section at the end of each experiment session. At the end of the 3 rd session, they wer e asked to integrate the 3 sections into one article. In the dependent task, the three sub -tasks were: 1) collect information on what manufacturers have hybrid cars; 2) select three models that you will mainly focus on in this feature story; and 3) compare the pros and cons of three models of hybrid cars. In the parallel task, the three sub -tasks were finding information and writing a report on three models of cars from auto manufacturers renown for good warranties and fair maintenance costs: 1) Honda Civic hybrid; 2) Nissan Altima hybrid, and 3) Toyota Camry hybrid. It was hypothesized that the sub -tasks in the parallel task were independent of one another, but that in the dependent task there would be perceived to be at least some notional order. To mainta in consistency , sub -task orders in task description in both tasks were rotated and users were allowed to choose whatever order of sub -task performance they preferred. In each session, participants were allowed to work up to 40 minutes to write and submit t heir reports. They were allowed to search freely on the Web for resources in report writing. For logging purpose, users were allowed to keep only one Internet Explorer (IE) window open and use back and forward buttons to move between web pages. Undergraduate Journalism/Media Studies students were invited to participate in the study via email to the student mailing list at the Journalism/Media Studies undergraduate program in the authors X  school. The first 24 students who responded and eventual ly came were study participants. Out of them, 21 were female and 3 were male. Their mean age was 20.4 years. They self reported to have an average of 8.4 years of online searching experience, and rated their levels of expertise with searching as slightly a bove average (M=5.38) (1=novice, 7=expert). Each of them came 3 times within a 2 -week period based on their schedule. Each was assigned randomly to a task/system condition. After finishing all 3 sessions, each participant obtained $30 payment. To encourage them to search in a serious manner, participants were told in the beginning of the experiment that the top 6 who submitted the most detailed reports would receive a bonus of $20. Participants came individually to a usability lab in the authors X  school to take part in the experiment. Upon arrival in the first session, they completed a consent form and a background questionnaire eliciting their demographic information and search experience. They were then given the general work task to be finished in the whole experiment. A pre -session task questionnaire followed to collect their familiarity with the general task topic. Then they were asked to pick one sub -task to work with in the current session. A pre -session sub -task questionnaire followed to collect their familiarity with the sub -task topic . Then they worked with the subtask: searching for useful sources and writing reports. After report submission, participants went through an evaluation process in which they were asked to rate on a 7 -point sca le each document that they had viewed, in the order of viewing them in the actual search process, with respect to its usefulness to the overall task. A post -session sub -task questionnaire and a post -session general task questionnaire were then administered to elicit user perceptions on the difficulty of the task and sub -task, as well as their satisfaction with their reports. This ended the first session. In the 2 nd and the 3 rd sessions, participants went through the same processes except for the consent fo rm and background questionnaire, as well as an instruction step on using query suggestion features for those assigned with the QS version system. In the 3 rd session, after the post -session general task questionnaire, an exit interview asked them to reflect their overall knowledge gain and to comment on the whole experiment. The experiment was conducted using a two -monitor workstation: the main monitor was an eye -tracker in which the users searched and worked on writing their reports ; the 2 nd monitor was a regular monitor sitting beside the search monitor, which displayed the online questionnaires and the task and sub -task descriptions. Users X  eye movements were captured but are not reported here. Logging software Morae (http://www.te chsmith.com/morae.asp ) was used to record all the user -system interactions (such as mouse and keyboard activities, window display) in the main monitor. One aspect of the study as a whole was aimed at exploring whether query terms extracted from useful pages in previous sessions were helpful for the users in their current search, and to this end, two versions of the search system were designed. One version (QS) offered query term suggestions based on previous sessions; the other (NQS) did not . F or those who were assigned to the NQ S condition, the regular IE was used throughout all three sessions. For those who were assigned to the QS condition, the regular IE was used in their first sessions, but a different interface with query term suggestio ns was provided for the second and the third sessions. This different interface (Figure 1) consist ed of two parts: the right side panel was the regular IE browser, and the user could search the open Web through whatever search engine they like ; the left -side panel display ed a list of terms extracted from their previous session(s) for the user s to select and add to their queries.
 In the literature, time that users spend on a docume nt or webpage is generally called dwell time, or reading time, or display time, but it is often not clear how this time users spent on documents was defined, although all these different names of time seem to refer to the same thing. In the curr ent study, an examination of the data as well as observation during the experiment showed that there were different types, instead of a single type, of time period that users spent on documents. These types are first explained here before other results are reported.
 At times, some docume nts were viewed and/or opened for multiple times in a session. In such cases, total dwell time (tDwT) was used in data analysis, which was the sum of the dwell time that a user spent on a document each time it was viewed . Similarly, total display time (tDi sT) was also used in data analysis, which was the sum of the total times that a document was open. For the usefulness scores of the documents viewed multiple times in a session, most of the time, the users gave the same scores to the same document opened a t multiple times . At rare times they gave different scores, in which case the final rating score was used in data analysis.
 In order to explore the relationships between/among various factors, including both the main effects and any possible interaction effects, General Linear Model (GLM) tests were conducted, where time was used as the dependent variable, and stage and usefulness were used as fac tors. Examinations of distributions of all three types of time revealed that they were far from normally distributed, which was consistent with what has been found in the literature (e.g., [6] ). As an example, Figure 3 -a shows the distribution of tDisT in both tasks combined . Similarly to what has been done in the literature, these times were transformed by logarithm using a base of 10 in data analysis for the relationships between/among factors. The transformed time data were n ormally distributed, or close to normally distributed (see the example in Figure 3 -b for the distribution of transformed tDisT), which improves the interpretability of GLM analyses. Data were analyzed for both tasks combined as well as for each task indiv idually. The original usefulness scores were on a 7 -point scale for its appropriateness for collecting user assessment [10] , but this is too fine -grained for a system to differentiate , so the scores were collapsed into groups i n the analysis similarly to what has been done in the literature (e.g., [17] ). Collapsing was based on the distribution of usefulness scores, where 1 -2 was put into a low useful group, 3 -5 into a somewhat useful group, and 6 -7 into a very useful group. The three combined groups were rather balanced in frequency. We first looked at the relations among factors of usefulness, time, and stage when no task type information was tak en into account, i.e., when both tasks in general were considered. Results indicated that (Table 2), when tDisT was used, both stage and usefulness had a significant effect . There was also a significant interaction effect between stage and usefulness (p&lt;.0 5).
 As can be seen from Figure 4-a, across all three stages, the longer a page was displayed in a session, the more useful this page was. For all documents, in general, the average page display time was longer in later stage(s) than in earlier stage(s). Th e interaction effect between stage and usefulness was shown in the following way: for not useful documents, they were displayed longer in stages 1 and 3 than in stage 2; for somewhat useful documents, the later the stages, the longer they were displayed; h owever, for very useful documents, their display time was longer in stages 2 and 3 than that in stage 1. As can be seen in Table 2, when tDwt was used, usefulness showed as the single main factor (p&lt;.001), but stage did not. Descriptively , as can be seen from Figure 4 -b, across all three stages, the longer a page was displayed in a session, the more useful this page was. For all documents, in general, the average page display time did not differ across stages, and in fact, total dwell time in stages 2 and stage 3 were almost identical. When DecT was used, neither stage nor usefulness showed a significant main effect, but the interaction between stage and usefulness showed a significant effect (p&lt;.01). Figure 4 -c shows that wh en stage information is not considered, users spent roughly the same average decision time on documents with various usefulness levels. For all documents, in general, the average decision time did not vary in different stages. However, there was an interac tion effect between stage and usefulness, demonstrated in the following way: for not useful documents, users spent longer decision time in stages 1 and 3 but shorter decision time in stage 2; for somewhat useful documents, users spent short decision time in stage 1, but much longer decision time in stage 2, and in stage 3, their decision time for somewhat useful documents was between that in stages 1 and 2; for very useful documents, users spent a long time deciding document usefulness in stage 1, but in stage 2, they spent shorter decision time, and in stage 3, their decision time was even shorter. It can be clearly seen that there is no general rule that the longer the decision tim e, the more useful the document . So decision time cannot reliably predict us efulness without consideration of information about task s tage. Relations among stage, usefulness, and time were also examined in individual tasks. In the dependent task, it was found that usefulness was the single significant factor contributing to tDisT (p&lt;.001), tDwT (p&lt;.001), as well as DecT (p&lt;.05). Stage did not play a significant role contributing to any type of time . Across all three stages, the longer a page was displayed in a session, the more usefu l this page was (Figure 5 -a). For all documents, in general, the average page display time did not have differences in the three stages . As can be seen from Figure 5-b, across all three stages, the longer the users dwelled on a page, the more useful th is page was. For all document s, in general, the average total dwell time did not have differences in three stages. In fact, total dwell time in stage 2 and that in stage 3 were almost identical. When DecT was used , the findings were essentially the same as those using tDisT or tDwT. Although Figure 5 -c looks a bit different from Figures 5 -a and 5 -b, there was no statistically significant difference. A cross all three stages, the longer the decision time, the more useful the page was. For all documents, the average decision time did not show differences in the three stages. In the parallel task, the patterns of relationships among time, stage, and usefulness were similar to those obtained when both tasks were examined together . In contrast, they were very different to those obtained in the dependent task alone . When tDisT was used, usefulness had a significant effect (p&lt;.001) but stage did not. As can be seen from Figure 6 -a, across al l three stages, the longer a page was displayed in a session, the more useful this page was. For all documents, when their usefulness levels are not differentiated, the average page display time did not have differences in three stages. Wh en tDwT was used, usefulness had a significant effect (p&lt;.001) but stage did not. As can be seen from Figure 6 -b, across all three stages, the longer the user dwelled on a page, the more useful this page was. For all documents, when their usefulness levels are not differentiated, the average total dwell time did not have differences in the three stages. Time Type tDisT 4.15(.016) 123.78(.000) 2.66(.032) 1.96(.142) 63.40 (.000) 1.91(.108) 2.40(.092) 61.11(.000) 1.39(.236) tDwT 1.68(.187) 75.40(.000) .82(.514) 1.29(.276) 35.23(.000) .83(.507)
DecT .33(.722) 2.16(.116) 3.62(.006) .79(.454) 3.34(.036) 1.57(.180) (Those in bold were significant.) When DecT was used , neither usefulness nor stage had a significant effect, but their interaction did (p&lt;.05) (Figure 6-c). In stage 1, users spent the shortest decision time for medium useful document and the longest decision time for very useful documents . I n stage 2, they spent shorter decision time on low usefulness and very u seful documents but longer decision time on somewhat useful documents . I n stage 3, they spent the shortest time for very useful documents and the longest time for medium useful documents. These results indicated that in the parallel task, stage played a si gnificant role contributing to DecT. There is a need to look at the possible effect of system version on the above results since participants used 2 versions of the system. It was found that compared with the participants who were ass igned to the NQS condition, those assigned to the QS condition had less initial knowledge on task topics even before they worked with their sub -tasks in session 1. Therefore, the 2 groups of users were not sampled from the same population, which accordingl y ma kes it inappropriate to conduct any comparison between these 2 groups of users with respect to system performance. This also suggests that we need to treat all participants as a whole instead of examining each group independently for analyses on the ef fect of task stage and task type. In addition, it was found that system condition did not seem to confound the relationship s discovered because it did not have a significant main effect on users X  decision time, nor did it have a significant interaction eff ect with usefulness on decision time. Among the three types of time, tDisT and tDwT both measured time at the whole session level. These times cannot be captured until a session is finished , so their applicabili ty for personalizing search for the current session is limited. They may be nonetheless useful as a basis for personalizing subsequent search sessions . On the other hand, DecT can be captured in a much earlier phase in a session; therefore, it can be used for adapting search in the current session in addition to subsequent sessions , making it more useful for immediate personalization than the other two types of time. Results showed that in both tasks combined , i.e., when ta sk type was not distinguished, usefulness had a significant main effect on tDwT. This is reasonable given the fact that the users often moved back and forth between reading document s and writing report s, and those documents which had longer dwell time were more likely to be useful. This finding indicates that when task type was not distinguished, tDwT was a rather reliable predictor of usefulness . However , when tDisT or DecT was used, neither of them seemed able to reliably predict usefulness. In the depen dent task, all three types of time, tDisT, tDwT, and DecT, appear ed to be able to reliably predict usefulness. In contrast, in the parallel task, tDisT and tDwT were shown to be able to reliably predict usefulness, but DecT was not. In sum, tDwT was shown to be able to reliably predict usefulness in both tasks combined , and for both the parallel and the dependent task. tDisT can predict usefulness in the parallel and the dependent task s individually , but not in both tasks combined . In contrast, DecT can on ly predict usefulness in the dependent task. Considering the practical limitation that tDwT and tDisT can be captured only at the end of the task session , if one is to use time alone as a reliable predictor of usefulness to personalize for the current sess ion , only DecT is available and so one can only make predictions for the dependent task . Time Type tDisT Single  X   X   X  Following With stage  X  Following tDw T Single  X   X   X  Following Dec T Single  X  Current /following With stage  X   X  Current /following (Note: Depd.: dependent task; Para.: parallel task) Although in the dependent task, stage did not seem to play a role in contributing to use of any of the three types of time, in the parallel task and in both tasks together, stage was found to have significant main or interaction effects. Specifically, in both tasks combined , stage had a significant main effect as well as a significant interaction effect with usefulness on tDisT. Stage also had a significant interaction effect with usefulness on DecT. In the parallel task, stage had a significant interacti on effect with usefulness on DecT. Task stage plays a role in predicting usefulness from tDisT in both tasks combined. This role can be used for subsequent search/work sessions but it cannot be applied to the ongoing session due to the limitation that tDi sT cannot be captured until the end of a session. However, the role that task stage plays in predicting usefulness from DecT can be applied to the ongoing session. The significant interaction effects between stage and usefulness on DecT in both tasks combi ned and in the parallel task are important because in these tasks, usefulness in fact did not have any main effect. This indicates that in both tasks combined and in the parallel task, DecT alone cannot predict usefulness, but by taking into account task s tage information, it can. However, it should also be noted that although the above mentioned interaction effects between stage and usefulness were significant, the effect size was not large (partial eta squared was .015 in both tasks combined and .022 in the parallel task).
 In sum, when no task type was distinguished, task stage was found to help in predicting usefulness from tDisT, which can be used for personalization in subsequent work/search sessions in a multi -session task. When no task type was distin guished, or in the parallel task, task stage was found to be an important factor to take account of when predicting usefulness from DecT, which can be used for personalizing search for the ongoing session. These findings are helpful for personalizing sear ch for specific users in that decision time can help predict the usefulness of documents given the task stage and task type information. In addition, unlike the tDwT which would not be available until a session is over, DecT can be easily obtained in an ea rly phase of a session. Our results show that in the dependent task, task stage did not play a role in predicting document usefulness, but in the parallel task, it did. A likely explanation is that in the dependent task, sub -tasks that the users worked with in the three sessions were different not only in their topics, but also in the sub -task patterns. However, in the parallel task, sub -tasks that the users worked on in the three sessions differed only in their topics; they had the same sub -task patterns , and users only changed car models across sessions. This made it possible for users to gain knowledge across stages regarding the usefulness of some documents . T herefore, their decision time on useful documents in later stages was shorter, while in the dep endent task, it was still long.
 When task information was not specified, stage also played a role. This is due, we think, to the strong role of task stage in the parallel task. Although infer ring document usefulness based on time and stage still works while ignoring task type, it will enhance the prediction accuracy by consideri ng this task type information. The findings reported here are only about examination of the role of t ask stage in multi -session tasks in personalization. There are certainly other factors that may also play significant roles in usefulness prediction, for example, users X  knowledge of the task topics. This was elicited in the experiment and will be analyzed in future studies. Also, it would also be interesting to examine the 2 , the 3 rd , and more dwell times besides the 1 st dwell time (i.e., DecT) with respect to how they can be used for personalization. In addition, the results in this paper showed that ta sk stage is an important contextual factor to be considered in predicting usefulness from time. Nevertheless, more work is needed to estimate the extent that task stage can help. Further studies will also design and build systems that automatically persona lize search based on time t hreshold and stage information. In this paper, we examin ed the relation ship s among task stage, task type, document usefulness, and three types of time . Decision time can be used for p ersonaliz ing search for an ongoing session as well as for subsequent sessions . It was found that in the parallel task, one needs to take account of task stage in order to accurately predict usefulness from decision time . However, this is not the case with the dependent task . This suggests that it is important to be able to identify task type in addition to task stage in order to predict document usefulness based on decision time . Total display time and total dwell time can be used for personalizing search for subsequent sessions in multi -session tasks. Either of them alone appears to be a reliable indicator of document usefulness, and task stage and task type information does not necessarily need to be considered. While t hese findings can only be generalized to the task types and task stages as defined in this paper, they suggest that there may be similar results when considering other task types, and other definitions of task stage .
