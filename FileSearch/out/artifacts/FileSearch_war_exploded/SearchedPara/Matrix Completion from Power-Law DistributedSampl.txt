 Formally, for an unknown matrix M  X  R m  X  n of rank at most k , given  X   X  [ m ]  X  [ n ] , P k , the low-rank matrix completion problem is to find a matrix X  X  R m  X  n such that graph G more realistic random graph models for the sampling graph G for complete cascades in random graphs -a problem of independent interest. [6] (CLV model), we show that ICMC solves the matrix completion problem for sampling graphs drawn from the CLV model. The bounds we obtain for matrix-com pletion on the CLV model are accuracy and time -the methods of [4, 5, 3, 13] by an order of ma gnitude. In summary, our main contributions are: alternating minimization and its variants [2, 15, 18]. do not satisfy the restricted isoperimetry property they assume. [6, 19]).
