 The benefits of crowdsourcing are well-recognized today for an in-creasingly broad range of problems. Meanwhile, the rapid devel-opment of social media makes it possible to seek the wisdom of a crowd of targeted users. However, it is not trivial to implement the crowdsourcing platform on social media, specifically to make so-cial media users as workers, we need to address the following two challenges: 1) how to motivate users to participate in tasks, and 2) how to choose users for a task. In this paper, we present Wise Mar-ket as an effective framework for crowdsourcing on social media that motivates users to participate in a task with care and correctly aggregates their opinions on pairwise choice problems. The Wise Market consists of a set of investors each with an associated indi-vidual confidence in his/her prediction, and after the investment, only the ones whose choices are the same as the whole market are granted rewards. Therefore, a social media user has to give his/her  X  X  X est X  X  answer in order to get rewards, as a consequence, careless answers from sloppy users are discouraged.

Under the Wise Market framework, we define an optimization problem to minimize expected cost of paying out rewards while guaranteeing a minimum confidence level, called the Effective Mar-ket Problem (EMP) . We propose exact algorithms for calculating the market confidence and the expected cost with O ( n log cost in a Wise Market with n investors. To deal with the enor-mous number of users on social media, we design a Central Limit Theorem-based approximation algorithm to compute the market confidence with O ( n ) time cost, as well as a bounded approxima-tion algorithm to calculate the expected cost with O ( n ) Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments to validate ef-fectiveness of the proposed algorithms on real and synthetic data.

The wisdom of crowds has long been known, but only with the development of online services has it becomes possible to enroll and manage the crowd X  X  work effectively and handle payments efficiently. On traditional crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), task holders post their tasks onto a pub-lic task pool and wait for workers to choose them. Once the tasks are completed, workers are paid via the crowdsourcing platform. These centralized crowdsourcing platforms contribute greatly to fa-cilitate the power of crowds. However, there are certain natural drawbacks of this mechanism: 1) Payments are only weakly asso-ciated with the quality of the work from crowd workers, so some workers try to maximize income by giving answers fast, even to the extent of giving random answers; 2) Task holders cannot ac-tively choose the workers. Rather they have to accept anyone who shows up and meets the published criteria, thereby having very lim-ited control on the quality of workers recruited, and hence on the quality of work produced; And 3) The crowd tends to be from a re-stricted demographic class [ 10], which may produce biased results when demographics matter.

Users of social media services can be a huge reservoir of work-ers for crowdsourcing: 1) Users of social media range over a much broader demographics, and of course, a larger population; 2)Infor-mation in the users X  profile can be used to infer some of their in-terests and abilities; 3) Task holders can actively enroll targeted workers using built-in functions like  X  X  X  (in Tiwtter) or private messages (in Facebook). Therefore, there is an emerging notion of "managed crowdsourcing" [ 5, 6], where workers are actively cho-sen. In this paper, we present WiseMarket as an effective frame-work to support such managed crowdsourcing, for tasks are two-option decision making problems. To this end, we tackle two es-sential challenges: how to motivate users to participate in tasks, and how to choose users for tasks.

Markets are known to be an effectiv e institution for aggregating beliefs of online users and yielding reliable answers. For exam-ple, in Racetrack Betting [ 8] investors are only allowed to choose from two options, and the promised rewards are only given to the investors whose investment meets the market opinion (the major-ity of all investors). We use this idea as the basis for our frame-work. Online users are considered investors in this market, while the social media is treated as a collective knowledge base. Thus, a wise market includes a set of investors, each associated with a probability ( individual confidence ) that he or she will give the cor-rect answer. The system maintains a pool of candidate users while evaluating the users X  confidence simultaneously. When a particu-lar task comes, the system recommends an optimal subset of users and releases the task to them with promise of a reward. After their choices, the answer preferred by a majority of the users will be out-put as the market opinion and the ones who make the same choice as the market are granted a reward. Note that the output is the ma-jority of the market, not necessarily the same as the ground truth. The probability that the market opinion meets the ground truth is considered as the Market Confidence . The expected total reward payout is the Market Cost borne by the task-owner. Then the prob-lem of building an  X  X  X ffective X  X  market is to find a set of investors from all possible users, whose Market Cost is minimum subject to its Market Confidence satisfying a given threshold. We show the problem with the following example.

E XAMPLE 1. Consider a candidate set of investors (social me-dia users) A (0 . 8) ,B (0 . 6) ,C (0 . 7) ,D (0 . 8) ,E (0 . 5) date investor has an individual confidence as in brackets, and the task-owner has a market confidence threshold  X  =0 . 85 . Our prob-lem is to find a set of investors who have the minimum market cost subject to the market confidence threshold.

First, we try the market, WM 1 = { A (0 . 8) ,C (0 . 7) ,D (0 . 8) following the majority rule, WM 1 works correctly only when at least two investors make the correct choice. Specifically, there are in total four out of eight cases that the market provides the correct answers as shown in Table 1. In the first 4 cases, the number of correct investors are in a majority(i.e. no less than 2). We obtain the probability that the entire m arket performs correctly( Market Confidence ) by summing up the probab ilities of the first 4 cases, i.e. MC ( WM 1 )=0 . 448 + 0 . 112 + 0 . 192 + 0 . 1912 = 0 . 864 .
Turning to the cost, we need to pay three units for case 1, and two units each for cases 2,3,4. Note that even when the market does not give the correct answer as in the last 4 cases, payments still need to be made to the majority of the investors. We denote the investors in majority as a Winning Set , whose size determines the payment. The expected value of cost E [ Cost ]=3  X  ( Prob. of Case 1 and 8 )+ 2  X  ( Prob. of Case 2 to 7 )=2 . 46 .

If we instead selected WM 2 = { B (0 . 6) ,C (0 . 7) ,D (0 . 8) turns out that WM 2 has a market confidence of 0.788 and an ex-pected cost of 2 . 36 . WM 2 is more  X  X  X heaper X  X  than WM 1 ever, since the given threshold is  X  =0 . 85 , WM 2 does not satisfy the confidence threshold. In such a case, WM 1 is the answer.
In this paper, to address the problem of building an effective wise market on social media, we have made the following contributions:
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. A formal definition of the problem is presented in Section 2. In Section 3, we study the calculation of Market Confidence and present both exact and approximate algorithms and in Section 4, we study the structure of calculating Market Cost and propose both exact and approxima-tion algorithms. Then, in Section 5, we build upon the work in the preceding two sections to present the overall Effective Market Algorithm(EMA). In Section 6, we empirically study the intrinsic characteristics of the problem and the performance of the proposed algorithms. Finally, in Section 7, we summarize the most recent related work, and conclude in Section 8.
In a Wise Market , each investor works on tasks, each of which is to make a choice between two given options. The task may have a (latent) ground truth, but this is not known to us. (Some tasks may have a ground truth that is difficult to characterize --e.g. which of two logos is more "eye-catching".) When the option selected is the same as the aggregate market choice (not necessarily the latent ground truth), the investor receives a reward of one unit. Investors make decisions based on their experience and general knowledge, and there is a chance that an investor fails to identify the true value of the target. So for an investor  X  i , we define the individual confi-dence c i to describe how likely an investor is to choose correctly, and we use another variable v i  X  X  0 , 1 } to denote its actual vote between the two choices.
  X  ,the Investor Confidence c i is the probability that  X  i chooses the same option as the ground truth. where G is the ground truth, the confidence c i is a probability of making the correct choice, and there are two standard ways to eval-uate it. First, confidence could be estimated from the frequency of correct judgments, which could be implemented by analyzing pre-vious records or inserting tasks with known answers [ 12]. Second, since the probability reflects the subjective degree of the belief, the confidence c i can also be estimated by associating the relative au-thoritativeness of users [6 ].
A Wise Market is a set of investors along with rules to aggregate the market information and issue rewards to successful investors. Assume I = {  X  1 , X  2 ,..., X  N } is the set of all investors, we define a Wise Market as follows:
D EFINITION 2( Wise Market ). A Wise Market is a set of in-vestors WM n = {  X  1 , X  2 ,..., X  n } X  I with size n , where each is associated with an individual confidence c i and actual vote
The most popular aggregation rule is Majority Voting ,which presents the opinions of the majority of investors as output. We denote such output as the Market Opinion and present the formal definition as follows: D EFINITION 3(M ARKET O PINION ). Given a Wise Market WM , the Market Opinion OP ( WM n ) is the aggregated result according to the following equation: To avoid the cumbersome special case where the vote is tied, in this paper we study the case where the size of a Wise Market is ODD .
As an institution for aggregatin g the distribut ed knowledge, the quality of a Wise Market is measured according to the probability that the market successfully identifies the true value of a task. For better illustration, we first define the concept of Truth Set {  X  |  X  i  X  WM n s.t. v i = G } , which includes the investors whose answers are identical to the ground truth G .
 dence MC is defined as the probability t hat the Market Opinion is the same as the ground truth G : where F k = { A | A | = k,A  X  WM n } is all the subsets of with size k and A c is the complementary set of A . Another significant concept for a Wise Market is the Market Cost . We assume that unit rewards are granted to the winning investors. In such a setting, the market cost is numerically equal to the number of winning investors in a market, in other words, the size of the majority in a market.

We define the concept of Winning Set as the set of investors who have the same opinion as the market opinion. We then formally define the Market Cost as follows:
D EFINITION 5(M ARKET C OST ). Given a Wise Market WM n , the Market Cost, Cost ( WM n ) , is the size of the Winning Set : Cost ( WM n )= W = {  X  i |  X  i  X  WM n s.t. v i = OP ( WM n
Note that, only when OP ( WM n )= G ,thetwosets W and C are equal, otherwise | W | + | C | = n .
 The Market Cost varies according to different constitution of Wise Market , and to measure the effectiveness of a Wise Market , we present the concept of Expected Market Cost, which follows the definition of expected value: Formally, we define the Effective Market Problem as follows: of investors I = {  X  1 ,..., X  N } with size N , a Market Confidence threshold  X  , the Effective Market Problem( EMP )istofindasubset of all investors WM n  X  I , so that:
There are three main subproblems to be studied to build up an effective Wise Market from a given set of investors, the first one is to efficiently calculate the Market Confidence, the second one is to calculate the Market Cost, and the third one is to efficiently pinpoint the most effective subset of all investors as a market. We study each of these sub-problems in turn in the following three sub-sections.
Based on Definition 4, the Market Confidence aims to compute the probability that the size of C is no less than n 2 . Actually, the size of C ( C ) is considered to be a discrete random variable. Therefore, the probability mass function of C is shown as fol-lows, For the corresponding probab ilities of differe nt values of store them in a vector.

In order to compute the Market Confidence efficiently, we pro-pose a divide-and-conquer-based exact algorithm ( Algorithm DC in Figure 1). The algorithm first divides the set of investors into two groups, WM n 1 and WM n 2 , as long as WM n does not have a single member in lines 1-2. Then, the algorithm recursively computes the probability mass function of C in the two parti-tioned groups in lines 3-4. As a consequence, we get two vectors of size n 2 (when n is even), to store the probability distribution of in
WM n 1 and WM n 2 , respectively. In fact, the probability of each possible value of global C can be considered as the convolution of corresponding proba bilities in two partiti oned groups. Accord-ing to the concept of convolution, the correspondi ng proba bilities of each value of C in n investors can be represented as: where Vec lower and Vec upper are used to store the probability dis-tribution of C in WM n 1 and WM n 2 , respectively. Moreover, in order to speedup the recursive computation of convolution, we employ the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform(iFFT) in line 5. In addition, the algorithm ex-its in lines 8-10. Thus, based on Algorithm DC , we can obtain the probability distribution of C and compute MC ( WM n ) of the given set of investors WM n easily. Algorithm MCA (Figure 2) shows the details of computing market confidence of WM n .
Back to the running example, we illustrate Algorithm DC in Fig-ure 3: We first split the set of { A, C, D } into two smaller sets {
A } and { C,D } , and recursively split { C,D } into { C } and { Then we merge the smaller sets using convolution, and FFT and iFFT are adopted to speedup the process.

Computational Complexity Analysis: In line 5 of Algorithm DC , the computation cost of the FFT-based convolution is O ( n log n ) where n is the size of WM n . Thus, the whole complexity of Algorithm DC is O ( n log 2 n ) . Consequently, the exact market con-fidence can be computed by Algorithm MCA with computational complexity of O ( n log 2 n ) .
According to Definition 6, we only need to test whether the mar-ket confidence of WM n is larger than the given threshold and need not to get the exact value of MC ( WM n ) . Thus, we are interested only in an efficient checking method. In this part, we include a tight upper bound of MC ( WM n ) to help speed up the checking. L EMMA 1. (Chernoff-Inequality -based Bounding) Given a Wise Market WM n , a market confidence threshold  X  , MC ( WM n isfies the following upper bound, where =  X 
Note that due to the limit of the space, proofs of all the lemmas in this paper can be found in the technical report [ 7].
Based on Lemma 1, we only spend O ( n ) time to check whether the upper bound satisfies the confidence threshold.
As we discussed above, the Ch ernoff-Inequality -based bounding technique of MC ( WM n ) can improve the efficiency of the exact solution by employing the upper bound to check whether the set can be pruned. Then, we perform Algorithm MCA if the set fails to be filtered. However, in a real social network, which features a large number of candidate users, the computational cost is still high, especially when the set of investors fail to satisfy the market confidence threshold and cannot be filtered by t he above pruning method. In this subsection, we propose an efficient Central-Limit-Theorem-based approximation algorithm which not only has linear computational complexity but also returns the result with a high confidence. The basic idea is to use the probability density function of a Standard Normal distribution to replace the probability mass function of C according to the Central Limit Theorem. Thus, MC ( WM n ) can be approximately computed by the probability density function of a Standard Normal distribution. In the follow-ing, we firstly prove that the probability distribution of verges in probability to a Standard Normal distribution, and then propose our approximation algorithm.

T HEOREM 1. (Central Limit Theorem of the probability distri-bution of C ) Given a Wise Market WM n , MC ( WM n ) con-verges in probability t o a Standard Normal dis tribution, namely where =  X 
P ROOF . For each investor associated with individual confidence c , we denote  X  i as the random event that  X  i invests correctly , which follows the Binomial distribution. Thus, the expectation and variance of  X  i are E (  X  i )= c i and Var (  X  i )= c i (1 tively. For a given Wise Market WM n , C = n i =1  X  i ,sothe expectation and variance of C are Because different  X  i may have different c i ,  X  1 ... X  n dent and may not follow a same distribution. Based on the Lya-punov X  X  Central Limit Theorem, t he probability distribution of converges in probability to a Sta ndard Normal distribution iff the following two conditions hold: 1 .E [ |  X  i | ] 2+  X  is finite where  X &gt; 0( i =1 , ..., n ) 2 . lim
For the first condition, it is obviously correct because E (  X  Var (  X  i ) are finite. And the second condition is also satisfied based on the existence of a suitable  X  . A detailed proof can be found in our technical report [ 7].
 Based on Theorem 1, we design an approximate algorithm(see Algorithm CLT-MC in Figure 4) to compute MC ( WM n ) efficiently. In Algorithm CLT-MC , the expectation and the variance  X  of
C are accumulated in lines 2-4, respectively. Then, in line 5, the MC ( WM n ) can be obtained by a hash function which maps different expectations and variances to the corresponding probabil-ities under a Standard Normal distribution.

Back to the running example, while = E ( | C | )=0 . 8+0 . 8+ 0 . 7=2 . 3 and  X  = Var ( | C | )= as the data size increases, the approximated value gets closer to the real value. Please refer to Figure 8(g) and Figure 8(i) . Computational Complexity Analysis: In Algorithm CLT-MC , the computational complexity is only O ( n ) where n is the size of Wise Market WM n because we only accumulate the expectation and the variance of C . Moreover, since we implement the probability calculation of the Standard Nor-mal distribution via a hashing function, line 5 only requires O (1)
Besides testing the market confidence requirement, calculating the market cost is another important task of the Effective Market Problem . In this section, we design an exact and an approximation algorithms to compute the market cost, respectively.
In this subsection, we focus on how to compute the market cost exactly. Based on Definition 5, we can find that it is easy to com-pute after the probability distribution of C is known. Thus, the basic idea of the exact algorithm is to compute the expected market cost directly from the probability distribution of C . More details are shown in Algorithm EEC (Figure 5).

In Algorithm EEC , it first calls Algorithm DC to obtain the prob-ability distribution of C in line 1. Then, according to Definition 5, the expected market cost is computed in lines 2-6 and the final mar-ket cost is returned in line 7.

Computational Complexity Analysis: Because Algorithm EEC employs Algorithm DC in line 1, this step spends O ( n log putational cost where n is the size of the Wise Market . In lines 2-6, the algorithm spends O ( n ) time cost. Thus, the total compu-tational complexity of Algorithm EEC is O ( n log 2 n )+ O O ( n log 2 n ) .
In order to compute the market cost efficiently, we also introduce an approximation algorithm which has linear computational com-plexity and a constant approximation ratio. Before we discuss the approximation algorithm, we introduce a pair of lower and upper bounds of the expected market cost via the following two lemmas. L EMMA 2. (Lower Bound of Expected Market Cost) Given a Wise Market WM n , the following inequality holds: where each c i is the invest confidence of each  X  i .
 In addition to the lo wer bound of the expected market cost in Lemma 2, we also find the upper bound of the expected market cost in the following lemma.
 L EMMA 3. (Upper Bound of Expected Market Cost) Given a Wise Market WM n , and a market confidence threshold  X  , the fol-lowing inequality holds:
Based on the aforementioned upper bound of the expected mar-ket cost, we can use the upper bound instead of the expected market cost as the approximation result and guarantee that the approxima-tion result is at most (3  X  2  X  ) times larger than the exact result in the following theorem.
 T HEOREM 2. (Approximation Ratio of Approximate Expected Market Cost) Given a Wise Market WM n , a market confidence threshold  X  , the upper bound in Lemma 3 is at most 3  X  2 larger than the exact expected market cost.
 P ROOF (Sketch) . According to the probability distribution of we can do the following transformation.
Then, we know that 2 E [ Cost ( WM n )] = According to the upper bound of expected market cost in Lemma 3, E [ Cost ( WM n )] &lt; &lt; &lt;E [ Cost ( WM n )] + 2(1  X   X  )  X  E [ Cost ( WM n )] ( Lemma 2) =(3  X  2  X  )  X  E [ Cost ( WM n )] Therefore, the upper bound of the expected market cost is at most (3  X  2  X  ) times of the exact result.

Based on Theorem 2, we can design an approximation algorithm which has (3  X  2  X  )  X  approximation ratio in Algorithm AEC (Figure 6). In Algorithm AEC , we firstly compute , the expectation of in lines 1-2. Then, we return an approximation result in line 3.
Back to the running example, according to the results in Sec-tion 3(Figure 3), we can obtain the exact cost E [ Cost ( WM 0 . 012  X  3+0 . 124  X  2+0 . 416  X  2+0 . 448  X  3=2 . 46 . While using Algo-rithm 6, we could obtain an approximate value of E [ Cost ( WM 2 . 3+3  X  (1  X  0 . 85) = 2 . 75 , where the threshold  X  =0 . 85 and the algorithm achieves an approximation ratio equal to 1.1. Computational Complexity Analysis:
Because Algorithm AEC only needs to compute the expectation of C , the total computational complexity of Algorithm AEC is O ( n ) .
In this section, we discuss the strategy to solve the effective mar-ket problem by integrating both algorithms of computing the mar-ket confidence and the expected market cost. According to the def-inition of the expected market cost, there is not any monotonicity or anti-monotonicity between the subset/superset relationship. So we have to enumerate all possible subsets of the N investors and then check their market confidences and the expected market costs via our solutions discussed above. Therefore, an effective and effi-cient heuristic algorithm for the e ffective market problem is shown by the following filtering-and-verification framework.
First Step: We first check whether there exists at least one in-vestor whose market confidence is no less than the market confi-dence threshold  X  . If so, the effective market only includes the investor who has the smallest but threshold-satisfying confidence among all the given investors, and then the algorithm stops. Actu-ally, it is equal for any eligible investor to be selected when the size of the effective market is one. However, for the case that the size of the effective market is more than one, an effective heuristic rule is that invertors with the smallest confidence are tried firstly because the unqualified markets can be safely pruned in O ( n ) time com-plexity (Lemma 1 and Algorithm DC ). On the contrary, we have to spend O ( nlog 2 n ) time complexity to test the unqualified markets. Therefore, we still select the investor with the smallest confidence when the size of market is one to keep the consistent strategy style.
Second Step: If there is no single investor as the effective mar-ket, we will enumerate all possible subsets. The main heuristic rule is to search from the smallest market to the larger ones, and test from the combination of investors with smallest confidence to that with higher confidence. Thus, if the Chernoff inequality-based upper bound of a subset is smaller than  X  , this subset can be fil-tered.( Filtering Phase )
Third Step: For the subsets of all investors that cannot be pruned, we compute their expected market costs and find the minimum one. ( Verification Phase )
Note that in the first step, we select the investors with the small-est confidence for quickly finding the eligible crowd with the min-imum number of investors. Based on the framework above, in the worst case, this solution is O (2 N ) where N is the size of all the given investors. For a large amount of data, it is expensive to use this exact method to find the effective market. Therefore, accord-ing to the approximation algorithm of the expected market cost in Algorithm AEC , we propose an efficient approximation algorithm to discover the effective market in Algorithm EMA (Figure 7). The basic idea is to search for an effective market in the increasing or-der of size. For the subsets of same size, we can rank them by their approximation expected Market Cost ( Algorithm AEC )inan ascending order. Once we find a subset whose market confidence is greater than  X  , we stop and return this subset as the final effective market. More details can be found in Algorithm EMA .Beforedis-cussion of Algorithm EMA , we propose a pruning method called Early Termination to speed up the algorithm.

L EMMA 4. (Early Termination) Given a set of investors I = {  X  1 , X  2 ,..., X  N } , a subset M  X  I which has the current minimum market cost( CMC ) so far, a market confidence threshold  X  algorithm of EMP can stop if and only if CMC  X  MC ( M min where M min contains | M | +2 investors with the smallest individ-ual confidence c i .

In Algorithm EMA , we firstly check whether the largest proba-bility among N investors is larger than the confidence threshold  X  . If so, we can directly return the investor who has the minimum probability among investors whose probabilities are not less than  X  in line 1. Otherwise, we continue to check other subsets of the N investors in lines 3-12. We first perform the Early Termination pruning of Lemma 4 in lines 5-6. Then, for the set of all subsets whose size is i, S i , we use the function RankMerge ( S i erate all (i+2)-size subsets by merging any two i-size subsets and to rank them according to the combinatorial order of their ranked con-fidences in line 7, e.g. &lt;c 1 ,c 2 ,c 5 &gt; ranks before If there exists at least one subset whose market confidence is no less than  X  , we find the subsets which have the smallest expected market cost among all (i+2)-size subsets whose market confidences are no less than  X  (lines 8-10). In addition, in lines 11-12, we di-rectly terminate the process to check any (i+2)-size subset if all i-size subsets fail to satisfy the confidence threshold  X 
In this section, we present a series of empirical studies of the performance of our proposed algorithms. All experiments are con-ducted on a PC with 2 Intel(R) Core(TM) 2.13GHz CPU and 2GB memory, running on Microsoft 64-bit Windows 7.

Since WiseMarket is designed as an advanced tool for the enterprise-level task-holders, our empirical studies are conducted for evaluat-ing the effectiveness and efficiency of the tool.

Synthetic datasets are generated to explore the intrinsic char-acteristics of the problems and algorithms; and real datasets are adopted to evaluate the usability of the algorithms. Therefore, we estimate the confidence from both ranking-based method [ 8]and benchmark-based method [ 15] on a collection of Weibo 1 data with 1,200 users, which could serve as a real distribution of the confi-dence among social online users. The Weibo service is a rapid growing platform in Chinese web community, and we choose it as a representative example for online user distribution. In addition, synthetic data sets include both normal distribution and Zipf distri-bution. The Zipf distribution is pervasively observed in Internet-related phenomenon, and become one of the most verified laws in the networks associated with human behaviors[ 1]. The basic fact of Zipf distribution is that in social networks, there is a log-linear relationship between the size and the rank of certain groups of indi-viduals. The distribution is described by a skew-factor s how quickly the size decreases according to its rank.
 To better study the inherent computational characteristics of the EMP , we conduct an empirical study to test the intrinsic traits of MC and Cost , and the performance of our algorithms for calcula-tion of MC , Cost ,and EMP .
The characteristics of the Market Confidence and Market Cost over different datasets are our major interest. We generate a set of datasets following normal distribution, with varying mean value from 0.1 to 0.9 and variance from 0.1 to 0.3 respectively. Each dataset includes 1,000 candidate investors.

The results are shown in Figure 8(a) and Figure 8(b) . We see that when the given mean approaches 0.5, the MC increases rapidly to 1. This indicates that a reliable Wise Market may be established from a relatively small group of investors. Note that when the vari-ance is small(e.g. var =0 . 1 ), the convergence is much more (g) Efficiency of Cal. MC(Z) (i) Effectiveness of Cal. MC(N) (k) Effectiveness of Cal. MC(Z) obvious since it is a closer approximation to Binomial Distribution. Another interesting phenomenon is in Figure 8(b) ,wherethemar-ket with lowest Market Cost is achieved by the investors with mean of 0.5. In such Wise Market , the probability density distribution of the size of Winning Set in a Wise Market is close to n 2 . Conceptu-ally, either too many wise investors or too many careless investors will cause a large size of W inningSet , which incurs higher and renders the Wise Market  X  X  X neffective X  X .

To further observe the characteristics of MC according to the change of the size of the given Wise Market , we run the algorithm on datasets with varying size from 10 to 90, where datasets from Normal distribution have mean from 0.3 to 0.7 and variance of 0.2, and of Zipf distribution have skew-factor s from 0.3 to 0.7. The results are shown from Figure 8(c) to Figure 8(d) . In Figure 8(c) ,it is shown that the MC is very sensitive to the given mean value of the Wise Market .Forthe Wise Market whose mean value is above 0.5, the MC grows very sharply to 1 with increasing of the market size. Note that for Zipf Distribution, the MC decreases quickly to almost zero. It is because in the datasets of Zipf distribution, most of the investors have low confidence.
Based on the intrinsic traits of MC and Cost , in this subsection we evaluate the performance, including efficiency and effective-ness, of our proposed algorithms.
 Efficiency
We compare the efficiency among all proposed algorithms for calculating MC and Cost . The datasets have varying size from 100 to 800. In addition, for Normal distribution, the mean is set as 0.7 and the variance is set as 0.2; for Zipf distribution, the parame-ter s is set as 0.7.

We conduct Algorithm DC and Algorithm MCA to calculate ex-act MC value(denoted as exact ), and we also conduct Algorithm based on Lemma 1 and Algorithm CLT-MC to fetch the upper bound (denoted as chnf ) and the approximated values (denoted as clt ). All results are shown from Figure 8(e) to 8(h) . The results show great efficiency speedup by utilizing t he upper bounding tech-nique and Central Limit Theorem-based approximation algorithm. It can be observed that the time cost of exact algorithms exhibits an O ( n  X  log 2 n ) increasing tendency.
 Effectiveness
The datasets are generated following a normal distribution with mean 0.6 and variance 0.2. For the Zipf distribution, the generated datasets have skew-factor s 0.2. All datasets are studied with num-ber of nodes varying from 10 to 90. The results are shown from Figure 8(i) to Figure 9(b) . The result in Figure 8(i) shows the close approximation between the exact value( X  X  exact  X  X ) of MC and the one derived via CLT ( X  X  clt  X  X ). Due to space limitations, we present the most representative results of performance of the effectiveness issue on Weibo data from Figure 9(e) to Figure 9(h) .
In Figure 8(j) and Figure 8(l) , we observe the approximation ra-tio of the Cost both in Normal and Zipf Distribution datasets. In-stead of a converging asymptotically, the approximation of Market Cost exhibits a linear tendency(i.e. 3  X  2  X  ). Further, we vary the given threshold  X  from 0.6 to 0.95, and the results of Cost its approximation are shown in Figure 9(a) and Figure 9(b) ,where the higher the threshold, the closer the approximation is. Note that in Figure 9(b) , the approximated cost becomes lower than the ex-act value(dashed line denoted as appx-2 ) when the given threshold is greater than 0.8. That is because the approximation only holds when the confidence of the given Wise Market satisfies the thresh-old(see Theorem 2). So, in Algorithm EMA , the approximation of Cost is only considered after its MC is validated.
The EMP problem is essentially with an O (2 N ) search space, so the proposed algorithm is actually an approximation algorithm. (a) Effectiveness of Cal. Cost(N) (e) Effectiveness of Cal. MC(B) (g) Effectiveness of Cal. Cost(B) With varying size from 100 to 800 and varying threshold  X  0.8 and 0.9, we present the Market Confidence and Cost of the selected Effective Market . Results are shown in Figure 9(c) and Figure 9(d) . It is interesting to observe that given a threshold, our algorithm could return a Wise Market with a proper MC . While the size of the given candidates set increases, the MC and of selected Wise Market do not increase obviously. However, the increased threshold  X  will cause a rise in Cost in order to include more investors with higher individual confidence. Moreover, the dotted line represents the performance with a baseline greedy al-gorithm, which enrolls workers according to their confidence until the threshold is satisfied. The result shows that for the same can-didate crowd, the market from our algorithm requests less market cost, which verifies our motivation for a Wise market.
 From Figure 9(e) to Figure 9(h) , we show the performance of EMP on real datasets. The results correspond to the complexity analysis in Section 5, where the approximation of MC and Cost behave satisfactory with increasing size. The difference of perfor-mance originates from different confidence estimation methods.
Crowdsourcing is the human computation [ 19] and social com-puting [ 11] powered with crowdsourced workforce. In the context of data management, crowdsourcing is primarily used in one of two ways: 1. As a new computing power, the crowds serve as  X  X  X PU X  X  that broadens the spectrum of processable data; 2. it introduces the entire social media/network as the data source instead of traditional formatted datasets. There are several leading prototype databases powered with crowdsourcing, e.g. sCoop [ 18], CrowdDB [ 9]and Qurk [14], as well as several specific operations based on these prototypes, e.g.Ranking [ 23], Join [13 ], Entity Matching [ 24], etc. Most of these systems and applications rely on a crowdsourcing platform like AMT as the workforce market. In addition, there are efforts to capture the wisdom of crowds from social media users, most notably in the context of opinions and reviews of popular products and travel (hotels and restaurants). Beyond these, social sensor networks are proposed to monitor earthquakes [ 21]andepi-demics [ 2]. Particularly, a visionary work [ 6] studies decision mak-ing tasks on micro-blog service with an idealized payment model.
Another related concept is the Prediction Market, which is be-lieved to be initially inspired by the financial markets X  capability of processing miscellaneous information. In the setting of such a market, even though investors intrinsically choose the option to maximize their rewards, the choice still reflects the investor X  X  real opinion between the two options (proven in [ 8]). As prototypes but also successfully running business, Iowa Electronic Market [3 ] and Intrade [ 4] are early examples of real-w orld prediction markets. Please also refer to [ 26] for a comprehensive survey of applications and models of the prediction market.

The quality of the answers from crowds is always a major con-cern for researchers in this area, and conducting  X  X  X orkers X  X  se-lection in an active manner is one of the best practices. Related works include Active Surveying [ 22, 25] which studies the opti-mal approach to issue social inquiries. Survey sampling is a well-developed science [ 20]. The primary concern is to get representa-tive samples from different demographic segments of the popula-tion, with an assumption of differences in opinion across segments. In our case, we are less interested in demographic differences --rather we are operating in a universe with a well-understood ground truth, which we just happen not to know and hence crowdsource to learn. Moreover, online review aggregation [ 17, 16] has been ex-tensively studied in the social media scenario these works typically aggregate all the inputs without any confidence or quality guaran-tee. Furthermore, the user contribution is driven by their own in-trinsic motivation, and hence hard to control.
 Discussion
Note that the crowd  X  X  X orkers X  X  here are normal social network/media users, who spend time on the service for pleasure and entertainment. Therefore, dissimilar to the commercial crowdsourcing platform like AMT, the existence of a potential payment is already an ef-fective arousal; besides, all the work of the users is simply making a binary choice to maximize their benefits, which also amazingly reflects their own judgement about the task (proven in [ 8]). As a comparison, the worker model in multi-agent systems (MAS) is de-signed to be more sophisticated with diverse functional attributes, which facilitates the study of logic and effectiveness of mutual co-operation. In summary, model-wise, our work provides task hold-ers an advanced  X  X  X rowd finder X  X  while MAS focuses more on the worker side; and problem-wise, our work tackles a special subset problem challenge, while the MAS aims at more sophisticated op-timization problems.

The limitation of this work is that we only focus on binary voting tasks, but it will not be substantially difficult to extend the setting to multiple choice problems. Moreover, this work is serving as a visionary effort in the research line of actively exploiting the power from online social users. Exciting future work includes more pow-erful and sophisticated tasks, where the quality of the crowds is measured differently according to the specific tasks.
In this paper, we define a new architecture for crowdsourcing using prediction markets defined over social media services. We define the Effective Market Problem( EMP ) as a means for task owners to get crowdsourced answers with the smallest expected cost while meeting a specified confidence threshold.

To calculate the market confidence, we present an exact algo-rithm with O ( n log 2 n ) time and a Central Limit Theorem-based approximation algorithm with O ( n ) time. To calculate the ex-pected market cost, an exact algorithm with O ( n log 2 n ) plexity is provided, and an approximation algorithm, which has the O ( n ) time complexity and the (3  X  2  X  ) approximation ratio, is pro-vided. An efficient algorithm for EMP by integrating the proposed algorithms. We have verified our proposed algorithms through ex-tensive empirical studies.

We believe that this is only the first paper to exploit this new architecture, restricted to binary questions with a simple majority vote as the aggregation method. We hope, in the future work, to be able to further expand the class of questions that can be addressed fruitfully with this architecture.
