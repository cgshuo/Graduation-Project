 1. Introduction
Submission of a patent application by inventors and innovators in a patent office is the first announcement about a new technique or technology. Publication of the patent claim by a patent office is the primary infor-mation available about a new technology. Patent information can be obtained from printed patent specifica-tions, from the bibliographical data in patent gazettes, and from more than hundred databases all over the world that are offered by various host organizations for online enquiries and data retrieval. The patent system fulfils two roles. It provides legal protection for novel products and processes and it ensures that the technol-ogy is available to all under certain conditions. Patents are unrivalled as rapid source of information about ongoing development of technologies. The number of patents per year and its growth or decline over time has been widely used as a technology indicator ( Griliches, 1990 ). Faust (1990) , however, observed that  X  X atent statistics are often distorted X  for various reasons  X  as he showed in case of Japan (due to  X  X xceedingly great number of domestic patent applications X ) and USA (due to  X  X elayed publications of patents X ). Yet such data (particularly long term data or statistics) can be extremely valuable for indicating past, present and future research and development (R&amp;D) trends.

In this paper we study growth of patents against research papers in superconductivity and rolling growth rates of patents and research papers separately for finding relation between development trends of knowledge (basic science) and technology. 2. Patents on superconductivity
Superconductivity was discovered in 1911. Immediately after, Kamerlingh Onnes in his Nobel lecture on 11th December 1913 referred to the possibility of constructing powerful electromagnets using superconductors ( Kamerlingh Onnes, 1967 ). For more than four decades no technology evolved because of the discouraging results regarding the fabrication of high field magnets out of the superconducting materials obtained. In early-1930s, de Haas and Voogd (1930), Mendelssohn (1933), and Keesom (1935) investigated the possibility of making use of lead X  X ismuth (Pb X  X i) alloy for the construction of superconducting coil magnets. The attempts failed due to low current-carrying capacity of the material used. Some interest of a practical nature evolved in the early-1950s. Yntema (1955) constructed the first successful superconducting electromagnet with niobium (Nb) wire. This flurry of activities brought into reality the potential nature of technological applica-bility of superconductivity. Applied or engineering superconductivity started only from early-1960s with the introduction of high field and high current superconductors using niobium X  X in (Nb 3 Sn) alloy by Kunzler, Buehler, Hsu, and Wernick (1961) . Indeed, filing and granting of patent applications on superconductivity started only in the mid-1950s.

The discovery of high temperature superconductivity (HTS) by Bednorz and Mu  X  ller (1986) opened up a new frontier of R&amp;D that is reflected in a new burst of publications of research papers and patents. The system of fast track acceptance of patent applications on HTS became a trend in some of the developed countries of the world. In early January 1987, Chu of University of Houston at Texas (USA) found that the yttrium X  barium X  X opper oxide (Y X  X a X  X u X  X ) compound system was superconducting at 93 K. He immediately applied for US patent on 12th January 1987 for the new compound and submitted a paper to Physical Review Letters after three weeks on 6th February 1987 ( Wu et al., 1987 ). This is probably one of the few cases when a scientist is applying for a patent for his new invention before submitting the same as a research paper. Chu chose this unconventional means to protect his research result and ensure priority. 3. Scientoinformetrics of patents on superconductivity
Faust (1990) analyzed data on 2613 patent applications on superconductivity for three years between 1985 and 1987 from database of the International Patent Documentation Center (INPADOC), Vienna. The obser-vation revealed that the patent data indicate technological advances before the actual beginning of an inno-vation. In the report of the National Superconductivity Programme of India (1998) , an analysis of data on 1900 patents on superconductivity was carried out  X  1200 patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) from 1975 to 1995 and 700 patents filed at the European Patent Office (EPO) from 1978 to 1995. The analysis revealed that patents granted by the USPTO from 1975 to 1987 were 14 on average (in ranges of 9 X 20) per year. With the advent of HTS the number of patents increased steadily from 25 in 1988 to 250 in 1995. On the other hand patent applications filed at EPO from 1978 to 1989 were 6 on average per year. In 1990, only 1 patent application was filed. There is a sudden jump to 110 patent applications in 1991. After that there has been continuous decline in number of patent applications till 1995. The report explained the decline by noting that the initial interest of R&amp;D on HTS was not sustained after a while.

Narin, Carpenter, and Woolf (1984) developed a series of technology indicators based on US patent cita-tion statistics. The main four indicators are Current Impact Index, Technological Strength, Science Linkage and Technology Cycle Time. Albert, Avery, Narin, and McAllister (1991) have empirically tested the first three indicators. Kayal (1997) and Kayal and Waters (1999) empirically evaluated the validity of the fourth indicator, i.e. the Technology Cycle Time (TCT), as a measure of the pace of technological progress in superconductor and semiconductor technologies. The study revealed that the trend in TCT changed abruptly from gradually increasing (slowing in cycle time) to steadily decreasing (speeding up in cycle time) following the discovery of HTS. The above four patent indicators developed for use upon a business house or company having R&amp;D, can well be applied and used for any R&amp;D organization, even probably for a country. 4. Growth of patents on superconductivity
Faust (1990) studied the levels of growth rate for patenting on superconductivity for the period from 1985 to 1987 for understanding early recognition of technological progress. This approach would have permitted identification of the technological progress free of influence of any other information. Kayal and Waters (1999) collected data of 3931 US patents related to superconductor technology between 1969 and 1994 from the USPTO; but for reasons of consistency, they used data of patents from 1974 to 1994. They compared the time series data for the number of patents granted per year with the TCT and found nonlinear relationship between them. Kayal (1997) studied the sensitivity of the TCT indicator in two major characteristics, which are low temperature (LTS) and high temperature (HTS) superconductor technologies and concluded that the pace of progress of HTS was faster than the LTS. The time range of his study of LTS was very short, only seven years from 1988 to 1994. But patents on LTS could be found from 1955 onwards. Besides these, there is no comprehensive growth data and study thereof on patents on superconductivity.

In this study, we have searched ESPACENET, the Europe X  X  network of patent databases (website: http:// gb.espacenet.com ) and collected data on patents on superconductivity for 46 years from 1955 to 2000. We have chosen this online database for two reasons. First, the database is comprehensive and exhaustive.
Second, it is easy to search and it is in the continuous process of updation. Our search has been made by using the keyword  X  X uperconductors X  through title and abstract (using Boolean sum: title or abstract) for each year separately from 1955 to 2000 ( Table 1 ). A total of 11173 patents on superconductivity were published all over the world from 1955 to 2000. It shows that there has been a steady growth in number of patents up to 1989. As already mentioned, we found that the first patent on superconductivity was published in 1955. But between 1956 and 1958 no patent was published. Till 1960, less than 10 patents could be found out. In the next decade till 1970, 223 patents were found. From 1971 to 1980, less than 400 patents were published. Between 1966 and 1975 there is a steady rate of publication with about 30 patents on average per annum. During the next five years (1981 X 1985) 396 patents, i.e. 80 patents on average per annum were published. In 1986 and 1987 there is a sudden jump to 130 and 149 patents, respectively. Then in 1988, 659 patents were published. But the highest jump occurred in 1989 with 2645 patents. Then, there is a fall in number of patents which continues till 2000 with exception in 1992. From 1990 to 2000 fall is almost stable.

In case of superconducting technology, it is observed that a burst in number of patents becomes evident immediately after a major breakthrough event of basic research. This is most probably due to the fact that at a certain point of time different groups and persons converge to some basic change in technological under-standing (resulting out of that basic research), so that an intensive technological R&amp;D activity or fabrication of instruments and devices starts to take place ( Table 1 ).

To review the growth pattern a five-yearly cumulation of superconductivity patents was made from 1951 X  1955 to 1996 X 2000 ( Table 2 ). The apparent values range from 1 to 4535. Then normal logarithms of the apparent values have been found out and they range from 0 to 3.657. These log values have then been put on Microsoft
Excel data sheet against five-year blocks from 1951 X 1955 to 1996 X 2000 ( Fig. 1 ). If the insignificant number of patents of first two blocks (i.e. 1 in 1951 X 1955 and 6 in 1956 X 1960) are ignored the five-yearly cumulation values for five blocks from 1961 X 1965 to 1981 X 1985 show an apparent steady and slow (linear) growth in number of patents ( Fig. 2 ). Extension of the regression line for these points passes by the point for 1996 X 2000. If a regression line including the point for 1996 X 2000 is drawn the over all semi-log linear pattern clearly indicates an exponen-tial growth in the form, P = 21.77  X  1.53 T (where P = number of patents, and T = time in block-years). The two raised points for 1986 X 1990 and 1991 X 1995 should be considered as special cases. They are apparent technolog-ical bursts on the basis of activities prompted by great hopes of HTS applications following Bednorz and Mu  X  ller paper in September 1986. The beginning of the stable exponential growth shown in our third five-year block (1961 X 1965) can be associated with the beginning of engineering superconductivity.

Between 1960 and 1962 a number of breakthrough discoveries took place, like superconductive tunneling by Giaever (1960) , type-II superconductivity exhibited by Nb 3 Sn system ( Kunzler et al., 1961 ) and Josephson effect ( Josephson, 1962 ). The practical field of superconducting magnets, large-scale applications of supercon-ductivity and devices of superconductive electronics grew out of these discoveries. Therefore, there was a burst in 1962. Discovery of HTS materials created serious technological ramifications and therefore there was a tre-mendous burst from 1987 onwards.
 5. Linkage between technology and basic science
The citations to the scientific literature from patents provide an indication of linkage between technology and basic science. The indicator science linkage (devised by Narin and associates, mentioned in Section 3 ) relates the number of citations per patent to research papers and other scientific publications. They have assumed that a higher value signifies leading edge technology with stronger links to basic science. Carpenter, Cooper, and Narin (1980) have used patent citation data to explore the degree to which scientific papers are cited in US patents. They have shown that a relatively high degree of citation of such papers reflects and iden-tifies the fields  X  electronics and biotechnology  X  with close links between technology and basic science. They have observed that while in electronics citation tends to be published in engineering science, in biotechnology they are published in basic science. The key point of these studies is to quantify the dependence of technology on basic science using patent citations. However, nobody considered the comparative growth (or decline) of research papers and patents of a particular field or sub-field for a sufficiently long period of time as trend indi-cator or linkage between technology and basic science as we have done here.

Growth curve of superconductivity patents was compared with the growth curve of research papers on superconductivity ( Fig. 1 ). The data of  X  X esearch papers X  on superconductivity have been collected from the Physics Abstracts . The semi-log (using normal logarithm) growth curve for research papers shows a nonlinear pattern with two cyclic components (slight convexity in each case). The first cycle is between block years 1956 X  1960 and 1981 X 1985. The second cycle is between 1981 X 1985 and 1996 X 2000. This means that the actual growth trend would be a two component exponential growth pattern. If we ignore the first two block years as nascent state of the first phase of applicability, then the patent growth is steady despite rise and fall of research papers in this period. In the second phase of applicability there is a mismatch between patterns of growth of basic research and technology. The basic research activities (shown by number of papers) followed a similar cycle pattern as in the former cycle (though with smaller cycle-life). But the technological activities (represented by number of patents) showed a short lived spurt, which declined to a normalcy (represented by the apparent growth line from pre-HTS era). The research papers in the field have been increasing quite stea-dily and stabilized from early 1990s. After 1995 patenting trend also stabilized more or less. It means patenting activity in the field is still modest and the initial interest of practical aspects of R&amp;D on HTS was not sustained after the middle of last decade of the twentieth century. One reason of this may be drying up of free funding for HTS technology after the initial vigorous competition among corporate houses and nations settled down. 6. Indicators to identify trend of technological development
We use the year-wise and five-yearly ratios of patents to research papers as trend indicators. The change in the ratio gives an indication of the trend of technological development over basic research in the field and vice-versa.

We suggest (heuristically and based on some nonrigorous observations) that the period for which patent-paper ratio is 0 may be called the gestation period for application (or technology) of the field or sub-field of research. If the ratio is 0 for the whole life of research activity of a field or sub-field, the field or sub-field should be termed as pure academic or  X  X nowledge oriented X  (e.g. a mathematical field or sub-field; an excep-tion though is  X  X uzzy X  mathematics). If the patent-paper ratio is less than 0.01 (&lt;0.01) then also we should con-we may term the field or sub-field as at the second level of potential applicability or of medium technological third level of applicability with high technological orientation. If the ratio is more than 0.5 (&gt;0.5) then we may term the field or sub-field as  X  X pplied X  and at the fourth level of applicability with strong technological orien-tation. So we devise a scheme ( Table 3 ) of considering technological orientation or tendency for applied research through these five levels of patent-paper ratio. The time period for passing from one level to the other would indicate the developmental stages of pure and applied nature of research.
 Our data show that stage of level 0 of applicability in superconductivity research is very high (45 years).
Period of first level of applicability is of 30 years, which is also very long. Only in the year 1989 the ratio went up beyond 0.5 but then fell again to 0.2 and remained as such for four years and then for the next two years the value was slightly more than 0.1. Afterwards the ratio went below 0.1. This shows that the field had potential for high technological orientation or applicability. Presumably due to lack of supportive technologies applied research did not flourish for a long time. Declining trend of the ratio also indicates that the field has not yet matured enough to exploit that potentiality. And knowledge oriented research activities still play a very vital role.

We use another indicator, which is a rolling ratio of growth for patents and research papers separately for each five-yearly block from 1951 X 1955 to 1996 X 2000 ( Table 4 ). This also shows more or less similar trends for research papers and patents. One can find large burst for patents on two occasions 1961 X 1965 and 1986 X 1990 periods with this indicator also ( Fig. 3 ). Research papers also show  X  X ursts X  in these periods but of much smal-ler values. Decline after 1990 is more significant in case of patents than for research papers. Comparison of semi-log curves for research papers and patents are also indicative of these ( Fig. 1 ). 7. Discussion
Almost every field or sub-field of physics or chemistry can be shown to have a symbiotic or mutualistic rela-tion between basic research (number of papers) and applied research or technological development (number of patents). For every field or sub-field, we can find a gestation period when there would be only papers but a very few or no patents. After that there would be a maturity period when patents start to grow and begin to be utilized. Patenting would be meaningless if there is a negative trend or lapse or inadequacy in general for using any development or innovation in practical (i.e. socio-technical) production and use. The gestation period would show the time span in which there would be papers but no patent. We can consider the time span in which the patenting trend stabilizes or goes on growing in proportion of papers. After that there would be a normal period of life span for the field. Number of papers would grow, stabilize and decline. Number of pat-ents would rise and fall. Ultimately the field would become  X  X old X  or  X  X ninteresting X  or  X  X ully developed X .
The case of superconductivity is probably unique. Even after about a century it has remained  X  X nteresting X  with unsolved problems and potentiality for development. The gestation period was very long  X  about 45 years. Its  X  X aturing X  or  X  X aturity X  period is also about 30 years. If the three  X  X ip X  points for 1956 X 1960, 1981 X 1985 and 1996 X 2000 in the apparent semi-log growth curve of papers are connected, they very nearly fall on a straight line with inclination 10.91 ( Fig. 4 ). This is almost parallel to the apparent smoothed up semi-log linear growth curve ( Fig. 2 ) connecting third to seventh and the tenth (last) block years for patents with inclination of 10.39 (already discussed in Section 4 ). This can be considered as  X  X nteresting X . This prob-ably indicates that after the first fifty years of  X  X nowledge oriented X  development, the  X  X tabilized X  or  X  X ettled X  or  X  X ore X  flow of basic research has become supportive to applied research and vice-versa.
 Choice of five-yearly blocks for the study was made heuristically. It has proved to be optimally functional. Blocks with more or less number of years were not as revealing as five-yearly blocks. First, third, seventh, eighth, tenth block periods are coincidental with significant event years.

There was a tendency among the scientific workers prior to the 1950s (end of the Second World War) not to take patent for anything and everything for which it was possible to get patent. No scientist working with superconducting materials (particularly alloys and compounds vis-a ` -vis type II) did take patents of the mate-rials for which they found superconductivity. Firstly, this was because of a general tendency to publish papers but not to patent. Secondly, the materials were simple and often already available. Thirdly, there was no  X  X se X  or  X  X arket demand X  of superconducting materials. But in HTS era all these three factors changed. Moreover (as has been noted in Section 2 ) patenting started to be considered as a quick and easy method for establishing priority (with possible monetary interest) and for more lasting imprint and more extensive impact. However, despite all these small noises, trend analysis in the main, done in this paper, may be taken as correct. References
