 Tagmantic.com is a web based so cial recommendation and search service which exploits the rich information within folksonomies. By developing multiple layers of organizational structure on top of folksonomies the relations be tween tags, users and resources can be utilized in order to crea te advanced recommender engines. The first layer of organizational structure is a tag graph which relates different entities within the folksonomy to each other. Its nodes are the concepts of the fo lksonomy presented by tags and the edges describe the relationships between these concepts. The second layer of organizational stru cture are tag clusters, which are build on top of the above mentioned tag graphs and represent the ontology of the underlying folksonomy. These Ontologies as well as the less complex tag graphs are utilized by the recommender algorithms within tagmantic in order to provide a unique and intuitive user experience of exploring and searching content in the internet. The methodology can be applied to different types of folksonomies which implies an enormous potential for future development of new recommender engines. H.3.5 [Web-based services], H.3.3 [Information filtering] General Terms: Algorithms Tag clusters group tags which are either semantically related to each other (e.g.  X  X redictive Modelling X  and  X  X orecasting X ) or synonymously used (e.g.  X  X BA X  and  X  X aster of Business Administration X ). They enable th e development of ontology based recommendation engines for arbitrary types of entities. The prerequisite to provide a recommender engine for any two types of objects is that each entity is projectable onto a tag cluster. For example for a recommender engine which includes the entity  X  X esource X  (e.g. an URL), a function which projects a resource r onto a tag cluster c is necessary: where is the set of tags that resource r has been annotated with and is the association-weight for the tag t towards cluster c.
