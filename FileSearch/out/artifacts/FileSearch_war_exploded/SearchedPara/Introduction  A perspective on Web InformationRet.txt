 Massimo Melucci  X  David Hawking Since the late nineteen-nineties Web Information Retrieval has attracted the attention of both researchers and commercial companies and has been fueled by theoretical results, methods, experiments, and implementations. The contributions published so far form a formidable knowledge base, even though the subject is rather young. However, many problems are still open and worthy of further research.

A call for papers was issued in November 2003 for this special issue on Web Infor-mation Retrieval. Forty-seven papers were received by the end of March 2004 and were each reviewed by three independent reviewers. The five best papers, i.e. Broder et al., Pla-chouras et al., Smyth and Balfe, Soricut and Brill and Tang et al. were selected for the special issue, thus providing a perspective on the subject and outlining the directions for the future.

Table 1 shows the coverage of the main topics provided by the papers selected for this issue X  X he central topics of each paper is highlighted with  X   X   X , whereas  X  +  X  highlights the other topics of the paper.

The five papers of this special issue report on diverse topics of Web Information Re-trieval from different yet complementary points of view. In this introduction, a summary of the main topics covered by the selected papers is presented. The reader may jump directly to the abstracts for more specific information about the content of individual papers.

Web user communities and behaviour are addressed in Smyth and Balfe and Tang et al.. The former paper leverages the search behaviour of communities of anonymous previous searchers thus combining information from the current user with information from the community, whereas the latter reports on a study of portal search engines in a health domain in which many of the searchers are health  X  X onsumers X .

Some functionalities for Web search are specifically studied in Smyth and Balfe, Soricut and Brill and Tang et al., although this topic is naturally inherent in all the five papers. In the first of these, the problem of vague queries is addressed by proposing a notion of collaborative search. Using context-sensitive and personalized search techniques, the selection patterns of previous searches are exploited to personalize the results of future searches. A more general type of question answering, which is becoming even more important in the context of Web search, is addressed in Soricut and Brill X  X nstead of concentrating on factoid questions, the authors propose a methodology to extract information to answer questions similar to those typical of a Frequently Asked Questions list. In Tang et al., a study on high quality search in the area of mental health compares general purpose and portal search engines for domain-restricted searches.

The sometimes ill-understood idea of topic distillation recognizes the fact that some relevant Web search results are of much greater utility to searchers than others. For example, the entry page to the BBC or CNN news site is likely to be much more useful to the searcher who types the query  X  X ews X  than would an arbitrary news report from the past. Bharat and
Henzinger (1998) defined topic distillation as a  X  X rocess of finding quality documents on a query topic X .

Topic distillation is addressed in Plachouras et al. and Tang et al., from two very different perspectives. The former reports extensive experiments aimed at devising optimal evidence combinations within the framework of the topic distillation task of the TREC Web Track. In the 2003 version of this task, quality documents are defined as entry pages of sites principally devoted to the topic, which are not subsites of higher level sites principally devoted to the topic.
The authors show that their proposed decision mechanism to devise the optimal combinations of evidence is useful in improving retrieval effectiveness. By contrast, Tang et al. take an evidence-based medicine perspective when defining quality within the domain of health information. General-purpose and domain specific engines are compared both on their ability to return relevant information and on the extent to which the returned documents provide advice which is in accord with best available evidence. An ideal health portal search engine would not return results which, while relevant to the query, provide dubious, misleading or harmful advice.

In the field of Web Information Retrieval, the issue of modeling has been faced by the researchers in two main ways X  X ne is the adaptation of retrieval models which proved to be effective in non-Web domains, the other is the definition of new models which exploit the availability of links. Paper Plachouras et al. exemplifies the first way X  X he authors performed the experiments using two probabilistic models, i.e. Robertson et al. X  X  Okapi model coupled with the BM25 weighing scheme, and Amati and van Rijsbergen X  X  Divergence From Ran-domness framework. Broder et al. X  X  paper is an example of the second way as it focusses on PageRank, a well-known link-based, query-independent ranking algorithm.
 Since the intention of PageRank is to distinguish higher quality or more popular pages, Broder et al. can be seen as falling under the heading of topic distillation. However, Broder et al. X  X  paper assumes the usefulness of PageRank and addresses only the question of effi-cient implementation. A methodology is proposed which aggregates the large page graph into a smaller host graph from which the PageRank distribution on the pages can be recon-structed. The reported experiments show that the time needed to recompute the PageRank is reduced considerably thus suggesting the possibility of implementing, for example, of efficient personalized PageRank algorithms.

In Smyth and Balfe, Soricut and Brill and Tang et al. prototype systems are introduced as proof-of concept tools or as information retrieval services on the Web. The issue of performance is addressed in all five papers: in Broder et al. more emphasis is put on efficiency than on effectiveness.
 The readers are invited to also read papers from other special issues devoted to Web Information Retrieval and mining which may be seen to complement this issue. In the Issue on Web-based Information Systems, (2002), the papers are a miscellanea of the various aspects of Web Information Access: algorithms, interfaces, architectures. Aspects of Information Retrieval are introduced in all papers at different levels of depth. In Kohavi et al. (2002), the papers are revised and extended versions of the ones presented at the 2000 WebKDD work-shop held in conjunction with the ACM conference on Knowledge Discovery in Databases. There are good contributions on the use of mining algorithms for e-commerce solutions. Web ometrics is an interesting area of research addressed in Thelwall and Vaughn (2004). The pa-pers address Web domain size, the inter-relationships between domains, the characteristics of end users, and the influence or standing of sites. In Chen (2003), six papers  X  X eport research in web retrieval and mining. Most papers apply or adapt various pre-web retrieval and analysis techniques to other interesting and challenging web-based applications. X  Finally, the papers in Spink (2002) describe studies of different sizes reporting on diverse aspects of Web search. References
