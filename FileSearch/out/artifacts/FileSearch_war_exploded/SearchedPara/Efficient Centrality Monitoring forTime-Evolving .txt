 Yasuhiro Fujiwara 1 , Makoto Onizuka 1 , and Masaru Kitsuregawa In graph theory, the facility location problem is quite important since it involves finding good locations for one or more facilities in a given environment. Solving this problem starts by finding the nodes whose distances to other nodes is the shortest in the graph, since the cost it takes to reach all other nodes from these nodes is expected to be low. In graph analysis, the centralities based on this concept are closeness . In this paper, the closeness centrality of node u , C defined as the sum of distances from the node to other nodes.

The naive approach, the exact computation of centrality, is impractical; it needs distances of all node pairs. This led to the introduction of approximate approaches, such as the annotation approach [13] and the embedding approach [12,11], to estimate centralities. These approaches have the advantage of speed at the expense of exactness. However, approximate algorithms are not adopted by many practitioners. This is because the optimality of the solution is not guaranteed; it is hard for approximate algorithms to identify the lowest centrality node exactly. Furthermore, the focus of traditional graph theory has been limited to just  X  X tatic X  graphs; the implicit assumption is that nodes and edges never
