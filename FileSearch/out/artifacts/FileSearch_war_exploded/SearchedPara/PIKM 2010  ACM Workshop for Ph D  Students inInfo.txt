 The PIKM workshop focuses on papers consisting mainly of the Ph.D. dissertation proposals of doctoral students. A wide range of topics on any area in databases, information retrieval and knowledge management are presented at this workshop. The areas of interest are similar to those at the CIKM main conference in the three respective tracks. Inter-disciplinary work across these tracks is encouraged. H.2.0 [ Information Systems ]: Database Management; H.2.8 [ Information Systems ]: Database Management X  Database Applications [Data Mining]; H.3.3 [ Information Systems ]: Information Storage and Retrieval X  Information Search and Retrieval Algorithms,Design,Experimentation,Performance,Theory CIKM, PIKM, doctoral consortium, Ph.D. forum, disser-tation problems. database systems, information retrieval, knowledge management, interdisciplinary work
The PIKM workshop has a fairly broad scope. The goal of this workshop is to motivate Ph.D. students to present their dissertation research at a relatively early stage. The targeted students are those with a focus in one or more of the CIKM research tracks, i.e., databases, information retrieval and knowledge management. This workshop enables them to present their Ph.D. dissertation proposals and/or ongoing research on their dissertation sub-problems. It gives them an opportunity to get feedback on their early work from researchers worldwide.
 It is noticed that a broad range of topics are addressed in CIKM related to various issues in databases and information and industry such as students, faculty, researchers and cor-porate professionals who would be interested in the early work of Ph.D. students.
Keynote Speaker : Professor Ren  X ee J. Miller from the Uni-versity of Toronto, Canada, is the keynote speaker at PIKM 2010. The workshop will be opened with the keynote talk, which will be beneficial to all the attendees.
 Best Paper Award : Based on the reviews conducted by the PC members, the award for the best paper in PIKM goes to Juan Amiguet, Andreas Wombacher and Tim Klifman for their paper Annotations: Dynamic Semantics in Stream Processing [4].

Review Article : A review article summarizing the pro-ceedings of PIKM 2010 will be authored by its co-chairs and submitted to a suitable ACM venue such as SIGMOD Record . Such articles were published in SIGIR Forum and SIGKDD Explorations based on the papers presented at the PIKM 2007 [22] and PIKM 2008 [20] workshops respectively.
Journal Issue : A special issue of the International Journal on Knowledge and Web Intelligence (IJKWI) will be dedi-cated to the expanded versions of selected papers presented at PIKM 2010. These papers will be expected to describe work at a more advanced stage of the doctoral research, e.g., one complete sub-problem. There will be a guest editorial board for this purpose and the expanded papers submitted to this journal will go through a formal double blind review process. This will ensure the selection of the top high quality papers to be included for publication in the issue.
