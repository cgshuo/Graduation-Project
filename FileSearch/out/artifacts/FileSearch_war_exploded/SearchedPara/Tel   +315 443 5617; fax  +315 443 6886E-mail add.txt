 John Battelle, The search: How Google and its rivals rewrote the rules of business and transformed our culture, Penguin Group, 311 pp., ISBN: 1-59184-088-0, Cost: $25.95
The following three quotations summarize the major points of the book.
Therefore, I will organize the review around these three statements. When I first read this statement, I recalled Michael Lesk X  X  statement in Digital Libraries: Books, Bytes, and
Bucks (Lesk, 1997) that textual search as a problem is nearly solved [p. 2]. It highlights, for me, (1) the dis-connect that so often exists between academics and practitioners and (2) how difficult it is to predict where a field or technology is going. Lesk X  X  comment comes before the massive increase of content on Web, the reli-ance on Web search engines in everyday information seeking, the increase in Web spam content to deceive search engines, and the growth of paid search as a business model for online commerce.

Battelle does a good job of supporting Manabar X  X  position by outlining various issues including technical, social, linguistically, and commercial that Web search faces today. Surprisingly to me, some of the technical issues were the most interesting. For example, the author comments that Google has more computers (approxi-mately, 175,000) servicing its search index than existed in the entire world in the 70s. Battelle touches on issues familiar to most researchers in the field, including the effect of stop words, term matching, and meta-data, along with some more uncommon ones including paid search and spam.
In the social area, Battelle uses a  X  X  X atabase of Intentions X  X  metaphor to describe the possible uses of and knowledge from the massive amount of search data that Google, Yahoo!, and the other major search engines have concerning the desires, issues, and interests of millions of searchers. He addresses the implicit trust be-tween searchers and search engines and the increasing strain that exists (or will exist) between this  X  X  X mplicit trust X  X  and the pressures from government and others to use this information for a variety of purposes, espe-cially national security. The author does an excellent job of highlighting the simultaneous and ongoing changes in technology, information and people that has brought us to the point where this is a concern. In fact, the databases are already being used for purposes other than improving search (c.f., Ettredge, Gerdes, &amp; Karuga, 2005; Jansen, Jansen, &amp; Spink, 2005).

The tension between protecting this  X  X  X mplicit trust X  X  of searchers and utilizing the information contained within for other purposes raises many concerns and difficult situations. There may not be a right answer for all situations. For example, take national security. Certainly, it seems reasonable that one expects a degree of privacy when using a search engine. However, I then picture in my mind the image from 9/11, of the Towers coming down. If there is information contained within the search engine databases that could save lives, shouldn X  X  one use it to save those lives? You cannot get much more  X  X  X on X  X  be evil X  X  than that.
Perhaps technology will provide a  X  X  X appy middle ground X  X . As an analogy, most organizations have por-nography detection software that is reasonably non-intrusive running on their networks due to sexual harass-ment, illicit use of equipment, and productivity concerns. Why not some  X  X  X errorist detection software X  X  for these search engine databases using a similar approach? Whatever the answer, this is tough situation that society is going to have to address soon, as the author states.
The discussion here is one that researchers in the field will be very familiar with, namely  X  X  X ow to get the retrieval engine to  X  X now X  what you are looking for? X  X  The book both sets the stage with Web search in this area and paints the step-by-step picture of technical and paradigm advances that are getting us to this goal.

Along the way, it may be difficult to tell which technological innovations will actually be beneficial. In a confirmation of what I had heard anecdotally, Brin and Page recount how their research paper on the link ranking feature now known as PageRank was rejected by the SIGIR conference as  X  X  X isjointed X  X  and  X  X  X ot
IR X  X  enough. (It would be interesting to find out who the reviewers were!) In hindsight, one can make a good case that the implementation of Web linking with anchor text was one of the major advances in Web search.
Brin and Page X  X  subsequent paper describing this work (Brin &amp; Page, 1998) has become one of the most cited papers in information retrieval. For those interested, see CiteSeer, ISI Web of Science, and Google
Scholar for the citation counts. So, for the legions of researchers who have had papers rejected from SIGIR, take heart!
These are the three major themes of the book, but there are many other interesting aspects also. One cap-tivating idea presented in the book is  X  X  X earch X  X  as an interface metaphor, which makes good sense given that the browser was designed to display Web results and is the de facto standard for application interfaces today.
In addition, there are interesting correlations presented in the book on how search is influencing our commu-nication and term usage patterns. I found it a very interesting and provoking line of reasoning.
The book is 311 pages, which includes an 11 page index and 11 pages of notes. The main part of the book is divided into 11 chapters (what is with the 11 thing?), plus an epilogue and acknowledgements sections (only 8 pages total, not 11). The first two chapters are an overview of the issues and influences of Web search. Chapter 3 is a review of pre-Google search on the Web X  X es, it existed. Chapters 4 X 11 trace Web search as Google develops as an organization, a technology, and a Web brand.

Overall, the book is very well organized and informative. The author does a good job of not making the book  X  X  X ust about Google X  X ; rather, the author places Google within the progression of Web search. There is ample discussion of many of the other  X  X  X re-now X  X  search engines, such as AltaVista, Lycos, and Excite. The book discusses Yahoo! and acknowledges Yahoo! as a major Web force, but the author seems to put Yahoo! in this  X  X  X istant place X  X  for most of the book. I found this interesting.
 During the seemly endless string of  X  X  X ot new search engines X  X  X  X ycos, Hotbot, Excite, NorthernLight,
Infoseek, AlltheWeb.com, AltaVista, plus maybe a dozen other ones X  X hat have come and gone, Yahoo! has watched the competition come and go, serves relevant results as good as any other engine in the field (c.f., Jansen &amp; Molina, 2006), has always been a major player, and is still a major player today. Now, that is the interesting story of Web search! How has Yahoo! done it for so long when so many others have failed?
There are several inline references to both private Web research companies X  studies and academic articles, although these are weighted to the articles from search engine researchers and not university academics. I found the 89 endnotes in the notes section especially interesting. These endnotes added a lot of value to the book. The ample combination of both references and endnotes provide an additional degree of legitimacy many times not seen in popular press books.

The book reads as the author X  X  journey through this investigation. One feels the author X  X  presence through-out the book. There are a handful of  X  X  Hey, look at me! Ain I great?  X  X  comments. However, the statements are never over the top. So, I found these occasional remarks more humorous than irritating, thus, they added to the pleasurable read rather than distracting from it.
I enjoyed the book. Web search is my research area, so I expected the book to be just a confirmation of what I already knew. However, I learned a lot! It is a must read for any researcher or practitioner of Web information searching or information retrieval.
