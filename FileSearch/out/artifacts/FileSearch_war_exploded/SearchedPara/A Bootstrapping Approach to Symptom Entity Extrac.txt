 An electronic medical record(EMR) is the medical information of patient s accessed and modified in a named entities in EMR[2]: disease, symptom, test and treatment. Among them, symptom entities have the most abundant and flexible knowledge about the physical cond ition of the patient, and are the writing of medical staffs.[3 -5] Chinese EMR. In the specification, symptom refers to the discomfort caused by a disease or abnormal performance and explicit abnormal test results [ 6 ]. Its corresponding UMLS semantic types include sign s or symptom s , mental or behavior al dysfunc tion and abnormal test results. A typical symptom is composed of some subjects, a lesion and some modifiers. Symptoms always occur in a certain body part , behaviors or states of patient s which are called the subject in this paper . P athological changes or while others cannot be separated from subjects. Besides the subject and lesion, and other information in a symptom entity such as severity, frequency and s o on , are called modifier s . [8] knowledge base. However, symptom entities are strongly patternized in Chinese EMRs. Patterniz ation of symptom entities is reflecte d in the following aspects: Most symptom entities consist of one subject, one lesion and modifiers of them. Subject, lesion and modifiers are fixed types of word s . For example, and  X   X  X  X   X  (  X  sleep  X  ), lesions are words describing abnormalities like  X   X  X  X   X  (  X  pain  X  ),  X   X  lesion. Our method utilizes patternized information of s ymptom entities in the process of extract ion . EMRs. On the basis of medical named entity annotating specification s , our method focus es on locating lesions and the ir corresponding subjects. Instead of extracting continuous strings as symptom entities, seed tuples in large unannotated Chinese EMRs. To realize the co nfidence measure of candidate tuples in the process of bootstrapping, we designed a soft pattern with the modifiers information of &lt;subject, corpus according to the specification.
 updating, candidate entity extr acting and confidence measure are described in section 3. The r esult s of the experiments are show n in section 4 includ ing the performance of our system with different parameter s and also contrast ing it against experiments of other researchers. Section 5 gi ves the conclusion of this paper and discuss es future work. named entity extraction on EMR are based on rule and dictionary, or supervised machine learning. In the concept extraction task of the 2010 i2b2/VA challenge, unannotated text of patient reports were given for systems to identify and extract the text corresponding to patient s medical problems, treatments and tests[ 9 ]. Savova G et.al [ 10 ] built a NLP system for information extraction from EMRs by trained clinical domain dictionary on CTAKES. Feng Y, Li D, Jiang M et.al[ 11 -13 ] proposed supervised machine learning methods for clinical named entity extracting. Some researchers choose semi -supervised machine learning methods rather than supervised machine learning methods. Jonnalagadda [ 14 ] et al. use d a semi -supervised s equential discriminative classifier (Conditional Random Fields) to extract the mentions of medical problems, treatments and tests from clinical part -of -speech tags, their method also used as a feature words that that appear in similar contexts to the The F -value of this method was 0.823. De Bruijn[ 15 ] et al. realize d concept taggin g by a discriminative Semi -Markov model. Semi -Markov models are Hidden Markov Models that tag multi -token spans of needed. Concept mapping features include context features and word -level features extracted from cTAKES and UMLS output. Their method reached a n F -value of 0.8523, which was the best in the concept extraction task of the i2b2 2010 challenge. method propose d a definition of two -tuples &lt;target, description&gt; for medical information. With a series of algorithms including pattern generalization, pattern automatic extraction and medical information similar two -tuple definition in symptom entity extracting and introduce s soft pattern and fuzzy matching from Zhao J  X  s inspiration. Their method[1 7 ] offers a solution to generating a soft pattern. It generate s pattern examples through segmenting sentences by event examples and filter s them by notion words, stop words and trigger words. The main idea of our method is that we can iteratively extract two -tuples of &lt;target, description&gt; from only a few annotated tuples by bootstrapping, and form symptom entities by extracted tuples. Bootstrapping is a simple and intuitional method which is widely used in natural language processing. [18] Two main difficulties of the bootstrapping method are: (1) Effectiveness of bootstrapping is directly affected by the precision and covering ability of the initial seed set. (2) Errors occur in the self -training process which will be magnified during iteration. For the first difficult y, we invite trained medical staffs to accomplish the annotating task. Since Chinese EMRs from various departments have common linguistic features, we are able to guarantee the quality of seed set. For the second difficulty, a soft pattern provides us a so lution for the measuring confidence of a candidate X  X  two -tuples. We calculate the similarity between word frequency vectors in the slots of the soft pattern s and word frequency vectors of &lt;subject, lesion&gt;  X  s context information. In each iteration we add sy mptom entities with the highest confidence value and adjust the soft pattern according to the context information of the newly added entities.
 challenge but focus es on symptom information. G iven Chinese EMRs from several departments, we locate d the border of two parts: subject and lesion. Examples of two -tuples extraction are described as follow: limbs&lt;/subject&gt; &lt;lesion&gt;fracture&lt;/lesion&gt;&lt;/symptom&gt;  X  ) pathological murmurs.  X  ) &lt;/lesion&gt;&lt;/symptom&gt; (  X  Heart valve areas found no &lt;symptom&gt;pathological &lt;lesion&gt;murmurs&lt;/lesion&gt;&lt;/symptom&gt;.  X  ) (  X  &lt;symptom&gt; Intermittent &lt;lesion&gt; dizziness &lt;/lesion&gt;&lt;/symptom&gt;  X  ) to one lesion and we annotate the whole sentence as a symptom entity. Subje ct and lesion are separated by negative words and modifiers in source example 3, so we only annotate lesion as the symptom entity. And  X  dizziness  X  of source example 4 can  X  t be segmented in Chinese. provided by the record s room from t he s econd a ffiliated h ospital of Harbin Medical University (HMUSAH) . Original medical records are paper records so we use d OCR(Optional Character Recognition) to convert them into EMRs. 3.1 D efinition of symptom entity and soft pattern Subject and lesion are two main parts of symptom entities. In this paper we define lesion as a description of performance of physical abnormalities, and the subject as body parts or subjects where the lesion occ urs . Subject and lesion are both single word s which have direct semantic association with each other. For example, in the sentence  X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X  (  X  Neck  X  s activity limited  X  ), subject of  X   X  &lt;subject,lesion&gt; which contain information of the symptom entity to locate them in large unannotated EMRs. choos ing the candidate entities by POS information, then use s fuzzy matching with soft pattern to extracted tuples according to the annotating specification. The f low chart of bootstrapping is shown in Figure 1.
 method use s fuzzy matching instead of hard matching. In order to realize the fuzzy matching, we set up pattern by context infor mation of the seed entities and update it in each iteration. Confidence value s of candidate tuples are measured by the matching degree with the soft pattern. 3.2 Initializ ation of the candidate set and soft pattern the symptom entities. For extracting the candidate two -tuples, we traverse segmented and unannotated corpus es sentence by sentence since symptom entity and its related context features are distributed Every noun can be extracted as a subject, forming a tuple with all nouns/verbs/adjectives behind it as lesions. Specially, for sentences which have no nouns, we only extract candidate lesions and the subject remains empty.
 of subject and lesion:  X  &gt;(  X  &lt;lung, rale&gt;  X  ) in a seed set and we find the sentence  X   X   X   X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X  (  X  Both lungs heard no obvious rale.  X  ) containing it. Then we save the information o f the sentence in three slots: {  X  },{  X  ,  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  }{null} ({  X  Both  X  },{  X  heard no obvious  X  },{null}). And these three slots become the basic form of our soft pattern: tuples and form three slot vectors. SlotL and slotM are considered as modifiers of a subject while slotM words in front of the corresponding sentence into slotM because only slotM stores modifiers of the lesion. The f eature vector for each candidate tuple is formed in the same way with the slot vectors of a soft pattern. 3.3 Candidate entity  X  s confidence measure Mo st standard bootstrapping methods have to measure the confidence of both the entities and patterns, but our method update s the soft pattern by the confirmed two -tuples instead of measur ing its confidence. Based on the generalized soft pattern and slot vect ors containing standard information of modifiers, we are able to transform a candidate tuple evaluation problem to a word vector similarity calculating problem in which vectors have more common terms obtain a higher similarity value. The m atching degree fo r tuples can also be represented as a cosine similarity value between feature vectors of candidate tuples and standard vectors in the slots of the soft pattern. The c osine similarity between two vectors x and y is: corresponding standard vector in the slots of the soft pattern are calculated, respect ively . In addition, we combine Left_Gram and Middle_Gram as modifiers for the subject, and Middle_Gram and Right_Gram as modifiers for lesion . The standard vectors in the soft pattern are also combined in this same way. Thus, we calculate five similarity v alues show n in following table: tuples(N is a presupposed constant) with the highest similarity value is update d for the seed tuple set. rules for annotating symptom entities: 1) If a symptom and its body part or subject are directly parts or subjects. 2) If the sympto m and its body part or subject are inseparable, we annotate them as one symptom entity. 3) If the symptom and its body part are separated by punctuations , negative words or modifiers, only the symptom is annotate d.
 symptom entity annotation by processing the seed tuple and the soft pattern in the iteration. divided by negative words or punctuations . 4) Lesion has no corr esponding subject. In order to comply with annotating specification s , we annotate subjects, lesion and their modifiers as symptom entities in case 1) and 2), and then annotate lesion and its modifiers in case 3) and 4).
 According to the four forms of symptom entities in Chinese EMRs, symptom entity annotating based on our bootstrapping method appl ies the following rules: part of the symptom entity. If th e frequency of one word in slotL cannot reach the threshold, we ignore word in slotR. Specially, if the frequency of one word in slotM cannot reach the threshold, we ignore the whole sentence because the border of a symptom entity cannot be determined. 4.1 Source data and security measures In this section we represent the experiments for symptom entity extracting using the bootstrapping method. We randomly select 992 sets of Chinese EMRs whose privacy information was removed. of the Harbin Medical University (HMUSAH) , and their confiden tiality and security are ensured by the regulations of the hospital. We intercept admission condition, discharging condition from discharge records, and disease cases from progress notes.

We have demons trated a bootstrapping symptom entity extracting method suitable for unannotated and design ed a soft pattern to locate them in sentences in EMR.

Experiments on Chinese electronic medical records show that our approach have reached an acceptable F value.
