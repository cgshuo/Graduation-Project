The conference was held during December 2  X  4, 2015, at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, Australia.
 The annual AIRS conference is the main information retrieval forum for the Asia-Paci fi c region and aims to bring together academic and industry researchers, along with developers, interested in sharing new ideas and the latest achievements in the broad area of information retrieval. AIRS 2015 enjoyed contributions spanning the theory and application of information retrieval, both in text and multimedia.
This year we received 92 submissions form all over the world. Submissions were peer reviewed in a double-blind process by at least three international experts, with at least one senior meta-reviewer. The fi nal program of AIRS 2015 featured 29 full papers (32 %) divided in 10 tracks:  X  Ef fi ciency,  X  X  Graphs, Knowledge Bases and Tax-onomies,  X  X  Recommendation,  X  X  Twitter and Social Media,  X  X  Processing, Understanding, and Categorization,  X  X  Topics and Models,  X 
Evaluation,  X  and  X  Social Media and Recommendation.  X  The program also featured eight short papers and three demonstrations (12 %).

AIRS 2015 featured two keynotes: the fi rst by Peter Bruza (Queensland University of Technology), titled  X  Quantum Haystacks Revisited,  X  and the second by Peter Bailey (Microsoft Research), titled  X  The Great Search Bake Off.
The conference and program chairs of AIRS 2015 extend our sincere gratitude to all authors and contributors to this year  X  s conference. We are also grateful to the Program Committee for the great reviewing effort that guaranteed AIRS 2015 could feature a quality program of original and innovative research in information retrieval.

In this talk he put forward the idea that quantum theory could inspire a  X  design language for Information Retrieval this design language relies on quantum logic and quantum probabilities, rather than the classical probabilities that underpin much of Information Retrieval theory. The aim of this talk is to revisit quantum haystacks. It will put forward the idea that quantum theory can inspire a  X  design language for the Information Retrieval user on developments in the emerging fi eld of quantum cognition, theory and empirical evidence will be provided that quantum probabilities more naturally express human conceptual processing and decision making. As both of these pertain to the information seeking user, implications for the development of formal Information Retrieval user models will be presented.
 A major access divide has opened up between the academic and commercial Web search communities over the last 10  X  15 years due to the availability and importance of large scale search log user data in understanding certain types of search behavior. At the same time, the success and simplicity of Cran fi eld-inspired Information Retrieval test collection experimentation methods has encouraged our research publication community to chase marginal gains of the latest effectiveness metric. However, experimentation based on test collections remains fundamentally essential in carrying out cost-effective development of search system algorithms. The real challenge and opportunity for all IR researchers, be they academic or industrial, is to improve the external validity of our experimental outcomes. The users of search systems, and their unfailing and surprising variability, have too often been overlooked when developing test collections. Based on a range of research that sits at the intersection of academic and industrial investigations, I hope to persuade you of the centrality of users in search evaluation, and the opportunities to integrate them more within our familiar experi-mental frameworks.

The conference was held from November 30 to December 2, 2016, at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. The annual AIRS conference is the main information retrieval forum for the Asia-Paci fi c region and aims to bring together academic and industry researchers, along with developers, interested in sharing new ideas and the latest achievements in the broad area of information retrieval. AIRS 2016 enjoyed contributions spanning the theory and application of information retrieval, both in text and multimedia.

This year we received 74 submissions form all over the world, among which 57 were full-paper submissions. Submissions were peer reviewed in a double-blind pro-cess by at least three international experts and one session chair. The AIRS 2016 featured 21 full papers divided into seven tracks: Data Mining for IR,  X  X  IR Models and Theories  X  (two tracks), User Modeling,  X  X  Personalization and Recommendation  X  (two tracks) and uation.  X  The program also featured 11 short or demonstration papers.

AIRS 2016 featured three keynote speeches:  X  New Ways of Thinking About Search with New Devices  X  from Emine Yilmaz (University College London); Answering Become the Main Theme of IR Research?  X  from Hang Li (Huawei Noah Ark Lab); and  X  NLP for Microblog Summarization  X  from Kam-Fai Wong (The Chi-nese University of Hong Kong).

The conference and program chairs of AIRS 2016 extend our sincere gratitude to all authors and contributors to this year  X  s conference. We are also grateful to the Program Committee for the great reviewing effort that guaranteed AIRS 2016 could feature a quality program of original and innovative research in information retrieval. Special thanks go to our sponsors for their generosity: GridSum Incorporation, Sogou.com Incorporation, Alibaba Group, and Airbnb. We also thank Springer for supporting the best paper award of AIRS 2016 and the Special Interest Group in Information Retrieval (SIGIR) for supporting AIRS by granting it in-cooperation status and sponsoring the student travel grant.
