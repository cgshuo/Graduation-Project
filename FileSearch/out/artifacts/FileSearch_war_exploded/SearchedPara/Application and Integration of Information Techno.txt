 The conception of Informatization comes of Japan in 1960s. The conception of  X  X n-formation society X  and  X  X nformatization X  used in west society at large begin in 1970s.The cognition of  X  X nformatization X  is very different in different country, but the cognition of  X  X nformation society X  is common: in information society the information not only raises productivity but also has effect solving society problem and extending mankind activity domain. In our country, the definition about informatization is: the informatization is historical process to breed and develop new productivity delegated by intelligentize tools and benefit society. 
Our country is a developing country. The process of industrialization has not accom-plished. Impelled by global informatization, our government work out tactic that infor-matization drives industrialization. This incarnates plenty informatization X  X  important status and action in our country development. The cognition of informatization advance and advance, include all levels governments, all departments of national economy, all enterprises. The country constitutes corresponding informatization examining guideline too. To quantificational examines informatization development level of every region. 
The Water Resources informatization is hi storical process to breed and develop new productivity delegated by intelligentize tools and advance benefit of the Water Resources industry. In other words, first, the key of the Water Resources informatiza-the Water Resources technology and digital degree of the Water Resources admini-stration full making use of the most advanced technology (chief information tech-nology); next, the purpose of the Water Resources informatization is to full heighten technology level and administration efficiency, thereby to heighten the whole benefit of the Water Resources industry; third, the Water Resources informatization is a part of whole history process of society informatization. 
The chiefly task of the Water Resources informatization is widely to apply infor-mation technology in the Water Resources operations, to construct foundation estab-lishment of the Water Resources information systems, adequately to dig underlying knowledge of information resources, to heighten the whole level of the flood preven-tion control, the water resources optimize control, the water project scrutiny control and the water administration using it, to accelerate modernization of the Water Re-sources operation. According informatization development rule the realization of the Water Resources informatization divides into three phases. They are the preliminary informatization phase, the basal informatization phase and the full informatization phase. The first phase primarily solves problem of data gather and share, to achieve target that the information systems can provide any data what need at the water resources works; the second phase primarily make data to useful information, can answer specific question quizzed by applications, namely provides in formation of appointed subject to applica-tions; third phase primarily abstracts knowledge from information, provides doable solving scheme supported by decision supporting technology and so on. Correspond-ing three phases, the system general architecture of the Water Resources informatiza-tion constitutes of three layers. They are the data underlay layer, the information ser-vice layer and the decision-supporting layer. Every layer finishes itself task and pro-vides service for upper layer. The object dealt by the data underlay layer is data. The object dealt by the information service layer is information. The object dealt by the decision-supporting layer is knowledge. The data underlay layer is foundation of system, the information service layer is key of system, the decision-supporting layer is core of system. The system general architecture is shown in Figure 1. 
In the data underlay layer, the pivotal technology are data gather technology, data transfers technology, data storage technology and OLTP technology, emphases is building foundation data circumstance. The aim is to make data the most abundance, to realize data share.  X  X igital X  is primary sign of this layer. 
In the information service layer, the pivotal technology are data conformity tech-nology, data assimilation technology and OLAP(for example data warehouse, spatial data, visualization, etc), emphases is building information service platform. The aim is make information sufficient conformity, to realize information service.  X  X nformati-zation X  is primary sign of this layer. 
In the decision-supporting layer, the pivotal technology are knowledge discovery technology, AI technology, expert system, etc, emphases is building DSS. The aim is make knowledge high proficiency, to realize decision-supporting service.  X  X nowl-edgization X  is primary sign of this layer. 3.1 The Technology Referred by the Data Underlay Layer The pivotal technologies have 3S technology, communications and computer network technology, database technology, online transaction processing technology, etc re-ferred by the data underlay layer. They finish gather, transfers and storage of data. 3S Technology: is an organic whole consisting of GPS, RS and GIS. It is an important supporting technology to obtain, store and manage, renew, analyze and apply spatial data. It is one of pivotal technology of digital because the most of data referred by the water resources information are spatial data concerned with geography position. Communications and Computer Network Technology: is an important foundation of the Water Resources informatization. It is a foundation guaranteeing betimes and exactitude of transfers for the water resources information. Database Technology: is a primary technology of data storage now, and an important data storage technology at very long time what can be foresee. The choice of ad-vanced database system is very pivotal for the Water Resources informatization be-cause the database system is one of important pledge of high capability and efficiency of whole water resources informatization system. Online Transaction Processing Technology: is the transaction processing driven user. It is primary used of maintain a lot of data and find data simply in the water resources informatization system. That ensures integrality and coherence of data through OLTP. 3.2 The Technology Referred by the Information Service Layer The pivotal technologies have online analytical processing technology, data ware-house technology, distributed spatial database technology, etc referred by the infor-mation service layer. They provide information service facing subject and polishing. Online Analytical Processing Technology: is fast analysis of share multi-dimension information based on actual application and use demand of OLAP product. OLAP can do all kinds of fast analysis for massive data from different point of view and different lay, provide decision gist for the water resources high-layer decision-maker. Data Warehouse Technology: is data aggregate, it supports decision-analysis proc-essing of enterprise or organization, faces subject, is integration, is not renewed, changes uninterrupted along with time. The data warehouse provides good data foun-dation to the Water Resources informatization. To designed a great deal of data ware-house according to subject and different request of the water resources application calling data, integrate data of different period and sort, and provide correlative appli-cation systems calling. This can raise efficiency that application systems call data, and makes going along complicated data analysis research possibility. Spatial Database Technology: is used to storage the spatial database. The spatial spatial entity. The spatial data not only can figure information of spatial position and relation. Most of the water resources data are data correlating with spatial position. It can get twice the result with half the effort using distributed spatial database technol-ogy administer and process the water resources data. 3.3 The Technology Referred by the Decision-Supporting Layer The pivotal technologies have data mining and knowledge discovery technology, artificial intelligence and expert system technology, decision supporting system tech-nology, etc. They provide intelligentized decision service. Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Technology: data mining is distilling inter-ested knowledge from a lot of data. The knowledge is connotative prior unknown latency useful information. The knowledge distilled may express form of concepts, rules, regularities, patterns, etc. Using da ta mining technology to discovery useful knowledge from the water resources data can help advancing decision level. Artificial Intelligence and Expert System Technology: artificial intelligence simu-lates intelligent behavior of human brain using computer. The export system simulates thinking process of human export solving problem to resolve all kind of problems inside main of the water resources. AI will provide help for solving these problems. Decision Supporting System Technology: is human-machine system supporting deci-sion activity and have intelligence function based on administration science, operational research, cybernetics and behavior science means of computer technology, emulation technology and information technology aiming at half-Structured decision problems. DSS can provide necessary data, information and background information for decision-maker, help to make sure decision aim and recognize problem, establish or modify decision model, provide different scheme, appraise and choose from different scheme, process analysis, comparison and judgement, provide necessary support for correct decision. The decision supporting service system is the highest levels of development in the Water resources informatization development. The Water Resources Informatization refers large numbers of information technology. A sort of technology has a great deal of different realization methods and productions. What why integrates application systems developed by all kind of information tech-nology for an organic whole is a main problem needed solve in the Water Resources Informatization development. Therefor we construct information services platform of the Water Resources Informatization operation application systems using web ser-vices technology, to achieve integration of different information technology through middleware technology. The information services platform see Figure 2. 
In the platform, the storage facility stores all sort of information of the Water Re-sources Informatization, mainly including various kind of database, knowledge-based, data warehouse, etc. The platform manager take charge effective management for cooperation of each part in whole platform, mainly providing services like directory service, information publish, load balancing, configuration, certificate authority, ac-and application of the Water Resources Informatization. The main body of the Water Resources Informatization operation applications includes objects, components, mid-dleware, functions, subroutines and etc, which implement the functional logic. And these also can be on different platforms and implemented in any languages. To do so, these modules must firstly be described by WSDL and registered and published in the registration center using UDDI. Web Service is the provider of platform information service and if required, there can be multiple web services, which can provide differ-ent kinds of information services and can be interoperated through SOAP. 
The information service platform is in logic, while it is distributed physically, which is responsible for providing the related services and management of resources. The components of the platform may be constructed on different systems and imple-mented in different languages. And it can X  X  be developed and lie in isolation. It will be upgraded along with the new development of the applications. In another words, the platform is constructed by the development of the applications in accordance with the standards of web service. The Water Resources Informatization is a lengthy complicated process, must follows rule of informatization development. The Water Resources Informatization refers a mass of information technology. The problem what would solve firstly is what inte-grates these information technologies and gets the most of benefit. Otherwise, the Water Resources Informatization will difficult to obtain expectant result. 
Although the web services technology has many problems not solved, but there is no problem running on industry intramural network. The integration model given this paper can solve commendably integration problem of various kind of information technologies, and integrate applications to an organic whole in each moment, each directional. It solves radically problem of data shared and application shared.
