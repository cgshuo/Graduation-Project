 and tools to assist humans in extracting useful information (knowledge) from the rapidly growing volumes of data [1]. This arouses many researchers to study into the area of data mining. One of the data mining functionalities, which plays an important the purpose of being able to use the model to predict the class of objects whose class label is unknown [2]. A variety of techniques have been applied to deal with the classification problems, such as neural networks, decision trees, and statistical methods. However, many previous research works show that neural network classifiers have a better performance, lower classification error rate, and more robust to noise than the other two methods mentioned above. The proposed evolutionary neural network classifier described in this paper employs the concept of the fuzzy c-mean clustering and the evolutionary algorithm to find and optimize the center and the standard deviation of each cluster. The performance of the proposed network is evaluated against the fuzzy ARTMAP, the backpropagation neural network, C4.5, and CART. the architecture of the evolutionary neural network classifier. The learning algorithm is described in section 3. In section 4, the experimental results are demonstrated and discussed. Finally, section 5 is the conclusions. which consists of N nodes. Each node represents a feature component of the input data. The second layer is the cluster layer. The nodes in this second layer are where i is the i th input pattern, and N is the number of features in X. The nodes in the directly transmitted to the cluster layer via these connections. Each node in the cluster its cluster j. where j = 1, 2, ..., M. It denotes the j th node in the cluster layer. winning node. exhibits the highest degree of membership (the winning node). During the training period of the evolutionary neural network classifier, two phases of learning are involved: Phase 1 (Initialize the cluster node) and Phase 2 (Optimize the cluster node). 3.1 Phase 1: Initialize the Cluster Node The fuzzy c-means algorithm is used in this phase to partition the input space into M clusters, which are then used to be the nodes in the cluster layer. The goal of the fuzzy c-means algorithm is to minimize the objective function J m , which is where P is the total number of patterns in the training data set. The detailed procedure of the fuzzy c-means algorithm is as follows: A. Initialize the center values of all clusters. 
B. Calculate  X  ji as follows: C. Update the center value c j by using the following formula: where x i is the i th data in the series. D. Calculate J m using Equation 3. E. If a convergence criterion is reached, stop the loop. Otherwise return to step B. calculated as follows: 3.2 Phase 2: Optimize the Cluster Node After the centers and the widths of the cluster nodes are initially determined in Phase 1, this phase employs the evolutionary algo rithm to optimize those clusters and their description of the process used in this phase is given below. B. Combine the newly generated S-1 chromosomes with the starting chromosome to C. Evaluate the fitness of each chromosome s in the population. The fitness function where S is the total number of chromosomes in the population. D. Create a new population by repeating the following steps S/2 times: E. Combine a new population with the current population. Then select S F. If a predetermined number of iteration is r eached or the end condition is satisfied, To test the performance of the proposed approach, the experiments have been conducted on 6 benchmark data sets: the iris data [3], the vowel recognition problem disorders data [5], and the heart disease problem [6]. three neural network models --the fuzzy ARTMAP, the backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and the proposed model  X  give a perfect accuracy (100%). outpace all three neural network models. Fo r the data set 3, the proposed model comes out to be the best among the compared methods, while the performance of the performance of the three neural network methods. For the data set 5, the best prediction performance (71.68%) is obtained from the fuzzy ARTMAP neural However, the proposed model is not far behind the performance of the fuzzy ARTMAP (50 versus 49 misclassifications). For the data set 6, the proposed model, which yields an accuracy of 85.56%, outperforms other methods by a wide margin. In this paper, the new evolutionary neural network, which applies the concepts of the fuzzy c-means algorithm and the evolutiona ry algorithm to the artificial neural network, is proposed and its performances are compared with two of the best decision neural network are the best among those of the compared methods.
