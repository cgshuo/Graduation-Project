 Abstract Semantic interpretation of language requires extensive and rich lexical knowledge bases (LKB). The Basque WordNet is a LKB based on WordNet and its multilingual counterparts EuroWordNet and the Multilingual Central Repository. This paper reviews the theoretical and practical aspects of the Basque WordNet lexical knowledge base, as well as the steps and methodology followed in its construction. Our methodology is based on the joint development of wordnets and annotated corpora. The Basque WordNet contains 32,456 synsets and 26,565 lemmas, and is complemented by a hand-tagged corpus comprising 59,968 annotations.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for semantic interpretation require lexical knowledge bases (LKB). LKBs are structured lexical resources that organize the information in the lexical entry in order to prevent redundancy. Nowadays, LKBs dominate the lexical-semantic field of NLP, as they offer a number of advantages for knowledge representation: information in the lexical entries can be structured, redundancy can be resolved, data can be controlled, consistence can be achieved and information capture can be made easier. Besides, information can be maintained and updated, including the management of versions.
In order to deal with computational semantics, our research group set the following requirements for the Basque LKB:  X  The LKB should cover a wide range of language phenomena , including  X  It should have a large coverage of the vocabulary , so it can be used in free  X  It should not be linked to a single theory , in other words, it should have the  X  It should be computational , one that can be used in NLP.  X  It should be multilingual , so in addition to lexical entries in Basque, it would
There are many and very different proposals for designing an LKB. We examined and evaluated them according to the above criteria, including theory oriented models X  X ackendoff ( 1990 ), Levin ( 1993 ), Pustejovsky ( 1995 ) X  X nd computational models  X  FrameNet (Fillmore and Baker 2001 ), WordNet (Miller 1985 ; Fellbaum 1998 ), EuroWordNet (Vossen 1997 ), Multilingual Central Repos-itory (MCR) (Atserias et al. 2004 ), Volem (Ferna  X  ndez et al. 2002 ), PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer 2002 ). From our analysis we concluded that the large coverage of WordNet was a very important feature. The proven multilingual extensions of WordNet were also taken into account. Although WordNet misses information in the syntactic-semantics interface, these were left for later develop-ment. 1 Another feature was that there were already several wordnets under development. At present more than 50 national languages are registered within the Global WordNet Association. 2 The Global WordNet Association is a free, public and non-commercial organization that provides a platform for discussing, sharing and connecting wordnets for all languages in the world.

Our team started to build the Basque WordNet following the EuroWordNet design in 2000; and in 2003, in the context of the MEANING Project (Rigau et al. 2003 ), the Basque WordNet was moved to the MCR, an advanced version of EuroWordNet.
 The paper is organized as follows. We first briefly describe WordNet, EuroWordNet and the MCR in Sect. 2 . Section 3 presents the methodology for developing our LKB. Section 4 explains the treatment of linguistic phenomena, giving special attention to the criteria defined for representing them. Finally, Sect. 5 outlines some conclusions and summarizes future work. 2 WordNet, EuroWordNet and the MCR WordNet (Miller 1985 ; Fellbaum 1998 ) is an LKB for English based on psycho-linguistic theories developed at Princeton University. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped together into synonym sets or synsets , each one corresponding to a single lexical concept. For example, the English noun tree has two senses in WordNet, which are represented as two different synsets:  X  1  X  Sense 1 : tree a tall perennial woody plant having a main trunk and branches ...  X  X 
The first sense corresponds to the  X  X lant X  meaning, and the second to the other words, the noun tree in that synset has no other synonym. The second synset contains an additional lexical unit ( tree diagram ), so these two lexical units ( tree and tree diagram ) are synonyms. The lexical unit in each synset is known as a literal . Synonymy is an important relation in WordNet, and the structure of the LKB is based on the meanings of the lexical units; when the same meaning is shared by more than one lexical unit, those lexical units are grouped together into a synset.

In addition to synonymy, WordNet represents several relations. For instance, the hypernymy relation (S1 has hypernym S2) links the synset S1 to the more general synset S2. 3 Hyponymy is the inverse relation. The hypernymy chain and a subset of the hyponyms of the synset corresponding to the first sense of  X  X ree X  in example (1) can be seen in (2) and (3), respectively. 4 (2) Sense 1 3  X  X  Sense 1
Example (2) gives an idea of the WordNet hierarchy or taxonomy, which indi-cates that a tree is a woody plant, which is a vascular plant, which is a plant, which is a life form, which is an entity. In example (3) we show a partial list of kinds of trees. The hypernymy hierarchy can be used to define semantic classes , that is, a synset can be seen as the semantic class that groups all its hyponyms. For example, resenting the  X  X lant X  meaning of tree . We can thus take this synset as the semantic class which brings together all tree species. In the case of verbs, troponymy is used to encode the hierarchy of verbs, where verb Y is a troponym of the verb X if the activity Y is doing X in some manner.

As an illustration of the richness of relations in WordNet we will briefly mention three. Meronymy is used to represent the part of relation between nouns, e.g. a finger is part of a hand and a hand is a part of an arm . Verbal synsets can be related by entailment , e.g. snoring entails sleeping . Adjectival synsets can be linked to nominal synsets with the related -to relation, e.g. nice and niceness .

WordNet is one of the most cited lexical resources in the NLP literature, with more than 44,800 hits in Google Scholar 5 and many applications in wide range of tasks. Moreover, WordNet is freely available, 6 and it is complemented with SemCor, a corpus which is hand-tagged with WordNet senses (Miller et al. 1994 ; Fellbaum et al. 2001 ). 2.1 EuroWordNet The EuroWordNet project (Vossen 1998 ) is a European project that was started in 1996 and went on until 1999, and produced wordnets 7 for eight European languages (English, Danish, Italian, Spanish, German, French, Czech and Estonian). EuroWordNet follows the Princeton WordNet model, but incorporates cross-lingual links. Each language in EuroWordNet has an  X  X  X ndependent X  X  wordnet with its own relations, but the synsets in one language can be linked to the so called Inter-Lingual-Index (ILI), which is largely based on the Princeton WordNet. EuroWord-Net is available from ELRA. 8
In addition to the ILI, EuroWordNet includes several new features. EuroWordNet has more kinds of language-internal relations, and some of the semantic relations of WordNet are refined and/or enriched. Domain ontologies and a Top Ontology were added. The first one organizes synsets according to domains like free time , restaurant ,or traffic . The second one enables relevant synsets of the different wordnets to be classified according to basic semantic features 9 based on linguistic features (e.g. [  X  living], ([  X  agent]).

Finally, EuroWordNet introduced the notion of Base Concepts 10 : the concepts that play the most important role in the various wordnets of different languages, as measured by their high position in the semantic hierarchy and their having many relations to other concepts. The motivation was to reach maximum overlap and compatibility across wordnets in different languages, while at the same time, allow for the distributive development of wordnets in the world. 2.2 The multilingual central repository (MCR) The MCR was devised in the context of MEANING (Rigau et al. 2003 ), a European project which run from 2002 to 2005. The MCR follows the EuroWordNet model, including five languages: Basque, Catalan, English, Italian and Spanish. The wordnets were enriched with new kinds of information, like domain tags for synsets, the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (Niles and Pease 2001 ), or selectional preferences (Agirre and Martinez 2002 ). 3 Methodology for building the Basque WordNet In this section we will present the phases and methodological issues regarding the construction of the Basque WordNet. We will first introduce general issues, followed by the methodology for nouns, and the joint development of a hand-tagged corpus. Finally, we will describe the methodology for verbs. Note that we have not addressed adjectives and adverbs yet. 3.1 Design and methodology There are two main options to create a new wordnet: we could create the Basque WordNet afresh based on Basque corpora and dictionaries, or we could take the Princeton WordNet and translate its synsets into Basque. Vossen ( 1999 ) referred to these two approaches as merge approach and expand approach , respectively.
In the first approach the senses and hierarchies in the Basque WordNet would be independent of the senses and hierarchies in the Princeton WordNet. This involves heavy lexicographic work in order to build the sense inventory and the hypernymy hierarchy. In addition, the multilinguality will require to manually add cross-lingual links to the ILI (cf. Sect. 2.1 ). In the second approach, the work is basically reduced to linking Basque words to the English concepts via the ILI, i.e. we can reuse the synsets and relations in the English wordnet, and translate the literals in the synsets into Basque. We would thus avoid most of the lexicographic work and the need to link Basque synsets to the ILI. On the weak side, there is the risk to misrepresent cultural differences in the sense inventories and hierarchies.

After analyzing the pros and cons of each approach, the decision was taken to use the expand approach, taking the English WordNet as the starting point for building the Basque WordNet. Special care will be placed in detecting cultural differences. For instance, some new concepts will be needed for words like trikitixa  X  X asque accordion and related songs X  X r ikastola  X  X chools where Basque is the main language. In parallel, we also decided to study automatic construction of LKBs from dictionaries, in order to explore the potential of the merge approach and possible combinations (Agirre and Lersundi 2001 ; Lersundi 2005 ). 3.2 Methodology for nouns The methodology to build the Basque WordNet changed during the different stages Basque WordNet, with an emphasis on wide coverage, i.e. the number of lemmas. In this stage, the 1,024 Base Concepts of EuroWordNet (cf. Sect. 2.2 ) were manually translated into Basque, and then Basque-English bilingual dictionaries were used to automatically create Basque equivalents for the rest of English synsets (Agirre et al. 2002 ).

In the next stage, the main goal was to ensure quality. We initially devised two complementary steps. Firstly, a team of linguists manually inspected the automat-ically generated synsets for Basque, concept by concept . In this process the linguists checked to see whether the Basque equivalent for the synset was appropriate or not; and a check was also made to see whether any other equivalents of Basque were needed in the synset. The focus of this process was to ensure that the literals in the Basque synsets were correct. After this inspection was completed, the team embarked on the second step, inspecting the words and the respective synsets word by word , trying to ensure that the main senses of the words as occurring in a dictionary (Elhuyar 1998 ) where properly represented. These two steps involved looking at the same data from two complementary perspectives, ensuring proper quality in the synsets of the Basque WordNet.

Halfway through the word-by-word inspection, we realized that linguists were paying increasing attention to real word examples as occurring in a corpus. In fact, the linguists had to examine existing corpora to check that the main senses of the words were properly represented in the Basque WordNet. Since they were already analyzing the examples of a target word, we thought that they could actually annotate the examples with the senses of the target word, and produce a Basque semantic corpus of our own, which we called Basque SemCor, 11 or EuSemCor for short, following the standard code  X  X  X u X  X  for Basque. This methodology was inspired by Fellbaum et al. ( 2001 ) who propose that dictionaries and corpora should be used together. We thus started the joint development of the Basque WordNet and EuSemCor. 3.3 Joint development of Basque WordNet and EuSemCor First of all, we compiled a corpus of approximately 300,000 words, 12 including samples from a balanced corpus and a newspaper corpus. The goal is to coordinate the tagging of the corpus with the word-to-word review of the Basque WordNet. The synsets corresponding to the target word will be edited according to the examples in the corpus, thus ensuring that the Basque WordNet contains the synsets and literals as used in the corpus.

The motivations of this methodology are the following: (i) the manual annotation of the corpus guarantees that the sense-inventory and sense boundaries fit those found in the corpus (in particular, all senses occurring in the corpus will be reflected in the Basque WordNet), (ii) the senses in the Basque WordNet are tuned to real occurrences of the words, and not only to existing monolingual dictionaries (thus corpus provides a companion resource for enriching Basque WordNet with richer semantic relations acquired from corpora (Atserias et al. 2004 ), including the relative frequency of the senses for a given word, and (iv) the annotated corpus will enable to build word sense disambiguation programs for Basque.

We implemented the joint development with a team of five linguists who had the following roles: one supervisor, one editor, two taggers and one referee. The editor is the one who edits the synsets. The taggers tag the occurrences of the word that needs to be tagged. The referee compares the work of the two taggers and resolves any disagreements. The supervisor coordinates the team.
In short, the methodology followed by this team is as follows. (i) The editor selects a handful of words, 13 edits the synsets corresponding to those words introducing the necessary changes. (ii) The editor tries to convene the meaning of the target words to taggers and referee, ensuring that they have a common understanding. (iii) The taggers tag the occurrences of the target words. (iv) Basque glosses and examples are added to the synsets (Agirre et al. 2005 ). (v) When all these tasks have been completed, the taggers inform the editor and the referee and explain the problems they encountered while tagging. (vi) The referee compares the results of the two taggers, resolving inconsistencies. (vii) In addition, should new senses of the words appear in the corpus, the editor examines whether they should be incorporated into the Basque WordNet for posterior tagging. Figure 1 summarizes this cyclical methodology:
At present, we have applied this methodology to nouns. We organized the tagging of the words starting from the most polysemous nouns. We also reviewed all monosemous nouns in the most frequent list, leaving aside those which we think needed a new sense in the Basque WordNet. These were edited and tagged in the next stage. The words not in the Basque WordNet are mainly proper nouns, but the list needed to be revised, in order to find common nouns that need to be included in the Basque WordNet, and tagged accordingly. The conclusion section shows the current figures for the Basque WordNet.

We next present the agreement figures among the taggers. As already mentioned, each occurrence in the corpus was tagged by two different taggers. The referee had to resolve all disagreements between the taggers. In order to facilitate his work, some statistics, including confusion matrixes and agreement figures, were presented to him. Inter-tagger agreement (ITA) was computed as the ratio between the number of occurrences where the two taggers agreed and the total number of occurrences. In case any of the taggers assigns more than one tag to an occurrence, a tag in common between the two taggers is sufficient to be considered an agreement. Inter-tagger agreement can be misleading for words with different numbers of senses or senses with different distributions, i.e. an agreement of 80% for a word with two senses where one sense accounts for 90% of all occurrences is very low, while it would be a very satisfactory figure for a word with 10 evenly distributed senses.

The Kappa coefficient (Carletta 1996 ) overcomes the shortcomings of the ITA measure by substracting the chance of agreement (given the number and distribution of the senses) and normalizing the result between 0 and 1. Our referee was satisfied with the use of the Kappa figure, but she also found the ITA measure useful as a more intuitive measure of agreement.
 On average, the taggers attained 84% ITA and a Kappa coefficient of 0.68. Tables 1 and 2 show the 5 words with lowest and highest scores, respectively.
We want to mention that Kappa values over 0.7 are deemed reasonable for well-defined tasks. While most of our words (73%) are over this threshold, some words attain very low scores. We have found that most of the disagreements are systematic for each word, i.e. each of the taggers understands differently the sense boundaries and applies his conceptualization systematically, leaving certain kind of occurrences under different senses each. The meetings between the taggers and the referee highlighted that most of these differences were due to an insufficient character-ization of the senses, e.g. when the glosses were not clear enough. These meetings served to review the glosses and sense differentiations in the Basque WordNet, and complement WordNet with a number of examples which have been coherently representative number of tagged examples to supplement the WordNet glosses, the agreement rates would be much higher.

Another reason for the low agreement is that the team could have used more time to prepare each of the words. In contrast to other hand-tagging tasks like part-of-speech tagging or treebanking, sense tagging has the peculiarity that each word is altogether a different task. Knowing and interiorizing the sense boundaries can be very time-consuming, and needs to be repeated for each word. After the tagging-refereeing-editing cycle we are quite sure that the tagged examples and the sense definitions are a coherent set produced by a well-interiorized model of the word. 3.4 Methodology for verbs The methodology for verbs was slightly different. The first step was the same as for nouns, i.e. we attached Basque verbal literals to Base Concepts and then applied automatic methods followed by a synset-to-synset review. But sense distinctions in verbs are different, as well as the hierarchical structure, and verbs encode richer syntactic-semantic information. We therefore performed a study of the suitability of the word-to-word methodology compared to a hierarchical review of senses. The next subsection presents a review of verb sense distinctions, followed by the study and suggested methodology for verbs. 3.4.1 Verbs in WordNet WordNet uses syntactic-semantic information to form verbal synsets. The literals in one synset need to have the same selectional restriction and subcategorization. Failure to abide by this rule will result in the literals being distributed among different synsets. Note for instance the following examples. (4) Mary ate an apple. (5) Mary ate.

In the examples, eat is used as a transitive or intransitive verb (examples (4) and (5) respectively), and therefore WordNet distinguishes two senses ( eat _1 and eat _2) as follows. 6  X  X  eat 1 fg take solid food;  X  X  X he was eating a banana X  X   X  X 
The syntactic-semantic information encoded in the synset also influences the hierarchy and the semantic classes. For instance, each of the synsets in (6) defines a different semantic class: eat _1 has transitive troponyms like gobble , gulp or devour , and eat _2 has intransitive troponyms like dine , snack , picnic and breakfast . In the former, the troponyms indicate  X  X ays of eating X , while the troponyms of the later incorporate the information of that which is eaten.

Unfortunately, bilingual dictionaries don X  X  always include such syntactic-semantic nuances, and the wordnet editor needs to study the syntactic-semantic behavior of the Basque equivalents. For instance, the Basque equivalent of eat ( jan ) also has an intransitive form ( Hagina kendu diote eta ezin du jan [ X  X  X e X  X  had a tooth out and can X  X  eat X  X  X ) and a transitive form ( Bazkaltzeko haragia jan dut [ X  X  X  X  X e had meat for lunch X  X  X ) and thus the two synsets in (6) also apply for Basque. 3.4.2 Analysis for incorporating verbs into the MCR Given the importance of syntactic-semantic features when deciding sense differ-ences and troponyms for verbs, we considered whether a hierarchy oriented edition of the Basque WordNet would be preferred over the word-by-word method we had been using for nouns . Thus, we did two pilot studies following each of the possible methods.

In the word-by-word pilot we chose to study five highly polysemous verbs: esan [ X  X  X o say X  X  X , banandu [ X  X  X o separate X  X  X , banatu [ X  X  X o distribute X  X  X , abestu [ X  X  X o sing X  X  X  and ekarri [ X  X  X o bring X  X  X ). Given the limited syntactic information available in the dictionaries used X  Elhuyar Hiztegia (Elhuyar 1996 ) and the Elhuyar Hiztegi Modernoa (Elhuyar 2000 ) X  X e had to take into account the classification and sub-categorization information included in Aldezabal ( 2004 ). In our experience, this pilot showed that the word-by-word edition ensures that all the senses of the verb are properly edited, but it could lead to errors and imbalances in the hierarchy. For example, some of the literals in a troponym could be more general than the literals of their hypernym, because the editor focused on the word and its senses, but not on the hierarchy. Furthermore, in order to understand the syntactic-semantic informa-tion inherent in some synsets and choose the appropriate Basque literals, the editor had to check the hierarchy, as in the troponyms of eat such as devour or picnic .
For the hierarchy oriented pilot, we chose a hierarchy with an average number of synsets { express _2, give_tongue_ 1, utter _1}, and proceeded top-down starting from the top synset. Using this method the editors were satisfied in that they ensured that the hierarchy was balanced and that the Basque literals had a coherent syntactic-semantic behavior, but they observed that some meanings of the verbs could be easily missed.

Given our experience in the two pilots, we saw that neither method was completely satisfactory. One solution would be to first follow the hierarchies, and later do the word-by-word check, but unfortunately this could be too costly. Another alternative would be to work word-by-word and do limited checks in the immediate hypernym and troponyms of the involved synsets. The advantage of the latter alternative is that it can be coupled with the manual tagging of the verbs in EuSemCor. Given the added value of a coupled WordNet-SemCor development, we concluded that this was the preferred solution, also for verbs. 4 From WordNet to Basque WordNet: distinguishing features and enhancements In this section some distinguishing linguistic features that emerged during the edition of the Basque WordNet will be presented, mentioning how we coded them in the underlying MCR database. Section 4.1 presents some features related to lexicalization. Section 4.2 reviews the hierarchical organization. Finally, Sect. 4.3 presents a proposal for a richer internal representation of multiword expressions (MWE). 4.1 Lexicalization The term lexicalization refers to the transformation of an element (or a sequence of elements) into a unique lexical or conceptual element (Lewandowski 1992 ). The result of lexicalization can be carried out as either a lexical element (a word) or as a sequence of elements (multiword expressions or MWEs).

Lexicalization is a key issue when building wordnets, as the editors need to decide whether a word or sequence of words should be an entry in the wordnet or not. Unfortunately, in practice, the boundaries for lexicalization are very difficult to draw (Contreras and Suen  X  er 2004 ; Cowie et al. 1990 ; Calzolari et al. 2002 ; Sag et al. 2002 ), and this is the reason why the job of deciding whether the word or sequence of words is lexicalized is usually difficult and time consuming. This difficulty becomes apparent when comparing equivalent words in two languages, or, as in this case, when taking one LKB built for one language (WordNet) as the starting point for producing the LKB in another language (Basque WordNet).

In principle, all concepts in WordNet are lexicalized, either by single words ( pet , However, in the process of constructing the network of words and concepts, WordNet developers found that in many cases it was necessary to postulate general concepts that happen not to be lexicalized in English (Fellbaum 1998 ). These general concepts were typically needed to organize the hierarchy of nouns (cf. Sect. 4.2.1 ).

When English literals in one synset are to be translated into appropriate Basque literals, the editor often comes up against lexicalization problems, which we sorted out in two main phenomena: conceptual level imbalances and expression level imbalances.

Conceptual imbalances include mainly cultural concepts , i.e. concepts that appear linked to a particular culture and which do not exist in other languages. For instance, a simnel cake in English is  X  X  X  cake eaten in England around Easter time X  X , and a trikitixa in Basque is a  X  X  X asque accordion X  X . These concepts are expressed in other languages by means of explanations or definitions. In EuroWordNet, such concepts used to be left empty (without literals) and were referred to as cultural gaps (Vossen 1999 ). In our case, we will explicitly encode whether each synset is lexicalized or not.

Expression level imbalances occur when a concept is known in the two languages, but when different expressions are used in each one. For example, some synsets in English are translated into Basque through multiword expressions ( pet : konpainia -animalia ; cook : janaria egin ), or through an inflectional suffix ( cold : these pragmatic gaps, and, in fact, dictionaries are not always consistent. For janaria egin [ X  X  X o cook X  X ; lit.  X  X  X o do food X  X  X  is not, and hotzik is a dictionary entry whereas hotzez is not.

Besides, languages are creative and keep creating new word combinations. In order to decide whether they have to be included in the wordnet, the lexicalization status of the new combination needs to be decided. For the borderline cases, which Vossen ( 1999 ) referred to as pragmatic gaps , EuroWordNet used to leave those synsets blank, as in conceptual imbalances. In our case, aware of the difficulty in ruling on lexicalization, we allow editors to include expressions of doubtful lexicalization in the LKB, as we will see next. 4.1.1 Need for expressions of doubtful lexicalization As a general rule, the criteria used to decide whether or not to incorporate certain equivalents in the LKB are specified according to external factors and the use that one wants to make of the LKB. In our case, we want a Basque WordNet that is a robust foundation for the semantic interpretation of Basque, so that it can be helpful in general NLP tasks, including word sense disambiguation. We thus need to enrich the Basque WordNet with as many literals as possible. On the other hand, ruling accurately the lexicalization status of words and MWEs in Basque is not a priority. Lexicalization decisions can involve lengthy research of their own, and could slow down significantly the development of Basque WordNet. We thus relieved the editors from those difficult decisions, and allow them to incorporate expression of doubtful lexicalization. 4.1.2 Criteria for incorporating Basque literals and marking their lexicalization We developed three criteria for adding Basque literals into a Basque synset, as follows.  X  First criterion : if the Basque expression is a dictionary entry in the following  X  Second criterion : If the Basque expression is an MWE, and if it is not a (a) if the concept can be translated without using a definition in Basque, then the (b) If a definition has to be used to express the concept, then the editor will 8  X  X  Synset number : 01143604 9  X  X  Synset number : 05678078  X  Third criterion : If a form having a plural or inflectional suffix has to be used 4.2 Hierarchical distinctions Since we are using the expand approach, the Basque WordNet follows the same hierarchical classification as WordNet. Basque literals are usually inserted into a synset because they are translations of literals in the English synset and because they share the meaning expressed by the synset, but the editor needs also to maintain coherence in the resulting hierarchy. In this respect, we recognized two major issues. The first arises when a non-lexicalized synset is needed in order to organize the hierarchy, which will be referred to as a conceptual organizer . The second issue arises when the English hypernym X  X yponym literals are lexicalized with the same equivalents in Basque, a problem known as autohyponimy (Cruse 2000 ). These organization of WordNet. We will review each in turn. 4.2.1 Conceptual organizers The term conceptual organizer refers to general concepts devised to organize the hierarchy. They tend to appear at the top of the hierarchy and are necessary for classifying semantic classes. For example, the English synset which groups together the types of characteristics distinguished by sight (color, darkness, texture, etc.) contains the literal visual property . These concepts are listed as exceptions in WordNet, as the authors wanted all synsets to be lexicalized. This concept is not lexicalized in Basque, but it can be used for giving a name to the semantic class that brings together all the synsets that express types of visual properties (150 hyponyms in all). In these cases, we do include the literal, but we explicitly encode that the synset is not lexicalized and that it has been added for the purpose of organizing the hierarchy. For this we use a special mark called NOLEX-GENERAL, as follows. 4.2.2 Hierarchies and lexical specificity For some Basque words, we found that it was not easy to find the right level in the hierarchy. Before going into details we will review autohyponymy . The senses of a polysemous lexical unit can be hypernyms/hyponyms of each other. Basque WordNet, for example, gives the following example: 13  X  X  pertsona 1, gizabanako 1, lagun 15 fg a human being  X  X 
Lagun can thus mean a human being, but also can refer to a friend, where one autohyponymy :
Autohyponymy occurs when a word has a default general sense, and a contextually restricted sense which is more specific in that it denotes a subvariety of the general sense. (Cruse 2000 , p. 110)
Given the methodology to build the Basque WordNet, in the early stages it was possible to generate what we call false autohyponyms . As synsets are translated independently from each other, the same word in Basque can be used both for the hypernym and hyponym, without considering whether these senses in Basque are really distinct. When we started the word-by-word manual editing process (Sect. 3.2 ), more attention was paid to the hierarchy, and it was at that point that it became clear that the Basque hierarchy included significantly more autohyponym synsets than the English hierarchy: there were more than 4,000 autohyponyms in Basque and only 26 in English. Example (14) gives a partial list of the hyponyms of merrymaking, 15 and example (15) the corresponding Basque literals, where parranda was used to lexicalize many of the more specific meanings. (14) {celebration, festivity} (any festival or other celebration) (15) {festa, jai} (event or party organised to celebrate something) 
When doing the word-by-word review and consulting the dictionaries, it was clear that the Basque word parranda did not differentiate all those meanings, and was thus a case of false autohyponymy , in contrast to example (13), which is a genuine autohyponym.

In order to deal with false autohyponymy , it was decided that the lowest hyponyms (insofar as they are translated by a literal in the hypernym) would be left without literals, and a different mark would be used to distinguish them from other non-lexicalized synsets, namely NOLEX-AUTOHYPO. For instance, example (16) shows how we finally coded one of the hyponyms of merrymaking in Basque (the synset corresponding to revelry ). 16  X  X  Synset number : 00328944 We have the impression that Basque has more genuine autohyponyms than English, which could be due to the fact that English has more lexicalized concepts, and a more specific and precise vocabulary. But note also that the process to enrich the Basque WordNet has been done on the basis of the English synsets, which could cause this effect as well. We would need to perform a comparative experiment to check whether this is a key factor or not, perhaps taking a native Basque hierarchical organization, and translating it into English.

Autohyponymy has been also treated in other wordnet projects such as BalkaNet (Stamou et al. 2002 ). In BalkaNet, a set of checks were developed to try to detect coding errors, and autohyponymy review was included in one of those checks (Tufis et al. 2004 ). In other approaches (Gonzalo et al. 2000 ; Peters and Peters 2000 ), autohyponymy has been used as a criteria to cluster senses. 4.3 Semantic internal representation of MWEs in the Basque WordNet MWEs are common place in wordnets, but their internal representation has not been included in WordNet, EuroWordNet or the MCR. Bentivogli and Pianta ( 2002 ) proposed a model for internal representation based on the MWEs of the Italian wordnet. These authors used a composed -of lexical relation between a MWE literal and its component words. In section A of Fig. 2 , the MWE lo egin [ X  X  X o sleep X  X ; lit.  X  X  X o do sleep X  X  X  has been given as an example. This synset, like any other synset, will be semantically linked to its hypernym ( deskantsatu [ X  X  X o rest X  X  X ) and its troponyms ( siesta egin [ X  X  X o have a nap X  X  X , kuluxka bat egin [ X  X  X o doze X  X  X , hibernatu [ X  X  X o hibernate X  X  X , etc.). But in addition, each component ( lo [ X  X  X leep X  X  X  and egin [ X  X  X o X  X  X ) that forms the MWE will have a composed -of link with its corresponding word form, indicating that the MWE in that synset is made up of two word forms belonging to two other synsets.

We will be using the lexical relation composed -of in the Basque WordNet, because the components of the MWEs that are formed compositionally seemed suitable to us for representation purposes. Nevertheless, in addition to that relation, the internal representation of the components making up the MWE can be specified further. For example, this composed -of lexical relation does not express the syntactic-semantic relation between the MWE X  X  components. Let us take the sentence umeak lo egin zuen [ X  X  X he child slept X  X  X ) as an example in which we have a light verb structure: lo egin . Semantically, the composed -of relation in this sentence does not indicate that as part of the act lo egin [ X  X  X o sleep X  X  X  is the situation of being lo [ X  X  X sleep X  X  X . Syntactically, neither does it indicate that the nominal component of this MWE ( lo ) is the syntactic object of the multiword verb expression ( lo egin ) and that the latter will assume a thematic role.

To express syntactic-semantic information, the EuroWordNet lexical relation called involved relation will be taken as the basis. The involved relation starts from a noun (a word form of synset) that expresses a verb or action in order to lexically link it to a concrete or abstract noun (another word form of another synset). For example, the English verb to hammer will be linked to the noun hammer through an involved instrument relation. There are eight types of involved relations: agent , patient , instrument , result , location , direction , source direction and target direction .
In our view the involved relation is highly suited to representing internal structures. In section B of Fig. 2 , one has the representation of the MWE lo egin in which, besides the composed -of relation, the involved relation is also used: the word form lo is the subject of the MWE ( involved patient ), and it enables us to know that lo egotea [ X  X  X eing asleep X  X  X  is necessary for lo egiteko [ X  X  X o go to sleep X  X  X . 5 Conclusions and future work The main outcome of this research is the design and development of a multilingual LKB, the Basque WordNet, which is fundamental for the applied semantic analysis of Basque. We first developed a quick core Basque WordNet using semi-automatic methods that include a concept-to-concept manual review, and later performed an additional word-to-word review that guarantees the quality of the wordnet produced. Moreover, we have also presented our methodology for the joint development of the Basque WordNet and a complementary corpus for Basque, the Basque SemCor (EuSemCor). This methodology consists on editing the words in the Basque WordNet, double-blind tagging of EuSemCor with a referee for adjudication, and a further editing-tagging cycle when required. We have compared this methodology to the hierarchical method, and have concluded that the word-to-word review and joint corpus tagging is the best method to guarantee quality. One shortcoming of the word-to-word method is that we created autohyponyms along the way, but a quick check of the hypernym and hyponyms while doing the review would suffice to prevent this problem in the future.

Tables 3 and 4 show the current figures for the Basque WordNet and the nouns in the EuSemCor, respectively. The figures in Table 3 correspond to the number of senses, lemmas, synsets, lexical gaps and named entities taking into account all Basque WordNet ( Total ), or just nouns ( Nouns ) or verbs ( Verbs ). The lexical gaps correspond to synsets which are not lexicalized in Basque. Named entities correspond to lemmas which are proper nouns, and to synsets that are instances, rather than semantic classes. Table 4 lists separately polysemous, monosemous and those lemmas not in the Basque WordNet. There are two main columns: one for those who have already been tagged, and another taking into account all EuSemCor. In each of these main columns we have the number of lemmas ( Lemmas ) with their respective cooccurrences ( Occurrences ), and two more columns including percent-age with respect to the total for those who have already been tagged. Note that we have tagged the most frequent lemmas, which correspond to 47.8% of all occurrences. Our word-to-word review has gone through 1,015 nominal lemmas, accounting for 72.9% of the total number of occurrences.

We are satisfied for the results so far. The cost of developing both resources jointly might be higher than doing it separately, but the quality justifies the effort, as attested for the improvements of the Basque WordNet after annotating the corpus, and the improved annotation after reviewing WordNet. The joint development guarantees high-quality in both Basque WordNet and EuSemCor.

We have also described the linguistic phenomena that emerge when creating a multilingual LKB, defining the required criteria and enriching the MCR model for representing these issues in wordnets. These criteria cover lexicalization, hierar-chical distinctions, conceptual organizers and autohyponymy issues. In addition we have enriched the wordnet model with a proposal for the internal representation of the internal structure of MWE, which will be also useful to include more internal relations in the wordnets.

In the future, we plan to finish the tagging of polysemous nouns, and the joint review and tagging of verbs. We are also working on the extension of WordNet to particular domains, including the connection to terminological dictionaries using semi-automatic methods (Pociello et al. 2008 ).

We would also like to feed the internal representation of MWEs, perhaps following semi-automatic methods (Agirre and Lersundi 2001 ). Related to this, we would also like to explore the complementarities of the expand and merge approaches. This could involve merging the hierarchies and semantic relations extracted from other Basque dictionaries at a large scale (Agirre et al. 2003 ).
The Basque WordNet is available from ELRA, 16 following the WordNet-LMF dialect of the Lexical Markup Framework (Francopoulo et al. 2007 ). WordNet-LMF is the first application of LMF to wordnet-like applications, and allows for a rich and principled representation of the information contained in wordnets. The release of a free subset is planned in the near future. Both the Basque WordNet and EuSemCor can be browsed online. 17 References
