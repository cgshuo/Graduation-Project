 average precision (MAP) for k = 100 and to measure the correlation in system rankings (Kendall  X  )achievedbythe gold standard and the proposed method. Without formal justification,  X &gt;. 9 has been taken to be good agreement . Furthermore, the qualitative term bias has been ascribed to some methods in assessing their validity.

We present a method to estimate the power and bias of pooling methods, and use our method to evaluate the ef-fectiveness of several pooling alternatives as a function of adjudication effort. The alternatives we investigate are: dif-ferent values of k ; different numbers of topics; move-to-front sampling; using precision at cutoff k ( P @ k )asanalternative to MAP.
Kendall  X  simply counts inversions in rank; as such it con-flates random error  X  error due to chance  X  and systematic error (or bias)  X  error due to measuring the wrong quan-tity. More specifically, it mea sures errors in the sign of the difference between the MAP scores of pairs of systems. It does not account for the magnitude or significance of the dif-ference. We treat random error and bias separately, using apairedt-test 1 to estimate statistical power, and counting the number of significant inversions between the alternative method and the gold standard. Overall, an alternative pool-ing method is good if it has high power, and if its observed bias is insubstantial relative to random error.

We applied this method to various subsets of the topics and judging pool from the TREC 2004 Robust Retrieval Track [7]. In all cases we computed for all pairs of systems the sign of the difference in MAP (or P @ k )andalsothet-test p -value. We compared the sign of the difference to that yielded by the gold standard, and computed the number of inversions when p&lt; X  . 2 Wecomputepowerastheoverall proportion of differences for which p&lt; X  , and bias as the proportion of differences with p&lt; X  whose difference has the opposite sign from the gold standard. If this proportion is substantially less than  X  , bias is a negligible factor (com-pared to random error) in the validity of the estimate, and may be discounted.
Although the applicability of the assumptions have been called into question [6], we found the t-test to be very ac-curate  X  for all methods and sample sizes presented here  X  in predicting inversions in rank using the same method on different topics, therefore establishing its validity. For  X  = . 05 and several values not reported here. necessary to achieve that power for a given n . Each point represents a different value of k . Figure 2 shows that move-to-front pooling [4] yields insubstantially different results. Figure 3, on the other hand, shows that substituting P @ k for MAP yields inferior power.

Figure 4 shows the observed bias for each of the meth-ods, as a function of judging effort. We observe that move-to-front exhibits substantially less bias than methods com-monly taken to be more fair.
Our results support the suggestion that an experimen-tal design using more topics and fewer judgements is more efficient [5], but not the assertion that more regimented se-lection techniques yield lower bias. We advance power and bias analysis as a methodology to supplant rank correlation in assessing new pooling strategies and evaluation measures (e.g. [2, 3, 1]). [1] Aslam, J.
