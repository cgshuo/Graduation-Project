 Social computing harnesses the power of computational methods to study social behav-ior and social context. Behavioral-cultural modeling refers to representing behavior in the abstract and is a convenient and powerful way to conduct virtual experiments and scenario planning. Both social computing and behavioral-cultural modeling are tech-niques designed to achieve a better understanding and prediction of complex behaviors, patterns, and associated outcomes of interest. These approaches are inherently inter-disciplinary and cross disparate disciplines, and they require collaborative efforts to take advantage of the state-of-the-art research in order to document lessons learned and develop novel theories, experiments, and methodologies in terms of social, physical, psychological, and governmental mechanisms.

This special section aims at providing a forum for researchers to disseminate their interdisciplinary and original work in social computing, behavioral-cultural modeling, and prediction. We invited a number of outstanding papers with problem domains ranging from counter-insurgency, economics, crowd behavior, online social media, obe-sity, voting, to cyber security. After several rounds of rigorous reviews by international experts in the corresponding areas, five articles were accepted for this special section of ACM TIST.

In  X  X ptimization-Based Influencing of Village Social Networks in a Counterinsur-gency, X  Hung et al. study the problem of assigning US forces to engage counterinsur-gency (COIN) leaders through nonlethal means to achieve a higher level of long-term attitude influence. They develop an Afghan COIN social influence and a nonlethal targeting model and perform nonlinear programming optimization to maximize the expected long-term attitude of the population. Their simulation results show the optimization-based approach outperforms doctrine-based and random assignments of US forces.
 Gintis discusses his work on market economy in  X  X arkov Models of Social Dynamics: Theory and Applications. X  This work provides an analytical specificity, using Markov processes with agent-based modeling. Gintis considers the problem of decentralized market production and exchange and shows the existence of a stationary Markov process for the dynamics in market exchange. He further illustrates the relationship between Markov processes and agent-based models and discusses simulation results that show market convergence under the proposed Markov process.

Crowd behavior in a potentially violent demonstration can be very challenging to pre-dict. Fridman and Kaminka investigate this problem in  X  X sing Qualitative Reasoning for Social Simulation of Crowds. X  They compare three crowd behavior models and use qualitative reasoning (QR) on these models to predict violent breakouts during demon-strations. Experiments with twenty-four real-life scenarios show that their proposed model outperforms the other two and is sensitive to changes. They further compare the QR techniques with the decision tree approach and found that the machine-learning-based decision tree approach while predicting well, is not sensitive to changes and, thus, may not be viable in assisting the police in the decision-making process.
Information diffusion over large-scale social networks has enabled many social sci-ence studies. In  X  X etecting Changes in Information Diffusion Patterns over Social Networks, X  Saito et al. study the problem of detecting changes in information diffusion networks caused by unknown external factors with limited observations. They develop an efficient algorithm to find the anomalous time window and parameters for proba-bilistic information diffusion models. They show the performance effects of the proposed algorithm for both information-push and -pull styles, based on four different types of real-world datasets.

Advances in social computing have provided insights into traditional non-computing research. Marathe et al. examine a health science problem in  X  X nalysis of Friendship Network and its Role in Explaining Obesity. X  Based on Add Health Data, they develop friendship networks to study the relationship between obesity and social marginaliza-tion. Furthermore, they examine the perceived weight status given the relative weight status among peers in the friendship network.

This collection of works represents interdisciplinary research that brings together values from social computing, behavioral-cultural modeling, and prediction. It is the interplay between distinctive problem interpretations and innovative methodologies that brings great discoveries. The guest editors would like to thank all of the authors who submitted articles to this special section. We are also deeply grateful to all of the referees for their thorough and constructive comments in their high-quality reviews.
