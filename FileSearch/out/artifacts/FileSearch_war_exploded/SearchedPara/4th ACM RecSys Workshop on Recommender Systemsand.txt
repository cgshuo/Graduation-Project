 The new opportunities for applying recommendation tech-niques within Social Web platforms and applications as well as the various new sources of information which have be-come available in the Web 2.0 and can be incorporated in future recommender applications are a strong driving factor in current RS research for various reasons: (1) Social systems by their definition encourage interaction between users and both online content and other users, thus generating new sources of knowledge for recommender sys-tems. Web 2.0 users explicitly provide personal information and implicitly express preferences through their interactions with others and the system (e.g. commenting, friending, rat-ing, etc.). These various new sources of knowledge can be leveraged to improve recommendation techniques and de-velop new strategies which focus on social recommendation. (2) New application areas for recommender systems emerge with the popularity of the Social Web. Recommenders can not only be used to sort and filter Web 2.0 and social network information, they can also support users in the information sharing process, e.g., by recommending suitable tags during folksonomy development. (3) Recommender technology can assist Social Web systems through increasing adoption and participation and sustain-ing membership. Through targeted and timely intervention which stimulates traffic and interaction, recommender tech-nology can play its role in sustaining the success of the Social Web. (4) The Social Web also presents new challenges for recom-mender systems, such as the complicated nature of human-to-human interaction which comes into play when recom-mending people and can require more interactive and richer recommender systems user interfaces.

The goal of this workshop, which continuous a series of successful RSWeb-Workshops since ACM RecSys 2009, was to bring together researchers and practitioners to explore, discuss, and understand challenges and new opportunities for recommender systems and the Social Web.
