 1. Introduction
The world economic crisis has forced airlines to modify the way in which they are operating: improving productivity and reducing costs. Modern airports can be extremely complex organizations, which often involve governmental organizations, private compa-nies, airlines, aircraft operations and airport operators ( Ashford et al., 1998 ). New ideas like common use are emphasizing cost reduction to improve productivity. The concept of  X  X  X ommon Use Model X  X  indicates that airport operators can gain centralized control over facilities and technologies, increase passenger-processing options and acquire shared use efficiencies as they move from exclusive use toward common use. Airport common usable space is defined as the space in which any airline may operate and as space that is not specifically dedicated to any single airline. In this model, all airline usable airport space is available to be used by any airline. The goal of the full  X  X  X ommon Use Model X  X  is to minimize the amount of time any given airline resource is not in use, as well as to maximize the full use of the airport ( Belliotti, 2008 ). Airports benefit from increased utilization of existing resources. In a full common use airport, airlines are assigned with no preferences given to any individual airline, similar to the air traffic control process. To manage resources properly, computer software and systems are put in place to perform complex calculations, monitor usage and provide status reporting.

In the  X  X  X ommon Use Model X  X , the ground handling (GH) companies are the key point because of their central role. The GH companies have to provide service to different types of incoming flights, airlines, passenger, cargo services, etc., while working in a dynamic and safety restricted shared environment. These compa-nies need to reduce costs and offer accurate results to the service contract with the airlines to avoid been charged for delays. In most of cases, GH companies are directly hired by airlines in a rigid contract to assist with supplies. The way to reduce costs is to optimize the resources attending the incoming flights. The opti-mization is focused on the reduction of the number of resources and the time to assist a flight to increase productivity.
New control systems are steadily increasing their complexity due to pressing requirements for productivity and flexibility. This complexity becomes especially poignant when dealing with typically big plants, airports or centers for logistics; where the usual control is too rigid and hard to manage, maintain and update ( Thorne et al., 2007 ). This control is based on continual planning algorithms ( DesJardins et al., 1999 ), which presents three specific information deficiencies in distributed shop floor operations ( Brenner and Nebel, 2009 ). Three requirements that are especially relevant to provide decision support in high volatile industrial environments are:
The usage of the resources : it is not easy to know when a resource is available or busy. The information feedback of the state of the resources is complex with a high dependency on the surrounding environment.

The expected duration of the processes: considered as a single task each process has different lengths depending on the a broad range of possible new situations must be business-as-usual and this should apply even while the system is being modified/ updated ( Garcia et al., 2003 ). Thus, distributed control becomes standard practice as it allows a division of the problem in smaller and more affordable ones. In this case, the control system relies on a negotiation process to take decisions that affect more than one of its parts ( Durfee, 1996 ). The need for an improvement in the connection between the real environment and the information systems is essential ( Sandholm, 1999 ); Enterprise Resource Plan-ning (ERPs), expert systems or other new information/manage-ment systems have given place to new architectures, which need constant feedback of information on the real environment. tracking information on resources using RFID tags attached to mobile resources that are used at ground handling operations ( Sung et al., 2007 ). This new visibility framework based on RFID is a powerful tool to help distributed continual planning because of the continuous information feedback about the resources it provides. Following these ideas, the new control system ( Fig. 1 ) needs to integrate heterogeneous information coming from the manufacturing/logistics environment through elements such as sensors (RFID or Barcode) or actuators (PLC, Robots or simple actuators) as well as from more complex information systems as ERP, WMS or even expert systems.
 environments, it is necessary to take short-term and even online decisions whenever deviations or disturbances from the plan arise ( Sch  X  onberger and Kopfer, 2007 ). These assignment tasks are closely related to the processes of review, control, planning, updating of information and 24-h-data availability. The current scheduling/planning operations, usually centralized at a control department, are based on software tools with a great lack of field communication. To adapt these tools, new ideas and concepts coming from those used at the development of Intelligent
Manufacturing Systems (IMS) can be applied in distributed planning and decision making ( Abramovici and Filos, 2009 ). The current trend is to manage the information using new concepts as alignment, agile manufacturing, or interoperability. Most of these are being implemented through new artificial intelligent techniques such as Bayesian networks ( Jensen, 1996 ), multiagent systems ( Bussman et al., 2004 ), Neural networks ( Yu et al., 2009 ) or Fuzzy systems ( Lee et al., 2008 ), which define expert DSS capable of adapting to disturbances.

The key contribution of the research is therefore the robust combination of MAS, DSS and WSN by taking advantages of all their individual features. The proposed combined framework is being implemented at the Ciudad Real Central Airport in Spain. This is a small airport and its demand is based on low cost companies and cargo operations. The airport wants to improve the productivity of ground handling resources by reducing delays, overloads and over-staff. This will reduce costs, following the path set by low cost companies. In the case at hand, software and hardware had to be developed from scratch and particularized to this airport. Thus, the first step was to develop a pre-validation environment that was presentedasademoshowattheairport.Thismadepossiblethe testing of the proposed MAS and the combination of ICTs before the deployment of the complete system. 2. WSN TO improve the visibility in high volatile environments
The first important stage towards making sound decisions is to gather the appropriate information. Even more so whenever the decision support system is to efficiently operate in real time conditions. Following the three requirements presented in the previous section; this DSS uses a combination of the technologies
RFID and Zigbee to track the resources at an airport, a factory or a logistics center. The identified resources can be vehicles, products, pallets, machinery and employees. The idea is based on having a
WSN capable to cover big distances and track resources on specific zones through the use of all the capabilities of RFID, especially those about identification, and not just to primarily activate/deactivate the WSN modules ( Medagliani et al., 2010 ).
The analyzed technologies of communication between readers were WIFI, WIMAX and Zigbee. The reasons for selecting Zigbee were its characteristics of acceptable distances, auto routing capability, low consumption and a sufficient bandwidth. Zigbee is a specification of a set of high-level protocols for wireless communication, for use with low-power digital radios, based on
IEEE 802.15.4 Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN). These applications require secure communication with low data trans-mission rates and maximization of battery life, following the current technological developments and trends ( Ansari et al., 2009 ). Its main features are the low consumption, the mesh network topology and its easy integration (nodes can be manu-factured with very little electronics). Zigbee network topologies allow three alternatives: star, tree and mesh. For the situation in hand, the mesh topology is particularly interesting, allowing to maintain the communications even in the event of failure in one or more of the Zigbee nodes; as new routes can be recalculated by the coordinator node. In the tested Zigbee system, the commu-nication module can cover around 400 m with a rate of 250 kb/s, performing a large number of identifications per second between nodes. In this option, the bottleneck is the read speed of the RFID reader because of the implemented anti-collision protocol. RFID is the technology of choice for product identification, which has a multi-level standard: the Electronic Product Code (EPC).
In the case of airports, information has to be shared in real time between ground handling companies, airlines, airport suppliers and air traffic control. From the point of view of ground handling, the use of the EPC standard provides a transparent way to share the information of this WSN among the agents involved, which is a key factor to be addressed in multi-company industrial environ-ments. Using WSN based on Zigbee with RFID reader nodes, the time, focus in localized points with a common data model. The communication architecture is depicted in Fig. 2 . The proposed end nodes can cost around 12 X 15$, with an acceptable reading rate of around 10 X 12 m. The need for this distance is so as to locate the position of resources within specified areas such as a door or gate. The benefits of this combination of technologies are:
The information flows around the dynamic nodes to the gateway or to the coordinator of the network in a trans-parent way.

RFID identifies the sensorized elements through EPC, which is a standard for identification and communication protocols. The WSN allows covering big distances in a dynamic way and RFID focuses the identifications in specific zones.

The cost of the RFID end nodes (10 X 12$) is low compared with other existing devices.

The battery consumption of RFID tag devices in the mobile nodes is really low compared with other electronic devices like mobile phones.

The possibility of auto routing of packages in case of node failure in the WSN is guaranteed using Zigbee. 3. ZigID: the proposed WSN in three levels
Using the proposed technologies, this section presents a WSN architecture divided in three levels of elements ( Fig. 3 ). The division is based on an adaptation of the adequate hardware devices to each application. The first level, or mobile-device level, is the end node level. The features of these end nodes are low consumptions, integrated sensors, short cover distances and identification process. The objective of the second level is the communication and routing of the information provided by the end nodes; this is the routing level. The third and last level is the coordination level, which has the function of coordination and provides an interface with the existing information systems. 3.1. End node level
Hardware devices on this level are attached to the resources to be tracked, thus being mobile devices. The functionality of this level is to communicate the identification of the resource to the
WSN through an active RFID communication. At this level, there are some limitations: the use of batteries, the computation capacity and the communication bandwidth.

The proposed devices are active tags with sensors; which means that the tag needs to have batteries. The elements that compose the device being used in this example are, basically, a microcontroller and a transceiver. The microcontroller is a
PIC16F819 made by Microchip. The main feature of this micro is its low power consumption (7 m A); as it integrates the use of nano-Watt Technology. The microcontroller is in charge of mana-ging the operations of the end node: communications with routers and data acquisition from sensors.

The transceiver is the nRF905 made by Nordic. It makes possible the communication between nodes and routers. NRF905 is a RF transmitter/receiver that operates in the UHF band. It is configur-able to work at 433, 868 and 915 MHz. It also has different transmission power modes from 10 dBm to 10 dBm, allowing for a high read range with low consumption. It is commanded through a Synchronous Serial Port, SPI.

Other elements of the node are the antenna, sensors and batteries. The antenna is a dipole printed on the board, of the type known as patch. The node can operate different sensors to measure temperature, acceleration (shocks), fuel and chemicals detectors among others. Two conventional AAA batteries provide the required power supply.

Some tests are being carried out to calculate the autonomy of the end node. It is estimated to last an overall of 284,495 h, for a duty cycle where there is a RF communication every 2 s with a duration around 0.1 s in each transfer. This measurement has been realized at 10 dBm, which is the higher power the device can manage. It is necessary to optimize the communication protocol in order to increase the autonomy. 3.2. Router level
The second level takes charge of the routing of the information to the coordinator; this level has two communication protocols: one gets the information from the end nodes through RFID, the other routes the information to the network coordinator using Zigbee.
Sometimes, the management staff needs to improve the visibility in real time; therefore, it is necessary to be able to add new devices in the WSN on a dynamic way. This requirement calls for a specialization in the software, which will be explained in the next section. Other functionality of this device is the filtering of the unnecessary information, as redundant or not well-defined information, in order to avoid blocking the communication with massive traffic.
 ments, the design of the Zigbee network must always count on the possibility of different routing paths, especially since these devices are powered with batteries. This was one of the main concerns expressed by the end users. The functionality of this level is the communication with the end nodes by RFID and the routing of the packages in the WSN through Zigbee.

JN5139 by Jennic and an nrF905. As in the previous case, the nRF905 is in charge of the RFID communication. The JN5139 is a module that enables the implementation of Zigbee networks.
There are two types of these Jennic modules. For this develop-ment, the high power one has been used. It can transmit with a maximum power of 19 dBm, and up to 4 km according to the IC data-sheet ( NXPSemiconductors, 2011 ), although what we have achieved is read ranges of about 400 m in a real environment.
JN5139 also includes microcontroller features, allowing for the control of serial communications and input/output pins. This way,
JN5139 manages the Zigbee network, the RFID communications and some buttons and leds.
 option is to plug them in the power grid. In isolated places, the use of high-capacity rechargeable batteries with alternative power sources, like photocells, would cope with the autonomy problem. This paper also describes how the improvement of energy management of the batteries has been achieved to increase battery-life. 3.3. Coordinator level with the information systems. The information captured by the
WSN becomes adequately formatted in XML and/or is submitted in a query to a database. During the implementation of this prototype, the coordinator submitted all the information to an
EPC repository ( EPCGlobal, 2007 ), which is accessible to the rest of the systems of the airport.
 called Pan Coordinator. It selects the frequency channel to be used by the network (usually the one with the least detected activity); then, it starts the network and, finally, it allows child nodes to connect to it (that is, to join the network). It can also provide message routing, security management and other services. The prototype has been developed to allow direct USB communication with a personal computer; future developments may also include
Ethernet communication. 3.4. The information flow on ZigID
Based on the WSN describe before, a data model needs to be defined in order to describe an information flow that satisfies the global requirements. The data model defines the object event as the main data shared object in the network, while defining the management event as internal information to maintain the facilities on the network. This data model is in concordance with the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard using the Fosstrak implementation ( Floerkemeier et al., 2007 ).
The object event is composed by specific data as reader ID, location, timestamp or even the specific business step being processed. The object event is serialized in the router node and it is communicated to the rest of the WSN. The steps of the data in the WSN are defined in Fig. 4 as: 1. The end node has the stored information in its local memory while its sensors are taking data from the environment. 2. The reader router node receives the information through RFID. 3. The router node prepares the object event. 4. The sent object event is routed in the WSN. 5. The Coordinator receives the object event and sends the data to the existing information systems.

The object event is a software structure that represents the information definition step, which may include far more informa-tion than a simple identification. When the reader router node establishes a communication with an end node this one sends the identification EPC, the value of the variables about the sensors and a timestamp. After that, the reader router node, with the information from the end node, composes the object event adding also information about itself, like the location of the reader, the ID of the reader or the business process. Then, this object event is uploaded to the WSN. When the package arrives to the coordi-nator, it defines a XML file to transmit the data to the information system. During the demo, the XML generates a query that is submitted to an EPC Repository. The other type of object defined in the data model is a management package that contains status information about the end nodes and router nodes such as: the state of the batteries, problems with the antennas, routing problems, fallen devices or Zigbee exceptions. Many of these exceptions are caught by the functionality of the Zigbee stack. With a proper definition of this stack, the coordinator will tackle many problems in the network, generating alarms or specific recovery events. 4. Intelligent product driven DSS: MAS  X  EPC
Once the information from the environment is correctly updated, sound decisions might be taken. In this section, the possibility of using MAS to appropriately use the data is studied, prior to the development of the DSS for the management of handling operations at airports.

As a new information system paradigm, manufacturing agent/ holon based systems were developed to provide a high degree of specialization/autonomy in distributed DSS ( Martinez Lastra and Colombo, 2006 ). Among the main MAS methodologies used on manufacturing planning ( Leit ~ ao, 2009 ), some of the most impor-tant are: the PROSA methodology by Van Brussel et al. (1998) , the Plant Automation Based on Distributed Systems (PABADIS) project of L  X  uder et al. (2004) or ExPlanTech by the Gerstner Laboratory ( Pechoucek et al., 2002 ). They focus the manufacturing decision making on using distributed reasoning systems through an agent-based approach. Other agent based systems that can be applied to this environment are extensions of the knowledge oriented methodologies, such as: the MAS-Common KADS devel-oped by Iglesias et al. that can be found in the book by Singh et al. ( Iglesias et al., 1996 ) on intelligent agents; or the CoMoMAS proposed by Glaser (1997) . There are also reference agent meth-odologies based in roles like MASE ( Zhang and Lukose, 1998 )or GAIA ( Wooldridge et al., 2000 ) based on a macro-level (social) and micro-level (agent) that could be applied in manufacturing. Another valid example is the proposed by Zhang (2007) , which comes from the supply chain environment and is based on simulation and decision making tools. Most of these develop-ments include the combined use of emerging decision making technologies in manufacturing/logistics as tools for agent based technologies, like MAS planning ( de Weerdt and Clement, 2009; Pechoucek et al., 2007 ), Markov Decision Process application ( Puterman, 1994 ), Game-Theory techniques ( Krajewska et al., 2008 ) or applied Bayesian Networks ( Shoham and Leyton-Brown, 2009 ). This list of methodologies highlights that, to apply MAS, ad-hoc software and hardware frameworks are necessary to properly address the complexity of the analysis of real systems. On this line, this work proposes the integration of the visibility frameworks with MAS, which support product driven DSS based on constant RFID visibility.

Real systems usually incorporate control elements that are closely related to the physical world including assets, products and resources, as they command machinery or moving objects. Other control elements for these systems can be seen as more concerned with management strategies or business intelligence as ERPs or ICTs. It seems adequate to maintain this differentiation in the MAS structure by defining and characterizing two different agent platforms: physical agents and information system agents. To implement both types of agents in a very direct and relatively easy way, they can be endowed by associated information defining their beliefs, desires and intentions as well as their interaction capabilities  X  which constitutes the BDI approach discussed in Wooldridge et al. (2000) . The basic components of BDI agents are: data structures, which represent their beliefs, desires and intentions and functions, which represent the delib-eration process and methods. Some models, like PROSA, allow a common definition of all physical agents (product, resources and orders) at the same physical level. This is an effective initial approach, but for the fact that its implementation requires a reasoning specialization to support interaction with machinery, PLCs or robots. A service-oriented implementation of this communication with the plant appears to be especially relevant.
Some authors emphasize the online feedback of data as one of the benefits of using agent based systems due to its flexibility and its
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) features. This characteristic helps tackle the well-known problems of the lack of field information at the upper logistics and manufacturing levels ( Panetto and Molina, 2008 ). This feature is based on the adapt-ability of the BDI reasoning, which provides a mechanism for separating the activity of selecting a plan from that of obtaining beliefs about the environment and from performing their execu-tion process. The proposed division into two agent platforms allows defining specialized software units that better feed their internal beliefs during the reasoning process as they match the information flow that actually takes place at the manufacturing/ logistics environment. 4.1. Customization of BDI agents to provide product driven negotiation
Based on this capacity of customization, a division of the manufacturing agent spaces is proposed. The agents closer to the physical environment, which can be named BDI physical agents, are most likely to be directly benefited from visibility frameworks through a software interface as the standard EPC
Information Services (EPCIS) infrastructure. This work takes in charge of these agents, and how they can provide a middleware
DSS between the physical elements and the upper information systems ( Fig. 5 ).

This type of agents takes charge of real-time information coming from the plant and its circumstances, reporting treated information to upper levels of agents. In practice, these agents are constituted by sets of software and hardware interfaces defining a specific functionality of the plant. Beliefs of the agent are refreshed by the EPCIS through its XML specification, generating a proper picture of the real state of the resource. The package has the EPC and extra information like position, timestamp and context. This information can place request such as: What entities are the subject of the event? When did the event occur? Where did the event occur? And as a conclusion: Why did a particular event happen? For example, in the tested case of GH operations, the subscription can respond to what GH resources are the subject of the event, the time when the event took place, the location where the resources are situated on the terminal and what is the state or the business context of the resource, whether the resources is free, busy or in transit. With an EPC subscription process, any event of the resource in the tracking area will be submitted to its specific agent. This allows an abstraction with minimum coupling to specific physical details of the environment.

System (PRS) with an RFID event updated database. It is a framework for constructing real-time product driven reasoning systems that can perform decision-making in dynamic environ-ments. From a coordination point of view, the physical agent platform is a product driven approach, where the products compete for shared resources or processes, and this competition requires a negotiation. These low level actions taken by the physical agent after competitive coordination define a plan; these reactive actions have a constant great dependency of the state of the products. Therefore, the static paradigms as object oriented or structure programming, seem inadequate because the require-ments of constant negotiation and information feedback between the elements.
 customized BDI reasoning in the physical BDI agents. The first steps are the initialization and the subscription of tracking the linked resource (point 1 and 2). Then, if there is any EPC event, which means a  X  X  X hat? X  X ,  X  X  X here? X  X ,  X  X  X hen? X  X  or  X  X  X hy? X  X  varia-tion, the loop executes several instructions: the generation of new options (point 3.a) and a deliberation based on Markov Decision
Process (MDP) (point 3.b). The confirmation and execution of the selected options (points 3.c and 3.d) generates new external events based on its own intentions (point 3.e). And finally, the unsuccessful and impossible attitudes are dropped from the option list of instructions in the next loop (points 3.f and 3.g). 4.2. Negotiation protocol based on the Markov parameters negotiation, provide their outcomes using a decision-making technique based on Markov Decision Process (MDP). This paper proposes an adaptation of the MDP, in which its reward function reflects a strategic decision-making in every single operational decision of the physical elements. The value function V P specifies the value of the policy P in the state S with the state a.
This policy will define the decision-making process in every state of the system, even when disturbances occur. This internal reason-ing for the selection and execution of the intentions is based in a set of states ( s ), a set of actions ( a ) for transaction between current and future states ( s and s 0 ), a collection of probability functions of discount rate ( g ) and the reward function ( R )definedbythe company (Eq. (1)).
 Q n  X  s , a  X  X  R  X  s  X  X  g R  X  s  X  X  X  AB CD  X 
This equation is the basis of the dynamic programming, where function Q n represents the reward value of the chosen option in the space of possible actions and all its previously selected steps.
Function V is the election of the maximum reward in the space of possible options obtained by function Q * . The reward function R is obtained using the parameters submitted by the ERP systems ( A , B , C , D ) and the continuously generated beliefs of the physical agents (Delay, Cost, Quality of Service, Energy). For example, in the
GH test case, electrical stairs can obtain a better reward than manual stairs as the required time is shorter and the cost is adequate to assist an incoming Boeing 737 in the parking 1, following the reward parameters defined by the company.

Combining the BDI and MDP techniques, the internal beliefs situate the agent in one of the defined states in the MDP. The desires are the goal state or final state on the MDP that the agents want to achieve. The intentions of the agent specify the actions that will define state transitions; they allow the generation of a plan based on the Markov parameters defined by strategic levels.
Besides, these intelligent plans can generate new suitable beliefs depending on the chosen options generated in the selection of the plan and its growing knowledge of the system. These new internal beliefs are really useful during the decision process because they are the result of the reasoning process while striving to meet a goal. The obtained beliefs can be directly applied as decision-making parameters and provide information focused to possible solutions, even when using data coming from other operators.
Furthermore, these revised beliefs simplify the following delib-erations. Some examples of possible internal beliefs are: the cost of the plan (financial results), the energy consumed during the selected execution (sustainable policies) or the client valuation in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM). Therefore, there is an internal MDP in each physical agent, which chooses those actions with the maximum reward while taking it closer to the goal state. The reward function of the MDP can be customized to the needs of the company, which can be based on the importance of the delays, on the costs of the process, on the importance of the client, on power consumption or on a combination of all of them; with a specific quantity parameter to reach a selected value in every decision. In the proposed test case, the reward function depends on the value of 4 parameters defined by the company. The average reward is defined as the limit of the sum of rewards divided by the number of states ( s ) (Eq. (2)): R  X  s  X  X  A n Time  X  s  X  X  B n Cost  X  s  X  X  C n QoS  X  s  X  X  D
With the internal decision policy of the company in mind, if the firm wants to reduce costs or the consumption of energy relative to environmental issues, it will increase B or D . The firm will then give more importance to the different costs in every single action, instead of focusing the actions in reducing the delays ( A ) or improving the results for a specific client ( C ). With a correct customization of the parameters, the company can define a dynamic decision policy during operations. This method pro-vides well-formed decisions in the operational level with a limited communication with the neighbor nodes of the Supply
Chain Management (SCM). Every single decision is validated by the information system platform using the propose interaction protocol defined by FIPA. The results, which are the reward value and the new beliefs, are sent to the ERP for their validation using FIPA proposal messages.

The proposal is negotiated using the contract net protocol between the agents of the I.S. platform. In the test case there were three agents: the ERP agent, the CRM agent and an expert system agent. If the proposed solution is accepted, the physical agents execute the plan. Otherwise the proposal is rejected and the physical agent has to recalculate the plan with new Markov
Parameters provided by the I.S. platform. The information flow between platforms is detailed in Fig. 7 .

On airport operations for instance ( Fig. 8 ), the aircraft operator submits a data event when the entire crew is ready at the terminal  X  this is represented by the red circle containing the number 1  X  which is submitted by the aircraft operator capturing application. At the same time, the sent data can be used in the business model of the remaining companies. In this case, the new event allows starting other processes like those represented by the blue circle containing the number 3. 5. Test case: the Ciudad Real Airport
The goal is to develop a WSN to improve the visibility in the terminal to help with resource management at the new Ciudad
Real Central Airport ( Fig. 9 ). This airport entered in operation at the beginning of 2008 at Ciudad Real (Spain). The airport focuses in the low cost market; which means that it needs to reduce costs in ground handling operations, in airline management and in other airport operations. The design of the airport is based in a hub with four aircraft parking positions facing the passenger gates. Close to the main parking there is a secondary bigger area for long time parking.

To improve operations, the proposed solution tool allocates resources to incoming flights through the WSN  X  MAS. The data thus obtained is presented in a user interface that can run/show the state of the resources in different ways. This visualization tool helps airport management to identify possible conflict situations, thus improving the decision making process. As was said in the introduction, the formatted information coming from the WSN will be used in an artificial intelligent process.

Before the real implementation, a demo of the application based on the installations of the airport, has been carried out. This first validation step includes end nodes in the majority of resources and selected positions for the router nodes. To begin with, the airport staff wanted to know if the resources were free or busy. The defined positions for busy resources were the four-parking-spaces hub in front of the gates plus  X  X  X esources in transit X  X . The resources are considered free when they are in the hangars for ground handling resources. The idea of the association of resources with their involved process has also been analyzed.
The system can generate alarms or re-calculate the planning when there are delays in the expected forecast plan.
 nodes are being carried by the mobile ground-handling resources.
The router nodes are situated in the principal parking positions and the hangars of resources; with this deployment, the distances between routers is always shorter than 400 m. Furthermore, minor paths have been defined for all the routes.
 information such as:
Fig. 11 shows the interface of the application during the demo realized to the airport management staff. On the left, the interface shows the time information and the free resources that are in the hangar. The application has a player with a time bar; which can be taken forward or backward to get the historical representation of the information captured by the WSN and the most suitable decision depending on the ERP parameters. On the right, there are four pictures with the incoming aircrafts and all the resources that are attending the flights. The identified resources by the WSN are shown in this interface around the aircraft. The airport staff provided a very positive feedback in which they especially appreciated that, with a brief look at the interface; they could get a well-formed picture of the state of the ground handling resources in the airport.

The airport management staff fixed the ERP parameters of the reward function to reduce delays, direct costs and consumed energy. QoS is not represented in the reward function because initially the airport staff did not want to give priority to any specific airline. The reward function is represented in Eq. (3) R  X  s  X  X  0 : 5 n Time  X  s  X  X  0 : 4 n Cost  X  s  X  X  0 : 1 n Energy  X  s  X  X  3  X 
The tests that were launched during the demo show were based on the scheduling of a standard workday in the airport. The GH tasks correspond to the definition of processes by the Ciudad
Real Central Airport in the attendance of a Boeing B737 during the standard 45 min scale. Besides, the probability of just in time resources was obtained from the information of other Spanish airports as Malaga Airport. The results provided a better fit than the initial dimensioning performed by a major consultancy because there was a reflection of the environmental details in every decision. The comments of the airport staff was that this
DSS really takes into account the physical details of the terminal, and it makes possible to place the focus on the accurate dimen-sioning of the resources with the real requirements of the airport.
The comparative of the results based on the usage of resources is analyzed in 4 flights per hour, since this is the expected frequency of flights. In Fig. 12 four tests are represented as performed by the
MAS, comparing several configurations with the results obtained by the consultancy. The results are divided by several expected delays in the overall attendance process: 5 min guarantee, just in time or with a specified delay. Before the real deployment, these results help airport management to realize an accurate dimen-sioning of the required resources in defined situations, so as to be able to attend the incoming flights following the established policy as expressed in the definition of the decision making process.

These results have been obtained in a small airport, but the scalability of the MAS make possible its deployment in bigger airports. Therefore, the MAS retain its capacity to represent complexity during analysis and development while the well-formed DSS capacity grows exponentially in bigger and more complex cases. 6. Conclusions
The result of this work is the robust combination of a WSN based on RFID as identification technology and Zigbee as com-munication technology as well as its real implementation in an airport. The existing developed standards abstract the implemen-tation of the low layers of the WSN, focusing the work in the deployment of software, the definition of the data model and the specification of final user requirements. The aim of the WSN is to cover big distances in the environment while performing the identification in defined zones with a flexible data model that allows adding new devices or new information online.

The proposed WSN is based on a three-level architecture composed by an end node level (RFID), a router level (RFID  X  Zigbee) and a coordinator level (Zigbee  X  Database). Due to the requirements of this outdoor mobile application, an energy efficient management was necessary. This work proposes differ-ent software techniques based on power adaptability, ultra low power consumption modes and efficiency routing; getting high performance consumption ratios.

Once the information is captured, agent-based technology stands up as appropriate to address complex tasks of planning operations along the supply chain. The main reasons are: its scalability, its capacity of negotiation and its ability to implement artificial intelligent techniques. More specifically, the combina-tion of agent based and identification technologies has been considered as a proper way to manage the short-term planning required to allocate multiple resources in highly dynamic envir-onments using a product driven approach.

Complementing the DSS, a visual software tool has been developed to manage ground-handling resources that assist the incoming flight in the Ciudad Real Central Airport. The airport staff had a very positive reaction towards the application once they got familiarized with the demo version. This was mainly due to the ease of use, the simplicity and the directness in which visual information was provided.
