 With the increasing popularity of microblogging services such as Twitter 1 , Plurk 2 , and Tumblr 3 , huge volume of very short messages can be generated in realtime that reflect some issues in microblogs. First, huge volumes of messages with diverse topics make it difficult for users to track events of interests. Second, since each microblog message is limited to 140 characters in length, inaccurate, fragmental, and opinionated infor-mation often makes it difficult to get the major points. Thus, we need a way to identi-fy hot topics and analyze opinions from huge amount of short messages. 
Existing methods for tracking latest updates include event detection, trend detec-tion, and text summarization. These methods usually target at ordinary documents, news articles, or Web pages which have sufficient content features for applying con-ordinary documents. Conventional features such as TF-IDF weights might not be directly used in similarity estimation. Second, structural relations such as replies, comments, and forwards might imply endorsements from readers. It would be helpful huge volume of short texts with rich emotional information might be helpful if we can summarize the overall opinion on interesting topics. 
In this paper, we propose an opinion aggregation approach based on message in-fluence estimation and hot topic detection in microblogs. In order not to violate user incorporate structural statistics among messages such as replies, forwards, and likes to help compensate the insufficiency of content features. First, we estimate the message influence by combining content features with simple structural statistics including number of forwards and URIs (Uniform Resource Indicators). Then, we further inte-grate the influence persistence by the duration of responses to give the overall influ-ence score. Finally, daily hot topics are identified from popular messages, and opinion orientations are accumulated from the corresponding responses. 
In our experiments, Plurk is used as our major source of microblog data since it is among the top-50 sites, and one of the most popular microblogging sites in Taiwan 4 . During our data collection period, more th an 320k plurks with more than 1.8 million responses were collected. Influence score of each message is used to classify its popu-larity. Then, the aggregated opinions on popular messages are compared with the final result of 2012 Taiwan Presidential Election. Specifically, the experimental results showed a high accuracy of 98.74% in aggregated opinions. Further investigation is needed to verify potential applications in opinion aggregation for other domains. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review re-lated works. The proposed approach is described in Section 3. We detailed the expe-Section 5. Finally, in Section 6, we list our conclusions. There has been much research on microblogs especially for Twitter. Kwak et al. [5] analyzed structures in Twitter communities to observe various types of social rela-tions among users. They ranked users according to retweets based on PageRank. San-karanarayanan et al. [9] developed a message classification system called TwitterS-viors, and monitored the information diffusion on Twitter. Ho et al. [3] analyzed the degree of information propagation in microblogs from three aspects: number of influ-enced people, time posted, and geographic locations. 
To help users browse the huge amount of microblog messages, Weng et al. [16] developed an automatic summarization system called IMASS by analyzing Plurk messages. Yang and Kao [17] performed hot topic analysis on Plurk with modified TF-IDF weighting and association mining. While most researches investigate features in estimating influence of messages, instead of users. 
There X  X  much research effort in analyzing realtime characteristics on Twitter [6, 8, preventive warnings in realtime. Weng and Lee [15] proposed a module called ED-CoW to detect emergent events based on huge amount of realtime messages. Li et al. [6] designed a system called TEDAS to detect the importance and locations of events. In this paper, we performed hot topic detection and response opinion aggregation which combines simple structural statistics with short contents in estimating the popu-larity. We verified the effectiveness with the final result of 2012 Taiwan Presidential Election. In fact, there have been similar researches in election prediction with Twit-ter [2, 10, 14]. Most predictions are based on simple frequency counts in tweets. Gayo-Avello et al. [2] suggested that microblogs are not suitable for long-term event influenced by core political users, celebrity, and media. 
Although microblog messages are limited in length, opinion mining and sentiment analysis techniques have been applied to microblogs [12, 13]. Sun et al. [12] utilized opinion lexicon and machine learning methods to classify messages. Tang and Chen [13] used support vector machines for sentiment classification, and verified the effec-tiveness of non-linguistic features when combined with pure linguistic features. Pak and Paroubek [7] performed sentiment analysis on Twitter using Na X ve Bayes (NB) classification on frequencies of adjectives. In this paper, we applied NB classification to classify popular messages by influence scores. By matching opinion terms in mi-croblog responses with two opinion lexicons NTUSD [4] and HowNet [1], we aggre-gate user opinion orientations on popular topics. There are three major modules in the proposed approach: message influence estima-tion, hot topic identification, and response opinion aggregation. 
As shown in Fig. 1, microblog messages as well as responses such as replies, for-wards, and likes are first crawled since there X  X  no service readily available for retriev-ing microblogs during any given period of time. Standard stopword removal and Chinese word segmentation are then conducted, which are not the main focus of this paper. Next, message influence estimation module calculates an influence score based on the structural and content features of each message. Then, daily hot topics are from responses of popular messages. 3.1 Message Influence Estimation user propagation and influence persistence . The most important characteristic of mi-croblogging is to allow user participation in any public message, including replies to give comments and likes to give recommendations. Given a short message m , the degree of user participation is defined as follows: Microblog users are also allowed to forward the messages and embed a link to exter-nal pages. These actions are defined as user propagation since they allow more chances for the message to be exposed to the public. The degree of user propagation can be similarly defined as follows: Each message might have varying impact strengths depending on how long it has been posted and responded. By measuring the time duration  X  t(m) between the last response of a message m and the time it was initially posted, we can estimate its influ-ence persistence weight as follows: creases . The range of w pers is between (1, 2) so that the maximum weight is twice the lated as follows: where  X  is the weight for user propagation, with the value between 0 and 1. The idea is that: the message with more replies, forwards, likes , and URIs in a longer time pe-riod has higher influence. 3.2 Hot Topic Identification To identify hot topics from short texts, we use the estimated influence score to classi-fy messages into two categories: popular and personal. Since personal messages are volved in the communication loop. Thus, hot topics are assumed to come from higher influence messages with more participation and propagation among communities. Since people usually care about the latest events on a daily basis, we modified the that occur more often on a particular day than other days are assumed to be more representative of the events on that day. The TF-IDayF weight W ij is defined as: number of days that contain term t i , while N day is the total number of days in the col-lection. Finally, the top-ranked k terms with the highest TF-IDayF weights are se-lected as the hot topics for day j . 3.3 Response Opinion Aggregation Since microblog user opinionss are usually expressed by responding to a message, instead of directly analyzing opinions in the message, we accumulate the opinion tered as D q . For each day n , the hot topics are represented in a term vector  X  n and the cosine similarity between each message d j in D q and  X  n is then calculated to verify the relevance. Finally, the top-ranked messages d j are used as the query-relevant popular messages M q (day n ) . For each popular message m , we retrieve the corresponding set of responses Res(m) for opinion aggregation. Each response will be assigned an integer score be-response is matched against the positive and negative opinion terms in the opinion lexicons. Here we simply consider the relative number of positive and negative opi-nion terms in calculating the opinion score of message m as: number of positive and negative opinion terms in response r , respectively. The idea is that: we only need to accumulate the  X  X et X  opinion orientation from responses of mes-sage m to reflect its overall rating. For huge number of responses, this can be calcu-lated in an efficient way. 
Since the opinion score OS(m) cannot reflect the relative opinion strengths in res-ponses, we further take its influence score IS(m) into account as follows: score of message m . If the message has higher influence scores, the corresponding opinions are more likely to generate more profound influences. Although there X  X  standard microblogging dataset such as Tweets2011 5 , the duration is limited to two weeks (Jan. 23-Feb. 8, 2011). Thus, Plurk API was used for collecting test data. First, we collected a list of core users including the top-100 officially autho-rized political users and 10 media users on Plurk. Then, additional 1,640 general users 2011/10/01 to 2012/01/14, about 350,000 messages and 2,800,000 responses are col-lected as the raw data. For preprocessing, we used Yahoo Content Analysis API 6 for Chinese word segmentation, and removed meaningless symbols and stop words. Also, Plurk spam such as messages automatically generated by robot accounts, and non-content messages with no text content are filtered. Finally, the remaining 324, 512 plurks and 1,863,890 replies are stored as our dataset. 
To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we conducted two sets of experiments. First, we applied NB classification to classify popular messages by in-fluence score. Second, we aggregated opinions on hot topics related to the 2012 Tai-wan Presidential Election, and compared with the final election result. 4.1 Experiment on Influence Estimation for Message Popularity To evaluate the performance of our proposed influence model, we use the influence score as a threshold to classify messages into popular and personal categories, respec-tively. The results are evaluated in terms of precision, recall and F-measure. We take the baseline as follows: messages posted by news media and celebrity users are as-sumed to be popular; while messages without any response are assumed to be person-al. From the distribution of influence scores for our dataset, more than 80% of plurks have influence scores of less than 1. This shows an unbalanced distribution, which might greatly bias the classification results. Here, we use simple random sampling to randomly down-sample the larger set to make a balanced distribution. In evaluating experimental results are shown as follows: 
As shown in Fig. 2, we can find that precision and F-measure of popular category both increase as  X  decreases in different thresholds. This shows higher impact for user participation on the message popularity than user propagation. Comparing with the precision of 0.59 and the F-measure of 0.714 for the baseline, our method obtains the best F-measure of 0.86 when  X  =0.25 and threshold=0.2. This shows that popular mes-sages can be more accurately obtained by choosing suitable thresholds for influence scores than simply watching the updates from media or celebrity users. 4.2 Experiment on Opinion Aggregation To evaluate the performance of our proposed opinion aggregation approach, we use the candidates in 2012 Taiwan Presidential Election as our major queries, which cor-respond to the three major political parties in Taiwan: Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Kuomintang (KMT), and People First Party (PFP). Then, the corresponding relevant messages and responses are collected, as shown in Table 1. 
On each day, the top-10 hot topics are identified, and the aggregated opinions of corresponding responses are evaluated by the final election result in terms of mean average error (MAE) and accuracy as follows: We compared the accuracy of our proposed method with the nation-wide public opinion polling by several media and organizations 7 and the Web predictions such as xfuture ( X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X , as denoted by FuturePre) 8 and Plurk  X  X lection Campaign Soapbox X  ( X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X , as denoted by PlurkPre) 9 . Since we observed high variations in the weekly scores of aggregated opinions as compared with PlurkPre and FuturePre, this shows a rather unstable nature in short-term opinion aggregation on microblogs. Thus, we calculated the accumulated accuracy as in Fig. 3. 
Note that OS_PN and OIS_PN scores are calculated as in Eqs.(6) and (7) except that only nouns and proper nouns are considered in hot topics. As shown in Fig. 4, all scores gradually become stable as messa ges accumulate, and OIS outperforms other scores in the long run. Finally, we checked the performance for the last public opinion polling before presidential election on Jan. 2, 2012. Note that the undecided opinions in public opinion polling are ignored in our comparison, with the remaining percen-tages normalized to make the total 100%. 
As shown in Table 2, the proposed opinion influence score (OIS) obtains the best accuracy of 98.74%, which is higher than the accuracy by TVBS (97.3%) among all public opinion polling predictions from major media. This verifies the effectiveness of our proposed approach in estimating the overall opinion orientations from micro-blog responses. Although the proposed method is simple, our experimental results showed a high accuracy in the aggregated opinions. This shows the effectiveness of the proposed opinion aggregation approach by accumulated orientations from responses of popular messages for hot topics. 
From our observation, a relatively low percentage of relevant messages and res-ponses are classified as popular. This is due to the fewer number of query terms in hot topic detection as shown in Table 1. Specifically, the relevant messages and responses are collected by the names of candidates and parties, as used in news reports and edi-torials. However, informal terms such as abbreviations and nicknames are more common in social media. For exam ple, instead of Ma Ying-jeou (  X  X  X  X  ) and Tsai Ing-wen (  X  X  X  X  ) in microblogs, nicknames (such as  X   X  X  X   X  and  X   X  X  X   X ) or even the last name Ma ( X   X   X ) and Tsai ( X   X   X ) might be rather used. The issues of abbreviations and nicknames for personal name disambiguation would be further investigated in future work. In this paper, we have proposed an opinion aggregation approach based on message influence and hot topic detection for microblogs. Our approach is novel in opinion aggregation from microblog responses. Empirical evaluations on Plurk showed a very high accuracy of 98.74% in the case of the 2012 Taiwan Presidential Election. Further investigation on the effectiveness for detecting other types of events is needed. Acknowledgement.
