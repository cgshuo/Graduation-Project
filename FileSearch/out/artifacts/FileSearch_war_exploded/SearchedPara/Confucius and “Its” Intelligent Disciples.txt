Confucius is the product code name of Google X  X  Knowledge Search product, which is making these algorithms run even faster on thousands of machines, and some open research problems will also be presented. learning: concept learning, parallel algorithms. General Terms: Algorithms, Performance, Experimentation. Edward Chang directs Google Research in China since Marc h 2006. He joined the department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering at University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1999 after receiving his PhD from Stanford University. Ed received his tenure in 2003, and was promoted to full professor of Electrical applications to rich-media data ma nagement and social-network collabor ative filtering. His research group recently parallelized SVMs [1], PLSA [2], Frequent-itemset Mining [3], Spectral Clustering [4], and LDA [5] to run on distributed machines for mining large-scale datasets. Ed has served on ACM, VLDB, IEEE, WWW, and SIAM conference program committees, and co-cha ired several conferences including MMM, ACM MM, ICDE, and WWW. Ed is a recipient of the IBM Faculty Partnership Award and the NSF Career Award. [1] E.Y. Chang, K. Zhu, H. Wang, H. Bai, J. Li, Z. Qiu, H.
