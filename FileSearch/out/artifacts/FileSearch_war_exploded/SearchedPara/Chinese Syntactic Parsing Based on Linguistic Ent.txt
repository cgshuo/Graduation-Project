 In this paper, we present a new parsing method for Chinese based on a newly proposed linguistic entity relationship model. In the model, we extract and define the linguistic entity relationship modes to describe the most basic syntactic and semantic structures of Chinese, and use the relationship modes as the foundation to implement the parsing algorithm. Compared with the rule-based and corpus -based methods, we neither manually write a large number of rules as used in traditional rule-based methods nor use the corpus to train the model. We only use the few meta-rules t o describe the grammars in the parsing procedure . The system performance of syntactic parsing based on the model outperforms the corpus-based baseline system.

Syntactic parsing, the task of identifying syntactic components modifier, and complement , is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing. Many natural language applications such as machine translation and question answering would benefit from, or even require, high accuracy syntactic parser . Syntactic parsing is a difficult issue for many languages, especially for Chinese. Parsing Chinese has more challenges and difficulties comparing to parsing other languages [1, 2]. Many rule-based and corpus-based methods have been proposed for the Chinese syntactic parsing. The rule-based methods need a large number of generation rules that are often manually edited by developers, and the corpus-based methods need a large-scale corpus to train the linguistic model. 
In the rule-based methods, developers need manually write plenty of generation rules, which comprise not only many universal rules but also more specific rules. These systems have proved their abilities and effects, but they commonly have some problems , such as exponential expansion of generation rules , redundancy of generation rules and conflict of different generation rules . For avoiding these problems developers must use automatic, semi-automatic or manual methods to optimize the rule base [3-5]. However, these problems are difficult to be resolved completely. 
In the corpus-based methods, developers need large-scale and high quality corpus to train language models. However, the effects of these systems are easily influenced by some characteristics of corpus, such as the quantity, quality, domain and distribution. The domain adaptability of these systems is often inferior to the rule-based systems. Especially in open domains, the effects of these systems decrease obviously [6]. Furthermore these systems are not very effective in analyzing recursively the sentence; that is to say, compared with rule-based systems their ability of recursive dependency structures composed by nested syntactic components [7]. 
At present, all the above problems with the rule-based and corpus -based methods are not effectively resolved. For overcoming these problems and avoiding the laborious, costly and time-consuming work of editing the rules and building the corpus, we propose a new model that is called Linguistic Entity Relationship Model (LERM) to parse the Chinese sentence [8]. In the model, we only use the few meta-rules to describe the grammars and parse the sentence, and w e need no corpus to train the model. Furthermore, since Chinese poses some unique problems for the development of parser [1, 2] , in the model we fully consider and use some Chinese syntactic and semantic features, which are to some extent language-specific but very effective. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly provides some basic definitions of the lingu istic entity relationship model. Section 3 describes the implementation algorithm of the Chinese syntactic parsing based on the proposed model. Section 4 gives the experimental results. Finally, Section 5 concludes with a discussion of this work and future task. 
Entity and relationship are fundamental concept in ontology research. In this paper, by using the concept and definition for reference, we extend the predicate-argument structure in linguistics into entity-relationship model, which is used for describing the interaction of linguistic entities. In the Linguistic Entity Relationship Model (LERM), we generalize and build the basic relationship modes by objectively summarizing and abstracting the Chinese grammars, and we use the modes as the foundation of the Chinese syntactic parsing. 
Linguistic entity, which can be a word, phrase or sentence, is defined as a structural unit of being used for constructing relationship modes of linguistic entities, and it is a structural constituent of a sentence. The basic relationship modes of linguistic entities, which are used for the algorithm of analysis and verification of relationship modes, are extracted and generalized from the Chinese corpus with the help of Chinese grammar dictionary, and therefore they can be used to describe the most basic grammatical and semantic logic of Chinese sentence. 
Generally, the relationship modes of linguistic entities are lexicalized and built on the verb, and they can describe the syntactic and semantic structure of a sentence, such as the relationship of predicate and argument. Furthermore, the relationship modes can also be built on the adjective in adjective-predicate sentence, or on the noun in noun-predicate sentence. In this paper we only present the relationship modes that are built on the verb because they are the most important and complex relationship modes compared with the others. 
LERM has five types of most basic relationships , and each type of relationship includes some relationship modes . They are described in detail in Table 1. The relationship G denotes the subject-verb-object (SVO) or subject-verb (SV) sentence; D denotes the double-object sentence ; C denotes the causative or imperative sentence ; L includes but no limited  X   X   X  sentence ; E includes but no lim ited  X   X   X  sentence (i.e., sentence of being or existential sentence) . In the relationship modes, entity a , b , c or s is the argument. In particular, s is a special entity of being a subsentence, which presents the recursive nature of natural language. The relationship G , D , C , L or E is the predicate and is often built on the verb. However, in some special Chinese sentence, such as the adjective-predicate sentence whose relationship is G , the predicate is adjective, and the relationship modes of G only include aG and sG . 
The relationship modes are lexicalized for being built on the verb. They are semiautomatically extracted, manually edited, and stored in the linguistic entity relationship dictionary. For example, some relationship modes built on the verb  X   X   X  are described and the conceptual constraints of entities are given in Table 2. 
We define the Chinese sentence CS as CS=W 1 W 2 ... W where CS totally contains N Chinese words and W i Chinese word , and define the POS tag of the word W the POS tag WP i is verb, we define the meaning set of WP contains m meanings as WPM={WPM 1 , ... , WP M i , ... , WPM define the relationship mode set of the meaning WP M contains r relationship modes as WPMR={WPMR 1 , ... , WP MR i , ... , WPMR r } . The above knowledge of POS tags, meanings and relationship modes is stored in the linguistic entity relationship dictionary, and will be used as the input parameters of the procedure of complete analysis and verification of relationship modes. 
In the parsing algorithm described in algorithm 1, we analyze and verify whether each input sentence is any one of the five Chinese sentence patterns that are listed in function Parsing() . For example, in the procedure of VerbalPredicateSentence() , the relationship modes are built on the verb, so each relationship mode of the verb of the input sentence is analyzed and verified . After being verified, the mode that is approved to be reasonable and correct can be used to describe the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentence. Each relationship mode has the corresponding analysis and verification action set ( RMAVActionSet ), which is listed in Tabl e 1. The action expression F(X) and F(Y) in RMAVActionSet are recursively defined as the few meta-rules, which are formally similar to the generation rules of Context-Free G rammar (CFG). The few meta-rules are used for recursively parsing the subsequence X and Y of CS . In the following subsection, we will give a definition of meta-rules as well as some examples.

In traditional rule-based systems, language experts need to write a large number of language rules that are usually defined and described in the form of rule primitives by system developers [4, 5]. For avoiding the laborious, costly and time-consuming work, we only use the few meta-rules to describe Chinese grammars and need no language experts. Meta-rules, though limited are efficient and effective. They are manually constructed and in small amounts, and they are used for parsing Chinese sentence, which is given according to golden standard (namely with word tokens and POS tags). They conform to the uniform specification of multiple-valued recursive function of words [9]. 
In this paper, we assume familiarity with the basic idea of recursive function theory [9] and define the multiple-va lued recursive function of words as  X  denotes the empty word and FALSE denotes f(x) is undefined function . The decomposition function g i (x) is used for decomposing and parsing the string x , and it is defined as g (x)=h 1 (x 1 )+h 2 (x 2 )+...+h j (x j )+ ... +h m (x m ) (x= x of words and at least one function h j (x j ) among these m functions composed of m substrings and x j is the j -th substring; + is used for concatenating result string of each function h j (x substring x j maybe be composed of one or more than one word and therefore m is less than or equal to | x| . 
The multiple-valued recursive function of words is a kind of multiple-valued function of words and used for defining and describing meta-rules of parsing Chinese sentence. 
In this subsection we give some examples of meta-rules expressions. The following four meta-rules are most basic and important for building the analysis and verification action set ( RMAVActionSet:{F(X),F(Y)} ). e

X  , which contain s all Chinese conjuctions; [] denotes its inner parameter is an alternative substring ; M(x ) is used for defining modifier of a headword ; P(x) is used for defining prepositional phrase; AdvP(x) is us ed for defining a dverbia ls that are usually adverbs, adverb ph rases, or prepositional phrases ; CMP(x) is used for defining complement . view of limited space , and we can simila rly construct other unlisted meta -rules , i.e., M(x ) , P(x) , AdvP(x) and CMP(x) , according to the definition of multiple-valued recursive function of words. 
Given a Chinese sentence  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X  and it s word tokens and POS tags  X   X  X  X  _NN  X  X  X  _NN  X  X  X  _NN  X  X  X  _VV  X  X  _NR  X  X  X  _NN  X  X  _JJ  X  X  X  X  _NN  X  , the parsing result can be presented as a tree as illustrated in Figure 1. It can also be automatically transformed to Penn Chinese Treebank style that i s illustrated in Figure 2.

Since the corpus-based system MaltParser [ 10 ] recently shows almost state-of -the-art performance on multilingual dependency parsing tasks in comparison to the other approaches, we use it as the baseline system of Chinese parsing. We select the top 1000 sentences from Penn Chinese Treebank 5.1 to build the test dataset and use the remaining sentences as the training dataset for the MaltParser. We use the method [11] to convert the phrase structure of the sentence into dependency structure. All sentences are input according to golden standard, i.e., with word tokens and POS tags. 
Table 3 . Syntax Test . ( Labeled precision is percentage of non-root words assigned correct ly heads and dependency labels; root complete precision is percentage of complete ly matched sentence . MaltParser 82.97 70.63 30.56 The experimental results listed in Table 3 shows that the system LERM gets the better performance. Especially the labeled and root accuracy are encouraging. Since the parsing entry of LERM is the verb that is often the root node of most sentences, the parsing procedure of LERM can take the global syntactic and semantic features into account. This ensures that the verb and its arguments are adequately analyzed and verified. As a result, the root accuracy of system LERM is remarkably higher than the baseline system , and this also benefit the improvement of the labeled accuracy. 
In order to parse the Chinese sentence, we propose the linguistic entity relationship model and design the concise and effective algorithm based on the model. Although we neither use production rules to describe the syntactic and semantic structures nor use the corpus to train our system, we get the encouraging performance and avoid the problems with rule-based or corpus-based systems. The experimental results show that the model and algorithm are feasible and effective. In this paper, we emphasize particularly on the basic definitions of the model and analytic procedure, and we will describe in detail the simply mentioned parts in another paper, i.e., the adjective-predicate, noun-predicate, consecutive-verb and composite sentence pattern.
