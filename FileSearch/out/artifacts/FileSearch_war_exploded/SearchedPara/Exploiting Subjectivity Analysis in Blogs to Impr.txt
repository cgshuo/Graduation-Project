 In this paper, we address a relatively new and interesting text categorization problem: classify a political blog as ei-ther liberal or conservative , based on its political leaning. Our subjectivity analysis based method is twofold: 1) we identify subjective sentences that contain at least two strong subjective clues based on the General Inquirer dictionary; 2) from subjective sentences identified, we extract opinion expressions and other features to build political leaning clas-sifiers. Experimental results with a political blog corpus we built show that by using features from subjective sentences can significantly improve the classification performance. In addition, by extracting opinion expressions from subjective sentences, we are able to reveal opinions that are character-istic of a specific political leaning to some extent.

As more political blogs go online, it is both interesting and useful to locate the bloggers X  positions along the political leaning continuum, from liberal to conservative.

Though text categorization has been heavily researched, previous work on political blog categorization in terms of political leanings has been limited. It is known that po-litical blogs are highly opinionated and rich in subjective languages. Intuitively, it is bloggers X  different opinions on common issues that mark a border between liberal blogs and conservative ones. This makes the political leaning categorization both different from and more difficult than traditional text categorization applications that have been researched. Therefore, it has motivated us to explore sub-jectivity manifested in political blogs and use subjectivity information thus found in building political leaning classi-fiers. The work reported here is the extension of our previous one on the same problem, which used all texts in liberal and conservative blogs with  X  X ag of Words X  (BoW) and some link features [1]. In the following, we will first describe our corpus, and then discuss our methods and experiments.
Our corpus contains front pages of 1,054 liberal blogs and 793 conservative blogs, totalling more than 200MB. URLs of these blogs were obtained from five blog catalog web sites. All these blogs are written in English. In addition, the cor-pus contains no duplicate blog and no blog is labeled as both liberal and conservative.

In the past, Support Vector Machine learning algorithm (SVM) has been successfully used in text categorization. In this paper, we report on resu lts using classification in Joachims X  SV M light implementation of SVM 1 . All results reported in this paper were obtained by using SV M light with linear kernels in a 10-fold cross-validation by setting  X  X ost-factor X  to 0.75 (  X  793 1054 ) to balance the cost of  X  X alse positive X  2 error and the cost of  X  X alse negative X  3 error.
We use the standard precision and recal l to evaluate pre-diction of each category. We also calculate F 1measureas overall accuracy as the number of correctly classified blogs of both categories divided by the total number of blogs to be classified. Lastly, average F 1 measure is calculated as the average of summation of F 1 of each category classification. In the following, L P, L R, L F1, R P, R R, and R F1 de-note precision, recall and F1 of liberal and conservative blog prediction respectively.
We use a rule-based subjective classifier to separate sub-jective sentences from objective ones. The rule of the clas-sifier is simple: if a sentence contains at least two strong subjective clues, it is classified as subjective. To look for strong subjective clues, we chose the General Inquirer dic-tionary 4 (GI) due to its abundant semantic categories. For our purpose, we chose the following nine categories, includ-ing,  X  X trong X ,  X  X ostile X ,  X  X leasur X ,  X  X ain X ,  X  X eel X ,  X  X rousal X , http://svmlight.joachims.org/
Conservative blogs are classified as  X  X iberal X .
Liberal blogs are classified as  X  X onservative X . http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/  X  inquirer/  X  X MOT X ,  X  X irtue X  and  X  X ice X . Thus, all words belonging to any of these nine categories are considered as strong subjec-tive clues. In total, there are 4004 different entries (an entry is a word sense) in GI that appear on our strong subjective clue list.

The subjective classifier works as follows. First, we extract only text from the HTML file of a blog. Then the text is split into sentences after which part-of-speech (POS) tagging is applied to each sentence and each word is reduced to its base form. Next, each POS-tagged word is assigned to all categories of the same word with the same POS in GI if found. If a word belongs to at least one of the nine categories as mentioned, it is deemed as a strong subjective clue .Last, if a sentence contains at least two such clue words, it is classified as subjective .Otherwise,itis objective .
By applying the subjective classifier to both liberal and conservative blogs in our corpus, around 63% sentences in total were classified as subjective .Toevaluatethesubjective classifier, we compared results of a political leaning classifier by using BoW from these subjective sentences to those with-out exclusively using them. Table 1 shows the results, where  X  all BoW  X  denotes a classifier using all texts,  X  GIsubj the classifier using only subjective sentences,  X  GIobj using only objective ones, and  X  rand 63 BoW  X  using 63% of all sentences that are randomly selected. In addition, the column  X  X ize X  indicates percentage of all sentences used in experiments. We can see that  X  GIsubj BoW  X  X chievesthe best performance among these classifiers and it outperforms  X  all BoW  X  on overall accuracy by 1.66% ( p&lt; 0 . 005).
In our work, a valid opinion expression should: 1) describe subjectivity information; 2) contain at least a noun with at least a verb or with at least an adjective, optionally with ad-verbs as their modifiers, optionally with category  X  X ositiv X  or  X  X egativ X  to indicate an Orientation value, and option-ally with  X  X egate X  to indicate a  X  X arked X  Polarity . X  X ositiv X ,  X  X egativ X  and  X  X egate X  are three GI categories. To meet the first requirement, we restrict opinion expression extraction only in subjective sentences. A sentence is  X  X ositiv X  if it contains at least a  X  X ositiv X  word but without a  X  X egativ X  one. Similarly, a sentence with at least a  X  X egativ X  word but with no  X  X ositiv X  one is labeled  X  X egativ X . In other cases, no Orientation label is assigned. We also assign  X  X egate X  to a sentence if it contains odd number of occurrences of words in  X  X egate X  category in GI.

To extract opinion expressions, subjective sentences in lib-eral blogs and in conservative ones are separately processed. For each sentence, list all nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs,  X  X ositiv X ,  X  X egativ X  and  X  X egate X  as a transaction record. Af-ter all sentences are processed, we apply Apriori algorithm to find maximum itemsets with the following settings: 1) the minimum support threshold is set to such a value that a fre-quent itemset should appear at least once in every 10 blogs; 2) the maximum support threshold is set so that frequent itemsets appearing at least once per blog are discarded; 3) each maximum itemset should contain less than six items. Last, among all the maximum itemsets found, those meeting the above conditions are kept as opinion expressions. In this way, two lists of opinion expressions are obtained, one from liberal blogs and the other from conservative ones. Then the two lists are merged into one by joining on the same opinion expressions.

On the list of opinion expressions, we can query with nouns on interesting political issues to find opinions on them; we can also query with verbs to find political issues or en-tities  X  X nfluenced X  by these verbs. For example, by search-ing for  X  X mmigr X  ( X  X mmigration X  or  X  X mmigrant X  stemmed by Porter stemmer), we obtained  X  X llegal immigration Negativ X  (181 times in conservative blogs but 55 times in liberal ones). By searching for  X  X ut X , we found  X  X ut tax X , which was equally frequently used by both liberal and conservative bloggers. More interestingly, Table 2 shows top five  X  X ositiv X ,  X  X ega-tiv X  and  X  X egate X  opinion expressions, grouped by  X  X iberal X  and  X  X onservative X .

Lastly, by combining the opinion expression extraction process with a 10-fold cross-validation experiment, the last row in Table 1 shows the political leaning classification re-sults by using BoW and using opinion expressions as binary features (OE), denoted by  X  GIsubj BoW + GIsubj OE  X . By including opinion expressions, the classifier achieved a sta-tistically significant improvement of 2% over  X  GIsubj BoW on overall accuracy ( p&lt; 0 . 001). [1] M. Jiang and S. Argamon.
