 Yonghui Zhang, Chuan Li (  X  ) , Yanmei Li, Changjie Tang, and Ning Yang Currently, the method used to study community evolution in dynamic networks can be roughly divided into two categories. The first type of method is called independent work, and then the community detection algorithm is applied to get the community structure on each network snapshot. However, most community detection algorithms are unstable and easy to fall into local optimum, i.e., even small changes in network connection will lead to a very different community structure. Especially for agglo-merative hierarchical clustering algorithms, when a small amount of the network edges are removed, the community structure found by these algorithms will be of great change [5]. 
The second type of approach to study community evolution is evolutionary cluster-ing [6-8]. This type of method uses temporal smoothness assumption that community structure does not change dramatically in continuous timestamps. Evolutionary clus-tering method, by taking into account the temporal information in network evolution, overcomes the problem of randomness caused by the community detection algorithm or the noise of the network. However, because of the use of temporal smoothing hy-pothesis, these methods cannot capture the dramatic changes of community structure due to external events, which is a common defect to such methods. 
To solve these problems and explore the issue of community evolution better, this paper proposes a new method for mining the evolution of communities from dynamic networks. vidual community; the height of the community at this time is 0. Then each time the most two similar communities are selected and merged. In the single-link hierarchical clustering, the similarity between two communities is the similarity of the most simi-bined community. If there are multiple communities with the same similarity, then randomly select two communities to merge. The process is repeated until all the edges are combined into a community. Single-link hi erarchical clustering will get a dendro-gram shown in Fig. 1. Apply hierarchical clustering to the dynamic network, and we will get a dynamic dendrogram. 2.1 Community Screening The result of hierarchical clustering algorithm is a complete community hierarchy, which inevitably contains a large number of meaningless communities such as trivial communities and redundant communities. These communities are not only pointless rithm, and therefore they need to be removed from the collection of communities. Definition 1: trivial community . Given a community c t,i community is a trivial community. Definition 2: redundant community . Let community c same parent community c t,i , i.e. ) , ( tisfied, then community c t,j is a redundant community. 
Redundant communities refer to the communities that are very similar with other communities, and can be substituted by them. As shown in Fig. 2, in the hierarchical clustering process, community B and community C are merged into community A. It can be seen that community B, which is merely one edge and one node fewer than community A, is very similar with community A. The evolution of community B and community A will be very similar as well, so in community evolution analysis com-munity B is redundant and can be replaced with the community A. In this paper, we use Enron (the emails that sent among the employees of Enron Cor-poration) and Facebook (the comments that left by a portion of Facebook users on the Facebook wall) data set in the following experiments. 
In order to study the community size effects on the community evolution, according to communities(the number of node is less than 10), medium-scale communities(the num-ber of node is greater than 10 and less than 100) and large-scale communities(the number of the upper three figures is the mean of all the communities X  stability
As can be seen from Fig. 3, in Enron dataset, small-scale communities are most unstable while large-scale communities are most stable. There is no significant differ-ence in the standard deviation of community stability between communities of three kinds of scale. However, in Facebook dataset, the mean of community stability of small-scale communities is the highest and the standard deviation is also the highest, indicating that small-scale communities as a whole is relatively stable, and there exist many very stable communities and very unstable communities at the same time. The mean of community stability of large-scale communities is the lowest and the stan-munities is relatively close. This paper discusses the issue of new community evolution method with multiple hierarchies and proposes a stable method to enable the analysis of the community evolution. Experiments show that compared with traditional methods, our work sig-nificantly improves the algorithm performances.
