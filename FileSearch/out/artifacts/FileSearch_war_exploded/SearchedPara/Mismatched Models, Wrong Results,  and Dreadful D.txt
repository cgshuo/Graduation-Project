 Data mining techniques use  X  X core functions X  to quantify how well a model fits a given data set. Parameters are estimated by optimising the fit, as measured by the chosen score function, and model ROC curve (the AUC), and others. The first four of these require a  X  X lassification threshold X  to be chosen, a choice which may not be easy, or may even be impossibl e, especially when the classification rule is to be applied in the future. In contrast, the AUC does not require the specification of a classification threshold, but summarises performance over the range of possi ble threshold choices. However, unfortunately, and despite the widespread use of the AUC, it has a previously unrecognised fundamental incoherence lying at screening.
