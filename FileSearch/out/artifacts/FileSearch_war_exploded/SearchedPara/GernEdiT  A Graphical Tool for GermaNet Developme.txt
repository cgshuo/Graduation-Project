 The main purpose of the GermaNet Editing Tool GernEdiT tool is to support lexicographers in access ing , modify ing , and extend ing the Ge r-maNet data (Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2002; He n-rich and Hinrichs, 2010) in an easy and adaptive way and to aid in the nav i gation throu gh the GermaNet word class hiera r chies, so as to find the appropriate place in the hierarchy for new synsets (short for: syno n ymy set) and lexical units. GernEdiT replaces the traditional Ge r-maNet development based on lex i cographer files (Fel l baum, 1998) b y a more user -friendly visual tool that supports versioning and collaborative annotation by several lexicographers working in pa r allel.

Furthermore, GernEdiT facilitate s internal consistency of the GermaNet data such as appr o-priate linking of lexical units with synsets, co n necte d ness of the synset graph, and automatic closure among relations and their inverse cou n-terparts.

All these functionalities along with the main aspects of GernEdiT X  X  usage and usability are pr e sented in this paper. GermaNet is a lexical -semantic wordnet that is modeled after the Princeton WordNet for En g lish (Fellbaum, 1998). It covers the three word cat e-gories of adjectives, nouns, and verbs and part i-tions the lexical space into a set of concepts that are int erlinked by semantic relations. A s e mantic concept is modeled by a synset . A synset is a set of words (called lexical units ) where all the words are taken to have (almost) the same mea n-ing. Thus a synset is a set -representation of the semantic relation of syno n ymy, which means that it consists of a list of lexical units.
 There are two types of semantic relations in GermaNet: conceptual and lexical relations . Conce p tual relations hold between two semantic concepts, i.e. synsets. They include relations such a s hyperonymy, part -whole relations, e n-tailment, or causation. GermaNet is hierarch i-cally structured in terms of the hyperonymy rel a-tion. Lexical relations hold between two indivi d-ual lexical units. A n tonymy, a pair of opposites, is an example of a lexical rel a tion. The GermaNet Editing Tool GernEdiT provides a graphical user interface, i m plemented as a Java Swing application, which primarily allows mai n-taining the Ge r maNet data in a user -friendly way. The editor represents an inter face to a rel a-tional database , where all GermaNet data is stored from now on. 3.1 Motivation The traditional lexicographic development of GermaNet was error prone and time -consum ing, mainly du e to a complex un derlying data format and no oppo r tunity of automatic consistency checks. This is exactly why GernEdiT wa s d e-veloped : It supports lexicographers who need to a c cess, modify, and extend GermaNet data by providing these fun c tions through simpl e button -clicks, searches, and form editing. There are se v-eral ways to search data and browse through the GermaNet graph. These functionalities allow lexicogr a phers, among other things, to find the appropriate place in the hierarchy for the inse r-tion of ne w synsets and lexical units. Last but not least , GernEdiT facilitate s internal consi s tency and correctness of the linguistic resource and su p ports versioning and collaborative annotation of GermaNet by several lexico g raphers working in parallel . 3.2 The Main User Interface Figure 1 illustrates the main user panel of Ger n-EdiT. It shows a Search panel above, two panels for Synsets and Lexical Units in the middle, and four tabs below: a Conceptual Rel a tions Editor , a Graph with Hyperonyms and Hyponyms , a Lex i -cal Relations Editor , and an Exa m ples and Frames tab.

In Figure 1 , a search for synsets consisting of lexical units with the word Nuss ( G erman noun for: nut ) has been executed. Accordingly, the Synset s panel displays the three resulting synsets that matc h the search item. The Synset Id is the unique database ID that unambiguously ident i-fies a synset, and which can also be used to search for exactly that synset. Word Category specifies whether a sy n set is an adjective ( adj ), a noun ( nomen ), or a verb ( ve r ben ), whereas Word Class classifies the synsets into semantic fields. The word class of the selected synset in Figure 1 is Nahrung (German noun for: food ). The Par a-phrase column contains a description of a synset, e.g., for the selected synset the par a phrase is: der essbare Kern einer Nuss (German phrase for: the edible kernel of a nut ). The co l umn All Orth Forms simp ly lists all orthographical var i ants of all its lexical units.
 Which lexical units are listed in the Lexical Units panel depends on the selected synset in the Sy n set s panel. Here, Lex Unit Id and Synset Id again reflect the corresponding unique dat a base ID s. Orth Form (short for: orthographic form ) represents the correct spelling of a word accor d-ing to the rules of the spelling reform Neue Deutsche Rechtschreibung (Rat f X r deutsche Rechtschreibung, 2006), a r e cently adopted spel l ing reform. In our example, the main orth o-graphic form is Nuss . Orth Var may contain an alternative spelling that is admissible accor d ing to the Neue Deutsche Rechtschreibung . 1 Old Orth Form represents the main orthographic form prior to the Neue Deutsche Rech t-schreibung . This means that Nu X  was the correct spelling instead of Nuss before the German spel l-ing reform. Old Orth Var contains any accepted variant prior to the Neue Deutsche Rech t-schreibung . The Old Orth Var field is filled only if it is no longer a l lowed in the new orthogra phy.
The Boolean values Named Entity , Artificial , and Style Marking express further properties of a lex i cal unit, whether the lexical unit is a named en tity, an artificial concept node, or a stylistic variant.

For both the lexical units and the synsets, th ere are two buttons Use as From and Use as To , which help to add new relations (see the explan a-tion of Figure 3 in section 3.6 below which e x-plains the creation of new rel a tions). 3.3 Search Functionalities It is possible to search for words or synset dat a-base IDs via the search panel (see Figure 1 at the top). The check box Ignore Case offers the po s-sibility o f searching without distinguishing b e-tween u p per and lower case.
Via the file menu, lists of all synsets or lexical units with their properties can be a c cessed. To these lists, very detailed filters can be applied: e.g., filtering the lexical units or syns ets by parts of their orth o graphical forms. Figure 2 shows a list of lexical units to which a detailed filter has been applied: verbs have been chosen (see the chosen tab) whose orthograph i cal forms start with an a -(see starts wi th check box and corr e-sponding text field) and end with the suffix -ten (see end s with check box and corresponding text field). Only verbs that have a frame that contains NN are chosen (see Frame co n tains check box and corr e sponding text field). Furthermor e, the resulting filtered list is sorted in descending o r-der by their examples (see the little triangle in the Examples header of the result table). The number in the brackets behind the word category in the tab title indicates the count of the filtered le xical units (in this example 193 verbs pass the fi l ter). 3.4 Visualization of the Graph Hie r archy There is the possibility to display a graph with all hyperonyms and hyponyms of a selected sy n set. This is shown in the bottom half of Figure 1 in the tab Graph with Hyperonyms and Hyp o nyms . The graph in Figure 1 visualizes a part of the h i-erarchical structure of GermaNet centered around the sy n set containing Nuss and displays the hyperonyms and hyponyms of this s ynset up to a certain para m eterized depth (in this case depth 2 has been chosen). The Hyperonym Depth chooser allows unfolding the graph to the top up to the preselected depth. As it is not possible to visualize the whole Ge r maNet contents at once, the gra ph can be seen as a window to Ge r maNet. A click on any synset node within the graph, navigates to that synset. This functionality su p-ports lexico g raphers especially in finding the appropriate place in the hierarchy for the inse r-tion of new synsets. 3.5 Modific ations of Existing Items If the lexicographers X  task is to modify existing synsets or lexical units, this is done by selecting a sy n set or lexical unit displayed in the Synsets and the Lex i cal Units panels shown in Figure 1 . The p roperties of such selected items can be e d-ited by a click in the corresponding table cell. For exa m ple by clicking in the cell Orth Form the spelling of a lexical unit can be corrected in case of an earlier typo was made.

If lexicographers want to edit exa mples, frames, conceptual, or lexical relations this is done by choosing the appropriate tab ind i cated at the bottom of Figure 1 . By clicking one of these tabs, the corr e sponding panel appears below these tabs. In Figure 1 the panel for Gr aph with Hyperonyms and Hyponyms is di s played.

It is po s sible to edit the examples and frames associated with a lexical unit via the E x amples and Frames tab. Frames specify the synta c tic valence of a lexical unit. Each fr ame can have an associated example that indicates a possible u s-age of the lexical unit for that particular frame. The tab Examples and Frames is thus partic u-larly geared towards the editing of verb e n tries. By clicking on the tab all examples and frames of a lexical unit are listed and can then be mod i-fied by choosing the a p propriate editing buttons. For more information about these editing fun c-tions see Henrich and Hinrichs (2010). 3.6 Editing of Relations If lexicographers want to add new conce p tual or lexical rel a tions to a synset or a lexical unit this is done by clicking on the Conceptual Rel a tions Editor or the Lexical Rel a tions Editor shown in Figure 1 .
 Figure 3 shows the panel that appears if the Conceptual Relations Editor has been ch o sen for the synset containing Nuss . To create a new rel a-tion, the lexicographer needs to use the bu t tons Use as From and Use as To shown in Figure 1 . This will insert the ID of the selected synsets from the Synsets panel in the corresponding From or To field in Figure 3 . The button Delete ConRel allows deletion of a co n ceptual relation, if all consi s tency checks are passed.

The Lexical Relations Editor tab supports edi t-ing all lexical relations. It is not displayed sep a-rately for re a sons of space, but it is analogue to the Conce p tual Relations Editor tab for editing conceptual r el a tions. 3.7 Adding Synsets and Lexical Units The buttons Add New Hyponym and Add New LexUnit in the Synsets panel (see Figure 1 ) can be used to i n sert a new synset or lexical unit at the selected place in the GermaNet graph, and the buttons D e lete Synset and Delete LexUnit remove the selected entry, r e spectively.

The Synset Editor in Figure 4 (on the left) shows the window which appears after a click on Add New Hyponym . When clicking on the button Create Sy n set , the Lexical Unit Editor (shown in Figure 4 , right) pops up. This workflow forces the parallel creation of a lexical unit while crea t-ing a synset. 3.8 Consistency Checks GernEdiT facilitates internal consistency of the GermaNet da ta. This is a chieved by the workflow -oriented design of the editor. It is not possible to create a synset without creating a lexical unit in parallel (as described in section 3.7 ). Furthe r more, it is not possible to insert a ne w synset without specifying the place in the GermaNet hiera r chy where the new synset should be added. This is achieved by the button Add New Hyp o nym ( see Figure 1 ) which forces the user to ide n tify the appropriate hyperonym for th e new sy n set to be added. Furthermore, it is not possible to insert a lexical unit without spec i-fying the corr e sponding synset. On deletion of a synset, all corresponding data such as conce p tual relations, lexical units with their lexical relations, frames , and examples, are deleted automatically.
Consistency checks also take effect for the t a-ble cell editing in the Synsets and Lexical Units panels of the main user i n terface (see Figure 1 ), e.g., the main orthographic form of a lex i cal unit may never be empty.

All buttons in GernEdiT are enabled only if the corresponding functionalities meet the co n-sistency requir e ments, e.g., if a synset consists only of one lexical unit, it is not possible to d e-lete that lexical unit and thus the button Delete LexUnit is disabled. Also, if the deletion of a synset or a relation would violate the complete connectedness of the GermaNet graph, it is not possible to delete that sy n set. 3.9 Further Functionalities There are further functionalities available through the file menu. Besides retrieving the up -to -date statistics of GermaNet, an editing history makes it possible to list all modific a tions on the GermaNet data, with the inform a tion about who made the change and how the modified item looked b e fore.

G ernEdiT supports various export functional i-ties. For example, it is possible to e x port all GermaNet contents into XML files, which are used as an exchange format of Ge r maNet, or to export a list of all verbs with their corresponding frames and examples. In order to assess the usefulness of GernEdiT, we conducted in depth interviews with the Germ a-Net lexicographers and with the senior researcher who oversees all lexicographic deve l opment. At the time of the interview all of these researche r s had worked with the tool for about eight months. The present section summarizes the feedback about GernEdiT that was obtained in this way.

The initial learning curve for getting familiar with GernEdiT is considerably lower compared to the learning curve re quired for the traditional development based on lexicogr a pher files. Moreover, t he GermaNet development with GernEdiT is both more efficient and accurate compared to the tr a ditional development along the following dimensions:
In sum, the lexicographers of GermaNet gave very positive feedback about the use of Ger n-EdiT and also made smaller suggestions for i m-proving its u ser -friendliness further . This unde r-scores the utility of GernEdiT from a pra c tical point of view . In this paper we have described the functiona l ity of GernEdiT. The extremely positive feedback of the GermaNet lexicographers unde rscores the practical benefits gained by using the GernEdiT tool in practice.

At the moment, GernEdiT is customized for maintaining the GermaNet data. In future work, we plan to adapt the tool so that it can be used with wordnets for other languages as wel l. This would mean that the wordnet data for a given language would have to be stored in a relational database and that the tool itself can handle the language specific data structures of the wordnet in question.
 We would like to thank all GermaNet lexicogr a-phers for their willingness to experiment with GernEdiT and to be interviewed about their e x-periences with the tool.

Special thanks go to Reinhild Barkey for her valuable input on both the features and user -friendliness of GernEdiT and t o Alexander Ki s-lev for his contributions to the underlying dat a-base format.
