 In this paper, we present a systematic perspective study on choosing and evaluating the initial seed items that will be recommended to the cold start users. We first construct an item consumption correlation network to capture the exist-ing users X  general consumption behaviors. Then, we formal-ize initial items recommendation as the influential seed set selection problem. Along this line, we present several meth-ods, each of which selects seed items according to different rules. Finally, the experimental results on two real-world data sets verify that with different seed items, the users X  consumption numbers will be quite different. Meanwhile, the results also provide many deep insights into these selec-tion methods and their recommended seed items.
 H.2.8 [ Database Management ]: Database Applications X  Data Mining Algorithms, Experimentation Seed Items, Item Network, Influential, Popularity
Whenever a fresh user comes, there is no or few personal information available, thus how to make recommendations for these cold start users becomes a huge and urgent prob-lem [2]. Actually, many techniques have been proposed to address this kind of problem [2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11]. For example, one naive method is to recommend the most pop-ular items. Moreover, some methods alleviate the cold start problem by understanding users with their input informa-tion [6, 8] or leveraging the meta data of items [11]. Since the user may not want to input her real information for some reasons (e.g., privacy issue) and the meta data is not always available, as an alternative, some other methods try to ask the user to provide a set of ratings for their elaborately se-lected seed items (i.e., the first several items recommended to a cold start user), so as to collect the user X  X  explicit rating preferences [2, 3, 7, 10] with a few interventions.
However, these related techniques focus on the way of choosing representative items (e.g., with high rating vari-ance or entropy) to predict the preferences of the new user for each specific item. In some real applications, in contrast to this individual perspective strategy, the commercial sys-tems often directly offer some discounted or free items to the new users so as to elicit them to consume as many items as possible. Thus, the profit of the system will increase.
To that end, in the following, we mainly focus on the way of recommending and evaluating seed items from this sys-tematic and marketing perspective. Specifically, we aim to automatically find out the seed items that can bring in more consumptions (i.e., influential seed items), without any ex-tra interventions from the users. Along this line, we first construct a weighted and directed item network for captur-ing the users X  general consumption behaviors and the items X  consumption correlations. Then, the problem can be formal-ized as selecting the most influential seed items from this network. Next, we propose several methods (e.g., PageR-ank based methods), each of which selects influential seed items according to different rules and capturing different in-formation. Finally, we evaluate the presented methods on two real-world data sets Flixster and Douban. The experi-mental results verify that with different seed items, the user-s X  consumption numbers will be quite different. They also demonstrate that just recommending popular items is not a very effective way to help the system understand and attract users, and better results can be achieved by the algorithms exploiting items X  influence or correlations. The main contri-butions of this paper can be summarized as follows.
Inthefollowing,weuse U = { U 1 ,U 2 , ..., U M } and I = {
I 1 ,I 2 , ..., I N } to represent the set of users and the set of items, respectively.

In real applications, when a user registers into a sys-tem (e.g., an online movie theater), the system usually offers Figure 1: An example of item consumption network. this cold start user some discounted or free items (e.g., some free movies to watch). There are possibly two kinds of tasks for these free items, the first one is to find out each user X  X  unique preferences (individual perspective), and the other is to attract the user for more consumptions (systematic per-spective). Having said, current researches mainly focus on the way of fulfilling the the first task, to our best knowl-edge, the second aim has so far been overlooked. Since the profit of the system goes directly with the number of users X  consumptions, to that end, we focus on the seed item rec-ommendation problem from the systematic perspective.
Along this line, there should be mainly two characteristics of the seed items. At first, they should be popular rather than representative. This means we should select the items that are generally enjoyed by the previous users so as to get a potential high acceptance rate. Secondly, they should be influential , which means the seed item should have the abil-ity to bring in future consumptions. Please note that, in our scenario, influence/influential is more likely used for measur-ing the ability of items X  consumption correlations, and this is a little bit different from that used in social networks [1].
Then, the problem is how to describe items based on the above two characteristics. Straightforwardly, they can be well represented by item consumption network, as shown by the example in Figure 1. In this network G = { I,E } , the number in each bracket () is the number of users con-sumed this specific item, and if there are m users who con-sumed/enjoyed item I i before I j , then we add a directed edge ( E ij )andtheweight( W ij ) should be m .Inthisway, we can formalize the recommendation problem as selecting the set of seed items from the item consumption network.
In this section, we describe several methods for finding the seed items from the item consumption network.
Popularity. The Popularity method presents items or-dered by the number of consumptions that they have been given. It is equivalent to ordering by the probability that a user has enjoyed the item. Popularity is a very straightfor-ward method, and is also easy for calculation.

WDegree. However, the most popular items may not be the most influential. Thus, an alternative approach is to chooses items according to t heir direct influe nce abilities, i.e., the number of following consumptions induced by the chosen item. Formally, the WDegree value for each item can be defined as: WDegree ( I i )= j  X  [1 ,N ] W ij .
Let X  X  take the network in Figure 1 as an example, and suppose we want to select one seed item. According to Pop-ularity, we will choose I 6 , which has been consumed 150 times. Instead, according to WDegree, we will select item I . We can see that, these two methods directly capture each of the two characteristics of the seed items, respectively.
Intuitively, for better describing each item, the two char-acteristics should be made use of simultaneously. The idea of PageRank can be well fitted to address this issue. PageRank, introduced by Page et al.[9], was first used for objectively measuring the importance (authority) of web pages.
Though we take advantage of the idea of PageRank, there are still some differences that should be noticed. In PageR-ank, the quality value for each web page is computed re-cursively by combining the values of the pages that link to this specific page. Thus, a page that is linked to by many pages with high PageRank receives a high rank itself. In contrast, in our situation, the out-edges are used for mea-suring each item X  X  importance, and if an item links to many items it should receive a high rank value. This can be sum-marized as: The original PageRank algorithm is used to find out where is the information going, in contrast we want to figure out where is the information from. In the following, based on the idea of PageRank, we illustrate two related methods that can be used for seed set selection.

SPageRank. This is short for Simple PageRank. In this method, each item shares the same initial PageRank value and the same decay factor d . For each item I i , its PageRank value can be formalized as the following equation:  X  where N is the number of items and InDe ( I j )isthenum-ber of edges link to I j (in-degree). PR ( I i ) ( s ) is the PageR-ank value for I i after s (e.g.,30) steps iteration.
WPageRank. In contrast to Simple PageRank, weight-ed PageRank takes the observed consumptions as weight to learn the PageRank values. For WPageRank, item I i  X  X  PageRank value can be formalized as the following equation: I ,and InWe ( I j ) is the total weight of edges link to I j
Circuit. This is a social influence model based on elec-trical circuit theory to simulate the information propagation process [5] in social networks, which we proposed in [12]. D-ifferent from the previous methods which do not consider the possible influence overlaps between seed items and select all the items simultaneously, the Circuit method identifies the independent influence of each item and selects the seeds one by one following a greedy strategy. Specifically, the number of consumptions (popularity) on each item is used for mea-suring the probability that an event happens on the given item, and the weight of each edge stands for the probability that the information of this event may propagate through this edge. In this way, the seed item set can be selected by solving the social influence maximization problem [5], for more detailed information please refer to [12].
All the experiments were performed on two real-world rat-ing (in the 1-to-5 scale) data sets: Flixster [4] and Douban since the rating records in both of them last for more than 5 years and there are strong correlations between rating orders and the users X  consumption (watch) orders 2 . The detailed information is described in Table 1.
We collected from the douban.com.
There may be a few exceptions.
Since we focus on the positive rating records, we removed the records with rating value lower than 3, and removed the users who gave more than 500 ratings because the correla-tions between their ratings will be very weak. In Figure 2, we take Flixster data as an example and show the power law dis-tributions of the items X  popularity and weighted out-degree. From Figure 2(c) we can see that, though positive correla-tions between each item X  X  popularity and it X  X  out-degree can be observed, there are still some fluctuations. Thus, most popular items may not be most influential and vice versa. Figure 2: The distributions of Flixster items X  popu-larity (a), weighted out-degree (b) and the relation-ships between popularity and out-degree (c).
In this section, we present a performance comparison of both effectiveness and efficiency between each method. We fix d equal to 0 . 85 for PageRank based methods 3 .
Effectiveness. To evaluate the selected seed items and the effectiveness of each algorithm, we use Average-Consumption Number-After Given Item (AveNum) as a metric, which di-rectly measures how many items will be consumed by the test user after the seed item(s). It is formally defined as:
Where U k is the set of users in the test set who have con-sumed k items from the selected item set S .Thus, RN U i S j is the number of U i  X  X  consumptions after she consumed seed item S j .If k = 0, then we consider all of U i  X  X  consump-tions(this value can be also viewed as baseline). In the ex-periments, each time 4/5 users and their ratings are used for training, i.e., constructing the consumption network and selecting the seed items S , and then the AveNum value of the remaining 1/5 users are computed for testing. At last, we give the average result of these five testing splits.
We run each method and use their selected Top-10 items as seeds to evaluate the performances. Figure 3 illustrates
Different values of d contribute little impact on the results. the AveNum result that we get by the 5 methods with re-spect to different number of consumed seeds (k). Generally, the more seed items the test users have consumed, the more items they will consume in the future. Since SPageRank, WPageRank and Circuit methods capture both of the two characteristics of seed items, they usually perform better than Popularity and WDegree. However, the WPageRank and Circuit methods, which perform similar with each other, do not perform better than SPageRank, and we think the reasons are the following: Different from SPageRank which only exploits the structure of the item graph, WPageRank and Circuit also rely on the exact observations, and based on these observations, the importance of items X  popularity is manually raised or reduced. Thus, these two methods X  performance will be impacted if there exists bias in observa-tions, and this manually weight adjustment may break the balance between popularity and influence.

Efficiency. All the methods are performed on the same platform, and Table 2 shows their average execution time 4 Without a surprise, on both data sets Popularity and WDe-gree cost the least time due to their simplicity, and since Circuit model has to choose the seed items one by one fol-lowing a greedy algorithm, it performs the worst.
In summary, Popularity and WDegree are easy for imple-mentation, but this also brings in their poor performance. Considering both effectiveness and efficiency, SPageRank seems to be the most suitable seed items selection method. However, many more deep understandings should be provid-ed before we make this conclusion.
In this section, we give an analysis of the selection results and they provide more insights into each method.

At first, Figure 4 shows the Jaccard similarity coefficien-t of the seed items (Top-10 for each data split) chosen by the selection methods. We can see that similar coefficient results can be observed from Flixster and Douban. First, the result got by SPageRank is most different from other-s. Second, since Popularity and WDegree capture different characters of the items, their choosing items are also differ-ent from each other. Third, similar to the observations in Figure 1, the output of WPageRank and Circuit have very
Note that the time consuming on constructing item net-work is not included, which are similar for each method. Table 3: Number of Douban users with different k. strong correlations. We believe the reason lies in the close relation between Circuit and WPageRank [12].

Then, we compare the shortest distances between the seed items. We set the distance among two neighbor vertexes algorithm for each seed item set we find that the seed items output by Popularity and WDegree are usually very close to each other(with average distance less than 1). In contrast, the seeds output by SPageRank, WPageRank and Circuit often locate in different subnetworks, and thus no path can be found 5 . As example, Table 3 lists the number of Douban users who consumed k (1, 5 and 10) of the seed items with respect to different methods. From Table 3 we can see that when k equals to 1, the | U k | are similar for each method, and this also reveal that there is no big difference between the average consumption numbers (popularity) of each single seed item selected by different methods. However, much less users consumed all the 10 seed items that are selected by SPageRank, WPageRank and Circuit, respectively.
 Figure 4: The coefficient of the seed item set select-ed by each method on Flixster(L) and Douban(R).

Based on the observations from shortest distances and Ta-ble 3, we conclude that though the seed items selected by SPageRank, WPageRank and Circuit are also popular items, they are more diverse, e.g., these items may be chosen from different user groups or from different categories. In the fu-ture, we plan to find some data sets with available meta data for understanding the selected items more deeply.
In this section, we analyze the advantages and limitations of current influential seed items recommendation, and show the directions for our future work.

From the experimental results we can see that, by con-sidering the general behavior of users, it is reasonable to find many seed items and recommend them to the cold start users, so as to help the system earn more profit. Further-more, by exploiting the influence of candidate items, we can get a better recommendation result. However, there are still many limitations of current work. At first, we do not deeply consider the utility of each single user and their personal-ized acceptance. Second, in this paper, we assume each user X  X  consumption are time ordered and correlated, then make use of the order of users X  consumptions to measure
In this situation, the influence of items are almost indepen-dent from each other, and no need for finding overlaps. item influence , and the consumption correlations produced between different lengths of time are weighted equally. This simplicity also leads to some shortages, for example the long time ago consumption may have little contribution on user X  X  current purchase. Third, none of the existing factors that account for the consumption orders are included in current ideal recommendation strategy, such as the items X  life cycles.
According to these limitations, there are many direction-s for our future work. At first, we plan to evaluate our methods in the real-world applications. Meanwhile, figuring out the way of combining advantages from both representa-tive [2, 7, 10] and general item selections for making more reasonable recommendations. More importantly, we plan to consider domain knowledge and constraints (e.g., some meta data and the time factor) into the seed selection process.
In this paper, we provide a systematic perspective on choosing and evaluating seed items for cold start user recom-mendation. We first formalize initial item recommendation as the influential seed set selection problem for the item con-sumption network. Then, we present several influential seed items selection methods. At last, the performance of these methods are evaluated on two real-world data sets. The ex-perimental study delivers encouraging results, and we hope this work could lead to many future work.
