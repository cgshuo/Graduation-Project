In psychology, intelligence is the general mental ability involved in calculating, reasoning, perceiving relation-ships and analogies, learning, storing and retrieving information, using language fluently, classifying, generalizing, and adjusting to new situations. According to Alfred Binet, intelligence is the totality of mental processes involved in adapting to the environment [ 6 ]. We understand by Intelligent Computing (IC), a combi-nation of these intelligence facets involved in information processing and focused on providing intelligence to different aspects of computer applications. We use terms intelligent computing and artificial intelligence (AI) as synonyms of a dis-cipline that generates tools that, in turn, provide intelligence, although they may be defined slightly differently in the technical literature. In most of the cases, we are also looking for the integration of these machine intelligence capabilities with human intelligence.
 ganizational context. Knowledge management (KM) embodies the organizational processes that seek a synergic combination of the data and information-processing capabilities of information technologies, with the creative and innovative abilities of human beings. In simpler terms, KM seeks to make the best use of knowledge that is available to an organization. In this sense, we consider KM solutions when both machine and human intelligent capabilities are applied within the organiza-tional context. We stress that from our point of view both IC and KM are mostly integrative practices.
 from different countries and continents (US, Mexico, UK, Spain, Russia, Singa-pore) discussing current trends of these technologies and based on their experience in developing industrial applications. These trends are considered from three dif-ferent perspectives: current trends in automation from an industrial perspective; trends in IT methodologies to cope with industrial challenges; and a technologi-cal perspective, i.e. trying to find the best suitable technologies and technological frameworks supporting these methodologies. We try to follow these trends through cutting edge application examples from the automotive, chemical, oil &amp; gas, and transportation industries covered in this special issue. 2 A new age of industrial automation In this section, we will try to answer the following question: what are the new de-mands on information technologies at the current stage of industrial automation? To answer, let us start with the main challenges in economy. Nowadays, industrial organizations have to constantly update market and organizational capacities to attain a competitive advantage, innovation, and agility in their business processes. Ann Macintosh [ 3 ] identified some of these specific business factors. We consider that associated with today X  X  market, these factors can be grouped within the two basic categories. The first group associated with the complexity and dynamicity of products and services is composed of the following factors:  X  Products and services are increasingly complex, endowing them with a signif- X  There is a need to manage increasing complexity as small operating companies  X  This complexity implies collaborative participation of the diverse experts to- X  Companies look for more flexible organization structures to respond to the  X  Control of the processes must be flexible enough to account both for the dy- X  On the other hand, the second group is associated with the company X  X  know- X  Market places are increasingly competitive and the rate of innovation is rising.

Modern industry shows evolving complexity of technical processes. For the refinery supply chain (SC) discussed in the paper  X  X rtificial intelligence methodologies for agile refining: An overview X  by R. Srinivasan, for example, this complexity is revealed starting with the available alternatives to obtain the raw materials, their transport and storage; the diversity of the chemical, mechani-cal, and physical process for refining, and the network of channels and conditions of oil, fuel, and gas distribution.
 agement have evolved due to considerable changes in design, operation, procure-ment, and management. The flexible process control and supply chain concepts have been applied successfully in the oil &amp; gas industry. Management of the steps of supply, manufacturing or operation chain requires to automate the integration of the parts of the whole production, distribution logistics, and sales. As we see from the paper by R. Srinivasan, there are specialized systems in the oil industry to support from crude oil acquisition to terminal and depot management, thus cut-ting across the complex web of logistics, manufacturing, and sales. These systems have to enable the agility of the whole chain, the ability to proactively respond to a dynamic environment through responsiveness to customers, product and process innovation and operational flexibility.
 successfully in Automotive industry as one of the leaders in this innovation pro-cess: in 2001, Ford Motor Company reported the largest R&amp;D expenditures ($7.4 billion) among the private sector of the U.S. economy [ 5 ]. The paper  X  X ntelligent systems in the automotive industry: Applications and trends X  by O. Gusikhin, N. Rychtyckyj and D. Filev analyzes the evolution and the impact of the IC tech-nologies in this industry. As we can see, the improvements started from the basic functions of in-vehicle intelligence, design and manufacturing processes and data mining in warranty analysis and evolved to the complex integrated solutions like vehicle assembly planning, assembly sequencing and production control as well as on introducing supply chain (SC) and corporate KM.
 environments that are increasingly more global, complex, and connected. SC is a particular facet of such type of organizations. These new enterprise models have emerged as a response to market challenges. Virtual and networked or-ganizations arise as alternatives providing services beyond the traditional busi-ness boundaries and scopes. In the paper  X  X ntology-driven intelligent service for configuration support in networked organizations X  by A. Smirnov et al., the be-haviour of a networked organization is compared to that of an intelligent organi-zation. The latter  X  X ehaves as an open system which takes in information, mate-rial and energy from the environment, transforms these resources into knowledge, processes and structures that produce goods or services which are in turn con-sumed by the environment X  [ 2 ]. Such behaviour assumes the existence of organi-zation  X  X ntellectual abilities, X  i.e. abilities to create, exchange, process, and infer knowledge.
 cur. Modeling of complex industrial and business processes addresses the classi-fication and categorization of technical as well as business management informa-tion and the integration of all the information processes. That is why the business operations area is making a powerful push of IT with systems that integrate the different parts of the business. This new trend on industrial automation demands systems able to handle information and knowledge (I&amp;K) in a more efficient and integral way. We call this trend an intelligent automation. 3 Intelligent and knowledge-based automation The question we would like to be answered in this section is as follows: what are the most suitable approaches to tackle the challenge of intelligent automation? First of all, we look for the methodologies and the deployment of tools result-ing in agile technical processing. Methodologies drawn from traditional artificial intelligence X  X oftware agents, pattern recognition, expert systems X  X ave a role to play in this path towards agility. As an example, we can consider design automa-tion, which is increasingly applying knowledge-based engineering (KBE) con-cepts and methods as defined by Gousikhin et al., the use of computer tools to enhance the design process by bringing engineering design, manufacturing engi-neering, consumer-related and other appropriate knowledge up front in the cre-ation process and, wherever possible, to automate the process. The application of KBE addresses the modeling of the reasoning process used by the design engi-neer and evaluates it against predetermined design criteria and standards. It also integrates symbolic and numeric computation.
 pert systems to provide smarter support for the decision-maker began evolving into the concept of organizational knowledge management about a decade ago, and are now beginning to mature. Increasingly overwhelming amount of available information, used for planning, decision-making, and optimization of industrial processes demands for this methodology in order to extract knowledge from huge and diverse volumes of information. KM offers, as well, agile methods to orga-nize and reuse information for executing business procedures. Perhaps knowledge management is one of the main  X  X ot X  issues to be fully integrated as part of the cutting edge technologies providing added value to information technologies in industry. The use of knowledge management methodologies:  X  facilitates the whole design X  X eployment X  X pplication X  X rocurement industrial  X  supports the successful transfer of knowledge from senior experts (engineers,  X  allows human experts to use knowledge skills and experience from others of the effective usage of preserved knowledge, is strategic to promote sustainabil-ity of industrial services. In this special issue, KBE applications are illustrated, first through a framework for hierarchical redesign of chemical processes in the paper  X  X  hierarchical approach for the redesign of chemical processes X  by I. making on pipe stress analysis enabled by knowledge-based systems X  by M. Al-varado et al. In both works, the reasoning framework works at different levels of expertise and generates alternative design solutions based on heuristic knowl-edge coupled with the input parameters provided by the design engineer. Design parameters are processed by specific domain software, usually a simulator. De-sign proposals are generated by combining general domain knowledge and knowl-edge specific to the problem at hand, which can be implemented in knowledge-, principle-, rule-, or simulation-based systems. The reasoning and simulation sys-tems support human expert intervention when deciding upon the final design. of a framework embodying decisions representation is also needed. This can be achieved by integrating information about the designed device, the workflow steps, and the mutual knowledge among participants in the process. The trace of the workflow steps keeps a record of the decision-making process.
 structure and actionable phases requires the usage of ontologies and languages of processes to manage the amount, complexity, and variety of information to be in-tegrated. An information ontology can be described as a knowledge representation model that contains specific knowledge about a problem domain. The use of on-tologies facilitates the importation of data descriptions from various data sources as well as mapping between the concepts and relations from these sources. The current challenge is to integrate and use knowledge bases and ontologies across the entire industry supply chain. This challenge embraces the modeling of the busi-ness rules, logic, and inference strategies that describe how the processes function in each problem domain. Moreover, knowledge-managed ontologies-based infor-mation should be used for planning, decision-making, and process optimization. sign, the papers from this special issue illustrate KM application to supply chain management and operation management for nimble refineries. I&amp;K intensive tasks require a special focus on information and knowledge logistics as illustrated in the paper  X  X nowledge and information distribution leveraged by intelligent agents X  by R. Brena et al., and also in the paper by A. Smirnov et al. Knowledge logistics addresses a dynamic aspect of knowledge management: activities over the knowl-edge delivery. These activities concern acquisition, integration, and transfer of the right knowledge from distributed sources located in an information environment and its delivery in the right context, to the right person, in the right time for the right purpose. sents a prime opportunity for achieving substantial savings, significant improve-ments in human performance, and competitive advantage. That is why in the first decade of the millennium, according to a study of the worldwide AI market per-formed by Business Communication Company (BCC), the latter is estimated in more than $21 billion by 2007 with an average annual growth rate from 2002 to 2007 of 12.2% [ 4 ]. 4 Technological frameworks Finally, this technology-centric section is meant to answer the following question: which are the main techniques proved or considered to be the most suitable to support intelligent automation? The industry of today is regularly adopting new technologies. The study we cited above targets five AI technologies as the fastest growing AI components: expert systems, belief networks, decision support sys-tems, neural networks, and agents [ 4 ]. Future expectations are associated with Web intelligence based on the decentralized computing infrastructure available from autonomous software agents. Most of these technologies are referred to in the papers of this special issue.
 of complexity (technical, structural, and organizational) in industrial processes. There are several trends in information technology related to the management of complexity of technical systems: (i) the use of computational intelligence tech-niques, (ii) the use of agents to integrate methods of different computational nature (usually combining quantitative and qualitative models, soft and hard computing within the context of hybrid intelligent systems), (iii) human-centered technology searching for the synergy between human and computational intelligence, (iv) se-mantic integration of I&amp;K, and finally, (v) the use of integrated frameworks and tools implemented over interoperable infrastructures. In this section, we analyze each trend briefly.
 tegrated in the modern technological processes requires the use of flexible tech-niques providing a holistic treatment of that complexity. A promising trend of re-search enabling the integration of the huge diversity of information to be processed as well as the openness to analyze scenarios and assess situations is the deploy-ment of computational intelligence methodologies. The clear evidence of the pro-liferation of this trend can be found in the paper by O. Gusikhin et al., focusing on the applications of computational intelligence methodologies as building blocks of intelligent engineering systems providing intelligence to all aspects of automo-tive industry ranging from vehicle components up to supply chain management and corporate knowledge management. It is important to stress that computational intelligence methodologies (fuzzy logic, neural networks, evolutionary computa-tion, machine learning, knowledge representation, probabilistic/possibilistic rea-soning) have gained wide acceptance in industry due to the possibility to provide solutions for complex problems when the classical methods are infeasible, ineffi-cient, or uneconomical.
 go hand in hand with the traditional methods. In recent years, hybrid intelligent systems, integrating different AI techniques from neural networks to fuzzy logic, have made solid steps towards becoming more accepted in mainstream industry due to their capabilities to handle real-world complexities such as imprecision, uncertainty, and vagueness [ 8 ]. For example, in the paper by R. Srinivasan dis-cussing operations and SC management, hybrid integrated models are composed of different techniques: intelligent models using an agent-based approach, expert systems, dynamic time warping, data mining (trend analysis), which contrast with model-based techniques using neural networks and dynamic principal compo-nents analysis. In the paper by O. Gusikhin et al., expert systems, data mining, language processing, and agents are used for knowledge-based engineering and process planning; while agents and ontologies are used for SC and corporate KM. ferent nature. The benefits of the agent technology in contrast to the commonly used mathematical programming is that it is more versatile and can easily capture the qualitative as well as the quantitative nature of a complex technical system. The autonomous agent applications in industry carry on the usage of AI methods to deal with diverse information in a flexible manner. Examples of the applica-tion of agent technology can be found in nearly all the papers of this issue. They explore different AI techniques like multi-valued logics, genetic algorithms, and neural networks for codification of autonomous agents X  knowledge as well as the reasoning capabilities. Agents are by no means monolithic pieces of knowledge, but rather encompass many aspects such as communication, coordination tech-niques, cooperation, autonomy, competition, distribution, and mobility, among others. These particular capabilities offer the promise of increased modularity, flexibility, and adaptability when building complex systems, particularly multia-gent systems.
 that human intervention is usually required, i.e. most of the intelligent systems discussed in this issue aim to support and not substitute humans, trying to achieve synergy between human and computational intelligence. To improve the manage-ment of complexity during the redesign of technical processes in the paper by I. Lopez et al., a model-based reasoning is proposed to automatically generate alter-native representations of an existing process at several levels of abstraction; this step results in sets of units or meta-units organized according to their functions and intentions. A case-based reasoning system then retrieves from a library of cases units or meta-units similar to the one selected by the user, according to the function and intention of a unit and its neighbors. The final output is a set of cases (units or meta-units) ordered according to their similarity. Human designer provides the input to the system and interprets the results, adapting the most promising case within the original process.
 that is a software tool used to obtain the design description of the process together with the functional analysis that is modeled using the data extracted, the simulator is also used to implement and evaluate the generated alternative process designs. Then the reasoner, case-based in the paper by L  X  opez et al. or rule-based in the paper by Alvarado et al., identifies the suitable equipment/section to be modified and generates more adequate equipment/sections based on the new requirements; as the next stage, using the redesign criteria and human design expertise, the reasoner generates alternatives based on the identified candidates, and evaluates them such that the most similar/promising one is ready to be adapted by the user into the original process based on the evaluation of its performance within the overall process. This is an iterative cycle that finishes when an appropriate alter-native process design is obtained according to the new objectives.
 the information flows and to implement an efficient reuse of existing knowledge. In knowledge-intensive industries, information is a major production factor and knowledge reflects an important asset of the enterprise. Several papers from this issue tackle the problem of integration and sharing of I&amp;K available from hetero-geneous data sources, such as databases, Web sites, and specialized data servers. They show that the functionality and usability of information systems can be aug-mented by incorporating knowledge representation and inference techniques from AI. From the papers by A. Smirnov et al., I. L  X  opez-Ar  X  evalo et al., and R. Brena et al., we can see a new dimension of information and knowledge integration reached with the use of ontologies for semantic information management.
 tems (such as concurrent engineering or corporate knowledge management), the meaning of the information that is interchanged has to be understood across the systems. The use of ontologies for the explication of implicit and hidden knowl-edge is a possible approach to overcome the problem of semantic heterogeneity [ 7 ]. Ontological modeling is one of the technologies playing a key role both in Web-empowered and knowledge-intensive applications widely covered in this is-sue. Ontologies set up languages that organize information around the relevant as-pects of the industrial domain like the information on workflow, tasks, and goals of the processes. The dynamic information is being modeled by languages of busi-ness processes capturing the complex relationships among the parts of the process. the automotive industry is illustrated through the ability to read and understand free-form text. The method for dealing with unstructured text developed at Ford Motor Company contains a mechanism for the automated creation of rules that are then utilized to deliver targeted unstructured information. This system reduces the amount of time that must be spent by manufacturing engineers that are responsible for maintaining manufacturing engineering knowledge.
 contain numerous heterogeneous components involved in complex interactions within dynamic organizational contexts. The breakthrough technologies to handle this type of complexity are Web intelligence and agents. Web intelligence deals with the advancement of Web-empowered systems, services, and environments. It includes issues of Web-based knowledge processing and management; distributed inference; information exchange and knowledge sharing [ 9 ]. The papers of this special issue by A. Smirnov et al. and R. Brena et al. propose technological ontology-driven frameworks based on very similar principles of Web intelligence. Ontological models form the main constituent element of these technological frameworks (KSNet, JITIK, PROSIS) providing a common knowledge represen-tation for integrated frameworks and tools. These tools use Web services widely, an emerging technology enabling application integration in the enterprise infor-mation system in a service-oriented fashion. These architectures support loosely coupled services to enable business flexibility in an interoperable technology that allows the integration of components without the need to know which technology is behind each of them, adapting to the component X  X  technology without changing its original functionality [ 1 ]. 5 Concluding remarks Papers selected for this special issue cover different aspects of intelligent com-puting and KM for industrial intelligent automation. We believe that systems, in-corporating the synergy of human and computational intelligence along with the hybrid schemes within their functional components, will be able to make signifi-cant steps towards changing the  X  X lack box X  image that has been associated with several AI-related techniques and bring it closer to a  X  X ransparent box X  enhancing its acceptance by practitioners.
 could discuss in this special issue. This set of articles does not necessarily illumi-nate everything that is happening in intelligent automation, but aims to take a step towards our understanding of the real potential of intelligent computing for indus-trial automation. We look forward to continued work in this area and to the day when the intelligent computing serves us more actively and with more enlighten-ment.
