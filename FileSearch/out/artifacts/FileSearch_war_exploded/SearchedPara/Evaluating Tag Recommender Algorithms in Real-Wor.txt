 To date, the evaluation of tag recommender algorithms has mostly been conducted in limited ways, including p -core pruned datasets, a small set of compared algorithms and solely based on recommender accuracy. In this study, we use an open-source evaluation framework to compare a rich set of state-of-the-art algorithms in six unfiltered, open data-sets via various metrics, measuring not only accuracy but also the diversity, novelty and computational costs of the approaches. We therefore provide a transparent and re-producible tag recommender evaluation in real-world folk-sonomies. Our results suggest that the efficacy of an al-gorithm highly depends on the given needs and thus, they should be of interest to both researchers and developers in the field of tag-based recommender systems.

Since social tagging has become an essential Web 2.0 tool for collaborative content annotation, research on tag rec-ommenders has significantly expanded over the past years. Tag recommender algorithms process folksonomy data in order to assist people in finding descriptive tags for their bookmarked resources. Although a number of tag recom-mender evaluation studies have been performed (e.g., [6, 5, 13, 11]), most of them have only involved a limited view of the tag recommender evaluation process with respect to the algorithms, datasets and evaluation metrics included. Fur-thermore, most of these evaluations were conducted only on c  X  2015 ACM. ISBN 978-1-4503-3692-5/15/09 ...$15.00. using the C++ code provided by the University of Kon-stanz 2 (2011-07-14). Unless stated otherwise in the text, we applied the default parameter settings for the algorithms specified in the frameworks.
In this study, we used a wide range of folksonomy-based tag recommender algorithms. We focused on folksonomy-based rather than content-based approaches for two reasons: first, freely available social tagging datasets typically do not contain content data about the resources (e.g., title or de-scription) and second, Rendle et al. [13] proved that person-alized folksonomy-based approaches outperform the theoret-ically best unpersonalized method (to which content-based algorithms typically belong). The algorithms for our com-parative study were chosen based on their novelty, popular-ity and effect in the field. Since previous tag recommender studies mostly employed classic approaches, we attempted to expand the coverage by also including novel time-based and cognitive-inspired algorithms.

The simplest approaches that we utilized are the frequency-based MostPopular r (MP r ) and MostPopular u,r (MP u,r ) al-gorithms [5] and Collaborative Filtering (CF) [12] with a neighborhood size of 20. As for algorithms that apply la-tent factor models, we chose two types of algorithms: La-tent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [10] with 1000 latent topics and Pairwise Interaction Tensor Factorization (PITF) [14] with 256 dimensions of factorization. Another well-known tag recommender approach we chose for this study was Folk-Rank (FR) [5]. With regard to time-dependent tag recom-menders, we included four algorithms: Temporal Tag Usage Patterns (GIRPTM) [15] that works in a more data-driven way and three that are inspired by models of cognitive sci-ence. The first one of this kind, BLL AC [7], is the only algo-rithm in our study that works solely on the individual level and thus, can only recommend tags used by the target user in the past. Furthermore, we also included BLL AC +MP r , which extends BLL AC by also recommending tags that were assigned by other users to the target resource [7]. The third cognitive-inspired algorithm (and last one in this study) is the 3LT+MP r approach [9]. In this section, we describe the datasets used in our study. We chose a set of six freely available folksonomy datasets: Flickr 3 (2010-01-07), CiteULike 4 (2015-02-03), BibSonomy 5 (2015-01-01), Delicious 3 (2010-01-07), LastFM 6 (2011-05-12) and MovieLens 7 (2009-01-05). These datasets differ in terms of their domain type (i.e., images, URLs, citations, music and movies), size and narrowness degree. For the purposes of this study, we defined the degree of narrowness as the average number of posts assigned to a resource which also correlates with the commonly known definition of nar-row and broad folksonomies [4]. http://www.informatik.uni-konstanz.de/rendle/software/ tag-recommender/ https://www.uni-koblenz.de/FB4/Institutes/IFI/ AGStaab/Research/DataSets/PINTSExperimentsDataSets http://www.citeulike.org/faq/data.adp http://www.kde.cs.uni-kassel.de/bibsonomy/dumps http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec2011/ hetrec2011-lastfm-2k.zip http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m.zip
Computational Costs. Since recommendations should not only be accurate, diverse and novel but also be provided in (near) real-time, we determined the computational costs of the algorithms in terms of Runtime (in seconds) and Mem-ory (in megabytes) required. Both runtime and memory are measured for the complete workflow of the algorithms (in-cluding training and testing) using an IBM System x3550 M4 Server with one Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 v2 @ 2.00GHz and 256GB RAM.
We followed a standard evaluation procedure in tag rec-ommender research (e.g., [5]) to split our datasets mentioned in Section 2.2 into training and test sets. To that end, for each user, the set of tags in her most recent post in time were put it into the test set and the remaining posts were then used to train the algorithms. This protocol is a promising simulation of a real-world social tagging environment since it preserves the chronological order of the data and predicts Table 3: Summary of the performance of the algo-rithms in real-world folksonomies showing tag rec-ommender accuracy in narrow and broad settings, diversity (Div), novelty (Nov), runtime and mem-ory consumption.  X ++ X  indicates best,  X + X  good,  X - X  poor and an empty space average performance.

The difference between the narrow and broad settings are especially of interest when comparing our results with previ-ous studies (e.g., [6, 5, 13, 11]), in which FR and PITF typ-ically had the best recommender accuracy in p -core pruned (i.e., very broad) folksonomies. Our results also indicate a good performance of FR and PITF in broad folksonomies but a fairly poor one in the narrow settings. The opposite is the case for the BLL AC approach, which strictly operates on the individual level and thus, performs well in the narrow setting but is only average in the broad setting.

Furthermore, the most diverse tag recommendations are provided via the classic approaches LDA, PITF and FR. With regard to novelty, the strictly individual BLL AC ap-proach outperforms all the other algorithms (which operate also on the collective level). As for the computational costs, the best runtime results are delivered by the frequency-based methods MP r , MP u,r and GIRPTM and the lowest memory is required by the PITF approach. One reason for the low memory consumption of PITF is surely the fact that it was developed in C++ (the other approaches were implemented in Java). Additionally, the cognitive-inspired BLL AC +MP r approach that has the highest recommender accuracy also provides fair results in terms of the other metrics. Inter-estingly, this is not the case for the other cognitive-inspired algorithm 3LT+MP r which has poor runtime and memory consumption estimates since it requires a computationally expensive topic calculation step (see [9]).
Providing helpful tag recommendations in real-world folk-sonomies is not a trivial task, which greatly depends on the given user needs, as our results suggest. If recommender ac-curacy is mostly important, cognitive-inspired algorithms, such as BLL AC +MP r , provide the best results. If runtime is crucial, simple frequency-based methods, such as MP u,r , should be applied. Although the classic approaches (CF, LDA, PITF and FR) known from most previous studies do not seem to be the best choice in terms of accuracy in these (mostly narrow) real-world settings, they provide the most diverse recommendations. The most novel tags, however, can be recommended via strictly individual methods, such as the cognitive-inspired BLL AC algorithm.

Thus, we believe that our results should be of interest to both researchers and developers in the field of tag-based rec-
