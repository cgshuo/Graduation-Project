 While a major share of prior work have considered search sessions as the focal unit of analysis for seeking behavioral insights, search tasks are emerging as a competing perspec-tive in this space. In the current work, we quantify user search task behavior for both single-as well as multi-task search sessions and relate it to tasks and topics. Specif-ically, we analyze user-disposition, topic and user-interest level heterogeneities that are prevalent in search task be-havior. Our results show that while search multi-tasking is a common phenomenon among the search engine users, the extent and choice of multi-tasking topics vary significantly across users. We find that not only do users have vary-ing propensities to multi-task, they also search for distinct topics across single-task and multi-task sessions. To our knowledge, this is among the first studies to fully character-ize online search tasks with a focus on user-and topic-level differences that are observable from search sessions.

Users X  information search behavior on search engines of-ten span various motivations [2 , 14 ]. While simple informa-tional needs, such as  X  X dele X  X  latest music X  can be satisfied in a single search session, most other informational needs are complex and time-consuming. Consequently, users ac-complish more complex information search tasks by issuing a series of search queries spanning multiple search sessions, possibly spread over multiple days. While a major portion of existing work have investigated search behavior using search sessions as the fundamental focus of search activity [ 6, 18, 19 , 20 , 24 , 25], more recent studies suggest that users often seek to complete multiple search tasks within a single search session [ 14 , 15 , 22 ], while also taking multiple sessions to fin-ish a single task at times. The emergence of multi-tasking behavior within a single search session makes it particularly complex to use user information from search sessions to per-sonalize the user X  X  search activity. This necessitates a shift in focus from search sessions to search tasks as a more ac-curate unit of analysis of human search behavior.

In our current analyses, we build upon search sessions to identify and characterize search tasks and topics. In charac-terizing these search tasks across sessions, we consider the possibility of three distinct forms of heterogeneity inherent in the search-task behavior. First, there could be user-disposition level heterogeneity wherein some users have a higher propensity to multi-task when searching for informa-tion, than other users. Second, there could be topic level heterogeneity wherein searchers have a higher (or lower) propensity to multi-task when searching information for spe-cific kind of topics. Third, and finally, there could be user-interest level heterogeneity wherein users might have a higher or lower propensity to multi-task when searching for topics they are most or least interested in.

While recent work has highlighted the prevalence of multi-tasking behavior in online search [14 , 15, 22 ], not much effort has been expended at fully characterizing online search tasks with an emphasis on such user-and topic-level differences. In the current study, we leverage a large dataset of real world search logs to perform a large scale characterization of search tasks with a focus on such differences. Specifically, we find that while most users ( &gt; 50%) choose to multi-task in their search sessions, there exists significant differences in their choice of topics between single-task and multi-task sessions. Through our analyses we offer the following three insights: (i) Users X  preference towards multitasking(3.2): We find evidence that most users multi-task when searching for information with over 50% users completing more than 2 tasks within a single search session, and a minority of users even completing more than 5 tasks within a single session. (ii) Topic level heterogeneity(3.3 ): For certain type of topics, users prefer to multi-task (e.g. kids, news, shopping etc.), while for certain others, users prefer to single-task (e.g. computers, games, adult etc.). (iii) User-interest level heterogeneity(3.4 ): Users have different preferences towards multitasking depending on their level of interest in the specific search topic (e.g. some groups of users prefer to search about most-interested topics in single-tasking sessions and least-interested topics in mult-tasking sessions).
Analyzing such heterogeneities in online search behavior lends us a better understanding of how users interact with search systems when performing different tasks.
There has been a large body of work focused on the prob-lem of segmenting and organizing query logs into semanti-cally coherent structures. Many of these methods use the idea of a timeout cutoff between queries, where two con-secutive queries are considered as two different sessions or tasks if the time interval between them exceeds a certain threshold, often 30 minutes [5, 9, 20 ]. However, the experi-mental results of these methods indicate that the timeouts, whatever their lengths, are of limited utility in predicting whether two queries belong to the same task, and unsuit-able for identifying session boundaries. There have been at-tempts to extract in-session tasks [11 , 14 , 21 ], cross-session tasks [12 , 23 , 13 ] and hierarchies of tasks and subtasks [16 ] from query sequences based on classification and clustering methods. While existing research has investigated user be-havior separately across sessions [ 1] and across tasks [10 ], in this work, we fully characterize search tasks with a focus on user and topic level differences, and jointly model user interactions across sessions, topics and tasks.
We characterize online search sessions with a focus on the underlying user-level and topic level heterogeneities. As mentioned earlier, we investigate the prevalence of three re-lated forms of search heterogeneity viz. (i) user-disposition level (do focused users behave differently than multi-taskers), (ii) topic level (are some topics more prone to multi-tasking?), and (iii) user-interest level differences in search behavior (do users X  task behavior vary across their topical interests). We next describe our experimental setup (Section 3.1 ) based on which we discuss our findings in Section 3.2 , 3.3 &amp; 3.4 .
We use backend search logs for users of a major US-based search engine for a period of 30 days from May 1, 2015 to May 31, 2015 and choose a random sample of over 2 million users where each user is identified by a unique IP address. For our analysis, we filter out inactive users from our dataset who participate in &lt; 50 sessions, and focus instead on the more active user population. Table 1 presents a summary of the query, session and task information in our empirical context. Our dataset comprises 620 million queries spanning 190 million search sessions, with an average of 3 queries and 2 tasks per search session. For our analysis, we make use of the Latent Structural SVM framework [ 23 ] for task identification. Given query se-quences within sessions, search tasks are identified by clus-tering queries into tasks by find the strongest link between a candidate query and queries in the target cluster ( bestlink ). This is achieved by making use of a structural learning method with latent variables, i.e., latent structural SVMs, to utilize the hidden structure of query inter-dependencies to explore the dependency among queries within the same task.

Given a query sequence Q = q 1 ,q 2 ,...,q M , a feature vector for the task partition y is specified by the hidden best-link structure h as  X  ( Q,y,h ). Based on  X  ( Q,y,h ), the bestlink SVM is a linear model parameterized by w , and predicts the task partition by, where Y and H represent the sets of possible structures of y and h respectively. y  X  becomes the output for cross-session tasks and h  X  is the inferred latent structure. Based on the best-link structure, h ( q i ,q j ) = 1 if query q i and q rectly connected in h; and otherwise, h ( q i ,q j ) = 0, with the added clause that a a query can only link to another query feature vector for any particular task partition y is defined over the links in h as, where a set of symmetric pairwise features  X  s ( q i ,q j to characterize the similarity between query q i and q j . Given a set of query logs with annotated tasks, the feature vector design and the directed linkage structure of h can be inferred in an SVM setting. A detailed overview of the approach can be found in Wang et al. [23 ].
Search sessions have been exploited in previous work on information search, as being the major focus for most analy-sis of search behavior. The context of search activities within the current session has been used to build richer models of interests and improve how the search system interprets the user X  X  current query. Session context has been used for mod-eling query and click sequences [ 4, 3], to disambiguate cur-rent search query [ 17 ], to build topical profiles for future interest prediction [24 ], to improve search quality [ 25 , 6] to quantify struggling users [ 18 ], for understanding learning and expertise development [ 8] and for detecting atypicality in user behavior [ 7].

While search sessions are an important and convenient source for analysis, we contend that this conceptualization of sessions as focal units of analysis makes certain assumptions that are quite untenable in the general case. First, there ex-ists no theoretical basis for bounding search sessions, as it is largely a data-driven subject. Previous research on the topic have adopted a time-out based strategy to bound search ses-sions [ 5, 9, 20 ]. However, it remains to be understood if such time-out based techniques have strong external valid-ity across search contexts. Second, and most importantly, evidence from our own analysis of search logs show that users do indeed search for multiple unrelated topics within a single search session. Based on the task extracted within and across search sessions ( 3.1.2 ), our analysis hints at the presence of multiple search tasks within single session. This has been shown in Tables 1 and 2. In Table 2 we provide an illustration of a single search session (tagged session ID = 1) and the 2 different tasks that we have been able to identify from within the search session. Further, we also list the ODP topics that we could extract from the associated queries for each of the tasks. Since search sessions are inherently com-plex and often comprise a combination of multiple search tasks and topics, we shift our focus in the current study to analyze user-and topic-level differences across search tasks within and across sessions.
Recent work on the topic of search multi-tasking has shown that a majority of users perform two or more tasks within a single search session [ 15 ]. Consistent with these studies, our analysis also uncovers that close to 55% of users perform two or more tasks within single sessions, with a minority of users even performing 5 or more tasks within the single session, as illustrated in Figure 1. Following Mehrotra et al. [15 ], we term these three discernible classes of users based on their frequency of multitasking behavior viz. focused (i.e. 1 task per session), multitaskers (i.e. 2-5 tasks per session) and supertaskers (i.e. &gt; 5 tasks per session). Having established that users vary on their disposition to single-task and multi-task, we now delve deeper into understanding whether users multi-task to varying extents depending on their topics.
To obtain such a topic representation for this study, we labeled each document with a vector of probabilities of cat-egories from the top two levels of the ODP hierarchy us-ing a text-based classifier. Each documents vector was re-stricted to the three most probable classes. The classifier has a micro-averaged F1 value of 0.60 and is described more fully in [24 ]. The most prominent topic among the top 3 re-turned results per query was used as the final tagged topic for that query.

We analyse topic level heterogeneity by investigating the level of multi-tasking in sessions filtered by topics. Our re-sults are illustrated in Figure 2 wherein we highlight the top 4 most prevalent topics across multi-tasking and single-tasking sessions (top to bottom panels), for all three cate-gory of users (left to right panels). The length of the bars in each of the charts in the Figure 2 highlights the extent of multitasking (top panels) and the extent of single-tasking (bottom panels). The extent of multi-tasking is defined as portion of times the topic featured in a multi-tasking ses-sion ( N M ) and the proportion of times the topic featured in a single-tasking session ( N S ). Conversely, the extent of single-tasking was calculated as the difference between the proportion of times the topic featured in a single-tasking session and the proportion of times the topic featured in a multi-tasking session.

We find that focused users primarily multi-task for top-M ost Interested Topics 0 .593 0 .407 0 .310 0 .690 0 .105 0 .895 Le ast Interested Topics 0 .458 0 .542 0 .249 0 .751 0 .081 0 .919 ics related to shopping, home, kids, health and recreation. However, both multi-and super-taskers have a shared pref-erence for multi-tasking on topics related to news, sports and arts. We also observe that focused users prefer to single task when searching for topics related to computers, games, adult and arts categories, while multi-taskers and super-taskers do not prefer to single-task when searching for their preferred topics. This is reflected by the negative scores on the extent of single-tasking in the bottom panel of Figure 2. These findings confirm our intuition that indeed certain topics are more prone to multi-tasking (e.g. news, sports) while oth-ers (e.g. computers, adult) usually witness single tasking sessions.
We next investigate whether users exercise any specific search preference when searching for topics that are of high vs. low interest to them. To analyze this, we compute the frequency of most and least searched topic categories from the search history of users in each of the three user groups viz. focused, multi-taskers and super-taskers 1 . Following this, we analyze their search behavior during single-tasking and multi-tasking sessions to investigate the distribution of high and low interest topic categories across these sessions. The results from this analysis are described in Table 3, and highlight that users exercise distinct preferences in search sessions for high vs. low interest topics.

Our results show that multi-taskers and super-taskers pre-fer to multi-task for a large majority of their search sessions (i.e. almost always &gt; 70%), irrespective of whether they are searching for high or low interest topics. In contrast, how-ever, focused users prefer to search for high interest topics in single-tasking sessions (i.e. 59% of the time), and low in-terest topics in multi-tasking sessions (i.e. 54% of the time).
We illustrate in this paper how a shift of focus from the idea of a search session to a search task raises a number of important questions. The most important of these is about fully characterizing the extent and underlying het-erogeneities surrounding single-task and multi-task search sessions. While we draw on previous work as well as our own set of analyses to show that multi-tasking within a search session is fairly common, we also emphasize that the ex-tent and nature of multi-tasking is strongly influenced by user dispositions (i.e. whether a user is naturally disposed to single vs. multi-tasking), topic preferences (i.e. users might prefer to multi-task when searching for certain top-ics than others), and interest preferences (i.e. users might prefer to multi-task about topics they are more or less inter-ested in. Our findings have implications for understanding user preferences which in turn could impact the design of better personalization services for searchers.
Note that this is different from the identification of top top-ics in the previous section which were identified at a session-level and not at a user-level.
