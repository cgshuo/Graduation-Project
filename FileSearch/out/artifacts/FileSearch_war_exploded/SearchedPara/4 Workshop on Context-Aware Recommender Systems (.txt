 CARS 201 2 builds upon the success of the three previous editions held in conjunction with the 3rd to 5th ACM Conferences on Recommender Systems from 2009 to 2011. The 1st CARS Wor k-shop was held in New York, NY, USA , whereas Barcelona, Spain, was home of the 2nd CARS Workshop in 2010 . In 2011, the 3rd CARS workshop was held in Chicago, IL, USA.

 Recommender systems, context -aware systems, contextual info r-mation, context modeling. The importance of contextual information has been recognized by researchers and practitioners in many disciplines, including e -commerce personalization, information retrieval, ubiquitous and mobile computing, data mining, marketing, and management. While a substantial amount of research has already been per-formed in the area of recommender systems, the vast majority of existing approaches focuses on recommending the most relevant items to users and does not take into account any additional co n-textual information, such as time, location, weather, or the co m-pany of other people. Therefore, this workshop aims to bring together researchers with wide -ranging backgrounds to identify important research questions, to exchange ideas from different research disciplines, and, more generally, to facilitate discussion
