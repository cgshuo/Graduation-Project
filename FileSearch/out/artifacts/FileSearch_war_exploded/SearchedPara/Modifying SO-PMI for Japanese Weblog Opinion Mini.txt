 araki@media.eng.hokudai.ac.jp Recently, more and more websites add information in the form of personal opinions to the Web, e.g. customer reviews of products, forums, discussion groups, and blogs. Here, we use the term Weblog for these sites. This type of information is often useful. However, we have to deal with an enormous amount of unstructured and/or semi-structured data. These data are subjective, in free format and mostly tex-tual, thus using them is difficult and time consum-ing. Therefore, how to mine the Weblog opinions automatically more effectively has attracted more and more attention (Gamon, 2005; Popescu, 2005; Chaovalit, 2005).

Turney (2002) has presented an unsupervised opinion classification algorithm called SO-PMI (Se-mantic Orientation Using Pointwise Mutual Infor-mation). The main use of SO-PMI is to estimate the semantic orientation (i.e. positive or negative) of a phrase by measuring the hits returned from a search engine of pairs of words or phrases, based on the mutual information theory. This approach has previously been successfully used on English. The average accuracy was 74% when evaluated on 410
However, according to our preliminary experi-ment, directly translating Turney X  X  original idea into Japanese gave a very slanted result, with a positive accuracy of 95% and a negative accuracy of only 8%. We found that the balance between the posi-tive and negative sides is influenced greatly by the page hits of reference words/sets, since a search en-gine is used. Therefore, we introduced a balancing factor according for the difference in occurrence be-tween positive and negative words. And then we added several threshold rules to detect neutral ex-pressions. The proposed approach is evaluated on 200 positive and 200 negative Japanese opinion sen-tences and yielded a well-balanced result.
 In the remainder of this paper, we review the SO-PMI Algorithm in Section 2, then adapt the SO-PMI for Japanese and present the modifications in Sec-tion 3. In section 4, we evaluate and discuss the experimental results. Section 5 gives concluding re-marks. The SO-PMI algorithm (Turney, 2002) is used to es-timate the semantic orientation (SO) of a phrase by measuring the similarity of pairs of words or phrases using the following formula:
The reference words  X  X xcellent X  and  X  X oor X  are used, thus SO is positive when a phrase is more strongly associated with  X  X xcellent X  and negative when a phrase is more strongly associated with  X  X oor X . Let hits(query) be the number of hits re-turned when using a search engine, the following estimate of SO can be derived from Formula (2) and (1) with some minor algebraic manipulation.
 has a NEAR operator. This operator constrains the search to documents that contain the words within ten words of one another, in either order. Turney X  X  previous work has shown that NEAR performs bet-ter than AND when measuring the strength of se-mantic association between words. The first step of our approach is to extract opin-ion phrases using word POS (part of speech) tem-plates based on our analysis of opinions in Japanese Weblog and the results of related work (Kobayashi, 2003; Taku, 2002; Wang, 2006). The second step is to estimate the semantic orientation of the extracted phrases, using the SO-PMI algorithm. 3.1 Adapting SO-PMI for Japanese Following Turney X  X  original idea, we first translated the SO formula to the one shown in Formula (4) for Japanese.
 hits(query) even though Google does not have a NEAR operator. The AltaVista NEAR operator does not work well for Japanese and Google indexes more pages than AltaVista, thus we used Google and re-placed the NEAR operator with the AND operator in the SO formula.  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  and  X   X  X  X   X  were se-lected because they correspond to the English words  X  X xcellent X  and  X  X oor X .

For testing the performance of this trial, we used 200 positive and 200 negative Japanese opinion sen-tences which have been labeled by hand. The re-sults were very slanted. Many phrases, whether pos-itive or negative in meaning, still received a posi-tive SO. Some possible causes could be that  X   X  X  X  (poor) X  has more hits than  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (excellent) X , as shown in Table 1, and that the AND operator is less useful than the NEAR operator. 3.2 Modifying SO-PMI for Japanese In Japanese, there are many expressions when people evaluate something. For example,  X   X  X  X  (good) X ,  X   X  X  (good) X ,  X   X  X  (satisfaction) X  ,  X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  (excellent) X  are usually used when some-one wants to convey a positive opinion. Hence we tried to replace the reference words  X  X xcellent X  and  X  X oor X  with two reference sets:  X  p  X  basic  X  and  X  n  X  basic  X :  X  p  X  basic  X  is a set of common strong positive words in Japanese.  X  n  X  basic  X  is a set of common weak negative words. The hit counts of these words from Google is shown in Table 1 (All data from 2007/01/12). The hits(query) was calculated by hits(phrase AND ( X   X  X  X  (good) X  OR  X   X  X  X  (like) X ) OR  X   X  X  (good) X  OR ...) .

We evaluated this modification using the same data as in Section 3.1. We obtained a slightly bet-ter result. However the SO values were still slanted. This time many phrases, whether positive or nega-tive in meaning, still received a negative SO. All of these test results are shown in detail in Section 4.2.
In the experiments above, we obtained heavily slanted results. We consider that the large differ-ence in page hits between the positive and negative reference words/sets are the main cause for this phe-nomenon. To mitigate this problem, we decided to introduce a balancing factor to adjust the balance be-tween the positive and negative sides. The SO for-mula was modified from (5) to (6).

The balancing factor f (  X  ) was calculated by For-mula (7).
The log 2 of  X  p  X  basic  X  and  X  n  X  basic  X  is a fac-tor that adjusts the balance of the similarity of  X  p  X  basic  X / X  n  X  basic  X  and phrases automatically by the hits of  X  p  X  basic  X / X  n  X  basic  X  itself.  X  is a weight value. We evaluated different values of  X  from  X 0.0 X  to  X 1.0 X  on the benchmark dataset, which is shown in detail in Section 4.2.

From these preliminary trials, we also found that many neutral phrases often receive positive or neg-ative SO. Therefore we added detection of neu-tral expressions. The idea is that if the phrase is strongly or faintly associated with both  X  p  X  basic  X  and  X  n  X  basic  X , it is considered a neutral phrase. Be-cause this means that this phrase has an ambiguous connection with both  X  p  X  basic  X  and  X  n  X  basic  X . We use the following rules (Figure 1) to separate neutral phrases from positive/negative phrases. The thresh-old values ta, tb and tc are obtained from a small, hand-labeled corpus.
Figure 1: Rules for Detecting Neutral Expressions 4.1 Gold Standard and Evaluation Metrics As a gold standard, we collected a benchmark dataset which has 200 positive opinion sentences and 200 negative opinion sentences from the reviews about Electronic Dictionary and MP3 Player prod-ucts that have been labeled as either positive or neg-the largest Japanese Weblog specializing in product comparison of consumer goods, including price and user opinions, etc. Lots of people exchange mis-cellaneous product information and reviews. These reviews are classified as questions, positive re-views, negative reviews, rumors, sale information or  X  X ther X  category.

To classify a sentence as positive (P) or negative (N), the average SO of the phrases in the sentence is used. If the average SO is P, the sentence is a posi-tive sentence; otherwise it is a negative sentence. As evaluation metrics, we measured our proposed ap-proach X  X  performance by accuracy . accuracy was measured as the number of sentences correctly clas-sified as P/N sentences to the total number of P/N sentences in the benchmark dataset (200). PA means positive accuracy , NA means negative accuracy , i.e. the accuracy on only positive or negative sentences respectively. 4.2 Experiments and Results First we did the balancing factor experiment to determine the value of  X   X   X , using the benchmark dataset. The results are shown in Figure 2. (a) and (b) show the dashed line indicates average ac-curacy (74%) on English Data from Turney X  X  Study (2002). Turney didn X  X  evaluate positive and nega-tive accuracy respectively. The full drawn line indi-cates the result after translating the original SO-PMI to Japanese (PA:95%, NA: 8%). PA series (the line with triangle mark)/ NA series (the line with circle mark) when values of  X   X   X  from  X 0.0 X  to  X 1.0 X  were used.
 Changing the  X  tends to be a tradeoff, lowering PA when NA is improved and vice versa. There-fore, we used Harmonic  X  Mean by the following formula to find a proper value of  X   X   X .
 Figure 2, (c) shows PA , NA and Harmonic  X  Mean curves for different values  X  in Balance Factor of  X   X   X . We selected the  X   X  =0.9 X  giving the highest Harmonic  X  Mean value, thus giving a good balance between PA (75%) and NA (70%).
 The comparative experiment results between the SO-PMI for Japanese (Test 1), and our modifications (Test 2, 3, 4) are shown in Table 2.

In Test 1 and 2, we obtained extreme results, lean-ing to the positive or negative end, whether using the Turney X  X  original approach or expanding the refer-ence word as  X  p  X  basic  X  and  X  n  X  basic  X . In Test 3, we added a balancing factor as described in section 3.2, and obtained a comparatively well-balanced re-sult. Finally, after adding the neutral expressions de-tection, we achieved a PA of 78% and NA of 72% (Test 4). The balance between positive and negative sides was quite improved by contrast with Test 1 and 2. This study first proposed a modified unsupervised approach (SO-PMI) for Japanese Weblog Opinion Mining. Some parts of Turney X  X  approach, such as the NEAR operator, does not work for Japanese, thus some modifications must be done. In a prelim-inary experiment, the negative accuracy (8%) was very poor while the positive accuracy (95%) was high. To deal with this phenomenon, we presented three modifications based on the characteristics of Japanese and the results of related work. The ex-periment results ( positive accuracy : 78%, negative accuracy : 72%) show that our proposal achieved a considerably improved performance, comparing with directly translating the SO-PMI. Hence it would be expected that the balancing factor and neu-tral expressions detection would work effectively also for other reference words or languages. In the future, we will evaluate different choices of words for the sets of positive and negative reference words. We also plan to appraise our proposal on other lan-guages.
