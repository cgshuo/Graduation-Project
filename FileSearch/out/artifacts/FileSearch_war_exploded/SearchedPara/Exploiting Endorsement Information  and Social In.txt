 Social networking services posse ss two features: (1) capturing the social relationships among people, re presented by the social network, and (2) allowing users to express their preferences on different kinds of items (e.g. photo, celebrity, pages) through endorsing buttons, represented by a kind of endorsement bipartite graph. In this work, using such information, we propose a novel recommendation method, which leverages the viral marketi ng in the social network and the wisdom of crowds from endorsement network. Our recommendation consists of two parts. First, given some query terms describing user X  X  preference, we find a set of ta rgeted influencers who have the maximum activation probability on those nodes related to the query terms in the social network. Second, based on the derived targeted influencers as key experts, we recommend items via the endorsement network. We conduct the experiments on DBLP co-authorship social network with author-reference data as the endorsement network. The results show our method can achieve effective recommendations. In current social networking serv ices (SNS), like Facebook and Twitter, an important characteristic is allowing users to express their favorites on different kinds of items by endorsing them. For example, in Facebook, users can  X  X ike X  pages, photos, celebrities, videos, and etc. In Twitter, users utilize  X  X avorite X  or  X  X etweet X  to show their preferences. Such endorsement information between users and items can be regarded as a kind of novel source for recommendation. A recent study on such endorsing data is to recommend items which not only relate to the user-given query of tags but also share a significant number of common endorsers [2]. However, in their proposal, they assume individuals in SNS are independent with each other. The social relationships (e.g. friendshi ps) among users, which capture the knowledge about how people interact among different items, are ignored. Some studies use user-ite m interactions for recommendation. I. Konstas et al. [1] and I. Guy et al. [4] propose diverse modeling approaches to represent the interactions among users, items, and tags as a unified graph and perform different random walk-based methods to recommend items for specific users. On the other hand, in SNS, social network is a crucial medium for the spreading of influence and information. People who adopt a new idea or buy a new item could be affected by the trusts and decisions of their friends. Kempt et al. [3] investigate the behaviors of information diffusion and the word-of-mouth effect. They try to find influential individuals who can trigger maximum cascades of influence in a network, for viral marketing . In this work, we propose a novel recommender system, which use the endorsement information and the influence propagation in a social network. Our central idea is to find topical influencers as the recommenders to recommend items via the endorsement information. Specifically, given query terms describing user X  X  preference, we aim to find some individuals (termed targeted influencers ) who have maximum influence potentials on so me persons related to the query. We regard these targeted influencers as authoritative roles w.r.t. user X  X  interests. And then using the endorsing information, we recommend the items which are commonly and effectively endorsed by the targeted influencers. Our method has two characteristics: (1) recommending items by the targeted influencers can be more explainable and convincing. (2) The social endorsement is a kind of the wisdom of crowds, and thus recommendation combining targeted influencers and such endorsing information can be regarded as crowdsourcing from key players. Preliminary. First, the input of our recommendation is a set of query terms which represents user X  X  preferences. The set of nodes whose interests satisfy the query terms is denoted by  X  . Second, we represent the relationships among users in a SNS as a social network  X  X   X  X , X , X  X  , where  X  is the user set,  X  is the set of relationships between users, and each edge is associated with an influence probability  X   X   X , X   X   X  X  X 0,1 X  as weight. Each node  X  is associated with a set of labels  X   X  describing his/her preferences. Third, we formulate the endorsement information as a bipartite graph  X , X , X  X  X  X  X   X  is the user set,  X  is the item set, and  X   X  is the set of endorsing edges. Fourth, we propose the Collective Influence ( CI ) model for query-based influence propagation in a social network. The CI model starts from an initial set of active nodes  X   X  , and proceeds by the following rules in discrete time rounds. In round  X  , each active node  X  has a single chance to activate each of its active or inactive neighbors  X  with the pre-determined influence probability  X   X   X , X   X  . If  X  successfully activates  X  and  X  is inactive,  X  will become active at round  X 1 X  X  X  X  . If  X  successfully activates  X  and  X  is active,  X  will keep active at round  X 1 X  X  X  X  . This procedure will be terminated until no activations are possible. Fifth, given a source node  X  X  X  as a candidate targeted influencer, and a target node  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  , we define the propagation path  X   X  X  X  X   X   X   X  X  X   X   X ,  X   X ,...,  X   X ,  X   X ,...,  X  are active, as the highest probabilistic path from source  X  to target  X  . We also define the activation probability  X  X   X   X , X   X   X   X   X  X  X   X   X ,  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X  as the chance that  X  successfully affects  X  . If  X  and  X  are disconnected,  X  X   X   X , X   X   X 0 . In addition, for the set of nodes with query terms  X  and the set of candidate targeted influencers  X  , we define the average activation probability as Problem Statement. Given (a) a social network  X  , (b) a set of nodes with query terms:  X  , (c) the endorsement bipartite network  X  X   X , X , X  X   X   X  , and (d) the number of targeted influencers  X  number of recommended items  X   X  , using the proposed Collective Influence model, we aim to (1) find a set of  X   X  targeted influencers  X  in  X  such that the objective function of average activat ion probability  X   X   X , X   X  is maximized. (2) Recommend a ranked list of  X  based on the set of targeted influencers  X  . Finding Targeted Influencers. This part contains two stages: (1) grouping nodes based on query terms, and (2) a greedy method to maximize the objective function for finding targeted influencers. We first assume nodes with query terms form several components in the social network. We identify such small groups, where each group contains only nodes with query terms, and obtain the corresponding induced subgraphs  X  X   X   X   X ,  X   X   X  X ,...,  X   X  , where m is the number of groups. This grouping will reduce the graph space and allow the search to be more efficiently. And then our goal is to distribute the set  X  nodes S as targeted influencers over these m subgraphs such that the determination of k s nodes can maximize the average activation probability  X   X   X , X   X  . We first explain our objective  X   X   X , X   X  satisfies the submodularity property, and then use such property to devise a greedy algorithm to maximize  X   X   X , X   X  . First, R is nondecreasing  X  X , X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X , X  X  X  : adding a node to a set will not decrease R . Second, R is submodular (i.e., satisfies the diminishing returns)  X   X   X  X , X   X   X   X   X   X  X  X  X  X , X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X , X   X   X   X   X   X  than or equal to the marginal gain of adding v to X  X  X  superset Y (  X  X  X  ) for any nodes v  X  V \ Y . That is, let  X   X   X , X   X   X 0 in the initial state, in  X   X  X  X  round, a targeted influencer v is determined and added into the set S t , the marginal gain of the average activation probability round  X   X   X , X   X  X  X   X   X   X   X   X   X , X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X   X  , where  X   X   X  X  To find the set of targeted influencers S , we use the submodularity to devise a greedy algorithm. The algorithm starts from initializing the set  X   X   X  X  X  , and then iteratively adds a node s into S  X   X  X  X  round (  X  &gt;0) such that s maximizes the marginal gain The greedy algorithm will cont inue to add nodes into S where we reach the budget of selecting targeted influencers. Item Recommendation. Based on the derived targeted influencers, we use the Random Walk with Restart algorithm ( RWR ) [5] in the endorsement bipartite graph for the item recommendation. RWR is capable of predicting the preferen ce or affinity of items for some indicated users. We set the targeted influencers as the designated restarting nodes and apply RWR to compute the proximity scores for all items in the bipartite graph. The restarting probability is set to 0.25 in this work. A ranked list with  X   X  items of highest scores will be returned as the recommended items. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compile the DBLP bibliography data to a co nnected co-authorship social network containing 5,095 nodes and 11,800 edges in some premier conferences, including SIGIR, WWW, CIKM, WSDM, JCDL, KDD, ICDM, SDM, PAKDD, PKDD, VLDB, SIGMOD, and ICDE. The edges are constructed if two authors co-work more than 3 papers. The occurring in at least 3 paper titles that he/she ever participated. And the probabilistic weights on edges are determined by  X  X  X  X , X  X  X  |  X   X   X  X   X  |  X | X  min  X   X |,|  X  | X   X  . For the endorsement network, it consists of authors and papers as nodes. If an author v ever referenced to a 18,357 nodes and 147,392 papers. Note that we only include the papers occur in mentioned conferen ces. We also compile two sets of query terms from two areas: information retrieval (IR-Query) and social network (SN-Query). For each query set, we manually find 20 authors as testing influencers, where each author must publish at least 5 related papers and serve as PC in at least 5 proceedings of our used conferences. The details about the queries are shown in Table 1. The first experiment is computin g the average activation probability  X  X , X  X  X  for the proposed method of finding targeted influencers  X  (  X  is varied from 1 to 20.). We compare our method to the random selection as baseline and three heuristic methods: degree, closeness, and betweenness centralities, which aim to find different kinds of important nodes in a social network. The experimental results are shown in Figure 1. We can find our method outperforms the other five heuristics for both IR-Query and SN-Query. Table 1. Query terms and testing authors for IR and SN queries. The second experiment is to test whether the top-k recommended papers are referenced by compiled productive authors. We define an accuracy measure author hit rate  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  where  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  is the number of authors referencing to any of compare our method with the approach of pure Random Walk with Restart [5] considering all nodes wi th query terms as the restarting ones. We set  X   X  =10 and  X   X  =10. The experimental results are shown in Figure 2. For IR-query, we can find ours outperforms the RandomWalk approach as the  X   X  increases. This implies ours provides influential recommendations in IR domain. For SN-query, we find the effectiveness of ours is more distinguished over all k returned. After studying the recommended papers (that is not shown here for space limit), we find that ours precisely suggest social-networked papers while pure RandomWa lk is prone to return papers that mix the areas of social network and sensor network mining. We develop a novel recommender, which exploits the information of social and endorsement networks. The central idea is to leverage the concepts of viral marketing and the wisdom of crowds for item recommendation. We devise a greedy method which maximizes a submodular objective function to find the targeted influencers who can effectively activate nodes with query terms in the social network. And then we use the random walk mechanism to recommend items based on the targeted influencers in the endorsement network. Evaluations on academic data show promising results.
