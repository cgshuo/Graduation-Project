 Advanced manufacturing such as aerospace, semi-conductor, and flat display device often involves complex production processes, and generates large volume of production data. In general, the production data comes from products with different levels of quality, assembly line with complex flows and equipments, and processing craft with massive control-ling parameters. The scale and complexity of data is be-yond the analytic power of traditional IT infrastructures. To achieve better manufacturing performance, it is imperative to explore the underlying dependencies of the production data and exploit analytic insights to improve the production process. However, few research and industrial efforts have been reported on providing manufacturers with integrated data analytical solutions to reveal potentials and optimize the production process from data-driven perspectives.
In this paper, we design, implement and deploy an inte-grated solution, named PDP-Miner , which is a data analyt-ics platform customized for process optimization in Plasma Display Panel (PDP) manufacturing. The system utilizes the latest advances in data mining technologies and Big Data infrastructures to create a complete analytical solu-tion. Besides, our proposed system is capable of supporting automatically configuring and scheduling analysis tasks, and balancing heterogeneous computing resources. The system and the analytic strategies can be applied to other advanced manufacturing fields to enable complex data analysis tasks. Since 2013, PDP-Miner has been deployed as the data analy-sis platform of ChangHong COC 1 . By taking the advantages of our system, the overall PDP yield rate has increased from 91% to 94%.

The manufacturing industry involves the production of merchandise for use or sale using labor and machines, tools, chemical processing, etc. It has been the mainstay of many developed economies and remains an important driver of GDP (Gross Domestic Product). According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis data, every dollar goods in manu-facturing generates $1.48 in economic activity, the highest economic multiplier among major economic sector 3 . With the advancement of new technologies, a lot of manufactur-ers utilize cutting-edge materials and emerging capabilities enabled by physical, biological, chemical and computer sci-ences. The improved manufacturing process often refers to as  X  X dvanced manufacturing X  [14, 28]. For example, orga-nizations in oil and gas industry apply new technologies to transform raw data into actionable insight to improve asset value and product yield while enhancing safety and protect-ing the environment.

In advanced manufacturing, a medium-sized or large man-ufacturing sector often arranges complex and elaborate pro-duction processes according to the product structure, and generates large volume of production data collected by sen-sor technologies [8], Manufacturing Execution System (MES) [13], and Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) [22]. In practice, the production data contains intricate dependen-cies among a tremendous amount of controlling parameters in the production workflow. Generally, it is extremely dif-ficult or even impossible for analysts to manually explore such dependencies, let alone proposing strategies to poten-tially optimize the workflow.

Fortunately, the use of data analytics offers the manufac-turers great opportunities to acquire informative messages http://articles.e-works.net.cn/mes/article113579.htm.

Application Gap towards optimizing the production workflow. However in practice, there is a significant application gap between manufacturers and data analysts in observing the data and using automation tools. Table 1 highlights the perspective difference between manufacturers and analysts on three im-portant aspects: (1) Capacity , i.e. what the data looks like; (2) Capability , i.e., how the data can be utilized; and (3) Knowledge , i.e., how to perform knowledge discovery and management.

To bridge the gap, it is imperative to provide automated tools to the manufacturers to enhance their capability of an-alyzing production data. Data analytics in advanced man-ufacturing, especially data mining approaches, have been targeting several important fields, such as product qual-ity analysis [20, 26], failure analysis of production [3, 25], production planning and scheduling analysis [1, 2], analytic platform implementation [7, 8], etc. However, few research and industrial efforts have been reported on providing man-ufacturers with an integrated data analytical platform , to enable automatic analysis of the production data and ef-ficient optimization of the production process. Our goal is to provide such a solution to practically fill the gap.
Plasma Display Panel (PDP) manufacturing produces over 10,000 panels for a daily throughput in ChangHong COC Display Devices Co., Ltd (COC for short). The produc-tion line is near 6,000 meters and the process contains 75 assembling routines, and 279 major production equipments with more than 10,000 parameters. The average produc-tion time throughout the manufacturing process requires 76 hours. Specifically, the workflow consists of three major pro-cedures shown in Figure 1, i.e., front panel , rear panel , and panel assembly . Each procedure contains multiple sequen-tially executed flows, and each flow is composed of multiple key routines. The first two procedures are executed in paral-lel, and each pair of front and rear panels will be assembled in the assembly procedure. Figure 2 depicts the real assem-bly line of one routine (Tin-doped Indium Oxide, ITO) in front panel procedure, which gives us a sense of how complex the complete production process will be.

There are 83 types of equipments in the PDP manufactur-ing process, each of which has a different set of parameters to fulfill the corresponding processing tasks. The parameters are often preset to certain values to ensure the normal oper-ation of each equipment. However, the observed parameter values often deviate from the preset values. Further in the production environment, external factors, e.g., temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, may potentially affect
Front Panel Processing Rear Panel Processing Figure 1: PDP Manufacturing Production Flow.

Figure 2: An Example Routine in PDP Workflow. the product quality as the raw materials and equipments are sensitive to these factors. The observed values of external factors vary significantly in terms of sensor locations and acquisition time. The production process generates a huge amount of production data (10 Gigabytes per day with 30 Million records).

In daily operations, the manufactures are concerned with how to improve the yield rate of the production. To achieve this goal, several questions need to be carefully addressed, including
Answering these questions, however, is a non-trivial task due to the scale and complexity of the production data, and is impossible for domain analysts to manually explore the data. Hence, it is necessary to automate the optimization process using appropriate infrastructural and algorithmic so-lutions.
The massive production data poses great challenges to manufacturers in effectively optimizing the production work-flow. During the past two years, we have been working closely with the technicians and engineers from COC to in-vestigate data-driven techniques for improving the yield rate of production. During this process, we have identified two key challenges and proposed the corresponding solutions to each challenge as follows.

In general, highly automatic production process often gen-erates large volume of data, containing a myriad of con-trolling parameters with the corresponding observed values. The parameters may have malformed or missing values due to inaccurate sensing or transmission. Therefore, it is cru-cial to efficiently store and preprocess these data, in order to handle the increasing scale as well as the incomplete sta-tus of the data. In addition, the analytics of the production data is a cognitive activity towards the production workflow, which embodies an iterative process of exploring the data, analyzing the data, and representing the insights. A practi-cal system should provide an integrated and high-efficiency solution to support the process.

Challenge 1. Facing the enormous data with sustained growth, how to efficiently support large-scale data analysis tasks and provide prompt guidance to different routines in the workflow?
Existing data mining products, such as Weka [9], SPSS and SQL Sever Data Tools, provide functionalities to facil-itate users to conduct the analysis. However, these prod-ucts are designed for small or medium scale data analysis, and hence cannot be applied to our problem setting. To address Challenge 1 , we design and implement an inte-grated Data Analytics Platform based on a distributed sys-tem ( FIU-Miner ) [32] to support high-performance analy-sis. The platform manages all the production data in a dis-tributed environment, which is capable of configuring and executing data preprocessing and data analysis tasks in an automatic way. The platform has the following functionali-ties: (1) cross-language data mining algorithms integration, (2) real-time monitoring of system resource consumption, and (3) balancing the node workload in clusters.

Besides Challenge 1 , in advanced manufacturing, the controlling parameters in the production workflow may cor-relate with each other, and potentially affect the production yield rate. Several analysis tasks identified by PDP analysts include (1) discovering the most related parameters ( Task 1 ); (2) quantifying the parameter correlation with the prod-uct quality ( Task 2 ); and (3) proposing novel parameter recipes (i.e., parameter value combinations) to improve the yield rate ( Task 3 ). A reasonable way to effectively fulfill these tasks is to utilize suitable data mining and machine learning techniques. However, existing algorithms cannot be directly applied to these tasks, as they may either lack the capability of handling large-scale data, or fail to consider domain-specific data characteristics.

Challenge 2. Facing various types of mining require-ments, how to effectively adapt existing algorithms for cus-tomized analysis tasks that comprehensively consider the do-main characteristics?
In our proposed system, Challenge 2 is effectively tack-led by developing appropriate data mining algorithms and adapting them to the problem of analyzing the manufactur-ing data. In particular, to address Task 1 , we propose an ensemble feature selection method to generate a stable pa-rameter set based on the results of various feature selection methods. To address Task 2 , we utilize regression mod-els to describe the relationship between product quality and various parameters. To address Task 3 , we apply associ-ation based methods to identify possible feature combina-tions that can significantly improve the quality of product. To make the system an integrated solution, we also provide the functionalities of data exploration (including compara-tive analysis and data cube) and result management.
Our proposed solution, PDP-Miner , is essentially a scal-able, easy-to-use and customized data analysis system for large-scale and complex mining tasks on manufacturing data. Exploitation of the latest advances in data mining and ma-chine learning technologies unleashes the potential to achieve three critical objectives, including enhancing exploration and production , improving refining and manufacturing efficiency , and optimizing global operations . Since 2013, PDP-Miner has been deployed as the production data analysis platform of COC. By using our system, the overall yield rate has in-creased from 91% to 94%, which has brought more than 117 million RMB of revenue per year 4 .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of our proposed system, starting from introducing the system architecture, followed by the details of three interleaved analysis modules, including data explo-ration, operational analysis and result representation. In Section 3, we explore possible feature selection strategies to identify pivotal parameters in the production process, and propose an ensemble feature selection approach to obtain robust yet predominant parameter set. In Section 4, we dis-cuss the task of measuring the importance of parameters, and utilize regression models to examine how the param-eter change will affect the yield rate. Section 5 describes our strategy of mining the knowledge of data, that is, to employ discriminative analysis (e.g., association mining) to reveal the dependencies of parameters. Section 6 represents the system deployment, in which system performance eval-uation is described and some important real findings are presented. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper.
The overall architecture of PDP-Miner is shown in Fig-ure 3. The system, from bottom to top, consists of two com-ponents: Data Analytics Platform (including Task Manage-ment Layer and Physical Resource Layer ) and Data Analysis Modules .

Data Analytics Platform provides a fast, integrated, and user-friendly system for data mining in distributed environ-ment, where all the data analysis tasks accomplished by Data Analysis Modules are configured as workflows and also automatically scheduled. Details of this module are provided in Section 2.1.

Data Analysis Modules provide data-mining solutions and methodologies to identify important production factors, in-http://articles.e-works.net.cn/mes/article113579.htm cluding controlling parameters and their underlying correla-tions, in order to optimize production process. These meth-ods are incorporated into the platform as functions and mod-ules towards specific analysis tasks. In PDP-Miner , there are 3 major analytic modules: data exploration , data analysis , and result management . In Section 2.2, more details are pro-vided by presenting our data mining solutions customized for PDP production data. A sample system for demon-stration purpose is available at http://bigdata-node01. cs.fiu.edu/PDP-Miner/demo.html .

Traditional data-mining tools or existing products [9, 21, 19, 18, 23, 30] have three major limitations when applied to specific industrial sectors or production process analysis: 1) They support neither large-scale data analysis nor handy algorithm plug-in; 2) They require advanced programming skills when configuring and integrating algorithms for com-plex data mining tasks; and 3) They do not support large scale of analysis tasks running simultaneously in heteroge-neous environments.

To address the limitations of existing products, we develop the data analytic platform based on our previous large-scale data mining system, FIU-Miner [32], to facilitate the exe-cution of data mining tasks. The data analytic platform provides a set of novel functionalities with the following sig-nificant advantages [32]:
The Comparison Analysis and Data Cube are capable of assisting data analysts to explore PDP operation data effi-ciently and effectively.

Comparison Analysis Comparison Analysis , shown in Figure 6(a), provides a set of tools to help data analysts quickly identify parameters whose values are statistically dif-ferent between two datasets according to several statistical indicators. Comparison Analysis is able to extract the top-k most significant parameters based on predefined indicators or customized ranking criteria. It also supports comparison on the same set of parameters over two different datasets to identify the top-k most representative parameters of two specified datasets.

Data Cube Data Cube , shown in Figure 6(b), provides a convenient approach to explore high dimensional data so that data analysts can have a glance at the characteristics of the dataset. In addition, Data Cube can conduct multi-level inspection of the data by applying OLAP techniques. Data analysts can customize a multi-dimensional cube over the original data. Thus, the constructed data cubes allow users to explore multiple dimensional data at different granulari-ties and evaluate the data using pre-defined measurements.
The data mining approaches in algorithm library can be organized as a configurable procedure in Operation Panel , as shown in Figure 6(c). The Operation Panel is a unified interface to build a workflow for executing such task auto-matically. The Operation Panel contains the following three main tasks:
Important Parameter Selection By modeling the important parameter discovery task as a feature selection problem, several feature selection algorithms are implemented adaptively based on the production data. Moreover, an ad-vanced ensemble framework is designed to combine multiple feature selection outputs. Based on these implementations, the system is able to generate a list of important parameters, shown in Figure 6(d).
Regression Analysis The purpose of Regression Anal-ysis (shown in Figure 6(f)) is to discover the correlations between the yield rate and the controlling parameters. The regression model not only indicates whether a correlation exists between a parameter and the yield rate but also quan-tifies the extent that the change of the parameter value will influence the yield rate.
 Discriminative Analysis Discriminative analysis (See Figure 6(e)) is an alternative approach to identify the fea-ture values that have strong indication to the target labels (panel grade). By grouping and leveraging the features of individual panels, this approach is able to find the most dis-criminative rules (a set of features with the values) to the target labels according to the data.
 Figure 4: A Sample Workflow for PDP Manufactur-ing Data Analysis.

To illustrate how Data Analysis Modules are incorporated with the Data Analytics Platform , Figure 4 illustrates two example analytic tasks wrapped as two workflows. As shown, Workflow 1 indicates an analysis procedure of building re-gression models with selected important parameters; Work-flow 2 indicates another procedure of identifying reasonable parameter value combinations based on previously selected parameters. The Operation Panel provides a user-friendly interface shown in Figure 5 to facilitate workflow assembly and configuration. Users only need to explicitly create tasks dependencies before the workflow executing automatically by our platform.

Figure 5: Data Analysis Workflow Configuration. types: the important parameter list, the parameter value combinations, and the regression model. Templates are de-signed to support automatically storage, update, and re-trieval of discovered patterns. Results are recorded based on analysis tasks and can be organized in terms of important equipment, top parameters, and task list. For each result, corresponding domain experts can refine and give feedback, shown in Figure 6(h). In addition, visualizations are pro-vided to summarize the analytic results, collected feedbacks, and status of current knowledge (shown in Figure 6(g)). It provides a flexible interface for maintaining domain knowl-edge very efficiently.
In manufacturing management, the primary goal is to im-prove the yield rate of products by optimizing the manu-facturing workflow. To this end, one important question is to identify the key parameters (features) in the workflow, which can significantly differentiate qualified products from defective ones. However, it is a non-trivial task to select a subset of features from the huge feature space. To tackle this problem, we initially experimented several widely used fea-ture selection approaches. Specifically, we use Information Gain [10], mRMR [5] and ReliefF [24] to perform parameter selection. Figure 7 shows the top 10 selected features by these three algorithms on a sampled PDP dataset.

As observed in Figure 7, the three feature subsets share only one common feature ( X  X har 020101-008 X ). Such a phe-nomenon indicates the instability of feature selection meth-ods, as it is difficult to identify the importance of a feature from a mixed view of feature subsets. In general, the se-lected are the most relevant to the labels and less redundant to each other based on certain criteria. However, the corre-lated features may be ignored if we select a small subset of features. In terms of knowledge discovery, the selected fea-ture subset is insufficient to represent important knowledge about redundant features. Further, different algorithms se-lect features based on different criteria, which renders the feature selection result instable. Figure 7: Selected Features by Different Algorithms.
The stability issue of feature selection has been studied re-cently [4, 12] under the assumption of small sample size. The results of these work indicate that different algorithms with equal classification performance may have a wide variance in terms of stability. Another direction of stable feature se-lection involves exploring the consensus information among different feature groups [17, 29, 31], which first identifies con-sensus feature groups for a given dataset, and then performs selection from the feature groups. However, these methods fail to consider the correlation between selected features and unselected ones, which might be important to guide us for feature selection.
In our system, inspired by ensemble clustering [27, 15], we employ the ensemble strategy on the results of various feature selection methods to maintain the robustness and stability of feature selection. The problem setting of stable feature selection is defined as follows. Given a dataset with M features, we employ N feature selection methods which for an arbitrary feature i return a N -lengthed vector y i 1 , 2 ,...,M . Each entry of y i is 1 or 0 indicating whether the feature i is selected or not by the corresponding feature selection method. Since we are concerned with whether to select a feature or not, we assume a feature i , in the form of results of N feature selection methods, y i , is generated from a mixture of two multivariate components, indicating selected features and unselected features, i.e., where  X  j denotes the mixture probability of j -th component parameterized by  X  j , in which the n -th entry  X  jn means the probability of the output of n -th feature selection method equals to 1. We further assume conditional independence between feature selection methods. Therefore, As the result of a feature selection method in the vector y is either selecting (1) or not selecting (0) the feature i , the probability of the feature i being selected by the n -th feature selection method, i.e., p ( y in |  X  jn ), could be represented by a Bernoulli distribution In addition, we assume that all the features are i.i.d . Then the log-likelihood of the unified probabilistic model is To learn the parameters  X  j and  X  j ,j  X  { 1 , 2 } , we use Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. To this end, we introduce a series of hidden random variables z i ,i = 1 , 2 to indicate y i belonging to each component, i.e., the param-eters of the random variable z i 1 ,z z 2 ,z i 1 + z i 2 = 1.
The iterative procedure of EM will be terminated when the likelihood of the mixture model does not change too much constrained by a predefined threshold. The hidden variable z i indicates the probabilities of membership of fea-ture y i with respect to all mixture components. It is in some sense similar to the situation in Gaussian mixture models. The feature is assigned to the j -th component that the cor-responding value z ij is the largest in z ij ,j  X  { 1 , 2 } . As a feature selection method will eventually generate two sub-sets of features (selected or not), it is reasonable to make two mixture components.

After obtaining the assignments of features to compo-nents, say  X  ( z i ), we group features into two categories, i.e., selected/unselected. In practice, the number of selected fea-tures are significantly less than the unselected ones, and hence the features that are not selected by any feature selec-tion method are put into a large category. The features in the other category are final feature selection results. Specif-ically for each component j , we pick the features that have the membership assignment, i.e., z ij , greater than a pre-defined threshold  X  , and then put these features into the selected category. In this way, we can discard features with low probabilities for selection, and hence the stability of fea-ture selection can be achieved by assembling different feature selection results using the mixture model.
To optimize the production process, it is imperative to discover the parameters that have significant influence on the yield rate and quantify such influence. In our system, an actionable solution is to explicitly establish a relationship between controlling parameters and the yield rate, which can be achieved using regression analysis.

Formally, assume the daily observations are i.i.d . Then the relationship between features (parameters) and the yield rate can be modeled as a function f ( x , w ) with additive Gaussian noise, i.e., where y denotes the yield rate, x = ( x 1 ,  X  X  X  ,x d ) T denotes the set of features that may have impact on y , and w de-notes the weight of features. The noise term is a zero mean Gaussian random variable with precision  X  .

In our system, we implement two linear regression based models: ridge regression and lasso regression [11]. From the perspective of maximum likelihood, the linear relationship can be expressed as
For both models, we leverage least square to quantify the error, i.e., E ( w ) =
In advanced manufacturing domain, the number of fea-tures is usually large (in PDP scenario, the number of fea-tures is more than 10K), and therefore ensemble feature se-lection (described in Section 3) is applied before building the regression model. To conduct the regression, we incorporate three categories of features: 1. The parameters of the equipments involved in the man-2. The parameters of the environment, such as tempera-3. The features of the materials, such as the viscosity, After integrating all the features, we normalize each dimen-sion of the features using standardization, i.e. x  X   X  X
The linear regression can be solved efficiently. When the dataset is small, the closed form can be directly obtained, i.e.  X  w ridge = (  X  I + X T X )  X  1 X T y for ridge regression and  X  w lasso = sgn (( X T X )  X  1 X T )( | ( X T X )  X  1 X T y | X   X  ) for lasso regression, where X denotes the matrix of the features with i th row indicating the feature set x i . For large datasets, we train the model iteratively by using stochastic gradient descent for ridge regression and coordinate gradient for lasso regression.

The weights of the trained model can be intuitively in-terpreted. Firstly, the value | w i | indicates the conditional correlation between the feature x i and the yield rate given the other features. In general, a larger weight indicates a larger conditional correlation. Moreover, the corresponding p -value of each feature can be leveraged to measure the like-lihood of the correlation. The smaller the p -value, the less likely such correlation is false.

By performing regression analysis on the PDP data, we find some interesting correlations. For example: 1. The variance of the humidity of the air has positive 2. The pressure of the air has positive correlation with 3. The workshop temperature and its variance vary slightly Discriminative analysis mines the feature knowledge of the PDP panel data from a different perspective. It is used as an alternative way to reveal the underlying relationship between the features and the panel grades. Specifically, it helps discover parameter recipes as well as sets of feature values which are closely related to qualified panels and de-fective panels. In PDP-Miner , the techniques of association based classification [16] and low-support discriminative pat-tern mining [6] are leveraged to conduct the discriminative analysis.
Association based classification integrates classification and association rule mining to discover a special subset of asso-ciation rules called class association rules (CARs) . A CAR is an implication of the form { r : F  X  y } , where F is a subset of the entire feature value set and y denotes the class label (the PDP panel grade in our scenario). Each CAR is associated with support s and confidence c , indicating how many records contain F and the ratio of records containing F that are labeled as y . In general, CARs contain strong discriminative information to infer the PDP panel grades. A rule-based classifier can be built by selecting a subset of the CARs that collectively cause the least error, i. e. r ,r 2 ,...,r n  X  y .

Compared with feature selection and regression analy-sis, association based classification enables the possibility of early detection due to the unique characteristics of CARs. If CARs only refer to the features in the early manufacturing process, this method can quickly identify semi-finished yet defective panels, and prevent further resource waste.
The early detection strategy is useful in the advanced manufacturing domain, as any earlier detected bad semi-finished product can directly reduce the manufacturing cost. For the production with a large number of assembling pro-cedures, such a reduction is not trivial.
A manufacturing process could consist of hundreds of as-sembling procedures with thousands of tunning parameters. When the feature dimension is high, standard association rule based methods would become time-consuming. A na  X   X ve solution for this scenario is to increase the support thresh-old to speed up mining. However, this strategy may miss interesting low-support patterns.

To address this problem, we adapt the idea of low support pattern mining algorithm ( SMP ) [6] and integrate the algo-rithm into PDP-miner . SMP aims at mining the discrim-inative patterns by leveraging a family of anti-monotonic measures called SupMaxK . SupMaxK organizes the discrim-inative pattern set into nested layers of subsets.
Many association mining methods utilize  X  X upport X  to se-lect rules/patterns. Different from the traditional associa-tion mining, the  X  X iscriminative support X  is defined to mea-sure the quality (discriminative capability) of the rule set: where  X  is a set of parameter values, S qualified and S defective denote the  X  X upport X  of  X  over two classes, indicating whether the target panel is qualified or defective.

A na  X   X ve implementation using this measure suffers from low efficiency [6] when pruning frequent non-discriminative rules. To address this issue, a new measure  X  SupMaxK (  X  ) is introduced to help prune unrelated patterns by estimating S where |  X  | = K ,  X  is the subset of  X  . Three reasons make this measure useful: (1) SupMaxK can help select more discriminative patterns as K increases; (2) SupMaxK is a lower bound of DisS ; (3) SupMaxK is anti-monotonic.
Due to the anti-monotonic property of SupMaxK , SMP can naturally be utilized to mine the discriminative patterns whose support are low but have strong indication to the panel grades.
We evaluate our proposed system from two aspects: the system performance and the real findings. The evaluation demonstrates that our system is a practical solution for large-scale data analysis, through integrating and adapting classic data mining techniques and customizing them for spe-cific domains, particularly, advanced manufacturing.
Our system is able to perform large-scale data analysis and can be easily scale up. To demonstrate the scalability of PDP-Miner , we design a series of cluster workload balance experiments in both static and dynamic computing environ-ments. The experiments are conducted on a testbed clus-ter separated from the real production system. The cluster consists of 8 computing nodes with different computing per-formances.
 In the experiments, one frequent analysis task of PDP-Miner is created using the job configuration interface, which consists of two sequential functions, i.e., Parameter Selec-tion  X  Parameter Combination Extraction. For evaluation purpose, ten different datasets (about 30 million records) are generated by sampling from the original 1-year produc-tion datasets. The analysis task is conducted over these datasets in two types of experiments: Exp I Workload bal-ance in a static environment and Exp II Workload balance in a dynamic environment . In the following, we describe the detailed experimental plans as well as the results. Exp I : Each node in the cluster is deployed with one Worker . We configure 10 parameter selection tasks with dif-ferent running times in PDP-Miner . Each job starts at time 0 and repeats with a random interval ( &lt; 1 minutes). Figure 8 shows how our system balances the workloads based on the underlying infrastructures. The x-axis denotes the time and the y-axis denotes the average number of completed jobs for each Worker at the given moment during the task execution. Clearly, the accumulated number of completed jobs (the blue solid bars) increases linearly, whereas the amortized number of completed jobs (the white empty bars) remains stable. This shows that when the cluster remains unchanged, our system achieves a good balance of the resource utilization by properly distributing jobs. The effective distribution of jobs guarantees a full use of existing resources to maximize the throughput without incurring resource bottleneck. Figure 8: Load Balance in Static Environment.
 Exp II : To investigate the resource utilization of PDP-Miner under a dynamic environment, we initially provide four nodes (node1  X  4), each with 1 Worker , and then add the other four nodes (node5  X  8) 10 minutes later. To emu-late the nodes with different computing powers, the newly-added nodes are deployed with 2 to 5 Workers , respectively. Each Worker is restricted to use only 1 CPU core at a time, so the node deployed with more Workers can have more powerful computing resources. Figure 9 shows the number of jobs completed by each node during observing the sys-tem execution for 70 minutes. The number of jobs on each node is segmented every 10 minutes. It clearly shows that the number of completed jobs is proportional to the number of Workers on each node, which indicates that our system can balance the workloads in a dynamically changed cluster. It also demonstrates that the entire system can be linearly extended with resources of different computing power.
Figure 9: Load Balance in Dynamic Environment.
PDP-Miner has been playing an important role on reveal-ing deeper and finer relations behind big data in COC X  X  real practice. As an example, WorkFlow1 in Figure 4 is executed to extract important parameters from a single procedure, named barrier-rib (BR). 30 selected parameters are reported and verified by domain experts. Within these 30 parame-ters, 15 of them have already been carefully monitored by the analysts, which is consistent with domain knowledge. Another 9 parameters, which are not monitored in the pre-vious production, are confirmed to have great impact on the product quality. After applying WorkFlow1 to the entire production data, 197 important parameters are reported by our system, among which 133 parameters are consistent with production experience, and 50 parameters are verified by do-main experts to have direct impact on the product quality. The details are shown in Figure 11 (blue portion  X  consis-tent with domain expertise; red portion  X  confirmed to be important which was previously ignored; white portion  X  excluded after verification).
 To discover meaningful parameter values, WorkFlow2 in Figure 4 is used. We separate the production data to two sets by the product qualities (GOOD, i.e., qualified prod-ucts, and SCRAP, i.e., defective products) and execute Work-Flow2 on these two sets, respectively. The analysis generates hundreds of frequent parameter value combinations for each given dataset (the number of outputs can be restricted by empirically setting a threshold of confidence). By extracting the frequent combinations in SCRAP that are not frequent in GOOD, we can obtain the value combinations that may result in defective products. Figure 12 shows a verification of a sample combination &lt; para-xxxx-014=0, para-xxxx-015=0 or 24, para-xxxx-043=44 or 48 &gt; (big red crosses indicate that the values present densely on SCRAP products). Such a parameter value combination should be avoided in the pro-duction practice.

By applying regression analysis in WorkFlow1 of Figure 4, we discovered that environmental parameters, such as tem-perature and humidity, have significant correlations with the product quality. Further analysis confirmed that when the surrounding temperature of BR Furnace is under 27  X  C, the
Figure 12: A Sample Parameter Combination. number of defective products with BR Open or BR Short increases dramatically. Figure 10 depicts such findings.
The aforementioned findings are some typical examples obtained from the practical usage of our proposed system. Most of our findings have been validated by PDP technicians and are incorporated into their operational manual. PDP-Miner has been successfully applied in ChangHong COC X  X  PDP production line of the 3rd and 4th generations of products for manufacturing optimization. Every time the product line is upgraded, the yield rate drops significantly since previous parameter settings could not match new prod-ucts requirements. The earlier parameters are tuned prop-erly, the greater the cost will be reduced. PDP-Miner has been intensively used in such situations for problem diag-nosis, including quickly identifying problematic parameter settings, detecting abnormal parameter values, and moni-toring sensitive parameters.

In summary, our system brings several great benefits in optimizing the production process:
By taking advantage of our system, the overall PDP yield rate increases from 91% to 94%. Monthly production capac-ity is boosted by 10,000 panels, which brings more than 117 million RMB of revenue improvement per year 5 . Our system plays an revolutionary role and can be naturally transferred to other flat panel industries, such as Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) panels and Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) panels, to generate great social and economic benefits.
PDP-Miner has been deployed as an important supplemen-tary component since the year 2013. It enables prompt data analysis and efficient knowledge discovering in advanced man-ufacturing processes. The improved production efficacy shows that a practical data-driven solution that considers both sys-tem flexibility and algorithm customization is expected to fill the application gap between the manufacturer and data analysts. We firmly believe that, if properly being applied, the use of data analytics will become a dominating factor to underpin new waves of productivity growth and innovation, and to transform the way of manufacturings across indus-tries in a fundamental manner.
