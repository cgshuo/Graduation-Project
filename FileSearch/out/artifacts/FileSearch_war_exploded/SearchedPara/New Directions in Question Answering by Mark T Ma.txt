 New Directions in Question Answering is a collection of papers from the AAAI Spring Symposium of the same title held in March 2003. The book is intended to:  X   X  X otivate and define the field of question answering X   X  be  X  X  standard reference for new developments in the field X , and  X  encourage  X  X ontinued research into remaining problems and catalyse new applications X . It addresses all its goals well and in general is very much forward-looking. Apart from an interesting paper on the commercial deployment of question answering applications, there is little historical review of the development of the field, and the extent to which it has been driven by the TREC-QA track evaluations, which have played a significant role in defining the field to date.

The editor X  X  introduction and several of the papers make clear the extent to which question answering (QA) is a proper subset of artificial intelligence (AI). The editor summarises the results of a panel session at the symposium to establish a roadmap for QA research, which raises several significant issues as requirements, including entire AI research areas such as user modelling and inferencing. The discussion of the roadmap is very brief and would perhaps have deserved its own chapter in the book, to better situate the symposium papers. The introduction also contains a useful table of the areas addressed by each paper in the collection. However the table does act to highlight the fact that none of the papers address multilingual issues, which are a significant area for future research.

The editor X  X  introductions to each section are extremely thorough and well written, pro-viding very useful abstracts of all the papers X  main results and contributions. Several of the papers have rather tangential relations to QA, but their relevance and contribution are made clear by the editor X  X  abstracts.

Section 1: Foundation and History situates the book well, giving a broad view of the long term goals for QA as an AI research area, together with a review of practical progress so far and the current status. The first chapter by Nyberg, Burger, Mardis and Ferrucci follows on from the discussion of the roadmap to give a high-level view of the criteria required for QA in general. It makes clear that fully general QA is a very ambitious goal, requiring solutions to various significant AI problems, but it does highlight real systems which are addressing some of the criteria. The next chapter by Ulicny gives a thorough overview of the commercial deployment of QA systems, primarily on the web, including details of systems rarely mentioned in academic literature. The chapter identifies trends in the commercial systems and gives a snapshot of the state of practical QA at the current time.
 Section 2: Definitional, Biographical and Terminology QA introduces one of the main directions of the book: dealing with non-factoid questions. The approaches proposed for both definitional and biographical questions are interesting because they are not domain specific.
Also, the techniques used for answer extraction can be applied to results presentation in general, e.g. for search engine results, and in fact the paper by Blair-Goldensohn, McKeown and Schlaikjer treats answer presentation as a summarization task. The last paper in this section, by Rinaldi, Hess, Dowdall, Molla and Dowdall, addresses questions about closed-domain technical manuals. A method for terminology extraction and thesaurus building is presented as an essential component, which addresses the scalability issue by providing tools to automatically tune to a particular domain.
 Section 3: Multipersective, Temporal and Multimedia QA describes efforts to create re-sources (annotation schemes and annotated corpora) which could potentially be used to drive the development of certain QA system components. The proposed annotation schemes are not specific to QA, also having application in, for example, summarisation, information ex-traction, and natural language generation. The schemes address opinions, time expressions, and visual events, and are generally new proposals, not yet well established. The chapters contain some limited suggestions for the application to QA, but are mainly presentations of potential resources. The chapter by Katz, Lin, Stauffer and Grimson uses the START QA system to query against automatically annotated video surveillance results, demonstrating an interesting example of a very small domain, practically a  X  X locks world X , which has a useful real-world application, although the range of query types available is limited to fairly standard database queries.
 Section 4: Interactive and Scenario-Based QA addresses the utility of interactive dialog to clarify the context of complex questions. Engaging the user in an interaction with a QA system is clearly a new research direction and a necessary step for QA, to deal with ambiguity. The work presented in the paper by Small, Strzalkowski, Liu, Shimizu and Yamrom is particularly interesting in the way it is reusing information extraction (IE) work for a template filling task and to initiate dialog. It uses domain specific templates to analyze the question and the answer candidate paragraph, and if there are mismatches between the question features and the candidate answer features it prompts the user to resolve them. The use of IE templates and techniques is present throughout this section, underlining the impact of IE on closed-domain QA, but also raising the issue of scalability to open-domain QA.
 Section 5: Reuse presents the potential benefits of resource reuse for QA, and a specific example of a system successfully reusing internet frequently asked questions (FAQ) data. The chapter by Light, Ittycheriah, Latto and McCracken is very high-level, stating the require-ments for the ideal reuse of components and resources. It clearly motivates reuse, and gives detailed descriptions of its benefits, but with only fairly simplistic suggestions to practically implement the reuse. The chapter by Tomuro and Lytinen describes the reuse of FAQ files as a resource, mapping user questions either to questions in FAQ data, or directly to answer texts, using linguistic cues to classify question types, including procedural questions. The
FAQ data is relatively small, but it is multi-domain, and this interesting system is very well described.
 Section 6: Advanced Methods for Question Processing and Answering addresses a range of issues. Two of the chapters in this section are interesting future directions for QA. The first one by Mahler makes use of graphical models to perform query expansion and to address complex questions such as those that require finding additional connecting terms needed for the answer. The approach is appealing because of its lack of intensive linguistic processing, to answer an interesting class of questions and to scale to various domains. The chapter by Prager, Chu-Caroll and Czuba proposes a multiple agent answer system which applies multiple strategies to answer a single question based on its type. Their  X  X ossier X  and  X  X onstraint X  strategies are of particular interest, generating additional questions to constrain the answer to the original question. Their evaluation also shows that combining multiple agents to process a given question gives better results than attempting to select a single appropriate agent. The two other chapters in this section represent better known directions. Katz, Felshin, Lin and Marton present the START system which successfully uses a uniform interface to various web sources. This solves a practical problem of integrating new resources in a QA system while abstracting from the internal details of the source. The chapter by Wu, Radev and Fan relates QA to search result presentation, tuning snippets for different question types. While useful for search engines attempting to improve their snippets, it is only relevant to QA systems which produce query-based passages as answers.

Section 7: Knowledge and Inference-Enabled Question Answering emphasises the point from the introduction that full QA is a significant AI problem. The main theme from the section is the importance of answer explanation to QA system users. A user must be able to verify system results in order to trust and use an answer from a system, and generat-ing an explanation requires the presentation of the system X  X  inferencing in human terms. The chapters here present alternative inference systems with mappings to natural language descriptions requiring different levels of natural language technologies. The systems de-scribed are effective, but it is not clear how scalable their manually constructed ontologies are, especially for inferencing systems needing to combine some level of general world knowledge.
 Conclusion The collection suggests that factoid question answering is basically a solved problem, and that new work should address a wide range of complex question types. Several overall themes emerge as significant directions for future research: interactive systems, including dialog with the user; the integration of diverse processing methods and knowledge sources; and answer explanation, including inferencing and summarisation for results presentation. The collection also highlights the overlap with other research areas, such as information extraction, natural language generation and dialog, calling out the dependencies on AI methods. The collection clearly points out new research directions for QA, even if many of the directions are not new for AI.

Scalability is a major concern for many of the proposed approaches, which mostly address very small domains. Few of the papers describe data-driven, learning-based approaches, perhaps mainly because of the lack of suitably annotated corpora of question types other than factoid questions. The TREC-QA track evaluations have focussed on factoid questions until recently, and the resources they produced have driven progress on those question types. The provision of corpora annotated for a wider range of question types may act to drive research in new directions, and the annotation schemes proposed in this collection, motivated by QA, are a step towards the provision of such corpora.
 Overall, this collection gives a useful view of the breadth and diversity of issues facing QA, in the short and long terms. It should certainly meets its goal of encouraging contin-ued research, but whether it will define the field and become a standard reference for new development will depend on how the field develops and which new directions prove fruitful.
