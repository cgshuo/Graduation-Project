 Two of the fundamental components of a natu-ral language communication are word sense dis-covery (Jones, 1986) and word sense disambigua-tion (Ide and Veronis, 1998). While discovery corresponds to acquisition of vocabulary, disam-biguation forms the basis of understanding. These two aspects are not only important from the per-spective of developing computer applications for natural languages but also form the key compo-nents of language evolution and change.

Words take different senses in different contexts while appearing with other words. Context plays a vital role in disambiguation of word senses as well as in the interpretation of the actual mean-ing of words. For instance, the word  X  X ank X  has several distinct interpretations, including that of a  X  X inancial institution X  and the  X  X hore of a river. X  Automatic discovery and disambiguation of word senses from a given text is an important and chal-lenging problem which has been extensively stud-ied in the literature (Jones, 1986; Ide and Vero-nis, 1998; Sch  X  utze, 1998; Navigli, 2009). How-ever, another equally important aspect that has not been so far well investigated corresponds to one or more changes that a word might undergo in its sense. This particular aspect is getting increas-ingly attainable as more and more time-varying text data become available in the form of millions of digitized books (Goldberg and Orwant, 2013) gathered over the last centuries. As a motivat-ing example one could consider the word  X  X ick X   X  while according to the standard English dictio-naries the word is normally used to refer to some sort of illness, a new meaning of  X  X ick X  refer-ring to something that is  X  X razy X  or  X  X ool X  is cur-rently getting popular in the English vernacular. This change is further interesting because while traditionally  X  X ick X  has been associated to some-thing negative in general, the current meaning as-sociates positivity with it. In fact, a rock band by the name of  X  X ick Puppies X  has been founded which probably is inspired by the newer sense of the word sick. The title of this paper has been motivated by the above observation. Note that this phenomena of change in word senses has ex-isted ever since the beginning of human commu-nication (Bamman and Crane, 2011; Michel et al., 2011; Wijaya and Yeniterzi, 2011; Mihalcea and Nastase, 2012); however, with the advent of modern technology and the availability of huge volumes of time-varying data it now has become possible to automatically track such changes and, thereby, help the lexicographers in word sense dis-covery, and design engineers in enhancing vari-ous NLP/IR applications (e.g., disambiguation, se-mantic search etc.) that are naturally sensitive to change in word senses.

The above motivation forms the basis of the central objective set in this paper, which is to de-vise a completely unsupervised approach to track noun sense changes in large texts available over multiple timescales. Toward this objective we make the following contributions: (a) devise a time-varying graph clustering based sense induc-tion algorithm, (b) use the time-varying sense clusters to develop a split-join based approach for identifying new senses of a word, and (c) evalu-ate the performance of the algorithms on various datasets using different suitable approaches along with a detailed error analysis. Remarkably, com-parison with the English WordNet indicates that in 44% cases, as identified by our algorithm, there has been a birth of a completely novel sense, in 46% cases a new sense has split off from an older sense and in 43% cases two or more older senses have merged in to form a new sense.

The remainder of the paper is organized as fol-lows. In the next section we present a short re-view of the literature. In Section 3 we briefly describe the datasets and outline the process of co-occurrence graph construction. In Section 4 we present an approach based on graph cluster-ing to identify the time-varying sense clusters and in Section 5 we present the split-merge based ap-proach for tracking word sense changes. Evalu-ation methods are summarized in Section 6. Fi-nally, conclusions and further research directions are outlined in Section 7. Word sense disambiguation as well as word sense discovery have both remained key areas of re-search right from the very early initiatives in nat-ural language processing research. Ide and Vero-nis (1998) present a very concise survey of the his-tory of ideas used in word sense disambiguation; for a recent survey of the state-of-the-art one can refer to (Navigli, 2009). Some of the first attempts to automatic word sense discovery were made by Karen Sp  X  arck Jones (1986); later in lexicography, it has been extensively used as a pre-processing step for preparing mono-and multi-lingual dictio-naries (Kilgarriff and Tugwell, 2001; Kilgarriff, 2004). However, as we have already pointed out that none of these works consider the temporal as-pect of the problem.

In contrast, the current study, is inspired by works on language dynamics and opinion spread-ing (Mukherjee et al., 2011; Maity et al., 2012; Loreto et al., 2012) and automatic topic detection and tracking (Allan et al., 1998). However, our work differs significantly from those proposed in the above studies. Opinion formation deals with the self-organisation and emergence of shared vo-cabularies whereas our work focuses on how the different senses of these vocabulary words change over time and thus become  X  X ut-of-vocabulary X . Topic detection involves detecting the occurrence of a new event such as a plane crash, a murder, a jury trial result, or a political scandal in a stream of news stories from multiple sources and track-ing is the process of monitoring a stream of news stories to find those that track (or discuss) the same event. This is done on shorter timescales (hours, days), whereas our study focuses on larger timescales (decades, centuries) and we are inter-ested in common nouns, verbs and adjectives as opposed to events that are characterized mostly by named entities. Other similar works on dynamic topic modelling can be found in (Blei and Laf-ferty, 2006; Wang and McCallum, 2006). Google tool which charts the yearly count of selected letter combinations, words, or phrases as found in over 5.2 million digitized books. It only reports fre-quency of word usage over the years, but does not give any correlation among them as e.g., in (Heyer et al., 2009), and does not analyze their senses.
A few approaches suggested by (Bond et al., 2009; P  X  a  X  akk  X  o and Lind  X  en, 2012) attempt to aug-ment WordNet synsets primarily using methods of annotation. Another recent work by Cook et al. (2013) attempts to induce word senses and then identify novel senses by comparing two different corpora: the  X  X ocus corpora X  (i.e., a recent version of the corpora) and the  X  X eference corpora X  (older version of the corpora). However, this method is limited as it only considers two time points to identify sense changes as opposed to our approach which is over a much larger timescale, thereby, ef-fectively allowing us to track the points of change and the underlying causes. One of the closest work to what we present here has been put forward by (Tahmasebi et al., 2011), where the authors an-alyze a newspaper corpus containing articles be-tween 1785 and 1985. The authors mainly report the frequency patterns of certain words that they found to be candidates for change; however a de-tailed cause analysis as to why and how a particu-lar word underwent a sense change has not been demonstrated. Further, systematic evaluation of the results obtained by the authors has not been provided.

All the above points together motivated us to undertake the current work where we introduce, for the first time, a completely unsupervised and automatic method to identify the change of a word sense and the cause for the same. Further, we also present an extensive evaluation of the proposed al-gorithm in order to test its overall accuracy and performance. In this section, we outline a brief description of the dataset used for our experiments and the graph construction procedure. The primary source of data have been the millions of digitized books made available through the Google Book project (Goldberg and Orwant, 2013). The Google Book syntactic n-grams dataset provides depen-dency fragment counts by the years. However, in-stead of using the plain syntactic n-grams, we use a far richer representation of the data in the form of a distributional thesaurus (Lin, 1997; Rychl  X  y and Kilgarriff, 2007). In specific, we prepare a distri-butional thesaurus (DT) for each of the time peri-ods separately and subsequently construct the re-quired networks. We briefly outline the procedure of thesauri construction here referring the reader to (Riedl and Biemann, 2013) for further details. In this approach, we first extract each word and a set of its context features, which are formed by la-beled and directed dependency parse edges as pro-vided in the dataset. Following this, we compute the frequencies of the word, the context and the words along with their context. Next we calculate the lexicographer X  X  mutual information LMI (Kil-garriff, 2004) between a word and its features and retain only the top 1000 ranked features for ev-ery word. Finally, we construct the DT network as follows: each word is a node in the network and the edge weight between two nodes is defined as the number of features that the two corresponding words share in common. The basic idea of our algorithm for tracking sense changes is as follows. If a word undergoes a sense change, this can be detected by comparing its senses obtained from two different time pe-riods. Since we aim to detect this change au-tomatically, we require distributional representa-tions corresponding to word senses for different time periods. We, therefore, utilize the basic hy-pothesis of unsupervised sense induction to in-duce the sense clusters over various time periods and then compare these clusters to detect sense change. The basic premises of the  X  X nsupervised sense induction X  are briefly described below. 4.1 Unsupervised sense induction We use the co-occurrence based graph clustering framework introduced in (Biemann, 2006). The algorithm proceeds in three basic steps. Firstly, a co-occurrence graph is created for every target word found in DT. Next, the neighbourhood/ego graph is clustered using the Chinese Whispers (CW) algorithm (see (McAuley and Leskovec, 2012) for similar approaches). The algorithm, in particular, produces a set of clusters for each target word by decomposing its open neighborhood. We hypothesize that each different cluster corresponds to a particular sense of the target word. For a de-tailed description, the reader is referred to (Bie-mann, 2011).

If a word undergoes sense change, this can be detected by comparing the sense clusters obtained from two different time periods by the algorithm outlined above. For this purpose, we use statis-tics from the DT corresponding to two different time intervals, say tv i and tv j . We then run the sense induction algorithm over these two different datasets. Now, for a given word w that appears in both the datasets, we get two different set of clusters, say C i and C j . Without loss of gener-ality, let us assume that our algorithm detects m sense clusters for the word w in tv i and n sense clusters in tv j . Let C i = { s i 1 , s i 2 , . . . , s C j = { s j 1 , s j 2 , . . . , s jn } , where s kz denotes z th sense cluster for word w during time interval tv k . We next describe our algorithm for detecting sense change from these sets of sense clusters. 4.2 Split, join, birth and death We hypothesize that word w can undergo sense change from one time interval ( tv i ) to another ( tv j ) as per one of the following scenarios: Split A sense cluster s iz in tv i splits into two (or more) sense clusters, s jp Join Two sense clusters s iz make a single cluster s jp in tv j Birth A new sense cluster s jp appears in tv j , which was absent in tv i Death A sense cluster s iz in tv i dies out and does not appear in tv j To detect split, join, birth or death, we build an ( m +1)  X  ( n +1) matrix I to capture the intersec-tion between sense clusters of two different time periods. The first m rows and n columns corre-spond to the sense clusters in tv i and tv j espec-tively. We append an additional row and column to capture the fraction of words, which did not show up in any of the sense clusters in another time in-terval. So, an element I kl of the matrix  X  1  X  k  X  m, 1  X  l  X  n : denotes the frac- X  k = m + 1 , 1  X  l  X  n : denotes the fraction  X  1  X  k  X  m, l = n + 1 : denotes the fraction Thus, the matrix I captures all the four possible scenarios for sense change. Since we can not expect a perfect split, birth etc., we used certain threshold values to detect if a candidate word is undergoing sense change via one of these four cases. In Figure 1, as an example, we illustrate the birth of a new sense for the word  X  X ompiler X . 4.3 Multi-stage filtering To make sure that the candidate words obtained via our algorithm are meaningful, we applied multi-stage filtering to prune the candidate word list. The following criterion were used for the fil-tering: Stage 1 We utilize the fact that the CW algorithm is non-deterministic in nature. We apply CW three times over the source and target time inter-vals. We obtain the candidate word lists using our algorithm for the three runs, then take the inter-section to output those words, which came up in all the three runs.
 Stage 2 From the above list, we retain only those candidate words, which have a part-of-speech tag  X  X N X  or  X  X NS X , as we focus on nouns for this work.
 Stage 3 We sort the candidate list obtained in
Stage 2 as per their occurrence in the first time period. Then, we remove the top 20% and the bottom 20% words from this list. Therefore, we consider the torso of the frequency distribution which is the most informative part for this type of an analysis. For our experiments, we utilized DTs created for 8 different time periods: 1520-1908, 1909-1953, 1954-1972, 1973-1986, 1987-1995, 1996-2001, 2002-2005 and 2006-2008 (Riedl et al., 2014). The time periods were set such that the amount of data in each time period is roughly the same. We will also use T 1 to T 8 to denote these time pe-riods. The parameters for CW clustering were set as follows. The size of the neighbourhood ( N ) to be clustered was set to 200 . The parameter n regulating the edge density in this neighbourhood was set to 200 as well. The parameter a was set to lin , which corresponds to favouring smaller clus-used to detect the sense changes were as follows. For birth, at least 80% words of the target cluster should be novel. For split, each split cluster should have at least 30% words of the source cluster and the total intersection of all the split clusters should be &gt; 80% . The same parameters were used for the join and death case with the interchange of source and target clusters. 5.1 Signals of sense change Making comparisons between all the pairs of time periods gave us 28 candidate words lists. For each of these comparison, we applied the multi-stage filtering to obtain the pruned list of candidate words. Table 1 provides some statistics about the number of candidate words obtained correspond-ing to the birth case. The rows correspond to the source time-period and the columns correspond to the target time periods. An element of the table shows the number of candidate words obtained by comparing the corresponding source and target time periods.
 Table 1: Number of candidate birth senses be-tween all time periods
The table clearly shows a trend. For most of the cases, the number of candidate birth senses tends to increase as we go from left to right. Sim-ilarly, this number decreases as we go down in the table. This is quite intuitive since going from left to right corresponds to increasing the gap be-tween two time periods while going down cor-responds to decreasing this gap. As the gap in-creases (decreases), one would expect more (less) new senses coming in. Even while moving diago-nally, the candidate words tend to decrease as we move downwards. This corresponds to the fact that the number of years in the time periods de-creases as we move downwards, and therefore, the gap also decreases. 5.2 Stability analysis &amp; sense change location Formally, we consider a sense change from tv i to tv j stable if it was also detected while com-paring tv i with the following time periods tv k s. This number of subsequent time periods, where the same sense change is detected, helps us to de-termine the age of a new sense. Similarly, for a candidate sense change from tv i to tv j , we say that the location of the sense change is tv j if and only if that sense change does not get detected by com-paring tv i with any time interval tv k , intermediate between tv i and tv j .

Table 1 gives a lot of candidate words for sense change. However, not all the candidate words were stable. Thus, it was important to prune these results using stability analysis. Also, it is to be noted that these results do not pin-point to the ex-act time-period, when the sense change might have taken place. For instance, among the 4238 candi-date birth sense detected by comparing T 1 and T 6 , many of these new senses might have come up in between T 2 to T 5 as well. We prune these lists fur-ther based on the stability of the sense, as well as to locate the approximate time interval, in which the sense change might have occurred.

Table 2 shows the number of stable (at least twice) senses as well as the number of stable sense changes located in that particular time pe-riod. While this decreases recall, we found this to be beneficial for the accuracy of the method.
Once we were able to locate the senses as well as to find the age of the senses, we attempted to Table 2: Number of candidate birth senses ob-tained for different time periods select some representative words and plotted them on a timeline as per the birth period and their age in Figure 2. The source time period here is 1909-1953. During evaluation, we considered the clusters ob-tained using the 1909-1953 time-slice as our refer-ence and attempted to track sense change by com-paring these with the clusters obtained for 2002-2005. The sense change detected was categorized as to whether it was a new sense (birth), a single sense got split into two or more senses (split) or two or more senses got merged (join) or a particu-lar sense died (death). We present a few instances of the resulting clusters in the paper and refer the of the results. 6.1 Manual evaluation The algorithm detected a lot of candidate words for the cases of birth, split/join as well as death. Since it was difficult to go through all the candi-date sense changes for all the comparisons man-ually, we decided to randomly select some can-didate words, which were flagged by our algo-rithm as undergoing sense change, while compar-ing 1909-1953 and 2002-2005 DT. We selected 48 random samples of candidate words for birth cases and 21 random samples for split/join cases. One of the authors annotated each of the birth cases identifying whether or not the algorithm signalled a true sense change while another author did the same task for the split/join cases. The accuracy as per manual evaluation was found to be 60.4% for the birth cases and 57% for the split/join cases.
Table 3 shows the evaluation results for a few candidate words, flagged due to birth. Columns correspond to the candidate words, words obtained in the cluster of each candidate word (we will use the term  X  X irth cluster X  for these words, hence-forth), which indicated a new sense, the results of manual evaluation as well as the possible sense this birth cluster denotes.

Table 4 shows the corresponding evaluation re-sults for a few candidate words, flagged due to split or join.

A further analysis of the words marked due to birth in the random samples indicates that there are 22 technology-related words, 2 slangs, 3 economics related words and 2 general words. For the split-join case we found that there are 3 technology-related words while the rest of the words are general. Therefore one of the key ob-servations is that most of the technology related words (where the neighborhood is completely new) could be extracted from our birth results. In contrast, for the split-join instances most of the re-sults are from the general category since the neigh-borhood did not change much here; it either got split or merged from what it was earlier. 6.2 Automated evaluation with WordNet In addition to manual evaluation, we also per-formed automated evaluation for the candidate words. We chose WordNet for automated evalua-tion because not only does it have a wide coverage of word senses but also it is being maintained and updated regularly to incorporate new senses. We did this evaluation for the candidate birth, join and split sense clusters obtained by comparing 1909-1953 time period with respect to 2002-2005. For our evaluation, we developed an aligner to align the word clusters obtained with WordNet senses. The aligner constructs a WordNet dictionary for the purpose of synset alignment. The CW clus-ter is then aligned to WordNet synsets by compar-ing the clusters with WordNet graph and the synset with the maximum alignment score is returned as the output. In summary, the aligner tool takes as input the CW cluster and returns a WordNet synset id that corresponds to the cluster words. The eval-uation settings were as follows: Birth: For a candidate word flagged as birth, we first find out the set of all WordNet synset ids for its CW clusters in the source time period (1909-1953 in this case). Let S init denote the union of these synset ids. We then find WordNet synset id for its birth-cluster, say s new . Then, if s new /  X  1909-1953 and 2002-2005
S init , it implies that this is a new sense that was not present in the source clusters and we call it a  X  X uccess X  as per WordNet.
 Join: For the join case, we find WordNet synset ids s 1 and s 2 for the clusters obtained in the source time period and s new for the join cluster in the target time period. If s 1 6 = s 2 and s new is either s 1 or s 2 , we call it a  X  X uccess X .
 Split: For the split case, we find WordNet synset id s old for the source cluster and synset ids s 1 and s 2 for the target split clusters. If s 1 6 = s 2 and either s 1 , or s 2 retains the id s old , we call it a  X  X uccess X .

Table 5 show the results of WordNet based eval-uation. In case of birth we observe a success of Table 5: Results of the automatic evaluation using WordNet 44% while for split and join we observe a success of 46% and 43% respectively. We then manually verified some of the words that were deemed as successes, as well as investigated WordNet sense they were mapped to. Table 6 shows some of the words for which the evaluation detected success along with WordNet senses. Clearly, the cluster words correspond to a newer sense for these words 1909-1953 and 2002-2005 and the mapped WordNet synset matches the birth cluster to a very high degree. 6.3 Evaluation with a slang list Slangs are words and phrases that are regarded as very informal, and are typically restricted to a par-ticular context. New slang words come up every now and then, and this plays an integral part in the phenomena of sense change. We therefore decided to perform an evaluation as to how many slang words were being detected by our candidate birth clusters. We used a list of slangs available from years 2002-2005 and found the intersection with our candidate birth words. Note that the website had a large number of multi-word expressions that we did not consider in our study. Further, some of the words appeared as either erroneous or very transient (not existing more than a few months) en-tires, which had to be removed from the list. All these removal left us with a very little space for comparison; however, despite this we found 25 slangs from the website that were present in our birth results, e.g.  X  X um X ,  X  X issy X ,  X  X hug X ,  X  X ude X  etc. 6.4 Evaluation of candidate death clusters Much of our evaluation was focussed on the birth sense clusters, mainly because these are more in-teresting from a lexicographic perspective. Addi-tionally, the main theme of this work was to de-tect new senses for a given word. To detect a true death of a sense, persistence analysis was re-quired, that is, to verify if the sense was persist-ing earlier and vanished after a certain time period. While such an analysis goes beyond the scope of this paper, we selected some interesting candidate  X  X eath X  senses. Table 7 shows some of these inter-esting candidate words, their death cluster along with the possible vanished meaning, identified by the authors. While these words are still used in a related sense, the original meaning does not exist in the modern usage. In this paper, we presented a completely unsu-pervised method to detect word sense changes by analyzing millions of digitized books archived spanning several centuries. In particular, we con-structed DT networks over eight different time windows, clustered these networks and compared these clusters to identify the emergence of novel senses. The performance of our method has been evaluated manually as well as by comparison with WordNet and a list of slang words. Through man-ual evaluation we found that the algorithm could correctly identify 60.4% birth cases from a set of 48 random samples and 57% split/join cases from a set of 21 randomly picked samples. Quite strik-ingly, we observe that (i) in 44% cases the birth of a novel sense is attested by WordNet, (ii) in 46% cases the split of an older sense is signalled on comparison with WordNet and (iii) in 43% cases the join of two senses is attested by WordNet. These results might have strong lexicographic im-plications  X  even if one goes by very moderate es-timates almost half of the words would be candi-date entries in WordNet if they were not already part of it. This method can be extremely useful in the construction of lexico-semantic networks for low-resource languages, as well as for keeping lexico-semantic resources up to date in general.
Future research directions based on this work are manifold. On one hand, our method can be used by lexicographers in designing new dictio-naries where candidate new senses can be semi-automatically detected and included, thus greatly reducing the otherwise required manual effort. On the other hand, this method can be directly used for various NLP/IR applications like seman-tic search, automatic word sense discovery as well as disambiguation. For semantic search, taking into account the newer senses of the word can in-crease the relevance of the query result. Similarly, a disambiguation engine informed with the newer senses of a word can increase the efficiency of disambiguation, and recognize senses uncovered by the inventory that would otherwise have to be wrongly assigned to covered senses. In addition, this method can be also extended to the  X  X NP X  part-of-speech (i.e., named entities) to identify changes in role of a person/place. Furthermore, it would be interesting to apply this method to lan-guages other than English and to try to align new senses of cognates across languages.
