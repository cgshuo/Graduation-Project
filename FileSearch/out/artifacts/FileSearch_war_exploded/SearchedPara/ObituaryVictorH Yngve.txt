Victor Yngve (5 July 1920 to 15 January 2012) was a major contributor in a number of fields within computational linguistics: as the leading researcher in machine translation (MT) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), as editor of its first journal, as designer and developer of the first non-numerical programming language (COMIT), and as an influential contributor to linguistic theory.
 during 1950 X 1953, Yngve had an idea for using the newly invented computers to translate languages. He contemplated building a translation machine based on simple dictionary lookup. At this time he knew nothing of the earlier speculations of Warren Weaver and others (Hutchins 1997). Then during a visit to Claude Shannon at Bell
Telephone Laboratories in early 1952 he heard about a conference on machine trans-lation to be held at MIT in June of that year. He attended the opening public meeting and participated in conference discussions, and then, after Bar-Hillel X  X  departure from MIT, he was appointed in July 1953 by Jerome Wiesner at the Research Laboratory for Electronics (RLE) to lead the MT research effort there. (For a retrospective survey of his MT research activities see Yngve [2000].) around the Georgetown X  X BM system demonstrated in January 1954. Yngve was ap-palled to see research of such a limited nature reported in newspapers; his background in physics required experiments to be carefully planned, with their assumptions made plain, and properly tested and reviewed by other researchers. He was determined to set the new field of MT on a proper scientific course. The first step was a journal for the field, to be named Mechanical Translation  X  X he field became  X  X achine translation X  in later years. He found a collaborator for the journal in William N. Locke of the MIT
Modern Languages department. The aim was to provide a forum for information about what research was going on in the form of abstracts, and then for peer-reviewed articles. The first issue appeared in March 1954.
 earlier ideas on word-for-word translation. The results of translating from German were published in the collection edited by Locke and Booth (Yngve 1955b). One example of output began:
It was obvious that the output was poor, but nevertheless it appeared to be good enough for scientists with some knowledge of German grammar to read and extract relevant information. Yngve concluded that word-for-word translation could be taken as a first approximation. But a major problem was that many words have more than one meaning out of context.
 fore translation; and Victor Oswald proposed the use of microglossaries (dictionaries limited to one specific narrow field) in order to reduce the number of homographs.
But Yngve believed that the problem of multiple meanings could be resolved with syntactic analysis. Nonetheless, he rejected Bar-Hillel X  X   X  X perational syntax X  put for-ward at the 1952 conference (and later known as categorical syntax) as too complex for long sentences and too remote from traditional grammatical distinctions. He had been impressed by the work of Bloomfield and Fries, and had become convinced that lin-guistics could provide stable and repeatable methods akin to the procedures of cosmic ray physics. Therefore, over the following years, he appointed a number of linguists to the RLE staff, starting with Noam Chomsky in 1955, in order to undertake basic research. He was disappointed, however, that most of the linguists he hired were more interested in pursuing their theoretical studies than in tackling the practical problems of MT.
 isolation of the different possible grammatical functions of words. The aim was to set up mutually exclusive word-classes (i.e., one class for the noun function, another for the ver bfunction, and so on) The approach was to set up su bstitution frames to isolate contexts. Thus walk may occur in the frame (1) The was enjoyable or in the frame (2) They home every day.

Taking words from a corpus and testing in each frame produces a matrix of different contexts (substitution frames) and the words occurring in those contexts. These words form a word-class and their frames form context classes. As a result, each sentence sequence of word-classes would determine a unique sequence of context classes. An algorithm was proposed which searched left-to-right for the longest match for a se-quence of word-classes. Sequences of word-classes formed phrases and clauses, so the algorithm was capable of looking also for phrase sequences. On this basis, a table-driven algorithm for syntactic analysis was designed and implemented (Yngve 1955b). This demonstrated for the first time in MT the importance and practical value of separating descriptive linguistic information (in this case, words and contexts) and language-independent algorithmic procedures (searching and matching). The practice was widely adopted by other groups in MT and in computational linguistics.
 switching theory and on Shannon X  X  information theory. Yngve decided to investigate error correcting properties of language (Yngve 1954). Sequences of letters and words are not random but constrained by codes specifying which sequences are legitimate.
Testing a text for deviations from randomness would help to reveal its structure. A first step would be the location of all occurrences of a given frequent word and the deter-mination of its effect on the occurrence of other frequent words in the neighborhood by comparing their frequency of occurrence with what would be expected if they occurred at random. For this investigation of what was to be called  X  X ap analysis X  (Yngve 1956) 462 a computational experiment was conducted on a corpus of just 9,490 words. First, the most frequent words were identified: the (599 instances), to (252), of (241), a (221), and (207), and in (162). Then, the gaps between these words were determined (in numbers of intervening words). In the case of of and the the gaps were one ( the of ), two ( the of ), three ( the of ), and so on, with frequencies of 72, 31, and 6, respectively. These results pointed to syntactic constraints on constructions with of and the . Further results indicated that  X  X tructures with the can be expected to have two or three words, and constructions with and frequently involve at least fifteen words. X 
Similar observations were that  X  of is different from to in that it frequently follows a or the with a gap of one or two.

Unfortunately, at the time, these encouraging results could not be pursued because of the lack of large enough corpora in machine-readable form.
 for machine translation, where speakers encode a message that is decoded by a recipient (Yngve 1955a). Between encoding and decoding there would be some representation of the  X  X essage X  to be preserved in translation. Further consideration recognized that structural representations of input would not be the same as those required for out-put, however. Attention, therefore, focused on the transition stage where the meaning or message of the input language would be expressed and where choices would be made for producing output sentence structure. Thus the MIT group saw the need for a three-stage model: syntactic analysis, structure transfer, and synthesis X  X  model for many transfer-based MT systems in subsequent years. Yngve X  X  model was, however, purely syntactic; no attempt was made at this time to include semantic information (Yngve 1957).
 leagues tackled the problem of how linguists could be productive in MT research. They decided that what was needed was a programming system that accepted notations of a kind familiar to linguists, rather than systems such as FORTRAN and COBOL designed for mathematicians and business applications. Thus, in collaboration with the
MIT Computation Center, they developed the first programming language designed specifically for string-handling and pattern-matching, COMIT (Yngve 1961a, 1967). It was ready for testing in late 1957 X  X hus antedating by two years LISP, another program-ming language devised for linguistics applications. COMIT was later used as a basis for the SNOBOL language.
 three-stage model in the development of an algorithm for sentence production. Initially the generative grammar of Chomsky seemed to be an ideal model. What was required in
MT, however, was not the generation of all grammatical sentences from a given source but particular specifiable sentences in context. The rules of a grammar derived from a simple children X  X  story were written in COMIT in 1959 and tested in a program of random sentence production (Yngve 1961b). Its main objective, in which it succeeded, was to test the validity of the grammar rules, particularly rules for discontinuous constructions and for coordination.
 the  X  X epth hypothesis, X  for which Yngve is probably now best known (Yngve 1960a) both in linguistics and in computational linguistics. The transformational approach had already been rejected because it required too much storage space. The next question was how much storage (push-down store) was needed for discontinuous (left-branching) expansion and for regular (right-branching) expansion. It was clear that right expansion (or  X  X rogressive X  application) was potentially infinite: the dog that worried the cat that killed the rat that ate the malt ... . On the other hand, left expansion (or  X  X egressive X  appli-cation) was limited: the malt that the rat that the cat that the dog worried killed ate . Yngve calculated the maximum amount of extra temporary memory required to produce a sentence (i.e., the number of unexpanded constituents at any one time [its depth]). He found that in practice even very long sentences seldom had a depth of more than two or three. Sentences with depths of more than three, such as the  X  X egressive X  constructions, were often considered ungrammatical and/or unintelligible. Yngve noted the relation-ship of this linguistic feature to the restrictions on immediate memory and processing identified by Miller (1956). Most languages include mechanisms for restricting the depth of regressive constructions, such as agglutination and compounding.
 glish, including its historical changes, and also appeared to account for many features in other languages. Yngve recognized that it arose from MT research and not from linguistic theory, however. It was a hypothesis that needed to be tested against empirical evidence. Its significance for linguistics was widely recognized from the beginning, but it did not conform to the preconceptions of Chomskyan theory. Although Chomsky had championed the rigorous statement of theory and its strict application to linguistic material without ad hoc adjustments (Chomsky 1957, page 5), he regarded the depth hypothesis not as a testable scientific hypothesis but as a rival linguistic theory. For Yngve this attitude was unscientific.

Apart from Yngve X  X  own contributions to many aspects of syntactic analysis (the three-stage transfer model, the depth hypothesis, and not least computer programming), his colleagues also made significant contributions in a variety of areas: grammar theory (Gilbert Harman and Kenneth Knowlton), semantics (Elinor Charney), logic and lan-guage (Jared Darlington), transfer and interlingua (Edward Klima), computer storage (William S. Cooper), Arabic translation (Arnold Satterthwait), and French translation (David Dinneen).

 coming to an end. The aim had been to provide a public record of achievement in MT. His ambitions for the journal could not be fulfilled, however, for various reasons. There were relatively few outstanding contributions submitted for publication; many
MT researchers were funded by government bodies, which required the submission of 464 fairly frequent reports, and these reports were distributed widely to other researchers and public institutions. Researchers believed they had fulfilled their duties to publicize research, and did not see the need to submit shorter articles to a peer-reviewed journal which would probably not appear for several months. In addition the journal could not survive solely on subscription charges, and authors were asked to contribute a page charge towards publication costs, which they were reluctant to do.

The Association took over Yngve X  X  journal with a changed title, Mechanical Translation andComputationalLinguistics , and Yngve remaining as editor. Even with the inclusion of many more articles in computational linguistics and significantly fewer in MT, however, the journal became ever more irregular and it was wound up in 1970.

X  From 1965, Yngve published a series of papers devoted to the founda-tions of linguistic theory, many at the conferences of LACUS (Linguistic Association of
Canada and the United States). Just as when he had founded the Mechanical Translation journal in 1954, he was determined to put studies of language on a sound scientific footing. His recurrent theme was the unscientific nature of current linguistics. In this period, he set forth the framework of what he called  X  X uman linguistics X  (later  X  X ard-science linguistics X ) where the units being analyzed are not the traditional properties of sentences, verbs, noun phrases, gender, tense, phonemes, and so on, which, as he demonstrated, are unfounded assumptions derived often from Greek philosophical speculations. Instead the basic participants are communicating individuals and physical observable  X  X rops X  (abstractions of relevant physical objects, clocks, doors),  X  X hannels X  of communication (sound waves, writing, signs), and  X  X ettings X  (relevant aspects of the physical environment, ticket counters, rooms).

The basic contention is that fundamental concepts of linguistics are intuitions and not based on the observable behavior of people communicating. Yngve describes a detailed comprehensive program for a new foundation of linguistics in which  X  X e abandon the unsupported assumptions of signs, words, meanings, and sentences X  and move completely into  X  X he world of sound waves and the people who speak and understand where we can test our theories and hypotheses against observations of the physical reality all the way down to the basic assumptions of all science X  (Yngve 1996, page 308).
