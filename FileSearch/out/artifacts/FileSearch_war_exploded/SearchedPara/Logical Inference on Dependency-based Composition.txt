 Dependency-based Compositional Semantics (DCS) provides an intuitive way to model seman-tics of questions, by using simple dependency-like trees (Liang et al., 2011). It is expressive enough to represent complex natural language queries on a relational database, yet simple enough to be latently learned from question-answer pairs. In this paper, we equip DCS with logical inference , which, in one point of view, is  X  X he best way of testing an NLP system X  X  semantic capacity X  (Cooper et al., 1996).

It should be noted that, however, a framework primarily designed for question answering is not readily suited for logical inference. Because, an-swers returned by a query depend on the specific database, but implication is independent of any databases. For example, answers to the question  X  What books are read by students?  X , should al-ways be a subset of answers to  X  What books are ever read by anyone?  X , no matter how we store the data of students and how many records of books are there in our database.

Thus, our first step is to fix a notation which ab-stracts the calculation process of DCS trees, so as to clarify its meaning without the aid of any exist-ing database. The idea is to borrow a minimal set of operators from relational algebra (Codd, 1970), which is already able to formulate the calculation in DCS and define abstract denotation , which is an abstraction of the computation of denotations guided by DCS trees. Meanings of sentences then can be represented by primary relations among abstract denotations. This formulation keeps the simpleness and computability of DCS trees mostly unaffected; for example, our semantic calculation for DCS trees is parallel to the denotation compu-tation in original DCS.

An inference engine is built to handle inference on abstract denotations. Moreover, to compensate the lack of background knowledge in practical in-ference, we combine our framework with the idea of tree transformation (Bar-Haim et al., 2007), to propose a way of generating knowledge in logical representation from entailment rules (Szpektor et al., 2007), which are by now typically considered as syntactic rewriting rules.

We test our system on FraCaS (Cooper et al., 1996) and PASCAL RTE datasets (Dagan et al., 2006). The experiments show: (i) a competi-tive performance on FraCaS dataset; (ii) a big impact of our automatically generated on-the-fly knowledge in achieving high recall for a logic-based RTE system; and (iii) a result that outper-forms state-of-the-art RTE system on RTE5 data. Our whole system is publicly released and can be downloaded from http://kmcs.nii.ac. jp/tianran/tifmo/ . In this section we describe the idea of represent-ing natural language semantics by DCS trees, and achieving inference by computing logical relations among the corresponding abstract denotations.
Figure 1: The DCS tree of  X  students read books  X 
Table 1: Databases of student , book , and read 2.1 DCS trees DCS trees has been proposed to represent natu-ral language semantics with a structure similar to dependency trees (Liang et al., 2011) (Figure 1). For the sentence  X  students read books  X , imagine a database consists of three tables, namely, a set of students, a set of books, and a set of  X  X eading X  events (Table 1). The DCS tree in Figure 1 is in-terpreted as a command for querying these tables, obtaining  X  X eading X  entries whose  X  SUBJ  X  field is student and whose  X  OBJ  X  field is book . The result is a set { John reads Ulysses ,... } , which is called a denotation .

DCS trees can be extended to represent linguis-tic phenomena such as quantification and coref-erence, with additional markers introducing addi-tional operations on tables. Figure 2 shows an ex-ample with a quantifier  X  every  X , which is marked as  X   X   X  on the edge ( love ) OBJ-ARG ( dog ) and in-terpreted as a division operator q OBJ  X  (  X  2.2). Op-timistically, we believe DCS can provide a frame-work of semantic representation with sufficiently wide coverage for real-world texts.

The strict semantics of DCS trees brings us the idea of applying DCS to logical inference. This is not trivial, however, because DCS works under the assumption that databases are explicitly available. Obviously this is unrealistic for logical inference on unrestricted texts, because we cannot prepare a database for everything in the world. This fact fairly restricts the applicable tasks of DCS.
Our solution is to redefine DCS trees without the aid of any databases, by considering each node of a DCS tree as a content word in a sentence (but may no longer be a table in a specific database), while each edge represents semantic relations be-tween two words. The labels on both ends of an edge, such as SUBJ (subject) and OBJ (ob-ject), are considered as semantic roles of the cor-Figure 2: DCS trees of  X  Mary loves every dog  X  (Left-Up),  X  Tom has a dog  X  (Left-Down), and  X  Tom has an animal that Mary loves  X  (Right). querying process defined by a DCS tree, we pro-vide formal semantics to DCS trees by employing relational algebra (Codd, 1970) for representing the query. As described below, we represent mean-ings of sentences with abstract denotations , and logical relations among sentences are computed as relations among their abstract denotations. In this way, we can perform inference over formulas of relational algebra, without computing database entries explicitly. 2.2 Abstract denotations Abstract denotations are formulas constructed from a minimal set of relational algebra (Codd, 1970) operators, which is already able to formu-late the database queries defined by DCS trees.
For example, the semantics of  X  students read books  X  is given by the abstract denotation: where read , student and book denote sets repre-sented by these words respectively, and w r repre-sents the set w considered as the domain of the semantic role r (e.g. book OBJ is the set of books considered as objects). The operators  X  and  X  rep-resent intersection and Cartesian product respec-tively, both borrowed from relational algebra. It is not hard to see the abstract denotation denotes the intersection of the  X  reading  X  set (as illustrated by the  X  read  X  table in Table 1) with the product of  X  student  X  set and  X  book  X  set, which results in the same denotation as computed by the DCS tree in Figure 1, i.e. { John reads Ulysses ,... } . However, the point is that F 1 itself is an algebraic formula that does not depend on any concrete databases.
Formally, we introduce the following constants :  X  W : a universal set containing all entities.
Table 2: Abstract denotations and statements  X  Content words: a content word (e.g. read )
In addition we introduce following functions :  X   X  : the Cartesian product of two sets.  X   X  : the intersection of two sets.  X   X  r : projection onto domain of semantic role  X   X  r : relabeling (e.g.  X  OBJ ( book ) = book OBJ ).  X  q r  X  : the division operator, where q r  X  ( A,B ) is An abstract denotation is then defined as finite ap-plications of functions on either constants or other abstract denotations. 2.3 Statements As the semantics of DCS trees is formulated by abstract denotations, the meanings of declarative sentences are represented by statements on ab-stract denotations. Statements are declarations of some relations among abstract denotations, for which we consider the following set relations: Non-emptiness A 6 =  X  : the set A is not empty. Subsumption A  X  B : set A is subsumed by B . 3 Roughly speaking, the relations correspond to the logical concepts satisfiability and entailment .
Abstract denotations and statements are conve-nient for representing semantics of various types of expressions and linguistic knowledge. Some 2.4 Logical inference on DCS Based on abstract denotations, we briefly describe our process to apply DCS to textual inference. 2.4.1 Natural language to DCS trees To obtain DCS trees from natural language, we (Socher et al., 2013), and convert Stanford depen-dencies to DCS trees by pattern matching on POS the following semantic roles: ARG , SUBJ , OBJ , IOBJ , TIME and MOD . The semantic role MOD is used for any restrictive modifiers. Determiners such as  X  X ll X ,  X  X very X  and  X  X ach X  trigger quanti-fiers, as shown in Figure 2. 2.4.2 DCS trees to statements A DCS tree T = ( N , E ) is defined as a rooted tree, where each node  X   X  N is labeled with a content word w (  X  ) and each edge (  X , X  0 )  X  E  X  N  X  N is labeled with a pair of semantic roles ( r,r 0 ) 7 . Here  X  is the node nearer to the root. Furthermore, for each edge (  X , X  0 ) we can optionally assign a quantification marker.

Abstract denotation of a DCS tree can be cal-culated in a bottom-up manner. For example, the abstract denotation of H in Figure 2 is calculated from the leaf node Mary , and then: Node love ( Mary loves ): Node animal ( Animal that Mary loves ): Node have ( Tom has an animal that Mary loves ): Formally, suppose the root  X  of a DCS tree T has children  X  1 ,..., X  n , and edges (  X , X  1 ) ,..., (  X , X  n abstract denotation of T is defined as: [[ T ]] = w (  X  )  X  ( where T  X  R  X  is the set of possible semantic roles for con-tent word w (  X  ) (e.g. R love = { SUBJ , OBJ } ), and W R  X  \ r i is the product of W which has dimension R
When universal quantifiers are involved, we need to add division operators to the formula. If (  X , X  i ) is assigned by a quantification marker [[ T ]] = q r i  X  (  X  R where T 0 is the same tree as T except that the edge (  X , X  i ) is removed. For example, the ab-stract denotation of the first sentence of T in Fig-ure 2 ( Mary loves every dog ) is calculated from F 2 ( Mary loves ) as
After the abstract denotation [[ T ]] is calcu-lated, the statement representing the meaning of the sentence is defined as [[ T ]] 6 =  X  . For ex-ample, the statement of  X  students read books  X  is read  X  ( student SUBJ  X  book OBJ ) 6 =  X  , and the statement of  X  Mary loves every dog  X  is  X  (  X  OBJ ( F 2 ) , dog ) 6 =  X  , which is logically equivalent to dog  X   X  OBJ ( F 2 ) . 10 2.4.3 Logical inference Since meanings of sentences are represented by statements on abstract denotations, logical infer-ence among sentences is reduced to deriving new relations among abstract denotations. This is done by applying axioms to known statements, and ap-proximately 30 axioms are implemented (Table 3). These are algebraic properties of abstract denota-tions, among which we choose a set of axioms that can be handled efficiently and enable most com-mon types of inference seen in natural language.
For the example in Figure 2, by constructing the following abstract denotations: Tom has a dog : Objects that Tom has : we can use the lexical knowledge dog  X  animal , the statements of T (i.e. dog  X   X  OBJ ( F 2 ) and F 6 6 =  X  ), and the axioms in Table 3, 11 to prove the statement of H (i.e. F 4 6 =  X  ) (Figure 3).
We built an inference engine to perform logical inference on abstract denotations as above. In this logical system, we treat abstract denotations as terms and statements as atomic sentences , which are far more easier to handle than first order pred-icate logic (FOL) formulas. Furthermore, all im-plemented axioms are horn clauses, hence we can employ forward-chaining, which is very efficient. 2.5 Extensions Further extensions of our framework are made to deal with additional linguistic phenomena, as briefly explained below.
 Negation To deal with negation in our forward-chaining inference engine, we introduce one more relation on abstract denotations, namely disjoint-ness A k B , meaning that A and B are dis-joint sets. Using disjointness we implemented two types of negations: (i) atomic negation, for each content word w we allow negation  X  w of that word, characterized by the property w k  X  w ; and (ii) root negation, for a DCS tree T and its denotation [[ T ]] , the negation of T is represented by T kT , mean-ing that T =  X  in its effect.
 Selection Selection operators in relational alge-bra select a subset from a set to satisfy some spe-cific properties. This can be employed to rep-resent linguistic phenomena such as downward monotonicity and generalized quantifiers. In the current system, we implement (i) superlatives, e.g. s highest ( mountain  X  ( W ARG  X  Asia MOD )) (the highest mountain in Asia) and (ii) numerics, e.g. s two ( pet  X  fish ) (two pet fish), where s f is a se-lection marker. Selection operators are imple-mented as markers assigned to abstract denota-tions, with specially designed axioms. For ex-ample superlatives satisfy the following property: A  X  B &amp; s highest ( B )  X  A  X  s highest ( B ) = s highest ( A ) . New rules can be added if necessary. Coreference We use Stanford CoreNLP to re-solve coreferences (Raghunathan et al., 2010), whereas coreference is implemented as a special type of selection. If a node  X  in a DCS tree T be-longs to a mention cluster m , we take the abstract denotation [[ T  X  ]] and make a selection s m ([[ T  X  ]]) , which is regarded as the abstract denotation of that mention. Then all selections of the same mention cluster are declared to be equal. Recognizing textual entailment (RTE) is the task of determining whether a given textual statement H can be inferred by a text passage T . For this, our primary textual inference system operates as: 1. For a T -H pair, apply dependency parsing 2. Perform rule-based conversion from depen-3. Use statements of T and linguistic knowledge
However, this method does not work for real-world datasets such as PASCAL RTE (Dagan et al., 2006), because of the knowledge bottleneck: it is often the case that the lack of sufficient lin-guistic knowledge causes failure of inference, thus the system outputs  X  X o entailment X  for almost all pairs (Bos and Markert, 2005).

The transparent syntax-to-semantics interface of DCS enables us to back off to NLP techniques during inference for catching up the lack of knowl-edge. We extract fragments of DCS trees as para-phrase candidates, translate them back to linguis-tic expressions, and apply distributional similar-ity to judge their validity. In this way, our frame-work combines distributional and logical seman-tics, which is also the main subject of Lewis and Steedman (2013) and Beltagy et al. (2013).

As follows, our full system (Figure 4) addition-ally invokes linguistic knowledge on-the-fly: 4. If H is not proven, compare DCS trees of T 5. Aligned paths are evaluated by a similar-6. Convert accepted path alignments into state-3.1 Generating path alignments On-the-fly knowledge is generated by aligning paths in DCS trees. A path is considered as joining two germs in a DCS tree, where a germ is defined as a specific semantic role of a node. For example, Figure 5 shows DCS trees of the following sen-tences (a simplified pair from RTE2-dev): T: Tropical storm Debby is blamed for deaths. H: A storm has caused loss of life.
 The germ OBJ ( blame ) and germ ARG ( death ) in DCS tree of T are joined by the underscored path. Two paths are aligned if the joined germs are aligned, and we impose constraints on aligned germs to inhibit meaningless alignments, as de-scribed below. 3.2 Aligning germs by logical clues Two germs are aligned if they are both at leaf nodes (e.g. ARG ( death ) in T and ARG ( life ) in H , Figure 5), or they already have part of their mean-ings in common, by some logical clues. Figure 5: Aligned paths (underscored by the solid lines) and aligned germs (joined by the dotted line)
To formulate this properly, we define the ab-stract denotation of a germ, which, intuitively, rep-resents the meaning of the germ in the specific sen-tence. The abstract denotation of a germ is defined in a top-down manner: for the root node  X  of a DCS tree T , we define its denotation [[  X  ]] T as the denotation of the entire tree [[ T ]] ; for a non-root node  X  and its parent node  X  , let the edge (  X , X  ) be labeled by semantic roles ( r,r 0 ) , then define Now for a germ r (  X  ) , the denotation is defined as the projection of the denotation of node  X  onto the specific semantic role r : [[ r (  X  )]] T =  X  r ([[  X  ]] T For example, the abstract denotation of germ ARG ( book ) in Figure 1 is defined as  X  ARG ( book  X   X 
OBJ ( read  X  ( student SUBJ  X  book OBJ ))) , meaning  X  books read by students  X . Similarly, denotation of germ OBJ ( blame ) in T of Figure 5 indicates the object of  X  blame  X  as in the sentence  X  Tropi-cal storm Debby is blamed for death  X , which is a tropical storm , is Debby , etc. Technically, each germ in a DCS tree indicates a variable when the DCS tree is translated to a FOL formula, and the abstract denotation of the germ corresponds to the set of consistent values (Liang et al., 2011) of that variable.

The logical clue to align germs is: if there exists an abstract denotation, other than W , that is a su-perset of both abstract denotations of two germs, then the two germs can be aligned. A simple ex-ample is that ARG ( storm ) in T can be aligned to ARG ( storm ) in H , because their denotations have a common superset other than W , namely  X  ARG ( storm ) . A more complicated example is that OBJ ( blame ) and SUBJ ( cause ) can be aligned, because inference can induce [[ OBJ ( blame )]] T = [[ ARG ( Debby )]] T = [[ ARG ( storm )]] T , as well as [[ SUBJ ( cause )]] H = [[ ARG ( storm )]] H , so they also have the common superset  X  ARG ( storm ) . How-ever, for example, logical clues can avoid align-ing ARG ( storm ) to ARG ( loss ) , which is obviously Figure 6: Tree transformation and generated on-the-fly knowledge (subsumption of denotations shown above the trees) meaningless. 3.3 Scoring path alignments by similarity Aligned paths are evaluated by a similarity score, for which we use distributional similarity of the words that appear in the paths (  X  4.1). Only path alignments with high similarity scores can be ac-cepted. Also, we only accept paths of length  X  5 , to prevent too long paths to be aligned. 3.4 Applying path alignments Accepted aligned paths are converted into state-ments, which are used as new knowledge. The conversion is done by first performing a DCS tree transformation according to the aligned paths, and then declare a subsumption relation between the denotations of aligned germs. For example, to ap-ply the aligned path pair generated in Figure 5, we use it to transform T into a new tree T X  (Fig-ure 6), and then the aligned germs, OBJ ( blame ) in T and SUBJ ( cause ) in T X  , will generate the on-the-fly knowledge: [[ OBJ ( blame )]] T  X  [[ SUBJ ( cause )]] T X  .

Similar to the tree transformation based ap-proach to RTE (Bar-Haim et al., 2007), this pro-cess can also utilize lexical-syntactic entailment rules (Szpektor et al., 2007). Furthermore, since the on-the-fly knowledge is generated by trans-formed pairs of DCS trees, all contexts are pre-served: in Figure 6, though the tree transformation can be seen as generated from the entailment rule  X  X is blamed for death  X  X causes loss of life  X , the generated on-the-fly knowledge, as shown above the trees, only fires with the additional condition that X is a tropical storm and is Debby . Hence, the process can also be used to generate knowl-edge from context sensitive rules (Melamud et al., 2013), which are known to have higher quality (Pantel et al., 2007; Clark and Harrison, 2009).
However, it should be noted that using on-the-fly knowledge in logical inference is not a trivial task. For example, the FOL formula of the rule  X  X is blamed for death  X  X causes loss of life  X  is:  X  x ; (  X  a ; blame ( x,a ) &amp; death ( a ))  X  which is not a horn clause. The FOL formula for the context-preserved rule in Figure 6 is even more involved. Still, it can be efficiently treated by our inference engine because as a statement, the for-mula [[ OBJ ( blame )]] T  X  [[ SUBJ ( cause )]] T X  is an atomic sentence, more than a horn clause. In this section, we evaluate our system on FraCaS (  X  4.2) and PASCAL RTE datasets (  X  4.3). 4.1 Language Resources The lexical knowledge we use are synonyms, hy-We also add axioms on named entities, stopwords, numerics and superlatives. For example, named entities are singletons, so we add axioms such as  X  x ; ( x  X  Tom &amp; x 6 =  X  )  X  Tom  X  x .

To calculate the similarity scores of path align-ments, we use the sum of word vectors of the words from each path, and calculate the cosine similarity. For example, the similarity score of the path alignment  X  OBJ ( blame ) IOBJ -ARG ( death )  X  SUBJ ( cause ) OBJ -ARG ( loss ) MOD -ARG ( life ) X  is calculated as the cosine similarity of vectors blame + death and cause + loss + life . Other struc-tures in the paths, such as semantic roles, are ig-nored in the calculation. The word vectors we use are from Mikolov et al. (2013) 13 ( Mikolov13 ), and additional results are also shown using Turian et al. (2010) 14 ( Turian10 ). The threshold for ac-cepted path alignments is set to 0 . 4 , based on pre-experiments on RTE development sets. 4.2 Experiments on FraCaS The FraCaS test suite contains 346 inference prob-lems divided into 9 sections, each focused on a cat-egory of semantic phenomena. We use the data by MacCartney and Manning (2007), and experiment on the first section, Quantifiers , following Lewis and Steedman (2013). This section has 44 single premise and 30 multi premise problems. Most of the problems do not require lexical knowledge, so we use our primary textual inference system with-out on-the-fly knowledge nor WordNet, to test the performance of the DCS framework as formal se-mantics. To obtain the three-valued output (i.e. yes , no , and unknown ), we output  X  yes  X  if H is proven, or try to prove the negation of H if H is not proven. To negate H , we use the root negation as described in  X  2.5. If the negation of H is proven, we output  X  no  X , otherwise we output  X  unknown  X .
The result is shown in Table 4. Since our sys-tem uses an off-the-shelf dependency parser, and semantic representations are obtained from sim-ple rule-based conversion from dependency trees, there will be only one (right or wrong) interpre-tation in face of ambiguous sentences. Still, our system outperforms Lewis and Steedman (2013) X  X  probabilistic CCG-parser. Compared to MacCart-ney and Manning (2007) and MacCartney and Manning (2008), our system does not need a pre-trained alignment model, and it improves by mak-ing multi-sentence inferences. To sum up, the re-sult shows that DCS is good at handling universal quantifiers and negations.

Most errors are due to wrongly generated DCS trees (e.g. wrongly assigned semantic roles) or unimplemented quantifier triggers (e.g.  X  neither  X ) or generalized quantifiers (e.g.  X  at least a few  X ). These could be addressed by future work. 4.3 Experiments on PASCAL RTE datasets On PASCAL RTE datasets, strict logical inference is known to have very low recall (Bos and Markert, 2005), so on-the-fly knowledge is crucial in this setting. We test the effect of on-the-fly knowledge on RTE2, RTE3, RTE4 and RTE5 datasets, and compare our system with other approaches. 4.3.1 Impact of on-the-fly knowledge Results on test data are shown in Table 5. When only primary knowledge is used in inference (the first row), recalls are actually very low; After we activate the on-the-fly knowledge, recalls jump to over 50%, with a moderate fall of precision. As a result, accuracies significantly increase. 4.3.2 Comparison to other RTE systems A comparison between our system and other RTE systems is shown in Table 6. Bos06 (Bos and Markert, 2006) is a hybrid system combining deep features from a theorem prover and a model builder, together with shallow features such as lex-ical overlap and text length. MacCartney08 (Mac-Cartney and Manning, 2008) uses natural logic to calculate inference relations between two superfi-cially aligned sentences. Clark08 (Clark and Har-rison, 2008) is a logic-based system utilizing vari-ous resources including WordNet and DIRT para-phrases (Lin and Pantel, 2001), and is tolerant to partially unproven H sentences in some degree. All of the three systems pursue a logical approach, while combining various techniques to achieve ro-bustness. The result shows that our system has comparable performance. On the other hand, Wang10 (Wang and Manning, 2010) learns a tree-edit model from training data, and captures entail-ment relation by tree edit distance. Stern11 (Stern and Dagan, 2011) and Stern12 (Stern et al., 2012) extend this framework to utilize entailment rules as tree transformations. These are more tailored systems using machine learning with many hand-crafted features. Still, our unsupervised system outperforms the state-of-the-art on RTE5 dataset. 4.3.3 Analysis Summing up test data from RTE2 to RTE5, Fig-ure 7 shows the proportion of all proven pairs and their precision. Less than 5% pairs can be proven primarily, with a precision of 77%. Over 40% pairs can be proven by one piece of on-the-fly knowledge, yet pairs do exist in which more than 2 pieces are necessary. The precisions of 1 and 2 pieces on-the-fly knowledge application are over Figure 7: Proportion of proven pairs and their pre-cision, w.r.t. pieces of on-the-fly knowledge. 60%, which is fairly high, given our rough estima-tion of the similarity score. As a comparison, Dinu and Wang (2009) studied the proportion of proven pairs and precision by applying DIRT rules to tree skeletons in RTE2 and RTE3 data. The proportion is 8% with precision 65% on RTE2, and propor-tion 6% with precision 72% on RTE3. Applied by our logical system, the noisy on-the-fly knowl-edge can achieve a precision comparable to higher quality resources such as DIRT.

A major type of error is caused by the igno-rance of semantic roles in calculation of simi-larity scores. For example, though  X  Italy beats Kazakhstan  X  is not primarily proven from  X  Italy is defeated by Kazakhstan  X , our system does produce the path alignment  X  SUBJ ( beat ) OBJ  X  OBJ ( defeat ) SUBJ  X  with a high similarity score. The impact of such errors depends on the data making methodology, though. It lowers precisions in RTE2 and RTE3 data, particularly in  X  X E X  sub-task (where precisions drop under 0 . 5 ). On the other hand, it occurs less often in  X  X R X  subtask.
Finally, to see if we  X  X et lucky X  on RTE5 data in the choice of word vectors and thresholds, we change the thresholds from 0 . 1 to 0 . 7 and draw the precision-recall curve, using two types of word vectors, Mikolov13 and Turian10 . As shown in Figure 8, though the precision drops for Turian10 , both curves show the pattern that our system keeps gaining recall while maintaining precision to a cer-tain level. Not too much  X  X agic X  in Mikolov13 ac-tually: for over 80% pairs, every node in DCS tree of H can be covered by a path of length  X  5 that has a corresponding path of length  X  5 in T with a similarity score &gt; 0 . 4 . We have presented a method of deriving abstract denotation from DCS trees, which enables logi-cal inference on DCS, and we developed a textual inference system based on the framework. Exper-imental results have shown the power of the rep-resentation that allows both strict inference as on FraCaS data and robust reasoning as on RTE data.
Exploration of an appropriate meaning repre-sentation for querying and reasoning on knowl-edge bases has a long history. Description logic, being less expressive than FOL but featuring more efficient reasoning, is used as a theory base for Se-mantic Web (W3C, 2012). Ideas similar to our framework, including the use of sets in a repre-sentation that benefits efficient reasoning, are also found in description logic and knowledge repre-sentation community (Baader et al., 2003; Sowa, 2000; Sukkarieh, 2003). To our knowledge, how-ever, their applications to logical inference beyond the use for database querying have not been much explored in the context of NLP.

The pursue of a logic more suitable for natural language inference is not new. For instance, Mac-Cartney and Manning (2008) has implemented a model of natural logic (Lakoff, 1970). While being computationally efficient, various inference patterns are out of the scope of their system.
Much work has been done in mapping natu-ral language into database queries (Cai and Yates, 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013; Poon, 2013). Among these, the (  X  -)DCS (Liang et al., 2011; Berant et al., 2013) framework defines algorithms that transparently map a labeled tree to a database querying procedure. Essentially, this is because DCS trees restrict the querying process to a very limited subset of possible operations. Our main contribution, the abstract denotation of DCS trees, can thus be considered as an attempt to charac-terize a fragment of FOL that is suited for both natural language inference and transparent syntax-semantics mapping, through the choice of opera-tions and relations on sets.

We have demonstrated the utility of logical in-ference on DCS through the RTE task. A wide variety of strategies tackling the RTE task have been investigated (Androutsopoulos and Malaka-siotis, 2010), including the comparison of surface strings (Jijkoun and De Rijke, 2005), syntactic and semantic structures (Haghighi et al., 2005; Snow et al., 2006; Zanzotto et al., 2009; Burchardt et al., 2009; Heilman and Smith, 2010; Wang and Manning, 2010), semantic vectors (Erk and Pad  X  o, 2009) and logical representations (Bos and Mark-ert, 2005; Raina et al., 2005; Tatu and Moldovan, 2005). Acquisition of basic knowledge for RTE is also a huge stream of research (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Sudo et al., 2003; Szpektor et al., 2004; Fujita et al., 2012; Weis-man et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2013). These previ-ous works include various techniques for acquir-ing and incorporating different kinds of linguistic and world knowledge, and further fight against the knowledge bottleneck problem, e.g. by back-off to shallower representations.

Logic-based RTE systems employ various ap-proaches to bridge knowledge gaps. Bos and Markert (2005) proposes features from a model builder; Raina et al. (2005) proposes an abduction process; Tatu and Moldovan (2006) shows hand-crafted rules could drastically improve the perfor-mance of a logic-based RTE system.

As such, our current RTE system is at a proof-of-concept stage, in that many of the above tech-niques are yet to be implemented. Nonetheless, we would like to emphasize that it already shows performance competitive to state-of-the-art sys-tems on one data set (RTE5). Other directions of our future work include further exploitation of the new semantic representation. For example, since abstract denotations are readily suited for data querying, they can be used to verify newly gen-erated assumptions by fact search in a database. This may open a way towards a hybrid approach to RTE wherein logical inference is intermingled with large scale database querying.
