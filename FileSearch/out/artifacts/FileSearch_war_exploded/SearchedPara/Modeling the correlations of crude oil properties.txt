 1. Introduction
Characterization of reservoir fluids plays a very crucial role in developing a strategy on how to produce and operate a reservoir.
Pressure X  X olume X  X emperature (PVT) properties are very crucial for geophysics and petroleum engineers, namely for the utilization in material balance calculations, inflow performance calculations, well log analysis, determining oil reserve estimations and the amount of oil that can be recovered, the flow rate of oil or gas and the simulations on reservoir outputs. The phase and volumetric behavior of petroleum reservoir fluids are referred to as PVT ( Omole et al., 2009; Osman and Al-Marhoun, 2005 ).

PVT properties include formation volume factor (FVF), solution gas X  X il ratio (GOR), solution oil X  X as ratio (OGR), liquid specific gravity, American petroleum institute (API) specific gravity, gas specific gravity, bubble-point press ure, saturation pressure, etc. (Standing, 1962) . Among those PVT proper ties, the bubble-point ones, because they are the most es sential factors in reservoir and production computations ( Standing, 1962 ). The more the preciseness of estimating these properties, the b etter the calculations involved in reservoir simulation,production andfielddevelopment. Bubble-point the solution at constant temperature, while oil formation volume factor ( B ob )isdefinedasthevolumeofreservoiroilthatwouldbe occupied by one stock tank barrel oil plus any dissolved gas at the bubble point pressure and reservoir temperature as stated in Osman and Al-Marhoun (2005) , Kumoluyi and Daltaban (1994) , Goda et al. (2003) and El-Sebakhy (2009 ).

Ideally, these properties are determined from laboratory studies on samples collected from the bottom of the wellbore or on the surface. However, such experimental data is very costly to obtain and the accuracy of the result is critical and not often known in advance.
One of the solutions is to use the empirically derived correlations, which have been developed using equation of state (EOS), linear/ non-linear statistical regression or graphical techniques ( Osman and Al-Marhoun, 2005; El-Sebakhy, 2009 ). Unfortunately, these correlations are constrained by several limitations namely, the equation of state requires the extensive knowledge of the detailed compositions of the reservoir flu ids and the determination of such quantities is expensive and time-consuming; the accuracy of the EOS depends heavily on the nature of the fluid, on the type of equation selected and on the operator-d ependent tuning procedures.
This method also involves several numerical computations . To overcome the shortcomings associated with the earlier correlation methods, researchers made use of artificial intelligence based methods foremost of which is the classical artificial neural network (ANN) and its variants. But still, the developed neural networks X  correlations often do not perform to expectations and are bedeviled with shortcomings that include, among others, instability, with its non-homogeneous nature such that very different learning curves were obtained for different repeats of same experiment and its characteristic low speed operation.

In order to alleviate some of the limitations of the classical ANN, recently, sensitivity based linear learning method (SBLLM) has been introduced as a learning technique for two-layer feedforward neural networks based on sensitivity analysis that uses a linear training algorithm for each of the two layers ( Castillo et al., 2006 ).
This algorithm tends to provide good generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed, while in addition, it gives the sensitivities of the sum of squared errors with respect to the input and output data without extra computational cost. It is very stable in performance as its learning curve stabilizes soon, and behaves homogeneously not only if we consider just the end of the learning process, but also during the whole process, in such a way that very similar learning curves were obtained for all iterations of different experiments ( Castillo et al., 2004, 2006 ). Empirical results from simulations demonstrated that the SBLLM produced good general-ization performance, with high stability and consistency, which are requisites of good prediction models in reservoir characterization and modeling.

Therefore, this paper investigates the feasibility of using SBLLM in forecasting PVT properties of crude oil systems and propose a method to predict bubble point pressure ( P b ) and oil formation volume factor ( B ob ) using different standard databases of four input parameters, namely, solution gas X  X il ratio, reservoir temperature, oil gravity and gas relative density using sensitivity based linear learning method (SBLLM). We investigate earlier commonly used standard neural networks and the three common empirical corre-lations that include Standing (1947) correlation, Glaso (1980) correlation and Al-Marhoun (1992) correlation, in order to com-parewiththe SBLLMintermsoftheirperformanceinpredictingthe
PVT properties. Then we compare the proposed method in pre-dicting PVT properties using three distinct databases, based on the forecasting performance using several kinds of evaluation criteria and quality measures, with neural network and the three common empirical correlations.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief literature review and Section 3 presents the proposed intelligence frameworks based on SBLLM. Section 4 provides data acquisition, statistical quality measures used, empirical study, implementations process and deep comparative studies.
Results and discussions are also presented in Section 4. The conclusion and future work recommendations are provided in
Section 5. 2. Literature review
In the past few decades, engineers realized the importance of developingand using empirical correlationsfor PVTproperties. The development of correlations for PVT calculations has been the subject of extensive research, resulting in a large volume of publications. In this section, we briefly review the most common empirical PVT correlations and the related prediction approach together with the measurement techniques that have been used in forecasting these PVT properties. 2.1. Common empirical models and evaluation studies
Standing (1947 ) presented correlations for bubble point pressure and oil formation volume factor. The correlations were based on laboratory experiments carried ou t on 105 samples from 22 different crude oils in California. Glaso ( 1980 ) developed the Glaso empirical correlation for formation volume factor using 45 oil samples from North Sea hydrocarbon mixtures. Al-Marhoun ( 1992 ) published his second correlation for oil formation volume factor. The correlation was developed with 11,728 experimentally obtained formation volume factors at, above, and below bubble point pressure. The dataset represented samples from more than 700 reservoirs from all over the world, mostly from Middle East and North America. For more empirical correlation-related work, discussion, applications and comparative studies, interested readers can see Labedi (1990) , Dokla and Osman (1992) , Al-Yousef and Al-Marhoun (1993) , Macary and El-Batanoney (1992) , Saleh et al. (1987) , Omar and Todd (1993) , Petrosky and Farshad (1993) , Kartoatmodjo and Schmidt (1994) , Almehaideb, (1997) , McCain, (1991) , Elsharkawy et al., (1995) , Mahmood and Al-Marhoun, (1996) , Hanafy et al. (1997) , Al-Shammasi (1997, 2001) , Bello and Reinicke Patil (2008) and Ikiensikimama and Ogboja (2009 ). 2.2. Predicting PVT properties based on artificial neural networks
Artificial intelligence schemes have been increasingly used in the field of PVT properties and other fields in oil and gas industry during the last few decades, the most popular of which is the neural networks. Artificial neural networks are parallel-distributed infor-mation processing models that can recognize highly complex patterns within available data. In recent years, neural networks have gained popularity in petroleum applications. Many authors have discussed the applications of neural networks in petroleum engineering (see Omole et al., 2009; Kumoluyi and Daltaban, 1994; Mohaghegh, 2000; Mohaghegh and Ameri, 1994; Ali, 1994; Moghadassi et al., 2009; Hassanzadeh et al., 2008 , for details). Recently, it has been shown in both machine learning and data mining communities that artificial neural networks have the capacity to learn complex linear/non-linear relationships amongst input and output data. The most common widely used neural network in literature is known as the feedforward neural networks with backpropagation training algorithm ( Duda et al., 2001 ). This type of neural networks is an excellent computational intelligence modeling scheme in both prediction and classification tasks. Recently, feedforward neural networks were used to predict the PVT correlations ( Omole et al., 2009; Abdolreza et al., 2008; Osman et al., 2001; Gharbi and Elsharkawy, 1997 ).

The authors in Varotsis et al. (1999 ) introduced a novel approach for predicting the complete PVT behavior of reservoir oils and gas condensates using a non-iterative approach. The method uses key measurements that can be performed rapidly either in the lab or at the well-site as an input to a neural network, while in Gharbi and Elsharkawy (1997 ), two neural networks were trainedseparatelytoestimatethebubblepointpressure( P b )andoil formation volume factor ( B ob ), respectively. The input data were solution gas X  X il ratio, reservoir temperature, oil gravity and gas relative density, while making use of two hidden layer (2HL) neural networks: the first neural network (4-8-4-2), to predict the bubble point pressure and the second neural network (4-6-6-2), to predict the oil formation volume factor. Both neural networks were built using a dataset of size 520 observations from Middle East area. The input dataset was divided into a training set of 498 observations and a testing set of 22 observations.

The authors in Kumoluyi and Daltaban (1994 ) used the feedforward learning scheme with log sigmoid transfer function in order to estimate the formation volume factor at the bubble point pressure, using the data published in Osman et al. (2001 ), while the authors in Al-Marhoun and Osman (2002 ) developed two new models to predict the bubble point pressure and the oil formation volume factor at the bubble-point pressureforSaudi crudeoils.Themodelswerebased on artificialneural networks, and developed using 28 3 unpublished datasets collected from different Saudi fields. Recently, Moghadassi et al. (2009 )madeuse of neural network to predict the PVT properties. As usual, they were confronted with the generic problems of the standard neural network like local minima convergence problem, trial and error syndrome, instability and inconsistency.

For further works on the utilization of neural networks and its variants, such as radial basis function network, support vector machines and abductive network, for predicting PVT properties, interested readers can refer to Omole et al. (2009) , Osman and Al-Marhoun (2005) , El-Sebakhy (2009) , Hassanzadeh et al. (2008) , Abdolreza et al. (2008, 2009) , Elsharkawy (1998) , Osman (2002 and
El-Sebakhy et al. (2007 ). 3. Sensitivity-based linear learning method (SBLLM)
In Castillo et al. (2006 ), the authors proposed a new learning schemeinordertobothspeedupandavoidlocalminimaconvergence of the existing backpropagation lea rning technique, while alleviating its other common weaknesses such as instability and inconsistency.
This new learning strategy is called the sensitivity based linear learning method (SBLLM) scheme. It is a learning technique for two-layer feedforward neural networks based on sensitivity analysis, random values are assigned to the outputs of the first layer; later, these initial values are updated based on sensitivity formulas, which use the weights in each of the layers and the process is repeated until convergence. Since these weights are learnt solving a linear system of equations, there is an important saving in computational time. The method also gives the local sensitiv ities of the least squared errors with respect to input and output data, with no extra computational cost, because the necessary informat ion becomes available without extra calculations. This new scheme can also be used to provide an initial set of weights, which significantly improves the behavior of other learning algorithms. The full theoretical basis for SBLLM and its performance has been demonstrated in Castillo et al. (2006 ), which contains its application to several learning problems X  examples in which it is compared with several learning algorithms using well-known published datasets. The results have shown a learning speed generally faster than other existing methods.

Sensitivity analysis is a very useful technique for deriving how andhowmuchthe solutiontoa givenproblem dependsondata, see
Castillo et al. (2004, 1999, 1997 ) and the references therein for more details. However, in Castillo et al. (2006 ) it was shown that sensitivity formulas can also be used as a novel supervised learning algorithm for two-layer feedforward neural networks that present a high convergence speed.

Generally, SBLLM process is based on the use of the sensitivities of each layer X  X  parameters with respect to its inputs and outputs and also on the use of independent systems of linear equations for each layer to obtain the optimal values of its parameters. In addition, it gives the sensitivities of the sum of squared errors with respect to the input and output data. 3.1. The proposed PVT properties prediction model using sensitivity based linear learning method
Consider the two-layer feedforward neural network in Fig. 1 , where I is the number of inputs and includes the four PVT properties independent variables, namely solution gas X  X il ratio, reservoir temperature, oil gravity and gas relative density; J is the number of outputs, and it includes the two target PVT properties (dependent variables), namely bubble point pressure ( P b formation volume factor ( B ob ); K is the number of hidden units; x  X  1, z 0 s  X  1, S is the number of data samples and the superscripts (1) and (2) are used to refer to the first and second layers, respectively.

This network can be considered to be composed of two one-layer neural networks as it is shown in Fig. 2 .

Considering the one-layer network in Fig. 2 , the set of equations relating inputs and outputs is given by y  X  f where I is the number of inputs, J is the number of outputs, x w are the weights associated with neuron j and S is the number of data points.

To learn the weight w ji , the following sum of squared errors between the real and the desired output of the networks is usually
Z
Z output
Z minimized as P  X 
Assuming that the non-linear activation functions, f j , are invertible (which is the case for most of the commonly employed functions), otherwise, one can minimize the sum of squared errors before the non-linear activation functions ( Castillo et al., 2006 ), that is Q  X  which leads to the system of equations: @ Q @ w That is, or where
A  X  b  X 
Furthermore, for the one-layer neural network shown in Fig. 2 , according to Castillo et al. (2006, 2004, 1997 ), the sensitivities of the new cost function, Q , with respect to the input and output data can be obtained as @ Q @ y @ Q @ x
The learning method and the sensitivity formulas presented above can now be used to develop the SBLLM learning method for the two-layer feedforward networks shown in Fig. 1 . Now, consider the two-layer feedforward neural network in Fig. 1 , where I is the numberofinputsandincludesthefourPVTpropertiesindependent variables, namely solution gas X  X il ratio, reservoir temperature, oil gravity and gas relative density; J is the number of outputs, and it includes the two target PVT properties (dependent variables), namely bubble point pressure ( P b ) and oil formation volume factor ( B ob ); K is the number of hidden units; x 0 s  X  1, z 0s  X  1, S is the number of data samples and the superscripts (1) and (2) are used to refer to the first and second layers, respectively.

Assuming that the intermediate layer outputs z are known, using Eq. (3), a new cost function for the two-layer feedforward neural network in Fig. 1 is defined as Q  X  z  X  X  Q  X  1  X   X  z  X  X  Q  X  2  X   X  z  X 
Thus, using the outputs z ks we can learn, for each layer linear system of Eq. (4). After this, the sensitivity (see Eqs. (5) and (6)) with respect to z ks are calculated thus as @ Q @ z with k  X  1, y , K ,as z 0 s  X  1, 8 s . After this, the values of the intermediate outputs z are modified using the Taylor series approximation: Q  X  z  X  D z  X  X  Q  X  z  X  X  which leads to the following increments: D z  X  r Q  X  z  X  : r Q : 2 r Q  X  10  X  where r is a relaxation factor or step size.
The algorithmic steps of the proposed SBLLM based intelligent technique for predicting PVT properties is presented in Table 1 .
The above algorithmic steps of the proposed sensitivity based linear learning method (SBLLM) for predicting PVT properties of crude oil systems are further represented in the flowchart of Fig. 3 to ensure more clarity and easy understanding. 4. Empirical study, discussion and comparative studies
In order to carry out an empirical study, three distinct databases were acquired. To evaluate the performance of each modeling scheme, the entire databasewas divided, usingthestratifiedsampling entire dataset) was used for training and building SBLLM model (internal validation) while the testing set (remaining 30%) was used for testing and validating the model (external validation or cross-validation criterion). Generally, once the SBLLM has been trained, the calibration model becomes ready for testing and evaluation using the cross-validation criterion. For testing and evaluation of the newly developed framework, and to carry out effective comparative studies viz-a-viz the standard neural networks and the three commonly published empirical correlations: namely,
Standing ( 1947 ), Glaso ( 1980 ) and Al-Marhoun ( 1992 ) empirical correlations, the most common statistical quality measures that are utilized in both petroleum engineering and data mining journals were employed in this study. 4.1. Acquired datasets
For this study, three distinct datasets have been acquired. The complete databases were earlier utilized in distinct published research articles. They include: (a) 160 observations-database; (b) 283 observations-database; and (c) 782 observations-database.
Details of each are as follows: (a) 160-dataset: This first database was drawn from the article ( Al-Marhoun, 1988 ), containing published correlations for estimating bubble point pressure and oil formation volume factor for Middle Eastern oils. This database contains 160 observation data drawn from Middle Eastern reservoirs. (b) 283-dataset : This second database was contained in the works of Kumoluyi and Daltaban (1994) and Al-Marhoun and Osman (2002 ). This database has 283 data points collected from different Saudi fields to predict the bubble point pressure and the oil formation volume factor at the bubble-point pressure for Saudi crude oils. (c) 782-dataset : This third database was obtained from the works of Goda et al. (2003) and Osman et al. (2001 ), This database contains 782 observations after removing the redundant 21 observations from the actual 803 data points. This dataset was gathered from Malaysia, the Middle East, the Gulf of Mexico and Colombia.

One of the unique attributes of the three databases is that they all share the same input attributes (independent variables) and these include gas X  X il ratio, API oil gravity, relative gas density and reservoir temperature. 4.2. Statistical quality measures
Different quality measures can be used to judge the performance and accuracy of the models. This is done by carrying out statistical error analysis. To evaluate and compare the performance and accuracy of the proposed SBLLM models with the earlier mentioned standard neural networks and the three common empirical correlations in literatures, the most common statistical quality measures that are utilized in both petroleum engineering and data mining journals, namely the average percent relative error ( E ), average absolute percent relative error ( E a ), minimum and maximum absolute percent error ( E min and E max , respectively), standard deviation (SD) and correlation coefficient ( R 2 employed, see Duda et al. (2001) and Osman et al. (2001 ) for details regarding their mathematical formulae. 4.3. Implementation process
In this study, the three datasets earlier described were utilized in both the internal and external validation process by dividing each to 70% training set (internal validation) and 30% testing set (external validation). The training sets were used for building the
SBLLM calibration model while the remaining 30% were employed for the cross-validation process to evaluate its performance, accuracy and trend stability. Thereafter the capability of the developed calibration model, for new unseen observations, was fully investigated in forecasting both oil formation volume factor and bubble point pressure using the same four input parameters, namely solution gas X  X il ratio, gas relative density, oil gravity reservoir and reservoir temperature.

For both internal and external validation processes, different quality control and statistical measures were calculated to compare the performance and accuracy of the new SBLLM based intelligent framework and those of the standard neural network and the three most popular empirical correlations in published literatures viz: Standing, Glaso and Al-Marhoun empirical correla-tions. The obtained results throughout the entire process are presented shortly in tables and figures.

In initializing the used parameters for the standard neural network, procedures similar to those in Osman et al. (2001 ) were followed. A single hidden layer feedforward neural network based on backpropagation (BP) learning algorithm with both linear and sigmoid activation functions. The initial weights were generated randomly as usual with learning epoch set to 1000 or 0.001 goal error and 0.01 learning rate. Each layer contains neurons that are connectedto all neuronsinthe neighboringlayers.Theconnections have numerical values (weights) associated with them, which will be adjusted during the training phase in line with the standard trainingproceduresof ANN.Forboththe B ob and P b models, thefirst layer consists of four neurons representing the input values of the independent variables that include solution gas X  X il ratio, gas specific gravity, American Petroleum Institute (API) oil gravity and reservoir temperature. The second (hidden) layer consists of seven neurons for the P b model, and eight neurons for the B model.Thethird layercontains oneneuronrepresentingtheoutput valuesofthetargetvariablewhichiseither P b or B ob inthiscase.The schematic diagram of the used neural networks for P b and B models are already well illustrated in Osman et al. (2001) and Al-Marhoun and Osman (2002 ).

For the SBLLM based models, the implementation process was started by feeding the SBLLM model with the available input datasets, one observation at a time, which in this case includes solution gas X  X il ratio, gas specific gravity, API oil gravity and reservoir temperature.
Logsig and sigmoid transformation functions were applied. The number of hidden neuron and the epoch were both set to 100. Further details on the workings of SBLLM have been presented in
Section 3. 4.4. Results and discussions
The results of comparisons using external validation checks have been summarized in Tables 2 through 7 . The results from
SBLLM based modeling scheme outperformed the standard neural network and the other correlationmethods presented, especially in terms of stability as indicated by its lowest standard deviation throughout the reported results. The proposed model showed a high accuracy in predicting both B ob and P b values with a stable and accurate performance and achieved the lowest standard deviation in all cases, the lowest absolute percent relative error and the highest correlation coefficient in most cases among all the pre-sented correlations for the three distinct databases used. Detail discussion of the results follows shortly.

Results summarized in Tables 2 through 7 are further repre-sented in scatter plots of Figs. 4 and 5 to facilitate making  X  X t a glance decision X  on which of the methods presented is better in performance. Also, Figs. 6 through 8 show sample cross plots indicating the variation of predicted and actual PVT properties for the SBLLM model implemented. These cross plots indicate the degree of agreement between the experimental and the predicted values based on the high quality performance of the SBLLM. It can be noticed from these plots that the SBLLM prediction curve seems to pass through most of the target data points, which indicates the ability of SBLLM to predict PVT properties with high accuracy. For thesakeofbrevity,thereadercan comparethesespatternswiththe corresponding ones of the published neural networks modeling and the common empirical correlations in Osman and Al-Marhoun (2005) and Al-Marhoun and Osman (2002 ).

As shown in Figs. 4 and 5 , six scatter plots are drawn for the three distinct databases used. These graphs show the measure-ments of correlation coefficient ( R 2 ), standard deviation (SD) and absolute percent relative error ( E a ) for SBLLM based model, feedforward neural networks and the three empirical correlations.
Each modeling scheme is represented by a unique symbol; a good forecasting scheme should have the highest correlation coefficient, the lowest standard deviation and the lowest absolute percent relative error.

From the table and plots presented, it could be easily observed, for instance, in estimating B ob based on the 160-dataset used in
Al-Marhoun (1988 ), that SBLLM based model has the smallest standard deviation, SD  X  0.09154, the largest correlation coeffi-cient, R 2  X  0.995 and the smallest absolute percent relative error,
E  X  1.200%, while the neural network is below SBLLM scheme with
SD  X  0.89835, R 2  X  0.993 and E a  X  1.209%. The other empirical correlations indicate higher error values and standard deviation with lower correlation coefficients as Standing 1947 correlation has SD  X  2.5823, R 2  X  0.974, E a  X  2.724%; Glaso (1980) correlation has SD  X  2.673, R 2  X  0.972, E a  X  2.673% and Al-Marhoun (1992) correlation has SD  X  1.2842, R 2  X  0.981, E a  X  2.205%. These indicate that in this particular case, SBLLM had 89.8% improvement over the best among the other models (which is ANN) and 96.6% over the poorest method in terms of standard deviation, which is a measure of stability and consistency of the models, while in terms of correlation coefficient, SBLLM had 0.2% improvement over the best among other models and 2.3% over the poorest method.
 Furthermore, in estimating P b based on the 160-dataset used in Al-Marhoun (1988 ), SBLLM based model has the smallest standard deviation, SD  X  4.06, the largest correlation coefficient, R one of the smallest absolute percent relative error, E a  X  35.54%, while the neural network is below SBLLM scheme with SD  X  0.4.744, R  X  0.943, E a  X  22.68%. The other empirical correlations indicate higher standard deviation with lower correlation coefficients as Standing (1947) correlation has SD  X  12.839, R 2  X  0.906, E Glaso (1980) correlation has SD  X  225.171, R 2  X  0.945, E Al-Marhoun (1992) correlation has SD  X  25.159, R 2  X  0.867, E  X  67.73%. Thus in this particular case, SBLLM had 12.4% improve-ment over the best among the other models (ANN) and 83.9% over the least-performance model in terms of standard deviation, which is a measure of stability and consistency of the models. While in terms of correlation coefficient, SBLLM had 1.91% improvement over the best among other models and 10.84% ove r the least-performance model. Moreover, in estimating B ob based on the 283-dataset ( Table 4 ), SBLLM has the smallest standard deviation, SD  X  0.0372, which represents 94.4% improvement over the best among the other methods (ANN) and 98.3% over the least-performance method. These huge improvements again point to the unique performance of SBLLM model as regards stability and consistency of prediction, which are requisites of good prediction model in reservoir modeling and engineering. In terms of correlation coefficient and absolute percent relative error, SBLLM compete favorably with other best methods, even though ANN was a little better in terms of absolute percent relative error with ANN having E a  X  0.6849 while 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 oil formation volume factor (Bob) -500 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50
Bubble-point pressure (Pb)
SBLLM had E a  X  0.852, but in terms of correlation coefficient they both stand at par. In addition, when estimating P b based on the 283-dataset ( Table 5 ), SBLLM has the smallest standard deviation,
SD  X  0.1427, which represent 98.4% improvement over the best among the other methods (i.e. ANN) and 99.1% improvement over the least-performance method. This huge improvements again point to the unique performance of SBLLM model as regards stability and consistency of prediction, which are requisites of good prediction model in reservoir modeling and engineering. In terms ofcorrelationcoefficientandabsolutepercentrelativeerror,SBLLM competes favorably with the other best methods.

Similarly, for the case involving estimating B ob based on the 782-dataset ( Table 6 ), SBLLM has the smallest standard deviation,
SD  X  0.4069, which represents 91.4% improvement over the best among other methods (ANN) and 92.9% over the least-performance method. This huge improvement in terms of standard deviation measure indicates the unique performance of SBLLM as regards stability and consistency of prediction, which are requisites of good prediction model in reservoir modeling and engineering. In terms ofcorrelationcoefficientandabsolutepercentrelativeerror,SBLLM compete favorably with others. Finally, as regards estimating P based on the 782-dataset ( Table 7 ), as usual, SBLLM has the smallest standard deviation, SD  X  1.3328, which represents 90.3% improvement over the best among the other methods and 93.7% over the least-performance method. This huge improvement in termsofstandarddeviationagainshowstheuniqueperformanceof SBLLM as regards stability and consistency of prediction.
From the overall reported experimental results, it could be easily observed that SBLLM performed outstandingly better especially in terms of stability and consistency compared to others. This is evident in the standard deviation of SBLLM model that happens to be the lowest in all the reported cases compared to others, with up to 98.4% improvement over the best among others and up to 99.1% over the least-performancemethod,insome cases.ThisindicatesthatSBLLMis able to deal with the nature of reservoir data consistently through its sensitivityanalysis,andatthesametime,veryconsistentandstablein its performance. Even though, in few cases, performance of ANN tends tocompetewith those ofSBLLMin termsofcorrelation coefficientand getting closer to SBLLM in terms of standard deviation. This further strengthened the fact that SBLLM is very stable and consistent in its performance always, and these dual characteristics (i.e. stability and consistence) are very crucial characteristics often sought for in any predictive model, particula rly in reservoir engineering and modeling.

Thus, the results emanating from this research, show that the proposed SBLLM based model for PVT properties estimation is able to adequately handle and predict data associated with reservoir modeling, and hence perform better than others, most of the time, while always achieving the best results in terms of stability and consistency as shown in its consistently lowest standard deviation. Finally, it could be concluded at this point that the developed SBLLM based modeling scheme for PVT properties prediction has better and reliable performance compared to the most published modeling schemes and empirical correlations. That is, the devel-oped SBLLM modeling scheme outperformed both the standard feedforward neural networks and the most commonly published empirical correlations when predicting both B ob and P b using the four input variables: gas relative density, solution gas X  X il ratio, oil gravity and reservoir temperature. 5. Conclusion and recommendations
In this study, three distinct published datasets were made use of in investigating the performance and accuracy of the newly developed SBLLM modeling scheme as a new framework for predicting the PVT properties of crude oil systems. The following conclusions and recommendations can be drawn based on previousanalysis,discussions,deepinvestigation,experimentsand comparative studies in this work.

A summarized review of different earlier works on PVT proper-ties estimation has been presented and then a new computational framework, based on SBLLM, proposed. This is to improve the estimation of those important PVT properties.

A new computational intelligence modeling scheme, based on the SBLLM, has been investigated, developed and implemented, as predictive solutions for predicting both bubble point pressure and oil formation volume factor using the four input variables of solution gas X  X il ratio, gas relative density, oil gravity and reservoir temperature. It is an established fact in the petroleum engineering communities that these two predicted properties were the most important PVT properties of crude oil systems, as opined in Standing (1962) , Kumoluyi and Daltaban (1994) , Goda et al.

In-depth comparative studies have been carried out between this new framework and the standard neural networks and the three commonly published empirical correlations, namely Standing (1947) , Glaso (1980) and Al-Marhoun (1992) empirical correlations. Empirical results from simulations show that SBLLM based model outperformed all the compared models or at least compete favorably with the best, while in terms of performance stability and consistency, SBLLM based model has no rival, as indicatedbyitsloweststandarddeviation,allthrough,comparedto others.

Based on the published literatures so far, it can be said here that for the first time in the history of PVT properties estimations, a new model based on SBLLM has been built that makes use of sensitivity analysis in generating the target forecast while also producing the local sensitivities of the least square errors with respect to input and output data without any extra computational cost.

As a form of future work recommendation, it is suggested that other models like that of permeability estimation, porosity, history matching, lithofacies andother reservoirengineeringproperties could be built using this framework. Furthermore, this new framework should be viewed as a viable application in the area of computational intelligence in machine learning and data mining with applications to different important branches such as bankruptcy prediction, Bubble-point pressure (Pb) target predicted bioinformatics, intrusion detention systems, stock markets, forensic science and lots more.
