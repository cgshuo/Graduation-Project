 Searching for prior-art patents is an essential step for the patent examiner to validate or invalidate a patent appli-cation. In this paper, we consider the whole patent as the query, which reduces the burden on the user, and also makes many more potential search features available. We explore how to automatically transform the query patent into an ef-fective search query, especially focusing on the effect of dif-ferent patent fields. Experiments show that the background summary of a patent is the most useful source of terms for generating a query, even though most previous work used the patent claims.

The goal of searching a patent database for prior-art is to find previously published patents on a given topic. It is a common task when the patent examiner needs to de-cide whether a patent application is novel. As a legal doc-ument for protecting the invention, a patent has complex structures and technical content, which can create signifi-cant challenges for the retrieval system. Furthermore, some additional factors can make the problem even worse. In or-der to extend the coverage of a patent, the writers often intentionally use vague words and expressions in the claim, which increases the difficulty of capturing the real content of a patent. Also, in order to pass the patent examination, writers tend to develop their own terminologies, which can cause serious word mismatch problems. The combination of these factors make prior-art search significantly different with other search tasks, such as web search.

Currently, patent retrieval sy stems use a typical keyword search approach, where the success of the prior-art search relies on the quality of the keywords posed by the user. In this paper, we consider a novel approach to patent search, where the user submits the whole patent application as the query. In this approach, the burden on the user is entirely shifted to the system. Given a patent query, the system will have full access to the abundant information contained in the patent, which can potentially make many more useful search features available. Larkey [1] studied how to transform a patent into a query for patent classification, however this approach has not been fully explored for prior-art search.
Specifically, we focus here on a study of the search features extracted from different fields of a patent. A typical patent contains the following fields: the title (ttl), the abstract (abst), the background summary (bsum), the description of the figures (drwd), the detailed description (detd) and the claims (clms). Most previous work on prior-art search [2, 3, 4] has used the words from the claim field as the query with-out examining other alternatives. Our results indicate that the words from the summary field are better than those from the claim field when used as queries for prior-art search.
In this paper, we consider wo rds extracted from differ-ent fields with different weig htsassearchfeatures. With the query patent available, many other features can be ex-tracted, which will be explored in the future. Fig. 1 shows the general algorithm for extracting query words, where the parameters Field , Num and Weight indicate where to ex-tract query words, how many query words should be kept, and what weighting methods are used, respectively. Table 1 list the possible values of these parameters. For the pa-rameter Weight , bool denotes assigning the weight 1 to all words. For the parameter Field , besides the fields mentioned above, we also consider the primary claim (pclm), which is the most important claim among all claims and the whole patent (all), where the query words are selected from the whole patent without considering the structure information. With different configurations of the parameter values, we obtain different search features.
 ALGORITHM : Extracting query words INPUT : Patent , Field , Num , Weight OUTPUT : Query
PROCESS : Rank words in Field accordingtotheir tfidf scores and then select Num top ranked words as the query words. Assign Weight to each query word to get Query .

The USPTO corpus we used consists of 1,604,386 patents published from 1980 to 1997. The query set consists of patents published in 1997 that have at least 20 citations and all field types mentioned above. The size of the query set is 3,736 and we randomly split it into a training set of 3,361 patents and a test set with 373 patents. Since it is ex-tremely difficult, perhaps even impossible, to get relevance judgments from experts for those thousands of queries, we use a patent X  X  citation field &lt; UREF &gt; as a substitute, which is the same as the strategy adopted by NTCIR5-6 1 . Indri is used to index the full text of patents in the collection. The Krovetz stemmer is used to stem each word and the stop-word is not removed. The standard mean average precision (MAP) and precision at 10 (P@10) are used to measure the retrieval performance. Two-tailed t-tests are conducted to decide statistical significance.
In this section, we report on the retrieval performance of different search features extracted in Section 2. Specifically, the effect of different configurations of the parameters Num , Weight and Field is compared. For the parameter Num ,we tested different values for Num from 10 to 50 for different fields, where Weight is set to bool . Results show that 10 words for the title field and 20 words for the other fields are enough to capture the most information, thus Num is set to 10 for the title field and 20 for the other fields.
The combinations of three Weight values and eight Field values were further explored. The results are shown in Table 2 . * denotes significantly different with both bool and tfidf .  X  denotes all values of  X  X sum X  are significantly different with the corresponding values of all other fields.

Table 2 shows that for most fields, tf is the best weighting method. tfidf is also better than bool , but not as clearly as tf . With respect to fields, it is clear that the words ex-tracted from the background summary field achieve the best http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/publication1-en.html
Here, due to the space limit, only the results on the test set are provided. The results on the training set are quite similar. performance (much better than the claim field) when used for generating queries. This observation can be explained by the properties of these two fields. The claim field is used for legal purpose, which defines the protection scope for this patent. Thus, authors tend to use language that extends the scope, such as  X  X obile unit X  instead of  X  X ehicle X . In con-trast, the summary field is mainly written for technical use. The authors typically review previous work and briefly de-scribe their patent relative to related work. It is therefore not unreasonable that the vocabulary used in this field is more effective for prior-art search. The abstract field is also a slightly better source for query words than the claim field. Using only the primary claim is not as effective as using all claims. Although the detailed description (detd) contains much more content than other fields, it seems not as useful as the claim field. The title field and the figure description field (drwd) are among the least effective. The performance of  X  X ll X  is also a good choice that is slightly better than the abstract field, but still worse than the summary field.
Prior-art search is an important task in the patent pro-cess. In contrast to a typical keyword search, in this paper we consider a search scenario where the user submits a whole patent (or application) as the query instead of selecting key-words. The abundant information contained in the query patent makes it possible to extract different search features. On the USPTO collection, we explored the effect of fields and weighting methods on prior-art search and showed the background summary field is a better source than the widely used claim field for generating query words. In the future, obtaining more reliable relevance judgments is the most im-portant issue. Other techniques for extracting concepts and entities from patent text should be further explored.
