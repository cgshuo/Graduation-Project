 In this paper we present resu lts of an NSF funded project on exploring and understanding cyber learning that happens in online open source software (OSS) communities for technical support. We look across multiple OSS support communities (Firefox, Java, and Koha) to understand the behavior of newcomers in these communities, the role that the community response plays in their continued participation and newcomer best practices. We found that newcomers are not a homogenous group and majority of them display  X  X odel X  behavior. We also found out that community response is critical for continued participation of newcomers. In our dataset, almost all non return ing newcomers can be attributed to receiving no reply or a condescending reply from the community. We found that one third of newcomers X  transition into a role of help givers in the co mmunity and demonstrate evidence of learning. We also highlight be st practices for newcomers to be successful in these online communities.

Open source software, newc omer integrations, online communities, virtual communities, learning, cyber learning, distance education. Online communities are an important part of everyday life for an ever growing number of people globally. One domain in which online communities have significant impact is online learning. Online learning communities have seen a dramatic increase through their adoption by for-profit as well as non-profit educational institutions. Research firm Ambient predicts that by 2014 the number of students taking a ll of their classes online will increase to 3.55 million, while the number of students taking all of their courses in on-campus classrooms will drop to 5.14 million. The Sloan Consortium found that 66 percent of postsecondary institutions were seeing an increased demand for new distance education course offerings and 73 percent were seeing an increased demand in their existing distance education coursework. Research in online classrooms has shown that the learning in these environments is influenced by a multitude of factors including the learning environment, the resources provided to the students, and the tools and technology used to deliver content [7]. One important factor that determines student success is their use of learning resources [7]. A learning resource is information or a tool that can be used to assist learners in the process of locating, recording, and processing the learning materials. In this study we investigate one such learning community  X  online forums of multiple open source software communities for technical support that specifically serve newcomers. Learning has emerged as a key motivational factor for particip ation in open source software development along with other f actors such as element of reciprocity and reputation in the co mmunity [15]. In this research, we connect these very distant research streams  X  learning and open source  X  as they can shed light on many issues of interest to CSCW scholars. In particular, we investigate characteristics of newcomers who join open source software technical support communities and how their characteris tics shape their participation and the response from the community. The growth and benefit of any cyber learning environment such as an online forum community depends on newcomer entry and sustained participation. Participation is essential for learning to occur and successful participation is itself a valuable learning experience. It is critical for online communities to ensure new members involve in the communities initially as lurkers or peripheral members and progress towards becoming core members. We conducted an exploratory st udy on online technical support forums for Mozilla Firefox, Java, and Koha to understand and classify practices and tools used to facilitate newcomer entry and continued participation, as well as the building of a learning community. We examined how newcomers seek help, how community guides them, and how a successful newcomer integrates and learns in a community. Such a study will contribute to fundamental theory on newcomer participation in cyber learning environments as well as theory on how tools successfully mediate learner-teacher or novice-expert relationships. Online communities are built around shared interests, which Zhang et al (2007) [19] define as  X  X dvice on medical treatment, programming, software, building a computer from scratch to repairing the kitchen sink. X  Such communities are of interest to many researchers as they  X  X lur the dichotomy between experts and seekers...such systems allow everyone to contribute as they can X . Communities of various topics and implementations are of interest to researchers, whether it is a community centered on questions and answers, social support, or discussion. One of the findings from Zhang et al is that the reason that a user replies to a topic is usually because of an interest in the co ntent of the topic rather than who between the original poster and the repliers. A crucial aspect of our research is the integration; acclimatization and involvement of newcomers into online communities. Several scholars have studied this in the context of both offline and online communities. Choi et al [5] studied the impact of socialization tactics in online communities on newcomer commitment, which was measured by the length of the stay in the communities. Commitment easier for members to leave online gr oups [8]. Choi et al found that standardized tactics were negatively associated with newcomers X  contributions, whereas personali zed tactics were positively associated with their contribution. With regards to open source communities, Ducheneaut [6] looks at socialization in OSS developer communities. The success of OS projects depends on the new contributors cannot get beyond a few lines of code. Furthermore, as OSS projects progress, the few people who have been actively involved are the only ones to understand the complex nature of the project. This make s socializing new members essential to the long-term survival of OSS projects. Ducheneneaut also found that the successful contribution to an OS project is less about technical expertise and more about construction of identities. Rather than  X  X nyone X  being able to contribute, only those who can present themselves as  X  X oftware craftsmen X  could reach developer status on a project. All participants are highly skilled developers, but the newcomers who could play the part well could progress to higher strata on the project. Burke, Kraut and Joyce [4] researched ways in which newcomers execute proactive socialization tactics within online communities and found that when users mention their presence on the forum in past, express their similarity to the groups by using same vernacular, and request information and received responses to their request, then the group was willing to integrate them in the community. This in return, meant that the newcomers w ill continue participating in the group. [16] von Krogh et al (2003) differentiated between  X  X oiners and newcomers X  and how the role changed once a user was given access to the developer community in the open source community Freenet. They analyzed the use of a  X  X oining script X  which is the type of activity a joiner must demonstrate to become a member of the developer community. In this study we build on these studies findings and try to add to the domain knowledge by developing a better understanding in the different types of newcomers and their characteristics. In terms of motivation of participation, Yang et al (2008) [18] analyzed  X  X itkeys, X  websites which offer monetary rewards for participation, found that surprisingly money does not provide an incentive for people to participate. Rather, other incentives such as prestige motivate users to participate. The nature of the question also matters. Adamic et al [1] found that questions posed in Yahoo Answers that were more factual in nature had shorter activity levels and less differentiation between helper and asker role. Questions that were more open in nature had  X  X onger threads, broader distribution of activity levels, and their users tended to participate by both posing and replying to questions X  (673). In [2] authors found newcomers exhibited primarily information seeking behavior while established members exhibited information-providing behavior. Most of these studies do not explicitly distinguish the differences among the newcomers and then the impact that those differences mi ght have on the integration of newcomers into the community. Wels er et al (2007) [17] used visualization strategies in order to deduce the various social roles in Usenet communities. Such a strategy allowed viewing all the  X  X ignatures X  of a social role within an online community, such as the author originations of answer and discussion people.  X  X nswer people X  are particularly important to analyze since their contributions are the direct contribution to creating  X  X aluable online resources. Welser et al (2007) found that answer people tend to reply to discussion threads initiate d by others and typically only contribute one or two messages per thread X . Whether an individual eventually becomes committed to th e group is likely to depend on the type of contributions the individual makes to the group and the responses the person gets after contributing. Prior studies have shown the importance and similarities of lurkers with the other social roles in online communities. [11] shows that the three major social roles of uploaders, contribu tors and lurkers engage in similar behavior and use similar tools in the communities and therefore lurkers should be seen as an important part of the discussion and design of online communities. In their research focusing on lurkers Mueller found that contribution and lurking are partially dependent on a person X  X  overall engagement and also modified by their disposition towards a particular topic, work task or a social group. They did not find any evidence of social learning theory as well as individual trait theory. [12]. Preece [14] provides a  X  X eader to leader X  framework for understanding the life cycle and participation of users in online communities and the progre ssion of their participation. According to their model the different social roles present in communities do not make a linear progression from one stage to the next but the social roles can change from one stage to another by skipping stages in the middle. analyze the help-seeking behaviors of various users within online communities. Zhang et al (2007) quantitatively analyzed the Java forums to understand the help-seeking behaviors and levels of expertise of various users. They found that algorithms could be produced to analyze expertise leve ls within the Java community. Such findings [21] could help to match users with a question list that matches their specific expertise level, which would presumably increase their participation. Such research originated when it was found that the Java online community has unequal participation where a few advanced users answer most questions. Yuan et al (2009) [19] also focus on how tools that can motivate participation in an online community. They suggest the implementation of an intelligent recommendation system to increase contribution to online communities. Nam et al [13] find altruism, lear ning, and competency are frequent motivations for top answerers to par ticipate, but that participation is often highly intermittent. Using a simple measure of user performance, we find that higher levels of participation correlate with better performance. The main research objective of this study is to find out what makes newcomers stay in an online community and if and how newcomers learn in these communities. We want ed to see the behavior of the newcomers as they enter these co mmunities as well as the behavior of the community members towa rds these newcomers. This research followed a grounded theory approach because it is exploratory in nature and we wa nted to develop an understanding of behaviors and underlying process in these communities. In this study data collection was done in phases and went hand in hand with data analysis. Based on the results of first phase of data analysis, further data collection and analysis was conducted. This type of data collection is called theoretical sampling and is a key step in grounded theory based res earch. It is con cept driven it helps researcher to discover the concepts that are relevant to the problem and population and allows researchers to explore the concepts in depth. This process is cumulative; the data collection depends on data analysis and contributes to the next data collection and analysis. We first identified and collected threads with newcomers and then we identified the newcomers in the threads and analyzed their behavior. Then we analyzed the responses that these newcomers received from the community and how that impacted their future participation on the forum. We also wanted to establish the characteristics of a successful newcomer. For this, we identified few successful newcomers from our data set and collected 50 threads corresponding to each successful newcomer. From these 50 threads we developed a profile of a successful newcomer. More details about the particulars of data collection and analysis are gi ven in relevant sections. Four main research questions were formulated as follows: RQ1: What is the overall behavior of newcomers when they enter an OSS online community? 1. What is the tone of the newcomer in their messages and 2. Does the newcomer exhibit any prior knowledge about the 3. Does the newcomer respond to the responder and/or 4. Do the newcomers use comprehendible language when 5. Do the newcomers demonstrate an initiative to learn? RQ2: What helps newcomers integrate into an OSS online community? For this question integration means newcomers stayed in the community beyond their first messa ge and came back and posted more messages. We wanted to see what impact the community response has on the continued par ticipation or longevity of these newcomers. So for this question we looked at the behavior of community members, referred to as respondents from here on, and the impact it had on the continued participation/integration of newcomers. 1. What happens to newcomers continued participation when 2. What happens to newcomers participation when the RQ3: Do newcomers learn in these communities, and if so, how does the learning occur? What helps newcomers learn and contribute to the community? We hypothesize that demonstrati on of learning occurred will be evident in the messages that the newcomers post overtime. Also, we believe that the ultimate demons tration of learning is when the newcomers feel confident enough to start giving help to others and in this way they contribute back to the community. So, for this question we looked at two things: 1. What are the changes in the content of the messages posted 2. How many newcomers change roles and become help givers? RQ4  X  What are best practices of successful newcomers? The answer to this question was a composite from all the previous analysis about newcomer behavi or and responses and additional parameters such as informative subject line, resilience, persistence, et c. were added. Data was collected in multiple stages from three different open source online technical support communities. Table 1 below provides a summary of the forums used to collect data. Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser. Two technical support forums for Mozilla Firefox were selected for data collection. One is a part of th e official Mozill a support page and Firefox is a web browser and the support community does not expect technical expertise from its users. Java is open-source software and the forum used for data collection was the Oracle forum hosted at forums.oracle.com. From all the forums available on this website, New to Java forum was chosen because it is meant to welcome/integrate people who are new to learning java as a programming language. The technical level of expertise needed in Java forums is higher that Firefox and some basic programming skills are expected from the users. Finally, Koha is an open-source integrated library system (ILS) and data was collected and anal yzed from their technical support forum at oldnabble.com. The users of Koha forums are librarians, developers and technical support representatives from commercial vendors who provide technical support for Koha. The expectations of the newcomers are awarene ss of Koha, its modules and functionalities, so in our opinion this is the intermediate forum to Java and Firefox. All three forums provided different contexts in which to analyze newcomer and responder behavior , with different and various levels of expertise in diff erent user populations. These communities were chosen so as to learn about the newcomers and how they learn. Such results would not be generalized to developer and developer communities, but rather how new users learn about software and demons trate this learning in online communities. For first phase of data collection, each of the four forums was searched using multiple keywords such as new, newbie, newcomer, noob, noobie, etc. Data Collection was done in June 2010 and the forums were searched up to January 2009, so in total 18 months of messages were browse d to collect the threads with the identified keywords in them. A newcomer thread was determined by reading the ope ning post and seeing if a user declared being new to a specific facet of a particular forum topic. A total of 60 threads were colle cted for Firefox technical support community (43 from MozillaZine and 15 from official Mozilla support site. Twenty four threads were collected New to Java forum and 47 threads were collected from Koha forum. For second phase, for the successful newcomer question, the top five posters from our Mozillazine dataset were identified and for each one of them 50 additional threads were collected. This type of data collection is called theoretical sampling and is a key step in grounded theory based research. In this case, based on our analysis of threads collected in phase one, we decided to dig deeper about individual characteristics of most prolific posters. These threads were coded and analyzed on both individual message level as well as overall thread level. These threads were used to get an understanding of the behavior of pr olific newcomers. Furthermore, the responses from the responders were also coded to get an overall picture of the particip ation of these top 5 newcomers experience in the forum. Responde rs were any users of the site who attempted to answer the question or help the newcomer in any way within the same thread. Grounded Theory was used as a basis for data analysis, an approach that has been used in other OSS and online content analysis [14]. In the process of grounded theory development, theory generation and developm ent is done inductively by studying the phenomenon it represents. Concepts are discovered, developed, and provisionally verified through systematic data collection and analysis. One does not begin with a theory, and then prove it. Rather, one begins with an area of study and what is relevant to that area is allowed to emerge. Following this methodology we started with the general research questions as mentioned in the previous section, the sub-research questions were developed during the process of da ta collection and data analysis. Data Collection guided data analysis and data analysis guided subsequent data collection, which is a characteristic of grounded theory research. Each thread wa s individually read and coded on various dimensions for newcomer and responder behavior. All the threads were collected and coded ite ratively to deve lop some basic concepts, producing a list of categories for types of discussions, types of questions and types of responses. Once the first round of open coding was done and these base cat egories were obtained, a second round of coding was done to ensure that all the representative categories were acc ounted for. And also, to verify and count occurrences for each of the categories , the iterative process of interpretive coding was done. The best practices of successful newcomer were obtained by selective coding for these practices among the data that was already coded for newcomer behavior and responder behavior. Data was coded iteratively and weekly meeting among the two coders were part of the process. In these meetings, coders compared notes/memos and discussed and resolved any confusing categories/concepts. Multiple types of categories and concepts were disc overed during the process of this iterative coding and in this paper we focus specifically on newcomer behavior and socializa tion in online discussion forums for technical support. This section provides an overvie w of how newcomer behavior was categorized and analyzed. Newcomers were coded based on five dimensions, tone, prior knowledge, acknowledgement of help, comprehendible use of language and an initiative to learn. These five dimensions helped to determine whether a newcomer was a model, intermediate, or can improve newcomer (Table 2 explains further). For research question 1, model, intermediate, and can improve newcomers were categorized ba sed on coding the messages for five dimensions. The five dimens ions are explained below with examples and the multiple categories that were used for each category. Table 2 explains how the newcomers were categorized into model, intermediate (IM) and can improve (NI). For each thread, each behavior from each dimension was calculated on a rubric of five. If a newcomer used positive tones, exhibited prior knowledge on the subject, responded to the support and acknowledged help received, used clear and comprehendible language, and showed an initiative to learn and fix their problem, then they were assigned a five out of five. A specific breakdown is as follows: a best newcomer exhibits four to five of these characteristics in their particular thread; an intermediate newcomer exhibits three of these characteris tics in their particular thread; the worst newcomer exhibits zero to two of these characteristics in their particular thread. 1-Tone is the style of language a newcomer uses when they first post a message and how it is maintained throughout the thread. These were determined based on a positive, neutral, and negative scale. Newcomers that used more positive-oriented tones such as humble, friendly, and polite were considered to act as  X  X etter X  newcomers than one X  X  that poste d something in a desperate or annoyed manner. Neutral and st raightforward tones were also considered better than negative tones. A negative tone was labeled as desperate, annoyed, confused, or critical. Example of positive tone:  X  Howdy folks-This seems like a common newbie question but... X  Example of neutral tone:  X  X  close it &amp; then open firefox, but why does this happen? i run windows 7 X  Example of negative tone: Critical - X  Firefox is strictly for those who wish to cut their teeth on YOUR email programs and all other features. This browser has completely ruined my email program, causing me to have to move to IE and start all over again. X  2-Prior efforts and knowledge is how much experience a newcomer has with the specific issue they are facing. A newcomer displays prior knowledge through the use of jargon surrounding the software used, as well as steps already attempted to solve problem. Such display exhibits a familiarity with the software in question. Example of prior knowledge:  X  Eeverytime I hit the homepage icon a tab is added &lt;Search for web Help &gt; which leads to the help page of Google Web Search. Very a nnoying. This problem is not present when using IE. X  (Newcomer is exhibiting that they X  X e attempted same issue in IE without experiencing problem) 3-Responsiveness / Ac knowledgement of help was measured on whether or not the newcomer retu rned to the thread after posting the first message. Such an occurrence shows that the newcomer is committed to participating in thread interactions and is acknowledging the help they receive from responders on the forum. Example of acknowledgment of help :  X  X t works now. Thanks for helping a newbie in Igoogle. X  4-Comprehendible use of language was measured on the basis of grammatical and spelling usage. If there were a high number of spelling errors, abbreviated speak, or the conveyance of unclear thoughts, then the newcomer was counted as not using comprehendible language. Example of non-comprehendible language:  X  About bookmarks it's all ok but about Sessions? I done a lot of searches to find out something but without seccess. : ( X  5-Initiative to learn was displayed through the use of how the newcomer framed their question. If a newcomer seemed uninterested in actually learning how to solve the problem, but rather concerned with how someone else could solve the problem, was framed in the context of,  X  X  X  X e tried everything, please tell me the steps I can take to resolve this issue X  then the newcomer was exhibiting a high initiative to learn as they were interested in solving the problem themselves based on the potential advice given. Example of strong initiative to learn:  X  I ADORE FF, but can we have a more accurate warning me ssage in cases of non-EV certs, as you know as well as I do, that any lack of padlock could scare a newbie off joining my site and providing account signup info etc X . For research question 2, responde r behavior was also analyzed. The messages from res ponders were coded for three types of responses: encouraging, neutral and condescending. Once all the messages from respondent were coded by this rubric, the newcomers were divided into th ese three categories: newcomers who were encouraged, newcomers who were condescended to and newcomers who received neutra l responses. These newcomers were then followed for their participation after receiving a particular type of response. Al so, newcomers who did not receive responses were followed to see if they come back and participate in the forum. Coming back to the forum is important to ensure longevity of the newcomer which in turn is the backbone of any community. When members stay in communities it is then that communities are formed. For research question 3, we wanted to see if the newcomers who continued to contribute to the community exhibited any evidence of learning. For this we looked at the content of messages from newcomers and coded them for change in help seeking skills overtime. We also looked at the ro le that the newcomer is playing in the community, so if a newcomer is taking a help giving role than they are demonstrating that they have either learned something while being on the forum or have prior knowledge that they are willing to share with the community members. We understand a community member life-cycle. We wanted to see if all newcomers who choose to stay on the forum go through this transition or not, and those who do, what is unique about them. Based on these analyses, in the fourth research question we collect and highlight the best practices of a successful newcomer. A total of 129 threads were collected from four forums. In these 129 threads there were a total of 115 unique newcomers. Some newcomers were in more than one thread and therefore the number of newcomers is smaller th an the number of threads. The number of threads is not standard across forums because we collected threads in a specified time period and all the messages that were identified as newcomer messages were collected. For that reason, we will be using percen tages to talk about the results, so that we get a standard measure across the forums. Table 3 provided the number of threads collected and the number of newcomers identified from each forum. This section presents the findi ngs of newcomer behavior for model, intermediate, and can impr ove. Table 4 presents how the newcomers ranked in these three categories across the three forums. Our results show that the majority of newcomers fall into the model category and equal num bers of newcomers fall into intermediate and can improve categories. The characteristics of the majority (63%) of newcomers are:  X  Messages are positively framed  X  Demonstrate prior knowledge  X  Use comprehendible language  X  Show effort / initiative to learn  X  Responsiveness of newcomers One of the issues that are encountered multiple times in studying any online community participati on is the lack of response from the newcomers. That is why we looked at responsiveness of the newcomers by looking at three things . First, if they respond at all, second, if they do respond then how long do they take to respond? Finally when responding do they acknowledge help that they have received by being thankful or do they ignore the previous help and keep asking for more help. We found that overall 63% of the newcomers fall into the model category. Overall 18% of newcomers fall into intermediate category and 19% fall into can improve category. Intermediate 26 22 3 18 Can Improve 14 30 21 19 This section presents the findi ngs on the impact of responder behavior on newcomer X  X  continued participation and integration. Table 5 presents the findings on newcomers who only posted one time or those who did not return once they were condescended to. Table 6 compares the number of newcomers who did not return once they were not replied to with the newcomers who did not return once they were condescended to. Finally, we analyzed the future participation of newcomers who received encouraging responses, neutral responses, an d condescending responses. The key findings are first summarized and then details follow:  X  According to our dataset, almo st all non returning newcomers  X  A condescending response will lead an active member to  X  Not all newcomers who do not re ceive a response to their  X  Encouraging messages from re sponders are not any better For this question the responder me ssages were coded as following: No Response is when responders do not respond Encouraging responses were coded by any form of positive affirmation exhibited by the responder. Example of encouraging response:  X  X es just tried it myself. I had the same results. The import list was blank. So it's nothing you are doing wrong. X  Neutral responses were coded by using no positive or negative tone words, but rather a straightforward solution to the situation at hand. Example of neutral response:  X  X ou need to change the folder name to the name of an existing folder or remove the entire label section to make it apply to all folder and change the name of the icon to the one that you have created. X  Condescending responses were coded by use of sarcasm or patronizing language towards the newcomers. Such a response would presumably lead the newc omer to feel humbled or less likely to feel comfortable continue posting to the forum. Example of condescending response:  X   X  X t's not &lt;fill in product name here&gt;'s fault, we made it perfect. Our &lt;insert name product here&gt; is flawless... ish. X  In other words, always assume it's your PC's fault, because you are such a newbie if you think you can outsmart someone from &lt;fill in company here&gt; X  Impact of No Response: We first looked at newcomer behavior after nobody responds to them when they post their first question. We counted the newcomers who were not replied to in their first message and then looked at their continued participation on the forum. (Table 5) If the newcomer does not receive any reply from the community and does not come back to post in the community, we categorize that as did not retu rn after no reply. In our dataset we found that in Firefox and Koha , fifty percent of the newcomers who did not receive replies did not re turn to the forum. In Java, we saw that hundred percent of the newcomers who did not receive a reply did not come back showi ng a much higher negative impact on the newcomers in Java community. Firefox had very few (4) message s that were not responded to, showing that it is a very active community and also that it is very responsive to newcomers. Koha had fifty percent of newcomers return to the forums. Java had th e highest percentage of no reply messages and the highest percentage of non-returning newcomers. This indicates that the Java forums, because they are more technical in nature (programmer X  X  forums) are more difficult for newcomers to integrate in because community is not responsive to newcomer messages. These numbers give us an insight into how integration/longevity of newcomers is dependent on the environment of the forum. Some forums are more conducive to newcomers while some are not. The finding that the no reply messages lead to not returning newcomers is not new. Previous research (as mentioned in literature review section) has s hown that, receiving a reply is one of the critical factors to ensure newcomers return to a community. But, that cannot be the only factor responsible for non-returning newcomers and hence we also cal culated, out of the total non-returning newcomers (one time posters) how many did not return because of responder behavior. These percentages of  X  X id not return because of responder behavior X  in Table 6 is the total of newcomers who did not return after not being replied to and after being condescended to. In Firefox 26 percent of newcomers are one time posters and 16 percent of th em did not r eturn back due to responder behavior. In Java, 43 percent of newcomers were one time posters, but there were a la rger number of newcomers with multiple messages who did not come back because they received condescending messages from the responder. Impact of Condescending Responses: Then we looked at newcomers who received condescending responses and analyzed their future participation. Even if they were condescended to/ insulted by the community did they come back? What happens if they were not necessarily condes cended to in their first message, but at any time during their partic ipation? In our dataset overall 15% newcomers were condescended to and 10% of them did not return back after being condescended to. Now looking at numbers from each of the forums (Table 5), we can say that again the maximum percentage of newcomer s was condescended to in the Java forum  X  22 percent. Almost half of the newcomers who were condescended to did not return to Java forums, even if they had posted more than once in the forum. Similarly, in Firefox most of the newcomers who were condescended to did not return to the forum. Firefox has the highest number of non-returning newcomers due to condescending messages. This shows that the newcomers in Firefox are more prone to turn away if they do not receive a welcoming environment, possibly because of the less technical nature of the newcomers. Koha was the forum that had least number of condescending me ssages by responders and half of these lead to non-returning ne wcomers. This shows that Koha had most welcoming group of responders and were rarely condescending to the newcomers. Neutral and Encouraging Responses : Almost 75% of the messages that were posted by re sponders were coded neutral. Neutral messages provided gui dance/advice, tips to the newcomers. A few messages were coded encouraging. Encouraging messages have comments such as,  X  X ou have done nothing wrong, X   X  X ou are doing pretty good for a newbie, X   X  X ood job!, X  etc. These messa ges not only did provide the help that was needed but also provided encouragement to the newcomer to try things and post more messages. In our dataset, almost all th e non-returning newcomers can be attributed to either no respons e or condescending response from responders. Newcomers do not necessarily need encouraging messages to come back to the forum and participate, as neutral messages had the same impact on the newcomers continued participation. Not related to responders: Also important is the number of newcomers who only posted one message and then never came back, not necessarily because they were not replied to or were condescended to. The one time help seekers joined the forum and only posted one message (Table 6). In our dataset 31 percent of the total newcomers did not return back to the forums. Out of this 31% some were replied to and were given positive or neutral response by the community. In this study we do not have any information on this group of newcomers who do not come back. A larger percentage of these non-returning newcomers can actually be attributed to a discouraging response from the community. Either they were condescended to or were not replied to hence they stopped participating. Multiple studies in past have show n that one time posters are the largest number of people in any community. We are trying to understand why they don X  X  return, so that we can ensure their participation and integration. Fifty percent of newcomers post even after their first message was not replied to. Some of these in our dataset eventually fall in the model/intermediate user category showing that resilience or persistence is also another quality that works for newcomers when they enter a community. Evidence of learning from research question 3 was coded by seeking change in help seeking skills overtime. We also looked at the role that the newcomer is playing in the community; if a newcomer is taking a help giving role than they are demonstrating that they have either learned something while being on the forum or have prior knowledge that they are willing to share with the community members. We observed the following changes in the help seeking skills of the newcomers during their time on the forum:  X  The later messages from newcomers were more polite and  X  In the later messages, most of the newcomers start with a  X  The number of clarification que stions that they ask also  X  The approach to asking questions is not just to get a quick fix  X  Few of the newcomers, after posting for some time, starting We observed the following changes in the technical skills of newcomers after they have been actively participating on forum:  X  The language that the newcomers were using to define their  X  They mention they are using the latest versions of the  X  In Java, people commonly post some code in questions, but  X  The type of questions that th e newcomers ask also involve After this, we looked at all the messages from newcomers to see how many newcomers transitioned in to the role of help-giver. We understanding community member life-cycle. Similarly to research question 3, a brief timeline of newcomer X  X  role in each of their threads was created to see when they were help-seekers and when they acted as help-givers. We wanted to see if all newcomers who choose to stay on the forum go through this transition or not, and those who do , what is unique about them.

Transitioning to Help Givers (% of returning newcomers) Overall returning newcomers 69 
Overall newcomers transitioning to help givers In Table 7 we see that the percentage of newcomers who return back is highest in Koha, followed closely by Firefox, but the percentage of newcomers who also took the role of help giver is highest in Java. So, the newcom ers in Java show the highest percentage of learning in these criteria despite the previous findings Java being a comparatively tough forum for newcomers. This means that the newcomers who stay around in Java forums are more likely to contribute back to the forum what they have learned and demonstrate their learning. In our dataset overall 69% newcomers return and 30% newcomers become help givers. Showing that about one third of newcomers never come back (31%), abou t 30% newcomers become help givers, and leaving about 40% newc omers who stay help seekers. 4.5 Best Practices Demonstrated by Successful Newcomers To develop a complete understandi ng of successful newcomers we looked at two sets of newcomers: the first set were coded as model newcomers in the first research question and the second set were newcomers who always got their problem solved by the community. So we collected the messages from all these newcomers and analyzed them for some patterns that were obvious across all of them. Some of these patterns are repeated from the previous observations, as expected. For instance all the characteristics that we developed for the first question are part of theme creation, then some of the characteristics that were part of changes in newcomer behavior to wards learning were used and some additional common characteristics were identified when the message content was analyzed thoroughly. Informative Subject Line: The newcomers who used informative subject lines for their first message improved chances of getting responses as well as getting th eir problems solved by the community. The newcomers who were not using informative subjective lines were sometimes to ld by a community member that their subject line is not helpful! And some messages with vague subject lines like  X  X  am stuck,,help plz!!! X  did not receive any response from the community members. Tone: Successful newcomers were always positive, humble and grateful in their messages. Positive tone of a message from a newcomer ensured positive res ponses from responders usually. The newcomers who were friendl y and positive usually got good quality responses as compared to the newcomers whose first message was critical of the community or software and who received non friendly remarks from the community. Resilience/Persistence: As was shown in the results for research question two, the newcomers who were not discouraged by a first no reply or a condescending message eventually became successful contributing members of the community. Direct, to the point question : This was defined by whether or not a newcomer posed a message that asked a clear, direct question. The newcomers who posted direct to the point questions received very direct and useful help from the community. Prior efforts and knowledge: It was observed that when newcomers mentioned that they ha d already tried some options to fix their problem and have put efforts to look for a solution in the forums (usually search) then the responders were quick to respond and were very helpful. Seems like a message of legitimacy from the newcomer along the lines of  X  X  have done my homework, can I get some help now. X  Responsiveness This was calculated by looking at the time that the newcomer took to respond to the messages by responders and also if the newcomer responded at all to the messages from responders. Newcomers who engage d in a discussion with the responders by way of asking clarification questions or informing what they had done were more likely to stay longer in the community and contribute. Acknowledgement of help Acknowledgement was coded in terms of whether or not the ne wcomer stated  X  X hanks, X   X  X hank you X  or some variation therein. Also, if the newcomer responded to the advice with,  X  X  tried this X  or some similar variation, it was coded as an acknowledgement of help. This is similar to responsiveness by newcomers. Technical Language/ forum jargon: If the newcomers learn the technical jargon, acronyms of the community and use that to frame questions they get quicker replies. Also, if they form rapport with individuals from community and request for help by name, they get their problems solved.
 Comprehendible use of language: This is just a basic requirement for receiving respons es, if the newcomer does not post comprehendible messages or us es a language that the forum responders do not understand than their messages are removed from the forum by the moderators. Initiative to learn : This is demonstrated by newcomers by engaging in a discussion with the community members, by asking conceptual  X  X ow X  questions, and by showing willingness to learning order to apply this knowledge from the forums. Help givers seem to engage more w ith future posts from newcomers whom they have helped previously and who have engaged in a rich conversation. Provides help to other members: Most of the newcomers that we studied as transitioning into help givers had most of the characteristics of model newcomers, showing that successful newcomers learn and share their own knowledge with the community. A successful newcomer contributes to the community by becoming an active member as help seeker as well as help giver whenever possible. From the analysis of this data, there were some interesting points raised from newcomer and responder behavior in online communities. Some of our results are in line with previous findings about newcomer integration into online communities, such as community responsiveness in form of a reply is associated with increases in the newcomer X  X  future participation [8], responsiveness to the community [10], and longevity in the group [9]. Replies signal that the group believes the newcomer is a potentially valuable prospective member worth its attention, motivating the newcomer to reciprocate by writing more and replying to others. These conversa tions help transform newcomers into committed contributors. On the other hand, posters interpret silence as rudeness or unfriendliness which leads to not returning to the forums [3]. Some of our results are completely opposite to previous results. For instance, as opposed to Joyce and Kraut (2006) we found little evidence that the nature of the reply influenced newcomers X  commitment to the group. In thei r study the likelihood of posting again was not associated with the length of the reply, whether it was filled with words indicating agreement or negation or with words indicating positive or negative emotions. In our study we found that no reply as well condescending reply meant that the newcomer will not come back to the forum and is hence adversely impacted by the tone of the message from responder. In our dataset, we could attribute almo st all non-returning newcomers to either a condescending reply or no reply from the community. We also saw that the majority of newcomers exhibit  X  X odel X  newcomer characteristics. In addition, we saw that newcomers are not a homogenous group of users and their behavior is varied and hence their experience in online communities is varied. We also looked at in-depth evidence of learning in these communities, because ultimately that is what we wanted to identify and measure. We were able to find and highlight evidence of learning the software as well as forum norms by looking at the patterns in the messages posted by newcomers over a period of time. We saw that the messages became more polite, grateful, and technical and to the point direct questions, as the newcomers stayed in the community and participated. So we observed a positive effect on the leaning of newcomers in these communities. And finally, based on all the analysis we were able to develop a set of characteristics of successful newcomers that can be used as a best practices guide for newcomers in such communities. A key limitation of this research is that it is based on secondary data and not self reported data. As a follow-up to this study we would like to conduct triangulati on interviews for the findings from secondary data. We would also like to identify and present self reported evidence of learning in these communities. In future work, we have started looking at how the behavior of newcomers X  impacts the quality of responses that they receive from the community and how can they ensure good quality responses.
