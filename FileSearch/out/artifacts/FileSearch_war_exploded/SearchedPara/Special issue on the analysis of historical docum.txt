 EDITORIAL Apostolos Antonacopoulos  X  Andy C. Downton 1 Overview There is an increasing need to digitally preserve and provide access to historical document collections residing (and possi-bly decaying) in libraries, museums and archives. Documents range from ancient manuscripts, through early printed books, to typewritten administrative documents of the twentieth cen-tury. A common thread is that the documents are typically valued for their physical appearance as much as their con-tent. The documents to be analysed can be originals (paper, parchment, etc.) or in image form (already scanned, possibly using now outdated technology). The key requirement is to be able to process these unique manuscripts, whether they are presented as free flowing text (e.g., treatises and novels) or structured at different levels of physical-logical structure correspondence (e.g., letters, census lists, trade forms). Deg-radation may be caused by a lifetime of use and physical dete-rioration. In addition to the original content, access must also be preserved to user annotations and corrections, stamps and unique artwork. Each class of document requires a different approach throughout the conversion process and lends itself to different levels of information extraction and description.
As the application of existing technology to the analysis of historical documents exposes a myriad of weaknesses, novel and more robust methods are being developed to cope with this challenging problem. The issues involved in the analysis of historical documents are highly topical, as is evident from the rapidly growing number of related publications appearing in the literature. 2 Challenges and opportunities Several research topics predominate in the analysis of his-torical documents. First, the digitisation (scanning or cap-ture using other camera-based devices) of such documents must deal with requirements for detail preservation (includ-ing degradation artefacts, in some cases) of both foreground and background information. The choice and availability of image acquisition equipment directly affects the digitisation parameters and the overall image quality. In many applica-tions the safe handling of fragile documents is the primary concern while in others (e.g., index card scanning) a high throughput is possible X  X nd often required.

Second, one of the most significant obstacles to further analysis is the presence of a multitude of different types of artefacts mostly due to degradations of both the substrate (prominent texture, damage etc.) and the ink-based content (e.g., ink seepage, show-through etc.). The digital enhance-ment of the captured documents is a research topic that has attracted considerable attention but at the same time remains a significant open problem.

A third broad category of challenges relates to the anal-ysis of the layout and that of individual types of regions of interest. The extraction of subsequently added entities such as annotations and stamps as well as the detection of dec-orative regions (e.g., ornamental letters) are examples. The analysis of colour (if present) is particularly important for both the differentiation of such entities from the main textual content and their accurate preservation.

The recognition of the content of different entities on the document is a fourth major area of research and a particu-larly challenging one for historical documents. Recognition objectives can vary from obtaining some form of encoding (useful for database retrieval at least) to full extraction of con-cepts based on linguistic analysis of text and domain-specific knowledge. Naturally, the level of recognition that is actually possible is determined (in decreasing order) by whether the document is printed, typewritten or handwritten. In the latter case, the particular writing style and consistency (resulting from a single or multiple writers, for instance) largely deter-mine the level of success achieved. The recognition of graph-ical components (illustrations or embellishments) in terms of their decomposition into primitives is also of interest at this stage.

A fifth very important consideration for historical docu-ments is related to their use once they are digitised. Depend-ing on the type of document and the level of information that has been possible to extract from it, there are various possibilities for its representation and retrieval mechanisms. On the one hand, on documents where recognition has been possible, there are several additional issues regarding post-processing and the construction of ontologies for retrieval using higher level semantics. On the other hand, for most older manuscripts keyword-based retrieval can be effected by matching word shapes (without recognition). In its most general form this technique, referred to as word spotting, is based on the comparison of shape-related features between the image of the query keyword (extracted from the document itself) and the individual images of the remaining words in the document.

Last but certainly not least there are several systems-related issues that manifest themselves in any large-scale con-version effort. In addition to performance considerations of volume-processing (common perhaps with other DIA sys-tems), the unique nature of historical documents and their analysis necessitates a significant involvement of non-technical experts (e.g., archivists, curators and historians). It is very often necessary to capture knowledge and semantic information from such experts as well as provide them with user-friendly means of specifying, interacting with, monitor-ing and validating the analysis process and its results. 3 Contents of the special issue This special issue aims to draw together papers describing research and experience in a wide range of topics of interest related to the analysis of historical documents. The papers are organised into three broad parts. The first part contains papers dealing with specific analysis methods focused on different problems. Starting with the oldest documents, in the first paper  X  X igital image analysis to enhance underwritten text in the Archimedes palimpsest X , Salerno and colleagues describe a focused but challenging (and intriguing) problem. They describe their study of multi-spectral image analysis methods to recover written (and subsequently erased and overwritten) information from a single but uniquely precious document.

In  X  X inarization, character extraction, and writer identi-fication of historical Hebrew calligraphy documents X , Bar-Yosef and colleagues describe techniques they developed to analyse calligraphic Hebrew documents dating from the four-teenth to sixteenth centuries. Specific characters are extracted using morphological operators from suitably binarised images and several geometric features are selected and exam-ined in order to effectively solve the writer identification problem.  X  X ermite and Gabor transforms for noise reduction and handwriting classification in ancient manuscripts X  by Eglin and co-authors describes biologically-inspired tech-niques for degraded document enhancement and writer iden-tification and their application on eighteenth to nineteenth century writers X  notes and manuscripts.

The paper by Likforman-Sulem and colleagues, entitled  X  X ext line segmentation of historical documents: a survey X  concludes the first part of this Special Issue. As the title sug-gests, the authors comprehensively categorise and describe different approaches to the important intermediate analysis step of identifying individual textlines in (mostly handwrit-ten) historical documents.

The second part of this Special Issue is devoted to vari-ous approaches for word spotting and recognition . Rath and Manmatha, the first to introduce word spotting to (handwrit-ten) historical document indexing and retrieval, describe the rationale and characteristics of the idea in  X  X ord spotting in historical documents X . Based on the premise that documents are essentially collections of word images, they describe word-profile based image features to represent words and examine the problem of word image matching based on those features. Notably, the use of dynamic time warping is dis-cussed and compared with other algorithms. Finally, several algorithms are applied to the problem of word image clus-tering and their results discussed.

In  X  X ord matching using single closed contours for index-ing handwritten historical documents X , Adamek and col-leagues propose an alternative to using word-profile based features for word spotting. In their effort to avoid the strong dependency of matching methods to word image normal-isation and baseline detection, they extract word contours instead and construct a multi-scale convexity-concavity rep-resentation for each word image. Elastic matching of con-tours is achieved by a comparison approach based on dynamic time warping.  X  X eyword-guided word spotting in historical printed doc-uments using synthetic data and user feedback X  by Konidaris and co-authors presents a word spotting method for degraded printed documents. Instead of extracting whole word images from the documents to form queries, this approach accepts encoded (ASCII) user input and synthesizes the query word image using a character set extracted from the document collection to be searched. Word matching is performed by evaluating a distance measure calculated on a set of hybrid spatial/density features. The matching process is progres-sively refined by taking into account user feedback on the relevance of the retrieval results.

Ntzios and colleagues describe a spotting-like approach to handwriting recognition in  X  X n old Greek handwritten OCR system based on an efficient segmentation-free approach X . This approach is useful for handwritten documents written in a consistent style, even in the presence of highly con-nected (difficult to segment) characters. After enhancement and skeletonisation of the text, patterns (corresponding to parts of characters and ligatures) containing open and closed cavities are identified. These cavities are analysed and using suitable features, the corresponding characters are recogni-sed.

Finally, the third part of this Special Issue contains papers that present complete systems or discuss systems-related aspects of historical document analysis. In  X  X EBORA: Dig-ital AccEss to BOoks of the RenAissance X , Le Bourgeois and Emptoz give a comprehensive account of experiences and results gained in constructing a conversion document analysis system for rare sixteenth century books, as part of a European-wide project.

Co X asnon and colleagues present a methodology for doc-ument structure description and its application in a large scale conversion system for handwritten administrative doc-uments of the nineteenth century in  X  X ccess by content to handwritten archive documents: generic document recogni-tion method and platform for annotations X .

In  X  X ser-driven page layout analysis of historical printed books X , Ramel and co-authors describe an interactive approach to layout analysis of books for the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries. They examine different layout anal-ysis methods and propose a hybrid method that, used as part of a suitable user-specified processing sequence, is more robust to the characteristics and artefacts of such documents.
A complete conversion system for (mostly typewritten) index cards is described by Downton and colleagues in  X  X ser-configurable OCR enhancement for online natural history archives X . Large collections of index cards from the UK Natural History Museum represent, in a structured way, a comprehensive inventory of organisms X  scientific names and associated bibliographic information. The authors discuss and demonstrate how an off-the-shelf OCR system (which would fail if applied outright) can be effectively used for such documents provided that suitable pre-processing and post-processing modules are integrated and guided by non-technical users.

Finally, in  X  X sing colour information to understand cen-sorship cards of film archives X , Altamura and co-authors present a knowledge-based system approach to the semi-automatic extraction of information from historical film cen-sorship cards. The role of colour information is explored and used in each document image analysis and understand-ing step and results are demonstrated in the context of the European-wide project COLLATE.

The thirteen papers in this special issue of IJDAR pres-ent a unique opportunity to review current research activity in analysis and recognition of historical archive documents, a field that has received growing attention and interest over the last 5 years. We would like to thank the authors for their patience in collaborating with us to assemble this valuable resource, and congratulate them on their contributions. We hope this IJDAR special issue on the Analysis of Historical Documents will stimulate further research in archive docu-ment recognition for many years to come.
