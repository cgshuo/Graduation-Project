The 30th International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER-2011) highlighted the strong and persistent interest in research on conceptual modeling for developing information systems. Topics included data modeling theory, goal modeling, socio-technical factors, requirements engineering, process modeling, and ontologies.

From the 25 regular papers of ER-2011, we invited the authors of the seven best papers to submit a substantially enhanced version for this special issue. The authors of six papers prepared submissions, which then underwent a thorough peer review consisting of two rounds of review. Five papers were finally accepted. The first paper by Thalheim and Wang investigates the theory behind data migration using an entity  X  relationship framework. The authors discovered that two types of data transformations are sufficient, one is property-preserving and the other is property-enhancing. The theoretic results are the basis for sound migration tools. The authors also provide an extension to the generic proof method by Schellhorn to verify properties of transformations. The second paper by Ingolfo, Siena, Mylopoulos, Susi, and Perini focuses on compliance of software requirements with regulations. The novelty of this paper is that it addresses compliance at the initial phase of requirements collection, rather than validating that a software specification is compliant with regulations. The stakeholders are guided to revisions of their requirements via a discussion model, linking the discussion layer with the solution space. The third paper by Ferrarotti, Hartmann, and Link considers cardinality constraints for XML data. While cardinality constraints have been intensively studied for conceptual data models, and also for XML, there is a particular need to balance the expressiveness of cardinality constraints against the tractability of their evaluation. The authors investigate the complexity and provide a polynomial-time algorithm for a class of cardinality constraints. In the fourth paper, Berger, Sturm and Wand evaluate to what extent an ontology-based approach can support novice software developers as they produce adaptions of software systems. The work is based on Bunge's ontology of software systems (defining states, events, etc.) and uses function points to measure the complexity of the software system. The last paper of this special issue is by Paja, Chopra, and Giorgini. It generalizes the notion of trust from agents to socio-technical systems, which are according to the authors essentially defined via trust, not only towards other agents but also towards the system as a whole. A logic-based language to specify trust relations is provided and applied to a case study.

We thank the authors for providing extended versions of their conference papers to this special issue and for implementing the revisions that the reviewers requested. We gratefully acknowledge the work of the reviewers who provided detailed and constructive feedback to the authors, and who worked under a tight schedule. T hese reviewers include Yu Ge, Michael Grossniklaus, Arantza Illarramendi, Matthias Jarke, Stanislaw Jarzab ek, Paul Johannesson, Julio Leite, Stephen Lid dle, Michele Missikoff, Emerson Murphy-Hill, Andreas L Opdahl, Sylvia Osborn, Jos X  Palazzo M. De Oliveira, Oscar Pastor Lopez, Anne Persson, Christoph Quix, James Terwilliger, and Xiaofang Zhou. We also cordially thank Peter Chen, the editor-in-chief of DKE, for encouraging us to organize this special issue. We are very pleased to present these papers on conceptual modeling to the scientific community.
