 Online news reading has become the major method to know about the world as web provide more information than other media like TV and radio. However, traditional online news reading interface is inconvenient for many types of people, especially for those who are disabled or taking a bus. This paper presents a mobile application iNewsBox 1 enabling users to listen to news collected from the Internet. In order to simplify necessary interactions of getting valuable news, we also propose a framework for using implicit feedback to recommend news in this paper. Experiment shows our algo-rithms in iNewsBox are effective.

With the increasing number of media that provide their contents through the Internet, more Americans have being getting their news from the Web than from newspapers since https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inewsbox/id575886672 2011 [2]. How to help the users get the news they are inter-ested in has been a hot issue for both researchers and engi-neers. However, traditional online news reading applications and websites provide inconvenient approaches to their users for reading news. This kind of interface is not applicable for those who cannot pay attention on the screen. Listening to news radio may be the most convenient way to access news for most people. Unlike web news reading, traditional news radio application provides no choices for users. Users may be forced to listen to useless articles to know what the next one is. On the other hand, offering users more options, like the mode of reading web news, by providing a news list makes it too complicated to use.

To handle the drawbacks of traditional radio applications, we present a personalized news radio application iNewsBox . A framework for recommending news by employing implicit feedback is also proposed in the paper. We learn interests and needs of users from their implicit feedback in iNewsBox and play the synthetic sound of news selected by our news recommendation system to users individually.

In order to collect news in real time, we build a RSS mon-itor continually crawling RSS channels from various news websites like CNN , ABC and USA Today . Once the moni-tor found a new item in a RSS file, the text displayed on the page of corresponding URL are stored into our database. Images of articles are also downloaded for providing users more specific impressions of the articles. After the article is downloaded, we generate a MP3 file from the text by using some TTS middleware. Over 300 articles are downloaded per day into our server for waiting to be recommended to iNewsBox users.

Since users are not willing to listen to similar articles continuously, incremental news clustering is implemented to cluster articles into several events and articles of the same event would not be played to a user sequentially. Then we employ LDA to generate a topic distribution for each event. A similarity-based filtering algorithm is achieved as the news recommender. Both content and collaborative in-formation are considered to generate recommendation in our system since it faces new items more frequently and tradi-tional collaborative-filtering algorithm is not as effective as in other circumstance.
 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe previous work about synthetic news radio, news recommendation and other related work while Section 3 introduce the way we cluster news. The detail of the news recommender is showed in Section 4. After an introduction of iNewsBox user interface in Section 5, our experiment is demonstrated in Section 6. As the last part of this paper, our discussion is given in Section 7.
Recently, various clustering algorithms, topic models and recommender algorithms are used to personalize news read-ing. Abhinandan S. Das et al. propose to utilize MinHash clustering, PLSI and covisitation counts to build their news recommender in Google News [3]. Jiahui Liu et al. present their personalized news recommender system based on click behavior [4]. Other attempts to advance the personalization of news reading stay at improving screen reading but not radio styled reading like iNewsBox .
In this part, we describe the methods we use for news clus-tering. As discussed before, news has to be clustered into events to avoid recommending similar news on same event. As a matter of fact, news focusing on one same event will have little differences even they are from various source. So we transform the original form of news to a bag-of-words rep-resentation to extract the intrinsic key words of it. This is in-troduced in TF-IDF classifier method. Since news comes in a stream way, clustering algorithm such as K-means will not fit this scenario. We adopt a two-stage clustering method to cluster news into events. A similar method is first intro-duced in [5].
After the collected articles are clustered into events, the problem of recommending news turns into recommending events for users. Once our recommender decided to recom-mend an event, the latest article of the event would be played to the user. No more than one article of the same event will be broadcasted to unless the event has been updated. In the remainder of this section, we will focus on how we employ implicit feedback to recommend event.
In order to learn user preferences about news, following 4 types of feedback are collected to model our recommender:
LDA is a powerful topic model learning topics from some documents.[1] We perform LDA on all events in our database to get the relevance of every event to generated topics. Both the results of LDA and the numbers of co-responses are employed to measure the similarities between each pair of events.

The main reason we employ two different approaches to deal with news clustering and event similarity measurement is that TF-IDF is sensitive for event word feature like specific persons and countries while LDA is more likely to find out the topic similarity rather than event similarity.
For the later-collected events, we estimate their vectors by employing TF-IDF similarities between them and the events that have been processed by LDA.

In order to model users X  behaviors, we use four 0-1 vectors to represent 4 responses given in Section 4.1 as follow: Based on the assumption that similar items get similar re-sponses for specific user. A prediction of user u  X  X  response to item i is defined as follow: sponse given by user u to item j , D is the items set contain-ing all items that have been recommended to user u before and Sim ( d i ,d j ) is the similarity between item i and j de-fined as above.

In the last of this part, a scoring function considering the user X  X  implicit feedback as well as items X  content is given as follow: while  X , X   X  0 are coefficients determined by experiments demonstrating the relative effective of Like and Dislike re-sponses.

However, our recommender dosen X  X  always broadcast the news with highest score but also recommend the latest one by a small probability to enhance recommendation recall. It is similar to -greedy algorithm in reinforcement learning. We take = 0 . 1 in iNewsBox . iNewsBox is available on iOS devices now. Users can download and install iNewsBox of latest version by search-ing iNewsBox in the App Store. Figure 1 shows two screen captures of iNewsBox while the user is listening to our news radio. From the left screen capture of Figure 2, we can find that there are two channels, named Private Radio and Real-time News, that can be chosen on the top. Users can listen to the personalized news radio in Private Radio while in Realtime News , users are always getting the latest news. A picture of the current news is showed below so that users can pause or play by touching the picture. The present time of current track and its title are displayed too. On the bottom of this screen capture, 3 main buttons are given, enabling users to label current news as Like, label current news as Dislike and skip respectively. iNewsBox can also run in the background of iOS device. During the usage of iNewsBox , the device should be locked in most cases. We employ lock screen to make it convenient for users to give their feedback in those circumstances. The right screen capture of Figure 1 shows the lock screen while iNewsBox is working. We can see the title and the picture of the current playing news, followed by Last , Play/Pause and Next buttons. Users can also use the remotes on their headset wires to control iNewsBox .
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we ask 20 volunteers to try the two channels of iNewsBox for 20 minutes. The reason we fix the listening time is in order to eliminate the effects of volunteers X  inpatience and get more data from such a small number of volunteers. These 20 peo-ple are divided into 2 groups without being notified. Vol-unteers in the first group of 10 get the latest news without any personalization ( i.e., Realtime News channel, RN) in the first 10 minutes, then listen to the personalized radio using our proposed recommender ( i.e., Private Radio channel, PR ) in the last 10 minutes. 10 volunteers in the second group firstly listen to Private Radio for 10 minutes, and then listen to Realtime News for another 10 minutes. No volunteers are informed about the purpose of the experiment.

As shown in Table 1, our proposed recommender lengthen the average listening time per article (#avg. listening sec-onds) and successfully reduce the the number of touches during the listening time. Even though many of volunteers indicate that they have felt no obvious differences between our two channels during those 20-minute-long tryouts, our algorithm did help them avoid many operations. We be-lieve people who are disabled or having other troubles with standard interface would benefit from the features of our iNewsBox .
In this paper, we propose a mobile application that al-lows users to listen to personalized news radio synthesized by TTS. Our system is effective and extensible. A story can be broadcasted to users by our system within 2 minutes after the media published the story through RSS. The recommen-dations of iNewsBox are effective in our tests. In our future work, we will design recommender algorithms for this novel scenario and do experiments to compare those algorithms in our iNewsBox with massive datasets.
