 The Exploration, Navigation and Retrieval of Information in Cultural Heritage Workshop (ENRICH 2013) offers a forum to 1) discuss the challenges and opportun ities in Information Retrieval research in the area of Cultural Heritage; 2) encourage collaboration between researchers engaged in work in this specialist area of Information Retrieval, and to foster the formation of a research community; and 3) identify a set of actions which the community should undertake to progress the research agenda. The workshop will foster a new stream of Information Retrieval research and support the design of search tools that can help end-users fully exploit the wonderful Cultural Heritage material that is available across the globe. H.3.3 [Information Storage and Re trieval]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  Search Process Cultural Heritage, Digital Humanities, Information Retrieval A key challenge facing the curators and providers of digital cultural heritage worldwide is to instigate, increase and enhance engagement with their collections. To achieve this, a fundamental change in the way these artefacts can be discovered, explored and contributed to by users and co mmunities is required. Cultural heritage artefacts are digital repr esentations of pr imary resources: manuscript collections, painti ngs, books, photographs etc. The text-based resources are often innately  X  X oisy X , contain non-standard spelling, poor punctua tion and obsolete grammar and word forms. Image-based resources often have limited associated metadata which describes the re sources and their content. In addition, the information needs and tasks of cultural heritage users are often complex and diverse, evolving through information exploration and discove ry. This presents a specific set of challenges to traditional Info rmation Retrieval (IR) techniques and approaches. This workshop investigates th e enhanced retrieval of, and interaction with, cultural heritage collections. We are interested in investigating innovative forms of personalised, multi-lingual IR, which can include:  X  Content-aware retrieval which responds to the entities and  X  Personalised IR, exploration a nd presentation which responds  X  Community-aware retrieval which responds to wider Such new forms of enhanced IR require rigorous evaluation and validation using appropriate metric s, contrasting digital cultural heritage collections and divers e users and communities. This workshop promotes such evaluation, taking into account the specific requirements of the domai n. The workshop also explores the use of multilingual, multimodal and personalised IR techniques and technologies to enable end-users to search in their native language, but receive results collated from content consumption. The nature of cultura l heritage resources means that content analysis in support of IR is of specific interest. This includes the automated normalisation of historical texts, the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for entity extraction and metadata generation. The ENRICH workshop promotes th e exchange of ideas between researchers working on the theory and foundations of IR, cross and multi-lingual IR, personalised search and recommender systems. There are numerous resear ch areas that can support such improved retrieval and exploration in the area of cultural heritage. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to: Multilingual semantic search; Context-aware and semantic recommender systems; Adaptation engines a nd algorithms for personalised multilingual IR; User modelling and adaptation; Content personalisation and personalised result presentation; Domain modelling; External knowledge resources for IR; Evaluation methodologies and metrics for personalised multilingual IR; Information Extraction, Data Mining and Natural Language
