XML has become the new standard for the representation and exchange of both structured and semistruc-tured data. Therefore, managing XML schema and data management has become a central topic of research recently. The purpose of the 3rd XML Schema and Data Management Workshop was to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and experiences among the theoreticians and practitioners who are involved in design, management, and implementation of XML data management systems. The workshop was held in April, 2006 in conjunction with the 22nd IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2006). The work-shop included 10 regular papers with many interesting discussions sparked off during the workshop among the presenters and the audience.

This special issue of Data and Knowledge Engineering features five papers selected from the XSDM 2006 submitted papers based on their merits and relevance. Each of these papers is an extended and revised version of the original workshop paper and has gone through a rigorous reviewing process before being accepted for inclusion in this special issue.

The first paper entitled  X  X  X USAX: Context-Specific Searching in XML Documents Using Sequence Align-ment Techniques X  X  proposes a new context searching technique for XML using sequence alignment algorithms. The author has designed a system called, SUSAX which allows contextual querying XML data using XPath. The matching algorithm is based on Sequence Alignment Techniques. The performance comparison shows that the proposed technique is better than Google desktop searching. The second paper is to improve process-ing time of XPath queries by defining a rule set to simplify XPath queries. It achieves very high speed-up fac-tors if it detects an unsatisfiable XPath query by simplifying the XPath query to the empty expression and thus avoids its evaluation. It proves that a given XPath query is unsatisfiable by mapping it to the empty expres-sions. The next paper is on temporal XML schema versioning, it proposes placing temporal annotations describing which portion and how the document changes over time. The physical schema may be time varying documents. It discusses a validator to validate documents which changes over time, while its schema and even its representation are also changing over time. The fourth paper is  X  X  X rocessing Recursive XQuery over XML Streams: The Raindrop Approach X  X . In this paper, authors present stream algebra operators for efficient exe-cution of recursive Xquery stream processing by keeping the memory usage low. It discusses just-in-time struc-tural join strategies to optimize the memory and CPU usage. The last paper in this special issue is on XML schema integration which generates a global schema from multiple local schemas, whereas global queries are partitioned back into local queries. The local results are integrated to produce a result to a global query.
The papers in this special issue exemplify a number of new and exciting research areas in the field of XML schema and data management.

We wish to thank Professor Reind P. van de Riet, Editor-in-Chief in Europe of the journal, for giving us the opportunity to be the issue editors of this special issue. We also wish to express our appreciation to the authors who submitted their papers to be considered for the special issue and also revised them in the given time.
Last, but not least, we would like to gratefully acknowledge all the reviewers who worked within a very tight schedule and gave detailed and constructive feedback to the authors.
