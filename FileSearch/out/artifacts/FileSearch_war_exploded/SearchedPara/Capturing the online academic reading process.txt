 1. Introduction
The interaction process between humans and published writings started a long time ago, and people have been making notes or providing written comments about the material that they have been reading ever since.
These comments were then circulated and shared among colleagues on annotated paper documents, and were believed to have played an important part in the dissemination of knowledge ( Tribble, 1997 ). With advances in computing technology, paper-based print is giving way to digital media as more print documents now appear in an electronic format, as in digital libraries. This growth is set to bring about significant changes in the read-ing practices. One anticipated change is that similar to paper documents, an increasing number of digital doc-uments are likely to be shared among community members, who will read and possibly mark them. Therefore, a rise in information sharing via electronic (e-) writings (in the form of markings) should be anticipated as active reading 2 and document sharing becomes a convenient activity. In order to better appreciate the impact of this change, an understanding of the reading and marking process of digital library (DL) users is needed to facilitate and exploit this new medium of information exchange.

This baseline study was undertaken to address the above situation described. The purpose was to under-stand the structure of user markings by investigating the interaction between participating readers and elec-tronic reading applications. In particular, patterns and characteristics of the markings made on electronic documents by participating readers were examined, and their navigational activities were catalogued while they were reading and marking e-documents. A common form of document markings is annotations. Anno-tations may consist of short textual expressions, such as  X  X  X es X  X ,  X  X  X o X  X ,  X  X  X rue X  X ,  X  X  X greed X  X , etc., or may be com-posed of notes providing an explanation of some sort, such as a reference, description, viewpoint, or critique ( O X  X ara, Smith, Newman, &amp; Sellen, 1998 ). Markings on paper documents can also be symbolic writings, such bols and indicators, such as colours, circles, asterisks, brackets, and place lines.

The investigation took place in two virtual reading environments, that is, individual versus an asynchronous document sharing setting. It is hoped that the findings will guide the design of new reading applications in digital libraries and will result in products that are more sensitive to the reading and marking needs of the DL users.
Different work environments may require different kinds of reading practices, which makes it difficult to design a universal electronic reader application to support all readers in diverse reading settings. In view of such constraints, the present study limits its focus to academic readers who read research articles to gain knowledge. The focus was on digital document reading within real work settings. Therefore, a sample of stu-dents from one academic course was deliberately chosen to explore the range and diversity of academic read-ing activities, and to uncover any commonalities that might nonetheless emerge. The onscreen reading activities of this set of users were automatically recorded during the interaction itoring was complemented by interviews to fully understand the reading and marking actions. As a result of these investigations, the study puts together a rich database of descriptive and quantitative measures. The find-ings include documenting a description and classification of the range of reading and marking activities, a dis-cussion of the common findings across the sample, and what these findings mean in terms of application design requirements to create a better reading experience for users of electronic (e-) documents in a digital library. 2. Review of the related works
Markings made by readers of paper documents either served a future use for the current owner of the doc-ument, or resulted in better comprehension for subsequent readers if the document was shared. The digital library (DL) environments facilitate this process by ensuring convenient access to each e-document by multiple readers. Therefore, read and marked e-documents in a DL can now be easily shared among members of a group, or within communities. Moreover, while an annotation made on paper documents is essentially a pri-vate remark, the same annotation in a communal digital setting has the potential of carrying the knowledge and information contained within it to the next reader ( Marshall, 1998 ). The knowledge transfer is easier since it is no longer impractical or  X  X ad manners X  to mark e-document residing in a DL. Rather, the annotations now act as important adjuncts to the primary text ( Marshall, 1997 ). The markings make a statement about the document, or some part of it at a certain point in time as they are the outcome of attentive reading of a text ( Hanna, 1991 ), and are a visible trace of human attention ( Marshall, 1997 ).

Research that has been conducted on text markings in electronic documents (e-documents) and the user interfaces is minimal when compared to the research that has been conducted on paper documents markings.
The substantial number of studies focusing on markings made on paper documents can be categorized into the following groups: (1) Investigations by literary and historical scholars, who study annotations made by famous people and (2) Research by scholars in the field of educational psychology who focus mostly on the read-to-learn sit-(3) Studies on markings made during collaborative authoring settings, which focus on comments or notes (4) Research specifically focusing on the types, characteristics and uses of text markings, which is then used
Due to the diversification of objectives within these research projects, it is very difficult to compare the stud-ies across the groupings that have been defined above, beyond simple categorization. Simple related factors do however appear. For example, there are only a few existing studies ( Cadiz, Gupta, &amp; Grudin, 2000; Churchill, Trevor, Bly, Nelson, &amp; Cubranic, 2000; Marshall &amp; Brush, 2002, 2004; Marshall, Price, Golovchinsky, &amp;
Schilit, 2001 ) that attempt to characterize or analyze markings made on e-documents. However, the user-perceived functions of e-document markings are given little attention in these studies, and user interface con-cerns for facilitating the marking practices in shared electronic documents are generally ignored. Similarly, while electronic reading process has been investigated by several researchers ( Adler et al., 1998; Dillon, 1992; Hornb X k &amp; Fr X kj X r, 2003; O X  X ara &amp; Sellen, 1997 ), focus on studying the complete user-document interaction is missing. Therefore, a study of the active reading process in electronic environments is necessary to better inform the reading interface design in a digital library.

The over-riding assumption in previous studies and system development efforts has been that when inter-acting with e-applications, users will behave in the same manner as they do when interacting with paper doc-uments. Such an assumption is not necessarily correct and perhaps it is one of the reasons why so few users are actively using electronic marking applications. Consequently, while there has been a tremendous effort from the point of view of systems development, little empirical testing has been carried out on the forms and func-tionality of the markings made on electronic documents ( Cadiz et al., 2000; Wolfe &amp; Neuwirth, 2001 ). We intend to fill this knowledge gap by performing a study of how users actively read electronic documents in a digital environment. 3. The approach
The purpose of this study was to explore the interaction between participating readers and digital reading applications, which facilitate marking actions, to understand the structure and functionality of markings made by users of e-documents. The data were recorded when the participants were interacting with e-documents in an individual or document sharing environment. The details of the activities were unpacked later through in-depth interviews. While such a methodology cannot claim to generate as representative a sample of data as larger scale studies, it can provide important input for inspiring and shaping new design ideas to facilitate readers using e-documents in a digital library.

The methodology and data analysis were guided by the following two research questions: (1) What major forms and noteworthy usages 4 of markings are recorded by electronic document readers to (2) What are the functions performed by the participants X  marking forms, and their usage of markings in an
No hypotheses are stated at this time as this is an exploratory and baseline study to investigate user-cen-tered design issues. Therefore, the qualitative analyses of data gathered through user interviews and video observations provides the main findings of the study. The quantitative results present simply an overview of some interesting results that future researchers may wish to explore further. 3.1. Study environment
Students enrolled in a graduate course were chosen as the target population for this exploratory study. The course title was  X  X  X anagement of Information Organizations X  X  and it was a required course in Information
Studies. Graduate students were chosen as they are required to read research articles as part of their course work. The task was that the student read researcher-assigned electronic articles from the reading list of their course. Effort was made to ensure that the chosen article was highly relevant to the topic to be discussed in class the following week, was not too technical, and was not lengthy. The motivation to read for the students was that they gain sufficient knowledge from each reading to lead a potential discussion on the subject in class.
This task was chosen because readers annotate more if they are expected to actively participate in a group discussion, rather than simply sit in one ( Marshall, Price, Golovchinsky, &amp; Schilit, 1999; Wolfe, 2001 ). The course instructors were not involved in any part of this study and no grades were awarded for participation to avoid any potential bias.

Adobe Acrobat  X  5.0 was used as reading application as it is widely used in publishing web documents, and provides excellent support to facilitate the active reading process. User interaction with the documents was logged using Lotus/IBM X  X  ScreenCam  X  , which unobtrusively recorded and stored all the screen activity.
All participants individually attended a short training session to familiarize themselves with the working envi-ronment. This training was necessary as Acrobat users are often unaware of the range of features available to them ( Mendoza &amp; Peterson, 2004 ). Later versions of Acrobat have come up with new techniques for improv-ing the visibility of various tools and options, but the versioning is not relevant for this study as this research was not about analyzing Acrobat features.

The two applications were made available on a workstation in a conveniently accessible computer lab in the school. Familiar surroundings were thus utilized and the researcher X  X  presence was minimized to ensure that the participants undertook the reading on their own and at their convenience. The absence of the researcher further strengthens the claim of unobtrusiveness as monitoring devices tend to be ignored or overlooked by participants when the investigator is not present ( Schneiderman, 1998 ). A downside of creating natural settings was that Verbal Protocols or think-aloud techniques could not be used in such a public site. In any case, the use of these techniques was not considered to maintain a peaceful and uninterrupted deep reading process. 3.2. Interaction procedures
In order to develop an initial classification of electronic marking categories and variables and to refine the methodology, a pilot study was conducted using five graduate students. The results helped in firming up the working procedures. The main study was then carried out using a between-subjects design. Eighteen partici-pants volunteered to take part in this study, and they were paid a monetary compensation. The participants were randomly divided into two groups, group I (individual) and group S (Shared). Two levels of the treat-ment (environment) were identified, and each group received one level ( Martin, 1991 ). These levels were read-ing in an  X  X ndividual X  or  X  X ocument sharing X  setting. Thereafter, members of Group I read private, individually owned documents, while the members of group S read documents by sharing them via circulation among the group members. The reading task for all readers was the same. The only exception was that the participants of the shared document readings were told that any markings that they make on the documents would be avail-able to, and viewed by, subsequent readers. Similarly, they themselves should expect markings on the articles that they read. Through this intervention in the regular reading practices of users, a better picture of the over-all interaction was expected. The methodology followed by these two participating groups is illustrated in Fig. 1 .

For group I, each of the nine students read one article per week for three weeks to prepare for next week X  X  class discussion, thus generating 27 articles. The same three articles were read by the nine participants of group
S, where each participant read those three articles in a document sharing environment. This sharing took place in multiple rounds, as per the schedule shown in Fig. 1 . For example, in the first round, the three articles were randomly assigned to three members of group S so that users 1, 4 and 7 got Article A to read in the first round of Week 1. The three read, and possibly marked, electronic articles obtained after the first round were reas-signed to three other participants in the second round, and this trend continued till the fourth round where the initiating readers got to review the markings made by other participants, and had a chance to add, delete, or edit the markings. This concluded the shared reading schedule for Week 1 and the project moved into Week 2 and 3, with the only changes being made in initiating reader and the article.

The logging software, ScreenCam  X  , unobtrusively monitored and recorded all the navigational activities and actions of the study participants while they read these electronic documents. This type of observation has been emphasized much ( Marshall et al., 1999 ), but rarely used in studies involving reading and marking electronic documents. The current study demonstrates how this innovative video recording procedure can pro-vide a rich qualitative dataset to inform user interface design, and help improve the design of the user inter-views. Moreover, the user responses during the interviews were cross checked with their actual reading and marking activities captured on videos to ensure that the derived findings are reliable and valid. A detailed account and analyses of the observed navigational activities, and their influence on informing the design of reading applications is presented elsewhere ( Qayyum &amp; Bilykh, 2006 ). 3.3. Interview design and qualitative data analyzing procedures
Semi-structured interviews were held with all participants once the readings were complete. The duration of these interviews was around 30 X 45 min, and the proceedings were audio-recorded with some note taking. The main exploratory purpose of these interviews was to seek an explanation from the participant for the functions of the markings that they made when actively reading a document. The interview sessions were augmented with the quantitative data provided by the user, such as the electronic documents that they marked and the video logs, so that an enriched understanding of their interaction was obtained. The researchers do realize that exploring inner experiences is not an easy task. To interrupt and investigate the process as it occurred would have meant compromising the natural settings. Therefore, of a particular concern here was the retrospective nature of reporting ( Nisbett &amp; Wilson, 1977 ).

To address the risks associated with retrospective reporting, the interviews were conducted in a one-to-one setting, and were augmented with other data to avoid the buildup of a priori causal theory by the participants.
The investigator studied all the video logs and established the participant X  X  general navigational and marking patterns before the interview. The time lapse between the last of the readings and the interview was kept to a minimum possible so that the whole interaction would still be fresh in the minds of the participants. Moreover, as the study was of very harmless nature therefore, the participants had nothing to gain from making false statements. No emotional or heated discussions took place, or personal or painful memory recalls were involved at any stage or time.

To further ensure the validity of results, crosschecking the responses of participants through multiple ques-tions was undertaken a few times during the interviews to ensure that the response closely matched the cog-nitive process when the activity occurred. For example, questions were sometimes asked about a marking activity before they were shown their actual markings, and the responses were then matched by any statement changes that they made after they had been shown their actual activities.

The interviews were transcribed and then analyzed with the help of NVIVO results, each function of the document marking was derived when at least two participants stated similar expe-riences. As most user experiences recorded in this study did not reflect public beliefs and opinions therefore, there was little chance that the participants were simply recalling some stereotype images.

Finally, focus and emphasis was always on finding user needs and requirements for a good reading and marking interface. With this foremost concern in mind, deficiencies that the users pointed out in the software used, Acrobat 5.0, were usually ignored. Thus the dependence on the software for deriving results was minimized.

A summary of the quantitative data collected from this study is presented in Table 1 , which takes into account some dropouts and data lost because of technical problems. 4. Analyzing the dataset
The participant pool was composed of eleven female and seven male students, and most participants were in the age bracket 26 X 35 years. Almost all of them reported daily computer usage. Approximately 70% said that they have had more than five years of experience in using word processors. With the exception of three people, all the participants were familiar with and had used Adobe Acrobat ments. Lastly, very few people (35%) reported sharing of annotated paper documents. However, a relatively higher number of users reported that they had shared annotated electronic documents (60%) by passing them around via e-mail or by utilizing a document management system.
 4.1. The findings from quantitative analysis 4.1.1. Exploring marking forms and their characteristics
One of the main themes explored during this study was investigating the types of marking made by users on electronic (e-) documents as they interacted with them. A classification of all the observed basic forms and characteristics of the user markings, or anchors, is shown in Table 2 ( shows that markings of the form  X  X  X ase markings X  X  were the most common anchors. This was followed by the categories  X  X  X ymbols/indicators X  X  and  X  X  X nnotations X  X .

Underlining (Mean  X  M = 8.3) was the most popular anchor used for marking text when the users were working individually, followed by highlighting (Mean  X  M = 7.1). However, these online marking trends showed a reversal in the document sharing environment where highlighting took over the top spot ( M = 21.6) followed by underlining ( M = 13.4). The total number of markings in the shared reading environ-ment was nearly double that of markings observed in the private readings. The sharpest increase was seen in the use of base markings, which increased from 58% of the total markings in private readings to constitute 88% of the total markings in shared conditions. Most of this increase seems to have come at the expense of symbol forming, which dropped from a high of 32% in private readings to just 4% of the total markings in the shared conditions. The use of single bars (lines) in margins ( M (Private) = 5.2, M (Shared) = 0.2) showed the biggest decline in this category. A modest decline in the use of annotations was also witnessed, but moving against the trend within this category was the increased usage of short sentences in shared readings ( M (Private) = 0.7, M (Shared) = 1.9). These annotations increased by more than three times when considering the number of observed instances. 4.1.2. Exploring the usage of markings A classification of all the observed instances for uses and placement of markings by readers is shown in
Table 3 . The marking distribution showed that most markings were positioned in the first half of the docu-ment for individual readers, but they were more evenly spread out when document sharing took place. This finding implies that non-sharing readers focused more on the initial parts of an e-document, while the atten-tion of readers who shared the documents was more evenly spread out. When the users did place marks, then marking first sentences ( M (Private) = 4.04, M (Shared) = 6.52) and marking keywords ( M (Private) = 4.0, M (Shared) = 9.3) were the most popular approaches in both types of reading environments. Also, most of the markings found on these documents were short (less than or equal to two lines), even more so in the case of document sharing situations ( M (Private) = 70%, M (Shared) = 80%), demonstrating that readers preferred not to make long marks (markings enveloping more than two lines). Finally, the annotation positioning and placement aspects, as were verified by the participants during the interview sessions, showed that over 80% of the annotations were related to the nearby text in both reading situations.

Summing up the differences in marking forms and usage between the individual and shared reading envi-ronment, some noticeable differences are clearly observable in the two classifications outlined in Tables 2 and 3 . Statistical analysis showed that the differences were statistically significant between several marking forms, characteristics, and marking approaches. However, the small sample size limits the validity and generalizabil-ity of the statistical tests and therefore, those findings will not be discussed here. Interested readers can find detailed results elsewhere ( Qayyum, 2005 ).

Compared to the limited quantitative data, the qualitative analysis of the rich dataset gathered from the user interviews, augmented by video observations, reveals some interesting findings and leads to logical system design conclusions. The detailed procedures for gathering and analyzing the interview and video data, while maintaining the reliability of the findings, are documented above in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 . 4.1.3. The qualitative approach to understanding marking forms 4.1.3.1. Highlighting. Within the base markings, highlighting was the most frequently created form of marking in the document sharing environment ( M = 21.6) and the second most commonly occurring activity in indi-vidual readings ( M = 7.1). So what was the function of this highlighting? The readers stated that they used highlighting to: (1) Identify keywords, or terms and phrases that were perceived as being key or important to the readers. (2) Place flags indicating the presence of main arguments. Three readers supported this assertion, with one (3) Spot themes in the text. Some readers remarked that they varied the colours of highlighting to identify 4.1.3.2. Underlining. Underlining was seemingly used for purposes similar to highlighting. However, the major difference was that while underlining was used mostly for supporting ideas, highlighting takes precedence over it as it indicates the presence of main keywords, themes, and ideas within an article. Therefore, highlighted text was considered indicative of something more important. Users mostly underlined to: (1) Setup pointers to supporting ideas. At least five readers supported this and one comment was:  X  X  X f some-(2) Indicate words to be looked up. Short underlining (1 X 3 words long) was used frequently for words, (3) Indicate a minor heading. Some of the readers perceived underlining to be a minor heading by itself, 4.1.3.3. Compound markings. A lesser-used and third type of base markings was the compound marking, where the readers made more than one type of marking on a single segment of text. Compound markings were observed more frequently in the document-sharing environment compared to the private reading environment.
The qualitative analysis indicated that readers mostly compounded their markings to: (1) Serve as a Self-reminder. (2) Emphasize the extreme importance of a text segment. (3) Create virtual relationships between text segments that were spatially apart. 4.1.3.4. Annotations. The second main marking group within the marking forms and characteristics was that of annotations. This category comprised short sentences, cryptic expressions, notes, and other writings. An integrated analysis indicated minor differences between the two environments when it came to making annotations. For example, the overall annotating trend showed a downward trend within the document-sharing environment, but short annotations and notes increased noticeably. However, little use of annotations for starting or continuing a discussion was observed. Only a few instances were observed where users placed a response to previous annotations, and one of them was mere grammar correction. Nor was there a con-scious effort to make the comments self-explanatory in sharing situations. Overall, annotations were made to: (1) Emphasize a passage. (2) Place bookmarks to separate the article into various topics or ideas. Remind the reader of some aspect of 4.1.3.5. Symbols/Indicators. Readers made circles, squares, asterisks or stars; placed single or double bars (straight lines) in margins (including placing bars on one or both sides of the text); drew pictures or symbolic illustrations (such as arrows or simple arrow-heads); or placed other straight or curved lines. Mostly, these symbols were placed to: (1) Link ideas. By encircling text segments and connecting them by lines, placing numbers, arrows, or (2) Create text zones for singling out similar ideas. 4.1.4. Understanding marking usages: A qualitative analysis
The second part of this analysis of the qualitative data was focused on deriving the users X  perception of the functions of the marking approaches, or the approaches taken to mark the text during the reading of e-doc-uments. These marking approaches were identified earlier in Table 3 .
 4.1.4.1. Marking positioning. Analysis of the way markings were positioned in the document indicated that: (1) First lines are considered as  X  X  X opic Sentences X  X . The readers perceived the first few lines of a paragraph (2) Visible text 5 is marked to: 4.1.4.2. Marking dimensions. The perceived functions of the short and long markings are: (1) Short markings are for succinct marking. Shorter markings (two lines or less) were generally prevalent (2) All vital points encapsulated in long markings. The longer markings were sometimes made by readers to 4.1.4.3. Annotating approaches. This aspect was explored considering the interest generated in the annotating system development community on the issue of repositioning user-made annotations ( Brush, Bargeron,
Gupta, &amp; Cadiz, 2001; Ovsiannikov, Arbib, &amp; McNeill, 1999 ). The findings of this study indicate that: (1) Margins were clearly the preferred place for annotating. Moreover, the ionized method of placing notes (2) Readers usually placed global annotations at extreme ends, while local annotations were placed in-con-4.1.5. Understanding the reading experiences of document sharing
Understandably, most electronic document readers, especially females, were uncomfortable about putting their names with their markings except if they were familiar with other group members. Putting markings on a public e-document was thus perceived as being similar to marking a library book. Most people wanted to start with a clean document, or one that had no markings. However, annotations or textual notes were given favourable consideration. For example, notes were favored in group work, as one participant declared:  X  X  X  would not mind occasional notes in the side margins but marking up the text, I find it irritating. X  X 
Readers were also more likely to place emphasis, or de-emphasis, on markings from a familiar person, as was indicated by the following comment:  X  X  X f I had known whose markings these were then I would have attached some importance, or for that matter unimportance to them, but I did not know [in this project] so it did not make a difference. X  X 
Previous marking were also more likely to attract new markings. Some readers marked a bit more just to maintain focus. Others tried to extract their own themes and build relationships by changing colours, or using other marking techniques. 5. Discussion of findings and their implication on system design
Based on the analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data gathered from this investigation of text mark-ing activity, some key issues emerged that affect the design of the reading applications in digital libraries. Sum-marized here are some of the key requirements and the resulting suggestions, which are not exhaustive but serve to illustrate the evidence and need for system design improvement. All findings of this study will initially be compared with the results from previous studies to identify supporting or contradictory outcomes. After that, the new and innovative findings and conclusions of this study will be discussed to demonstrate the con-tribution of this study to the knowledge base of online reading and marking the literature.

First of all, which is better, paper or electronic? While not trying to reach any conclusions in this endless debate, findings from the feedback received from the participating readers are summarized in Table 4 . The observed proportions of the three marking categories, base markings, annotations, and symbols were in har-mony with the previous research ( Marshall &amp; Brush, 2004 ) in case of shared readings only. A more even spread of marking types observed in individual reading conditions did not follow the same trend. However, the marking patterns of individual readers were consistent with the paper document marking habits reported by users, suggesting that perhaps there is not much difference in the types of markings that users make on paper and electronic document.

One clear fact that emerged from the marking classification was that underlining and highlighting are the dominant form of markings in e-document readings. This outcome is consistent with findings from previous two marking types was also witnessed when readers encountered previous markings and tried to identify the main points. These observations then lead to the innovative suggestion that user interface designers should focus on giving prominence to tools that facilitate these two actions. Acrobat has implemented one possible solution by providing short descriptions of each tool to the users ( Mendoza &amp; Peterson, 2004 ). Reducing the visible clutter of tools to improve the visibility of commonly used tools is another solution ( Qayyum &amp; Bilykh, 2006 ).

An important consideration derived from video observations and subsequent reader remarks was that the default colour and size of underlines should not be black and thin respectively. Otherwise, readers find it dif-ficult at times to distinguish between underlines that were placed by themselves or the previous readers, from the ones that had been provided by the e-document X  X  author. Similarly, the default-highlighting colour should not obscure source text. The best method to ensure good use of colours and sizes would be to create usage profiles for readers. These profiles could store information about the preferred colours, marking tools, and other environment settings for each reader.

While underlining was used mostly for supporting ideas, highlighting takes precedence over it as it was pri-marily used for indicating the main keywords. Therefore, information retrieval systems could provide support for searching user-highlighted areas in addition to the standard search areas, such as title, abstract, and iden-tifiers. Moreover, automated summarizing applications can differentiate and judge the importance of text within an article. Highlighted text segment can then potentially be included in an automated summary or an extract. This new finding can also guide the future progress of an algorithm by Shipman, Price, Marshall, and Golovchinsky (2003) for finding important passages based on user-provided annotations.

Another potentially useful finding of this study directly affects the retrieval systems and automated summa-rizing applications. The analysis clearly indicated that the first sentences of a paragraph were considered important by the participating readers in this study. Nist and Kirby X  X  (1989) research and eye-tracking find-ings of Stanford-Poynter Institute (2005) also show a similar trend. The Institute X  X  finding indicates that online newspaper readers read more attentively when presented with headlines and a few lines of blurbs for each news item. Therefore, the implication of this finding is that designing the layout of a journal article could follow the same approach of presenting the user with minimal summary information to start with. Utilizing these tech-niques, an entire article could initially be presented on one page, and the users could click and expand the rel-evant sections of their interest.

The finding that highlighting indicates main ideas while underlining represents supporting ideas gives rise to an alternative idea of flipping the marking tool design around. Thus, an innovative recommendation of this study would be that the users be given the alternative of picking marking options instead of selecting marking tools from the menu. For example, if the user perceives text within an article to be a central idea, then the option selected from the menu is  X  X  X ark key idea X  X  instead of selecting a highlighting tool. Similarly, if the user wanted to highlight a supporting idea then the relevant option (underlining) is picked up from the menu instead of selecting the underlining tool. However, the actual marks appearing on the text, for the above stated cases, could still be highlighting and underlining respectively. Similarly, other options, such as term lookups, keyword marking, idea linking, etc., could be designed according to the functions catalogued in this research, or user profiles be used to build marking tools. This standardized marking procedure should help maintain a consistency in user markings that software agents, as are envisaged in a Semantic Web environment, recognize and utilize during their search and retrieval activities. This study also indicates that readers forget why certain they made certain markings, and having the option to know whether it was a key idea or a supporting idea will help them with recall.

One notable difference between paper and electronic environments was that e-document readers generally preferred to make other types of markings rather than write annotations. However, there was a high occur-rence of short sentences and notes in document sharing situations, signifying user interest in communicating thoughts to other readers. The reader feedback also indicated that annotations were the most sought after marking type in sharing situations, and most users would like to see minimal amounts of other types of mark-ings. These results are in agreement with previous research ( Simpson &amp; Nist, 1990 ) and indicate the need for better annotating support for the prevalent majority of keyboard/mouse based readers.

In the same context, an important implication here is that the visibility of electronic annotations needs to be given priority. This is because most participants in this study used, and voiced their support for annotating tools that show text (keep it visible) at all times. Annotations that can be minimized into an icon were not preferred. In the same context, a redesign of annotating procedures should also offer a variety of orientation options so that the annotations can be placed horizontally or vertically. This is because some readers men-tioned that they did not place elaborate remarks because the margins were too narrow and they are used to writing long sentences horizontally on paper documents. This need exists because the current trends of writ-ing horizontally only do not allow longer comments to be placed in the narrow margins of an electronic article.
The computer designers can then easily design applications that allow users to enter text in a normal manner, and for reader to read simply with mouse-overs.

The readers in this study were strongly in favour of initiating their reading with a clean document. This finding supported O X  X ara and Sellen X  X  (1997) suggestion of making the markings functionally distinct from the original text. Therefore, no updates should be visible on the document unless the reader requests them.
Once the reader is ready to view previous markings, layers of markings could be made available. The reader would then have a choice of superimposing any one, or more of those layers on the document. This concept is an extension of the Xlibris X  X  multiple annotation overlaying concept, which superimposed multi-user mark-ings on a document ( Marshall, et al. 1999 ). Each of these layers could then contain markings of one or more (possibly groups) of previous readers. User responses in the present study also indicated that readers were more likely to place emphasis, or de-emphasis, on markings from a familiar person. Thus, marking layers con-taining markings from known users may be preferred, or not preferred according to the task and context.
Knowing the identities of users may not be a problem in groups or smaller communities as most readers indicated that they were comfortable about sharing identities among a known group of people. However, marking a public document and associating personal names with it was not seen in a positive light. Therefore, as indicated by a previous study ( Wolfe &amp; Neuwirth, 2001 ) also, these privacy issues need to be catered to when designing a shared reading system.

Finally, the reader feedback on marking positioning data indicated that it might be acceptable if an anno-tation is not repositioned right next to its original position, but remained in the noticeable vicinity. This find-ing of the current study could have important implications for the system designers looking to reposition annotations in case of orphaned annotations. The repositioning algorithms could then focus on placing the orphaned annotations close to the re-edited or revised text. The case of global comments placed at extreme ends, or away from the source text, is simpler as the repositioning algorithms can simply leave their position unchanged. 6. Limitations
Several limitations of this study deserve mention here. First, this study was limited to the use of one com-puter application, that is, Adobe Acrobat  X  5.0. Use of another application may yield different results. This sin-gle application usage was necessary to ensure that a common environment and a universal set of marking tools would be available to all readers. Moreover, since all participants of this study used the same application and received training in its usage, the application specific effects were expected to be neutral across the sample. Therefore, no change in findings is expected if this study is carried out using a newer version of Acrobat.
A second limitation is that through the introduction of this active reading process using an electronic read-ing/editing system, an intervention into the users X  regular reading practices was made. These regular reading habits normally revolve around taking a printout of an electronic article and reading it on paper. By allowing this intervention to happen, a better picture of how the users interact with electronic documents, when they read with the option to mark it, was obtained. However, this intervention may limit the study X  X  generalizability to novice users reading e-documents on an active reading system in relatively early stages of usage.
Thirdly, this study was performed on graduate student readers reading electronic research articles for a spe-cific task in a controlled setting. A field study may influence the results in some other manner. For example,
Nist and Kirby (1989) suggest that a study conducted on business users, analysts, technical or leisure readers faced with a different task may yield different types and structures of markings and their functions. A major hurdle in carrying out a field experiment is that of locating user groups that utilize reading and marking appli-cations while sharing e-documents. Marking tools need to be considerably improved before such common usage becomes a reality, and this study is one step in that direction.

While these limitations restrict the generalizability of this study, the results do portray the text marking and activity patterns of student readers accessing electronic documents. This conclusion is derived because of the comprehensive data set (listed in Table 1 ) used for deriving the study results. 7. Conclusions
This baseline study noted that both technical and social aspects of human computer interaction need to be considered before designing a computer-based reading and marking system for a digital library. Otherwise, the users of electronic documents may feel restricted while using these systems. As Marshall (2004) points out, a common remedy assumed is that the next generation of pen-based reading and marking tablet systems are going to facilitate document marking. While admittedly there have been many developments in computer-based annotating software that facilitate information sharing, the focus of related user studies is usually on the features of the system itself. However, the process of human document interaction is much wider in scope and requires focused research on issues that led to the development of the system in the first place. Otherwise, a lack of general acceptance and usage of marking applications among e-document readers will continue to exist. This study was developed as a first step to study this interaction and it is hoped that the findings of this research effort will lead to the development of improved reading and marking applications.
