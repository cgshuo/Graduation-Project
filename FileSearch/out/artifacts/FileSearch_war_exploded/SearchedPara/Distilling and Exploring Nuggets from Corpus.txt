 H.3.1 [ Information Systems ]: Information Storage and Retrieval X  Content Analysis and Indexing User Interfaces, Natural Language Processing, Automatic Content Extraction, Summarization
This paper describes a live and scalable system that au-tomatically extracts information nuggets for entities/topics from a continuously updated corpus for effective exploration and analysis. A nugget is a piece of semantic information that (1) must be mapped semantically to the transitive clo-sure of a pre-defined ontology, (2) is explicitly supported by text, and (3) has a natural language description that com-pletely conveys its semantic to a user. Fig. 1 shows a type of nugget  X  X nvolvement in events X  for a person entity (Leon Panetta): each nugget has a short description ( X  X eeting X ,  X  X ews conference X ) with a list of supporting passages.
Our key contributions are (1) We extract nuggets and re-move redundancy to produce a summary of salient informa-tion with supporting clusters of passages. (2) We present an entity/topic centric exploration interface that also allows users to navigate to other entities involved in a nugget. (3) We use the statistical NLP technologies developed over the years in the ACE[6] ,GALE [5] and TAC-KBP[7] programs, including parsing, mention detection, within and cross docu-ment coreference resolution, relation detection and slot filler extraction. (4) Our system is flexible and easily adaptable across domains as demonstrated on two corpora: generic news and scientific papers. Search engines such as Google News and Scholar[1, 2] do not retrieve nuggets, and only remove redundancy at document level. News aggregation applications such as Evri[3] categorize news articles based on the entities of topics but do not extract nuggets. Other systems extract richer information, but not all of it has clear semantics; e.g., Silobreaker[4] presents results as  X  X he rela-tionship between X and Y in the context of [keyphrase] X , leaving users with the task of interpreting the semantics as it is not tied to a clear ontology. In contrast we remove re-dundancy, summarize results and present nuggets that have clear semantics.
