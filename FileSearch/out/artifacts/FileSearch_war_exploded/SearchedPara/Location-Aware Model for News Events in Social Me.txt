 Nowadays, social media services are being used extensively as news sources and for spreading information on real-world events. Several studies have focused on detecting those events and locating them geographically. However, in order to study real-world events, for example, finding relationships between locations or detecting high impact events based on their coverage, we need more suitable models to represent events. In this work we propose a simple model to represent real-world news events using two sources of information: the locations that are mentioned in the event (where the event occurs), and the locations of users that discuss or comment on it. We then characterize a country based on the amount of events in which that country is mentioned and also partici-pates on the event. We show some applications of the model: we find clusters of news events based on the level of partici-pation of countries, identifying global and impactful events in certain areas. Also, we show groups of similar countries, finding promising insights about their relationships. This model can be useful at finding unsuspected relations among countries based on the news coverage and country partici-pation, identifying different levels of news coverage in the world, and finding bias in international news sources.

Online Social Networks (OSN) such as Twitter 1 , Face-book 2 , and Sina Weibo 3 have become important sources of news. In particular, Twitter is nowadays a central part of information spread, as one of its main functions is to pass along information as news stories develop. When a break-ing news event happens, Twitter users react to it by posting messages about the subject and quickly broadcasting the information to other users.

Twitter is an OSN and social media service that enables users to post messages of 140 characters. These messages, called tweets , can also include hyperlinks and can be geo-tagged with exact coordinates, depending on the location of the user. Even if the location is not provided, it is possible to infer an approximate location by analyzing the text of the tweets, or the location included in the author X  X  profile description.
 Also, with the increasing amount of GPS-enabled devices, OSN have enabled the ability of geotagging messages ac-cording to the location from they were posted. Even with-out these capabilities, users can assign a location to a mes-sage, or the location can be inferred from the message X  X  text, etc. In particular, this allows researchers to study the inter-actions on OSN by looking at the spatial dimension. By examining the geotagged messages, it is possible to study information propagation, event detection, visualization of trends, etc.

It is necessary to model events accordingly in order to gain valuable insights about them. Placing the events in a map is useful for understanding what is happenning and where , but we need more suitable tools to study general trends about news events ( how it is happening) and the role the geographical locations play in the propagation and im-pact of the events ( why it is happening), especially on a large scale. For example, we would want to answer queries such as: which news events and which countries where these news events occurred are currently impacting Southeast Asia, or which countries are being impacted by news events taking place in Spain.

Our main goal is to find a representation of news events that allows us to answer the following research questions: 1. Can we identify groups of news that have similar prop-https://twitter.com https://facebook.com http://weibo.com 2. Which news is truly global in terms of the locations 3. Which news is causing high impact to certain loca-4. How biased are certain news sources according to the
We propose a model for news events disseminated in OSN streams that considers the geographical location information of an event. This information comes from two sources: the locations of places where the event occurs, and the locations of users that participate in the event in the social network.
Our model is a simple way to represent news events based on the location data extracted from the social media messa-ges related to them. With this representation in mind, we show that we can find relationships between sources of infor-mation and the impacted locations, in terms of the messages posted in those locations. This can be useful in finding rela-tions of causality between news events, identifying different levels of news coverage in the world (finding biases or the influence of news media in certain places), tracking news events in social media streams, and discovering unsuspected relationships among countries or conflicts, etc.

We show some applications of the model using a dataset of news events collected from Twitter. We show clusters of locations where events took place and users participate in them, illustrating that we can find high impact events based on news coverage, or to study the bias or the influence of a certain news source using these locations. Also, we compare some selected countries based on the events that took place in these locations, discovering relationships between coun-tries. In terms of Information Retrieval applications, with this kind of model it would be possible to find events similar to a given event, to retrieve events based on certain given features, or to rank events and countries based on the level of participation of users on OSN.
As social networks have grown in popularity, several re-search studies have focused on event detection and charac-terization in social media streams, in particular, on detect-ing and geotagging events. For example, localized [9, 1, 8], global [7], or critical [4, 5] events. However, they do not place much attention on the representation of events in or-der to perform more in-depth studies of the events identified. We did not find many studies related to event modeling or event representation from social media messages.

Regarding models of social media data, in the work of Ka-math et al. [3], the authors carried out a large-scale study of the spatio-temporal dynamics of Twitter hashtags (a hash-tag is a user-generated string prefixed by # that users can include in a tweet as a way to associate it with an event or to a topic). They represented a hashtag as a tuple consisting in the location coordinates of the hashtag. A simple model is used to find interesting insights about social media memes. However, these memes may not necessarily correspond to real-world events.

Our work does not focus on the event detection problem, but rather on the event representation, to gain insight from events, where it is not possible to do so in other models.
We propose a novel and simple way to represent an event based on the location data extracted from social media me-ssages that cover the topic. We identify two dimensions of the problem: first, the countries where the news originated ( protagonist countries ), and secondly, the countries from where users talk about the news ( participating countries ). Using both concepts we define a matrix that characterizes the locations based on the level of protagonism and partic-ipation of them in the events. We can represent an event by the protagonist countries, the participating countries, or both.

Let E = { e 1 , e 2 , . . . , e N } be a set of events. Each news where C protagonist is the set of protagonist countries and C participating is the set of participating countries in the event. By also having the total amount of messages posted from each participating country, C participating can be defined as the set of pairs ( c, total messages c ), storing the total messa-ge information for country c .

We now define a matrix M which we call protagonism-participation matrix . Each cell M ij contains the amount of events from E which contain the country c i as a protago-nist country and the country c j as a participation country, 1  X  i, j  X  total countries. Each row of the matrix is called protagonism-participation vector , v i , which characterizes a particular country c i . By also having the amount of messa-ges associated with each participating country in an event, we can extend the definition of the matrix by weighting each cell by the average amount (or any other suitable function) of messages posted from country c j in all the correspond-ing events. We leave this extension to the matrix as future work.
 Formally, each cell of the matrix is defined as follows:
And the protagonism-participation vector v i is defined as follows: where v j is the the total amount of events which have country c i as protagonist country and country c j as partici-pation country, 1  X  j  X  total countries.

The idea behind the model is that we represent a country c by the level of participation that other countries have on the events that took place in c . With this, we can find relationships between countries. Also, we consider an event as the tuple consisting on the protagonist and participating countries, so we can not only locate events in a map, but also we can find the countries which participate in the event. For example, to assess the impact of events based on their coverage.
Using a dataset of news events collected from Twitter, we computed the event representation described in the previous section, and the protagonism-participation matrix. We show that we can identify global and impactful events in terms of their coverage using cluster analysis, and that we can find similar countries based on the countries that participate in the news that mention the similar ones, using Euclidean distance between protagonism-participation vectors.
We used a dataset of approximately 18,000 news events collected from Twitter dating from August 2013 until May 2014. Each event consists of a set of tweets describing or commenting the occurrence. Using manually selected veri-fied Twitter news accounts (such as CNN, BBC, AP, etc.), we collected news headlines, identified recurring words in the headlines, and then used these words to perform searches in Twitter to retrieve tweets that cover each news, using the Twitter REST API [2]. An observation worth noting is that most of the news accounts correspond to American or En-glish sources, so the dataset is biased to news events from these sources.
 We employed an open source library for geotagging text, CLAVIN [6] (Cartographic Location And Vicinity INdexer) to identify locations from the tweets. We geotagged each tweet alone by looking at its text and its author X  X  informa-tion (discarding the messages to which it was not possible to associate with a location), yielding the participating coun-tries for every event. On the other hand, we considered the text of all the tweets belonging to an event as a single doc-ument, and then we identified the protagonist countries for that event, by choosing the most mentioned locations in the tweets.
We first performed a cluster analysis of the participat-ing countries of the events. Recall that the participating countries are the countries from where users post messages about the event. Using the number of tweets as the amount of messages for each country, we used the k -means clustering algorithm with parameter k = 4 to identify clusters of vec-tors representing the most common participating countries across the events. Figure 1 shows the clusters in maps with the four participation clusters. Figure 1a shows a higher cov-erage in Indonesia, followed by the United States, while Fig-ure 1b shows coverage world-wide, notoriously in the United States, the United Kingdom (recall that most of the news sources are from these locations), and Indonesia. Figure 1c shows participation only from Indonesia, while Figure 1d is similar to Figure 1b, but with lesser participation from the United States. We consider a higher level of coverage as the result of high impact news to these locations, allowing us to identify critical events on the social network.
 Table 1: Euclidean distance between protagonism-participation vectors corresponding to selected countries. Lower value means higher similarity.
Using the protagonism-participation vectors, we find si-milar groups of countries through hierarchical cluster analy-sis. We compare countries using a simple visual approach by representing the countries by their corresponding protagonism-participation vectors as heatmaps. In this article we only illustrate selected examples from the resulting clustering so-lution.

Table 1 shows the computed Euclidean distance between the protagonism-participation vectors corresponding to Brazil, Germany, Ukraine, Russia, Israel and Palestine, based on the news events in the dataset. The resulting pairs of simi-lar countries can be explained by the recurring news events related to them (e.g., the conflict in Ukraine, or the soccer match between Germany and Brazil in the 2014 FIFA World Cup).

Figures 2a, 2b, and 2c show heatmaps of pairs of coun-tries in the same cluster: Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Palestine, and Germany and Brazil, while Figure 2d shows two dissimilar countries, the United States and the United Kingdom. It can be seen that the pairs of heatmaps are vi-sually similar, and different from the other pairs (also doc-umented in Table 1 using Euclidean distance). Russia and Ukraine share the most similar heatmaps, followed by Israel and Palestine. This can be explained by the recurring events concerning these countries. The case of Germany and Brazil can be explained by the events triggered in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The similarity between the vectors correspond-ing to Germany and Brazil is not as low compared to the other pairs (as shown in Table 1), and this could be reflecting the fact that the corresponding news events happened in a short time interval (days), as opposed to the events concern-ing the other countries (months). Finally, the last heatmap (Figure 2d) shows two dissimilar countries, illustrating that the method is useful to find relationships between countries based on the news events that took place in these locations.
This approach shows that the countries share properties related to the news events that happened in these locations. Figure 2: Heatmaps comparing protagonism-participation vectors between pairs of selected countries. The x -axis of the heatmap corresponds to the countries (country names were omitted for clarity), and the color (participation value) cor-responds to the scaled (zero mean and unit variance) amount of events in which the countries participate in the events in which the given country is protagonist.
 Also, it is possible to recognize the most participating coun-tries by looking at the heatmap (country labels were re-moved from the figures for the sake of readability). We can find unexpected relationships between countries using this approach by just inspecting the resulting heatmaps.
We proposed a simple model to represent events from so-cial media, using the location information included in the messages related to the events. Using two dimensions of the problem (the locations where the event occurred and the locations of users who participate in the event), we define a matrix of the amount of events participating in a certain country, characterizing countries based on the corresponding events. We conducted a cluster analysis of the resulting vec-tors, showing that it is possible to find global and impactful events based on the coverage of news, and relationships be-tween countries based on their participation in news events, using a visual approach.

Future work includes extending the model, considering the level of participation of countries in the analysis, perform-ing a large scale study of news events, and formalizing the kind of queries that can be done to the model in terms of a event search engine system. In particular, by clustering par-ticipation countries we can find biases of news sources by analyzing only news of selected sources. Also, by comparing different countries using protagonism-participation vectors we can find unsuspected relationships based on several news events involving these countries. We expect to extend these analyses to show even more promising results.
