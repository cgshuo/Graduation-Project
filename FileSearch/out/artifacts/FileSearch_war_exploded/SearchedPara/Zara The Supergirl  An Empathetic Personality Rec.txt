  X  X orry I didn X  X  hear you X  maybe the first empathetic utterance by a commercial machine. Since the late 1990s when the Boston company SpeechWorks In-ternational began providing their customer-service software to other numerous companies, which was programmed to use different phrases, people have gotten used to speaking to machines. As people in-teract more often by voice and gesture, they expect the machines to have more emotional intelligence, and understand other high level communication fea-tures such as humor, sarcasm and intention. In or-der to make such communication possible, the ma-chines need an empathy module in them, which is a software system that can extract emotions from hu-man speech and facial expressions, and can accord-ingly decide the correct response of the robot. Al-though research on empathetic robots is still in the primary stage, current methods involve using signal processing techniques, sentiment analysis and ma-chine learning algorithms to make robots that can  X  X nderstand X  human emotion (Fung, 2015).

We propose Zara the Supergirl as a prototype sys-tem. It is a web program running on a server in the cloud. It is basically a virtual robot, with an animated cartoon character to present itself on the screen. Along the way it will get  X  X marter X  and more empathetic, by having machine learning algorithms, and gathering more data and learning from it. Later stage would involve installing the program into a humanoid robot, and therefore give Zara a physical body. 2.1 Design and Training Zara X  X  current task is a conversational MBTI per-sonality assessor and we designed 6 categories of personality-assessing questions, each named as a  X  X tate X , in attempts to assess the user X  X  personal-ity (Polzehl et al., 2010). These 6 states inquire about the user X  X  earliest childhood memory, his or her last vacation, challenges at work, creative story-telling, friendship, and affinity toward human-robot conversations. Each state comprises of a series of questions, beginning with one opening inquiry with follow-up questions depending on the length of the user X  X  preceding response. Each user is allocated 5-6 minutes to complete the personality assessment (ap-prox. 1-2 minutes per question). The tests are con-ducted independently using url link rendered on a browser using built-in microphone and camera on Macs and PCs.

A dialog management system with different states is designed to control the flow of the conversation, which consists of one part machine-initiative ques-tions from Zara and answers from human users, and another part user-initiative questions and challenges to Zara. 2.2 Facial and Speech Recognition At the beginning of the conversation with the user, the program waits until a face is detected. The face recognition algorithm analyses the image captured by the computer X  X  webcam to guess a possible gen-der and ethnicity.

For our speech recognition module, we use En-glish audio data with 1385hrs from LDC corpora and public domain corpora for acoustic model train-ing. We train our acoustic models by Kaldi speech recognition toolkit (Povey et al., 2011). We train deep neural network (DNN) HMMs with 6 hid-den layers. The DNN is initialized with stacked restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) which are pre-trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. Cross-entropy (CE) criterion DNN training is first applied on the state alignments produced by discriminative trained GMM-HMMs. State alignment is then re-produced with DNN-HMMs, and DNN training with CE criterion is done again. Finally, sequence dis-criminative training on DNN-HMMs with state level minimum Bayes risk (sMBR) criterion is applied.
Our text data contains 88.6M sentences. It com-prises acoustic training transcriptions, web crawled news and book data, Cantab filtering sentences on Google 1 billion word LM benchmark, weather domain queries, music domain queries and com-mon chat queries. We train witten-bell smooth-ing interpolated trigram language model (LM) and CE based recurrent neural network (RNN) LM us-ing the SRI-LM toolkit (Stolcke and others, 2002) and CUED-RNNLM toolkit (Chen et al., 2016) re-spectively. The ASR decoder performs search on weighted finite state transducer (WFST) graph for trigram LM and generates lattice, and then performs lattice rescoring with RNN LM. The decoder is de-signed for input audio data that is streamed from TCP/IP or HTTP protocol, and performs decoding in real time. The decoder supports simultaneous users by multiple threads and user queue. The ASR system achieves 7.6% word error rate on our clean speech test data. 2.3 Audio features for emotion recognition The dataset we used for training speech emotion recognition is from the Emotional Prosody Speech and Transcripts, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) 237-6 (Liberman et al., 2002). The recordings con-tain audio and transcripts, which consist of profes-sional actors reading a series of semantically neutral utterances (dates and numbers). There are 15 senti-ments, 7 subjects and a total number of 2445 utter-ances. Each subject reads around 3,000 seconds.
We use openSMILE (Eyben et al., 2010) to ex-tract features from LDC dataset. The features are calculated based on the INTERSPEECH 2009 Emo-tion Challenge feature set for emotion recognition. The final features are computed from a series of in-put frames and output a single static summary vec-tor, e.g, the smooth methods, maximum and min-imum value, mean value of the features from the frames (Liscombe et al., 2003).

For each sentiment, there are around 170 utter-ances. We implement an SVM learning method on the binary classification. We first construct a bal-anced dataset for each sentiment by choosing the same number of utterances per sentiment. Then we split the data into three categories, i.e. training, de-veloping and testing parts in the ratio 6:2:2. We train the SVM with linear kernel and the maximum iter-ation time is 5,000. The development set is used to tune the number of iteration times. The model is chosen from the highest accuracy results from the development set (results given in figure 3). 2.4 Language understanding for sentiment In the first version of Zara, sentiment analysis is based on natural language understanding of lexi-cal features. We look for keyword matches from a pool of positive and negative emotion lexicons from tive scores, and the negative lexicons have negative scores (Pennebaker et al., 2015). Moreover, when a negate word ( X  X o not X ,  X  X annot X , etc) is present along with the emotion words, then the score is adjusted accordingly (for example,  X  X  am not at all happy X  would have a negative score, even though  X  X appy X  is a positive emotion lexicon).

If there are more than five words in a sentence, then a n-gram model is used containing a number of 5 grams, which is then further analysed to give a total sentiment score across all the 5-grams. This tends to perform better than non n-gram methods in the case for long sentences. 2.5 Personality Analysis We designed a set of personal questions in six dif-ferent domains in order to classify user personal-ity from among sixteen different MBTI personality tains about 70 questions. We asked a group of train-ing users to answer this questionnaire but also an-swer questions from Zara. The personality type gen-erated by the MBTI questionnaire is used as the gold standard label for training the Zara system. Based on user answers to Zara X  X  questions, scores are calcu-lated in four dimensions (namely Introversion -Ex-troversion, Intuitive -Sensing, Thinking -Feeling, Judging -Perceiving).

We use the output of the sentiment analysis from language and emotion recognition from speech as linguistic and speech cues to calculate the score for each personality dimension based on previous re-search (Mairesse et al., 2007). For each response, the individual score for each of the four dimensions is calculated and updated, and the final score in each dimension is the group average of all the responses. The personality test consists mostly of machine-initiative questions from Zara and human answers. However, as described in the user analysis section below, there are scenarios where the user does not respond to questions from Zara directly. 24.62% of the users who tried Zara exhibited some form of verbal challenge in their responses during the dia-logue conversation, of which 37.5% of users evade the questions with an irrelevant answer. 12.5% of users challenged Zara X  X  ability more directly with questions unrelated to the personality test.
Challenge here refers to user responses that were difficult to handle and impeded the flow of conversa-tion with Zara. They include the following 6 types: 1. Seeking disclosure reciprocity; 2. Asking for clarification; 3. Avoidance of topic; 4. Deliberate challenge of Zara X  X  ability; 5. Abusive language; 6. Garbage.

Several of the above categories can be observed in human-human interactions. For instance, seek-ing disclosure reciprocity is not uncommon in hu-man conversations (Wheeless and Grotz, 1977).
Responses that revealed some form of avoidance of topic was the largest response group. Avoidance in psychology is viewed as a coping mechanism in response to stress, fear, discomfort, or anxiety (Roth and Cohen, 1986). In the dataset collected, two types of avoidance were observed. Users who ac-tively avoid the topic specifically reveal their unwill-ingness to continue the conversation ( X  X  dont want to talk about it X ,  X  X  am in no mood to tell you a story Zara X ) while users who adopts a more passive strat-egy had the intent to discontinue the conversation implied ( X  X et X  X  continue. X ,  X  X ake it a quick one X ,  X  X ou know... X ).

Abusive language includes foul, obscene, cultur-ally and socially inappropriate remarks and the like. Currently collected data revealed surprisingly few inappropriate comments such as  X  X et lost now X  and  X  X one of your business X . These challenges are com-paratively mild. Owing to the context of Zara X  X  role as a personality assessor, the reasons here for abuse could be the need to trust the robotic assessor and feeling of discomfort instead of the common en-joyment or group thinking reasons (Nomura et al., 2015).

Asking for clarification examples included  X  X an you repeat? X  and  X  X an you say it again? X . Clarifica-tion questions observed in this dataset are primarily non-reprise questions as a request to repeat a previ-ous utterance (Purver, 2004).

Deliberate challenge of a robot X  X  ability was also observed. This took the form of direct requests ( X  X an I change a topic? X ,  X  X hy can X  X  you speak English? X  in the Chinese mode), or statements un-related to the questions asked ( X  X hich one is 72.1 percent? X ).

Zara is programmed with a gentle but witty per-sonality to handle different user challenges. For ex-ample, when abusive language is repeatedly used against her, she would ask for an apology after ex-pressing concern for the user X  X  level of stress. If the user asks a general domain question unrelated to the personality test (e.g.  X  X hat is the population of Hong Kong X ), Zara will try to entertain the question with an answer from a general knowledge database tana. However, unlike these other systems, Zara will not chat indefinitely with the user but will remind the user of their task at hand, namely the personality test. We are also working on a second approach for the audio emotion recognition. This uses a deep neural audio database as training data. A total of around 200 hours of TED audio data was used, and was la-belled in 13-second frames. This labelled data was used to train a binary classifier of 11 different mood categories.

An FFmpeg command-line software is used to ex-tract the envelop of the raw audio input. Each value is a 16-bit integer. Since the sample rate is 8 kHz and each training sample is around 10 seconds in length, the input dimension should be 80,000. We set 5 ms (40 integers) as the window size and 3.25 ms (26 in-tegers) as the moving step for the first convolutional layer. The regional max-pooling layer takes 40 vec-tors each time. The window size of the second con-volutional layer is 26 which is slightly smaller than the first one. The moving step is 1. We execute the maximum function over all the vectors of the outputs of the second pooling layer.

There are two convolutional, two max-pooling and one embedding layers in the CNN model. The first convolutional layer accepts a short period of au-dio as input. Then the model moves to convolute the adjacent period of audio with fixed overlap of last period, and the vector input is converted into a matrix. The next layer, max-pooling layer, is a form of non-linear down-sampling. It partitions the input matrix into a set of non-overlapping smaller matrices. For each sub-region, it outputs the entry-wise maximum value in one dimension. The second max-pooling layer is to output the entry-wise max-imum on the entire matrix instead of sub-regions, which outputs a vector. The embedding layer per-forms similar function as that of a multi layer per-ceptron, which maps the vector into a probabilistic distribution over all categories (Palaz and Collobert, 2015) (Golik et al., 2015). We have demonstrated a prototype system of an em-pathetic virtual robot that can recognize user per-sonalities from speech, language and facial cues. It is too early to say that the time of empathetic and friendly robots has arrived. We have so far devel-oped only the most primary tools that future emo-tionally intelligent robots would need. The empa-thetic robots including Zara that are there currently, and the ones that will be there in the near future, might not be completely perfect. However, the most significant step is to make robots to be more human like in their interactions. This means it will have flaws, just like humans do. If this is done right, then future machines and robots will be empathetic and less likely to commit harm in their interactions with humans. They will be able to get us, understand our emotions, and more than anything, they will be our teachers, our caregivers, and our friends.
