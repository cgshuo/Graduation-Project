 The analysis of search transaction logs often characterizes a search session but rarely looks at the end point. When do users stop, and what cues are present suggesting that stopping is eminent? In this pre liminary analysis of th e logs of 288 search sessions conducted in a laborator y setting, we identified the activity performed by participants as well as search transitions that were invoked over the course of a search session. The 4331 search transitions (15 per task on average) contained a total of 9295 actions. We isolated the fi nal transition in each search session for detailed analysis. As hypothesized some behaviours are predictable, and suggestive of stopping behavior, with the potential for modeling.

Interactive IR, Search Stopping Behaviour, Human Experiment Analyses of search transaction logs often characterize search sessions but rarely look at the e nd point. When do users stop, and what cues are present suggesting that stopping is likely? Knowing that a search is about to be brought to a close can provide some valuable clues about the scope of a search and about the potential for success. In this research we examined the results of a human laboratory experiment to determine if a searcher X  X  stopping decision process is reflected in distinct behaviour patterns during the final stage of a search. In this preliminary analysis, we present some initial results that characterize ending behavior. Stopping behaviour has been explor ed in past research although little empirical work has been done. Cooper [1] posited a utility theoretic approach that tied search length to the trade-off between information utility and search effort. A related approach [2, 3] modeled search as a rational d ecision process, in which stopping is governed by a set of rules: the Satiation rule assumes that stopping occurs when enough relevant documents have been viewed to satisfy the need; the Disgust rule assumes that stopping occurs when more than an acceptable number of irrelevant documents have been viewed; a nd the Combination rule assumes that searchers stop when satiated or disgusted, whichever comes first. Satisficing [4, 5] offers another framework, perhaps better suited to understanding stopping behavi our in full-text, interactive systems; it suggests that searcher s continually weigh the costs and potential benefits of continuing to search. A small number of information seeking and retrie val studies have shown stopping decisions to be dependent upon ta sk type, time constraints and a range of more specific internally constructed stopping rules [6, 7]. Using a custom-built, highly inte ractive search interface to the Wikipedia corpus, 96 participan ts (M=49, F=47), primarily university students from a range of disciplines, each completed three assigned tasks from a set of 12 that were developed for INEX 2007 Interactive Track. Tasks were designed to represent a range of task types, and to ensu re that no search task could be completed using a single Wikipedia page. A set of 13 actions taken by searchers were recorded in the transaction log and coded semi-a utomatically. These included: issuing a query or re-loading a que ry from history; viewing a page from results, the bookbag, list of suggestions, or page history; adding pages to a bookbag; and bl ocking a page from display. Actions within the search process are rarely independent. To capture and isolate broader cognitive steps in the search process, we applied Pharo X  X  [8] Search Situation Transition Schema to group actions into transitions. 13 distinct transition types were identified and manually coded. Examples include: a) issue a query, view results, and view a page; b) re-load query from history, re-view results; c) re-load a page from the Bookbag. While the 13 transitions were unique, they clearly had a core intent which we characterized as primarily to: a) issue a query, b) examine search results, c) view pages, d) re-do or re-examine something done previously, e.g., re-issue a query stored in the history. The 96 participants experienced 4331 transitions over their three tasks or 15 transitions on average per task. To examine stopping behavior, we consider the transition type and the actions contained in the final transition coded for each search session. Final transitions executed by par ticipants constitute from 4% to 6% of the total number of transitions in each of the four aggregate transition types (Figure 1). Figure 1: Final transitions by Aggregate Transition Type Taken individually, three of the 13 transitions stand out as dominant ending behaviours. 23% of sessions ended with the typical pattern of: issue a query, examine results, and view a page. 20% ended with the searcher viewing pages from second and subsequent results pages, and 17.5% ended with searchers following a link embedded on a page. The other transition types were less common as stopping beha viours, varying from 0% to 8.4%. We also examined the individual actions taken by searchers. Figure 2 shows the proportion of actions executed during final transitions compared to actions executed during the remainder of the transitions. The percentage is used to normalize the data, as significantly more actions took place in the initial stages of the process. Figure 2: Comparison of Actions in Final and Non-Final Transitions Some actions stand out. For example, a higher proportion of bookbag and to viewing pages, bot h from results pages and links embedded in pages. Proportionally fewer queries were issued and results pages were viewed during the final transitions. These preliminary results indicate that certain actions may be associated with the final stages of a search. Searchers seem to be more engaged in page content a nd in revisiting and assessing the pages they have already found, pe rhaps as a means of determining if they have enough information, i.e. if the Satiation stopping rule is met. They also seem to spend considerable time viewing additional results pages, perhaps as a means of assessing the costs and benefits of continuing to search. Further analysis and significance testing is required to confirm these findings. However, they prompt a number of interesting questions for further exploration. Are differe nt stopping behaviours associated with successful and unsuccessful searches? To what extent are these patterns dependent upon i ndividual differences and/or search task types? Understanding and identifying patterns of stopping behaviour may enable futu re retrieval systems to  X  X now X  when a user is wrapping up a sear ch, and to provide them with appropriate support.
