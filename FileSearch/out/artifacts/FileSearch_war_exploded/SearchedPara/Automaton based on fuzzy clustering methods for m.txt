 1. Introduction
The fault identification systems are useful to find abnormal behavior of an industrial process and it is a tool that avoids accidents for the human operators and machine damages. More-over, these systems allow reducing the maintenance costs of industrial process. Usually, the human operator knows the normal behavior of the industrial process and can identify several failure situations in a multivariable analysis of data ( Isermann, 2006 ). Supervision systems have five important elements: Situation assessment , where the process behavior is analyzed.
Detection of abnormal situations , to identify the possible failures.
 Diagnosis , which allows finding the origin of the faults.
Decision , where the human operator makes decisions regard-ing the process.

Reconfiguration, to carry out the corrective action of the process.
 known, the supervision system can identify the abnormal situa-tions. However, in a complex industrial process, sometimes the completed model is unknown ( Kempowsky, 2004 ). One alterna-tive to establish a functional states model based on historical data analysis is to use fuzzy clustering methods. Fuzzy clustering methods have been used with good results in supervision and diagnosis of processes ( Henriques et al., 1999 ; Ahvenlampi and Kortela, 2005 ; Zio et al., 2008 ; Quevedo et al., 2010 ; Jyoti and
Singh, 2011 ; Hu et al., 2012 ). The advantage of these methods is that they allow finding classes that can be associated to functional states (these states describe the process behavior including the abnormal situations) ( Lamrini et al., 2005 ). These classes are determined through the similar characteristics between historical data. Afterwards, when the process is online, recognition is carried out in order to identify the membership degree to each class or functional state. Recognition not only allows knowing the functional state of process but also the belonging to other states, which it is useful to avoid critical faults ( Gentil, 2007 ). connections among states can be established. The set of func-tional states and their connections determine a fuzzy automaton applied to task of prediction, for example, to know the new changes of the process behavior. This advantage allows carrying out decision-making, in such a way that the human operator knows the next functional state of process. By definition, a fuzzy automaton is a set of initial, internal and final states ( Klir and
Yuan, 1995 ). There exist two types of automata, the deterministic fuzzy automaton which generates a connection from an initial state to a final state, and the non-deterministic fuzzy automaton that establishes connections from an initial state to all final states ( Omlin et al., 1998 ). Fuzzy automata have been constructed through fuzzy rule-based inference, considering the knowledge of the system ( Chang and Chen, 2011 ). Nevertheless, there are no methods to construct and update a fuzzy automaton through fuzzy clustering. We focus our attention is to find a fuzzy automaton considering the membership degree matrix obtained by any fuzzy clustering method.

In industrial process applications, the connections among functional states are an important aspect to obtain an automaton.
Waissman et al. (2000) established connections among states known by the human operator. This method constructs the automaton considering the classification result according to the number of samples belonging to a class ( Waissman et al., 2005 ). Another method, using finite state machine was proposed by
Kempowsky et al. (2006) . This approach defined transition and frequency matrices according to the changes among classes obtained by the classification of historical data. Both methods provide an automaton based on the sequences of changes between functional states through fuzzy classification. Moreover, the methods are based on the expert knowledge to identify the transitions between states. It is important to take into account that the human operator knows the process performance, the observed functional states and their connections in the historical data. However, other transitions of the functional states of the process may appear but do not occur in the historical data.
One alternative is using the membership degrees obtained with a fuzzy clustering method, to calculate the transition degrees matrix of all connections among functional states and to update them afterwards. The result is a matrix where the strongest connections (or transitions) are considered to build up the auto-maton. In this paper, a method to establish automatically the connections is presented, through the membership degrees of the historical data whose classes are represented by the functional states. This method can be applied for any fuzzy clustering method and it is not necessary the expert knowledge to identify the state transitions. The connections are shown by a transition matrix that allows constructing a fuzzy automaton. To determine the transition matrix, the fuzzy states machine theory ( Reyneri, 1997 ; Mordeson and Malik, 2002 ) will be used to define a mathematical model of the connections among functional states. By means of this matrix, the proposed method considers all connections among functional states present, or not, in the historical data. On the other hand, to find the strongest connections, Hebbian functions ( Bishop, 2006 ) and the self-organizing map algorithm ( Kohonen, 1995 ) is used to propose an updated method of the transition matrix. In this step, a mathematical model is defined to update connections and to establish which they could be the most representative by the human operator X  X  criterion of process. Moreover, two distance functions are proposed in order to guarantee and find the strongest connections in the update step of transition matrix.

To apply the proposed method, the historical data of the process must be obtained offline. When the fuzzy clustering method is used, the obtained classes are associated with the functional states (normal and abnormal) of the process. Once the functional states are known, our proposal only uses the member-ship degree matrix ( N samples K classes or functional states) to find the connections among functional states. Initially, the method finds all connections among states. Nevertheless, an update step is defined to find the strongest connections due to not all them represent the behavior of a given industrial process. This step allows constructing a fuzzy automaton with the current connections in the historical data and some new connections. Finally, fuzzy automaton is verified by the human operator who valid the new connections useful to predict new possible situa-tions of the complex industrial process behavior.

In order to verify the independency of our proposal to the clustering method used to obtain the membership degrees of historical data. Three fuzzy clustering methods, LAMDA ( Piera et al., 1989 ), FCM ( Bezdek, 1981 ) and GK-means ( Gustafson and Kessel, 1979 ) were applied to obtain the classes associated with functional states. The objective is to observe that the same connec-tions among functional states are established by using different fuzzy clustering methods. The proposed method was used to find a fuzzy automaton in a boiler steam generator subsystem (the characteristics of this process are described in Section 5 ).
The structure of paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 , the fuzzy state machines theory and the Hebbian learning are presented. In Section 3 , we explain the general theory of the fuzzy clustering and discuss the proposed method with the distance criterion of similarity among classes for obtaining and updating the transition degrees matrix. In Section 4 , a new distance criterion for the updating step is explained. In Section 5 , the test results are presented. The method was tested on a steam generator system. The results obtained with the two distance criteria used are shown. Finally, in Section 6 some conclusions and future works are mentioned. 2. Fuzzy state machine and Hebbian learning
A Fuzzy State Machine (F m MS) is a representation of a set of initial and final states with their respective transitions associated with membership degrees. The first mathematical model was proposed by Wee and Fu (1969) . The connections among states are represented in a transition matrix. Considering a Fuzzy Automaton with finite states, it is represented by the six-tuple M  X  { S , Q , R , Z , d , o }, where: S is the alphabet set.
 Q is the set of states.
 R is the initial state fuzzy automaton ( R A Q ).

Z is the finite output alphabet. d : S Q [0,1] -Q is the fuzzy transitions map. o : Q -Z is the output transitions map.
 into account, where L is the language that the automaton interprets. Nevertheless, the transition between two states will be defined by a weight y a,b -[0,1], where a and b are respectively the indices of the initial and final states ( Omlin et al., 1999 ). Each transition, q with an input r and weight y a,b will be defined as r / y
The proposed method for automatic connections among func-tional states will consider the subsets S , Q and d . The graph of connections is static and constant in time, since the classification is carried out with the samples of historical signals. Using these concepts, the transition matrix D represents all connections among states, as shown in the following equation: D  X 
In Section 3.2 , a new representation of the transition matrix similar to Eq. (1) is proposed. Hebbian learning is a mathematical function used to update the weights of an Artificial Neural
Network. The following equation shows the Hebbian function where w n,m is a function to update weights ( Bishop, 2006 ): w
The term Z is the number of the current iteration, x n is the n -th input to the network, y m is the m -th network output and e is the learning parameter.

The Fuzzy State Machine (F m MS) theory will be applied to establish the initial and final connections with all classes asso-ciated with functional states, using the classification obtained by any fuzzy clustering method. Hebbian functions will be imple-mented to remove the weaker connections and to validate the strongest ones. These functions allow updating the transi-tion matrix. The self-organizing map algorithm will be used to find the best transition matrix. The final fuzzy automaton will be analyzed by the human operator who determines the coherence of each transition. The proposed method relies on three steps: obtain the initial transition matrix, update and construct the final transition matrix; these steps are explained in the following section. 3. Fuzzy automaton based on membership degrees matrix
The result of any fuzzy clustering method is a membership degree matrix (see Eq. (3) ) which assigns the membership degrees of each sample to each class (the classes are associated to functional states of the process). Our proposal only uses this matrix to calculate the transition degrees matrix. Then, it is possible to use any fuzzy clustering method. In Section 5 , the independence of our proposal to the fuzzy clustering method is tested.

By means of the membership degrees matrix, the initial transition degrees matrix is constructed. All possible connections among functional states are considered. Since not all connections can occur, an update of the transition degrees matrix is required.
This step is crucial because it depends on a set of parameters to obtain the best convergence of the transition matrix (the recom-mended parameter values are shown in Section 3.3 ). The result is a final transition degrees matrix that considers the strongest connections. Using the transition matrix, the fuzzy automaton (or graph of connections) is constructed by observing the transitions from the initial functional state to the final functional state. The final fuzzy automaton must be verified by the human operator who analyses the physical sense of each transition. Fig. 1 illus-trates the general scheme of the proposed method. 3.1. Fuzzy clustering
Clustering methods attempt to find natural groups of data, according to the similarities among the samples. Each vector x process. Typically the  X  X  X imilarity X  X  concept is defined as the distance between a data vector ( x i ) and the cluster prototype (center). The characteristics of the prototypes are not usually known beforehand; they are chosen randomly and updated at the same time as the partitioning of the data is made. In crisp clustering, when a data partition is build, a single sample ( x ) belongs to only one cluster. The fuzzy clustering extends this notion to express the membership degree of an observation (vector x i ) to all classes. Fuzzy clustering methods estimate the membership degree (or adequacy), m i,j -[0,1] of each data point i to a cluster (or class) j . The classification result of these methods is the membership matrix , U . The following equation defines this matrix for N samples and K classes.

U  X  fuzzy membership matrix is used to estimate the transition matrix for the automaton. Then, it is possible to use any fuzzy clustering method. In the case of study ( Section 5 ), three fuzzy clustering algorithms were tested to obtain the U matrices: The
Fuzzy C-means, the Gustafson and Kessel means and the LAMDA method.
 improved by Bezdek (1981) , is a fuzzy extension of the K -means.
This well-known fuzzy clustering method is based on an iterative optimization of an objective function (e.g. variability within clusters). For this algorithm, the similarity measure is the Eucli-dian distance. The algorithm is based on minimized the distance between data points and clusters centers. The Gustafson and Kessel
Means algorithm (GK-means) ( Gustafson and Kessel, 1979 )isan extension of the FCM method. This algorithm replaces the
Euclidean distance by a cluster-specific Mahalanobis distance, so as to adapt to various sizes and forms of the clusters. ( Aguilar-Mart X   X  n and Lo  X  pez de Mantaras, 1982 ), is a fuzzy meth-odology of conceptual clustering and classification. It was used to several diagnosis systems applications ( Hedjazi et al., 2010 ; Isaza et al., 2009 ; Aguilar-Martin et al., 2007b ; Kempowsky et al., 2006 ;
Waissman et al., 2000 ). This methodology is based on finding the global membership degree of an individual to an existing class, considering all the contributions of its attributes ( D variables). This contribution is called the Marginal Adequacy Degree (MAD).
The MADs are combined using  X  X  X uzzy mixed connectives X  X  as aggregation operators in order to obtain the Global Adequacy Degree (GAD) of an element to a class ( Aguilar-Mart X   X  n, 2007a ).
The GAD is the membership degree of data to classes. This method does not require the number of clusters as an initial parameter. An automatic threshold is used to avoid the assign-ment of a not very representative observation to any class. This threshold corresponds to the GAD to the Non-Informative Class (NIC). Therefore, if the maximum GAD value of an observation ( x is fewer than the NIC threshold, a new class is generated. The
LAMDA method allows working with multiple variables, corre-sponding with both numerical information and qualitative infor-mation ( Piera et al., 1989 ). 3.2. Obtaining the initial transition degrees matrix
To use the proposed method, the historical data must be normalized to apply the fuzzy clustering. Using the membership degrees matrix obtained (see Eq. (3) ), The maximum membership degree (Eq. (4) ), m max i,j , is calculated for each sample i associated with a class j , being j -[1, y , K ].
Eq. (4) allows finding the average of the maximum member-class j . m p  X 
N j is the number of samples with m max i,j in class j . Eq. (5) defines the value of the center of each class j that represents a set of m max i,j and it is used to obtain the transition matrix. Hence, all m p will be grouped in a matrix UP or the following equation that associates each m p j with each class K j :

The fuzzy state machine theory is used to construct a fuzzy automaton. The idea is to take into account all connections among functional states applied by a non-deterministic fuzzy state machine. This consideration takes into account the fact that the human operator may ignore the existence of transitions which do not appear in the historical data. Reyneri (1997) defined the active fuzzy state between an initial state S a and a final state S approach considers the connections from a state S a to all states S being a a b . The objective of this step is to find the transition degree m ( t ) ranging from states a -b and b -a . To calculate m ( t ship degrees of the active fuzzy states. Alvim and de Oliviera Cruz, 2008 demonstrated the relation between m  X ( S b )and m ( S ing m ( t a,b ), where for 8 a ,1 r a r K and 8 b ,1 r b r K . m 0 S  X  X  X  m t a , b m S a  X  X  X  7  X  Each m ( S a ) is associated with any fixed state m p j (initial state).
On the other hand, m  X  ( S b ) is related with a variable state m p states), for 8 j ,1 r j r K . By using Eq. (7) , m ( t a,b the ratio between m  X  ( S b ) and m ( S a ). m t a , b  X  m 0 S b  X  X  = m S a  X  X  X  8  X 
There are cases in Eq. (8) where m ( t a,b ) 4 1. Hence, it is important to normalize each m ( t a,b ) to guarantee m ( t following equation defines the normalization function, indicated by the term m t a , b , where it must be considered sub-index a as a fixed initial state and sub-index b as a final state that changes between 1 and K .
It may happen that m ( t a,b )  X  1, i.e. when the membership degrees S a  X  S b . This case will not be considered for constructing the graph of connections. The proposed method will only take into account the transitions from an initial state to final state. By applying Eq. (9) , two constraints are fulfilled: The sum of m ( t a,b ) on all b is equal to 1 ( Demasi, 2003 ).
The ratio between the sum of the membership degrees of the final states m  X  ( S b ), if b a a , and the sum of the m t the membership degree of the initial state m ( S a ). This condition is expressed by the following equation.  X  X  X 
By means of Eqs. (8) and (9) , the transition degrees matrix UT is constructed, where all connections among functional states are considered. This case is observed in the following equation: UT  X  3.3. Updating step for the transition matrix
Not all connections among functional states represent the behavior of a given industrial process. Therefore, an update of Eq. (12) is required. The main idea is to find the transitions that may be present in the process. This step is based on the construction of the Hebbian functions and on the self-organizing map algorithm. The final result is a transition matrix with the strongest connections for building the fuzzy automaton. The update of the weights, within the self-organizing map algorithm, is usually carried out by a distance criterion (frequently the Euclidian distance). This distance relates the input data with respect to the current weight. Hence, the minimum distance represents the winning neuron or the nearest neuron from the input data ( Palma Me  X  ndez and Mar X   X  n Morales, 2008 ). By using the same criterion, a minimum distance function for each class, G defined: G  X  min d * U  X  X  X  13  X  where d n ( ) is an arbitrary distance function. Since all informa-tion is represented by the membership degrees, a distance criterion based on fuzzy quantity is needed. Isaza (2007) pro-posed an ultrametric distance measure between fuzzy classes a and b , given by the following equation:
The term N refers to the total number of samples in matrix U (see Eq. (3) ), and: d * a , b  X  X  X  1
The intersection between two fuzzy sets m i,a and m i,b for each sample i , is:
The union between two fuzzy sets m i,a and m i,b for each sample i , is:
By using the self-organizing map algorithm, a Gaussian func-tion, h a,b ( Z ), is applied ( Kohonen, 1990 ). h The term Z is the current iteration number of the algorithm. Eq. (17) is used to obtain a good convergence during the updating.
Initially, the standard deviation, s a , b ( Z ), is initialized with a random value and by increasing Z , it is updated. Eq. (18) defines a Hebbian function in order to update s a , b ( Z  X  1), ( Haykin, 2008 ):
The term m is the size of the matrix UT ( K K dimensions or m  X  K 2 ) and e o ( Z ) represents the learning parameter, as shown in
Eq. (19) :  X 
The terms e in and e f are the initial and final learning parameters, respectively. Haykin (2008) recommended to use e in  X  0.01 and  X  0.1 in order to obtain the best convergence. The term G / m ( s a,b ( Z )) 2 o 1, the value of s a , b ( Z  X  1) decreases and h Hence, the convergence of the algorithm depends on the value of
G . To update the transition matrix of Eq. (12) ,a function to update the function that allows finding the strongest connections.
The term e t ( Z ) represents a learning factor for updating  X  where Z f is the maximum number of iterations. The method compares the value of m t a , b  X  Z  X  1  X  and m t a , b  X  important connections (see Fig. 2 ). In this case, the updating can present two cases: is considered weaker.
 is considered stronger.

The transition matrix of Eq. (12) is updated for each iteration Z and it stops if: 9
UT Z  X  1 UT  X  Z  X  9 d  X  22  X  where d is the stopping criterion for updating the matrix. The UT matrix keeps the constraints described in Eqs. (10) and (11) . Fig. 2 is presented the different steps to obtain and update the transition matrix. 3.4. Construction of the fuzzy automaton of connections among classes) is constructed by using the final transition degrees matrix . The strategy consists on observing the output transitions from an initial functional state in relation to the others. Any transition different from 0 will be considered. The graph represents a fuzzy automaton that illustrates the changes of the behavior of a complex industrial process (see Fig. 3 ). 4. A new distance criterion for the updating step fuzzy automaton, it was stated from both application examples that some current transitions in the historical data were removed and some new connections unlikely to happen, according to the human operator. This situation may be present by low transition degrees and the choice of the distance criterion (see Eq. (14) ).Thechoiceofthe distance function is critical to find a reliable fuzzy automaton for the human operator. Therefore, a new distance criterion is required in order to define the transitions in the historical data and to validate new transitions through the human operator X  X  experience. The new distance criterion is based on the distance function explained in
Eq. (14) , but the dispersion of the samples in each class j is also considered. Hence, this criterion takes into account the volume of the class. The following equation represents the variance, x j samples i with respect to a class j : x  X  where N is the number of samples in class j and me j is the mean value of the membership degrees of each class j . To include the dispersion of samples of each class j inthedistancecriterionexplainedin Eq. (14) , it is assumed that multiplying a fuzzy set A by a constant, H where the characteristics of the fuzz y set are preserved. The following equation shows a representation of the above explanation: H  X  kte A  X  24  X  where kte is a constant between 0 and 1. Eq. (24) shows that H be considered as a fuzzy set. Taking into account that x j between 0 and 1, it is possible to multiply the dispersion of a class j by its membership degree, as shown in the following equation: where p i,j is the multiplication between the variance of each class j and the membership degree of sample i . Through Eq. (14) and by considering the variance of each class (see Eq. (23) ), a new distance criterion is proposed, dn ( a , b ), between two fuzzy sets a and b ,as showninthefollowingequation:: dn a , b  X  X  X  1 properties of symmetry, separation of fuzzy sets and triangular inequality demonstrated by Isaza (2007) . Moreover, Eq. (26) considers the volume of each class represented by its variance.

In the next section, the comparison of the results for the is developed.
 5. Case of study
The method is applied in a Steam Generator process. To establish if a new connection found with the proposed method is likely presented or not, the description of classes or functional states (include the physical variable behavior) and the human operator X  X  knowledge are available. By means of this information, the new connections among functional states are validated by the human operator and/or by test data. On the other hand, to analyze the independence of the proposed method with respect to the fuzzy clustering technique, our method was applied tree times using, at each time, a different fuzzy clustering method. The
LAMDA , FCM and GK-means were used. The best classification (for each clustering method) is considered to use the proposed method. Application of the proposed method is below shown.
Each time, by using the membership degrees matrices, the fuzzy state machine theory is applied to calculate the initial transition degrees matrices. These matrices contain every connection among functional states, and then an update of them is required. By implementing the Hebbian functions and part of the self-organizing map algorithm, the final transition degrees matrices are found. In this step, the parameters explained in Section 3.3 are used to find the best convergence of these matrices. The conver-gence is found when the transition degrees matrix does not change during Z iterations. It is recommended that the convergence be achieved before Z f or a maximum number of iterations fixed by the user. Finally, the fuzzy automaton or graph of connections is constructed based on the final transition degrees matrix. The main characteristic of this automaton is that it is determined through the historical data information only. The resulting auto-maton is tested afterwards with new data with connections not present in the historical data. It is important to take into account that the two distance functions are used in the updating step (see
Eqs. (14) and (26) ). In this case, the objective is to compare the connections found in the automata with the two distance criteria.
This strategy will allow selecting the best distance function to find real connections among functional states.
 historical data information. The automaton is validated with a set of data and the experience of a human operator. The steam generator process was designed as a pilot scale version for a real steam generator for a nuclear central. The same process was used to validate the approach of matrices of connections presented by
Kempowsky et al. (2006) . The process operation begins when the feed water flow is generated by a pump that propels water into a boiler. To maintain a constant water level in the boiler, an On X  X ff controller operates via the pump. Hence, the boiler heat power value will depend on the steam accumulator pressure. When the accumulator pressure drops below a minimum value, the heat resistance is activated to give the maximum heat 9 power. When a maximum pressure is achieved, the heat resistance is cut off to maintain the pressure in 7 0.2 bar as the set-point. The resulting steam flow is measured by a flow sensor. The functional states analyzed by the human operator correspond to: normal operation level and pressure regulation ( C 5). The historical data of the process has 937 samples and 5 descriptors or physical variables, water feed output steam flow ( F 10) (see Fig. 4 ). In Fig. 5 , the five physical variables (or descriptors) are shown. The variables are normalized according to the maximum and minimum value for each variable in order to homogenize the order of magnitude of the variables. the test data. By applying the LAMDA, FCM and GK-means methods, the three matrices U were found by using the historical data. The membership degrees obtained with these methods are normalized, m n i,j , before applying the proposed method, as shown in the following equation: where m min j and m max j is the minimum and maximum member-ship degrees of the class j . Fig. 6 shows the representation of the membership degrees by using the LAMDA method, where the x axis is the sample and the y axis represents the membership degree associated with each sample. The clustering method parameters, for which a good convergence is obtained, are shown in Tables 1 and 2 .
The classification results correspond to those associated by the human operator by using the LAMDA method (see Fig. 7 ). With the FCM method an error of 0.11% (one sample) was obtained and with the GK-means method an error of 0.54% (five samples).
Nevertheless, these results are sufficient to construct the graph of connections.

By applying the proposed method, using the distance criterion ( d * ( a,b )) in Eq. (14) , the convergence of the transition degrees matrices was achieved with Z  X  6, and the learning parameters applied were: d  X  10 20 and Z f  X  50. Considering the distance dn(a,b) Eq. (25) , the convergence was achieved with Z  X  3 and the learning parameters applied were: d  X  10 22 and Z f  X  20. On the other hand, it is important to take into account that the values of e in and e f are the same shown in Section 3.3 .

In this application, the independence with respect to the used fuzzy clustering method was achieved because the same initial transition degrees matrix is found. Table 3 shows the matrices UT for the two distance criteria. In this case, it can be observed that the three transition degrees matrices are the same for each distance criterion. The last results demonstrate the independence of the proposed method when different fuzzy clustering methods are applied. Fig. 8 a illustrates the graph of connections with the transitions matrices proposed by Kempowsky (2004) for the same industrial process. In this case, the method finds transitions in the historical data (see Fig. 9 a, black line) and by applying the data validation and the human operator criterion, it was determined that connection (C2) -(C5) must be added (see Fig. 9 a, black dotted). Figs. 8 b and c illustrate the graphs of connections obtained with Eqs. (14) and (26) , respectively. In both cases, the proposed method determined and validated the majority of connections in the historical data. Moreover, the method finds new connections not present in the historical data (see Fig. 8 b and c, dotted line). Comparing Fig. 8 a, b and c, by considering the distance criterion of Eq. (26) , connections (C5) -(C2) and (C2) (C5) are found and connection (C5) -(C4) is removed. This result is very close to the concept of the human operator and describes the real behavior of the process. The new connections obtained with the distance criterion dn(a,b) are explained below:
Connections ( C 2) -( C 5) and ( C 3) -( C 5): In the classification with historical data (see Fig. 5 ), connections ( C 2) -( C 5) and ( C 3) -( C 5) are not present in the data. With the proposed method, connections ( C 2) -( C 5) and ( C 3) -( C 5) are identified which demonstrates that these transitions occur in the process (see Figs. 9, 10 and 11 ). Physically speaking, these connections may occur when during pressure regulation ( C 2or C 3), the water level drops in L8 and pump P1 is activated (F3) to regulate to the level in the boiler this makes the temperature to drop an in consequence Q4 will not be cutoff until the pressure ( P 7) reaches the set point (this correspond to C 5).
Connection ( C 1) -( C 5): In a normal state (C1) a critical state may occur if the water level drops to a minimum and at the same time as the pressure drops and therefore the resistance and the water flow are activated simultaneously ( C 5) for a short period of time.
 applications, for instance, chemical process, weather treatment plant, nuclear plant, among others. The historical data of process must represent the most important process behavior, and the physical variable must be independent between them. Moreover, the human operator X  X  experience is significantly considered in order to define the description of each functional state and to validate the new connections. 6. Conclusion industrial processes was proposed, based on the membership degrees matrix. This method is useful for supervision systems, it can be considered as a tool to identify abnormal states in complex processes. By means of the application of any fuzzy clustering technique, the proposed method allows constructing a fuzzy automaton in order to find new connections (none included in the historical or learning data) among functional states. To obtain the automaton, the method represents the connections using transition degrees matrix. By applying the Hebbian functions, the strongest connections are found. The method finds the current connections in the historical data and some new connections.
These new transitions suggest that those new connections may occur and must be considered in the decision-making process.
The final result is a graph of connections for the functional states that predicts the changes in the process behavior. One of the advantages of the proposed method is its independence regarding the fuzzy clustering method because it is always possible to find the same graph of connections. By implementing and comparing two distance criteria, the new proposed distance does not remove transitions in the historical data. In the case of study, the selected parameters allow the human operator to find a validated auto-maton. Moreover, the proposed method can identify transitions not present in the historical data but likely to occur. It is recommended to apply to the proposed method the best classi-fication obtained with any fuzzy clustering method. The valida-tion of the transitions must be supported by the human operator.
Future studies will propose a different method for finding a new automaton by using, for example, the Fuzzy Bayesian Networks and the Fuzzy Cellular Automata, which will not depend on parameters and will predict the process behavior in dynamic systems.
