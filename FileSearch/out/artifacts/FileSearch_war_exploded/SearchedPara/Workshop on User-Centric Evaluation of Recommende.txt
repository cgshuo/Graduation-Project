In his keynote speech at the 2009 Recommender Systems conference, Francisco Martin indicated that the main challenge in recommender system industry is not to discover algorithms that provide good recommendations, but to provide users with a usable and intuitive interface for presen ting these recommendations and eliciting feedback [1]. Several re searchers have argued that other factors that may influence the user experience have not received the amount of attention they deserve [2][3][4]. Unfortunately, the research on  X  X uman-Recommender Interaction X  is scarce. While algorithm optimization and off-lin e testing using measures like RMSE are standard procedure in the recommender systems community, theorizing about consumer decision processes and measuring user experience in online tests is much less common. have been investigating consumer choice processes in great detail, but only sparingly put this knowledge to use in technological applications. Likewise, the field of Human-Computer Interaction has been studying the usability of interfaces for ages, but does not seem to connect the dots between research on consumer choice, and recommender system interfaces. Systems and Their Interfaces (UCERSTI) tries to bridge the gaps between these fields by providing a platform for Human-Recommender Interaction research.
