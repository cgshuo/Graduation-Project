 There has been a growing interest within the CSCW community to understand how actors in orga nizations collaboratively seek information. This focus had led to the emergence of the research area of collaborative information seeking (CIS). Despite an increasing number of conceptual as well as technical studies related to CIS, many fundame ntal questions still remain unanswered. For example, researchers within this space have argued that CIS goes beyond two or more individuals posing  X  X uestion and answers X  to each other in their attempt to seek the needed information. If CIS is not just about  X  X uestion and answers X , then what does it exac tly constitute? We propose that one way to answer these questions is to conceptualize CIS as being constituted through, and or chestrated via,  X  X arratives X . In this research note, we elaborat e upon the notion of  X  X arratives X , and talk about the potential useful ness of such a conceptualization for furthering CIS research and advancing CSCW scholarship. H.3.3 [ Information storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  search process. Collaborative work, Collaborative Information Seeking, CIS, Narratives, Theory. Modern organizations are becomi ng more collaborative [8, 14]. With the increasing level of interdependence among actors, activities, and artifacts [9, 20], the lines between individual and collaborative tasks are becoming blurrier. Furthermore, organizations are becoming informa tion-intensive, but at the same time, information is becoming more and more fragmented and distributed across multiple actors, artifacts, and systems [15]. Consequently, collaborative in formation seeking (CIS) has become an increasingly important part of organizational work [27]. Over the past decade, it has also emerged as a distinct stream of research within CSCW [7, 8, 14-16, 18]. CIS can be defined as the activity in which  X  X wo or more individuals work together to seek needed information in order to satisfy a goal X . It may involve a variety of systems, people, and channels in order to address the information need for the task-at-hand. CIS researchers have conduc ted a number of conceptual as well as technical studies in trying to explicate what the concept really mean, the triggers and activities that underlie the concept, [8, 14-16], and how these, in turn, could inform the design of information retrieval (IR) systems [7, 18]. In spite of a growing number of conceptual and technical studies concerning CIS, fundamental ques tions still remain unanswered. For example, researchers have argued that CIS is not just about two or more people posing questions and answers to each other in their attempt to look for specific information [15]. Instead, they have posited that CIS is much more complex  X  involving the ongoing interweavement of actors, artifacts and activities  X  than the simple process of questions and answers [8, 14, 16]. If CIS is not just about  X  X &amp;A X , what does it exactly constitute? What are the underlying mechanisms and pr actices that unde rscore CIS? We propose an analytical lens fo r investigating these issues. We argue that CIS is constituted through and orchestrated via narratives . Understanding how these narratives are created, shared and put to use in  X  X eal time X  would, in turn, help us uncover the fundamental mechanisms that drives CIS. In this research note, we firs t elaborate upon our perspective concerning the role played by narratives in constituting and orchestrating CIS. We then de monstrate the utility of our perspective by providing illustrative examples from field studies of collaborative work that we have conducted in the past. We conclude by discussing the implications of the  X  X arratives X  perspective for CIS research. Often, the terms  X  X arrative X  and  X  X tory X  are used interchangeably. Though they have many commonalit ies (for e.g. chronological  X ... instantiations, particular exemplars, of the grand conception  X  [5] which respond to the question:  X  X nd then what happened? X  X  Narratives, on the other hand, focus on that grand conception itself by implicitly dealing with que stions such as  X  X hat is it all about? X  or  X  X hat does all of this mean? X  X 5] In this sense, stories are only a subset of a narrative. Narratives could be thought of as descriptions that provide  X  X  holistic account of a set of events and contain a mixture of beliefs, intentions, actions, and contextual details that are temporally ordered, and have an implied  X  X lot X  that connects them in terms of causality  X  (p.327) [1] In simple terms, narratives are  X  X et of events and the contextual details surrounding their occurrence X  (p.108) [2] that is meaningfully synthesized by a plot . This plot temporally orders the set of interrelated incidents into the past, the present and the future, and places them within a larger socio-historic context. This temporal ordering, however, is not a mere act of sequencing [4, 17]. Rath er, it shows how humans actually go about doing things in the world, and how they make sense of the world [1, 2]. A functional event is said to be the building block of a narrative [13]. A functional event consists of  X  X wo actants connected by some action, so they are similar in structure to a simple sentence:  X  X  X ubject X  X erb X  X bject. X  [13]. For example, statements such as  X  X  click on the  X  X irstNetED X  icon to get to the patient record quickly X  or  X  X  text John Smith from the DB support team whenever I face any connectivity issues X  could be considered as functional events. A collection of such functional events [13] that are ordered temporally in the form of stories lead to what we call as a  X  X arrative X . Most social information in our everyday life is transmitted in the form of narratives. Indeed, resear ch within organizational studies suggests how most of our organizational realities are transmitted via narratives [20]. These studi es have shown how narratives provide a way for people to sh are their occupational knowledge with one another [3, 17] and create a common ground for promoting coordinated action [2, 9] . Information is said to have encoded in human memory as narratives, and consequently, people have a natural predisposition to record, share, and retrieve information in the form of narratives [6]. Why is this important for CIS re search, specifically, and CSCW generally? First, as Weick [20] has argued, narratives enable and empower organizational actors with powerful means for making sense of their everyday work contexts. They provide a mechanism for people to share contextual info rmation with one another [4, 9, 11] that could otherwise not be shared in the form of abstract propositions. Since people who bel ong to different professions within an organization neither have the common vocabulary to facilitate easier communication and information sharing, nor the shared mental models to promote common ground and understanding, it becomes extremel y difficult for information to be sought, understood, interp reted and disseminated across disparate epistemic boundaries. Ho wever, through the usage of plots, narratives offers a  X  X oint of view X  of an actor towards handling a specific event or a situa tion [1]. This point of view, as illustred by Orr [11] and Bobrow and Whalen [3] in their respective studies, goes beyond being mere descriptions of the situation to becoming active reenactments of the situation [20]. That is, this plot help the seeker of information to see and visualize (in the present) how that event (of the past) unfolded in real-time, and how it could in turn be used to address information needs and demands (of the future ). These, in turn, helps information to be sought and shared across different occupational boundaries. This simultaneous explica tion of the past, present, and the future provides narratives with the generative power that neither the simple information-seeking and sharing workflows nor the formalized business rules used by IR systems offer. Narratives, in other words, help actors to actively structure their temporality. It shapes the attention in the present by evoking memories of the past and expectations of the future [17]. Second, if we could think of ac tors as having a predisposition to store and categorize information in memory in the form of narratives, then narratives do indeed become the mechanism through which they also seek and sh are this information. In other words, people not just seek information using the help of narratives; instead, the very act of information seeking happens through narratives. In short, narrati ves become the platform through which CIS is orchestrated . Through narratives, actors not only continually throw question and answers at each other but also contextualize, de-contextualize and re-contextualize the situation in order to attend to the task-in-hand [9]. In doing so, they evoke past memories and experiences, contrast it with the current situation in order to find out how similar or different those situations are from the current situation, and take the needed action to resolve the information needs of that situation. That is, narratives not only reflect but also enact the patterns of actions and interactions that unfold among actors, artifacts and activities within an organization. This duality of narratives to prom ote sensemaking as well as to generate action [2, 4] enables an d empowers actors-on-the-ground to not only make sense of the probl em or the situation but also to instigate appropriate actions in order to seek the needed information. This conceptualiz ation would let us capture and understand how things actually  X  X  et done X  within organizations. All of these would indeed help us understand what goes constitutes CIS beyond just Q&amp;A. Third, when actors evoke a narrative, it automatically and simultaneously implicates  X  X he physical artifacts (e.g., equipment, databases and documents), work processes (e.g., analytic techniques and standard operating procedures), and people (e.g., expertise, power and political clout) X  [2] that are involved in a past situation. In other words, narratives not only tell us which people to talk to or what tools to use while seeking a particular information but also about how to contact those people and how to use and appropriate those tools [ 13]. Since tools, technologies, and artifacts are part and parcel of CIS, these narratives could be potentially very useful for acto rs on the field to address the information needs of the specific situation. By focusing on narratives, researchers could understand the mechanisms that underlie CIS i.e. what constitutes CIS, how CIS is orchestrated, the tools and tec hnologies it implicates and more. Also, since narratives play a dual function in being a device for sensemaking and a vehicle for generating action, adopting a  X  X arratives X  perspective could let CSCW researchers embrace (and in some ways, even transcend) both the  X  X ognitivist X  and the  X  X nteractional X  perspectives for the study of collaborative socio-technical work. We now illustrate the utility of our  X  X arratives X  perspective using examples from two field studies in the healthcare domain that we had conducted in the past [12, 19]. Consider vignette A given below (See Table 1) that portrays an episode of CIS within a multidisciplinary patient care team in a hospital emergency department [12] . From this vignette, we could see how information is collabor atively sought, interpreted, and made sense of via a trajectory of narratives. It starts with the registration associate X  X  narrative about how she feels sorry for the patient in room 20 who is 8-weeks pregnant and was hit by a car. This information was made into a narrative by charge nurse 1. CN1 constructed that narrative through infusing the information (that the RA gave) with meaning (i.e. if adequate action is not taken, it would result in the death of the baby). This was done through building upon her past experiences and memories, which was then shared with the charge nurse 2. It is important to note that these past memories and experiences themselves are not  X  X erely X  transferred as-is to anot her person (i.e. charge nurse 2) as abstract data points in a propositional form. Rather, they were packaged and shared via narratives. For instance, when the CN1 remembers the case of a former patient who was  X 7 months pregnant when brought to the emergency department and the baby had been lost because no one realized that the patient was pregnant X , she is not just transf erring some past information to CN2. Neither is she providing an answer to a question that was posed. Instead, she is evoking a narrative of the past through weaving a plot that then gets re -contextualized and re-applied to the problem-at-hand by CN2 [20]. Through this plot, temporality is structured. Past, present, and future are re-ordered to cater to the problem-at-hand i.e. attention in the present is shaped by evoking memories of the past and expectations of the future [17]. Although some wrong information is passed in the process (i.e. 8 months instead of 8 weeks pregnant), this is not merely  X  X  case of miscommunication of informati on X  [12]. Instead, it is about making the meaning underlying the information more sticky and salient (i.e. death of the baby, cr iticality of the patient, need to take quick action etc.) 1:40pm : Registration associate (RA) tells me that she feels sorry for the patient in room 20 who is 8-weeks pregnant and was hit by a car. The next shift X  X  charge nurse (CN2), arrives and the current charge nurse (CN1) tell s CN2 information about each patient by going through FirstNet , a patient record system. CN1 tells CN2 that the patient in room 20 was hit by a car and is 8 months pregnant. CN1 remember s the case of a former patient who was 7 months pregnant when brought to the emergency department and the baby had been lost because no one realized that the patient was pregnant. 5:00pm: CN2 is talking to the attending physician (AP) about her patients. She specifically tells AP that she is worried that the patient in room 20 who is 8 months pregnant. AP (surprised):  X  X ow pregnant? X  CN2:  X 8 months. I X  X e been told baby is ok. X  AP is still concerned, so he and CN2 pull up the patient X  X  record in FirstNet and discuss various aspects of her case. They don X  X  verify the pregnancy information. They miss that the record says 8-weeks pregnant. They discuss how the patient should be treated given the advanced stage of pregnancy. In this way, collaborative info rmation seeking happens through a process of narrative co-construction, where the plot gets continually re-worked and re-con textualized by both the parties involved. The people engaged in th e information seeking act, thus, are not mere senders and receivers of information. Instead, they both are active co-constructors of the narrative. They use the narrative to make sense of the evol ving situation as well as to take action to cater to the problem-at-hand. (It is, however, important to note that the actions that are generated by narratives might not always lead to positive outcomes. Narratives structure the reality for organizational actors, renderi ng some information significant and other, non-significant. Hence, narratives should not be thought of as a form of panac ea for organizational actors to successfully complete their tasks). Consider another example of vi gnette B (see Table 2) from a different field study of an IT s upport team within a hospital [19]. Here, the IT support staffs are co llaboratively seeking information regarding issues about folder perm issions to a particular set of users. Unlike vignette A, it is not the narratives of the past that gets evoked, interpreted, re-contextualized, and put to use to cater that gets narrated. The ad-hoc team  X  X alks through X  the present about what permissions should and should not be given to users. They narrate the tacit theories and hypotheses that they believe in to each other. Each of the members of the ad-hoc team had partial information on how to resolve the issue. But it is through weaving an ongoing narrative that they were able to co llectively seek, synthesize and evaluate the needed information  X  X n-the-fly X . In this process, they were not only able to diagnose/make sense of what the problem was, but also were able to take the needed actions during the very proce ss of narrating that problem. Jim, a CSC representative, cannot resolve a client issue in the time allotted; therefore, he creates a HEAT ticket and assigns it to Richard on the Clinical Software Services team. Richard is able to determine the cause of the problem immediately. However, Richard does not have the knowledge to determine exactly how to resolve the issue. Therefore, Richard pulls together an ad-hoc team of experts to tackle the problem. Richard calls a meeting to discuss the problem. On his computer, Richard shows the team the current permissions settings for the scan folders. They talk through what permissions should and should not be given to users based on a previous system configuration. The team discusses if the scanning groups should be broken down more granularly. After the team members share their particular knowledge on the subj ect, Matt says,  X  X hy don X  X  we take the global group and give th em read/write/modify? I could have sworn modify allows for deleting of files. X  Richard suggests that they test Matt X  X  hypothesis. Richard edits the share permissions and then suggests that they do a preliminary test where Chris attempts to get access to the scan folder now that the  X  X veryone X  group has been removed from share permissions. Richard and Matt walk over to Ch ris X  X  desk to have him test his access. Chris X  X  access to the scan folder is denied. This proves that removing the  X  X veryone X  group from the share permissions seems to have worked. The meeting is adjourned. 
Table 2. Vignette B from a field study of IT support team Both these vignettes illustrate how narratives orchestrate as well as constitute CIS. Vignette A showed how narratives of the past are re-contextualized and re-applied to the problem-at-hand. Vignette B showed how the probl em-at-hand in itself could be constituted through narratives. In both these cases, narratives acted not only as a device for sens emaking, but also as a vehicle for generating action. Narratives enable us to capture and understand the interdependence between, technology and organization, on the one hand, and information and co llaboration, on the other. It enables us to see how actors, artifacts and activities are entangled with one another, and helps us to capture the complex interaction patterns that unfold at the nexus of technology, information, and collaboration [8, 11, 14]. In doi ng this, narratives have the potential to address a long-sta nding debate (conc erning processes and practices, plans and situated actions) that has been widely discussed within CSCW [11, 14 , 19] and Organizational studies [3, 13]. To elaborate, current business processes and technologies to support those processes are built on top of what is called as propositional knowledge [1, 2]. This knowledge is based on  X  X f-then X  rules (If situation X, on condition Y, do Z), deployed using  X  X equest-response X  systems that se quentially seek and retrieve information via database queries [14]. These propositions are, in turn, represented as business rules, visualized as workflow diagrams and formalized across the organization in the form of process charts and handbooks. A lthough these business processes could be useful in some situations , one problem with them is that they tend to simplify, abstract, or even ignore the actual  X  X ractices X  that underlie them [3]. Esse ntially, this problem could be said to occur due to the tension between simplicity and complexity, between parsimony and richness. Processes and workflows are simplified abstractions, while practices are complex elaborations. Repr esenting and formalizing processes into simplified workflows, on the one hand, could reduce the cognitive load of actors who only care about finishing the task-at-hand, but at the same time, it could also lead to other problems because important contextual and socio-historic information are lost. On the other hand, representing and elaborating practices , is extremely difficult a nd putting them to use is an arduous task. We posit narratives as mechanisms that could provide us the much needed middle-path between the  X  X rocess-centric X  and the  X  X ractice-centric X  viewpoints . People, when presented with narratives, will have the implic it ability to a) construct propositions from them, and, b) elaborate practices from them. However, we have very few mechanisms and systems in place that could store, categorize, retrieve narratives, and help actors in constructing, interpreting, and using them as a part and parcel of everyday work activities. Conseque ntly, organizations tend to lose these powerful narratives as soon as people quit th e organization. So far, the design of IR systems has only focused on how to codify, represent, formalize and implement  X  X ropositions X . Therefore, the research challenge for us is to not only understand how people construct, interpret, sensemake, and use narratives as a part and parcel of their everyday work [10], but also to explicate how these narratives act as the underlying platform for orchestration of CIS (as well as for other collaborative activities). The insights gained from these have the potential to advance not only the CIS research but also impact the broader CSCW research. This work was supported by funding from NSF grant #084497. 1.
