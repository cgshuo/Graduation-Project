 A parameterized family of non-linear, link analytic ranking func-tions is proposed that includes Pagerank as a special case and uses the convexity property of those functions to be more resistant to link spam attacks. A contribution of the paper is the construction of such a scheme with provable uniqueness and convergence guar-antees. The paper also demonstrates that even in an unlabelled sce-nario this family can have spam resistance comparable to Trustrank [3] that uses labels of spam or nat-spam on a training set. The pro-posed method can use labels, if available, to improve its perfor-mance to provide state of the art level of link spam protection.

To better understand the spam susceptibility of the Pagerank scheme, let us express the Pagerank r i of page v i as the composition of two functions of the (i) Pageranks of its in-neighbors I ( i ) i.e. the set of For Pagerank the function g : + 7 X  + is identity and the func-purpose of accumulating the ranks into net input rank flow, and g a monotonically increasing function mapping the net rank flow into its rank score. The functions f i for different i are assumed to have the same functional form, the superscript i indicates that the functions operate on domains of different sizes depending on the number of inlinks v i receives.

We list the kind of properties the functions g and f i should have for the ranks to be spam-resistant. We make particular choices , based on simplicity of the over-all scheme and requirements of convergence to a unique value. The function g should be mono-tonically increasing and have diminishing rate of returns. work
The experiments were carried out on a 0.4 milllion anonymized vertex subset of the web graph consisting of about 13 million edges. This was the larger of the two corpora collected for the web spam challenge-2007 [1]. 20% of the pages of this corpus are spam and has been labelled by human evaluators. The actual text or links of these pages were not made available.

Search engines use the link analytic (LA) rank-score as input to some function to give a final-score to a page, hence the value of the (LA) score is equally if not more important than just the rank according the (LA) score. Since the total probability mass or rank-score that is assigned by our ranking algorithm equals 1, the primary quality measure that we look at is how much of the total probability mass does L pq rank assign to the spam pages. This is compared with the probability mass assigned by Pagerank (or equivalently L 11 rank). The lower the mass allocated to spam pages the better is the ranking scheme, as it implies spam pages cannot be ranked high. We also include the ROC curves that plot the number of spam pages encountered as one ascends the sorted list of pages ranked by the (LA) score. The closer this curve is to the X axis the better as it implies all the spam pages are encountered at the bottom of the list. For completeness we also compare the rankings induced on the non-spam vertices with those of Trustrank by a rank distance measure, Spearman X  X  foot rule statistics [2].

Similar to the nonlinear generalization of Pagerank to L pq , the same can be done for the Trustrank model that propagates both trust-score and distrust score . We conducted separate experiments for the two directions of flow of distrust. The TrustRank formula-tion takes the direction to be same as that of the graph. We observed that this direction has a better discriminative property to separate spam and non-spam. However this direction of flow can be ex-ploited with malicious intent to demote any page and should not be used in practice, its performance gives a false sense of superiority.

It was observed that the value of q has a very significant role to play in setting the convergence rate. The number of iterations re-quired drops monotonically from several hundreds of iterations to few tens of iterations. The Effect of q on spam reduction is such that there is a best value of q at which the spam reduction is the highest, it was empirically observed to lie close to p . We found that = 1 . 2 has a good trade off between speed and spam resistance. We omit the plots for these experiments for want of space. The probability mass assigned by ( p, q ) ranks and Trust and Opp.Trust ( p, q ) ranks on the spam pages are shown in figure 2. Note that how the unlabelled ( p, q ) rank at p = 4 matches the performance of ( p, q ) Opp.Trustranks at p = 1 . Furthermore Opp.Trust model performs equally well as the conventional Trust model.
