 Nianwen Xue Abstract We describe a Chinese lexical semantic resource that consists of 11,765 predicates (mostly verbs and their nominalizations) analyzed with coarse-grained senses and semantic roles. We show that distinguishing senses at a coarse-grained level is a necessary part of specifying the semantic roles and describe our strategies for sense determination for purposes of predicate-argument structure specification. The semantic roles are postulated to account for syntactic variations, the different ways in which the semantic roles of a predicate are realized. The immediate purpose for this lexical semantic resource is to support the annotation of the Chinese PropBank, but we believe it can also serve as stepping stone for higher-level semantic generalizations.
 Keywords Chinese PropBank Frameset Frame Alternation Semantic roles 1 Introduction Developing a semantic resource typically involves building a linguistic database where semantic relations can be represented. A linguistic database is a useful resource by itself and can also be used to support the semantic annotation of natural language corpora where concepts in the linguistic database are mapped to linguistic units (e.g., words, phrases, clauses, etc.) in the text. Such annotation is valuable because it is often the case a linguistic unit in the abstract can map onto multiple semantic concepts but this ambiguity is often resolvable when the context is provided. A natural language corpus provides this crucial context whereby human annotators can resolve the ambiguity during the annotation and natural language systems can do the same by learning from human annotation. Given this scenario, creating this database is a crucial part of the semantic annotation process.

Representing the predicate-argument structure has been one of the focal points in recent efforts to develop semantic resources. This is generally achieved by specifying the semantic roles for the arguments anchored by the predicate, but the specific semantic role labels used differ from project to project. They range from very general role labels such as agent, theme, beneficiary adopted in the VerbNet (Kipper et al. 2000 ; Kipper et al. 2004 ; Kipper et al. 2006 ) and the semantic component of the Sinica Treebank (Chen et al. 2004 ), to labels that are meaningful to a specific situation, like the role labels used in the FrameNet (Baker et al. 1998 ) and the Salsa Project for German (Burchardt et al. 2006 ), to predicate-specific labels used in the English PropBank (Palmer et al. 2005 ) and the Nombank (Meyers et al. 2004 ). The difference between the various approaches can be characterized in terms of levels of abstraction. The Propbank style of annotation can be considered to be the least abstract, as it uses argument labels 1 ( Arg0 , Arg1 , etc.) that are meaningful only with regard to a specific predicate. The FrameNet role labels have a higher degree of abstraction in the sense that they abstract away from any specific predicate and are applicable to a class of related verbs (or nouns that have predicate-argument structures). For example, the  X  X  X uyer X  X  role in the  X  X  X ommerce_goods-transfer X  X  frame applies to a whole class of predicates of which  X  X  X harge X  X ,  X  X  X ease X  X ,  X  X  X ent X  X , X  X  X etail X  X ,  X  X  X etailer X  X ,  X  X  X ale X  X ,  X  X  X ell X  X ,  X  X  X end X  X ,  X  X  X uy X  X ,  X  X  X urchase X  X ,  X  X  X urchaser X  X ,  X  X  X ent X  X  are all members. The most general are the VerbNet and the Sinica Treebank, which use labels that have global meanings that abstract from specific predicates or classes of predicates and apply to all predicates (or any other categories that denote a relation). Arguments can be made for using each type of argument labels, but from an engineering point of view, it may make sense to adopt a bottom-up approach that starts with less abstract concepts, and gradually move on to more abstract concepts. This is the approach that we have adopted in the creation of the semantic lexicon to support the predicate-argument structure annotation of the predicates in the Chinese Treebank (Xue et al. 2005 ), as part of the Chinese PropBank project (Xue and Palmer 2003 ; Xue 2006 ).
 This article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 , we briefly describe the Chinese PropBank annotation and motivate the creation of this lexical semantic resource. In Sect. 3 , we discuss the necessity of making coarse-grained sense distinctions when specifying semantic roles and discuss the criteria based on which sense distinctions are made. In Sect. 4 , we discuss the considerations in the process of specifying the semantic roles and the ways in which the semantic roles are realized in subcategorization frames. We also describe some of the major syntactic alternations that are relevant to specifying semantic roles. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes this article and points to future directions. 2 The Chinese PropBank The Chinese PropBank adds a layer of semantic annotation to the Chinese Treebank by assigning semantic role labels to the constituents in a parse tree. The semantic roles are anchored by predicates that include verbs and their nominalizations. The core arguments of each predicate in the sentence receive a semantic role label in the form of ArgN , which N is an integer between 0 and 4. Each core argument plays a unique role with regard to the predicate (labeled as Rel ) and generally the total number of core arguments for each predicate does not exceed 5. The core arguments annotated for the verb  X  X  diaocha /investigate X  X  in (1) are the  X  X  jingfang /the police X  X  and  X  X  shigu /accident yuanyin /cause X  X , which are labeled as Arg0 and Arg1 respectively. The semantic role labels added to the parse tree are in bold.

In addition to core arguments, the Chinese PropBank also annotates semantic adjuncts. Semantic adjuncts are not selected by the predicate and do not play unique roles with regard to a particular predicate. Therefore the semantic role labels 2 assigned to semantic adjuncts are not predicate-specific and are represented in the form of ArgM , indicating adjunct, followed by a secondary tag representing the semantic classification of the adjunct. In (1), for example, the adverbial phrase  X  X  zhengzai /right now X  X , a temporal adjunct, is labeled ArgM-TMP and the adverbial phrase  X  X  xiangxi /thoroughly X  X  is marked ArgM-MNR , indicating manner. The complete list of adjunct tags are listed in Table 1 .

In order to consistently annotate the predicate-specific semantic roles for the core arguments, a semantic lexicon needs to be created to guide the annotation and provide the semantic content that is annotated in the corpus. In the PropBank annotation convention, such a semantic lexicon is implemented as a collection of XML-based frame files , with one frame file for each predicate. For the purpose of Chinese PropBank annotation, a total of 11,765 frame files have been created. At the top level of a frame file are the major senses of the verb called framesets . Each frameset is associated with a set of semantic roles as well as a set of subcategorization frames that realize those roles. In the Chinese PropBank annotation, each predicate occurrence in the corpus is labeled with the frameset ID and its arguments, which are constituents in a syntactic parse tree, are labeled with one of the semantic roles for that frameset. 3 Sense determination The frameset is a necessary part of the predicate-argument annotation because different senses of a predicate may take different (core) arguments. The number of arguments for different senses of a predicate may be different, or even if the number of arguments is the same, they may be different types of arguments. For example, the  X  X  X xist X  X  sense of the verb cun has two core arguments, the thing that exists and the domain in which it exists, while its  X  X  X eposit X  X  sense has three arguments, the depositor, the money, and the financial institution. The sense distinctions can be made fairly consistently when the senses have different number of arguments, but the distinctions based on argument types can be murky and difficult to make. The key to consistent frameset determination is to identify reliable criteria based on which sense distinctions can be made. One such criterion is the diathesis alternations, the different ways in which the argument structure of a verb is realized. Levin ( 1993 ) examined extensively the diathesis alternations in English and used this information to classify English verbs based on the assumption that verbs that have similar diathesis alternation patterns are also semantically similar and they fall into semantically coherent classes. The flip side of this assumption is that verbs that have different diathesis alternation patterns are also semantically different. Extending this assumption to verb senses, we expect that different senses of a verb may also exhibit different diathesis alternation patterns. One example that bears out this expectation is the verb tongugo (2). The two senses  X  X  X ass a bill or law X  X  and  X  X  X ass through a tunnel X  X  both have two core arguments, but they have different alternations. Frameset 1 demonstrates the so-called  X  X  X bject of transitive/ subject of intransitive X  X  alternation, i.e.,  X  X  zhouji /inter-state yihangfa /banking law X  X  occurs in the object position in the transitive use of the verb and in the subject position in its intransitive use. Frameset 2, however, allow dropped object, but does not allow the  X  X  X bject of transitive/subject of intransitive X  X  alternation. Although the diathesis alternation cannot be used to distinguish all possible senses, it is still an effective test in a lot of cases.  X  2  X  Verb : tongguo One of the main challenges in defining senses is the large number of dimensions along which senses can be partitioned. Even for the coarse-grained sense distinctions that are necessary for defining semantic roles, there is no going around some language phenomena that influence sense determination. A few of them are discussed here. 3.1 Idioms and metaphors One of the issues that we often have to deal with when differentiating senses is idioms and metaphors. In the context of annotating the argument structure of predicates, idioms are cases where an argument of a predicate is always realized by the same word or phrases headed by the same word. Idioms of this type generally require their own framesets as they often have very different meanings from other uses of the same predicate. Metaphors, on the other hand, generally do not call for a frameset of their own as they generally have a corresponding literal use that has a very similar argument structure.
 3.2 Light verbs Light verbs are relevant to sense determination when a verb has both light verb and non-light verb uses. The argument structure for light verb and non-light verb uses are generally different. In a light verb construction, the real predicate is the nominalized predicate that the light verb supports and the light verb itself has little meaning and therefore does not have an argument structure of its own. 3.3 Phrasal verbs Chinese is a language in which compounds form a large portion of its vocabulary. While most verb compounds are treated as one-word segments in the Chinese Treebank that require their own frame files, some verb compounds are multi-word expressions that are typically segmented as a sequence of two words. These multi-segment word compounds fall into three categories, based on the semantic relationship between the two component verbs. The two verbs can be coordinated and neither one is the head (e.g.,  X  X  kaifa /develop shengchan /produce X  X ), in which case the two verbs are each annotated with its own predicate-argument structure. The semantic lexicon will thus has an entry for each verb, but not the entire compound. In the second type of compounds, the second verb is the head and the first verb is its modifier (e.g.,  X  X  dianhuo /ignite touchan /put into production X  X ). In this case only the second verb is annotated with its argument structure and a frame file is created for it. Again, the compound as a whole does not form a stable lexical unit and thus is not an entry in the semantic lexicon. In the third type of verb compounds the head is the first verb and the second verb functions more as a particle than a full-fledged verb in the sense that it is semantically  X  X  X leached X  X . It also falls into a closed class of verbs that can occur in this position and forms a more or less stable lexical unit with the first verb. These properties suggest that this third type of verb compounds is more like the phrasal verbs in English even though they are often described as verb compounds in Chinese linguistics literature. Some examples are  X  X  jianshe -cheng /construct-into X  X ,  X  X  daban -cheng /dress-as X  X ,  X  X  kancheng -shi /consider-as X  X ,  X  X  tianjia -dao /add-to X  X ,  X  X  zengjia -dao /increase-to X  X ,  X  X  tigao -dao /improve-to X  X ,  X  X  tuichi -zhi /postpone-to X  X  and  X  X  bushu -yu /deploy at X  X . In our semantic lexicon, these phrasal verbs are not treated as separate entries. In other words, they do not have their own frame files. Rather they are treated as a frameset in the frame file for the head verb. Generally speaking, the phrasal verbs have a different argument structure from that of the head verb, as the second verb generally introduces an argument.

For the 11,765 predicates in the Chinese Treebank, 12,555 framesets are specfied for them. The vast majority of the predicates, 11,185 of them, have only one frameset. 470 of the predicates have exactly two framesets and 110 have three or more framesets. 4 Semantic role specification The semantic roles are the key information encoded in the semantic lexicon. As briefly touched upon in Section 2 , the semantic roles for core arguments and adjuncts are set up with very different philosophies. The core arguments are deemed to be predicate-specific and each argument assumes a unique role with respect to that predicate. This means that the semantic roles for core arguments are not meaningful outside that particular predicate. It is important to note that the semantic roles defined in the semantic lexicon are for expected arguments of a predicate, not just for arguments that are actually realized . In a given sentence in naturally occurring text, not all arguments have to be realized. By annotating the realized arguments in a sentence with semantic roles specified in the semantic lexicon, the arguments that are missing in the sentence can also be inferred.

Among the 12,555 framesets, the overwhelming majority of them have one to three core arguments. 4,876 of the framesets take one argument and a substantial number of one-argument verbs are so-called stative verbs (e.g.,  X  X  anning /peaceful X  X ) that are often translated into adjectives in English. Other one-argument verbs include intransitive verbs (e.g.,  X  X  shuimian /sleep X  X ) and verbs that have an incorporated argument (e.g.,  X  X  shiming /blind, losing sight X  X ). 6069 of the framesets have two core arguments, 1503 framesets have three core arguments and the remaining 107 framesets have four or more core arguments. The most arguments a frametset can have is 5.

The most important goal of the Chinese PropBank is to account for syntactic variations of the predicate-argument structure. In the Propbank annotation framework this is achieved by labeling an argument with the same semantic role independently of the syntactic position in which it is realized. The variations in semantic role realization can be either a consequence of general syntactic processes such as topicalization, relativization and passivization, or as a result of diathesis alternations that are more lexical in nature in the sense of Levin ( 1993 ). The general syntactic processes are basically accounted for in the syntactic annotation of the Chinese Treebank using empty categories and traces, and therefore the focus here is on exploring syntactic variations in Chinese that are true of classes of verbs, but not for verbs in general. In addition to semantic roles, we also list the alternating subcategorization frames for each frameset in the semantic lexicon. The alternating subcategorization frames are essentially different syntactic realizations of the semantic roles of each frameset. Although our immediate purpose for having the alternating subcategorization frames in the semantic lexicon is to provide examples for human annotators and to ensure consistent annotation, we believe we have also laid the foundation upon which Levin-or FrameNet-style classification of Chinese predicates can be performed. For example, all verbs in the same class should have the same number of semantic roles, and this information can be readily obtained from the frame files. All verbs in the same class should also demonstrate the same alternation patterns, and this information can be obtained by examining the subcategorization frames.

In a preliminary examination of the subcategorization frames in the semantic lexicon, we found that the types of syntactic alternations that Chinese verbs allow are surprisingly similar to the diathesis alternations Levin ( 1993 ) described in her work on English verbs, although further examinations are needed to determine whether these are really the same alternations. One of the most frequently occurring alternations is  X  X  X bject of transitive/subject of intransitive X  X  alternation and we have demonstrated with Example (2) that one sense of the verb tongguo ( X  X  X ass a bill X  X ) allows this alternation. The other sense of tongugo ( X  X  X ass through X  X ) allows the object to be dropped, which is also a very common alternation in Chinese. fang ( X  X  X ut, place X  X ) exemplifies a class of verbs that take three arguments: an agent generally variations of generic  X  X  fang /put, place X  X , and they differ in the manner of the placing action, the thing that is being placed or the shape and size of the location. Verbs of this class demonstrate a three-way alternation. In (3a), all three arguments are realized, with Arg0 as the subject, Arg1 as the object and Arg2 as a postverbal adjunct. In (3b), Arg0 is dropped and Arg2 is realized as the subject while Arg1 is still realized as the object. In (3c), Arg0 is still missing, but Arg1 is realized as the subject while Arg2 is realized as a post-verbal adjunct. Verbs that demonstrate this alternation pattern include  X  X  gua /hang X  X ,  X  X  fangzhi /place X  X ,  X  X  anf-ang /load X  X ,  X  X  zhuangman /load to full X  X ,  X  X  zhuangzai /load and carry X  X ,  X  X  baifang / place X  X  and they all have these three arguments.

We have discussed issues related to two main aspects of this lexicon, sense determination and semantic role specification. We have shown that sense determination at a coarse-grained level is a necessary part of semantic role specification because different senses of a predicate tend to require different semantic roles. The semantic roles are in turn postulated to account for the syntactic variations, the different ways in which the semantic roles of a predicate are realized. Although a direct evaluation of the quality of our semantic lexicon is difficult, our approach is affirmed by the fact that the semantic roles can be annotated at an accuracy above 90%.
The semantic lexicon currently has 11,765 entries and is expected to expand as new data is annotated. As we have shown in Sect. 4 , the semantic roles for core arguments are defined in a predicate-specific manner and verbs that have similar alternation patterns tend to have the same semantic roles. It seems a natural course of progression to map these predicate-specific semantic roles to more general FrameNet-or even VerbNet-style semantic roles, which we anticipate as future work. We believe this semantic lexicon will complement existing large-scale Chinese electronic dictionaries such as the Grammatical Knowledge-base of Contemporary Chinese (Yu et al. 2003 ) and the CKIP Lexicon (Chen and Huang 1990 ), which are designed with very different theoretical orientations and practical purposes.
