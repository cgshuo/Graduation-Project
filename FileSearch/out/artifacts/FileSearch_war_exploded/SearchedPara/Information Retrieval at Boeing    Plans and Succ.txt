 Many information technology pr oducts in the marketplace are designed as  X  X nterprise X  solution s and systems. Boeing is an enterprise composed of multiple enterprises: Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Integrat ed Defense Systems, Boeing Capital Corporation and Connexion by Boeing. In the necessary units are really extended enterprises due to the partnerships and business arrangements we have made, involving worldwide engineering design and manufactur ing companies, suppliers and subcontractors, air carriers and leasing operators, and military &amp; government agencies. It is difficult to scale many IT design approaches and products to the Boeing operating environment. Across the Boeing enterprise, ther e are literally thousands of  X  X roduction X  applications accessing and managing many petabytes of information. Ther e are also hundreds of thousands of formal documents, office docum ents, 3D model files, analytic files, email messages, and now multimedia files: video, photo and sound. Over the last decade , we X  X e created many thousands of web sites within our internal Intranet. In addition, Boeing must comply with stringent regulatory requirements and maintain ke y design information over the lifetime of our products, which is measured in decades. Yet Boeing must make accurate information available to all users who have authorized access. And according to industry pundits, 18-24 months. Architecture (SOA) designed to allow us to assemble and manage our computing infrastructure, while permitting us to utilize commercial off the shelf components and products. The SOA approach to applications will permit us to respond quickly to changes in business processes and allow us to take advantage of technology advancements. We also expect the number of application systems to decrease as Boeing adopts leaner business functions and processes. Coupled with the key business re quirement to make information available, we are embarked on several programs to eliminate redundant data and in tegrate existing information into major data collections that can be an alyzed and mined in support of operational reporting and business intelligence. 1.1 787 Program Information Availability The new 787 airplane program includes a Common Data Warehouse initiative. CDW is a unified environment for all reporting and analysis requireme nts for 787 product and process information. Over a period of six years, information will be copied from transactional systems and optimized to support user access. Over time, the information will be re-structured into a more neutral form, allowing the data from multiple subject areas to be more easily correlated from a business view, and more directly examined for analytic and predictive reporting. Common tools will be utilized to extract information from the CDW, allowing multiple disciplines to share definitions for data views, report formats and analytic processing. The sequencing of these subject areas will follow the 787 X  X  priority to support: 1.2 Airplane on the Ground (AOG) Example The information access needs of several personnel who support AOG situations, one of our most critical customer issues, will illustrate how the CDW X  X  single source integrated data approach will function. 1.3 E-Commerce Relationships As a major information resource, the CDW is designed to evolve along with transactional applicat ion systems as the 787 program matures. Our global community of users will be able to access the most correct information to accomplish their tasks. Events occur in life which bring changes that can affect our work and personal lives. These events are known as "Life Events." Whether it is having a baby, getting married, taking an extended absence due surgery, or retiring, these events drive the need for information to support decision-making. In 2000, the human resource function faced a number of issues related to providing accurate information to over 150,000 employees. Users had to manage multiple Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) and passwords to access information on the web or to use the telephone services. Many organizations had to be contacte d to obtain information or get questions answered and it was not clear who to first contact. No one organization assumed total responsibility to provide the necessary support. Most employees dreaded what was required of them to pull the story together and the few who were the most successful were the ones who had the best contacts into the HR function and organizations. 2.1 Role of Mergers and Acquisitions Certainly, many of the challenges that users faced were the result of the merger between Bo eing and McDonnell Douglas in 1998, Boeing X  X  acquisition of Rockwell X  X  aerospace business in 1997, and Boeing acquisition of the satellite business from previously at each of the companies and the merger and acquisition transactions merely ex acerbated the situation. It was these business events that provided almost the  X  X erfect storm X  that led to a major inves tment in Information Technology to significantly improve the situation. 2.2 HR service deliver strategy In HR, the same question can have a different answer depending over 90 union contracts, there ar e a great number of  X  X orrect answers X . What HR began to formulate was a strategy to present  X  X ne Image X  of the Boeing Enterprise to all end-users of HR services. This delivery strategy would enable users to go to  X  X ne Source X  to access HR services via the Internet or telephone. This  X  X ne Source X  would allow end-users to make  X  X ne Request X  to find informati on, perform transactions, make decisions, and receive true end-to-end HR services. 2.3 Implementing the HR delivery strategy In early 2002, Boeing began the implementation of a HR service that it branded TotalAccess. Over the next 2 years, services were converted and integrated into TotalAccess. The first release improved access to empl oyee paychecks and introduced the organizational transition to we b self-service. HR really got the attention of users when they eliminated the multiple PINs and Passwords and provided acc ess to these services from employees home computers. The web services are presented to users via the employee portal (MyBoeing) and HR is able to target or personalize th e delivery of content. 2.4 Role-based services for Managers Managers now access to a trem endous range of services to manage their teams and can perform most transactions online. This includes performance eval uations, personal development vacation and sick leave balances , overtime usage, and medical restrictions just to name a few. Previously, managers would ha ve had to contact their HR representative for each service that is now available online. 2.5 TotalAccess introduced support for certain life events Life event checklists were introduced to assist employee decision-making when faced with a Leave of Absence, Potential Job Loss due to layoff, planning fo r and initiating retirement, or the death of an employee. Future support for more life events is planned but the improvement has been valuable, especially for initiating retirement. 2.6 Summary TotalAccess is a very recognizabl e and highly utilized service within The Boeing Company. The web services on the portal receive over 4 million hits per month and are used by over 100,000 unique users. Customer satisfaction has improved Having  X  X ne Source X  to access HR services has really made a difference to users. With the introduction of TotalAccess, the human resource function has also been able to eliminate approximately 60% of its previous web content. Late r this summer, TotalAccess will be offered to over 300,000 form er employees and retirees through the externally facing MyBoeingExpress portal.
