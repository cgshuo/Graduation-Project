 We discuss how a task-based situational market segmenta-tion may be applied to on-line newspapers, distinguishing between fact finding, information gathering and browsing. During a period of four weeks we had 41 users keep a diary and recorded their surfing behavior on different on-line news-papers. The results of a Naive Bayes classification with fea-ture selection indicate that content-related attributes such as the number of news categories browsed are indispensable for task recognition.

Many of the concepts we use in recommender systems and in personalization in general stem from concepts that have long been applied in the off-line world. Market segmenta-tion is one of those concepts: we assign users to categories based on personal features and past behavior and expect users of the same market segment to be equally pleased by our recommendations. However, both in the off-line and on-line world we face the phenomenon that the same person may react differently, thus unpredictably, to the same infor-mation or product offers at different times [6]. Occasion or situation-based market segmentation is a way to handle this problem and to take a user X  X  current needs into account.
The task the user is performing at the very moment is one of the most important criteria of situational market seg-mentation [2]. We suggest a task-based market segmentation for on-line newspapers, distinguishing between fact finding, information gathering and browsing. Depending on the cur-rent task, the same user may show a different predisposition for certain content and presentation formats which requires adapted personalization strategies.

Our work focuses on the recognition of the task category by the users X  behavior. We conducted a study over a pe-riod of four weeks where we recorded the surfing behavior of 41 persons on various on-line newspapers. We used a mod-ified browser to capture every event occurring within the browser, e.g. mouse and scroll moves, clicks, loading pages etc., plus related content, e.g. information about a link that was clicked. Furthermore, the browser was extended by a surf diary in which the test persons documented the tasks they where performing on the newspapers. The detailed logs and the user diaries allow us to derive behavioral attributes that can be used for task prediction.

The subsequent section will present previous work on sit-uation-based market segmentation, taxonomies of user tasks and task recognition on the Internet. Section 3 contains a de-scription of the above-mentioned user study and its results. A discussion on the findings will be presented in section 4, section 5 deals with the study X  X  limitations. Finally, in sec-tion 6, we will give a summary and an outlook to future applications of task-based market segmentation in the field of on-line news personalization.
Most personalization algorithms are based on information on the users or content. In marketing research, the situ-ation has long been recognized as another very important explanatory variable for purchase decisions [1, 6]. Accord-ing to [1] the situation both alone and in combination with attributes of product and person explains half of the vari-ance in consumer preferences. Situational attributes indi-cate why the same person may purchase different products at different prices [6]. So, if the first article viewed on an on-line newspaper is about football, the reader is not neces-sarily interested in more football news; maybe the user only wanted to quickly look up a football result or this page view was the first step of routine news reading.

Regarding information seeking theory, there have been several approaches to task-based segmentation. First, there is a differentiation between tasks with open-ended and closed questions [9]. These two categories are complemented by serendipitous browsing [10, 3], leading to three major cat-egories of information seeking tasks: fact finding implies looking for a particular piece of information, information gathering comprises research-like activities where more than one answer on a particular topic is to be found, and brows-ing describes tasks with no specific goal in mind except being informed or entertained [7, 13]. A fourth category, transactions , was added to consider activities like on-line purchases and emailing [7, 13].

In [8] a decision tree classification of these four task cat-egories was performed, leading to an overall accuracy of 53.8%. In [5] the pilot study of the study described in sec-tion 3 was presented. In accordance with [7, 8], three task categories, fact finding, information gathering and browsing, were considered. A prediction accuracy of 95.12% (decision trees) and 87.5% (Naive Bayes), respectively, was attained. As the study was a preliminary laboratory study with given tasks for a particular on-line newspaper, the results cannot be considered as generally valid. The study presented in section 3 will show whether the results can be confirmed under considerably less restrictive conditions. Based on the findings of the pilot study, we hypothesize that on-line news-papers, with their standardized structure, offer more com-parability of the users X  behavior which might increase the task prediction accuracy.
We conducted a user study in order to explore the surfing behavior on on-line newspapers. Our goal was to find out whether the users X  behavior differs depending on the task category and to reveal important differentiating attributes that might help implementing a real-time task recognition in the future. 41 persons, 10 women and 31 men, took part in the study. The average age was 21.5 years. The majority studied busi-ness administration combined with computer science. Most of the students were recruited from a computer science class. To collect the surfing data we used an extension for the Firefox browser that recorded detailed event logs including information about the content; e.g. the number of pictures and words presented. We restricted the recording to news Websites as we expected the variance of the surfing behav-ior to be lower when considering a group of similar Web-sites. Moreover, this restriction avoided discouraging poten-tial test persons due to privacy concerns. The extension also contained a surf diary where the test persons had to assign the recorded page views to tasks and choose the respective task category; i.e. fact finding, information gathering, brows-ing or transactions.
We invited the test persons in groups to an inaugural meeting where the course of the study was explained. An in-troduction to the task taxonomy by [7] and to the operation of the surf diary was given. At home, the test persons down-loaded and activated the Firefox extension. In the course of the study we tried to encourage news reading by displaying teasers such as questions and headlines on the participant X  X  browser start page. This manipulation should also reflect occasions such as reading up on a subject because of some-body X  X  remark or recommendation. After two weeks, the participants had to complete a short quiz as a refresher on their knowledge of the given task taxonomy. After another two weeks, the study was finished with a questionnaire for eliciting details on demographics and Internet use.
The analyses presented here refer to the participants X  in-formation seeking behavior, i.e. fact finding (FF), informa-tion gathering (IG) and browsing (B). We only gathered three tasks of the category transactions which are not con-sidered in the following examinations due to this limited number. For the study, we considered a number of pop-ular German on-line newspapers, news sites of TV chan-nels, news portals such as Google News and news portals for IT and music. We collected 572 tasks ( n FF = 70 ,n IG 212 ,n B = 290), with 223 tasks coming from the most fre-quently used on-line newspaper,  X  X piegel Online X  ( n 36 ,n IG = 103 ,n B = 84). A task is a sequence of page views. The participants documented at which page view a task began and ended. Each task was linked with a label (fact finding etc.) which the participants had given in the surf diary. Tasks with only one page view were excluded. We performed our analyses both on tasks from all sites and separately on tasks from  X  X piegel X .

We derived 21 task attributes from the event logs which we assumed to be discriminating concerning the task cate-gories. The task duration and the average duration of page views have already been identified as discriminative in [7]. Furthermore, we hypothesized that with attributes referring to mouse and scroll moves and text selections, the user X  X  concentration on the content, or even reading, could be cap-tured. We also generated attributes that might reveal a predisposition for text or images, such as the number of clicks on text or images, as well as several attributes based on mouseovers  X  how many times per minute the mouse pointer hovered over an image etc. For the  X  X piegel X  analy-ses we added two further attributes that were specific to the Website: the number of news categories visited (e.g. politics) and the proportion of time spent on the front page.
We used the Kruskal-Wallis test to exclude those attributes which show no significant difference depending on the task. A subsequent Naive Bayes classification with feature selec-tion should give an insight into the feasibility of task recog-nition and reveal the most important attributes.
According to the results of the Kruskal-Wallis test con-tained in Table 1, there is a considerable number of at-tributes that show a significant difference in the way people surf on on-line newspapers depending on the task. For the tasks from all Websites the test shows only four attributes without significant difference; e.g. the scroll speed. For the  X  X piegel X  site, five further attributes had to be removed. Based on these first attribute selections, we tested a Naive Bayes classification with a wrapper feature selection and ten-fold cross validation. For the overall data set, we attained a prediction accuracy of 57.69%. One attribute was used in all the cross validation steps: the average navigation depth, which is calculated based on the number of slashes contained Table 1: Results of the Kruskal-Wallis test, task-discriminative power is indicated by  X  p &lt; = 0 . 05 .

Using the attributes approved by the Kruskal-Wallis test for the  X  X piegel X  Website, a prediction accuracy of 49.25% was achieved. Adding the number of news categories visited and the time spent on the front page in proportion to the task duration, the prediction accuracy increases to 59.64%. Both attributes were used in each cross validation step, the next best attribute is the overall area of images that was presented on average on the pages viewed during the task. Tables 2, 3 and 4 show the detailed classification results. The presented accuracy values achieved with the Naive Bayes classification are lower than the prediction accuracy attained in the pilot study, but higher than the accuracy re-ported in [8]. The lower accuracy is certainly caused by the considerably less restrictive setting as, in contrast to the pi-lot study, the participants were allowed to surf the Internet at home as they wished. The overall accuracy turned out to be lower for the single Website than for all newspaper sites which is surprising as we assumed that with a single Website, there would be less variance in the users X  behavior. Only by adding newspaper-specific attributes, the prediction accuracy could be increased such that it was slightly bet-ter than the prediction accuracy for all Websites. However, considering the precision and recall values in Tables 2 and 4, the recognition process on the single Website was more suc-cessful; e.g. considering all news sites, every task that was predicted to be fact finding belonged to another task cate-gory, and no real fact finding task was assigned correctly to its class. This may also be caused by the stronger imbalance in the number of tasks within each category with browsing being the most frequent, which is slightly lower when con-sidering only  X  X piegel X . It seems most natural that activities such as keeping up-to-date and searching for entertainment are most typical of news sites. The different distribution of tasks for  X  X piegel X  probably stems from the  X  X ews teasers X  we set on the browser X  X  start page, linking to  X  X piegel X , as it is the most popular site.

With the Kruskal-Wallis test many attributes were iden-tified that showed a significant difference depending on the task segment. Considering all Websites together, more dis-criminative attributes have been found than for the sepa-rately investigated Website (17 vs. 12). With two additional attributes specific to the newspaper  X  X piegel X , this reduced number of useful attributes could be compensated. This confirms the importance of such attributes for task recog-nition as was already hypothesized in the pilot study. In comparison with the pilot study, the Kruskal-Wallis test also confirmed the significance of the task duration, the average page view duration and the navigation depth. However, at-tributes such as the scroll speed and clicks on images do probably not contribute to the differentiation of tasks.
On the whole, the results have shown that there is a mea-surable difference in the user behavior between fact finding, information gathering and browsing. We hypothesize that further and more complex attributes will increase the task prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the results indicate that task recognition on a particular on-line newspaper can be improved by including individual characteristics of the re-spective site. A final important finding is that although the participants were similar in age and Internet experience they still showed a considerable variance in the surfing behavior. This should be scrutinized in detail in future studies.
The results depend on the test person X  X  correct under-standing of the task taxonomy and their careful labeling in the diary. We tried to positively influence the partic-ipants with a quick test after half of the duration of the study. Moreover, all tasks were labeled retrospectively, thus, it is possible that some tasks were not properly remembered when they were documented. We tried to reduce this ef-fect by instructing the participants to label each task on the same day they were performed and by reminder messages generated by the diary software. Furthermore, only a ma-nipulated Firefox browser could be used in the study, how-ever, 33 participants stated to be regular Firefox users. The other eight users rated the influence the different browser had on their surfing behavior with 2.4 on average, using a Likert scale from 1 (no influence) to 5 (strong influence). Finally, future studies will have to include further classes of Websites and samples with a broader range in age and experience. Yet, the study has shown that even with a ho-mogeneous sample there is still considerable variance in the surfing behavior. Future studies must also find a way to scrutinize transactions, as they represent an important task category in today X  X  hypermedia systems.
The knowledge about a user X  X  current situation, partic-ularly the current task, would improve many personaliza-tion services on the Internet. A study was conducted to explore whether the automatic recognition of the kind of task by the surfing behavior is feasible. A selection of task-discriminating attributes, such as task and page view dura-tion, mouse speed and navigation depth, was found using significance tests. This selection and a prediction accuracy of 59.64% indicate a real difference in the user behavior de-pending on the task. We will continue our investigations by testing whether more complex attributes, such as aggregated mouse moves, will further increase prediction accuracy.
The above-presented results show that there is still a long way to go, before sound task recognition will enable situa-tional personalization. Nevertheless, it is worth scrutinizing this area further, as task-based market segmentation offers many possibilities of making personalization more aimed at the current situation. The three categories of information seeking tasks we have considered imply different informa-tion needs, thus different strategies on how to treat a news reader depending on the current task should be chosen. De-pending on the task, one could for example choose a spe-cific method to find appropriate recommendations: For fact finding, content-based methods would probably be best suit-able, e.g. keyword matching [12], as the according tasks are focused on a very particular target such as a number or a name. Information gathering tasks, on the one hand, imply a concentration on a certain topic which indicates the need for related documents. On the other hand, the underlying task may also require documents that may not appear re-lated at first sight, but which may be found by collaborative filtering methods, such as association rule mining [11] and sequence analysis [4]. In case of browsing, it is most prob-able that users will be very interested in news articles that differ from the previously viewed ones as they are proba-bly interested in entertainment and topical diversification. That makes collaborative filtering methods and editorial in-put the most important branches of recommendation gen-eration. One might also think of offering specific services depending on the current task, such as a prominent search function for fact finding, dossiers and forums related to the subject of interest for information gathering, and videos, photo albums and interactive content for browsing.

Task-based market segmentation could also be used for commercial purposes. The three introduced task categories are probably associated with a different cognitive involve-ment, including attention and receptiveness to information, which plays an important role in advertisement. It has to be tested which modes of advertisement are best suited for the respective task categories; e.g. maybe flashy and eye-catching advertisement is especially successful for serendipi-tous browsing. This is just a small fraction of possible future applications of task-based market segmentation, but it indi-cates its value both for users and Website providers. [1] R. Belk.
