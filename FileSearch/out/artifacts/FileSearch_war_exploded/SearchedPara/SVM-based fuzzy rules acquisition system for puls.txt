 1. Introduction
Modeling of the arc welding is one of the key techniques in automated welding. Control of weld quality, such as welding penetration, and fine formation of the welding bead, is still a perplexed problem faced by control engineers and weld technol-ogists. In order to obtain the fine formation of the weld seam, the sizes of the weld pool should be exactly dominated in real time, i.e. the backside width and the topside width. The control of the weld pool shape is a critical issue in automated welding, including robotic welding. Appropriate modeling of the process is the foundation for designing the control system, and therefore an essential work for transferring welders X  operating experience to automatic welding.

However, it is very difficult to obtain a practical model of the process by classical modeling methods. For one reason, the arc welding process is characterized as inherently nonlinear, time-delay and strong coupling in its input/output relationships because it involves many uncertain factors, such as metallurgy, heat transfer, chemical reaction, arc physics, and magnetization.
For another reason, not only accuracy but also comprehensibility should be considered when modeling in the welding process. In general, comprehensibility is one of the required characteristics of reliable systems. Especially in the complex welding processes, which are affected by so many factors, a model with poor comprehensibility is unreliable. It is very difficult to obtain a model with good comprehensibility as well as satisfactory generalization capability.
 proposed to obtain the model of the arc welding process, i.e. neural network (NN), fuzzy set (FS) and rough set (RS) ( Chen et al., 1997 ; Chen et al., 2000a,b ; Wang et al., 2005 ). Some researches show that the above methods can effectively obtain the model of arc welding process under certain conditions. However, NN is a  X  X  X lack box X  X . It is impossible to directly read and modify the model obtained by NN method. For conventional FS method, it directly depends on the human operator X  X  experience, which is hard to obtain. Moreover, the number of inputs, outputs and their linguistic variables could not be too large, or it will lead to  X  X  X ule explosion X  X . As to RS theory, it is not so effective for the task of prediction, which is more like a tool for data description.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop more practical modeling methods for some complex welding processes.
 1998) , is gaining popularity due to many attractive features and promising empirical performance. Originally, SVM is developed for pattern recognition problems. Recently, with the introduction of e -insensitive loss function, SVM has been extended to solve nonlinear regression estimation, time-series prediction, system nonlinear identification and control.
 system (SVM-FRAS) for the modeling of the arc welding process.
We extract IF X  X HEN rules by SVM, construct the fuzzy inference system using fuzzy basis function, and tune the fuzzy rules and the fuzzy inference system based on gradient methods. What X  X  more, we analyze SVM-FS on the rule extraction and the inference method comparing with other fuzzy systems. Besides, we present some comparative experiments using benchmark data to illustrate the properties of the proposed fuzzy modeling method. We conduct some experiment on the arc welding process.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will provide some background knowledge of fuzzy basis function and SVM. Section 3 describes the SVM-FRAS system. In Section 4, we obtain the model of the arc welding process using our proposed approach. Finally, some discussion and conclusions are given in Section 6. 2. Preliminaries of fuzzy basis function inference system and SVM for regression
For the readers X  convenience, some background knowledge on fuzzy basis functions ( Wang and Mendel, 1992c ) and SVM for regression ( Smola and Scholkopf, 2004 ) is firstly provided in this section. 2.1. Fuzzy basis function inference system
The most common fuzzy rule-based system consists of a set of linguistic rules in the following form: IF premise  X  antecedent  X  THEN conclusion  X  consequent  X 
This form is referred as the IF X  X HEN rule. It typically expresses an inference such that if we know the fact (premise), then we can infer another fact, called the conclusion. In this work we consider the general case where the fuzzy rule base consists of M rules in the following form:
R : IF x 1 is A j 1 and x 2 is A j 2 and ... and x n is A j
THEN z is B j for j  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; M z is the output variable of the fuzzy system; and A i j and B linguistic terms characterized by fuzzy membership function u  X  x  X  and u B j  X  z  X  , respectively.

The overall fuzzy inference function is f  X  x  X  X  where f : R n -R , u A j is the point in the output space at which u B j  X  z  X  achieve its maximum value.

Let the fuzzy basis function be denoted as p  X  x  X  X 
Then f ( x ) can be viewed as a linear combination of the fuzzy basis function (FBF). In other word, the fuzzy inference system in
Eq. (1) is equivalent to the FBF expansion f  X  x  X  X 
This linear combination of fuzzy basis function is capable of uniformly approximating any real continuous function on a compact set to arbitrary accuracy. 2.2. SVM for regression estimation
We describe the linear function using the form / $ x S + b .As to the nonlinear case, we transfer the nonlinear problem into a linear problem by a nonlinear map f ( x ) from the low-dimensional input space to a higher dimensional feature space. SVM approx-imates the function using the following form: f  X  x  X  X h $ f  X  x  X i  X  b (4)
The regression problem is equivalent to the following optimiza-tion problem: min 1 2 jj $ jj 2  X  C s : t : where minimizing J $ J 2 /2 means minimizing VC dimension, and Thus, the above optimization problem is a realization of structure risk minimization (SRM) principle. Therefore, the obtained regression estimation possesses good generalization ability. C 4 0 is cost coefficient, which represents a balance between the model complexity and the approximation error. When the constraint conditions are infeasible, slack variables x i , x i * should be introduced.

In order to solve the optimization problem more easily, the dual formulation is obtained by utilizing Lagrange multipliers: min s : t :
Based on the Karush X  X uhn X  X ucker (KKT) conditions ( Karush, 1939 ; Kuhn and Tucker, 1951 ), the samples can be classified into three subsets: E set: Error support vectors: E  X  { i J a i a i * j X  C }
S set: Margin support vectors: S  X  { i j 0 ! j a i a i * j R set: Remaining samples: R  X  { i j a i a i *  X  0}
By solving Eq. (6) the approximate function is obtained: f  X  x  X  X 
The elegance of using kernel function is that one can deal with feature space of arbitrary dimension without having to compute the map f ( x ) explicitly. Any function that satisfies Mercer X  X  condition ( Courant and Hilbert, 1953 ) can be used as kernel function. 3. SVM-based fuzzy rules acquisition system
In this section, we introduce a new fuzzy rule-based inference system utilizing SVM. The architecture of the proposed SVM-step is to use SVM to extract IF X  X HEN rules; the next step is to adopt the fuzzy basis function inference system as the fuzzy inference system; the third step is the adaptive learning for the fuzzy rules and the parameters in the fuzzy inference system. We will show an example of SVM-FRAS to illustrate the idea presented in this section.

Example 1. Regress using SVM-FRAS. Samples in the simulation are generated by the following function: sinc  X  x  X  X  3.1. Extract fuzzy rules using SVM
SVM learning mechanism provides a solid foundation to extract support vectors for further use in the IF X  X HEN rules generation. As described in Section 2, only a small part of training data, the support vectors, contribute to the solution. Geometri-cally, they are points that lie on or outside the e -tube. In other words, they are in  X  X  X ey position X  X . Note that we choose only margin support vectors (0 ! j a i a i * j ! C ) because error support empirical error should be equal or more than e in this case. We will illustrate it in the first step of Example 1.

Example 1  X  Step 1: extract fuzzy rules using SVM. The train points range from 3 p to 3 p , shown in Fig. 2 . In this example, we set parameter C  X  10, the insensitive value e  X  0.05, and the with ( a  X  a * ) a 0 are identified as support vectors. Here, we obtained nine margin support vectors located at positions of ( 9.4248, 0), ( 7.330383, 0.118142), y ,(9.4248, 0), with ( a a * ) equals 0.2086, 0.23158, y , 0.20955, respectively, which are labeled with circles in Fig. 2 .

Our basic idea is to extract the fuzzy rules depending on some important  X  X  X ey points X  X , which condense decision information from learning process and provides a set of  X  X  X asis X  X  to express the overall fuzzy system. Using the obtained margin support vectors, we can derive a set of nine IF X  X HEN rules as Table 1 . In fact, the essential goal is to extract the appropriate  X  X  X ey points X  X  using the appropriate kernels. Various real-valued function estimation problems need various sets of approximating functions.
Therefore, it is important to choose or even construct special kernels that reflect special properties of the approximating functions.
 Adaptive Learning 3.2. Fuzzy inference system
We adopt the following fuzzy basis function inference system as the fuzzy inference system: y  X  f  X  x  X  X  p  X  x  X  X  exp output variables, N _ R is the number of rules, p j ( x ) is the fuzzy basis function, which indicates how close the sample is to the j th dimension, x k is the value of the k th dimension of the sample, x the value of the k th dimension of the j th rule.

The most important advantage of using fuzzy basis functions is that an IF X  X HEN rule is directly related to a fuzzy basis function.
Therefore, a fuzzy basis function expansion provides a natural framework for combining both numerical and linguistic informa-tion in a uniform fashion. The inference system reflects the human habit of thinking: the closer the sample is to the rule, the closer the output of the sample is to the output of the rule. The performance of the inference system is illustrated in the second step of Example 1.

Example 1  X  Step 2: infer using fuzzy rules and the inference system. In this example, we set parameter r 1 to be 0.3. Fig. 3 shows the regression result using the nine fuzzy rules.

Note that r k in Eq. (8) and g in the RBF kernel function may have different values, because in the inference system what we directly use are fuzzy rules, so the kernel function is not directly related to the membership function. In this example, g equals to 0.1 while r 1 equals to 0.3. Here, g and r 1 are selected using cross-validation. 3.3. Adaptive learning In this section, we propose two adaptive learning methods for SVM-FRAS. In Fig. 3 , the fitting curve can restore the basic feature of the old curve, but the fuzzy output is somewhat away from the desired values. The main reason is that the fuzzy rules are extracted by SVM directly from the samples, though they are in key position, they do not fit the fuzzy system so well. The fuzzy rules and the fuzzy inference system should be tuned, so that the fuzzy system X  X  output could well fit the regression curve. We use the gradient methods to tune the output of the rule z in the fuzzy rules and r k in the fuzzy inference system. The experiments show that the adaptive learning methods exhibit very good results in terms of accuracy. 3.3.1. Adaptive batch learning algorithm
In batch algorithm, the input data are supplied in batch. The goal of the adaptive learning is to minimize the total errors of the batch samples, so we define the following error function: E  X  1 2 where y l is the output of the l th training sample, y ld output, N _ S is the number of the samples.

The gradient method is used to solve the tuning problem for z , the output of the j th rule:
D z where Z is the learning rate.
 the output of the j th rule, is D z j  X  Z
Using the gradient method to solve for the tuning approach for the coefficient of the k th dimension r k , we obtain:
D r  X  Z @ E @ r Combining Eqs. (8), (9) and (12), we obtain:
D r  X  Z
The performance of the adaptive batch learning algorithm is illustrated in the Step 3-I of Example 1.

Example 1  X  Step 3-I: adaptive batch learning algorithm. Fig. 4 shows the regression result using adaptive batch learning algorithm. 3.3.2. Adaptive incremental learning algorithm
In incremental algorithm, the input data are supplied in sequence. The goal of the adaptive learning is to minimize the training error of the incremental sample, so we define the following error function: E  X  1 2  X  y y d  X  2 (14) where y is the output of the training sample, y d is the desired output.

The derivation is similar to the derivation in the batch algorithm, so we give the update rule directly: D z j  X  Z  X  y y d  X  p j  X  x  X  (15) D r k  X  Z  X  y y d  X 
The performance of the adaptive increment learning algorithm is illustrated in the Step 3-II of Example 1.
 Example 1  X  Step 3-II: adaptive incremental learning algorithm. Fig. 5 shows the regression result using adaptive increment learning algorithm.

In Example 1 55 samples are used. For SVM-FRAS without adaptive learning, SVM-FRAS with adaptive batch learning and SVM-FRAS with adaptive incremental learning the regression error (root-mean-square, RMS) is 0.100, 0.028 and 0.033, respec-tively. In the SVM-FRAS methods, the approach with adaptive learning outperforms that without adaptive learning. This experi-ment shows adaptive learning is helpful for improving the generalization capability. SVM-FRAS with adaptive batch learning outperforms the approach with adaptive incremental learning in precision. The reason why the increment algorithm performs worse is that in the approach the samples are supplied in sequence and the optimization effects of samples are weakened by each other to some extent. In the other hand, because in the increment algorithm the samples are supplied one by one, it could respond to the newest change of the model more rapidly. 4. Analysis of SVM-FRAS compared with other fuzzy rules acquisition system
In this section, we compare the proposed SVM-based approach to the existing methodologies that extract fuzzy rules from training data sets. 4.1. Analysis of the fuzzy rule extraction and the inference system
Wang and Mendel (1992a) develop a general method to generate fuzzy rules from numerical data. This method equally divides the input and output spaces of the given numerical data into fuzzy regions, using sum X  X roduct inference, an average defuzzier, Gaussian membership function to create the fuzzy system. The mapping is proved to be capable of approximating any real continuous function on a compact set to arbitrary accuracy. The major disadvantage of the grid-type partition is that the number of fuzzy rules increases exponentially as the number of input/output variables increases. In SVM-FRAS, only margin support vectors are selected as rules, So SVM-FRAS condenses decision information from learning process. In comparison with the grid-type partition, the SVM-FRAS does reduce the number of generated rules. Fig. 6 (a) and (b) depict the grid-type and SVM-FRAS partition-based approach, respectively.

In Wang and Mendel (1992b) , a trainable fuzzy system called back-propagation fuzzy system (BP FS) is developed. In BP FS fuzzy system are viewed as a three-layer feed forward network, and a back-propagation algorithm is developed for training them to match desired input/output pairs. BP FS is used as identifiers for nonlinear dynamic systems. In BP FS many parameters in FBF and
Gaussian membership function such as z j , x i j and s i j determined, which is too time consuming. The initial parameter choosing method in BP FS is random to some extent In SVM-FRAS,
SVM at least provide good initial parameter, and in some case rules extracted by SVM can be used directly for the accepted accurate and little computation time.

Wang and Mendel (1992c) proposed an orthogonal least-square-based approach (OLS-based). The OLS-based approach can be viewed as a regression model with the ability of sparse approximation. Assume that there are m training points f x ; ... ; x m g in the training set, and we are given input X  X utput m
P , from the basis function P  X f p j j j  X  1 ; ... ; m g , whereas m and to design a set of parameters y 1 ; ... ; y m s such that d  X  t  X  X  where e ( t ) is the error function, and it needs to be minimized. The basic idea of the proposed method is similar to the OLS-based approach, that is, choosing key points within the training points.
But it adopts a different approach to extract the  X  X  X ey points X  X . In the proposed approach, SVM is used to select  X  X  X ey points X  X , which are used to construct the fuzzy system. Compared with the
FALCON-ART approach and OLS-based approach, our approach is more intuitive in some sense, for our  X  X  X ey points X  X  are in key positions, which help to shape and define the decision function.
SVM adopts the SRM principle and a global optimal solution is obtained. In the OLS-based approach, greedy algorithm is used and that will result in a locally optimal solution.

Lin and Lin (1997) introduce a clustering partition-based approach, that is, ART-based fuzzy adaptive learning control network (FALCON-ART). It combines the back-propagation learn-ing scheme for parameter learning and the fuzzy ART algorithm for structure learning. It partitions the input state space and output control space using irregular fuzzy hyperboxes according to the distribution of training data. More notably, the FALCON-ART can on-line partition the input/output spaces, tune membership functions, find proper fuzzy logic rules, and annihilate redundant rules dynamically upon receiving online incoming training data.
However, in the FALCON-ART approach, the inference system is embedded in the fuzzy adaptive learning control network. It is difficult for the model users, who are field experts but laymen of modeling methodology, to fully understand the model.

In Chiang and Hao (2004) , SVM inference system is repre-sented as series expansion of fuzzy basis function. It makes SVM more interpretable to some extent, but in substance SVM has poor comprehensibility. For example, how to understand ( a i a as a fuzzy system? Our inference mechanism is directly based on fuzzy rule while SVM do not use fuzzy rule directly. The second difference is that only margin support vectors are used in our approach so as to reduce the influence of the noise. Error support vectors are far from the regression curve, which cannot express the essential information for the system.

Jang (1993) introduce an architecture and learning procedure underlying ANFIS (adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference sys-tem), which is a fuzzy inference system implemented in the framework of adaptive networks. By using a hybrid learning procedure, the proposed ANFIS can construct an input X  X utput mapping based on both human knowledge (in the form of fuzzy
IF X  X HEN rules) and stipulated input X  X utput data pairs. The major disadvantage of the ANFIS is that the number of fuzzy rules increases exponentially as the number of input/output variables increases. 4.2. Experimental result of comparative experiment using benchmark data
The time series used in the simulation is generated by the chaotic Mackey X  X lass differential delay equation ( Courant and
Hilbert, 1953 ): _ x  X  t  X  X 
In the simulation, we set the parameter t  X  30. The prediction of future values of this time series is a benchmark problem, which has been considered by a number of connectionist researchers (Lin and Lin, 1997 ; Juang and Lin, 1998 ; Wang and Mendel, 1992a,c).

The goal of this task is to use known values of the time series up to the point x  X  t to predict the value at some point in the future x  X  t + P . The standard method for this type of prediction is to create a mapping from D points of the time series spaced D , value x ( t + P ). To compare with earlier work ( Lin and Lin,1997 ;
Wang and Mendel, 1992a,c), the values D  X  9 and D  X  P  X  1 are used, i.e., nine-point values in the series are used to predict the value of the next time point. The 200 points of the series from x (501) x (700) are used as training data, and the final 300 points of the series from x (701) x (1000) are used as test data. Fig. 7 shows 1000 points of this chaotic series used to test our model. In this experiment, for the purpose of comparison, we set parameter  X  0.02. We obtain 20 SVs. The precisions (root-mean-square) and comprehensibility of the relevant methods are listed in Table 2 . Fig. 8 depicts the prediction performance of the three SVM-FRAS methods for the same data.

Table 2 and Fig. 8 shows that the proposed approaches possess satisfactory generalization capability as well as high comprehen-sibility. Compared with the FALCON-ART and the OLS-based approach, in terms of accuracy, the SVM-FRAS methods have better or at least equally good generalization capability; the SVM-FRAS methods using less fuzzy rules than the OLS-based approach; the SVM-FRAS methods have the same inference system as the OLS-based method, that is, fuzzy basis function inference system, which has good comprehensibility than neural network (FALCON-ART model). We also compare SVM-FRAS with ANFIS initialized with fuzzy c-means and ANFIS initialized with SVM. ANFIS with fuzzy c-means and ANFIS with SVM show good result. However, they are both time consuming because there are five layers in ANFIS, which means more computing time. ANFIS with SVM needs fewer rules because SVM helps to shape and define the decision function. In the SVM-FRAS methods, the SVM-FRAS methods with adaptive learning outperform the SVM-FRAS without adaptive learning; SVM-FRAS with adaptive batch learning outperforms SVM-FRAS with adaptive incremental learning in precision. 5. Modeling for the GTAW process using SVM-FRAS In this section, we obtain the model using SVM-FRAS for the GTAW process. Note that a different welding technology may lead to different model, which can be obtained by a similar method. 5.1. Select input/output variables for modeling of the GTAW process
We first give the following analysis about the input/output variables for modeling of the welding process: (1) The input variables should include the weld current ( I ). Weld Host computer (2) The geometry parameters of the weld pool should be (3) The history information (including welding parameters and (4) The output of the model should be the backside weld width
We adopt the system in Fan et al. (2007) to acquire images and define the geometry parameters of the weld pool. Fig. 9 shows the experiment system. The double-side visual sensor system captures the topside and backside images of the weld pool simultaneously. The topside and backside sizes of the weld pool are acquired by a real-time image-processing algorithm. Fig. 9 shows a complete weld pool image. Define the pool characters as: the backside maximum width ( W B ), the topside maximum width ( W T ) and the topside maximum length ( L T ), as shown in Fig. 10 .
These parameters could be used to describe the pool characters in full penetration.
 geometry parameters, W T , L T , W B ( W B in the previous periods) to predict the backside weld width. Formally, the t th time datum will be denoted as a vector d t  X  X  I t L t T W t T W t B . Considering the influence of the history information, we extend raw data d ments, when the t th time weld pool begins to form, the ( t -4)th time weld pool has solidified and it has almost no influence on the t th weld pool. So it is appropriate that k  X  3 and the model entry of D t ). 5.2. Acquire the raw data for modeling of the GTAW process the major welding parameters that vary during welding are considered in the experiment designing. Based on the analysis about the welding process I is selected as the input signals.
Random signals are considered as the optimal input signals to the welding process. The size parameters of the weld pool are measured on-line with the double-side visual-sensing system. The welding conditions are listed in Table 3 . 5.3. Extract fuzzy rules using SVM-FRAS for modeling of the GTAW process
We adopt the RBF kernel K  X  x i ; x j  X  X  exp  X  g jj x i x the kernel function of SVM. The arc welding process is inherently nonlinear. The RBF kernel nonlinearly maps samples into a higher dimensional space, so it can handle the case when the relation between inputs and outputs is nonlinear.

Using the margin support vectors obtained as above, we can derive a rules table. Part rules are shown in Table 4 . The fuzzy inference function adopted in this application is Eq. (8). After linearly scaling each attribute to the range [ X 1,+1], we set r ( k  X  1,2, y ,15)  X  0.75. Tuned by the adaptive batch algorithm, parameter r k ( k  X  1,2, y ,15) vary to 0.454,0.430, y respectively, and part rules are shown in Table 5 . Tuned by the to 0.415, 0.401, y ,0.302, respectively, and part rules are shown in Table 6 .

From the data, we can know that both rules and parameters are both adjusted, and the increment algorithm adjusts less than the batch algorithm. The reason why the increment algorithm adjusts less is that in the approach the samples are supplied in sequence and the optimization effects of samples are weakened by each other to some extent. 5.4. Experiments results
For the purpose of validating the models, the data set is randomly split into 300 training samples and 200 test samples. The precision of SVM-FRDS methods in modeling for aluminum-alloy-pulsed TIG process are listed in Table 7 . For SVM-FRAS without adaptive learning, SVM-FRAS with adaptive batch learning and SVM-FRAS with adaptive incremental learning, and the RMS error are 1.33, 0.96 and 1.06mm, respectively. Fig. 11 shows the error curves of the three methods for the same data. Considering the complexity of the aluminum alloy pulsed GTAW process the proposed approaches especially that with adaptive learning, are quite acceptable.
 6. Conclusion
This paper proposes a SVM-based fuzzy modeling method for the arc welding process. SVM is used to select significant fuzzy basis functions, linear combination of fuzzy basis functions is used to construct the final fuzzy rules acquisition system, both the fuzzy rules and the fuzzy inference system are tuned using gradient methods. Comparative analysis and tests about SVM-
FRDS with respect to other fuzzy systems show that the new approach possesses satisfactory generalization capability as well as high comprehensibility. We use the proposed SVM-FRAS to obtain the rule-based model of the aluminum alloy pulse GTAW process. Experimental results show the SVM-FRAS model is effective.
