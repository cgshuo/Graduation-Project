Classification is a popular data mining task, where the value of a discrete (dependent) variable is predicted, based on th e values of several independent variables. In this research, we investigate how predictive classification models can be inf erred from the available data. The classification models are requi red to make good predictions, and be comprehensible and intuiti ve. The aspect of humanly understandable and intuitive models i s of crucial importance in any domain where the model needs to be validated before it can be implemented, such as in the medical diagnosis and credit scoring domain. A classificati on model that is accurate, comprehensible and intuitive is defi ned in this thesis as acceptable for implementation. Building s uch acceptable models is the goal of this text.

We examine how rule based classifiers can be built that satisfy these requirements. In a first approach, we use rule extraction from Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to extract rules that are accurate, comprehensible, and mimic the SVM model as much as possible. Next, the use of artificial ant colonies for classification is studied, attempting to induc e acceptable classification models from data. In a final part, we discuss the application of the investigated algorithms f or real-life case studies, such as the prediction of defaults, going concern opinions, software faults, and business/ICT align ment. SVM Rule Extraction
We examine how rule based classifiers can be built that satisfy the aforementioned prerequisites. An initial expl oratory benchmarking study examines the current opportunities for SVM rule extraction [2]. With these lessons learnt, a new methodology is developed for SVM rule extraction: active learning based approach (ALBA) [6]. ALBA extracts rules from the trained SVM model by explicitly making use of key concepts of the SVM: the support vectors, and the observatio n that these are typically close to the decision boundary. Act ive learning implies the focus on apparent problem areas, which for rule induction techniques are in the regions close to the SVM decision boundary where most of the noise is found. By generating extra data close to these support vectors, tha t are provided with a class label by the trained SVM model, rule induction techniques are better able to discover suita ble discrimination rules.
 performance (and to some degree comprehensibility) have been well researched, measuring justifiability has not yet b een handled. The proposed measurement can be applied to all rule based and linear classifiers.
 Real-Life Case Studies
The AntMiner+ technique is validated as a potential data mining tool to be used in business practices with a number of real-life case studies. The applications can be divided i n financial engineering and information systems application s. As the aim is the final acceptance of the model, all these cases ar e carried out in close collaboration with the respective doma in experts.

The first case study concerns the assessment of credit risk, and more specifically determining whether a counterpart wil l default on his/her financial obligation. Since the credit ri sk models will be subject to supervisory review and evaluation , they must be easy to understand and transparent. Hence, techniques such as neural networks or support vector machin es are less suitable due to their black box nature. Building upon previous research, AntMiner+ is used to build internal rating systems for credit risk. Experiments are conducted u sing various types of credit data sets: retail, small-and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) and banks. It will be shown that the extracted rule sets are both powerful in terms of discrimina tory power, and comprehensibility. Furthermore, a framework is presented describing how AntMiner+ fits into a global Basel II credit risk management system.

The second case concerns the prediction of the going concern opinion [3], as issued by an auditor (such as KPMG, Deloitte, PWC and Ernst &amp; Young). The auditor is required to evaluate whether substantial doubt exists about the clie nt entity X  X  ability to continue as a going concern. Accounting de-bacles in recent years have shown the importance of proper an d thorough audit analysis. To provide specific audit guidelin es, we infer rules that are subsequently converted into a decisi on table allowing for truly easy and user-friendly consultati on in every day audit business practices.
 Alignment between business and ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in organisations is still high o n the management agenda of many a Chief Information Officer (CIO), and constitutes our third practical case [1]. Most often, making sure that investments in ICT are in harmony with the organisation X  X  business objectives proves to be mo re challenging than initially expected, especially in today X  s fast-changing, dynamic environment. A lot has been written on B/ICT alignment, yet there are few studies that come up with actionable results that can be used by practitioners. In thi s study practical guidelines for managers are described on ho w to strive for better alignment of ICT investments with busin ess requirements based on the inferred patterns.
 Finally, AntMiner+ is used for software fault prediction [7 ]. Software managers are routinely confronted with software projects that contain errors or inconsistencies and exceed budget and time limits. By mining software repositories wit h comprehensible data mining techniques, predictive models can be induced that offer software managers the insights they ne ed
