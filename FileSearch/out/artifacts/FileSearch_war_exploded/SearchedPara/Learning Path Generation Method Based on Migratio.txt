 In the era of knowledge explosion, finding an efficient way to the target knowledge , called as learning path in this paper , in these too many learning materials is a problem knowledge they need , as it is universal that people reach their destinations efficiently relying on navigators . Traditionally, most of the learning strategies are made by teach-ers or experts. As a result, the learning strategies are personnally and sub jective. In the process of learning, learners will also have problems such as cognitive overload or cog-nitive impairment due to the inappropriate learning order of concepts which leads to the inefficiency of learning. Therefore, in the information age wit h knowledge expand-ing and updating rapidly, it has been far from being able to meet the needs of learners relying solely on the individual or an educational group.
T he data generated by human activities are enriching the knowledge space con-stantly. The dev elopment of Internet has greatly accelerated the growth of information, which makes people begin to explore the way to organize the useful information, so there is a knowledge organization form named knowledge base which is a knowledge cluster after the artificial systematization and standardization, such as Wikipedia. 
In recent years, the rapid development of the World Wide Web has l ed to the study of knowledge space. Lexical relations diagram, semantic relevance, knowledge ontol-ogy, semantic network, etc. have been applied to the text classification, word disam-biguation, machine translation and so on. These studies also provide a the oretical basis for the learning path generation. 
The knowledge base absorb s new knowledge and establish s the connection between concepts quickly while the book is authoritative and academic. Therefore, in this paper, we put forward a learning path generat ion method making full use of the knowledge faster.

Our main contributions are as follows:  X  We build a basic concept set in the computer domain and propose a graph model for concepts to express the concepts and their relationships;  X  We propose a learning path generation method based on migration and similarity between concepts;  X  We build two test data sets and evaluate the generated learning path by scoring and the c onsistency degree between paths.

In this paper, we creatively apply semantic similarity to the generation of learning path , and propose a new graph model for concepts to express their relationships. We use Wikipedia to construct the graph model for th e target concepts automatically, with-out manual assistance.

Our study takes Computer Science disciplin e as an example, but our metho d' s scope of application is not limited to Computer Science . Our method is based on Wikipedia and the books on the subject, which makes it possible to migrate to other subject areas at low cost, thus benefiting more learners in various fields.
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review related works . In Section 3, we propose our method of the learni ng path generation . Section 4 de-Section 5, we give the conclusion . 2.1 Approaches to Learning Path Generation The rapid development of the Internet brings people into an era of e -learning, more and more scholars turn to the automatic generation of learning strategies .
 a knowledge unit, and the directed edges represent the relati onships between knowledge units: precedence, succession or parallel. The weight of the edge represents the diffi-culty of learning from the precedence concept to the succession concept. The initial value was given by the teacher, and then updated according to the learning of the pre-vious student s , so that the learning path generation problem turns into the shortest path problem in graph theory.

L in CF, Yeh Y, Hung YH et al. [2 ] developed a personalized creative learning sys-tem (PCLS) in 2013 based on decisio n tree in data mining technology. PCLS provides personalized learning path to optimize creativity. It includes a series of creative tasks and a questionnaire that involves several key volumes. They brought together 92 col-lege students to try the system. Th e test results show that the learners have a 90% prob-ability of achieving an above -average creativity score when the learning path proposed by the hybrid decision tree is used. In addition, this study integrates personalized learn-ing and game learning into creative learning programs which greatly improves learners' learning enthusiasm and learning effects.

Lendyuk T, Melnyk A, Rippa S et a l. [3 ] proposed an individual learning path gen-eration method using the learning object sequence to navigate the learnin g content. They adjusted the difficulty of problem next stage to solve according to the number of right answered questions in previous stage which allowed learners to improve their knowledge level gradually.

Bo nifati A, Ciucanu R, Lemay A [4 ] proposed a le arning path generation method that satisfies the path query conditions of the user on the graph database. The input of the algorithm includes a graph database in which the user marks the node as a positive or negative case based on whether he wants the nod e to be part of the query result. In the study, they were concerned with the path query defined by the regular expression and investigated an interactive situation: starting with an empty example set, they de-fined the information nodes are those that are h elpful to the learning process, and then let the user tag these nodes. After that, repeatedly check -tag process until he is satisfied with the query results.

In the above mentioned methods, most of the learning path generating methods are parameters or interactive data. In order to generate a proper learning path for the learner, they use the learner's society and learning background information, personality infor-mation, th e learner's test results or even ask the learners to mark learning weights di-rectly. Their methods cost a lot of manpower, and is too subjective. And their methods are limited to one knowledge field. 2.2 Word Similarity calculating word similarity are divided into four categorie s according to the basic method adop ted: word similarity calculating based on vector space mo del, word simi-larity calculating based on text attri bute s , word similarity calculating based on sequence alignment and word similarity calculating based on semantic analysis. 
In the vector space model, the text is regarded as a collection of basic language units (word, phrase, etc.), and it is assumed that the te xt feature is only relevant to the fre-quency of some basic language units, with its position or order in the text not considered the text attributes used in the study include th e new word occurrence rate [5], the over-characters when c alculating w ord s imilarity based on the s equence al ignment , so that the text similarity calculation turn into the calculation of sequence similarity. Com-monly used methods include Hamming Distance, Edit Distance, the Longest Common ymy, antisense, upper and lower relations to calculate the similarity. The advantages and disadvantages of the four kinds of methods are shown in Table 1.

We used the vector space model to caculate the similarity between words via the word2vec, a tool provided by Google. We trained a CBOW ( Continuous Bag -of -Words Model ) model of word2vec using the Wikipedia corpus described in Section 3.2. 3.1 Definition of Learning P ath Learning path is a list of relevant concepts. The relevant concepts refers the concepts have semantic connection, which can be measured by word similarity. In this paper, the learning paths are divided into two kinds :  X  Single -Target Learning Path. An orderly sequence of concepts generated for one target concept that needs to be learned. The relevant concepts are ranked in descend-ing order of the concept ' s relevance to the target concept. For example, the learning path of the target concept jQuery can be the list: JavaScript , jQuery UI , plugin , jQuery Ajax , HTML , jQuery .  X  Multi -Target Learning Path. Learners have several concepts that need to be learned. For ex ample, when they preview a new unit , they want to learn some emerg-ing concepts of the unit, which are often relevant. These concepts that need to be learned constitute the target concept set, and the multi -target learning path is a di-rected graph generated for the target concept set, in which the node represen ts the target concept, and the direction of the edge represents the learning order. For exam-ple, the learning path of the target concept set { array, tree, stack, list, queue } can be the learning order shown in Fig . 1.
 3.2 Data Preprocessing W e propose a learning path generation method based on Wikipedia, the authoritative course guidelines and professional books.  X  Wikipedia. The Internet Encyclopedia is the largest and most complete human know ledge base that is currently available for random access. Wikipedia is the larg-est Internet multilingual encyclopedia compiled by humans. As of April 8, 2017, 
Wikipedia has a total of 5,378,718 articles, 41,883,956 pages, which cover most of the human know ledge areas. The original data set used to build the graph model and train the similarity model is a compressed file for all Wikipedia pages(2016.06.01), a 53.4 GB XML file after decompression. In the experiment to determine the relevant concepts of the ta rget, the online Wikipedia is used because of the consideration of web page redirection. We extracted the title of each pag e as an entry from the original 
XML file, and extract the text with a hyperlink in the page (hereinafter referred to as hyperlink text ) to build data set called as wiki_R. Each line in wiki_R.txt represents the contents of an entry in the following format: page corresponding to the entry. "#" is the delimiter.  X  Course G uidelines . Computer Science is a fast -growing discipline with much knowledge. Learners often feel confused when they study . Therefore, we choose the 
Compu ter Science as an example. In the field of computer, ACM and IEEE are the authoritative institutions, and t he two agencies jointly issued 13 guidelines to lead the direction of the development of computer courses: CC1991, CC2001, IS2002, 
CE2004, SE2004, CC 2005, IS2006, IT2008, CS2008, SE2009, IS2010, CS201 and 
SE2014, all of which are incorporated into the original data set in this study.The basic concept set volume_R can be obtained by analyzing the distinction of com-the original guidelines: a. Delete the URL and special characters in  X   X  , and then extract the fields around b. Filter the document d1, d2, d3, d4 artificially. Removing those wo rds that not c. Repeat the above steps for each course guideline. Finally summarize  X   X  and elim- X  Books . In the computer field, the knowledge update is fast. As a result, the bo oks are too many. T his study will look to the the computer field part in Wiley database . 
Wiley, founded in the United States in 1807, is the world's larg est independent aca-demic book publisher and the third largest academic journal publisher. In this paper, we use the Wiley online collection of books subscribed by the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences collecting books from Wiley -Blackwell, Wiley -VCH, Jossey -Bass and so on. We download 181 books in computer field to construct a book library CSLibrary. 
The 181 books are divided into three categories:75 of Computer Science, 67 of Gen-eral Computing, 39 of Information Science and T echnology. In order to facilitate the follow -up experiment, we use PDFMiner to turn pdf document into txt document. 3.3 Extraction of Relevant C oncepts How to find the relevant concepts for the target concept is the key to constructing our model. In this section, we extract ed relevant concepts from Wikipedia and books based on word similarity .  X  Extract relevant concepts from Wikipedia. In Wikipedia, the concept exists in the form of an entry, and its structure is reflected by the hyperlinks between pages. And we find these link s have a large or small correlation with the concept tc . Therefor e , we use the hyperlinks to extract relevant concepts from Wikipedia. The specific steps are as follows: a. Extract all the hyperlink texts from the Wikipedia page corresponding to the target b. Calculate the similarity between the target concept tc and each hyperlink text c. Take the first k concepts in HLinkList to form the relevant concept set named as  X  Extract relevant concepts from book s . A concept is cl osely relevant to its context . 
Thus, it can be assumed that the concepts appear ing adjacently in the text are related to each other stronger. W e try to use the computer course guideline s published by 
ACM and IEEE to establish a basic concept set in compute r domain. This process has been described in detail in Section 3 .2 . It should be noted that the basic concept set volume_R can not completely cover the basic concepts in the book, for which we make full use of the index of the book. We extract relevant con cepts from books as follows: a. For a book b , extract the basic concepts that appear in the book according to vol-b. Add the search terms that appear in the index of b and the page number that it c. Rank the concepts in BasicSet according to the page number they first appear . d. For a target concept tc in the book b that needs to be learned, search for its index e. For each concept rc in CandidateSet, calculate the similarity between the target f. Take the first k relevant concepts in CandidateList to constitute the relevant con-3.4 The Generation Method For the two cases , we propose different generation methods respectively.  X  Single -Target Learning Path G eneration . The single -target learning path is to help learners have a better understand of the target co ncept. The simple -target learning path generation method combines the relevant con-cepts e xtracted from Wikipedia and books. The specific steps are as follows: a. F or the single target concept tc given by the learner, extract the candidate relevant b. Take the union of RCsFromWiki and RCsFromBook as RCs (the size of the set c. Take the first k concepts in RCsList as the single -target learning path of tc .  X  Multi -Target Learning Path G eneration . Given a concept set, how to determine the order of these concepts in o rder to minimize the difficulty of learning? In other words, h ow to reduce time and effort spent as far as possible? To solve this problem, the concept of jumps is introduced in Wikipedia to measure the learning difficulty between two concepts. For the two pages in Wikipedia page1 and page2 , the jumps of page1 to page2 are defined as:
The minimum number of clicks required clicking on the link in page1 to finally jump to page2 . If the number is greater than MAX_CLICK, we said that the distance of page1 to page2 is infinity ( X ).

After introducing the concept of jumps , we can build a weighted directed graph model for a concept set, in which the node represents the target concept, and the direc-tion of the edge represents the jump direction beween pages corresp onding to the con-cep t s, the weight of the edge is the jumps .It can be seen in Fig . 2.
With the definition of jumps and the graph model constructed successfully, we can get the multi -target learning path generation method: a. Calculate the jumps for any of the two concepts  X  X  X   X  and  X  X  X   X  in the given target b. Fin d the "path" to learn the target concepts with the least number of jumps, that We set up a series of experiments to detect the effectiveness of the proposed method. 4.1 Test D ata  X  T est D ata for S ingle -Target Learning Path Generation M ethod .
 For the single -target learning path, we selected the book containing more than 150 basic concepts as the original test data set based on CSLibrary described in Section 3 .2, for a total of 86 books: 60 of Computer Science , 23 of General Computing, 3 of Information Science and Technology. We randomly selected 10 basic concepts from each book to constitut e the test set test_860 which contains a total of 860 basic concepts obviously.  X  Test Data for Multi -Target Learning Path Generation Method.
 concepts need to be studied under the navigation of the goal. For example, When the learner wants to learn file operation while he learns C++ programing language, his tar-cache , router such concepts that are not consistent with the goal. Therefore, in order to ensure the test is practical enough , we use artificial data sets rather than randomly gen-erated. We collected 500 target concept set s from the student volunteers. The target concept set size varying from 6 to 10. The ratio is 1: 1: 1: 1: 1, respectively, denoted as TCSet_6_100, TCSet_7_100, TCSet_8_100, TCSet_9_100, TCSet_10_100. 4.2 Evaluation  X  Evaluation M e thod for S ingle -T arget L earning P ath .
 For the evaluation of the single -target learning path, we adopted the teacher and student scoring strategy: a. Invite 50 teachers, covering lecturers, associate professors, professors, the ratio b. Each teacher student give a score in 0 -10 for the generated learning path, and c. Take the average of teacher_score and student_score as the comprehensive score  X  Evaluation Method for Multi -Target Learning Path.
 For the evaluation of the multi -target learning path, we use two methods: a. T he sco rin g strategy referred above ; b. I nvite 50 teachers to make learning paths for the target concept sets, recorded as Where x is the length of the result string and y is the length of the standard string. 
The smaller the Levenshtein D istance , the higher the similarity of the two strings, and the more consistent the result learning path and the standard learning path, in other wo rds, the better the result s of the proposed method. 4.3 Results For the target concepts given by the learner, we test ed on data set mentioned in Section 4 .1 and evaluated according to th e evaluation method s in Section 4 .2.  X  Single -T arget L earning P ath R esults .
 We experimented on the test set test_860. In the experiment, k was set to 5 while m was set to 8. 860 learning paths were obtained according to the method proposed i n Section 3 .4, and then we calculated teacher_score , student_score and final_score after ge tting the scores from teachers and students . T he scores were divided into five intervals: [0,2), Table 2 .

We can see tha t 96% of the 860 learning paths ' final_ score are not less than 2 points and 59% are not less than 6 points. 30% fall in the [8,10] interval. It can be said that the generated learning paths are highly recognized by the teachers and students. How-ever, there are scores less than 4 points. It seems led by the relativation of the rele vance concepts extraction . We extract relevant concepts via hyperlinks in Wikipedia and the context of the target concept in the book. Although we filter out of the concepts with lower similarity with the target concept, the compare is too relative in some cases.  X  Multi -Target Learning Path Result s .
 In the e xperiment, the MAX_CLICK was set to 6. The experimental results on the 6 test data sets mentioned in Section 4 .1 were denoted as ResultLP_6_100, Re-sultLP_7_100, ResultLP_8_100, ResultLP_9_100, ResultLP_10_100. a. E valuation Results using Scoring S trategy
The number of learning paths in each score interval for each of the six result sets is shown in Table 3 .
F rom Table 3 we can see that even if the size of the target concept set is different, the difference of learning paths in each score interval is not more than  X  10 , and the number of generated learning paths gaining score not less than 6 is more than 6 0. We results. Moreover, more than 60% of the generated learning paths gain a score not less than 6.

When building the graph model for the target concept set, the value of jumps be tween two pages depend s on the links in the page totally. Due to indeterminacy of the page links and the editors ' subjectivity, there will be the case that the value of jumps is greater than MAX_CLICK. M ore generally , there may be the case that the value o f jumps from learning path will have a random sequence in c 1 , c 2 which will lead to the deviation. b. Evaluation results of standard path comparison .
 We invited 50 teachers to make learning paths for TCSet_6_100, TCSet_7_100, TCSet_8_100, TCSet_9_100, TCSet_10_100 as standard learning paths. In accordance with Secti on 4 .2, the generated learning path and the standard learning path on the same target concept set were mapped to two strings, and we caculated their similarity to measure the consistency between them . The path consistency with the target concept set size varying fr om 6 to 10 is shown in Table 4.

It is shown that when the size of the target concept set is 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10, the difference of th e number of learning paths falling in each similarity interval is less than  X  5 , and standard learning path was more than 60. We can draw the conclusion: T he size of the generated learning paths can match the standard path with 70% and above. In this paper, we focus on the problem how to help learners to learn the knowledge they need better and faster. In v iew of the limitations of the existing learning path generation methods, we p ropose a learning path generation method with the combine of the tradi-tional learning and modern network learning aiming at all learners.
 measure the relevance of concepts. Moreover, we introduce jump steps in Wikipedia to measure the difficulty of different learning orders. Based on the hyperlinks in Wikipe-dia , we build a graph model for the targe t concepts, and achieve multi -target learning path generation based on the minimum spanning tree algorithm. We test the proposed method on the books about Computer Science in Wiley database and test sets provided by volunteers. We evaluate our method by ex pert scoring and path matching. The re-sults show that more than 59% of the 860 single -target learning paths generated by our method are highly recognized by teachers and students. More than 60% of the 500 multi -target learning paths can match the standard path given by experts with 70% and above. 
Considering the truth that the graph model in this paper is built automatically, with-out any manual work, our method is manpower saving and the results are more objec-tive . In future research, we will build a broad er library of books and construct a basic concept set covering more fields to serve more learners.
