This special issue explores the recent advances in semantic technology and its application in information and engineering systems by bringing together original scientific contributions in the form of theoretical and experimental research, and case studies.

The Special Issue is a multidisciplinary effort with a clear international dimension both in terms of its Guest Editors and contributors. The Guest Editors, Rossi Setchi from Cardiff Uni-University of Chile, Chile, and Cungen Cao from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, have provided combined expertise in Knowledge and Systems Engineering, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. The authors who have contributed to the Special Issue come from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Korea, Poland, Singapore, Spain and the USA.

The papers included in the Special Issue make extensive use of semantics to represent knowledge and reason with it. Most papers use application-oriented domain ontologies as an enabling technology that provides a formal knowledge representation mechanism for shared understanding and logical reasoning. For example, Vegetti et al. propose a product ontology that represents product information both as an abstraction and a structural hierarchy. Two research teams have developed fuzzy ontologies. Keyarsalan and Montazer X  X  traffic ontology includes fuzzy proper-ties, membership functions and rules while Esposito and De Pietro X  X  medical ontology contains linguistic variables and fuzzy rules. Barros et al. use a pedagogical ontology as a core compo-nent of their intelligent tutoring system, Colucci et al. describe core competences within an organization using a skills ontology, and Blanco-Fernandez et al. base their personalized recommender system for online shopping on an ontology of commercial pro-ducts. Chan et al. link their electronic health record system to a well-structured medical ontology containing a systemized nomenclature of medical terms.

A different type of contribution to semantic knowledge repre-sentation is the work of Trzupek et al. who use graph formalisms to link the semantic descriptions of 3D medical images to a knowledge base of medical expertise. Jabrouni et al. use con-ceptual graphs for the semantic conceptualisation of the domain vocabulary, and a transferable belief model for the fusion of information from different sources.

The added value of using ontologies as conceptualization formalism is in the potential not only to enhance the knowledge base but also to improve the reasoning with it. Keyarsalan and Montazer X  X  paper, for instance, demonstrates the use of a fuzzy ontology in combination with intelligent agents and real-time content-based image processing to provide intelligent decision support in traffic control situations. Esposito and De Pietro also show that combining ontology with fuzzy logic formalisms can provide both a semantically rich description of a domain of interest and reasoning with uncertainty and/or vagueness. Their application area is the diagnosis and monitoring of Multiple Sclerosis using expert knowledge and MR brain images.
Semantic-based reasoning is at the center of the research conducted by several teams. For example, Colucci et al. have developed a reasoning technique for human resource manage-ment within organizations, which uses description logic and semantic annotations. Blanco-Fernandez et al. base their filtering strategies on semantic reasoning techniques that discover rele-vant relationships between user X  X  preferences and commercial products, and model user X  X  potential degree of interest in each type of product with regard to time (e.g. purchase times or dates associated with marketing events). Jabrouni et al. use logic-based semantics in conceptual graphs to retrieve knowledge accumu-lated in previous projects.

Semantic integration, information interchange and semantic interoperability are in the focus of several papers. The semantic model for actions and events in Ambient Intelligence by Santofi-mia et al. facilitates not only modeling of events and reasoning about them but also generates behavioral responses to those events and composes new services when those available do not support the expected functionality. Ubiquitous and urban com-puting is in the focus of the work by Jimenez-Molina and Ko who have developed a task-oriented framework for providing seman-tic services in urban environments. Their paper also contributes a set of metrics based on social, spatial and temporal aspects, which is used as a measure of semantic interoperability and a means for detecting possible conflicts between the task and the delivered content. Semantic interoperability in multi-agent systems with heterogeneous reputation models is explored by Nardin et al. who use a service-oriented architecture to map different reputation models, represented as ontologies. Multi-agent systems are also discussed by Galitsky et al. who explore human behavior, multi-agent interaction and the plausibility of explanations in inter-human conflicts by representing complaints scenarios using graphs and machine learning techniques. Qian et al. propose a P2P publish/subscribe system, which manages and routes com-posite events and subscriptions by using semantic brokering, a composite event and subscription language and distributed man-agement. The problem of designing efficient knowledge bases in rule-based systems with uncertainty is addressed by Jankowska. The knowledge is acquired from data stored in different reposi-tories and then aggregated through semantic data integration.
Production rules are generated using machine learning techni-ques and then verified for consistency and redundancy.
Methodological aspects of developing intelligent applications based on semantic web services are explored by Barros et al. who have based their case study on intelligent tutoring and e-learning.
Their methodology highlights the following steps in the develop-ment process: domain and services specification, development of services, definition of a repository of services, development of discovery and invocation mechanisms, and technology integration. Semantic text mining is a focal point of several papers.
Iwashita et al. use semantic analysis to extract related terms from customers X  enquiries and classify large amount of unstruc-tured text into patterns. Wang and Cheung employ semantic text mining for processing and analyzing patents. They argue that rather than using predefined ontologies built by domain experts, semantic algorithms should be used to extract the key concepts and the relations among them from the patents analyzed. Chan et al. propose a feature vector model which is used to represents each patient X  X  electronic health record along a vector of diseases mapped to a medical ontology. Velasquez et al. propose a methodology for extracting significant objects from the semantic web representations of web sites.

Application domains represented in the Special Issue include manufacturing (Vegetti et al.), transportation (Keyarsalan and Montazer, Jabrouni et al.), urban computing (Jimenez-Molina and
Ko), telecommunications (Iwashita et al.), clinical decision support (Esposito and De Pietro, Trzupek et al., Chan et al.), e-learning and tutoring (Barros et al.), knowledge management (Colucci et al.,
Jabrouni et al., Wang and Cheung), networks (Qian et al.), geo-graphical information systems (Velasquez et al.) and e-commerce (Blanco-Fernandez et al., Nardin et al., and Galitsky et al.).
The papers in the Special Issue also discuss the benefits associated with using semantic technologies. These include: improved information management by efficient handling of product families and variants, as described by Vegetti et al., enhanced knowledge management through identifying strate-gies for efficient human resources allocation and management, as highlighted by Colucci et al., and improved intellectual property management, as demonstrated by Wang and Cheung, continuous improvement by sharing experience and expert knowledge and identifying major issues and root causes in industrial processes improvement, as indicated by Jabrouni et al., better medical diagnosis via more accurate interpretation of medical evidence, as emphasized by Trzupek et al. and
Esposito and De Pietro, better services through providing personalized shopping experience as shown by Blanco-Fernandez et al., task-oriented services in urban environments as demonstrated by Jimenez-Molina and Ko, more efficient P2P network as proposed by
Qian et al., and improved customer satisfaction through better complaints management as highlighted by Galitsky et al. and faster response to customers X  enquiries as shown by Iwashita et al.
