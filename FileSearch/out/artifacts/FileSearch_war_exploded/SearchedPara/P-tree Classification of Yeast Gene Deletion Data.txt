 SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 108 Geno mics data has many prop erti es that make it different from "typical" relation al data. The presence of multi -valued attribu tes as well as the large nu mber of nu ll values led u s to a P -tree -based bit -vector r epresentation in which matching 1 -values were coun ted to evaluate similarity b etween genes. Quantitative information such as the nu mber of interaction s was also includ ed in the c lassifier. Interaction information allowed u s to extend the kno wn p rop erties of on e protein with information on its interacting neighbo rs. Different featur e a ttribu tes were weighted ind epend ently. Relevance of different attribu tes was systematically evaluated throu gh op timization o f weights using a genetic a lgorithm. The AROC value for the c lassified list was used as the fitness fun ction for the genetic a lgo rithm. P -tree, Data mining, Genetic Algorithm, Geno mics, Bioinformatics. Geno mics data po ses many challenges and requ ires s mart data mining techn iqu es to un ravel t he secrets. The data mining competiti on h eld in con jun ction with the Eighth ACM SIGKDD Internation al Con ference on Kno wledge Discovery and Data Mining [1] was based on geno mics data that had many interesting aspects s uch as multi -valued attribu tes, many nu ll values, hierarchies within the a ttribu tes, a repo sitory of un struc tured information in the form of abstracts, an interaction table that introdu ces graph -like c onn ectivity, and a very small prob abilit y of the c lass label "po sitive" (1.3% and 2 .8% respectively). These prop erties are no t comm on ly found in stand ard d ata set s s uch as the majority of tho se in the UCI Machine Learning Repo sitory [8]. We acc oun ted for multi -valued attribu tes and nu ll values by using a P -tree -based [2,3,5,6] bit -vector app roach, in which the presence of a particular attribu te value was represente d as a 1 -bit. In this representation "un kno wn" is equ ivalent to the a bsence of a meaningful attribu te value. Hierarchies were represented as separate a ttribu tes. Matches in d ifferent l evels were thereby treated as multiple matches. Conn ectivity informat ion p rovided b y the interaction information was also u sed. The small prob abilit y of class label "po sitive" meant that acc uracy was no t a good measure of the qu ality of classification . Instead we followed the e xample of Dr. Mark Craven, using AROC characte ristic to op timize the performance of ou r algorithm [7]. As the first step, we pre -processed the data to acc oun t for redund ancies and to integrate information from the a bstracts. An example of redund ancy was that localization informa tion o ccurred in bo th the sub -cellular localization (sub -hierarchy of the fun ction -hierarchy) and in the localization attribu te. We e xtracted sub -cellular localization from the fun ction h ierarchy. We found that t reating it as a separate hierarchy, thu s as an add ition al feature of the genes improved results. It is impo rtant to no te that ou r algorithm do es no t requ ire us to d ecide on the impo rtance of the features. Other data c leaning efforts includ ed recognizing "fun ction un kno wn" entries as equ ivalent to mi ssing information , and identifying dup licate names in lower levels of different hierarchies as distinct.
 We generated add ition al features from abstracts based on ob servation s made while c lassifying and also b ased on the nature of the e xperiments from which the data was derived. Relevance of these a dd ition al features was determined throu gh the op timization step o f ou r mod el. We no t on ly includ ed the prop erties of the genes that were to b e c lassified in ou r stud y, bu t also investigated prop erties of genes to which an interaction exists. A succe ssful example of such an ind irect feature is the interaction s with the essential (lethal) genes. Based on the nature of the task, essential genes cou ld no t, themselves, be c hange/con trol genes. Yet an interaction with these genes did ind icate a n increased likelihood of change/con trol. The inpu t data was con verted to P -trees [2,3,5,6]. P -trees are a lossless, compressed, and d ata -mining -ready data structure. This data structure has been succe ssfully app lied in d ata mining app lication s ranging from Classification and Clustering with K -Nearest Neighbo r, to Classification with Decision Tree Indu ction , to Association Rule Mining [2,3,5]. A basic P -tree represents on e attribu te bit t hat is reorgan ized into a tree structure by recursively sub -dividing, while recording the predicate truth value regarding pu rity for eac h d ivision . Each level of the tree c on tains truth -bits that represent pu re sub -trees and can then b e used for fast compu tation o f coun ts. This con struction is con tinu ed recursively do wn eac h tree path un til a pu re sub -division is reac hed that is entirely pu re (which may or may no t be a t the leaf level). The basic a nd complement P -trees are c ombined u sing boo lean algebra op eration s to p ro du ce P -trees for values, entire tup les, value intervals, or any other attribu te pattern. The roo t coun t of any pattern tree will i nd icate the occurrence c oun t of that pattern. The P -tree data structure provides the perfect structure for coun ting patterns i n an efficient mann er. The data representation can b e c on ceptualized as a flat table in which eac h row is a bit vector con taining a bit for eac h attribu te of eac h gene. Representing eac h attribu te bit as a basic P -tree generates a c ompressed form of this flat t able. Hierarchical information is represented u sing a separate set of attribu te bit columns for eac h level. For example to represent the information for protein -class we used 23 sets of bit columns at the highest level.  X  X olecular chaperon e X  a t the h ighest level of the protein class hierarchy requ ires 15 b it columns to recursively identify all po ssible ca tegorical attribu tes within 2 sub -levels. Experimental SIGKDD Exploration s. Volume 4, Issue 2  X  page 109 class labels  X  X hange, X   X  X  on trol, X  a nd the other binary attribu tes such as  X  X ethal gene X  were e ach encod ed in a single bit column. Protein -interaction was encod ed u sing a bit column for eac h po ssible gene in the data set, where the e xistence of an interaction with that particular gene was ind icated with a truth b it. Similarity -base d classification method s are a generalization o f minimal distance method s, which form the basis of several machine learning and p attern recognition method s. Classification succe ss depend s on adaptive parameters and p rocedu res used in the c on struction o f t he c lassification mod el. AROC evaluation requ ires genes to b e ordered b y their likelihood o f being classified into a particular partiti on . Gene similarity and gene impo rtance were qu antified to rank -order the list of test genes. Gene similarity was qu antif ied b ased on a weighted sum of matching features. We qu antify similarity of a particular test gene with the c ollection o f training g enes in that particular partiti on (for example  X  X  hange X ) withou t regard to similarity level t o the rest of the partiti on ( X  X  on trol X  or  X  X o change X ). The distribu tion o f attribu te values for change genes s uggested that no t on ly was s imilarity to a c hange gene a n ind ication o f change, bu t the fact that a gene had any listed fun ction . This leads to the c on cept of impo rtance a s an attribu te. Impo rtance of a gene was calculated acc ording to the coun t of the nu mber of prop erty attribu tes available for that particular gene, total nu mber of interaction s and the nu mber of interaction s with lethal genes. The following equ ation s s umm ariz e the c ompu tation , where Rc : roo t -coun t, W : weight, P x :P -tree for attribu te x, Atr : attribu te coun t, ptn : class -partiti on , Im : gene -impo rtance, Lth : lethal gene, g : test gene to b e c lassified, f : feature, ClassEvl : evaluated value for classification ,  X   X  : P -tree AND op erator. For eac h feature a ttribu te of eac h test gene, g , the c oun t of matching features for the requ ired p artiti on was ob tained from the roo t -coun t by AND ing the respective P -trees. We ca n ob tain the nu mber of lethal genes interacting with a particular gene, g , with on e P -tree AND op eration . It is po ssible to retrieve the requ ired coun ts withou t a database scan du e to vertical partiti on ing. Due to the diversity of the e xperimental class label and the nature of the a tt ribu te data, we need a c lassifier that wou ld no t requ ire a fixed impo rtance measure on its features, i.e., we needed an adaptable mechanism to arrive a t the best po ssible c lassifier. In ou r app roach we op timize (column b ased scaling) the weight space , W , w ith a stand ard Genetic Algorithm (GA ) [4]. The set of weights on the features represented the solution space that was encod ed for the GA . The AROC value of the c lassified list was used as the GA fitness evaluator in the search for an op timal solution . This work resulted in bo th b iological and d ata mining related insights. The systematic a nalysis of the relevance of different attribu tes is essential for a succe ssful classification . We found that the fun ction o f a protein d id no t help to classify the hidd en system. Sub -cellular localization , which is a sub -hierarchy of the fun ction h ierarchy, on the other hand , con tribu ted significantly. Furthermore, it was interesting to no te that qu antitative information , such as the nu mber of interac tion s, played a significant role. The fact that a protein h as many interaction s may suggest that the deletion o f the c orrespond ing g ene wou ld cause changes to many biological processes. Alternatively it cou ld b e that a high nu mber of listed interaction s is an ind ication o f the fact that previou s researchers have c on sidered the gene impo rtant and that it t herefore is more likely to b e involved in further experiments. For the pu rpo se of classification we did no t have to distinguish b etween these a lternativ es.
 In summ ary we found that ou r systematic weighting app roach and P -tree representation allowed u s to evaluate the relevance of a rich variety of attribu tes. This includ ed attribu tes we ob tained in relation al form as well as attribu tes we derived from abs tracts, throu gh coun ting, and as prop erties of attribu tes that cou ld b e reac hed throu gh interaction s.
