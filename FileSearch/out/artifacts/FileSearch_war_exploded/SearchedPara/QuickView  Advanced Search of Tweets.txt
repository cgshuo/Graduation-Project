With tweets being a comprehensive repository for super fresh information, tweet search becomes increasingly popu-lar. However, existing tweet search services, e.g., Twitter 1 , offer only simple keyword based search. Owing to the noisy and informal nature of tweets, the returned list does not contain meaningful information in many cases.

This demonstration introduces QuickView , an advanced tweet search service to address this issue. It adopts a series of natural language processing technologies to extract useful information from a large volume of tweets. Specifically, for each tweet, it first conducts tweet normalization, followed by named entity recognition(NER). Our NER component is a combination of a k-nearest neighbors(KNN) classifier (to collect global information across recently labeled tweets) with a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) labeler (to exploit information from a single tweet and the gazetteers). Then it extracts opinions (e.g., positive or negative comments about a product). After that it conducts semantic role la-beling(SRL) to get predicate-argument structures(e.g.,verbs and their agents or patients), which are further converted into events (i.e., triples of who did what). We follow Liu et al. [1] to construct our SRL component. Next, tweets are classified into predefined categories. Finally, non-noisy tweets together with the mined information are indexed.
On top of the index, QuickView enables the following two brand new scenarios, allowing users to effectively access their interested tweets or fine-grained information mined from tweets.
 Categorized Browsing . As illustrated in Figure 1(a), QuickView shows recent popular tweets, entities, events, opinions and so on, which are organized by categories. It also extracts and classifies URL links in tweets to allow users h ttp://twitter.com/
