 Spoken Web is an alternative Web for low-literacy users in the developing world. People can create audio content over phone and share on the Spoken Web. This enables easy creation of locally relevant content. Even on the World Wide Web in developed regions, the recent increase in trac is due to the locally relevant content created on social networking sites. This paper argues that content search and ranking in the new scenario needs a re-look. The generic model of using in-links for ranking such content is not an appropriate measure of the content relevance in such a collaborative Web 2.0 world.
 This paper aims to bring the social context in Spoken Web ranking. We formulate a relationship function between the query-creator and the content-creator and use this as one measure of the content relevance to the user. The rela-tionship function uses the geographical location of the two people and their prior browsing preferences as parameters to determine the relationship between the two users. Fur-ther we also determine the trustability of the content based on the content creators acceptance measure by the social network. We use these two features in addition to the term-frequency|inverse-term-frequency match to rank the search results in context of the social network of the query-creator and provide a more speci c and socially relevant result to the user.

Content search on the World Wide Web involves retrieval of documents that contain the query terms. With more than 20 billion pages now available on the Web [8], for any given query, there are usually a large number of documents that can contain the query terms. Therefore content ranking plays a critical role in determining the set of few most likely documents that can provide the user with the required con-tent. Content ranking on the Web has been dominated by the in-links which use the link structure of the Web to de-termine the importance of the content [16]. The underlying assumption in such an approach is that the most relevant content will be referenced by a maximum number of web pages. The second factor that determines the importance of the content, which is somewhat related to page ranks, is the trust that people have on the site that hosts the content. As Web users gain understanding of the di erent sites, they tend to trust content from some sites more than from other sites. As an example, a news story on CNN may be trusted more as compared to the same news on a politician's blog.
However the Web has evolved signi cantly over the last couple of years, with the increase in user generated con-tent [4]. Social groups now create a large amount of content that is usually relevant mostly across a a speci c group of people. This paper contends that the interpretations of im-portant content needs a relook in this Web 2.0 world. We focus on the content that is local to a particular group of users who know each other in real life. In such contexts, the real-world social structure of the relationships between people is likely to have an in uence on the importance of the content that is created or consumed in the group. We claim that the relationship between the query-creator and the content-creator plays a signi cant role in the content relevance to the user, and therefore in the content ranking for such a community. Further, we establish that the trust on a particular content is also linked to the trust that the community has on the content-creator. We use these two features to introduce the concept of social ranking for con-tent search. While there could be di erent data sets on the World wide Web to which these social concepts can be applied to rank the content, we speci cally focus on users in the developing regions as the community to validate the claims presented above. R ural developing world represents 58% of the to-tal world population and the Internet penetration in such regions is estimated to be below 2% . L ow literacy and low Internet penetration, coupled with the increasing phone pen-etration in these geographies suggest that phone and voice could be better means of content creation and access. L ow literacy forces these users to create and access such locally relevant content in audio rather than textual means.
The World Wide Telecom Web (or Spoken Web) [14, 13, 17 ] is a system that leverages the pervasiveness of mobile phones in developing countries and allows the creation, de-ployment and hosting of voice-driven applications called V oic-eSites by any phone subscriber. It attempts to empower users by giving them the opportunity to become content cre-ators and provides a mechanism for users to access informa-tion and content with a ordable devices (just a regular tele-phone). B eing a voice-driven system, it extends the access to ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies) to illiterate users. M any users in the developing world are now creating and accessing information through the Spoken Web platform. The content ranges from information about peo-ple and events in a village [1] to information about the crop prices in the market [2], to business information for the un-organiz ed workforce in developing regions [13].

However, e ectively searching through V oiceSites on a voice user interface for navigation and browsing poses sig-ni cant challenges for Spoken Web. Searching and browsing problems are exacerbated by the audio modality of the con-tent and interaction. Audio is a sequential interface and so presentation of the search results is a non-trivial translation from the visual Web world. As an example, even if the sys-tem returns 10 search results, each with 5 second of audio, it will take about one minute for the user to listen to all the search results. G iven the nuances of the audio interface, content ranking plays an even more critical role . The second motivation to perform social ranking for the Spoken Web is derived from the demographics of the users. The low-literate population in rural regions usually has very local information needs [1]. In most cases, the users have a real-world relationships with each other and have a con-cept of trusting speci c people in the community. When a technology is introduced to such a population, its adoption is determined by how the social structure is folded in it. T he demographics of such users would therefore desire that content importance and trust be derived from the real-world social structure.
This paper introduces the concepts of using the social structure of the community to perform content ranking on the Spoken Web. We illustrate the high level approach of our solution using the Figure 1. The gure uses the analogy with the page ranks concept that is used in the world wide web. There are two main entities considered by the social ranking system. First is the query-creator and the second is the content-creator. The relationship between the query cre-ator and the content creator is used to in uence the ranking F ig ure 1 : W hile the current w eb search uses (a) pag e rank s and exploits the link relationship across con-tent , (b ) the social rank uses the relationship across people w ho create and seek the content. of the content with respect to the query. In this paper, this high-level concept is realiz ed by speci cally focusing on the Spoken Web content and users. This determines the scope of the concept and the context in which the work presented in this paper has been performed. G iven this scope, following are the key contributions of this paper:
The paper organiz ation follows a standard structure of rst presenting the related research in the eld (Section 3). We then describe the data set and the users (Section 4) since we believe that the techniques can be better understood once the reader has an idea of the data and the user environment. Then we present the method used to determine the two key pieces that are used in ranking: similarity across users and social status of a the content creator (Section 5). We then provide a ranking algorithm that ranks the content using the above two features (Section 6). Finally we present the experiments (Section 7 ) that demonstrate that the social information that we derive from our algorithm correlates with what the users perceive on the eld.
The problem presented in this paper and the approach have been motivated by some pioneering work in the area of spoken document retrieval, personaliz ed search and semantic search areas. In this section, we present the key publications in these areas and highlight the di erences from our work and the key ndings that we have borrowed.
Searching audio content is usually dependent on convert-ing the audio to text using a speech recogniz er and then performing the standard text based search. However the ac-curacy of speech recogniz er is not very high for spontaneous conversational speech. O ver the last ve years, researchers have started to look at searching speech not through speech recognition, but by indexing speech at a subword level [5]. Such techniques are more robust to speech recognition er-rors since they consider multiple recognition hypothesis in the index [6].

M ost systems for audio search use a visual query interface for accessing content indexed from audio. This is typical in call centers where supervisors wish to monitor o ine con-tent of the call center agents [15]. In such situations, the query interface is still visual and hence simple. In [18], the authors address this speci c problem and suggest use of di-chotic stream (one audio stream for one ear) to play back the search results. However this cannot be applied to a phone channel audio, which is not stereo. W hat di erentiates our problem is that the query interface and the content, both are in audio.
R esearchers have suggested approaches to personaliz e a search result for a particular user [7 ] or to a community [11] or for a speci c domain [9 ]. The PR O S system [7 ] uses infor-mation from the bookmarks of a particular user to determine the interest of the user with respect to his preferences in content and then users those terms to rank the content. O n the other hand, authors in [11] use the interaction network between the agents and the end-users and exploit the per-sonal relationship between them to weight the search results accordingly. community has on the agent who creates the content. Domain speci c search techniques [9 ] bene t from the collective search queries within a particular domain and use this e ective knowledge of the content preference of the community to improve the relevance of the search results within the domain. W hile all of these techniques do provide more relevant results to a particular user, they do not exploit the real-world relationships between people to in uence the search results.
M etadata has been the backbone for information retrieval in Digital L ibraries [10]. Since it is dicult to process and extract semantics from images, metadata has been the key for image search systems [20]. Not surprisingly, the meta-data based content management systems for mobiles have started to appear in the research community. The authors in [19 ] have used metadata to manage the images on a mo-bile. S emantic search therefore is focused on understanding the content in a more intelligent fashion. O n the other hand, the proposed social search has its strength on understanding the content creators in a more intelligent manner. The experiments were performed on the data set of a live V oiceSite which is used by people in the western state of india, G ujarat. There are 250 registered participants on this V oiceSite. O nly registered users are allowed to create the content and listen to it. The users of this V oiceSite are grain farmers who need to deal with agricultural issues during the growth season and would deal with commercial entities only during the end of a season so their social network comprises mostly of farmers. The NG O broadcasts a 15 minute weekly radio program about best farming practices. M ost farmers would listen to the radio program in a group and would later discuss on topics aired on the program. So the social network of the farmers already existed through the radio program. B efore we started the pilot, farmers could directly call/write to the radio station sta and get answers to their queries. However, the aim of posting their questions and answering the questions posted by others on V oiceSite was to build a persistent knowledge base that could be later reused. A farmer can always go back to the archive at any time and access the data from the knowledge base from the V oiceSite. T his provided a perfect setting for testing the social ranking concept since the social structure of the farmers was strong and therefore the baseline real-world network was available for any comparative study.

The data for performing the experiments is extracted by mining previous browsing patterns of the farmers from the Spoken Web log le. The log le captures all the user actions when a person is browsing the V oiceSite. The following ac-tions were logged: calling, listening to a question, listening to an answer posted by an expert, listening to an answer posted by a user, recording a question, recording an answer, navigating to the top-level menu, and hanging up. After recording a question or an answer, the SW updates the log le with the total length of the audio recording. Such log les are input to the social ranking system.

A total of 4827 audio documents were considered for the experiment conducted in this paper. The information re-lated to the content creators of these documents was avail-able through the log le. Additional information was avail-able in the form of structured data that consisted of the locatoin of the participants and their names and phone num-bers. This was provided to us at the time of registration. Therefore the log le, the structured demographics and the audio documents formed the data on which the experimetns were conducted.
With respect to Figure 1, this section is focused on de-termining the social structure based on the browsing logs of users in the community. M ore speci cally, we are inter-ested in determining (a) the relationship between the query creator and the content creator, and (b) the e ective com-munity trust level of the content creator. In order to use these factors for ranking in a search scenario, these relation-ships need to have a measurable value which can then be stored along with the content index. These are the main items that we present in this section.

L et U = f u 1 ; u 2 ; :::; u N g be the set of users in the com-munity. We take a speci c case of any two users in the set U , one of which is the query creator (denoted by u q ) and the other being the content creator ( u c ). The relationship between these users is denoted by R q;c . We calculate the relationship between all such N P 2 possible user pairs in U . It is to be noted that this relationship is not commutative since a user u i may consider another user u j to be close, but the reverse may not be true. Further, each user in the set is assigned a trust level, T c , which is then associated to every content that this user has created. In this section we for-maliz e the relationship between two users in the set U . The calculations can be performed for any two users to derive the relationships between all the users in the set.
We are interested in determining if a particular query cre-ator user U q considers the content of the content creator U c as important or not. O ur assumption is that if U q has listened to the content created by U c in the past, then he is perhaps an avid listener of U c . Further, our algorithm also captures the fact that if the U q and U c have listened to similar content in the past, then the two users could be considered similar and therefore should have a closer rela-tionship with each other. We de ne the distance between any two users in the community by using the above to as-sertions in Equation 1 below: where , 0 &gt; &gt; 1.

In Equation 1, the function f f measures the importance that the user u q places on any content that has been cre-ated by u c . This is determined by nding the percentage of content that u q has listened of u c as a fraction of the total content listened by u q . where L c;q is the total number of times that the user u q listened to content created by user u c . The denominator determines the total number of times that the user u q has listened to any content across all the users in the system. L c;q is computationally inexpensive as it involves counting (in the log le) the number of times that the user has lis-tened to any content and then ltering the content that was created by u c . f f looks at the entire space of content lis-tened by u q and nds the fraction of it that was created by u . B eing a fraction, f f has a lower bound of 0 (which is when the u q has never listened to content from u c ) and an upper bound of 1 (when u q has listened only to content from u ).
 O n purpose, the counting L does not remove duplication. For example if u q had listened to a speci c content more than once, that will be counted as many times. This ensures that f f captures the additional interest in the user u c listens to the same content multiple times.

In Equation 1, the function f s aims to determine the sim-ilarity between the query creator u q and the content creator u . While f f measures how much u q follows u c , f s measures how many common content do both u q and u c follow. This is calculated by nding the space of the content that is lis-tened by both u q and u c and then determining the fraction of the content that is common to both. If F q is the set of content that is listened by user u q and F c is the content that is listened by user u c , then Equation 3 de nes the function f as: the larger will be the value of f s . U nlike f f , the func-tion f s is a commutative function so that f s ( q ; s ) f Thus this function is calculated only for N C 2 value pairs in a community of N users. However f s is computationally more complex than f f since we need to determine the common elements across two sets, which has the complexity of the order of O ( N ).

After formaliz ing the f f and the f s functions, the only unknown element in Equation 1 is the value of . It deter-mines the relative weight that we give to the two functions and is derived emperically. The relationship between u q and u is therefore established by calculating R ( q ; c ) and it takes into account the browsing similarity of the two users and the relative importance that u q gives to u c .
For every content creator u c in the community, we asso-ciate a trust factor T c that determines the importance that any content of this creator should be provided. We calcu-late the value of T c by determining how many times has the community as a whole listened to the content created by u This fraction over the total listening space of the community provides the listenability of the content creator u c .
It is important to determine the importance of a user from a community perspective, in addition to nding it from the query creator perspective. The reason for this is that even if the relationship of the query creator is not good with the content creator u c , but if the community regards u c 's content important, then the search results for the query should also increase the ranking of the content created by u c who is heavily regarded in the community.
In addition to the standard index that contains the in-formation about the data, we also store the relationship in-formation R for each content. Detailed information on the Spoken Web indexed data is provided in [3]. When a query is presented to the indexer, we identify the user as well. The query term along with the identity of the user is the input to our indexer. The query term is used to generate the list of audio documents that have an association with the query. This list is then ranked based on the two measures of rela-tionship and trust to generate a nal ranked list of search results. This section presents the ranking algorithm that uses the social measures that have been described in the previous section.

We begin by de ning a social ranking S to a content c for a query q: The constant determines the amount of personaliz ation that we wish to factor in to the search results. A value of = 0 would result in completely ignoring the other users' perception of the content, while a value of = 1 will result in a completely community oriented view of the social ranking, ignoring any personal biases of the query creator.
The computation of the social rank takes the identity of the query creator and the content creator in account. If the query Q is created by u q and the content that matches the query is set C = f c 1 ; c 2 ; :::c M g where each content is created by u c i , then the social rank S ci for each content in the set C can be computed as follows: The index stores the values of R and T along with the con-tent. So once the relevant content set C that has the query terms is determined, there is an extra step of identifying the corresponding user who created this content. O nce the content creator (referred to as u ci in the above algorithm), the social rank computation is straightforward. The social rank is computed for all the documents that had the query term and then the order is sorted and the top few socially most relevant results can then be presented to the user in response to the query Q .
Section 5 propose that relationship R and trust T are ef-fective measures to capture the social structure of the com-munity that has the query creator and the content creator. However the intuition that these parameters are e ective enough to determine the social structure needs to be veri-ed. We conducted an experiment with 15 users of the sys-tem and evaluated if the algorithm scores have a correlation with what the users perceive of the social structure. The experiment was conducted in three very di erent parts. The rst part involved interviewing 15 the farmers and ask-ing them questions that lead us to derive their social struc-ture | within the context of the Spoken Web. We also had the demographics information of all the 250 users in terms of their location. The second part of the experiment was to use this demographic information in addition to the interview answers to determine the social structure in the real-world. This provided us the baseline of the social structure. The third part involved mining of 2 years of log data of the 15 query users and the 250 content users in the community to calculate the R and T scores for these 15 users.
We conducted a subjective study to determine the content preferences from 15 farmers. Their age ranged from 18 years to 49 years, with a mean of 33 years. They completed a mean of 11 years of formal education, wherein only one farmer was illiterate (though he was number literate and so could operate the basic phone features).

Following were the questions that we asked from these farmers: 1. Name the experts whose answers you value the most? 2. Which fellow farmers' questions you value the most? 3. Are you more interested in questions and answers per-4. Name the people whose questions you listen carefully? 12 farmers provided speci c names in response to the rst question. O thers did not remember the names. Except for 4 farmers, none other could suggest names of fellow farm-ers in response to question 2. M ost people had problems associating names with content, that too when asked in a spontaneous interview. 10 farmers answered the third ques-tion in an armative { which means that they were more interested in the content that is relevant to their geography. 6 farmers could provide names with respect to the last ques-tion. The 250 registered users to the system were from 18 di erent districts, which in turn spanned 18 di erent talukas (towns). This span across these many districts ensured that we had sucient variety in the social structure.
Figure 2 shows the R score for the 15 users with whom we had conducted the subjective interview. The lines against each user shows the R score calculated according to Equa-tion 1. We plot the top 5 scores against each user and this range is shown by the line. The blue colored blobs show the R scores for the names of farmers who the subjects had spoken about in the interview. Relationship 
R F ig ure 2 : T he R score plotted ag ainst w hat the farm-ers perceive as important people in the community.
In most cases, the top 5 results of the R score consists of the farmer names that were spoken. This suggests that the R score is able to determine with a high accuracy the content from the farmers which the subjects considered as important . Since some farmers did not speak out any names, there is no blob against their line. This was the case with u 5 and u 9 . However u 13 and u 15 had spoken of the farmer names that they consider as important, but the R score for those was not in the top 5 list and so there is no blob against those names. These two cases can be considered as a failure of the R measure to determine the social importance.
We calculated the community trust score T for each of the 250 farmers who are registered to the system. Figure 3 shows the T score plotted with the highest scored user being on the left, with others following towards right in the descending order of their T score. The T score for a large number of users is 0 since they never created any content and so on one ever listened to their content. Community Trust

The circled entries show the 14 people whose names came up in the subjective interview with the 15 farmers. The fact that these 14 trusted people are in the top 10% percentile of the T value suggests that Equation 4 is able to determine the community trust to a considerable extent. T he fact that the R and T scores for farmers whose names appeared in the subjective interview establishes that the measures use to derive the social structure has merits.
In this paper we introduced the concept of social ranking for the Spoken Web. It uses the real-world social structure and argues that the content that interests users is in uenced by the relationship between the content seeker and the con-tent creator. We then establish that it is possible to extract the social structure by mining the browsing history of a com-munity of users. We present an algorithm to rank content based on this structure. The social ranking technique has been e ectively applied to one particular instance of a Spo-ken Web community of 250 users that are a reasonable rep-resentation of of low-literacy users in developing countries.
Though we have developed the social ranking algorithm, its e ectiveness in a search application needs to be tested ex-tensively. Further, we will have to compare the social rank-ing technique with another standard baseline technique such as the page rank and derive relative improvements. However the initial results reported in the paper clearly establish the importance of the concepts of social ranking in the context of Spoken Web. [1] S. Agarwal, A. K umar, A. A.
