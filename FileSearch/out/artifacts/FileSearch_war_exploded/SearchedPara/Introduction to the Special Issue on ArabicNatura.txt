 K. SHAALAN The British University in Dubai and A. FARGHALY Monterey Institute of International Studies OVERVIEW OF THE ARTICLES This special issue is dedicated to the reporting of the recent Arabic natural lan-guage processing advances. A special issue of a journal allows, of course, only a partial representation of the current development in a field. However, we be-lieve that the articles in this special issue are representative of at least some Arabic natural language processing fields. The following is a brief summary of each of the main articles in this issue. Farghaly and Khaled Shaalan, introduces an account of challenges and so-lutions to significant issues in Arabic natural language processing. It covers many aspects of Arabic that are import ant to know by different researchers of Arabic language processing, such as Arabic diglossia, the levels (morpheme, word, syntax) of studying the Arabic language, non-concatenative morphology, and the agglutinative nature of the word structure, etc. Cristina Espana-Bonet, Jesus Gimenez, and Lluis Marquez, presents an Arabic-to-English machine translation system that follows the phrased-based statistical translation architecture . The accuracy of the translation is in-creased by training the classifier on phrase selection using linguistic and context information. The evaluation shows an improvement at the lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels. It is also concluded that the classifier has re-solved some semantic ambiguities of Arabic. tion, X  by Yassine Benajiba and Imed Zitouni, describes the importance of word segmentation as an initial step for Arabic language processing. An evalua-tion of Arabic mention detection models using different segmentation schemes shows a better performance, especially when Arabic Treebank and morpholog-ical segmentations are combined. Imed Zitouni and Radu Florian, presents an approach that tries to overcome the unavailability of Arabic linguistic resources for some applications, such as mention detection, by propagating info rmation from a resou rce-rich language. The approach is applied using a mention detection system and statistical machine translation system that translates text from English to Arabic. The result of experiments shows improvement in the Arabic mention detection sys-tem performance.  X  X utomatic Speech-to-Text Transcription in Arabic, X  by Lori Lamel, Abdelkhalek Messaoudi, and Jean-Luc Gauvain Limsi-Cnrs, reports on re-search carried out over the last few years on the incremental improvements to a system for the automatic speech-to-text transcription of broadcast data in Arabic. Arabic texts are written without di acritics, yet the diacritics provide useful information for pronunciation modeling and higher level processing. So rules to generate pronunciations with a generic vowel have been proposed, and this method has been used to significantly facilitate training on nonvo-calized data. The results show that the explicit modeling of gemination and the introduction of pronunciation variants led to significant improvements in speech-to-text transcription performance.  X  X ura Length and Lexical Probability Estimation in Cluster Analysis of the Qur X  X n, X  by Hermann Moisl, addresses the problem of clustering of the shorter suras in order to generate their accurate classifications. It proposes a solution of the problems found in a previous work to the reanalysis of the Qur X  X n. We are very pleased with the response we received to our call for contributions from the research community in the field. We received 29 submissions to this special issue and accepted five. We would like to thank all those who submitted articles for this special issue. Space and time limitations caused the exclusion of some good articles.
