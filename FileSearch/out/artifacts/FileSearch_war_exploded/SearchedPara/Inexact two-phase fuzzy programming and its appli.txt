 1. Introduction
Environmental protection and resources conservation continue to be challenges faced by solid waste managers in public and private sectors ( Chan and Huang, 2003 ; Lu et al., 2008 ; Cheng et al., 2003a ; He et al., 2008 ; He et al., 2011a , 2011b ). These challenges become more aggravated with the raises of population, arising from which waste generation rates are intensively increased. The multidisciplinary system design of MSW treatment facilities has thus been deemed critical and obtains a number of attentions of the researchers ( Luo and Huang, 1997 ; Cheng et al., 2003b ; Xi et al., 2010 ).

Anderson (1968) first conducted economic optimization for the planning of a solid-waste-management system. Afterwards, a number of mathematical efforts were made to solve various solid waste management problems ( Jenkins, 1982 ; Baetz, 1990 ; Lund, 1994 ; Chang and Wang, 1997 ; Joghataie and Allahverdipur, 2004 ; world practices have been widely concerned, leading to the development of many inexact programming methods for plan-ning MSW management systems. For example, Chi and Huang (1998) developed an interval-parameter mixed-integer linear programming model for the regional MSW management in the City of Regina. The model can be used to handle the uncertainties existing in the left-hand-side coefficients and the problems of capacity expansion for MSW treatment facilities. Sae-Lim (1999) proposed an inexact fuzzy-stochastic mixed-integer linear programming method for the planning of waste management. This method allowed for system constraints to be violated to a certain extent. He et al. (2008) studied an inexact bi-infinite programming method for sizing, timing, and sitting the facilities X  expansion of a MSW management system; the method was then advanced to semi-infinite programming with an application to (2009) advanced an inexact dynamic optimization model for supporting solid waste management in association with GHG emission control. He et al. (2009) provided an inexact integer model containing infinite objectives and constraints for regional solid waste management problems.

The above methods have been used in both hypothetical and real cases, and presented effectiveness in reflecting uncertainties. However, when compromised management strategies are accep-table for decision makers, these approaches become inefficient. Fuzzy flexible programming, as an effective means in handling such problems has been introduced into the modeling frame-one control variable was mostly adopted to relax the constraints, such that the solutions spaces were curtailed when many constraints may be less relaxed (corresponding to a high satisfac-tory level) to obtain optimal solutions. In 1999, Guua and Wu first proposed a two-phase fuzzy programming approach which incor-porated multiple control variables in the solution procedure.
It can be noted as a helpful supplementation to conventional fuzzy programming and was then applied to solve various problems. For example, Ar X kan and G  X  ung  X  or (2007) proposed a two-phase approach for multi-objective programming problems with fuzzy coefficients. Kahraman et al. (2007) introduced a two-phase multi-attribute decision-making approach for new product introduction. Dog  X  an et al. (2008) used two-phase possibilistic linear programming methodology for multi-objective supplier evaluation and order allocation problems. Lu et al. (2010) advanced a two-phase flexible optimization model based on inexact air dispersion simulation for regional air quality control.
However, no efforts were found to use the two-phase fuzzy programming approach in solving solid waste management problems.

Therefore, this study aims to develop an inexact two-phase fuzzy programming (ITFP) approach for planning MSW manage-ment, wherein multiple control variables exist to make different relaxation levels to the objective function and constraints. Mixed-integer programming and interval-parameter programming will also be communicated into the modeling framework to plan expansion engineering and deal with parameter uncertainty. A case study will also be investigated to demonstrate the perfor-mance of the approach. 2. Modeling formulation
Consider a MSW management system, wherein one landfilling and two waste-to-energy (WTE) facilities exist for serving the disposal need of three MSW generation sources over a 15-year planning horizon (with three 5-year periods). Two options are residues to the landfill for terminal disposal. Within the planning horizon, waste generation rates of the sources will instantly increase, leading to a shortage of facilities X  capacity. Thus, how to plan the expansion engineering is another major concern. The decision maker wants to obtain a compromised allocation strategy with satisfactory system cost under an acceptable reliability level.
Meanwhile, the key restrictions that significantly affect the system performance need to be specified. Therefore, the problem can be handled through identifying an optimal allocation scheme with a minimum system cost under a number of environmental, mass-balance, and infrastructural constraints: [Objective function]: min f [Constraints]:
Mass-balance constraints : There should be a balance of waste flows from the source location to the destination. We can interpret such constraints by the following formula: x
Capacity constraints : For the landfill, the total allocated waste flow cannot exceed the sum of its total capacity of both new and existing landfills. Similarly, the total waste flow to each WTE cannot exceed the sum of its daily capacity of both new and existing facilities. These can be described as follows: 0 @ x ijk r WTE
Non-negative and integer constraints : These are the constraints on the range of allowable values for the variables in the model.
For MSW management problems, the constraints mean all deci-sion variables are positive, and all integer variables equal either 0or1: x
Z 0  X  1e  X 
Y  X  where f  X  system cost; i  X  index for waste generation sources; and 3 for WTE facilities 1 and 2, respectively); k  X  index for planning periods; p  X  index for facility expansion options;
OC  X  operation cost of facility j in period k ; TC jk  X  transportation cost of shipping wastes from source i to facility j in period k ; x  X  waste stream from source i to facility j in period k ; RF  X  wastes disposed by WTE j in period k ; LAN  X  existing capacity of source i in period k ; subscript  X  X  7  X  X  indicates the corresponding parameter/decision variable is interval-valued with identified lower and upper bounds. In this model, interval parameters are incorporated to present uncertain inputs when the information of many parameters cannot be identified due to practical reasons.
Correspondingly, the solutions obtained from this model will also present interval feature according to the solution method for interval programming problems proposed by Huang et al. (1993) .
Such solutions can offer more conveniences to decision makers with the provision of multiple alternatives. Considering the characteristics of most MSW systems, we identified waste generation rate, facility capacities, and economic-related para-meters being intervals in this study.

Apparently, the above model can deal with parameter uncer-tainty associated with modeling inputs. However, when fuzzy relations also exist between the modeling objective and con-straints, enhanced techniques need to be introduced. Therefore, in this study, the above model (model 1) is further converted to an enhanced model based on the two-phase fuzzy programming approach ( Guua and Wu, 1999 ). Through introducing a max X  X in operator l 7 , model (1) is first rewritten to the following phase-I problem: max l 7  X  2a  X  subject to  X  r f  X  X  1 l 7  X  X  f  X  f  X  2b  X   X  x ijk Z 0  X  2f  X 
Y jpk  X  binary variable  X  2g  X  0 r l 7 r 1  X  2h  X  where f and f  X  are lower and upper bounds of the objective X  X  aspiration level as designated by decision makers, respectively.
The introduction of max X  X in operator l 7 makes it possible in generating a compromised solution under an acceptable satisfac-tory level (always lower than 100%). However, as a max X  X in operator, variable l 7 performs its associated characteristics of being the minimum value among the maximized relaxation condition to each constraint. Under this circumstance, the objec-tive function and all constraints are relaxed under the same level.
As this level will be the most stringent among those for all constraints, solutions obtained from this approach would not be satisfactory enough, since many larger l 7 values might be discarded. In response to this concern, multiple control operators (MCO) corresponding to every constraint are proposed in this study. As the solving procedure for such MCO-involved model can be generalized into two phases, such integrated model is thus named as inexact two-phase fuzzy programming (ITFP). In detail, solutions corresponding to an optimal global maxi X  X in operator ( l opt ) would be firstly generated in Phase I. By restricting all l objective function and all constraints can be then optimized in
Phase II. In this approach, the objective function and each constraint are separately relaxed under different l 7 j levels, such that the solutions would be much efficient in terms of more constrained resources being utilized ( Guua and Wu, 1999 ).
Consequently, the second-phase model can be formulated as follows: max subject to:  X   X   X  j  X  2 , 3  X  X  n  X  11 and 12  X  X  3m ; n  X  x ijk Z 0  X  3o  X  Y jpk  X  binary variable  X  3p  X  l
As both the parameters and decision variables are interval, the conventional solution method for interval-parameter program-ming can be effective for solving the above model. Summarily, it can be generalized as follows: [Step 1]: Divide model (2) to two interactive submodels with [Step 3]: Incorporate constraints l r l  X  opt and x  X  ijk [Step 4]: Solve the second submodel and obtain the solutions of [Step 5]: Formulate the upper-bound submodel of model (3), and [Step 6]: Solve the above model and obtain the solutions [Step 7]: Incorporate constraints l opt r l n r l  X  nopt and x  X  [Step 8]: Solve the above model and obtain the solutions of l [Step 9]: Calculate the value of f 7 opt through: f 7 opt 3. Case study 3.1. Overview of the study system
A MSW manager is responsible for allocating the wastes generated from three cities to three treatment/disposal facilities, including one landfilling and two WTE facilities as illustrated in Fig. 1 . The planning horizon is 15 years, which are further divided equally into three periods. Waste generation rates of the cities, operation costs of the facilities, and transportation costs for shipping wastes from the cities to the facilities and delivering residues from WTE to landfill are provided in Tables 1 to 3 . The existing disposal capacities are [100, 125] and [200, 225] tonnes/day for WTEs 1 and 2, as well as [6.25, 7.75] 10 5 landfill; however, these will be insufficient for satisfying the increasing treatment/disposal demands. For expanding the facil-ities, one and three options are respectively available for the landfilling and WTE facilities, with the detailed expansion infor-mation shown in Table 4 . In association with the wastes being incinerated, [20, 30] % (on a mass basis) of the inflow wastes are remained that need to be further landfilled. Revenues would be generated through energy recovery with a rate of $ [15.0, 25.0] per tonne, and thus taken into the system benefit account.
In this problem, waste generation rates, facility capacities, and economic data related to op eration, transp ortation and expansion show uncertain features in terms of real-world practical condition s, and are characterized as intervals. The objective is to minimize the system cost, consisting of opera-tion, transportation and expa nsion costs minus the benefits from energy recovery; while the constraints include a variety of infrastructural, mass-balan ce, and technical restrictions.
The approach developed in Section 2 is applied to this study for generating optimal allocation strategies, and interpreting key factors that may significantly affect the system perfor-mance. The solutions can be obtained based on the solving procedure presented in Section 2 , and then analyzed in the following sections. 3.2. Result analysis
Table 5 presents the solutions of model (3). It is observed that the solutions for the objective function value and most of non-zero decision variables are intervals, which implies that the solutions would be sensitive to the uncertain modeling inputs.
Due to the temporal and spatial variations of management conditions, the waste-flow allocation patterns would vary depending upon the time periods.

As shown in Table 5 , most of the wastes from cities 1 and 2 are treated and/or disposed by one technique, while those from city 3 need two or more facilities. For example, in period 1, all wastes generated from city 1 (or city 2) would be shipped to WTE 2 (or landfill) for disposal; in comparison, those from city 3 would be deliveredtobothWTE2andWTE1,withrespectivesharesof96.0 and 4.0%, approximately. In period 2, most of the wastes from city 1 and all wastes from city 2 would be respectively hauled to WTE 1 and landfill; while all wastes from city 3 would be combusted by two WTE facilities. In period 3, incinerating in WTE 1 (or land-filling) would be the only option for disposing the wastes from city amounts of 53.78, [0, 9.80], and [277.72, 301.62] tonnes/day for landfill, WTE 1, and WTE 2, respectively. In summary, incinerating in WTE 1 is the predominant disposal measure for the wastes from city 3, however, landfilling should be avoided in the first two
The solutions of integer variables for facilities expansion can also be obtained, and the resulting available capacities in the three planning periods are presented in Fig. 2 a. As waste genera-tion rates will be increased temporally, capacities of the disposal facilities need to be enlarged for satisfying the system demand although more infrastructural costs have to be paid. According to the optimization, all three facilities are suggested to be expanded
WTE 2. After these expansions, the total capacities available for disposing wastes would be sufficient in relation to the high generation rates in period 3.

Dissimilar to conventional fuzzy linear programming where only one control variable exists, the developed two-phase approach proposes MCO for both objective function and constraints, and defines the reformulated objective as to max-imize the sum of MCO. In this case study, the optimal value of objective function is [3.733, 10.779], in association with an optimal system cost of $ [335.14, 500.61] 10 6 . The values of l nopt indicate the reliability of satisfying the related constraints. The upper-bound l 7 nopt corresponds to an optimistic strategy where the values of both objective function (i.e. system cost) and decision variables reach their lower bounds, such that a system cost associated with relatively low costs but high benefits can be obtained. On the contrary, a high system cost may need to be paid under a conservative condition, when the upper bounds of cost rates and the lower bounds of benefit rates are imposed. The actual decision alternatives could be identified through varying the value of l 7 nopt between their lower and upper bounds.
The problem can also be solved through conventional inexact fuzzy linear programming (IFLP) in which only one control variable exists to relax the objective function and all constraints. The solutions from IFLP are listed in Table 5 . Apparently, most of the optimized values for decision variables are different from those in ITFP, but the tendency of allocation patterns is similar.
Take city 3 as an example. The major treatment facility according to both ITFP and IFLP is WTE 2 over the planning horizon; however, the specific treatment amounts vary with the program-ming approaches. Such differences are resulted from the different relaxation conditions in the two models. According to fuzzy flexible programming, constraint-violating risks exist within an acceptable level, which means the optimized allocation patterns may not always fully satisfy the constraints. When inputting the solutions from either IFLP or ITFP to the original model, several constraints may be violated. For instance, the sum of wastes allocated to the three treatment/disposal facilities from city 1 is [206.50, 240.20] tonnes/day in ITFP and [206.48, 246.08] tonnes/ day in IFLP, both of which are lower than the wastes generation rate (i.e. [200, 250] tonnes/day) in period 1. This demonstrates that the mass-balance constraint is violated. However, this viola-tion is acceptable to the decision maker under a satisfactory level of [0.130, 0.804], as a low system cost will be associated with this risk being accepted.
 The facility-expansion patterns can also be obtained through
IFLP (as shown in Fig. 2 b). Although the same conclusion that all three expansion engineering need to be conducted before period 1 is indicated as that from ITFP, the suggested options are different. Compare to a 200 t/day expansion plan (option 3) for
WTE 1 suggested by ITFP, a 100 t/day expansion plan (option 1) is much preferable in IFLP. Similarly, WTE 2 should be expanded to 375 t/day from IFLP rather than 325 t/day from ITFP. This varia-tion is caused by the introduction of MCO. Although the suggested expansion patterns by the two models are different, the total tonnes/day of incinerating capacity.

The objective function value of ITFP (i.e. P 12 n  X  0 l 7 is larger than the objective function value of IFLP (i.e. l 0.804]). This implies that the ITFP solutions would be more reliable than the IFLP ones. The optimal system cost is $ [305.91, 554.56] 10 6 (IFLP) vs. $ [335.14, 500.61] 10 6 (ITFP).
The upper-bound value from IFLP is greater than that from ITFP while the lower-bound one is less, indicating the ITFP strategies are much compromised; especially under conservative condi-tions, the expected system cost based on ITFP would be relatively low. 3.3. Policy analysis
In ITFP, MCO is introduced into the modeling framework, leading to the constraints being relaxed under various relaxation levels. As shown in Fig. 3 , the optimal values of most control 0.5 1.5 2.5 3.5
Millions 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5
Millions ones corresponding to constraints (3l) X (3n) . This means, these three variables are ineffective in controlling system outputs due to not being the minimum value among twelve variables. Thus, the related constraints have minor impact on system outputs. On the contrary, the optimal values of l 7 0 opt to l 7 9 opt same as that in IFLP, indicating constraints (3b) X (3k) behave the most significant impact on the system performance. Thus, the adjustment of parameters in these constraints will intensively affect system outputs.

For example, if the waste generation rate of city 1 in period 1 is decreased from [200, 250] to [175, 250] tonnes/day (Scenario 1), the in Fig. 4 ), leading to another differe nt management strategy. The resulting system cost is $ [307.16, 552.42] 10 6 ,whichprovidesa possibility of curtailing the expected system cost to as low as $ 307.16 10 6 under the most optimistic condition. Nevertheless, process. For instance, when the e xisting landfilling capacity is changed from [6.25, 7.75] 10 5 to [7.00, 8.00] 10 5 t (Scenario 2), the optimal system cost would still equal $ [335.14, 500.61] 10 though a group of different l 7 nopt values are induced ( Fig. 4 ).
Note that l 4 opt and l  X  7 opt are the most apparently changed variables under scenarios 1 and 2, implying the parameters in the lower-bound formula of constraint (3f) and upper-bound formula of constraint (3i) would be the most sensitive factors to system outputs. This suggests that, if the decision maker would like to slightly adjust the current modeling inputs to obtain a much 1 would be the best options. Although changing the other para-meters in constraints (3b) X (3k) can also affect the optimal value of system cost, the efficiency would not be as high as these two. 4. Conclusions
An inexact two-phase fuzzy prog ramming approach is proposed for municipal solid waste management in this study. Multiple control operators are introduced in the hybrid interval mixed-integer programming framework rather than conventional fuzzy flexible programming where one control variable is conducted to both objective function and const raints. A two-phase solving pro-cedure for the resulting optimization model is also provided.
Compared to the previous studies , the proposed approach poses decision maker adjust current system status to benefit the future management; (2) generating comp romised management strategies according to the decision maker X  X  preference, by means of designat-ing multiple control operators to each constraint for reflecting the respective satisfactory levels; ( 3) handling parameter uncertainty existing in most of real-world pr actices expressed as known bounds but unknown distributions; (4) ide ntifying expansion schemes when integer programming methods.

According to the case study, the special parameters having significant or no impact on system performance are specified. Two scenarios conducted through changing such parameters are also examined to verify the impacts of these variations on the system objective. The scenario analysis indicates that the change of ITFP-identified parameters posing significant impacts on the system would intensively affect the optimal system cost, while the adjustment of those posing no impact would not vary the final outputs. This conclusion proves the accuracy of the developed model in identifying key factors. It is also found that the average satisfactory level of optimal solutions from the two-phase model is [0.287, 0.829], which is higher than that obtained from the conventional approach (i.e. [0.130, 0.804]), indicating the advan-tage of the proposed approach in searching for optimal solutions with high satisfactory level.
