 Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a distance measure that compares two time series after optimally aligning them. DTW is being used for decades in thousands of academic and in-dustrial projects despite the very expensive computational complexity, O ( n 2 ). These applications include data mining, image processing, signal processing, robotics and computer graphics among many others. In spite of all this research effort, there are many myths and misunderstanding about DTW in the literature, for example  X  X t is too slow to be useful X  or  X  X he warping window size does not matter much. X 
In this tutorial, we correct these misunderstandings and we summarize the research efforts in optimizing both the ef-ficiency and effectiveness of both the basic DTW algorithm, and of the higher-level algorithms that exploit DTW such as similarity search, clustering and classification. We will discuss variants of DTW such as constrained DTW, multi-dimensional DTW and asynchronous DTW, and optimiza-tion techniques such as lower bounding, early abandoning, run-length encoding, bounded approximation and hardware optimization.

We will discuss a multitude of application areas inclu-ding physiological monitoring, social media mining, activity recognition and animal sound processing. The optimizati-on techniques are generalizable to other domains on various data types and problems.
With the advent of novel sensing techniques, time series data are ubiquitous. Large volumes of time series data are routinely created in scientific, industrial, entertainment, me-dical and biological domains. Examples include physiologi-cal recordings, space telemetry, performance counters, acce-lerometer signals, oceanographic signals, acoustics signals, quantified self, financial indices, etc.

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a distance measure for time series data that is invariant to distortions in time. DTW has being used for decades in many application areas in-
In this tutorial, we focus on two key issues:  X  How to do DTW efficiently  X  How to do DTW effectively
Efficient: We will discuss many optimization techniques
Effective: Many published applications of DTW do not
The tutorial will be illustrated with numerous real world
The tutorial covers selected research published in top con-ferences (e.g. VLDB [6][8][19], SIGKDD [3][13][1][7], ICDE [9][16][21][2], ICDM [12][17][10] and SDM [4][18][22]). We will present a comparative picture of all these methods from different perspectives including efficiency, accuracy, interpre-tability, resource requirement and so on. In addition, there is considerable research work on time series that appears out-side the mainstream data mining conferences; for example, much interesting work on time series is done in PERvasi-ve technologies [5][20], computer vision (CVPR) [14] and speech processing (Tran. Acoustics) [11][15]. We have also made extensive efforts to summarize such work in our com-parative study.
