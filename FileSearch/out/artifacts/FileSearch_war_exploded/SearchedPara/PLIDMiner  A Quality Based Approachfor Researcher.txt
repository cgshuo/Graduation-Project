 A researcher X  X  homepage is a web page maint ained by academic researcher and it in-cludes researcher X  X  identifiable information (such as name, a ffi liation) and research ac-tivities (such as research subjects and publi cations) [1]. Many researchers build their own homepages on the Web mainly for describ ing their researches and contributions, or announcing their new papers [2]. These homepages are valuable and reliable infor-mation sources for academic search. To acces s researcher X  X  homepage, the most Web users query a researcher X  X  name or related information in search engines and select useful homepages from the returned results.

However, more and more homepages with low quality emerged. In a case study, we randomly chose 20 researchers X  in the top 100 researchers 1 in each discipline from Microsoft Academic Search 2 . We applied  X  X uthor name + homepage X  as queries (i.e.  X  X cott Shenker homepage X ) in Google to find homepages. We regard homepages being updated manually after 2011 and contain vari ous aspects of information as high quality homepages, while the other homepages X  qualities are viewed as low. To sum up, there are 27 high quality homepages(4 researchers have more than 1 high quality homepages) and 37 low quality homepages. The case study also shows that 95% researchers have at least one low quality homepage and these pages comprise 57.8% of all homepages retrieved. These low quality homepages provide the Web users with incorrect or incom-plete information. On one hand, more and more dynamically generated researchers X  homepages are emerging because of the dev elopment of numerous academic portals, like DBLife 3 [3] and ArnetMiner 4 [4, 5]. The information in these homepages is less reliable because they are automatically genera ted and unavoidably contain incorrect in-formation. The name ambiguity is a typical example: if di ff erent authors share the same name, academic portals often mix their publica tions together in a single list [6, 7]. Qian et al. pointed out that the name ambiguity problem is unavoidable in dynamically gen-erated homepages [8]. On the other hand, low quality researcher X  X  homepage emerges if a researcher has several di ff erent versions of homepages. Generally, only one or two of them are high quality while the others are not. Fig. 1 is an example of Prof. Scott Shenker, a well-known researcher of comput er science in UC Berkeley, who has a high quality homepage and a low quality homepage. It is obvious that the high quality home-page is more informative and useful than the low quality one.

With the growing emergence of dynamically generated homepages and accumulation of out-of-date homepages, the increasing number of low quality homepage decrease the e ffi ciency of academic search. If low quality homepage is selected by the Web users after querying in search engines, he / she doesn X  X  get the wanted information and has to continue to try other homepages. In particul ar, after we verify several popular academic portals, we find nearly 25% homepage resources in them are not informative. In other words, if a user clicked four homepage resources, one of them is not informative and he / she may have to find other ways to access a more satisfying one. Therefore, discov-ering informative homepages of res earchers can improve academic search e ffi ciency, and it is also an important task for academic search. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work of researchers X  homepages discovery explicitly considering their qualities.

In this paper, we define Informative Researcher X  X  Homepage (IRH) as at least con-sisting of identifiable information (including email, a ffi liation, o ffi ce number, fax, ad-dress) and publication list (a list of citation records, consisting of author names, title, conference or journal name, publishing y ear) because of their importance and univer-sality. Identifiable information (ID) is basic and essential since it is the key information to introduce homepage owner X  X  basic information and to make the owner easily dis-tinguished from other researchers. Publica tion list (PL) is also important because the Web users learn about state-of-the-art theory and technology from them [2, 9]. Mean-while, in the case study we mentioned above, we find that ID and PL are the two most universal elements among all information i n high quality homepages. 100% contain ID and 92.6% contain PL while other information like  X  X xperience X  and  X  X onors X  exist in less than 60% of high quality homepages. It means that the priority order of building homepage is first ID, then PL, and then others. In other words, if a homepage con-tains various information, it is most probable to include both ID and PL. Low quality homepages have the same order. However, only 18.9% of them contain both ID and PL. Therefore, it is optimal to choose ID and PL as requisite components for IRH, which is used as an estimation for high quality homepage.
 In this paper, we propose PLIDMiner to find IRH based on following observations. First, IRHs mainly exist in two ways: ID and PL are in the same web page (Integrated IRH) while ID and PL are in di ff erent web pages (Scattered IRH). Second, in terms of discovering directions, we can either first find ID, then PL, or the other way around.
The contributions of this paper are: (1) The quality factor is getting more and more important because of the growing emergence of low quality homepages. We are first to focus on the quality of researchers X  homepages. We find universal and essential infor-mation in high quality homepages and regar d them as requisite components for IRH. (2) We have proposed an e ff ective model based on machine learning for IRH discovery on the basis of IRH X  X  unique features including URL, page structure and page con-tent. Experiment results on labeled data show that our model performs well with F1 scores over 0.9. (3) We have verified homepage resources in popular academic por-tals to prove the necessity of finding IRH. Plenty of homepage resources (directing to homepages through URL links) in Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search and Ar-netMiner are verified based on PLIDMiner . It turns out that all academic portals have potentials to improve their high of homepage resources. Meanwhile, Google Scholar and ArnetMiner have better homepage res ources than Microsoft Academic Search.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the previous work relevant to researcher X  X  homepage d iscovery. In Section 3, we elaborate PLID-Miner in detail and in Section 4 we show the experiment results of discovery models and overall assessment of three academic por tals. At last, we present our conclusion and future work in Section 5. The most relevant task of homepage disc overy is entry page finding. Entry page is the central page of an organization X  X  web site, which functions as a portal for its infor-mation. It is a fundamental issue in information retrieval research community and has attracted tremendous attention. Xi and Fox [10] used machine learning approaches (like decision tree and logistic regression model) to predict the correct entry page in response to a user X  X  entry page finding query, with considering extensive tagged field and URL. Kraaij et al. [11] enhanced IR systems X  perfo rmance for entry page search by assigning a prior probability to three non-content feat ures of web pages: page length, number of incoming links and URL form. Upstill et al. [12] compared the usefulness of query-independent evidences like document content, anchor text, and URL-type classification and concluded that a general entry page findi ng system should combine these evidences.
There is considerable work focused in resear cher X  X  homepage discovery. An early ef-fort for homepage discovery can be dated back to 1996 resulting in a popular real-world system called Ahoy, in which Shakes et al. [13] used three external systems and applied simple yet successful heuristics to retrieve homepages. Fang et al. [14] proposed a con-ditional undirected graphical model to predict the labels of homepages by capturing the dependence of them. Since publication list is important information in researcher X  X  homepage, Yang et al. [9] used citations as queries to find publication list web pages from search results. Yang and Ho [2] parsed publication lists after noticing that citation records are usually represented as nodes at the same level in the DOM tree and citation records in the same page are presented by similar HTML tags.

Researchers X  homepages are useful resour ces in tackling the problem of name ambi-guity in academic portals. Kang et al. [7] ac quired coauthors information from search engine by querying labeled coauthor pairs. Inspired by the concept of TF-IDF, Tan et al. [15] proposed  X  X nverse Host Frequency (IHF) X , which is based on the observation that pages from rare web sites are stronger source of evidence than pages from common web sites. Pereira et al. [16] used IHF to weigh the documents crawled from the Web and extracted useful evidence for author disambiguation.
 Homepages are also very valuable resour ces in academic social network building. Tang et al. [17] gives a formalization of finding, extracting, and fusing the semantic-based profiling information of a researcher from the Web. Specifically, it finds the  X  X el-evant documents X  from the Web using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Culotta et al. [17] used filters to eliminate noise data retrieved from search engines by using au-thor names as queries. Matsuo et al. [18] and Mori et al. [19] extracted relations of researchers by counting the co-occurrences of researchers X  names from the results re-trieved from search engine and used the information to predict the relation type (like co-authors of a paper, co-members in a project) of researchers.
 3.1 Description As defined in Sect. 1, an IRH at least consists of two key information elements: iden-tifiable information (ID) and publication list (PL). Author names and publication titles are useful hints to query homepages through search engines [1, 20]. For author names queries, search engines return researchers X  homepages containing the authors X  ID and other name related pages, such as the authors X  social network pages. When we query publication titles, search engines fetch researchers X  homepages containing PL and other publication related pages, such as citatio n pages dynamically created by academic por-tals or publications X  download pages. Inspired by these two search patterns observed, we propose PLIDMiner containing two directions X  discoveries for IRH. For ID to PL direction, web pages are processed by following components: ID Classifier, Sub-PL Classifier, ID to PL URL Finder and PL Cla ssifier. Symmetrically, PL Classifier, Sub-ID Classifier, PL to ID URL Finder and ID Classifier comprise the discovering proce-dure in PL to ID direction. Fig. 2 illustrates the procedure of IRH discovery in ID to PL direction. IRH discovery in PL to ID direction is similar to this.

In Fig. 2, the function of each step is: (1) ID Classifier determines whether the input web page contains ID; (2) Sub-PL Classifier is expected to find Integrated IRH among ID pages using subset features of PL Classifier; (3) ID to PL URL Finder explores potential URLs of PL pages in the input ID pages for the discovery of Scattered IRH; (4) PL Classifier determines whether thes e PL candidates actually contain PL. Take the low quality homepage in Fig. 1-(b) as an example, it is first predicted true by ID Classifier because of identifiable information like  X  X itle X  X nd  X  X rganization X , then false by Sub-PL Classifier since there is no PL in t his page. In the third step, potential URLs to PL are found and the corresponding pages are crawled. However, these pages are predicted as non-PL pages by PL Classifier in the last step. So this page is only an ID page, but not IRH. The functions of steps in PL to ID direction are similar. 3.2 PLIDMiner X  X  Components There are six components involved in IRH discovery model. We will introduce them in detail in three groups.
 ID Classifier and PL Classifier. In both ID Classifier and PL Classifier, features are extracted from three aspects: URL features , structural features and page content fea-tures. The detailed description of these three feature subsets are as follows:  X  URL features: URL features play a significant rol e in classifying pages. By analyz-ing homepage URLs, we have found the following features to identify homepages. (1) whether the host name ends with  X .edu X  since the majority of homepages are in universities X  web sites; (2) whether the URL contains the notation  X   X   X  X incemany researchers prefer to use it in their URL s. Specifically, URLs of ID pages tend to contain keywords like  X  X ndex X , while  X  X ub X  or  X  X aper X  for PL pages.  X  Structural features: Homepages often show unique visual characteristics than other web pages. The dominant feature for both classifiers is whether the page has sim-ple intra-page structure because most hom epages are static pages with simple struc-ture. We implement this feature by counting the depth and amount of HTML label while PL has a list, within which each reco rd normally consists of authors X  names, publication title, conference or journal n ame, publishing year and page range.  X  Page content features: Page content is essential to identify homepages. For ID Clas-sifier, keywords like  X  X mail: X ,  X  X  ffi ce: X ,  X  X  ffi liation: X  and their variations are impor-tant hints. For PL Classifier,  X  X ublications X  and  X  X apers X  are expected to exist alone in a single line, rather than appearing in a sentence. These keyword features are ex-tracted with the help of HTML label information like  X  &lt; h &gt;  X  X nd X  &lt; a &gt;  X . Sub-ID Classifier and Sub-PL Classifier. Sub-ID Classifier distinguishes Integrated IRHs from pages containing only ID, while Sub-PL Classifier distinguishes Integrated IRHs from pages containing only PL. Sub-ID Classifier uses unique features of ID which are described above while Sub-PL Classifier uses unique features of PL.
If we want to discover Integrated IRH, why not simply combine ID and PL as one classifier? We ignored this idea because we prefer to distinguish low quality homepages from non-homepages. These two types of pages are significantly di ff erent and this will contribute to the verification of homepag e resources in academic portals. We use Sub-ID Classifier (or Sub-PL Classifier) instead of ID Classifier (or PL Classifier) in step 2 of PLIDMiner because ID and PL Classifiers share common features. It will decrease the performance if we simply use ID and PL Classifiers instead of Sub-ID and Sub-PL Classifiers.
 URL Finders. ID to PL URL Finder finds possible URL links in ID pages, which direct to PL pages. The function of PL to ID URL Finder is similar. URLs from homepages can be generally divided into three types: (1) homepage-relelated URLs; (2) homepage-unrelated URLs; (3) parent and grandparent directory URLs. Homepage-relelated and unrelated URLs are obtained directly from web page content, while parent and grand-parent directory URLs are deduced from original URLs. ID to PL URL Finder finds candidates among homepage relevant and irrelevant URLs, while PL to ID URL Finder uses all these three types of URLs based on the observation that parent or grandparent page of PL always contains ID. We use the URL features in ID Classifier and PL Clas-sifier as heuristic to find candidate URLs. F or the balance of performance and expense on the basis of comparison, the pages of to p 3 candidate URLs are crawled for further process. 4.1 Experimental Setting Data Set. For data preparation, we automatically crawled 750 researchers X  homepages through Microsoft Academic Search. These researchers are among Top 160 in 15 dis-ciplines based on their H index. Among these homepages, we manually labeled 391 ID pages, 328 PL pages, 255 Integrated IRHs and 150 Scattered IRHs. For negative instances, we randomly chose 100 researchers out of 750 to get their names and publi-cation titles information. We used authors X  names and publication titles as queries for Google, and crawled the top 10 search results. Then 444 name related non-homepages and 426 publication title related non-homep ages were labeled. The reason for choos-ing these related pages as negative instances instead of random pages on the Web is that these negative instances are more likely to be regarded as homepages, though this choice may lower PLIDMiner X  X  performance.
 Evaluation Measures. We use standard evaluation measur es in classification: preci-sion p , recall r and the combined measure F 1 of the classifier. The terms true positives TP , true negatives TN , false positives FP , and false negatives FN compare the results of the classifier under test with human judgments (label of pages). The terms  X  X ositive X  and  X  X egative X  refer to the classifier X  X  prediction, and the terms  X  X rue X  and  X  X alse X  refer to the external judgments. The definitions of p , r and F 1 are as following equations: 4.2 Baselines Description IHF Model. IHF is an estimation of web pages X  uniqueness (refered in Sect. 2). We observed that high quality homepages are usually located in more rare domains. There-fore, IHF can be a good predictor to find true IRH from candidates. Besides, di ff erent pages in the same homepage generally shar e the same host name, so the calculation of a homepage X  X  IHF value can ignore its inter-page structure. For comparison, we use IHF as a simple but practical way to find IRH.

To calculate frequency, we need to form a corpus to establish IHF values. First, we crawl 2,000 author names and 2,000 publication titles from Microsoft Academic Search (MAS). These author names are among the top 160 researchers in 15 disciplines ranked by their H index and the publication titles a re randomly acquired from their homepages automatically generated by MAS. Then we use these author names and publication ti-tles as queries in Google. The top 10 returned URLs from Google are truncated to its host name. The calculation of IHF value i s based on this corpus. If a hostname h has frequency f ( h ), then its IHF value is computed as (4).
 Single Page Model. Researcher X  X  homepage is a type of entry page. As described in Sect. 2, there are tremendous work focused in entry page discovery in information retrieval research community. In previous work [10 X 12], various features of one single page are considered. These features are e ff ective to find entry page. We adopt three query-independent features, which are frequently used in finding entry page.  X  Page Length: Statistics in [11] shows that a medium length (60-1000 words) of page is a good predictor for entry page. We eliminate HTML label information (like &lt; a &gt; , &lt; div &gt; ) in web page, which is not presented for the Web users.  X  InLink Number: Entry pages tend to have a higher number of inlinks than other pages (i.e. they are referenced more often). We use a query tip in Google to retrieve the inlinks number of a particular web page. If we use queries like  X  X inks:www.haw-king.org.uk X , Google will return pages refe rring to site  X  X ww.hawking.org.uk X  and their total amount.  X  URL Type: A URL normally consists of the name of the server, a directory path and a filename. Pages at the top level of a specific server are often entry pages. As we descend deeper into the directory tree, the possibility of entry pages decreases. Four types of URLs are considered: 4.3 Performance and Analysis PLIDMiner X  X  Components. The overall performance of PLIDMiner depends on its components X  e ff ectiveness. Ten folds cross-validation is used to assess these compo-nents X  performances on labeled data. Some of these data are reused. For example, some ID pages as positives for ID Classifier are also used as negatives for Sub-ID Classifier. This reusability is reasonable because these classifiers are trained independently. Four machine learning techniques (SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and KNN) are com-pared to obtain optimal model. From the comparison results in Table 1, SVM achieves four highest F1 scores out of six. Besides, for the rest two classifiers, SVM achieves only 0.002 lower than the best ones. Based on the performances of the components and the convenience of automation, we apply SVM in all components in PLIDMiner. Baselines and PLIDMiner. Quality based IRH discovery di ff ers from traditional ones, in which homepage is generally represen ted by one single page. To find an IRH, we should at least discover both ID and PL. ID and PL may locate in the same page, or in di ff erent pages. This requires relatively more complex model, which considers the inter-page structure. To validate the performance of PLIDMiner, we use two baselines (IHF Model and Single Page Model), involving four features with about 22 feature val-ues. We implement experiment for each ba seline and their combined model. We also use the same four machine learning techni ques to assess their performances. Table 2 shows that Single Page Model (SPM) has a much better performance than IHF Model. Their combined model is slightly better than SPM. It is interesting that four techniques get the same F1 score for IHF Model. It is probable that there is only one feature (IHF) used, though we use 9 feature values for discretization. PLIDMiner achieves higher F1 scores than any of these (see Fig. 3), with 0.948 in ID to PL direction and 0.981 for the other direction. It may be confusing that PLIDMiner achieves 0.944 F1 score while its ID Classifier only gets 0.935 (see Table 1) and other components perform even lower. The reason is the components X  performances in Table 1 are trained independently while their performances get considerable impr ovement in PLIDMiner where one compo-nent X  X  output is its next component X  X  input. In other words, their performances become conditional, contributing to much higher precision and slightly lower recall. Discovery in PL to ID direction performs better than discovery in ID to PL direction. The reason is PL Classifier performs better than ID C lassifier (see Table 1) and PL Classifier is the first step of PL to ID direction X  X  discovery while ID Classifier is the first step in the direction of ID to PL. First step in disco very process influences most because of its largest input, so the performance di ff erence appears. 4.4 PLIDMiner X  X  Application With the increasing needs of academic us ers, more and more academic portals have emerged in recent years. Some of these provide comprehensive introduction for users including a ffi liation, publications and homepages links. Most of these links are acquired through users X  annotation or automatic mining. To assess these resources, we apply PLIDMiner in ID to PL direction to verif y these homepage resources in academic por-tals based on the fact that users expect the homepage links to direct to ID pages. Users have to confirm whether the researcher is whom they want or not.

As shown in Fig. 2, the pages processed by PLIDMiner in ID to PL direction can be naturally divided into three categories: (1) Tier 1: IRH; (2) Tier 2: ID pages; (3) Tier 3: non-ID pages. We crawled 529, 1,816 and 2,116 homepage resources from Google Scholar (GS), Microsoft Academic Search (MAS) and ArnetMiner (AM) respectively. The resources in MAS and AM are directly crawled from their sites while the ones in GS are accessed via Jens Palsberg X  X  Homepage 5 . All these homepages belong to top influential scientists in all fields according to their to tal citation times or H index. From Fig. 4, we can find that each academic portal has di ff erent proportion in each tier. To assess overall quality, we quantify score S as (5). P is the percentage of Tier i homepage.  X  i is the weight to evaluate the importance of Tier i homepage. By experience, we set 1, 0.5 and 0 to  X  1 ,  X  2 and  X  3 respectively. As a result, GS and AM achieve about 0.05 higher scores than MAS. Researchers X  homepages are essential res ources in academic search. However, the qual-ity of researchers X  homepages has not been fully discussed before. Based on users X  searching patterns, we proposed IRH discovery model in two directions: ID to PL and PL to ID. Each direction has achieved excellent performance. This provides multi-ways to access IRH with the help of search engines. We applied PLIDMiner to verify re-sources in popular academic portals. Normally, the homepage resource should direct to the ID page, so we used ID to PL direction X  X  discovery as the basis of verification. We crawled plenty of homepage resources from Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search and ArnetMiner. We assess their overall quality of homepage resources and find that Google Scholar and ArnetMiner have better homepage resources than Microsoft Academic Search.

Researchers X  homepages are fundamental and significant information for many ar-eas. As future work, we intend to expand our work in the following three aspects. First, automatic homepage resource re finement with the assist of search engines: this paper provides two ways to discover IRH e ff ectively and give practi cal implementations of homepages resource verification for popular academic portals. These approaches con-tribute to refining the resources. Second, build ing academic social network: Useful in-formation, such as E-mail, a ffi liation and author X  X  full names, is extracted by using regular expression in PLIDMiner. This will contribute to building academic social net-work with comprehensive information and relations of researchers. Third, author dis-ambiguation in academic portals: The publica tion list extracted from discovery model provides reliable and strong evidence for author disambiguation. It is obvious that all the publications in PL of IRH belong to a particular researcher.
