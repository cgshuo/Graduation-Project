 Armor units are designed to defend breakwaters from repeated wave loads. Because armor units are decided by the stability numbers, these numbers are very important to design rubble mound breakwaters. The stability of rubble mound breakwaters is usually analyzed by the well-known empirical formulae by Hudson [1] and van der Meer [2]. Those formulae are used to determine the individual weight of armor blocks of breakwaters. Although those formulae were derived from a number of experimental data, they show too much disagreement between the measured stability numbers and the predicted ones. The uncertainties in the empirical formulae inevitably increase the factor of safety and eventually, the construction cost. Therefore, a number of studies have b een carried out to develop an advanced empirical formula for breakwater stability.

Kaku [3] and Kaku et al. [4] proposed an empirical formula for the damage level prediction based on the van der Meer's expe rimental data. Smith et al. [5] compared their own test results with the prediction by Kaku et al. [4]. Hanzawa et al. [6] proposed an empirical formula for stability number based on their own test data. Although several empirical formulae have been proposed for decades, remarkable improvement has not been seen. Recently, Mase et al. [7] examined the applicability of artificial neural network (ANN) to analyzing the stability of rubble-mound breakwater and compared the predicted stability numbers by neural network with the measured ones of van der Meer and Smith et al. [5]. The ANN technique seems to make a breakthrough in the design of rubble mound breakwaters. Actually, the stability numbers predicted by the ANN agree better than those by van der Meer's ([7]). The stability number, however, still needs to be improved. Kim, D. H. et al. [8] presented several network models to predict the stability number of armor blocks of breakwaters. The same training data set is used for ANN but the structures of the ANN and the number of nodes at input and hidden layer differ from those of Mase's ANN. Even if the ANN technique shows better performance than the empirical model based approach in breakwater design, it can be adapted to new data through a re-training process and needs more efforts to determine the architecture of network and more computational time in training the network. Moreover, the estimated results from the ANN are not probabilistic but deterministic. The probabilistic neural network (PNN), therefore, could be an eff ective and reasonable alternative, because PNN needs less time to determine the architecture of the network and to train the network. Moreover the PNN provides the probabilistic viewpoints as well as deterministic classification results. 
In this paper, the PNN technique is enhanced to reflect the global probability density function (PDF) by summing the heterogeneous local PDF. The heterogeneous local PDF of the PNN is automatically determined to use the individual standard deviation of variables. Training and test patterns for the PNN are prepared using the data sets from the experimental data of van der Meer [9]. The predicted stability numbers are compared with those measured by laboratory. The results show that the PNN can effectively predict the stability numbers in spite of data complexity, incompleteness, and incoherence, and it can be an effective tool for designers of rubble mound breakwaters to support their decision process and to improve design efficiency. PNN is basically a pattern classifier that combines the well-known Bayesian decision strategy with the Parzen non-parametric estimator of the PDFs of different classes [10]. PNN has gained interest because it offers a way of interpreting the network X  X  structure in the form of a probability density function and it is easy to implement. An accepted norm for decision rules or strategies used to classify patterns is that they do so in a way that minimizes the "expected risk." Such strategies are called Bayesian strategies" and can be applied to problems containing any number of classes. Parzen showed how one may construct a family of estimates of ), ( X f [11], and Cacoullos has also extended Parzen's results to estimates in the special case that the multivariate kernel is a product of univariate kernels [12]. In the particular case of the Gaussian kernel, the multivariate estimates can be expressed as where X is the test vector to be classified; ) ( X A f is the value of the PDF of category A at input X ; m is the number of training vectors in category A; p is the and  X  is the smoothing parameter. Note that ) ( X A f is the simple sum of small multivariate Gaussian distributions centered at each training sample because only one global smoothing parameter is used. 
The pattern layer of PNN consists of a number of pattern units. Each pattern unit (shown in more detail in Fig. 1) forms a dot product of the input pattern vector X with a weight vector i W , i i Z W X  X  = , and then performs a nonlinear operation on Z before outputting its activation level to the summation unit. Instead of the sigmoid activation function commonly used for back propagation neural network (BPNN), the nonlinear operation used here is ] ) 1 ( exp[ 2  X   X  i Z . Assuming that both X and i W are normalized to unit length, this is equivalent to using which is the same form as Equation (1) .

To complement the defect of the conventional PNN using one global smoothing parameter, Berthold and Diamond [13] suggested a constructive probabilistic neural network (CPNN) by taking different smoothing parameters for different patterns. Jin et al. [14] applied the CPNN to classify the freeway traffic patterns for incident detection. However, CPNN needed to consider a different probabilistic property for each variable. 
Each variable, such as the permeability of breakwater ( P ), the damage level ( d S ), the surf similarity parameter ( m  X  ), the dimensionless water depth ( s H h / ), and the spectral shape ( SS ), has an individual standard deviation and a different probabilistic property. However, the PDF did not consider the individual probabilistic property of variables in PNN because only one global smoothing parameter was used. Therefore, in this paper, the PNN enhanced to reflect the global probability density function by summing the heterogeneous local PDFs automatically determined to use the individual standard deviation of variables. The basic idea is to individually use the heterogeneous local PDF in a variable becau se the probabilistic property of variables is not homogenous but heterogeneous. The individual PDF was derived from the standard deviation of variables. The PDF for th i sample is determined to sum different standard deviations of the training vector with th j variables (Fig. 2). Therefore, the nonlinear operation of enhanced PNN can be expressed as number of variables; j X is the th j variable of input data; j i W , is the th j variable of the th i training vector; j  X  is the standard deviation with the th j variable. In order to apply the enhanced PNN to the prediction of stability numbers, the rule base which implicitly tells the input (design condition) output (stability number) relationship should first be composed by using the so-called training patterns. About two thirds of the experimental data by van der Meer X  X  ([9]) were used as training patterns, and the others as test patterns to evaluate the performance of the constructed PNN. In the van der Meer X  X  641data, there are only two cases for the number of wave attack; 1000 and 3000 wave attacks. In general, it is not easy to have nonlinear mapping function using only two cases of data in function mapping problems. Therefore, two PNNs were separately constructed; PNN1 is for 1000 attacks and composed of 326 experimental data sets. PNN2 is for 3000 attacks and composed of 315 experimental data sets. The measured stability numbers that were defined as output whose definitions are respectively set to 207 and 196 classes (the ranges of the measured stability numbers was from 0.7907 to 4.3848). In order to make the training pattern an adequate representation of the class distinctions, PNN1 and PNN2 were constructed using 207 and 196 training patterns out of 326 and 315 experimental data sets, respectively, which correspond to 1000 and 3000 wave attacks. Five design parameters including the permeability of breakwater ( P ), the damage level ( d S ), the surf similarity parameter ( m  X  ), the dimensionless water depth ( s H h / ), and the spectral shape ( SS ) were used as the input set for PNN and all the input data are normalized to 0.1~0.9 to give an equal weighting factor before implementing the data to the network. In the network, in cases of impermeability core, permeability core, and homogeneity structure, the permeability of breakwater ( P ) was assumed to be respectively 0.1, 0.5, and 0.6. In cases of Pierson Moskowitz, narrow, and wide spectrum, the spectral shapes ( SS ) were used to be respectively 1, 2, and 3. Table 1 shows the samples for construction of PNN using the van der Meer [9] X  X  data. The global PDF of the PNN was derived from Equation (3). Table 2 shows the standard deviation values and means of the normalized variables. 
To compare the performance of each model in a more reasonable way, the agreement index ( a I ) and the correlation coefficient ( CC ) are used as follows [15] where i e and i m denote the estimated and the measured stability numbers respectively; m is the average of measured stability numbers; T is the transpose matrix. If a I is close to one, the predicted set agrees well to the measured set. 
In case where all the experimental data including trained patterns are used as testing patterns, the results are shown in Table 3. PNN models seem to be the best predictor in this example. 
To evaluate the generalized capability of the ANN and PNN, they were tested only by untrained patterns. The results are shown in Table 4. In which, the results by ANN and PNN models show slight deterioration compared to those in Table 3. However, the comparison results show that PNN can effectively predict the stability numbers.
To optimize the construction of the PNN, a I of models were compared according to the number of training patterns. Figs. 3 and 4 show respectively the trends of a I of PNN1 and PNN2 according to the number of trained patterns. An enhanced PNN method was proposed and incorporated to pr edict the stability number of breakwater. The permeability of breakwater ( P ), damage level ( d S ), surf similarity parameter ( m  X  ), dimensionless water depth ( s H h / ), and the spectral shape ( SS ) are used as inputs to the PNN, and the stability number of breakwater is defined as classes to be predicted by the proposed method. From the results, it has been found that the estimation performance of the proposed method is more effective than those of the empirical model and ANN. We can find the optimum condition of the construction of the PNN through the tren d according to the number of training patterns. Also, the proposed technique has following merits as: (1) It can provide the probabilistic viewpoint as well as deterministic classification results in considering the uncertainties in the design of rubble mound breakwaters. (2) The heterogeneous local PDF of the PNN is automatically determined to use the individual standard deviation of variables. Acknowledgments.
