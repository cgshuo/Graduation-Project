 Opinion holder extraction research is important for discrim-inating between opinions that are viewed from different per-spectives. In this paper, we describe our experience of par-ticipation in the NTCIR-6 Opinion Analysis Pilot Task by focusing on opinion holder extraction results in Japanese and English. Our approach to opinion holder extraction was based on the discrimination between author and authority viewpoints in opinionated sentences, and the evaluation re-sults were fair with respect to the Japanese documents. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Informa-tion Search and Retrieval X  Information Filtering, Selection Process Experimentation Opinion Holder, Opinion Extraction, and NTCIR
Recently, opinion research has been paid much attention by the information retrieval community. Opinion extrac-tion research is divided into three subcategories. The first subcategory is opinion detection, involving opinionated doc-ument detection, opinionated sentence/phrase extraction. The second subcategory is polarity detection, involving pos-itive or negative document classification and positive, neu-tral, or negative sentence/phrase detection. The third sub-category is opinion holder extraction [1]. Opinion holder extraction research is important for discriminating between opinions that are viewed from different perspectives.
The first Opinion Analysis Pilot Task was conducted at the NTCIR-6 workshop in 2006 X 2007 1 . The author played roles as one of organizers and participants. In this paper, we describe our experience of participation by focusing on the opinion holder extraction results in Japanese and English. http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/ntcir-ws6/opinion/index-en.html The opinion extraction subtask was conducted in Japanese, Chinese, and English. For opinion extraction the partici-pants submitted two mandatory results: opinionated sen-tence and opinion holder extraction. Five, three, and six teams (14 teams in total) submitted the 21 runs. The test collection size for Japanese, Chinese, and English are 15,279, 11,907, and 8,379 sentences in 490, 843, and 439 documents for 30, 32, and 28 shared topics each. Opinionated sen-tences and opinion holders in sentences with three holder types were annotated using three annotators in Japanese and English. One sample topic was used for the intercoder session to improve the agreement between the assessors.
The evaluation was based on precision, recall, and F-measure values obtained: the number of correct opinionated sentences and the correct opinion holder. The correctness was defined using two standards. The lenient standard was based on the agreement between two out of three assessors. The strict standard was based on the agreement between three out of three assessors. The population parameters for the precision and recall values were computed from the total number of sentences assessed. We applied a sentence-based evaluation to evaluate the opinion holders. If multiple hold-ers existed in one sentence, and the system detected one of them, then we regarded the system X  X  extraction as valid.
An automatic opinionated sentence classification from au-thor and authority viewpoints was implemented in terms of two types of opinionated sentence estimation using a SVM 2
As training data for author and authority viewpoints, we utilized the annotation information for opinion holder types [2] in Japanese. If opinionated sentences contain a type 3 opinion holder (an agent expressing expressive subjective el-ements), we regard them as having the opinion-from-author viewpoint. If they contain another opinion holder type, 2 SVM light from &lt; http://svmlight.joachims.org/ &gt; . namely type 1 (a person, nation, or organization express-ing private states explicitly) or type 2 (an agent of speak-ing/writing events), we regard them as having the opinion-from-authority viewpoint. For English training data, we uti-lized the MPQA corpus 3 . For author and authority view-points, we discriminated opinionated sentence types using  X  X ested source X  attributes. If the value was  X  X  X  (writer), we regard those sentences as having the opinion-from-author viewpoint. Otherwise, we regard them as having the opinion-from-authority viewpoint.

The effective feature set was as follows. Syntactic dependency was checked using Cabocha in Japanese and Minipar in English.
The opinion holder was extracted using a named entity ex-traction approach. Basically, the author X  X  holder and other authority holder was discriminated using the opininated sen-tence types in 3.1. In the Japanese case, the author X  X  name was discriminated and extracted from the signature. To de-termine authority holder elements, we set four-grade pri-ority rules using three named entity elements as follows: (1) bracketed elements of person, organization, and loca-tion (prioritized in this order and also was in 2, 3, and 4) in the sentence; (2) grammatical subject elements of person, organization, and location in the sentence; (3) grammati-cal subject elements of person, organization, and location in the previous sentences; (4) person, organization, and loca-tion elements other than (1)-(2) in the sentence.
Table 1 and Table 2 list the evaluation results of a Japanese and English opinion analysis based on lenient (L) and strict (S) standards. Our group represented as  X  X UT X . The re-sults of opinion holder extraction were fair for Japanese, but not as good for English.

We checked our author/authority classification results by holder types. In Japanese, although author &amp; authority opinionated sentence estimation was still not matched straight-forwardly from the estimation of holder types, they attained 0.8-0.9 precision based on lenient standards. In English, author opinionated sentence estimated from MPQA corpus http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/databaserelease/ (because of lack of training data in English side of NTCIR-6 opinion corpus) was not matched with holder type 3, but rather holder type 1. This is partly from referring style dif-ference for authors between Japanese and English.
We proposed opinion and holder extraction system from author and authority viewpoints in Japanese and English. We participated in the NTCIR-6 Opinion Analysis Pilot Task and evaluated the effectiveness of our system. The results show that our system performed fairly well with re-spect to Japanese documents, but we found that improve-ments could be made with respect to English documents by conducting post submission analysis.
