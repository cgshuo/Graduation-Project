 Abstract This work aims to improve an N-gram-based statistical machine translation system between the Catalan and Spanish languages, trained with an aligned Spanish X  Catalan parallel corpus consisting of 1.7 million sentences taken from El Peri X dico orthographic, morphological, lexical, semantic and syntactic problems are approached using a set of techniques. The proposed solutions include the development and appli-performance of the improved system is clearly increased, as is shown in both human and automatic evaluations of the system, with a gain of about 1.1 points BLEU observed in the Spanish-to-Catalan direction of translation, and a gain of about 0.5 points in the reverse direction. The final system is freely available online as a linguistic resource. Keywords Statistical machine translation N-gram-based translation Linguistic knowledge Grammatical categories 1 Introduction Currently, Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is one of the most popular Machine Translation paradigms. The SMT approach allows programmers to build a translator in the translation belong to the same language family, the translation quality can be surprisingly high. Furthermore, one of the most attractive reasons to build a statistical system instead of a standard rule-based system is that little human effort is required.
Theoretically, when using SMT, no linguistic knowledge is required. In practice, once the system is built, linguistic knowledge becomes necessary to achieve perfect translations at all grammatical levels, as it has been seen in recent works (Niessen and Ney 2000 ; Popovic  X  and Ney 2004 , 2006 ). In fact, the main question that arose at the beginning of this work was: which are the steps to follow when the main goal is to improve an already high -quality statistical translation?
We consider a translation system to be of high quality when almost no post-editing is needed. Actually, this is a relatively unusual situation in the field of MT, devoted to developing translation at this stage in the Catalan-Spanish pair in both directions. Therefore, the main objective here is to obtain a translation system that does not require any post-editing.

Starting with a high-quality baseline SMT system, a human analysis of the output is performed, which is then used to make further improvements via the introduction of statistical techniques and linguistic rules. One main consideration is the methodology of the study. Our study methodology is based primarily on the detection and When possible, solutions will be statistical; otherwise, they will be linguistic. performed on the system described in the previous section, and the proposed solutions to solve these errors. Then, the improved system is carefully evaluated with respect to the baseline system and, finally, conclusions and future work are summarized in last section. 2 Catalan and Spanish languages Catalan and Spanish belong to the family of Romanic languages, also referred to as Romance or Latin languages. This family also includes other languages, such as French, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian, as it is comprised of all the languages language family. Although the evolution of Latin into such Romanic languages the declension system, which has led to a generalized use of SVO sentence structures with a large amount of prepositions.
 The Catalan language is spoken by more than 9 million people distributed among Catalonia, the Valencian Community, the Balearic Islands, Andorra, and part of Aragon, Sardinia, Southern France and Murcia. On the other hand, Spanish is spoken by more than 400 million people as a native language in Spain and several countries in America, Asia and Africa. Spanish is the second most spoken language in the world after Mandarin Chinese.

The main sociolinguistic characteristic of Catalan is the fact that it is found in a socially bilingual environment in all the regions where it is spoken: with Spanish in Spain (Catalonia, Aragon, Murcia) and Andorra, with French in South France and communication in all of these regions, where helping systems and resources have become increasingly popular and necessary. 3 N-gram-based statistical translation system The translation system used in the current study X  X alled N-II 1  X  X s an N-gram-based SMT system developed at the Universitat Polite ` cnica de Catalunya (UPC), trained with the aligned Spanish X  X atalan parallel corpus taken from El Peri X dico newspaper. This corpus contains 1.7 million sentences, a rich vocabulary and nearly 4.24 10 7 words in average, as shown in Table 1 .

An N-gram-based SMT system regards translation as a stochastic process. We are t highest probability:
The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the assume a general maximum entropy in which a log-linear combination of multiple-feature functions is implemented (Och 2003 ). This approach tends to maximize a linear combination of feature functions: 3.1 Translation feature functions The main feature function is the N-gram-based translation model, which is trained with bilingual n -grams. This model constitutes a language model of a particular bi -approximated by using n -grams of tuples, such as described by the following equation: 1  X  arg max n -gram language model, the bilingual translation model is estimated over a training corpus composed of sentences in the language being modeled. In this case, we consider sentences in the bilanguage mentioned previously.

The N-gram-based approach is monotonic in that its model is based on the schemes.

Tuples are extracted from a word-to-word aligned corpus in such a manner that a unique segmentation of the bilingual corpus is achieved. Although in principle, any Viterbi alignment should allow for tuple extraction, the resulting tuple vocabulary strongly depends on the particular alignment set considered. According to our achieved when the union of the source-to-target and target-to-source alignment sets is used for tuple extraction.

In this way, which is different from other implementations, where one-to-one (Bangalore and Riccardi 2000 ) or one-to-many (Casacuberta and Vidal 2004 ) alignments are used, tuples are extracted from many-to-many alignments. This implementation produces a monotonic segmentation of bilingual sentence pairs, which allows for the simultaneous capture of contextual information and the segmentation also allows the estimation of the n -gram probabilities. To guarantee a unique segmentation of the corpus, tuple extraction is performed according to the following constraints:  X  a monotonic segmentation of each bilingual sentence pair is produced,  X  no word inside the tuple is aligned to words outside the tuple, and  X  no smaller tuples can be extracted without violating the previous constraints.
Illustration 1 presents a simple example showing the unique tuple segmentation for a given pair of sentences, which mean he left at half -past one .

Two important observations from Illustration 1 , related to null and embedded words, must be considered:
NULL : In some cases, such as tuple 2, there are possible occurrences of tuples appropriate translations for such unaligned elements. The problem of how to handle since no NULL is actually expected to occur in translation inputs, this type of tuple is not allowed. Any target word that is linked to NULL is attached either to the word that precedes or to the word that follows it. To determine this, we use the IBM-1 probabilities. More specifically, the IBM-1 lexical parameters (Brown et al. 1993 ) are used for computing the translation probabilities of two possible new tuples: the one that results when the null-aligned-word is attached to the previous word, and the direction is selected according to the tuple with the highest translation probability.
Embedded words : Often, a large number of single-word translation probabilities are left out of the model. This happens for words that are always embedded in tuples containing two or more words. Consider for example the word quarts in Illustration 1 . This word is embedded into tuple 6 . If a similar situation is encountered for all occurrences of quarts in the training corpus, then no translation probability for an independent occurrence of this word will exist. To overcome this problem, the tuple n -gram model is enhanced by incorporating 1 -gram translation probabilities for all the embedded words detected during the tuple extraction step. These 1 -gram translation probabilities are computed from the intersection of both the source-to-target and the target-to-source alignments.
 3.2 Additional feature functions Apart from the translation model, state-of-the-art systems include several compo-nent models are introduced in the maximum entropy approach: typically the target language model and the word bonus. For the Catalan X  X panish language pair, translation quality (de Gispert and Marin  X  o 2006 ). However, the POS target language model, which introduces linguistic knowledge (Crego et al. 2006 ), may help. This POS target language model has to be combined together with the word bonus model for each produced target word, which compensates for the POS target language model preference for short sentences. 4 Error analysis of the baseline N-II system The linguistic error analysis of the baseline N-II system was performed by Royal Spanish Academy, 3 several press articles from the digitalized version of the following newspapers: El Peri X dico 4 (in both Spanish and Catalan), La Vanguardia 5 (Spanish), Avui 6 and El Punt 7 (Catalan). Since it is well-known that the same sentence can be translated in many different ways, the following criterion was applied in order to decide whether a sentence was correct or not: all the translations achieved can be considered as correct if they maintain the meaning of the original sentence and are grammatically correct.

The main errors found in the translation system were classified according to their corresponding linguistic level: orthographic, morphological, lexical, semantic, and syntactic. Below, the specific problems are described and exemplified in detail and summarized in Table 2 , which specifies the direction of translation where the errors are found: Catalan to Spanish (ca2es), Spanish to Catalan (es2ca) or both. 4.1 Orthographic errors 4.1.1 Geminated l (l l) The geminated l is one of the characteristics of Catalan that differentiates it from the other Romanic languages. The correct way of writing this grapheme involves use of widespread among users. The system translates correctly the words containing a Otherwise, the tokenization process is not performed properly, and erroneous translations are generated. An example related to this kind of error from Catalan into translation.
 4.1.2 Apostrophe The apostrophe is used in Catalan to elide a sound. The singular articles ( el, la ), the preposition de and some pronouns are apostrophized in front of words beginning with a vowel or an h plus a vowel, though there are some exceptions. In some cases, apostrophized: And some words are apostrophized when they should not be: 4.1.3 Coordinating conjunctions y and o The Spanish coordinating conjunctions y and o change to e and u when they precede words starting by i or o( or hi or ho) , respectively. The baseline N-II system usually fails to perform such conversions, leading to an incorrect use of the conjunctions: 4.2 Morphological errors 4.2.1 Lack of gender concordance Some words are given a different gender in Catalan and Spanish languages. For instance, the word signal is feminine in Spanish ( la se X al ) and masculine in Catalan ( el senyal ). Therefore, it is common to find a lack of gender concordance in articles and adjectives with a noun that changes its gender from one language to the other:
This lack of concordance affects also the Spanish X  X atalan translation of some invariant possessives such as mi , mis (my), tu, tus (your), etc. 4.3 Lexical errors 4.3.1 Capital letters and numbers Other cases related to unknown words can be found at the lexical level; for instance, in numbers and words that appear only in capital letters in the training corpus. In this case, they will be recognized with capital letters: 4.3.2 Time In general, time expressions in Spanish and Catalan differ considerably. The main difference is found in the use of the quarters: while in Spanish the time is expressed through the quarters that pass a specific hour, Catalan talks about the quarters that are approaching a specific hour. E.g.:
These differences in the time expression lead to erroneous translations in the baseline N-II system: 4.4 Semantic errors 4.4.1 The perque ` final/causal conjunction The conjunction perqu X  in Catalan is a polysemy-related case. When used to introduce a causal clause, it must be translated into porque (because). However, when it introduces a final subordinate clause, the meaning changes, and it should be translated into para que (in order to). Nevertheless, the baseline N-II system usually translates this conjunction into porque , irrespective of its meaning: 4.4.2 Solo adverb/adjective In Spanish, solo can be both an adjective and an adverb. Irrespective of its grammatical function, it must be used without a written accent, unless a possible semantic confusion exists. In this case, the adverb must be accented. However, the even when it is not necessary. Therefore, the non-accented solo is usually translated as if it was an adjective: 4.4.3 The verb soler Another homonymy-related case is found in the verb soler (to be used to). Usually, N-II translates the Catalan verb sols or sol (corresponding to the 2nd and 3rd singular persons of present tense in indicative mood, respectively, of the verb soler ), into the Spanish adjectives solos and solo (alone), instead of the corresponding verb conjugations sueles and suele: 4.4.4 Possessive pronouns and adjectives A systematic error was observed in translations between possessive pronouns from Catalan to Spanish: the possessive pronouns meu (mine), teu (yours), seu (his/hers), etc. are translated as the possessive pronouns mi (my), tu (your), su (his/her), respectively, instead of m X o , tuyo , suyo , etc., as it should be: 4.5 Syntactic errors 4.5.1 Pronominal clitics Usually, the pronominal clitics lead to translation errors in both Catalan-to-Spanish and Spanish-to-Catalan directions. The most frequent errors are due to an erroneous combination with the corresponding verb: or the elision of the pronoun in the target language: 4.5.2 The relative pronoun cuyo The translation of Spanish relative pronoun cuyo (whose) involves a reordering of elements when it is to be translated into Catalan: If this reordering is not considered, the N-II will lead to erroneous translations: 4.5.3 Obligation correct, is usually obtained in the Spanish-Catalan translation: 4.5.4 Elision/insertion of the preposition de It has been seen previously that the verbal periphrasis tener que was translated as tenir que instead of haver de . However, when translating the Spanish form deber , which has the same meaning, the correct expression, haver de, is obtained, but the preposition de is usually missing:
Moreover, the preposition de is also elided when translating desde (from, since) into Catalan, obtaining des instead of des de : On the other hand, the preposition de falls in front of the conjunction que in Catalan, and this is normally not taken into account by the translator: 5 Proposed solutions To resolve the errors described in the previous section, several techniques need to be applied according to the idiosyncrasy of the problem. These can be classified into orthographic errors X  X s well as the use of rules based on grammatical categories, description of such techniques and the errors they can solve. 5.1 Text edition translation. The geminated l, for instance, was corrected before translation by normalizing the writing of the middle dot. Other cases, such as the obligation tener que and the conjunctions y and o , have been corrected through post-processing after the translation. Some examples of correction by text edition can be found in Table 3 . 5.2 Grammatical category-based approach Grammatical categories have been successfully used in statistical translation in order to deal with several problems like reordering (Crego and Marin  X  o 2007 ) and automatic tag, corresponding to the word to translate, so that the statistical model is capable of distinguishing the word depending on its category and to learn from context. In the current improved system, the grammatical category was provided by the some of the problems found in the baseline system. The grammatical category can decoder -based solution . While the former includes solutions for apostrophes, clitics, capital letters at the beginnings of sentences, the relative pronoun cuyo and polysemy disambiguation, the latter becomes useful for the homonymy disambig-uation and the lack of gender concordance. A detailed description of the problems solved by this grammatical category-based approach is presented below.
 5.2.1 Apostrophe Use of the apostrophe in Catalan relies mostly on basic rules in which the article el , la and the preposition de are elided when preceding words that begin with a vowel or a silent h :
Nevertheless, there are a considerable number of exceptions related to these rules, for instance: 5.2.2 Pronominal clitics from the corresponding verb. Then, the isolated pronominal clitic is translated and, translation. These correction rules consider the following factors: 1. The Spanish accentuation rules, since the position of the stressed syllable 2. The combination of the Catalan pronouns, which, unlike Spanish pronouns, use
Some examples of clitics and apostrophe correction can be found in Table 4 . 5.2.3 Capital letters at the beginning of the sentence To solve one of the causes of unknown words, a technique that uses morphological information is used: all the words that can be found at the sentence beginning are letters in the training corpus will no longer seem to be unknown words when lower case letters are used during translation. Table 5 shows an example in which, given a source sentence (S), we see the corresponding translations before (T1) and after (T2) applying the capital letters processing. 5.2.4 Cuyo pronoun Problems related to the relative pronoun cuyo mainly arise because few sentences including this pronoun are contained in the training corpus, and so the system is not able to learn the specific structure properly. To solve this problem , a preprocessing rule was applied to transform the Spanish structure into a literal translation of the Catalan structure del qual ; in other words, the sentences containing cuyo or some of its other forms ( cuya, cuyos, cuyas ) were transformed into sentences containing del alignment was easier. Some translation errors related to this pronoun were avoided in this way (see Table 5 ).
 A similar process was then performed in the inverse direction X  X atalan-to-Spanish X  X s a post-processing procedure: when the Catalan grammatical structure that corresponds to the Spanish structure that makes uses of cuyo is found, del qual is translated into cuyo , and the proper word reordering is performed. Otherwise, it is literally translated into del cual . 5.2.5 Polysemy disambiguation As noted in the previous section, the conjunction perqu X  is translated into para que when followed by a final subordinate clause, which is expressed by a verb in the subjunctive mood. Thus, when a verb in the subjunctive is detected after the conjunction perqu X   X  X ven if there are other words in between X  X he translation into Spanish will be para que . In the same way, another rule will fix errors that occur if the verb is expressed in the indicative mood, so that the translation will be porque. Table 6 shows an example of correcting the use of this conjunction.

This rule is not 100% fulfilled, since it is possible to find a verb in the indicative which is preceded by the conjunction porque . However, an estimation made from the training corpus showed that this structure is found in less than the 0.5% of the cases in which the conjunction porque appears. 5.2.6 Homonymy disambiguation In the translation task, it is quite common to find two words spelled the same in the homonymous and they are characterized by a different grammatical category, such a category will be useful to disambiguate their meaning. The verb soler , the adjective/ adverb solo and the possessives are examples of homonymous words that lead to problematic ambiguity. In some cases, the tag given by Freeling is simply added to the homonymous words to disambiguate them. In other cases, the output tag given by Freeling is not correct X  X s in the case of the adjective/adverb solo and the possessives X  X o it becomes necessary to establish a set of rules that will provide the correct tag. This set of rules is described below. 5.2.6.1 The verb soler In order to disambiguate the homonymous words sol and sols , the corresponding adjective or verb tag given by the Freeling was added to the words in question. 5.2.6.2 The solo case In order to solve the solo problem, the following rules were implemented in order to identify, in doubtful cases, whether the solo term was an adverb or an adjective, since the Freeling tool would output erroneous tags.
These rules were then applied to the source language and the corresponding tag was added to the word. Thus, a source sentence like Ven X a solo (he was coming both possibilities and to learn from context. 5.2.6.3 Possessives A similar task was performed on Catalan possessive adjec-specific word as an adjective or pronoun. These tags are then added to the Catalan corpus.

Table 6 shows some examples of correction by using homonymy disambiguation source sentence (S), the resulting translations before (T1) and after (T2) applying the obtained tags are shown. The errors produced in T1 are solved in T2. 5.2.7 Gender concordance The problem of gender concordance is solved by using a POS language model in the target language. This allows us to assign higher value to those word sequences that maintain gender coherence; therefore, the likelihood of a sequence like pilota _FN vermella _FAdj (where FN is a feminine noun and FAdj a feminine adjective) will be higher than pilota _FN vermell _MAdj (where MAdj is a masculine adjective), since the POS language model will have seen the sequence FN-FAdj more times than the sequence FN-MAdj (see an example of correction in Table 7 ). Neverthe-less, the POS language model will be useful only if the bilingual unit exists. Thus, the translation of senyal _MN blanc _MAdj will remain as se X al _FN blanco _MAdj instead of se X al _FN blanca _FAdj, since the tuple blanc#blanca is not contained in the translation model.

Remember that the POS language model requires the introduction of the word bonus feature to compensate for short outputs. To optimize the POS language model and the word bonus with the minimum error rate procedure (Och 2003 ), a specific development corpus was created. This development corpus, which consists of 476 grammatically correct and that it contained all the problems we had encountered.
Given that we have tuned these features on a special corpus, we consider them as part of the improved system. Therefore, notice that the baseline system as in previous Catalan-Spanish works (de Gispert and Marin  X  o 2006 ) does only include the translation model. 5.3 Numbers and time categorization 5.3.1 Numbers As shown in the previous section, some numbers that were not in the training corpus might appear in the source sentence to be translated, so such numbers are marked as unknown and thus not translated. To avoid this problem, a set of rules was implemented to detect the numbers in the source language X  X xcept for un/una (one), dos/dues (two), nou (nine) and deu (ten), which can also correspond to other terms than numbers X  X nd then to codify and generate them in the target language.
In order to detect the numbers, it is necessary to consider their formal structure X  i.e. whether the number is a compound noun, using or not using dashes, etc. It is also necessary to take into account that numeral adjectives can have an associated gender. A specific codification is thus defined so that, in the generation process, the final number is coherent with the detected number. For instance, the numeral adjective quaranta -una would have the corresponding codification:
The first and last fields (Z) indicate a numerical expression. The second, third and fourth fields indicate: the numerical expression in figures, a feminine adjective, and the number of words replaced in the codification, respectively. The feminine mark is used to establish gender coherence with the following term. 5.3.2 Time translation errors were frequent. In order to solve this problem, the same procedure performed with the numbers is performed here: the time expressions are detected, codified, and generated again in the target language.

Time expressions are identified using three different structures, following the most formal notations presented by J. M. Mestres (2004) 8 : the precise international notation, the formal general notation, and the mixed formal notation. In the Catalan codification. However, the code was thought for all the notations in order to be able to be used in other language pairs.

The codification is performed by using a ten-field code, where the first and the last fields express the fact that we are dealing with a time expression (HORA). Thus, the time phrase it X  X  4.45 pm , expressed in Catalan as S X n tres quarts de cinc de la tarda , would be codified as follows: where the inside fields express the following:
Table 8 shows an example in which, given a source sentence (S) with an unknown numerical expression leading to a non-correct translation (T1), the Examples for time expressions are also included.

Table 9 summarizes the errors encountered in this study and classified according to the type of solution proposed for overcoming them. 6 Evaluation The SMT scientific community tends to agree on using the BLEU automatic measure to evaluate improvement in a translation system. Additionally, human evaluation is used when enough resources are available.

In this study, we introduced linguistic knowledge into an SMT system, mainly by human evaluations were used in the final system in order to make the final evaluation complete and objective. The baseline system X  X n N-gram-based SMT system without linguistic information and only including the translation model as in previous Catalan-Spanish works (de Gispert and Marin  X  o 2006 ) X  X as thus compared with the same system after adding the improvements described in this paper. 6.1 Test corpora The Spanish source test corpus consists of 711 sentences extracted from El Pa X s and La Vanguardia , while the Catalan source test corpus consists of 813 sentences extracted from the Avui newspaper and from transcriptions from the TV program  X gora . Each direction set contains two manual references. Table 10 shows the statistics on the number of sentences, words and vocabulary for each language. 6.2 Human evaluation provided. First, the test sentences are classified into different categories according to the errors that were outlined in the error analysis section. This classification allowed corresponding problem. Second, a generic comparison was performed in order to evaluate how much better the improved system was, in general terms, with respect to the baseline system.
 6.2.1 Specific evaluation Although the proposed solutions were applied to improve detected errors, a specific specific problem and a specific technique to solve it, the aim here is to know how many cases were (a) Already correct : baseline outputs that were not modified by the improved (b) Not corrected : baseline outputs that were incorrect and that the improved (c) Improved : baseline outputs that were incorrect and that the improved system (d) Damaged : baseline outputs that were correct and that the improved system
This classification can be seen in Table 11 for both directions of translation, together with the overall percentage of already correct , not corrected , improved and present a problem, a considerable number of cases (18.9% in ca2es and 13.9% in es2ca ) were initially problematic and solved using the presented techniques.
Thus, the analysis shows that the proposed techniques are useful for handling the detected problems. Regarding clitics, some cases were still not solved, mainly because the decoder chose the wrong pronoun or a different place: l X  X  X tim any * ho interchangeable, but the wrong pronoun selection results from a case of polysemy, since both pronouns are related to the same source (Spanish) pronoun. The clitics grammatically correct sequence; if the translation is not correct, the solution is not able to solve the problem.

Since the human evaluation was performed from the journalism corpus, not all the error types were present in the evaluated sentences. This is the reason why not all the analyzed error types are contained in Table 11 .

The damaged cases appear for several reasons. Clitics such as estar -se , for instance, were damaged because in some contexts, estar is not recognized as a verb by the tagger. Therefore, the proposed solution damages the baseline system, which was able to learn the correct translation from the training corpus.

In two other situations, translations in the number category were not able to maintain gender concordance, so when a sequence had been seen in the training corpus, the translation of numbers was better performed by the baseline than by the improved system. Finally, the solution applied to handle the apostrophe problem did not cover all the exceptions, such as the apostrophe of some Catalan acronyms that do not follow the basic apostrophe rules. This led to damaged cases, for which an additional dictionary would be required to build a proper apostrophe rule.
Figure 1 shows the percentage of correct cases over the total number of problematic cases treated above. The percentage of correct cases increases clearly in both directions of translation: in Catalan to Spanish (es2es) correct cases go from increases from 84.2 to 94.6%. 6.2.2 General evaluation Second, a generic comparison of both systems was performed using human criteria. Ten native evaluators made a blind comparison of 200 different sentences randomly selected from each system. Five evaluators are native in Catalan and Spanish and they evaluated Spanish-to-Catalan. Five different evaluators are native in Spanish and they evaluated Catalan-to-Spanish. Score criterion was simple: given the source sentence, they were asked to choose the best translation from the two outputs. Tails were accepted. The results obtained in this evaluation are shown in Table 12 , ordered by evaluator and system, and the overall resulting percentages of the results are illustrated in Fig. 2 . 6.3 Automatic evaluation The test corpus and two available references were used to compute the BLEU score for the translations provided by the baseline and the improved systems. The results are presented in Table 13 . It can clearly be seen that the improved system performs significantly better in terms of BLEU. In the Catalan-to-Spanish direction the gain is 0.47 points BLEU, whereas in the Spanish-to-Catalan translation the improvement rises to 1.09 points BLEU. The margin of error was calculated with a 90% Wald confidence interval (Newcombe 1998 ).

The results show a higher improvement in the Spanish-to-Catalan direction than Catalan-to-Spanish translation, we are starting from a better baseline system, which is more difficult to outperform. The second reason may be that, as was seen before, work. To evaluate the improvement of the system when using the specific problems addressed, an ad hoc test was proposed, consisting of 636 sentences for both directions of translation. Each direction set had one manual reference. The number of sentences, words and vocabulary for each language are found in Table 14 .This test was built to evaluate exclusively the proposed methods. Therefore, a Catalan-Spanish linguist wrote this test set from scratch focusing on the points that we were trying to solve.

Subsequently, a second automatic evaluation was performed with this test, which tried to represent the challenges the present study was trying to overcome, so that it improvement is about 5.5 points BLEU in both directions of translation. 7 Conclusions and future work problems found in a preliminary statistical machine translation between the Catalan-linguistic dimensions: orthographic, morphological, lexical, semantic and syntactic. categorization. These techniques resulted in an improvement of the baseline translation system, especially in the Spanish-to-Catalan direction, where a gain of up to 1.1 points BLEU was obtained. Human evaluation also showed the employed considering both the specific problems addressed in this work and the overall performance of the system.

Nevertheless, the list of problems to overcome is still not finished, and they have morphological level, and the use of specific prepositions at the syntactic level. The other conjugated forms of the verb in question are included in the training corpus, so Spanish first person simple future of the verb to pass is translated, while the second person is output as an unknown word:
Other common errors are related to the different use of prepositions in both languages. In Catalan, for instance, the preposition a is normally not used in front of a direct object, so this preposition will not appear in the target (Spanish) language when it is, in fact, required: On the other hand, the a and en prepositions are commonly used in Catalan and Spanish languages to introduce both special and temporal elements. However, they frequently observed in such cases due to these usage differences.

Future work should include the detection of additional errors. Polysemy and homonymy, for instance, have been detected in the current work by means of human knowledge. A new challenge would be to generalize homonymous and polysemic solving remaining errors, future work should also work to avoid damaged cases: those cases already correct and included in the training corpus should remain unchanged in the translation process.

However, the current work has demonstrated that, despite the list of errors that are still to be solved, the presented N-II system provides high-quality translations between Catalan and Spanish languages and is freely available online as a linguistic resource. References
