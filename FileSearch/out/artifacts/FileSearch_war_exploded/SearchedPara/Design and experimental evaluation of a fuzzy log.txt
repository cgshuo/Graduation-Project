The rules associated with small pressure errors result in the pressure signal is rapidly approaching the pressure pressure signal is slower.

When the servo valve pressure is at a level around its region, the controller works in the direction of increase approaching (deviating) from the reference. 4. Simulation study
The simulation study used the model parameters obtained A320 and A310.

The sampling time fixed to the pressure controller was 0.74 ms. This time was measured as corresponding to the pressure values: 80, 120, 15 and 200 bars. Based on these 4.1. System operating specifications
