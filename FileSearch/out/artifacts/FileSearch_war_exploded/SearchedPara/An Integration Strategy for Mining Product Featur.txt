 With the development of Web 2.0, the web has become an extremely valuable source for mini ng opinions. In this paper, we study how to automatically mine product features and opinions by integrating multiple review sour ces. We propose an integration strategy to solve the problem. E xperiments show that the proposed strategy is effective. H.3.3 [Information Search and Re trieval]-Information filtering.

Opinion integration, information extraction, clustering The Web has become an extremely priceless source for mining opinions, for instance, customer re views. Unfortunately, it is hard for a potential customer and manufacturers to access the opinion information. One way to solve the problem is to mine product features and opinions automatically. M. Hu et al. [1] used association rule to extract product features and Popescu et al. [2] adopted PMI method to mine opini ons. Generally speaking, there are two main kinds of reviews, namely semi-structured reviews and unstructured ones. In this pa per, we will study how to mine product features and opinions by integrating semi-structured and unstructured review sources. The ma in idea is to treat the mining results of semi-structured revi ews as prior knowledge. Using the prior knowledge we mine produc t features and opinions from unstructured reviews more effectiv ely. In addition, we integrate more abundant opinion informati on with the mining result of semi-structured reviews to obtain more informative information. We define a semi-structured review as {, ,... } 12 sR sg sg sg m = where (1 ) s gim i  X  X  X  is a segment. Similarly, we define an sentence. A product has a set of co mponents and also has a set of attributes. We use  X  X eatures X  to represent both components and attributes. Explicit feature is a feature f that appears in the segment of review s R or uR . Implicit feature is a feature f that In this section, we will make use of the results of section 3.1 to mine product features and opini ons from unstructured reviews. Through observation, we find th at different customers may comment on different product features, but the words they use will converge. So we can make use of the similarity to extract product features in unstructured reviews a nd then cluster them with their counterparts in semi-structured re views based on some similarity measures. The other reason that we adopt clustering is that the product features are inherent with redundancy, which can be reduced through clustering. To extr act and cluster the features and opinions in unstructured reviews, we use linguistic similarities to measure the similarity among product features. 3.2.1 Semantic Similarity We use WordNet to compute the semantic similarity between two words. We adopt Jiang and Conrath's measure [3] to measure semantic similarity. We compute the similarity as follows: 3.2.2 Phrase Similarity We use Avigdor Gal's method [4] to calculate phrase similarity. The similarity of two phrases p i and p j is defined as the ratio between the number of common words in p i and p j and the total number of unique words in phrases p i and p j . In order to generate feature-opinion tuples, we need associate the opinion words with the features. Inspired by Turney X  X  work in [5], we use PMI-IR to generate the feature-opinion tuples. PMI-IR is defined as follows: Where w i and w j are words. (, ) Pw w ij is the joint probability of i and w j . () Pw i and () Pw j is the probability of w i and w j independently. The quality of the PMI algorithm largely depends on the size of training data. We use a more relevant corpus which is composed with semi-struc tured reviews and unstructured reviews. The reason why we choose our reviews data as a training corpus is that our reviews data is more consistent with less noise. Precision (p), recall (r) and F-score (F) are used as measures to evaluate the effects of our proposed method. Table 1 compares the results of Hu X  X  and Popesc u X  X  method based on the same benchmark data set [1]. From Tabl e 1, it can be observed that our method has better recall and F-scor e than Popescu X  X  Method. The improvement is due to the integra tion of semi-structured reviews.
