 How does the web search behavior of  X  X ich X  and  X  X oor X  peo-ple differ? Do men and women tend to click on different results for the same query? What are some queries almost exclusively issued by African Americans? These are some of the questions we address in this study.

Our research combines three data sources: the query log of a major US-based web search engine, profile information provided by 28 million of its users (birth year, gender and ZIP code), and US-census information including detailed de-mographic information aggregated at the level of ZIP code. Through this combination we can annotate each query with, e.g. the average per-capita income in the ZIP code it origi-nated from. Though conceptually simple, this combination immediately creates a powerful user modeling tool.
 The main contributions of this work are the following. First, we provide a demographic description of a large sam-ple of search engine users in the US and show that it agrees well with the distribution of the US population. Second, we describe how different segments of the population differ in their search behavior, e.g. with respect to the queries they formulate or the URLs they click. Third, we explore appli-cations of our methodology to improve web search relevance and to provide better query suggestions.

These results enable a wide range of applications includ-ing improving web search and advertising where, for in-stance, targeted advertisements for  X  X amily vacations X  could be adapted to the (expected) income.

What kind of web results would you personally want to see for the query  X  wagner  X ? Well, if you are a typical female US web user you probably have pages about the composer Richard Wagner in mind. 1 However, if you are a male US web user you are more likely to be referring to a company called Wagner which produces paint sprayers. 2 Similarly, the term most likely to complete the beginning  X  hal  X  is in general  X  lindsey  X  3 , whereas for people living in areas with an above average education level the most likely completion is  X  higdon  X  4 These two examples illustrate that demographic factors have a measurable influence on search behavior.
Even though this user modeling can be an interesting end by itself, the ultimate goal for the search engine is to provide a better service to users. This can take the form of more relevant search results, more helpful query suggestions, more interesting news items on a portal page or, last not least, improved targeting of advertising. Of course, the potential for improvements in these areas is not new and there exists a rich set of literature on the use of personalization [6, 26].
Our approach of grouping users by demographic features, such as age or income, is different from personalization where models are learned for individual users. Given enough data about individual users, personalization can indeed be very powerful. However, our approach is more applicable in prac-tice because (i) it requires less training data, as we use a small number of different user classes, (ii) it has less poten-tial for breaching the user X  X  privacy, as we do not aggregate information on a per-user level, and (iii) it has a simpler in-terpretation, as we use real-life features with clear semantics instead of latent variables.

As far as sponsored search is concerned, especially this last issue is of relevance as advertisers could, e.g., choose to have their ads displayed only for users in a particular ex-pected income range. This would go well beyond the current  X  X emographic site selection X , which uses only age and gender
For women the most clicked URL was http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner .
For men the most clicked URL was http://www.wagnerspraytech.com/ .

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section outlines previous work related to ours. Section 3 describes how we obtained and processed the data. Section 4 discusses our methodology. Basic characteristics of the demographics of web searches are shown in Section 5. The impact of using demographic information on three different application scenarios, (i) web search, (ii) automatic labeling of URLs, and (iii) query suggestions, is quantified in Section 6. As we see our work as a first, exploratory study, we discuss possible extensions in Section 7. The final section presents concluding remarks. Inferring demographics from behavior. It is well es-tablished that the writing style of texts can be used to infer characteristics of their authors, such as gender or age [1, 2]. Koppel et al. [23] apply this method to blog pages.
Search logs kept by search engines have been used to in-fer demographic characteristics of their users. Hu et al. [12] represent users by the words in the pages they click on, and by the output of a topic classifier on those pages. They are able to determine gender with 80% accuracy and age (dis-cretized in 5 ad-hoc age groups) with 50% accuracy. Jones et al. [15] represent users by the queries written by them. They achieve 84% accuracy on gender and 79% accuracy on age (within  X  10 years of error). In the current paper we use an approach that is related to both: we represent users by the queries they write and by the identity (but not the contents) of the documents they click upon.
 Gender and internet usage. Jackson et al. [13] inter-viewed 600 undergraduate students and found that in gen-eral females used e-mail more and web less than males ( X  Wom-en communicating and men searching  X  is the sub-title of their article). Gavin et al. [14] interviewed over 600 students and found that males used the internet in general more than females, but found no evidence of a different pattern of com-munication vs search among genders. Specifically in the case of web search, Lorigo et al. [17] use eye-tracking to uncover differences in search strategies across different types of tasks and among genders. http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer. py?hlrm=en&amp;answer=33743 Income, race, and the digital divide. When demo-graphic dimensions such as income or age are related with in-ternet usage, an unequal access is observed, which is known as the Digital Divide [22]. The digital divide, for instance, establishes a gap between countries with a high gross domes-tic product and countries with a low gross domestic product in terms of broadband access. The digital divide also can be observed within a country by itself. For instance, in the US it has been observed that more income and more edu-cation are correlated with a higher probability of having a computer at home, but that African Americans 6 are much less likely to have a computer at home across all levels of income and education [10].
 The need for demographic-aware search. Morgan and Trauth [20] advocate for taking into account individual dif-ferences in web search. Ford, Miller and Moss [7, 9, 8] have studied this topic extensively, emphasizing the differences among the strategies people with different cognitive styles use to understand information and acquire knowledge. For a survey of works on search behavior, see [11].
 Groupization to improve search. Teevan et al. [27, 21] investigated the benefit of using  X  X roupization X  rather than personalization to improve web search ranking. In their studies, done in a work environment with a total of roughly 200 participants, they showed that pooling search history in-formation from members in the same  X  X roup X , ranging from job function to gender, can lead to gains in normalized Dis-counted Cumulative Gain (DCG), in particular for group-related queries. Apart from the setting (work environment with access to desktop information vs. anonymized use of query logs), and the scale ( &lt; 1,000 users vs. &gt; 1,000,000 users), one of the main differences to our work is that we are also interested in descriptive results (see Section 5), as well as applications apart from web search (see Section 6). Conditional entropy of search logs. The question of how much could we improve web search by knowing the identity, or rather the IP address, of a web user, was studied in [19]. Specifically, they measure the conditional entropy H ( U RL | Q, IP ) and compare it to H ( U RL | Q ). Though these are interesting and intuitive measures to look at, there are certain kinds of methodological problems in practice. For example, even when tuples ( U RL, Q, R ) for a random variable R with H ( R ) = H ( I ) were considered, where R is independent of both Q and U RL , then for a fixed pair ( Q, R ) the number of matching tuples ( U RL, Q, R ) would be small. This means that the distribution of U RL within a  X  X ucket X  of a given value of R will naturally look homoge-neous, as the bucket is far to small to represent an adequate sample of the random variable U RL . Therefore, condition-ing on any additional variable X , be it IP or R , will always lead to a drop of H ( U RL | Q, X ) compared to H ( U RL | Q ), even if X is independent of both U RL and Q . This problem could potentially be avoided by looking at the cross entropy , i.e. by learning the distribution of the triples ( U RL, Q, IP ) on one set of training data, and then using these probabil-ities to estimate H ( U RL | Q, IP ) on a different set of test data. However, this approach is also problematic as a single URL in the test set, which was unseen in the training set,
We use the term  X  X frican American X  as a short-hand for the term  X  X lack or African-American X  as used in the offi-cial US 2000 census. See http://factfinder.census.gov/ home/en/epss/glossary_r.html#race . would yield an infinite entropy estimate. Ignoring any such unseen URLs will, on the other hand, lead to a biased un-derestimate of the actual entropy. These issues could be ad-dressed by comparing the the empirical conditional entropy H ( U RL | Q, IP ) to H ( U RL | Q, R ) where H ( IP ) = H ( R ) for an independent random variable R . But even then the re-sults would remain difficult to interpret, as it is not clear, for instance, how much a reduction in conditional entropy of 5% would affect the web search results as the entropy might be reduced without changing the ranking of URLs. Hence, we preferred to look at a more tangible measure, the precision at one. Our methodology is described in detail in Section 4.
For this study, we used the following three sources of infor-mation. First, a subset of the query log data for US search traffic of the Yahoo! web search engine. Second, profile in-formation (birth year, gender and ZIP code) provided by registered users. Third, publicly accessible demographic in-formation for US ZIP codes, obtained in the 2000 census 7 and joined with the other data sources on the ZIP code (ex-plicitly provided by users).
The collected data went through the following cleaning and preprocessing steps. First, only web searches issued between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009 were con-sidered. Second, we used a subset of the queries in this time window, sampled uniformly at random. Third, only web searches by users logged into our services were used, and to protect users X  privacy, all user identifiers were hashed using a non-invertible function. Furthermore, during the whole process, nothing was ever aggregated on a per-user level, which is one of the advantages of our proposed approach.
Fourth, only web searches (i) originating from the US-version of the search engine, and (ii) pertaining to users with a valid ZIP code were used. 8 Fifth, queries without clicks on URLs were discarded. We denote the pairs of query and clicked result URL by (query, URL) and when multiple URLs where clicked for the same query, multiple such pairs were generated. Sixth, queries were cast to lower case but no stemming was applied and all special characters (such as apostrophes) were kept. Seventh, immediate, repeated du-plicates of (query, URL) pairs by a single user were conflated to a single instance. Note that we still kept repeated (query, URL) pairs for a single user as long as there were other pairs in between.

The final preprocessing step depended on the final analysis intended and we considered (input, target) pairs of different types. Concretely, in our first set of experiments we ana-lyzed factors predicting the clicked URL (target) for a given query (input). For our second set of experiment, we looked at differences in how different queries (target) are used to describe the same URL (input). For our third set of ex-periments, we investigated potential improvements for  X  X ug-gest as you type X  interfaces and we only used queries which started with a sequence of non-white characters of minimum

Some of the user-provided zip codes were non existent, e.g. 12345, or they corresponded to an area without any regis-tered inhabitants, e.g. 01244. length two (input) followed by another such sequence (tar-get). In the vast majority of cases these sequences were actual terms, but tokens including special characters were also kept. In all three settings, we only used (input, target) pairs where the input had a support of at least two users, i.e. there where at least two matching (query, URL) pairs (after the initial screening) originating from different users.
The remaining (input, target) pairs were then labeled with demographic information derived either directly from the user X  X  profile (birth year and gender) or derived from using demographic information pertaining to ZIP codes. Details of this annotation process are described in the following sec-tion. The sizes of our final data sets are given in Table 1.
Input  X  Target Pairs inputs users query  X  URL 479 M 22.7 M 28.3 M 1st term  X  2nd term 509 M 1.6 M 25.3 M Table 1: Basic statistics for the preprocessed query log used for our study. In all cases, each input was used by at least two distinct users.
Apart from the the birth year and the gender, which were directly provided by the users, we also used the provided ZIP code to annotate each (input, target) pair with additional information. Concretely, we obtained the average values for the following features for each ZIP code: In all cases, the full name is as in the official census infor-mation and, in brackets, is a shorthand used by us. For our current study, we decided to limit ourselves to this subset of features, but in future studies we might also include other available data such as  X  X ean travel time to work in min-utes X  or  X  X verage family size X . Note that the demographic features are not independent and, e.g., areas where a large percentage of the population holds a BA degree tend to have a higher per capita income as well.

The labels applied to each (input, target) pair were dis-cretized. For all demographic features we used quintiles: the percentile intervals [0% , 20%], (20% , 40%], ..., (80% , 100]. E.g., a ZIP code with no more than 12.8% of its popula-tion 25 years and over holding a bachelor X  X  degree would be placed in the lowest quintile for the corresponding fea-ture and, similarly, users born after 1982 would be in the youngest quintile as described in Table 2. Only for (i) the gender, where only two buckets were used, and (ii) the ZIP code itself, where we used only the two leading digits giving a total of 99 buckets, we did not use quintiles. 9 As we were not interested in merely geographical differences, we only
The ZIP prefix 09 refers solely to locations outside the US, but all other prefixes from 00 to 99 were present. See http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_code_prefixes . used the shortened ZIP code to filter out localized queries from the lists in Table 3 but did not use them for anything else. All percentiles were derived from (query, URL) pairs and the corresponding buckets were used in all experiments, even if the percentiles for other (input, target) combinations would have differed slightly. Percentiles were computed on a per query instance basis and not on a per-user basis.
The reason for this discretization is that we explicitly wanted to de -personalize and de -localize our analysis. E.g., using the full birth year could potentially isolate a very small user group and the same holds for using the exact average per-capita income, which would correspond to using the full zip code. Given even larger amount of query log data, one could investigate the differences in web search behavior be-tween users born in, say, 1978 and in 1977, or the differences for the zip codes 95967 and 95969. However, one of the strengths of our approach is exactly the fact that we work with more abstract features, such as  X  X ery young X  (youngest 20%) and  X  X ery old X  (oldest 20%) or  X  X ery rich X  or  X  X ery poor X , thereby allowing a more intuitive interpretation.

Table 2 summarizes the per-query demographics in our dataset, and compares them with averages in the US popu-lation, shown in the last column. 10 Although the averages agree for most features, ZIP codes with a high percentage of African American population appear to be underrepre-sented in our data set. This is consistent with findings on the  X  X acial Divide X  [10]. For birth year, 1974 in the table for US population, only the median and not the (lower) mean birth year was available for the US population. As infants are no web users the average for our data set is expected to be below the US average.
Though it is certain that a fraction of users provided false profile information, sometimes deliberately, and that some of this will have escaped the test for the validity of a ZIP code, our results (Sections 5 and 6) show that the remain-ing signal is still significant. In settings with poorer data quality or without any profile information, approaches to automatically learn a user X  X  profile from her search history seem promising [15].

Instead of using the user-provided zip code, we could have derived the ZIP code by mapping the user X  X  IP address to
Details about the US averages and the definitions of the features can be found at http://factfinder.census.gov/ a geographical location. 11 We did, however, not experiment with this approach as we expect that (i) the accuracy of the mapping is not high enough (as a  X  X oor X  ZIP code can be ge-ographically neighboring a  X  X ich X  ZIP code) and that (ii) the mistakes could have a systematic bias (as internet providers could tend to have their routers in neighborhoods of a par-ticular demographic profile). Still, if sufficiently accurate, such mappings could be used to extend the applicability of our work significantly by enabling a  X  X emographic profiling X  for requests to arbitrary web servers. Information derived from IP addresses could, when the IP-derived location dif-fers significantly from the actual location, also be used to remove false or outdated ZIP code information. For the present study, we opted not to do this and rather to work with the  X  X aw X  data instead.

Note that we do not claim that web users are always rep-resentative of their area. Trivially, any individual user could always deviate in an arbitrary way from the  X  X ypical X  resi-dent of her neighborhood. But even the aggregated averages might not be representative. E.g. in a poor neighborhood the majority of its web users could be made up by people who are, by the local standards, financially better off than their ZIP code would imply. We are only claiming that de-spite such drawbacks our derived  X  X abels X  are still useful for (i) eliciting typical differences (see Section 5) and for (ii) predicting user behavior (see Section 6).
The main objective of our experiments is to measure how much demographic information helps to improve the ranking of targets , e.g. clicked URLs, for a given input , e.g. a given query. More formally, let X , Y and D be random vari-ables corresponding to the input, target and demographic information respectively. Similarly, let x , y and d be ac-tual instances of values of these random variables. In this formulation we want to know how often the mode of the distribution changed, i.e. how often argmax y P ( y | x, d ) 6 = argmax y P ( y | x ). For both conditional distributions we re-quired the two top ranked values to correspond to distinct probabilities, not counting cases of ties as improvements in ranking.

In other words, we looked at the improvement of the  X  X re-cision at one X  (P@1), assuming that (i) the search engine ranks according to the empirical click probability, which is almost always the case 12 , and that (ii) a click is an indication of relevance so that P@1 is identical to the click-through-rate for the value with the highest (empirical) click probability.
For our evaluation, we only considered cases with suffi-cient demographic coverage to possibly allow a re-ranking. Concretely, we only considered inputs x with a support, in the probabilistic sense, of at least 100 users for some some combination ( x, d ) as well as at least 400 users for other val-ues of d . See Table 6 for experimental results for this setup. The alternative possibility of using conditional entropy [3] was discussed in Section 2. Note that we do make use of the conditional entropy for descriptive purposes, in particular in Section 5, but we do not use it for performance evaluation.
See e.g. http://www.hostip.info/ for an open community-based project to map an IP address to geograph-ical locations.
Of course, there is also a feedback loop and the highest ranked results will get clicked more often, independent of their relevance.
We begin by presenting partly anecdotal evidence describ-ing how different demographic groups differ in their web search behavior. Table 3 lists the four most  X  X iscriminating X  queries for different demographic groups, such as very young people, or people living in predominantly  X  X hite X  neighbor-hoods. Queries are ranked by the average feature value, where the average is on a per-query basis; adult queries are not included.

If this were the only ranking criterion, then the list would be dominated by localized queries from single neighborhoods with highly skewed demographic distributions. E.g. the  X  X ichest X  query with a support of at least 16 users would be  X  paws for life  X  (145k$, 43 occurrences, 28 users) and the  X  X ost educated X   X  www.diamondbacks.com  X  (73.3% BA de-gree, 333 occurrences, 22 users). The first refers to an animal charity in Maryland and the second to a baseball team in Arizona. As such examples fail to illustrate the full potential of our approach, for Table 3 we imposed the additional fil-ter that each query must satisfy H (short ZIP | query)  X  4 . 0, where short ZIP refers to the first two digits of a five digit ZIP code. Note that H (short ZIP) = 6 . 23 so that a query with H (short ZIP | query) = 4 . 0 covers about 2 4 . 0 21% of the US. Note that the entropy constraint also leads to the requirement of at least 16 distinct users for each query. The lists are generated such that  X  X iven the query, the de-mographics is determined X , and not the other way around. Many of the queries in Table 3 agree with stereotypes. For example, queries predominantly issued by young users tend to be related to chat rooms, music and social network-ing sites. Queries which are issued exclusively by male users in our sample are related to sports, or computer hard-and software. Queries from areas where a language other than English is often spoken at home, turn out to be written in Spanish. The  X  s2s magazine  X  query, found in the list for the feature  X  X frican American X , refers to a magazine  X  X ov-ering the world of black entertainment X  13 . The query  X  tvb series  X , found in the list for the feature  X  X sian X , refers to a series from a TV station based in Hong Kong.

In some cases the entries are less expected. E.g.  X  www.-unitnet.com  X  is often issued as a web query from ZIP codes where a substantial amount of individuals lives below the poverty line, 26.4% compared to 12.4% US average. This site is the portal page for the  X  X irectors X   X  X alespeople X  of Mary Kay, a brand of skin care and color cosmetics which has been criticized by its opponents as a  X  X roduct-based pyra-mid scheme X  [5]. Also unexpected is the fact that many queries indicative for older people relate to annual share-holder meetings.

Though not our main focus, we also report on observa-tions relating to differences in the actual search process . Table 4 shows that there is a slight but detectable trend for people with a university degree, or at least living in ar-eas where this is more common, to type longer queries, to click more often on a single result, and to click on  X  X eeper X  URLs, meaning that they contain more  X / X  X  X . Query length refers to the number of sequences of non-white-spaces. URL depth refers to the number of parts of a URL separated by a  X / X  and not including the protocol. E.g.  X  sigir X  X  homepage  X  has query length 2 and http://www.sigir.org/ http://www.dmoz.org/Society/Ethnicity/African/ African-American/News_and_Media/Magazines/ Table 3: Some highly-discriminating queries for our demographic features. Note that these queries, though discriminative in terms of P ( D | Q ) , are not necessarily typical for a demographic group in the sense of P ( Q | D ) . For illustrative purposes we show queries with a nation-wide focus by requiring a min-imum entropy of 4.0 over the first two ZIP digits. events/events-upcoming.html has URL depth 3. As for each of the three groups in Table 4 the numbers are com-puted over roughly 95.8M = 0.20  X  479M (query,URL) pairs, these differences, though small, are statistically significant at a confidence level well below 0.001, using a t-test for equality of means. % BA degree query length click entropy URL depth Lowest 20% 2.25 1.74 1.92 Middle 20% 2.28 1.67 1.95 Table 4: People that are more likely to have a uni-versity degree (based on where they live), (i) type longer queries, (ii) click more often on a single result URL, and (iii) click on  X  X eeper X  URLs.

As can already be seen in Table 3, older people tend to be more likely to use URLs as web queries. Out of all 15.7M (query, URL) pairs where the query started with  X  www.  X  29% were due to the  X  X ldest X  quintile, indicating an over-representation of this group for this behavior. Note that such queries are generally more appropriately placed directly in the URL bar of a browser. This can be seen as an indica-tion that older people are on average less experienced with respect to web search.

It is also informative to look at examples of queries q where a demographic group d has an unusually high or low condi-tional click entropy H ( U | q, d ) [3]. A high click entropy can be due to a number of reasons. It can be that the presented web results for that query are poor and people have to try many pages, but it can also be seen an expression of high interest on a potentially multi-faceted topic. For example, the query  X  scrapbooking  X  has a general click entropy of 5.4. But for the youngest quintile, the click entropy increases to 6.8, despite the fact that smaller buckets usually lead to smaller entropies. The same phenomenon holds for the oldest quintile and the query  X  civil war  X .
 Gender G H ( Q | G ) H ( U | Q, G ) H ( U | G ) H ( Q | U, G ) Female 19.04 1.83 19.75 2.77 Table 5: Basic differences in how women and men search the web. The first set of columns is com-puted for the (query,URL) data set and the last two columns for the (URL,query) data set. See Table 1. Both for queries and URLs the uncer-tainty/diversity for men is about 2 . 09 = 6 . 4% higher than for women, even though they show less vari-ability for queries used to describe clicked URLs.
The previous section already demonstrates that there is indeed a difference in search and click behavior between dif-ferent demographic groups. In this section, we investigate if these differences can be exploited to improve web search (Section 6.1), automatic labeling of URLs (Section 6.2) and query suggestions based on query completions (Section 6.3).
As we mentioned in the introduction, for the query  X  wag-ner  X  women predominantly click on the Wikipedia page about the composer and men on the page of a producer of spray brushes. Similarly, most people searching for  X  esl  X  click on the homepage of  X  X SL Federal Credit Union X , but for peo-ple in areas with many households where a non-English lan-guage is spoken at home, the preferred result is a page with background information about the  X  X nglish as a Secondary Language X  exam. Such examples illustrate that knowing a particular demographic feature such as gender can poten-tially help to improve web search results. Here we go beyond anecdotal evidence and quantify the attainable improvement gains.

Applied to all queries with sufficient support (see below), the gains in P@1 are small. This is mostly due to the fact that the baseline system, a large commercial web search en-gine, already has a highly tuned ranking for common queries. Therefore, we also looked at more difficult subsets where the uncertainty of the clicked URL for a given query was large, i.e. where the empirical conditional entropy H ( U | Q ) was above a certain threshold. For these cases, the demographic information is more useful to explain the diversity in the clicked URL.

We selected instances (input, target) where the input has a support of at least 100 users for some demographic feature value d , as well as at least another 400 users for other values of the same feature. P@1 was computed for those instances. The baseline system ranks targets according to P ( y | x ) . Our system ranks them by P ( y | x, d ) . The last column shows the relative gain.
Only cases with sufficient support to reliably use demo-graphic data were used for Table 6. In detail, we required at least 100 users for a particular demographic feature value, such as a quintile for the age, as well as at least 400 users for other values of the same demographic feature. Even though only less than half of the (query,URL) pairs in our original data set (see Table 1) satisfy this criterion, we believe that in practice this fraction can be increased by more aggressive pre-processing of query terms, e.g. (i) by removing spe-cial characters (e.g. conflating  X  men X  X  health  X  and  X  mens health  X ), (ii) by stemming (e.g. reducing  X  cheap flights  X  and  X  cheap flight  X  to singular form) and (iii) by grouping semantically related keys (e.g. combining  X  ny times  X  and  X  new york times  X  into one query).
In the previous section, we looked at (query,URL) pairs and tried to predict the URL for a given query. Here, we look at the dual setting, i.e. given a clicked URL, can we predict the query it was clicked for? Looking at frequently used queries leading to a particular URL essentially helps to give a concise description of a web page, very similar in spirit to using tags to label a page [18]. These descriptions might not be the same across different de-mographic groups. For instance, a marijuana-related page is found by most people using the slang  X  weed  X , whereas people in the oldest quintile use queries with the term  X  marijuana  X  to locate the same page. Apart from being used as labels, the distribution of the queries gives a hint at the function or status of a particular page. E.g., a popular site such as Facebook has a very low entropy in terms of the queries used to find it. As it is almost exclusively  X  X ound X  by navigational queries, it could be called a  X  X avigational URL X , using the terminology from [4]. The page http://www.braces.org is generally found by the query  X  braces  X , arguably an in-formational query. However, people in the highest quin-tile of per-capita income find it predominantly by the query  X  braces.org  X , a navigational query. These are some anecdo-tal examples illustrating differences in how people search for the same web page. Table 6 shows that using demographic information can lead to an improvement in automatically deriving the query for a given URLs of 4.8% in terms of the precision for the highest ranked query.
If a user starts typing the word  X  frontpage  X  on a search engine, what is the most likely term to follow? For most people, it is  X  2003  X , referring to a particular version of the Microsoft software. However, for young people it is  X  free  X , for African Americans it is  X  africa  X  14 , and for people with a high level of education it is  X  magazine  X  15 . In this set of experiments, we evaluated if demographic information could help in predicting the second query term. We used queries having at least two whitespace-separated terms, and having at least two characters in each of the first two terms.
This application shows the largest gain in Table 6. This make intuitive sense as the full query or URL already ab-sorbs a large amount of demographic information. So the earlier the demographic information is used in the process, the larger its predictive value.

Recall that the percentiles used to discretize the demo-graphic features, as described in Section 3.2, were computed for (query,URL) pairs for the web search setting. So the performance for the other two applications can most likely be improved further by adapting the discretization as this leads to a higher entropy H ( D ) and hence to a more dis-criminative predictor.
Our findings in Section 5 are more descriptive than ex-planatory . It would be interesting to investigate why, for ex-ample, different demographic groups prefer different result URLs for the very frequent query  X  swine flu symptoms  X , where people in the lowest quintile concerning a BA degree have http://www.medicinenet.com/swine_flu/article.htm as the single most clicked result as opposed to http:// www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/qa.htm for the rest of the popula-tion, even though both pages appear to be of a similar na-ture. Apart from doing a questionnaire-based user study, one could look at features of the target page, such as the number of images or the average sentence length, or of the http://www.frontpageafrica.com/ is an Africa-centered news and entertainment site. http://frontpagemag.com/ is a political, conservative magazine. result snippet, such as which words were shown. Similarly, features such as the length of a session, the dwell time on a target page or even the percentage of typographical mis-takes in queries could help to improve user modeling. We hope that a better understanding of the differences in how certain demographic groups interact with the web leads to more targeted help for people in need. E.g., one could envi-sion a different web search interface for the elderly.
As our query log data seems to be representative of the whole US population (see Table 2), it lends itself for vari-ous large-scale sociological studies. For instance, it might be possible to investigate different attitudes of different de-mographic groups, such as women vs. men, towards certain off-line issues, e.g. child care, or online issues such as dig-ital privacy concerns [24]. This could be done using both the generated search volume and the type of related search queries for the issue of interest. For instance, we observed that men appear to be more worried about deleting their search history while women tend to be more worried about removing their Facebook profiles. 16 Any study using query logs would be faster, cheaper and have wider coverage than traditional field studies. As a downside there is, on the other hand, more noise and effects due to spam or a small set of highly biased users have to be taken into account for such studies.

We also deem it interesting to investigate algorithms such as HITS [16] to propagate demographic labels back and forth between, say, users and queries. This way a user who often issues  X  X ducated X  queries would gradually be labeled as more and more educated, and queries issued by very educated users would similarly become labeled as more educated. Of course, this approach could be applied to any of the demo-graphic features considered.

Finally, we are looking at a possibility to share our data on a per-query basis for high-volume queries if privacy guaran-tees such as k-anonymity can be given [25]. Releasing query log information aggregated for demographic groups is simi-lar in spirit to releasing census information for a particular ZIP code.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that analyzes the web search behavior of different demographic groups, such as different income ranges or different ethnic groups, for millions of US web users. The simple but im-portant observation that made this possible was the linkage of census information for ZIP codes to user profiles. For most parts, the population of search engine users appears to be a very good approximation of the US population (see Table 2), which highlights the potential of our approach for sociological studies.

It should be emphasized that we could compile lists of queries of people of Asian decent (Table 3) or point at dif-ferences in web search behavior for more educated people (Table 4) without knowing the ethnicity or the education level of a single person. We see this as a big advantage of our approach over more traditional questionnaire based field
For the query  X  how to delete permanently  X  the most-clicked URL for women was http://www.ehow.com/how_ 2315204_delete-facebook-account-permanently.html while for men it was http://www.metacafe.com/watch/ 1267808/how_to_permanently_delete_google_search_ history/ . studies, where demographic profiles need to be collected and stored for individuals, raising privacy concerns.

With respect to the impact of our approach on the web search results of a major web search engine, we demon-strated that a straightforward application of the demographic information led to a 1.4% increase in P@1 averaged among all searches, and an increase of 7.1% in P@1 for the 30% of queries having the larger entropy in their click distribution. See Section 6 for details. Though this might seem small, one has to take into account that (i) the baseline system is already highly optimized and that (ii) the full query itself already  X  X bsorbs X  part of the demographic information, as certain user groups are less likely to issue certain queries. Bigger gains are achievable for query completions as here the demographic information is not yet subsumed by the full query. Changes to interfaces of this kind also have the advantage that users are less likely to be confused by the fact that the ranking of results is different between, say, friends.
Although in principle our methodology is applicable to any country, our current study is limited to the US due to the availability of detailed government census information. In cases where this information is not readily available, ap-plying machine learning techniques seems viable.

Our main purpose was to point out opportunities which arise from using demographic information and we believe that we have barely scratched the surface. We hope to do but also to see more work on this topic in the future.
