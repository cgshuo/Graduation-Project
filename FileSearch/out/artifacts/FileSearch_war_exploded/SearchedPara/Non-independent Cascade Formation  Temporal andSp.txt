 Determining cascade size and the factors affecting cascade size are two fundamental research problems in social net-work analysis. The commonly considered independent cas-cade model, when applied to social networks such as Digg, produces a phase-transition phenomenon where the cascade is either very small or very large. This phenomenon can be explained based on the concept of Giant Propagation Com-ponent (GPC). The GPC is defined as a maximally con-nected component, such that, by applying the independent cascade model, once any node of the component is infected, most of the remaining nodes in the component will eventu-ally become infected with a high probability. While GPC exists in social networks, the phase-transition phenomenon, is not observed in the actual cascade size distribution when the information propagation is due to actions such as  X  X ike X  or  X  X ig X . This paper hypothesizes that the cascade process, i.e. , the likeliness of a node being infected changes over time and depends on how far away the node is from the seed. Furthermore, each node will not be exactly independently considered for infection from each of its infected friends, be-cause the chance of information propagation through  X  X ike X  or  X  X ig X  does not necessarily increase when there are more friends like/dig the information. To this end, we develop and simulate a new non-independent infection cascade pro-cess. The experiment results show that the proposed cascade process generates power-law like cascade size distribution without phase transition, which resembles much better the real-world cascade distribution observed in the Digg social network.

Leskovec et al. [9] discussed the information cascades in blogs, where a cascade is defined as a DAG structure which has a single starting post called cascade seed. Each node of the cascade is a blog post and a child node is any post that contains the parent post X  X  URL. A blog has a link point-ing to another blog if its post refers (contains the URL) to the second blog X  X  post. Each seed creates a cascade, and the information is propagated to other blogs by post re-ferring. They found that most (97%) cascades were trivial (isolated posts); only a very small number of cascades con-tained multiple levels, and the distribution of cascade size follows a power law where the cascade size is the total num-ber of nodes involved in the cascade. Similar observations were found in [6], [2], [1]. With these observations, existing works attempted to develop cascade generation models to explain the cascade process. Kermack et al. [7] proposed the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, and Removed) model to de-scribe the disease infection process among populations and to estimate the likelihood of an epidemic. This infection concept was borrowed and applied to explain the informa-tion propagation. The infection is defined as the process where a person adopts the information after being exposed to the information from her friends. Granovetter et al. [5] proposed a threshold model where each node has a prede-fined threshold. The influence each node receives is the ac-cumulated link weights from its infected friends. The node is infected once the received influence crosses the threshold. Goldenberg et al. [3] defined an independent cascade model that a node is infected by its friends independently with a probability. Leskovec et al. [9] also proposed a simple cas-cade generation model based on this independent cascade model. Besides modeling the cascade process, other stud-ies attempted to predict the cascade size. Given the initial cascade size, Cheng et al. [2] predicted whether the cascade size could be doubled by including the temporal and spatial features. They solved the cascade size prediction as a classi-fication problem, but ignored the step-by-step propagation dynamics. Also, few of the aforementioned studies noticed that the simulated cascade size distribution based on the conventional cascade generation models are very different from the actual cascade size distribution.

This paper attempts to fill the gap by investigating the cascade size and factors affecting the cascade size distribu-tion. A phase-transition phenomenon is found in simulated cascades on the Digg social network using the independent cascade model where the size of a cascade is either very small or very large. Also the probability to have a large size cascade in the actual network is much smaller than the one in the simulated cases. The paper first developed the con-cept of GPC (Giant Propagation Component) to explain the phase-transition phenomenon. While the GPC exists in the social network, the phase transition is not observed in the actual cascades. To explain the difference, this work hypoth-esizes that the cascade size depends on the influence network structure and is also affected by temporal and spatial factors. Furthermore, a non-independent cascade model is proposed to explain the information propagation through  X  X ig/like X  actions, where a node is not infected independently by each of its infected friends, but makes the infection decision upon the aggregated effects of its friends and other temporal and spatial factors.
This section first exhibits the difference between the sim-ulated cascade size distribution and the actual cascade size distribution. For convenience, this paper defines parent and child to represent the friend X  X  relationship as: child  X  parent , where child is watching parent  X  X  activities, and parent can infect child . Table 1 shows the independent cascade gen-eration process which is similar to the cascade generation model of [9].

In Table 1, i is the infected parent of j , P ij is the proba-bility of node i infecting node j . According to [4], P ij be extracted based on the number of same actions done by two nodes over the number of actions done by i . Each simu-lation run generates one cascade. The experiment considers the Digg network as the influence network. The simulated cascade size distribution is shown in Fig.1a by running the simulation 100,000 times. However, it is very different from the actual cascade size distribution 1 as shown in Fig.1b.
There are two differences. The first difference is that there is a phase transition in the simulation, but no such gap in the real cascade size distribution. Steeg et al. [6] observed similar phenomenon, where they assumed all link weights are the same in their experiment. The second difference is that the probability to reach a large cascade in the actual case is much lower, and the distribution is in a power-law shape. The simulation has much higher probability (about 0.0134, 1338 out of 100,000 cascades) to have a large cascade (size
The cascades are generated using the cascades extraction method specified in [9] on Digg dataset [8]. greater than 2500) than the actual cascades (about 0.000008, 15 out of 1780522 cascades).
To explain the first difference, the phase-transition phe-nomenon, we introduce the concept of GPC (Giant Propa-gation Component). The key point of the phase transition is that the cascade is either very large or very small. Intu-itively, to have a large size cascade, the propagation needs to keep on infecting new nodes at each iteration, i.e. , the probability of infecting at least one node must approach 1. Based on the independent cascade model, the probability P of a node i infecting at least one of its children is defined as: where P ij is the probability of node i infecting j ; N ( i ) is the set of children that could be infected by i ; is a very small number. The GPC is the maximally connected component where all nodes of the component satisfy (1). If a node in the GPC is infected, it will infect at least one other node with a high probability; and this newly infected node will attempt to infect another new node. Thus, if any node of the GPC is infected, it will cause a number of other nodes of the GPC being infected with a high probability, and this number is proportional to the size of the GPC 2 . Therefore, the ex-istence of the GPC causes the phase-transition scenario in that: The algorithm to locate the GPC is by continuously pruning nodes that do not satisfy (1). In this way, the GPC found in the Digg network has 310 nodes with = 0 . 01. By selecting any node of the GPC as seed, it will infect most nodes (about 290 out of 310) of GPC, and will eventually infect about 3000 nodes by counting the adjacent nodes of GPC with relevant link infection probability. This numerical estimation is close to the large cascade size of the simulation result shown in Fig.1a. By checking all cascades in Fig.1b with size large than 2500, the infected nodes include most nodes of the derived GPC. This also validates the statement that the
It is possible that all children of infected nodes are already infected, which will cause the propagation to stop. activation of the GPC is the necessary condition of a large cascade.

Since the GPC is related to the infection probability, we want to test whether changing the infection probability will remove the phase transition. The following experiment as-sumes all links weights having the same  X  . Fig.2 shows the cascade size distribution as  X  increases. By increasing the  X  , each node has a higher chance to infect new nodes and the GPC size is larger, and thus, a larger cascade. The phase-transition phenomenon disappears when  X  is too small to support a GPC. Though a low infection probability can eliminate the GPC and phase transitions, it also greatly con-strain the size of a cascade, where no cascade can be large. This shows that changing  X  does not provide a solution to remove the phase transition. Figure 2: Cascade size distribution with different uniform infection probability  X 
The primary issue that causes the GPC is the  X  X ndepen-dent X  infection process. This motivates us to investigate a non-independent cascade model to explain the information propagation in the Digg network. This also accords to the  X  X ig/like X  user experience in the Digg social network and Facebook. Intuitively, people make the  X  X ig/like X  decision by reading the story and influenced by the aggregated re-sult of the parents  X  X ug/liked X  the same story, but not being infected independently by each of their parents.
Besides the phase transition, the other difference is that the probability to reach a large size cascade in the actual cascade size distribution is much lower than the simulation X  X  based on the independent cascade model. In other words, a cascade can reach a large size with only a very small chance. So what prevents a cascade to grow large in the real world? To answer this question, we hypothesize that the infection probability, i.e. , the likeliness of being infected, is affected by several temporal and spatial factors, and consequently af-fects the cascade size. The reason of selecting temporal and spatial factors is based on the intuition that the propagation of the information is dependent on whether the information is new ( temporal ) and whether it is widely ( spatial ) known.
Each story in the Digg network has its lifetime, even for the most popular news. A typical story in the Digg social network will not last for more than a week. This motivates us to think about the attractiveness of the information may constrain a cascade to propagate further. The attractiveness can be represented as the information X  X  infection probability which will decay over time.
The seeds are the nodes adopt the information without being influenced by other nodes but solely attracted by the information. Thus, the number of seeds emerged along the time represents the attractiveness of the information. Imag-ing the  X  X nformation X  as a virtual node, the seeds are in-fected by the information itself. Fig.3 shows the 5%  X  95% percentile of the number of the newly emerged seeds for dif-ferent stories over time. The red square-marker curve is the mean value, and the green diamond-marker curve is the rel-evant exponential function fitting. These curves show that the infection probability from the information itself to the uninfected nodes decays exponentially over time.
Location is defined as the number of hops a node is away from the seed where the information is originated. By mon-itoring the infection happened in the same time period , the dots in Fig.4 represents the normalized infection probabil-ity (defined as the number of infected nodes over the total number of children could be infected) at different locations. The infection probability is smaller if the infection happens farther away from the seed, and the probability decays expo-nentially. The curve shows the fitted exponential function. Figure 4: Exponential fitting of the decay of the infection probability at different locations
Besides the location where the infection happens, another possible factor is the infected parents. According to the in-dependent cascade model [3], the conditional infection prob-ability increases exponentially with the number of infected parents. However, Steeg et al. [6] observed that it is not true; the infection probability almost keeps consistent re-gardless of the number of infected parents in the Digg net-work. We repeated their experiment and verified the re-sult. This also implies that neither the independent cascade model nor the linear threshold model may be applicable in the information propagation of  X  X ig/like X  actions.
Sections 3 and 4 discussed the reasons causing the two differences observed in Fig.1. To overcome the limitation of the current independent cascade model, we propose an  X  X g-gregate cascade model X  by considering the following factors.
The infection waiting time model comes from the distri-bution of the infection time difference between the parent node and its child. Fig.5 shows the waiting time distribu-tion extracted from the actual cascades of the Digg network. Figure 5: Distribution of the infection waiting time in the Digg network dataset
The waiting time distribution follows an exponential dis-tribution 1  X  exp(  X  x  X  ) with  X  = 9 (Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test, sample size 243483, critical value 0.0033, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16). Let  X  l represent the infection waiting time at location l and drawn from this distribution. Table 2 shows the aggregate cascade generation model: In Table 2, K ( j ) is the set of infected parents which can infect j and | K ( j ) | is the size of the set; a =  X  0 . 03 ,b =  X  0 . 2 are derived from Sections 4.1.1 and 4.2.1 accordingly; t is the elapsed time since the moment information is originated estimated by through the infected parents. Fig.6 is the simulated cascade size distribution based on the aggregate cascade algorithm. The distribution is in a power-low like shape without phase transitions, similar to the distribution in Fig.1b. Figure 6: Cascade size distribution with the aggregate cas-cade generation algorithm
This paper analyzed the difference of simulated cascade size distribution based on the independent cascade model from the actual cascade size distribution. GPC is introduced to explain the phase-transition phenomenon; and temporal and spatial factors are investigated to adjust the infection probability. Furthermore, a non-independent cascade model is proposed to better reflect the essence of the information propagation of  X  X ig/like X  actions, where people make infor-mation adoption decision based on the aggregated effects of its parents and other temporal spatial factors.
