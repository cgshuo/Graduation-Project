 HCI and CSCW researchers have begun to call for greater and more explicit support of creative endeavors. Current theories of creativity suggest that it is an inherently collaborative activity, situated and highly contextualized. This work argues that a contextualized view of creativity calls in turn for assessment and technological support to be considered in situ . This poster presents a case study of the creative collaboration in a multimedia arts collective, with the goal of describing their current practices to inform appropriate information system design. We found that even a small and cohesive collaborative arts group contained a multitude of artistic practices and production tool choices, several distinct but interdependent work tracks and a variety of attitudes about the individual members X  collaborative roles. Such heterogeneity, evidenced even within a self-selected and self-organized group, suggests challenges for future technological support of creative practices.

Researchers in human-computer interaction and computer supported cooperative work have begun to suggest a need to study and facilitate creative activity with information systems [5, 10, 11]. The design of information technology for creative practices (ITCP) presents a distinct set of challenges and complications [8]. Creative practices are highly variable, as the  X  X roblems X  they address are, by definition, ill-defined and open-ended [9, 12]. No single model of the creative process has arisen as dominant in the literature [3, 10]. Many current theories of creativity do however emphasize that such activity must be seen as inherently collaborative and social [1]. The expression of creativity is situated and multifaceted: it develops within the context of existing cultural and artistic practices [2, 6], competes in both the economic marketplace and the marketplace of ideas and is dependent on the available technological infrastructure [7]. This complex web of context suggests the need then to ground ITCP design by studying existing collaborative practices in situ , particularly in groups whose medium and/or practices are well suited to technological support. This poster describes a case study of a collaborative group of multimedia artists with the goal of describing their current practices to inform appropriate information system design. We studied MoebiusOne (a pseudonym), a six member, self-described  X  X ultimedia arts collective, X  geographically dispersed across southeast Michigan and Ontario, Canada. Founded in 1998, the group X  X  primary focus is on the production of digital music and video artwork, presented as mixed media performances, static and interactive gallery installation pieces, and recorded compositions for distribution via compact disc and MP3 files. All of the members are men in their thirties, and each has full-time work, school and/or family responsibilities outside of their artistic endeavors. We used two primary methods to evaluate the practices of the group: a questionnaire administered via email and individual face-to-face semi-structured interview sessions. The questionnaire focused primarily on artistic tool usage (e.g. for generation, arrangement, performance, etc.), artistic history and experience as well as perceived closeness of collaboration among various members in the collective. The interview session was framed by the  X  X artnership Descriptors X  matrix from the COSTART project, which assessed the characteristics of successful collaborations between artists and technologists in the domain of digital and interactive art [4]. The interview sessions each took several hours, and were held with five of the six collective members during July and August of 2004. Answers to open-ended survey questions indicated that the actual tools of creation used by each member of the group were numerous, ranging from 6 to 15 individual tools and/or instruments. Among these were a variety of commercial software packages for audio and video creation and editing on both Macintosh and Windows PC platforms, as well as a variety non-software and/or non-digital tools and instruments, including video cameras, guitars, keyboards, DJ turntables and mixers, contact microphones, Minidisc players, photocopiers, and  X  X nk and glue. X  This diverse set of tools suggests the variety of creative practices must be supported in the group. The semi-structured interviews revealed diverse attitudes and perceptions about the collaborative relationships within the group. Most subjects characterized the organization and role assignment of the MoebiusOne collective as  X  X odular. X  While there are particular recurrent roles that individuals take, both artistic and logistical, members X  skills did overlap. Thus, each member was seen as possessing multiple talents and able to shift roles as needed. Depending on scheduling, location and external commitments, a group performance may involve anywhere from one to six members. In the absence of the member that typically fulfills a primary role, such as the liaison with a performance venue audio engineer, enough complementary skill exists for another member to fulfill those duties. Multiple subjects noted that no one member is crucial for the ability of the group to exist, produce and create; there is no single point of failure. This modularity is perceived by the group to be a strength, but also indicates the need for ITCP to support fluid collaborative roles and task assignments. Our analysis also highlighted four distinct but interrelated work tracks within the group, each with specific roles, collaboration patterns and communication norms. First, performance collaboration was described as often being serial in nature. Each performer presents his individual work connected via transition segments to the next member at the event. These transitional or  X  X verlap X  segments were characterized as more improvisational in nature, and were identified several times as being the most overtly collaborative endeavor engaged in by the group. Second, non-performance compositional work was characterized as predominantly solitary in nature, with occasional dyadic couplings. Communication and decision-making about the creative process tended to be implicit and  X  X mbedded X  in the actual process of creation itself. When aesthetic issues were explicitly addressed, such as in planning the themes for the MoebiusOne compact discs, they were spoken of in broad terms, determining only the  X  X ules of engagement. X  Rather than control over process,  X  X ontrol over product X  was emphasized; the expression of a consistent group aesthetic and quality standard in their performances, gallery installations and recorded output was a high priority but as one member stated,  X  X ow we [each] get there is irrelevant. X  The third and fourth work tracks, focusing on logistical and business concerns, were non-aesthetic, more predictable and thus perhaps less  X  X reative X  in character. These were flagged as nonetheless essential to the functioning and sustained existence of the group. In contrast to the implicit, embedded and face-to-face approach to aesthetic communications, these two tracks were enacted most frequently through email, and involved explicit and deliberative consensus building. The combination of implicit and explicit communication process of the four distinct work tracks, coupled with the diversity of tools and flexible roles within this small, self-selected group illustrate the challenge of designing appropriate ITCP. Moreover, this case study suggests that technical support must be flexible and customizable to a particular individual X  X  or collaborative group X  X  situated practices. The wide array of production tools and media utilized in our subjects X  creative work precludes many potential forms of specialized system support for both performance and composition. When group members are asked to alter their choice of tools, they also risk transforming their artistic practice. At the same time, our subject group did indicate a desire to collaborate more frequently and effectively, particularly if support technology was able to help them bridge their separation in time and distance. Future ITCP for groups such as our subjects must leverage this desire for change, but the degree to which a change imposes restrictions upon their artistic expression will largely determine how readily such systems will be adopted. It has been widely recognized in the CSCW literature that problems of adoption frequently occur from forced and/or poorly aligned changes affecting work practices. For creative arts collaboration, the impact of introducing new ITCP may have an overwhelming impact on practice, not unlike being asked to play piano in a marching band.
