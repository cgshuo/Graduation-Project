 The increasing pervasiveness of the Internet has dramatically changed the way that consumers shop for goods. Consumer-generated product reviews have become a valuable source of information for customers, who read the reviews and decide whether to buy the product based on the information pro-vided. In this paper, we use techniques that decompose the reviews into segments that evaluate the individual character-istics of a product (e.g., image quality and battery life for a digital camera). Then, as a major contribution of this paper, we adapt methods from the econometrics literature, specif-ically the hedonic regression concept, to estimate: (a) the weight that customers place on each individual product fea-ture, (b) the implicit evaluation score that customers as-sign to each feature, and (c) how these evaluations affect the revenue for a given product. Towards this goal, we de-velop a novel hybrid technique combining text mining and econometrics that models consumer product reviews as ele-ments in a tensor product of feature and evaluation spaces. We then impute the quantitative impact of consumer re-views on product demand as a linear functional from this tensor product space. We demonstrate how to use a low-dimension approximation of this functional to significantly reduce the number of model parameters, while still provid-ing good experimental results. We evaluate our technique using a data set from Amazon.com consisting of sales data and the related consumer reviews posted over a 15-month period for 242 products. Our experimental evaluation shows that we can extract actionable business intelligence from the data and better understand the customer preferences and ac-tions. We also show that the textual portion of the reviews can improve product sales prediction compared to a baseline technique that simply relies on numeric data.

Consumer product reviews are now widely recognized to have a significant impact on consumer buying decisions [ 6]. Moreover, prior research on consumer decision making has established that consumer-generated product information on the Internet attracts more product interest than vendor in-formation [ 2]. In contrast to product descriptions provided by vendors, consumer reviews are, by construction, more user-oriented: in a review, customers describe a product in terms of usage scenarios and evaluate the product from a user X  X  perspective [ 4]. Despite the subjectivity of consumer evaluations in the reviews, such evaluations are often con-sidered more credible and trustworthy by customers than traditional sources of information [ 2].

The rapid growth of the number of consumer reviews on the Web gave birth to several interesting opinion mining problems. Early work in this area was targeted primarily at evaluating the polarity of the reviews: review sentiments were classified as positive or negative by looking for occur-rences of specific sentiment phrases. Different sources of sentiment phrases were proposed, including manually con-structed dictionaries [ 7], WordNet [ 15],andsearchengine hit counts [ 28]. Machine learning methods were also applied to sentiment-based classification of consumer reviews [ 22]; all methods performed relatively well but failed to achieve high accuracy that is typical for topic-based document clas-sification. Results suggested that sentiment classification of consumer reviews is complicated since consumers may pro-vide a mixed review, praising some aspects of a product but criticizing others. Such heterogeneity stimulated additional research on identifying product features on which consumers expressed their opinions [ 9, 15 X 17, 26, 27]. After identify-ing the product features, it is then possible to use identifi-cation techniques to extract consumer opinions about each feature [ 3, 8, 15, 23].

Ultimately, though, we want to identify not only the opin-ions of the customers, but also want to examine the impor-tance of these opinions. What features do customers value most? What is the relative importance of battery life vs. image quality in a digital camera? Customers may praise or criticize the zoom capabilities of a digital camera, but these discussions may not really affect their decision to buy the product. Current work in opinion mining has not focused on capturing such behavior. Furthermore, current opinion min-ing systems cannot capture reliably the pragmatic meaning of the customer evaluations. For example, is  X  good battery life  X  better than  X  nice battery life  X ? How can we define an objective measure for ranking evaluations?
Towards answering questions of this nature, we propose utilizing the economic context in which the opinions are eval-uated to estimate both the intensity and the polarity of the opinion. In particular, we investigate how product feature evaluations contained in consumer reviews affect product de-mand. Then, by tracing the respective changes in demand, we derive both the weight of the different product features, and the pragmatic  X  X eaning X  of these evaluations, providing actionable intelligence to the manufacturers that are trying to understand consumer behavior. We illustrate the intu-ition behind our approach with this (simplified) example:
Example 1.1. Consider two reviews r A and r B for two similar digital cameras A and B on Amazon.com: review r
A states that the  X  lenses  X  of camera A are  X  excellent  X , while review r B states that the  X  lenses  X  of camera B are  X  good  X . To understand both the polarity and the strength of these evaluations, we observe the changes in sales asso-ciated with these reviews, all other things being equal. We observe that the evaluation  X  excellent lenses  X  increases sales by 5%, while the evaluation  X  good lenses  X  causes sales to drop by 1%. Therefore, we assign the score +5% to the evaluation  X  excellent  X  and the score -1% to the evaluation  X  good . X  In a similar manner, we also observe that the evalu-ations  X  excellent battery life  X  and  X  good battery life  X  X ause a respective change in sales of +2.5% and -0.5%. By com-paring the sales changes associated with the evaluation of  X  battery life  X  with the respective changes associated with  X  lenses , X  we infer that the weight of the  X  lenses  X  X eature is twice as high as the weight of  X  battery life . X 
Our approach is conceptually similar to the hedonic regres-sions that are commonly used in econometrics to identify the weight of individual features in determining the overall price of a product. For example, hedonic regressions are used to identify the marginal value of an extra megapixel in digi-tal cameras. 1 As an important research contribution, we show how to incorporate in a hedonic-like framework qual-itative features, such as  X  X ase of use X  or  X  X mage quality, X  that are not directly measurable and are ignored in exist-ing economics and marketing research. Towards adapting a hedonic-like framework, we model qualitative consumer opinions as quantitative evaluation scores and then model consumer reviews as elements in a tensor product of feature space and evaluation space. To study the impact of con-sumer reviews on the product demand, we represent review impact as a linear functional in this tensor product. Finally, we show how to use a rank constraint for this functional to significantly reduce the number of model parameters, while still providing good experimental results. Our experimental evaluation over a real data set of 242 products monitored over a 15-month period on Amazon.com shows the valid-ity of our approach and provides significant insights on the behavior of consumers who buy products online.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the background for the paper. Section 3 presents our hybrid model that combines econometrics and text mining for analyzing consumer reviews using product demand. Sec-tion 4 discusses our experimental setting and results, ob-tained over two big product categories. Finally, Section 5 discusses related work and Section 6 provides further dis-cussion and concludes the paper.
In this section, we give the necessary background for this paper. In Section 2.1, we give a brief description of hedo-nic regressions, which can be considered as the microeco-nomic framework in which our model is embedded in. Then, Section 2.2 describes existing techniques for product feature identification from consumer reviews and Section 2.3 briefly discusses existing approaches for identifying consumer opin-ions from product reviews.
The hedonic model assumes that differentiated goods can be described by vectors of objectively measured features and the consumer X  X  valuation of a good can be decomposed into implicit values of each product feature [ 24]. Hedonic mod-els are designed to estimate the value that different product aspects contribute to a consumer X  X  utility. Implicit in the hedonic price framework is the assumption that a particular product can be viewed as consisting of various bundles of a small number of characteristics or basic attributes [ 1]. For instance, a backpacking tent can be decomposed to charac-teristicssuchasweight( w ), capacity ( c ), and pole mate-rial ( p ), and the tent utility can be represented as a function u ( w,c,p,... ). Various restrictions can be put on the utility function. For example, it is often assumed that the utility function is monotonic, increasing, and concave to satisfy the  X  X aw of diminishing marginal utility X  [ 25]. In brief, the he-donic hypothesis is based on the notion that heterogeneous goods are an aggregation of individual characteristics. It is important to point out that not all product categories are consistent with the assumptions of the hedonic frame-work. For example, while consumer appliances fit well into the hedonic model, products such as movies or books do not have clear utilitarian characteristics and are not typically classified as hedonic products. In order to avoid potential complexities arising from applying the model to non-hedonic products, in this paper we consider hedonic goods only.
The primary weakness of the existing hedonic models is the need to identify manually product features and mea-surement scales for them. In traditional hedonic regressions (i.e., those used by the BLS 2 to calculate the CPI) the de-cision of what features to include and how to measure them is made by individuals. This can lead to a bias from subjec-tive judgments of these individuals. Furthermore, features that cannot be easily measured (e.g., image quality, style) are commonly ignored.
In an orthogonal direction to economic research, the prob-lem of identifying product features has been studied exten-sively in the last few years in the data mining and natu-ral language processing communities. Many techniques use a part-of-speech tagger to annotate each review word with its part-of-speech (POS), identifying whether the word is a noun, an adjective, a verb and so on. Nouns and noun phrases are popular candidates for product features, though other constructs (like verb phrases) can be used as well. Alternative techniques search for statistical patterns in the text, for example, words and phrases that appear frequently in the reviews [ 8]. For example, Hu and Liu [ 16] use asso-ciation rule mining to find frequent n -grams 3 in consumer product reviews and use these n -grams as candidate features. Hybrid methods are also developed by combining both ap-proaches, where a POS-tagger is used as a preprocessing step before applying association mining algorithm to discover fre-quent nouns and noun phrases [ 19, 23]. An alternative tech-nique for discovering product features that are not explicitly mentioned in the review is to use a classifier [ 9] that deter-mines whether a particular feature is discussed (implicitly) in the review or not.
Of course, identifying product features per se is not the end goal. The important goal is to understand what the customer X  X  opinion is about each of the identified product features. An increasingly popular trend in opinion mining is in combining feature mining and sentiment identification techniques to extract consumer opinions in form of feature-based summaries [ 3, 8, 15, 23]. Though technical details may differ, the proposed algorithms usually consist of three basic steps. In the first step, a feature mining technique is used to identify product features. In the second step, the algorithms extract sentences that give (positive or neg-ative) opinions for a product feature. Finally, a summary is produced using the discovered information. Unfortunately, the existing approaches could not provide reasonable quan-titative evaluations of product features. In most cases, the evaluation of a product feature was done in a binary scale (positive or negative). It is also possible to have a count-ing scale that computes the number of positive and negative opinion sentences for a particular feature; such counts can be used for feature-based comparison of two products (see, for example [ 19]). Such a comparison tool is undoubtedly useful for consumers using an online shopping environment. Unfortunately, such techniques fail to identify the strength of the underlying evaluations, and do not show the impor-tance of the underlying feature in the consumer X  X  purchasing process. In this paper we show how to address these issues by taking into consideration the economic context into which the opinions are being evaluated.
In this section, we describe our econometric approach for modeling and analyzing consumer reviews. In Section 3.1, we present our approach for identifying the opinions of con-sumers about product features. Then, in Section 3.2,we show how to represent consumer reviews as elements of a tensor product space and in Section 3.3, we describe our econometric approach for measuring the weight of the in-dividual product features, and the implicit evaluation score that a consumer review assigns to each feature.
In the first step of our approach, we need to identify the Var Dim Description F feature space E evaluation space R review space V basisofreviewspace
D kt R demand for the product k at time t  X  R constant term  X  R price elasticity of demand p kt R price for the product k at time t
W kt R mn consumer review component, see Eq. 1  X  R m vector of evaluation weights  X  R n vector of feature weights, ||  X  || 2 =1 product features mentioned in the reviews and the respec-tive consumer evaluations. Recall that in the hedonic model each product can be characterized by a vector of its features X =( ef 1 ,..., ef n ), where each vector element ef i repre-sents the quality level of the corresponding feature. In our current work, we rely on existing approaches to identify the product features in the text. Specifically, we assume that each of the n features can be expressed by a noun, chosen from the set of all nouns that appear in the reviews. For example, for a digital camera dimension 1 might be  X  lens  X , dimension 2 might be  X  size  X , dimension 3 might be  X  shut-ter  X . 4 Furthermore, to avoid overfitting, we only considered as features the nouns that appeared frequently in our data set. (We provide more details in Section 4.1.)
After identifying the product features, we need to identify the consumer evaluation of product feature quality. We rely on the observation [ 15, 29] that consumers typically use ad-jectives, such as  X  bad , X   X  good , X  and  X  amazing  X  X oevaluate the quality of a product characteristic. Therefore, we use a syntactic dependency parser to identify the adjectives that modify a noun that we have identified as product feature.
The result of this technique is a set of noun-adjective pairs that correspond to pairs of product features and their respec-tive evaluations . We refer to these pairs as opinion phrases . It should be noted that such opinion phrases cannot capture all opinion information contained in consumer reviews. We would like to emphasize though that the goal of this paper is not to develop new techniques for identifying product fea-tures or phrases that evaluate such features. 5 Rather, we are interested in measuring the weight that customers place in each product feature and the implicit evaluation score (po-larity and strength) associated with each feature evaluation. The core contributions of this paper are described next.
Existing consumer review mining approaches tend to con-sider extracted product features and opinions as simple sets and no algebraic structure is imposed on these sets. In order to use the concepts similar to hedonic regressions, we need to represent the product demand as a function from the space of consumer reviews. Such representation assumes a vector space structure on the set of feature opinions. To construct such structure, we build two vector spaces: one for product features and one for feature evaluations.

We model multiple sets of n product features as elements of a vector space over R with basis f 1 ,...,f n .Wedenote this feature space as F , (dim F = n ). In the same way, we define a space of evaluations as a vector space over R with basis e 1 ,e 2 ,...,e m . Wedenotethis evaluation space as
E (dim E = m ). Intuitively, when we represent a review r in the feature space F , the representation contains the weights that customers assign to each product feature. Sim-ilarly, when we represent a review r in the evaluation space E , the representation contains the implicit evaluation scores that the review assigns to a product feature (notice that the evaluations in the space E are not bound, yet, to any specific feature).

Now, based on the algebraic structures in the feature and the evaluation space, we can represent the opinion phrases and whole consumer reviews as elements of the review space R that we define as the tensor product of the evaluation and feature spaces : Note that the set of opinion phrases f i  X  e j form a basis of the space R and we denote this basis as V .

Now, each review can be represented as a vector in the re-view space R : we only need to determine the weight that we assign to each dimension of R to represent the review. There are several different ways to determine the weight of an opin-ion phrase in a text corpus (e.g., tf.idf weights). In our work, we use a standard term frequency measure that discounts influence of longer reviews and calculates the weight of the opinion phrase phrase in review rev for product prod as: where N ( y, r, p ) is the number of occurrences of the opinion phrase y in the consumer review r for product p ,and s is a  X  X moothing X  constant. 6 Notice that using our convention, the sum of the weights of the opinion phrases within each review is equal to one, discounting the influence of longer reviews.

Example 3.1. Consider the following review for a digital camera:  X  The camera is of high quality and relatively easy to use. The lens are fantastic! I have been able to use the LCD viewfinder for some fantastic shots... To summarize, this is a very high quality product.  X  This review can be represented by the following element of the tensor product, assuming s =0 : Notice that each opinion phrase dimension has a weight co-efficient determining its relative importance in the review. Since the opinion phrase quality-high appears twice in the review, the weight of this dimension is 0.4, in contrast to all the other opinion phrases that appear only once and have weight equal to 0.2.

So far, we have discussed how to represent reviews in an algebraic form. While we could achieve a similar result by simply defining directly a space of opinion phrases and then represent each review as a vector in this space, we will see next that our tensor space approach has significant analytic advantages over this simpler approach. Specifically, we will see that the tensor space approach will allow us to estimate naturally the weight of each product feature and the implicit score of each evaluation, using relatively small training sets and avoiding the problems of data sparsity and of overfitting. Next, we describe our approach in detail.
A simple econometric technique for modeling product de-mand as a function of product characteristics and its price, is the following simple linear model: where D kt is the demand for the product k at time t , p kt its price at time t ,  X  is the price elasticity, and a k is a prod-uct specific constant term which captures the unobserved product heterogeneity, such as differences in product char-acteristics and brand equity. The variable  X  kt represents a random disturbance factor which is usually assumed to be normally distributed, i.e.,  X  kt  X  N (0 , X  2 ). This is a clas-sical ordinary-least-squares (OLS) regression with product level fixed effects and the parameters can be estimated us-ing standard panel data methods [ 31].

A potential drawback of such a model is that it can not be used to evaluate separately different product characteristics because it mixes all product features into the single term a Another limitation is time invariant nature of the product specific effect. Though the technical characteristics of the product typically stay the same during the product X  X  life cycle, its popularity may change as a result of consumer evaluations of the product.

We extend the model using our original assumption that qualitative consumer reviews correspond to some quantita-tive evaluations of product characteristics. Such evaluations cannot be measured directly but can be learned from prod-uct demand fluctuations, if a sufficiently large data set is available. We replace the product specific effect a k by a sum of two components: wherewehave The vector W kt (for fixed k and t ) contains the weights of all opinion phrases that appeared in the consumer reviews for product k available at time t . (Essentially, we take the vectors that represent the consumer reviews posted by time t and  X  X ollapse X  them into a single vector.) For simplicity, we compute these weights by averaging 7 the weights for each opinion phrase across all reviews posted until time t .
In Equation 3, we represented the impact of a set of con-sumer reviews on the product demand as some generic func-tional  X  : R  X  R . Similar to hedonic regressions, we assume that the functional form is linear and formally this can be written as  X   X  R  X  where R  X  is the dual space of R (space of linear functionals). A linear functional from a tensor product of two vector spaces is just a bilinear form of two parameters, so  X  is just a bilinear form of features and evaluations. Any linear functional can be written in the basis representation:
 X ( W kt )= where  X  ( x )=  X  ( f i  X  e j ) is the value of the functional on the basis vector f i  X  e j . Intuitively, the value of  X  ( x )isthe influence of the opinion phrase f i ,e j , which in turn is a function of the weight of feature f i (when evaluated by e and of the implicit score that e j assigns to f i .Continuing the example from Section 3.2, we can write the value of the functional on the sample consumer review as: Using Equations 2 and 3, we have our extended linear model: Unfortunately, this model has a very large number of param-eters and would require a very large training set of product reviews to estimate. In the case where we have n product features and m evaluation words for N products with similar features, the number of model parameters will be n  X  m + N . Since, we rarely have more than 30 reviews for a product, model overfitting is definitely a problem.

To alleviate this problem, we reduce the model dimension by placing a rank constraint on the matrix  X . In other words, we are not going to search for any linear function but only for those with low matrix ranks. The approach is based on the following observation.

Theorem 3.1. (Singular Value Decomposition) Any linear functional  X   X  R  X  such that rank X =rank(  X  ij )  X  p can be represented as p i =1  X  i  X   X  i where  X  i  X  F  X   X   X  E  X  and ||  X  i ||
Corollary 3.1. Any linear functional  X   X  R  X  such that rank( X ) = rank(  X  ij )=1 can be represented as  X   X   X  where  X   X  F  X  and  X   X  E  X  and ||  X  ||
Corollary 3.1 shows how to model features and evaluations as independent multiplicative components. We can replace a complex functional from R  X  by a product  X   X   X oftwo simple functionals  X   X  F  X  and  X   X  E  X  .Inotherwords, we assume that each coefficient  X  ( x ) can be decomposed as a product of the feature component (defining importance of the feature) and the evaluation component (determining relative weight of the evaluation). For example: The resulting approach is similar to ANOVA decomposi-tion, which is frequently used to reduce model complexity for multidimensional splines and generalized additive mod-els [ 14]. Our model, though, operates in different context because features and evaluations do not represent indepen-dent dimensions of consumer reviews: each evaluation word occurrence describes some feature and each feature word oc-currence relates to some evaluation.

One limitation of this rank-1 approximation is the restric-tion that each adjective has one meaning, independently of the feature that it evaluates. While this restriction might seem too strict, we observed that it worked well for our set-ting. We should note though that our approach allows flex-ibility in the approximation approach. If we would like to assign two potential meanings for each adjective, we can use a rank-2 approximation, allowing two meanings per adjec-tive and two potential weights for each feature (e.g., negative evaluations may have high influence when evaluating a fea-ture, but positive evaluations may have low weight). In this case, the functional  X  would simulate a mixture model and have the form  X  =  X  1  X  1 +  X  2  X  2 . (Of course, estimating such a model would require a larger number of training examples.) Similarly, we can use even higher rank approximations, al-lowing more meanings per adjective, but we would need more training data to avoid overfitting.

Using the rank-1 approximation of the tensor product functional, we rewrite the model of Equation 3.3 as: where  X  is a vector that contains n elements corresponding to the weight of each product feature, and  X  is a vector that contains the implicit score that each adjective assigns to a product feature. The new model has only m + n +1+ N parameters instead of original n  X  m +1+ N , but this is achieved by sacrificing the linearity of the original model. Despite the loss of linearity, we can still search for the max-imum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the model parameters. Assuming that  X  kt are independent and identically normally distributed residuals, the ML estimate is the same as the minimum of the least-squares fit function: (  X   X  , X   X  , X   X  , X   X  )= One of possible approaches to parameter estimation is to use the Newton-Rhapson method, or its variations, to search for the minimum. Unfortunately the Newton-Rhapson algo-rithm convergence suffers from numerical difficulties, in par-ticular, ill-conditioning of the Hessian in the neighborhood of the solution. To solve the problem, we propose a different iterative algorithm. Our algorithm is based on the observa-tion that if one of the vectors  X  or  X  is fixed, the Equation 4 represents a linear model. The steps of the algorithm are described below: 1. Set  X  to a vector of initial feature weights. 2. Minimize the fit function by choosing the optimal eval-3. Minimize the fit function by choosing the optimal fea-4. Repeat Step 2 and 3, until the algorithm converges. Note that the algorithm described above (and the Newton-Rhapson algorithm as well) may converge to some local min-imum of the fit function. To compensate for such potential errors, we repeat the execution of the algorithm with multi-ple, randomly generated, initial starting points.
Summary: In this section, we have presented our ap-proach for estimating the weights of the different product features and the implicit scores that the adjectives assign to the product features. We have presented how to use a low-rank approximation of the review space to estimate these values, and presented an efficient algorithm for estimating the parameters of our model. Next, we present the experi-mental evaluation of our approach.
In this section, we validate our techniques on a data set covering 242 products drawn from the product categories  X  Audio &amp; Video  X  X nd  X  X amera &amp; Photo X  sold on Amazon. We first describe our data set (Section 4.1). Then, in Sec-tion 4.2, we describe how we run our text mining algorithm to identify the product features and the evaluations. In Sec-tion 4.3, we present the exact setup of our econometric-based technique, and, in Section 4.4 we discuss the experimental findings that show that our techniques can provide action-able business intelligence and can give useful insights on how customers behave when shopping online.
We gathered data on a set of products using publicly avail-able information at Amazon.com. The data set covered two different product categories:  X  X amera &amp; Photo X  (115 prod-ucts) and  X  X udio &amp; Video X  (127 products). During a 15-month period (from March 2005 to May 2006), we have been collecting daily price and sales rank information for the prod-ucts in our data set, using the API provided by Amazon Web Services. In the  X  X amera &amp; Photo X  category we had 31,233 observations and in the  X  X udio &amp; Video X  category we had 35,143 observations. Each observation contains the collec-tion date, the product ID, the price on Amazon.com (which includes a possible Amazon discount), the suggested retail price, the sales rank of the product, and the average product rating according to the posted consumer reviews. Addition-ally, we used Amazon Web Services to collect the full set of reviews for each product. Each product review has a numer-ical rating on a scale of one to five stars, the date the review was posted and the actual text posted by the reviewer. We collected 1,955 reviews in the  X  X amera &amp; Photo X  category and 2,580 reviews in the  X  X udio &amp; Video X  category, overlap-ping with our sales rank observations. Thus, each product had about 20 reviews on average. Figures 1 and 2 show dis-tributions of the number of consumer reviews per product in the  X  X udio &amp; Video X  and  X  X amera &amp; Photo X  categories. A Figure 1: Distribution of the number of consumer reviews per product (Audio &amp; Video) Figure 2: Distribution of the number of consumer reviews per product (Camera &amp; Photo) few outlier products, with more than 50 reviews, are not dis-played on the figures. For example, in the  X  X udio &amp; Video X  category Apple 1GB iPod Shuffle had 271 consumer reviews.
In order to determine the set of product features and eval-uation words to use, we applied a simple approach consisting of three steps. First, we used the part-of-speech tagger de-veloped by the Stanford NLP Group, to analyze all reviews and assign a part of speech tag to each word. Second, a set of frequent nouns was extracted from the tagged review corpus. The second step tends to produce a significant num-ber of infrequent, non-relevant items. Fortunately, the set of frequent nouns was relatively small (about 800 items per category). Since, our work is not focused on product feature identification from product review, we decided to quickly process the list of frequent items, and manually select a sub-set of approximately 30 nouns to use as product features. For example, in the  X  X amera &amp; Photo X  category the set of features included  X  X attery/batteries, X   X  X creen/lcd/display, X   X  X oftware, X   X  X iewfinder, X   X  X ens/lenses, X  and so on. To iden-tify the set of evaluations, we used the syntactic dependency parser from the Stanford NLP toolkit, and we extracted the adjectives that evaluated the selected product features. The set of evaluations contained popular adjectives describing the level of satisfaction with each particular feature. Words like  X  X mazing, X   X  X ad, X   X  X reat, X   X  X xceptional, X  and  X  X ut-standing X  appeared frequently in our data set. We kept the list of 30 most frequent adjectives to create our evaluation space. We used the same set of evaluation words for both product categories, but, of course, the set of features was different in each category.
In order to evaluate our techniques using data from Ama-zon, we had to modify slightly the model of Section 3.3. Specifically, Amazon.com doesn X  X  report the demand for the products available on the web site. Instead, Amazon.com reports a sales rank figure for each product, which ranks the demand for a product relative to other products in its cat-egory . Prior research in economics and in marketing (for instance, [ 5, 11]) has associated these sales ranks with de-mand levels for products such as software and electronics. The association is based on the experimentally observed fact that the distribution of demand in terms of sales rank has a Pareto distribution (i.e., a power law) [ 5]. Basedonthis observation, it is possible to convert sales ranks into demand levels using the following Pareto relationship: where D is the unobserved product demand, S is its observed sales rank, and a&gt; 0, b&lt; 0 are industry-specific parameters. Therefore, we can use the log of product sales rank on Ama-zon.com as a proxy of the log of product demand. We also modified the model of Section 3.3 to include both the sug-gested retail price ( P 1 ) and the price on Amazon.com ( P since its natural to expect the prices will influence product demand, besides word-of-mouth. Furthermore, we included the review rating variable ( R ), which represented the aver-age numeric rating of the product as given by the reviews.
Our model predicts the product sales rank based on its price, average review rating, and a set of consumer reviews. Note that as defined before, the review-level variables are the ones published before a given observation date. 8 Us-ing our model, we analyze how different feature-evaluation combinations affect sales, after controlling for product price. The transformed equation is given below: ln( S kt )=  X  +  X  1  X  R kt +  X  2  X  ln( P 1 kt )+  X  3  X  ln( P In the above equation, W kt is the  X  X eview matrix X  (see Section 3.3)and W ktij was calculated using Equation 1. We found that due to sparsity of the review data if we use a large number of features and evaluations, our model tends to overfit the noise in the training data set. To al-leviate this concern, we added the regularization constraint model to a  X  X idge regression X  [ 14]. Note that due to negli-gible correlation 9 between the list and retail prices, multi-collinearity is not a concern in our model. Our results are also robust (and similar to the reported ones) if we were to only use the retail price in Equation 6.
Predicting Future Sales: After obtaining the review matrix, we used 10-fold cross-validation to test the model X  X  performance and obtain reliable coefficient estimates. The original sample was partitioned into 10 sub-samples of prod-ucts. 10 Of the 10 sub-samples, a single sub-sample was retained as validation data for testing the model, and the remaining 9 sub-samples were used as training data. The cross-validation process was repeated 10 times and each of the 10 sub-samples was used exactly once as validation data.
For our experiments, we run our regression on the train-ing data and derived the coefficients for each of the regres-sors. After deriving the coefficients from the training set, we tested how well the derived regressions predicts the sales rank for the products in the test set. We compared per-formance for predicting sales rank, using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics, averaged over all the observations in the test set. We compared our model with the same model that has no consumer review text available (but including all other vari-ables). We observed a 5% improvement in RMSE and 3% improvement in MAE. To test for statistical significance we used the Wilcoxon 11 signed rank test ( p&lt; 0 . 001). We should note that the 5% improvement is a significant achievement, given the high volatility of Amazon sales rank information, the fact that the numeric rating information is already taken into account (both models contained average rating of con-sumer reviews as a variable) and the fact that we are mea-suring errors in log-scale. This result indicates that the text of the reviews contains information that influences the be-havior of the consumers, and that the numeric ratings alone cannot capture the information in the text.

Estimating Product Feature Weights and Evalua-tion Scores: The other significant contribution of our work is the ability to identify the product feature weights and the evaluation scores associated with the adjectives, within the context of an electronic market.

Tables 2 and 3 present the average feature and evaluation coefficients that were obtained for the 49 digital cameras from the  X  X amera &amp; Photo X  category. The coefficients were averaged across cross-validation runs to produce reliable es-timates and empirical standard error values. We should also note that we excluded the rating variable from the regres-sion, in order to obtain feature and evaluation coefficients that are not detrended with respect to numeric review rat-Table 2: Feature weights for the Camera &amp; Photo category. Higher weight values signify higher im-portance of each attribute. (The  X  symbol indicates statistical significance at the 5% confidence level.) Table 3: Some evaluation scores for the Camera &amp; Photo category. Higher scores mean increase in sales rank and are therefore negative . Lower values are better. (The  X  symbol indicates statistical signifi-cance at the 5% confidence level.) ings. Note that higher values of evaluation coefficients sig-nify increase of the sales rank and, therefore, have negative impact on product sales.

We should note that making conclusions based on the in-dividual model coefficients may be incorrect, due to model complexity and interaction effects between coefficients. So, in addition to the raw coefficients, we also calculated the par-tial effects for frequent opinion phrases. The partial effect of a opinion phrase x = e  X  f is defined as  X  T  X   X  W x kt  X  where  X  W kt is the  X  X verage review X  obtained by averaging all consumer reviews in this product category with proper normalization and  X  W x kt is the  X  X verage review X  where all evaluations of the feature f were replaced by the evaluation e . For example, to calculate a partial effect of the  X  X olid lens X  phrase ( f = lens , e = solid ) we take the  X  X verage dig-ital camera review X  and replace all evaluations of the  X  X ens X  feature to  X  X olid X . This enables us to simply calculate the difference between the modified review score and the average review score. The calculated partial effects for the  X  X amera &amp; Photo X  product category are presented in Table 4.Re-member, that a negative sign on an opinion phrase denotes the fact that there is an increase in sales (since sales rank on Amazon is inversely proportional to demand) when that  X  X pinion feature X  is present in the content of the product review.

We observed that seemingly positive evaluations like  X  X e-cent quality X  or  X  X ice/fine camera X  end up hurting sales. Even though this may seem counterintuitive, it actually re-flects the nature of an online marketplace: most of the posi-tive evaluations contain superlatives, and a mere  X  X ecent X  or  X  X ine X  is actually interpreted by the buyers as a lukewarm, Table 4: Partial Effects for the Camera &amp; Photo product category: A negative sign signifies decrease in sales rank and means higher sales. slightly negative evaluation. Furthermore, we observed only a small number of unambiguously negative evaluations, such as  X  X ad X  and  X  X orrible X : products that get bad reviews, tend to disappear from the market quickly, and do not get many further negative evaluations. In general, the reviews that appear on Amazon are positive, especially for products with large number of posted reviews. Finally, a strange ob-servations is that the evaluations  X  X est camera, X   X  X xcellent camera, X   X  X mazing camera, X   X  X erfect camera, X  and so on, have a negative effect on demand. This puzzling result may be caused by the fact that most of the reviews praising the camera in general do not usually have many details about the product features of the camera. Customers discount such reviews, and potentially treat them as bogus: a review that simply says that a camera is the  X  X est camera X  in the mar-ket, without going into other details does not provide useful information to the customer and has negative effect on sales.
Evaluation Conclusions: We have presented our exper-imental evaluation of our technique by presenting results on a real data set from Amazon.com. Our results show that we can identify the features that are important to consumers and that we can derive the implicit evaluation scores for each adjective, in an objective and context-aware manner. Deriving the polarity and strength of an evaluation was gen-erally considered a hard problem, but by evaluating an opin-ion within an economic framework, we showed that we can solve the problem in a natural manner. Furthermore, our technique takes into consideration the peculiarities of the environment in which the opinion is evaluated. Weak posi-tive opinions like nice and decent are actually evaluated in a negative manner in electronic markets, since customers are used to see only strong positive opinions, and a mere nice or decent is a bad signal to the buyers.

Our paper adds to a growing literature on sentiment analy-sis. Similar to almost any other sentiment mining technique, the first step involves selecting the set of features to use (see Section 2.2). Our approach to feature selection is very close to the one presented by Hu and Liu [ 15]. Hu and Liu used a POS-tagger and association miner to find frequent item-sets, which are then treated as candidate features. For each instance of a candidate feature in a sentence, the nearby adjective (if there is such) was treated as the effective opin-ion .Notethat effective opinions used by Hu and Liu are direct counterparts of evaluation words in our study. A ma-jor difference of our approach is that whereas Hu and Liu were interested in the effectiveness of feature extraction and high recall values, we are concerned about gathering a small set of major features and evaluation words. In order to en-sure that gathered features reflect hedonic characteristics of the products, we performed manual post-processing of fre-quent itemsets. Contrary to Hu and Liu, who performed additional research to identify infrequent features, we inten-tionally discarded such features to obtain robust estimates of model coefficients. It should also be noted that while Hu and Liu used WordNet to identify polarity of opinion words, our model evaluates polarity and strength of each evaluation directly from the regression on product demand.

Our research was inspired by previous studies about opin-ion strength analysis. Popescu and Etzioni [ 23]presented OPINE, an unsupervised information extraction system ca-pable of identifying product features, identifying user opin-ions regarding product features, determining polarity of the opinions and ranking the opinions based on their strength. Unfortunately, so far, no paper was published explaining how OPINE solves the last task (opinion ranking). Eval-uating strength of a sentiment quantitatively is even more challenging task than simple ranking and there were just a few papers on the topic published thus far. Wilson, Wiebe and Hwa [ 30] presented a supervised learning approach able to distinguish between weak, medium and strong subjectiv-ity of the opinion. Unfortunately, this technique requires a manually annotated corpus of opinions. Human annota-tors might not able to distinguish strength of opinions on a finer-grained scale or estimate economic impact of each particular opinion. In a close stream of research, Pang and Lee [ 21] studied the rating-inference problem. They aug-mented SVM classifier with a metric labeling concept and applied the altered classifier to infer the author X  X  numerical rating for Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews.

We also add to an emerging stream of literature that com-bines economic methods with text mining [ 7, 10, 18]. For example, Das and Chen [ 7] examined bulletin boards on Ya-hoo! Finance to extract the sentiment of individual investors about technology companies. They have shown that the ag-gregate tech sector sentiment predicts well the stock index movement, even though the sentiment cannot predict well the individual stock movements. There has also been re-lated work on studying connections between online content such as blogs, bulletin boards and consumer reviews, and consumer behavior, in particular purchase decisions. Gruhl et al. [ 13] analyzed the correlation between online mentions of a product and sales of that product. Using sales rank information for more than 2,000 books from Amazon.com, Gruhl et al. demonstrated that, even though sales rank mo-tion might be difficult to predict in general, online chatter can be used to successfully predict spikes in the sales rank.
To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to use econometric approaches for analyzing the strength and polarity of consumer review opinions. Contrary to Gruhl et al. who used blogs as the indicator of spikes in the sales rank, our research is based on the premise that changes in sales rank, can be partially explained by the impact of con-sumer reviews. We draw on the results of Chevalier and Mayzlin [ 6] who have shown that online book ratings affect product sales by examining the relationship between rela-tive market shares (sales rank) and consumer reviews across the two leading online booksellers, Amazon.com and Bar-nesandNoble.com. Comparing the sales and reviews of a given book across the two sites, allows to control for exter-nal factors that can affect the sales and word-of-mouth of both retailers (for example, release of a new Harry Potter movie may result in a temporary increase of the correspond-ing book sales). While our research is similar to the study by Chevalier and Mayzlin, it does differ in several signifi-cant ways. While the model in [ 6] included only numerical rating information (such as average star rating and fraction of 1 star and 5 star reviews), our approach employs text mining to extract consumer opinions about different prod-uct features. Contrary to the work in [ 6], we were not able to use multiple retailers in our experimental study. In order to alleviate possible concerns from the influence of external fac-tors or measurement errors on our coefficient estimates, we used 10-fold cross validation of the model to precisely infer product-specific characteristics. We found that our results are robust across products.
We have presented a novel method for mining consumer reviews that combines existing text mining approaches with econometric techniques. The major novelty of our tech-nique is that it allows an economic-aware analysis of the con-sumer reviews, identifying the weight that customers place on individual product features and the polarity and strength of the underlying evaluations. By using product demand as the objective function, we derive a context-aware inter-pretation of opinions and we show how customers inter-pret the posted comments and how they affect their choices. We have presented examples, where opinions that would be interpreted as positive by existing opinion mining sys-tems, are actually negative within the context of electronic markets. The source code with our implementation, to-gether with the data set used in this paper are available from http://economining.stern.nyu.edu .
 Using a unique data set from a leading online retailer, Amazon, we have demonstrated the value of using economic data and econometric modeling for a quantitative interpre-tation of consumer reviews on the Internet. Our results can be used by manufacturers to determine which features con-tribute most to the demand for their product. Such informa-tion can also help manufacturers facilitate changes in prod-uct design over the course of a product X  X  life cycle as well as help retailers decide on which features to promote and highlight in advertisements and in-store displays. We believe that there is rich potential for future research. From the econometric point of view, future work can focus on pure price-hedonic regressions that highlight which fea-ture of the product, both implicit and explicit, constitutes what proportion of the product price. Such an analysis can enable consumers to figure out exactly how much they are paying for each product attribute within a class of products. It would also be interesting to examine how traditional he-donic studies can be enhanced when they incorporate quali-tative features, and not just directly measurable parameters. From the text mining point of view, advances in algorithms for product feature identification, and for extraction of the associated evaluation phrases, can definitely improve the re-sults of our technique. We plan to examine the limits of these improvements by analyzing manually product reviews and extracting the features that are discussed together with their evaluations. Another interesting direction that we plan to explore is the results of our technique when using higher rank approximations of the tensor space. Right now, our rank-1 approximation allows a single score for each evalua-tion and a single weight for a product feature. A natural extension is to examine how many different meanings we can allow for each phrase, without running into overfitting problems.

Overall, we believe that the interaction of economics re-search with data mining research can benefit tremendously both fields. Economic approaches can offer natural solutions to problems that seemed too hard to solve in a vacuum (e.g., determining the strength of an opinion). Similarly, data min-ing approaches can improve the current state of the art in empirical economics, where the focus has traditionally been on relatively smaller data sets.
