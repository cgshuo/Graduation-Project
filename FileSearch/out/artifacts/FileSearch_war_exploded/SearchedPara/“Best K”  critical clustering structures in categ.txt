 Keke Chen  X  Ling Liu Abstract The demand on cluster analysis for categorical data continues to grow over the last decade. A well-known problem in categorical clustering is to determine the best K number of clusters. Although several categorical clustering algorithms have been developed, surprisingly,nonehassatisfactorilyaddressedtheproblemofbestKforcategoricalclustering. Since categorical data does not have an inherent distance function as the similarity measure, traditional cluster validation techniques based on geometric shapes and density distributions are not appropriate for categorical data. In this paper, we study the entropy property between the clustering results of categorical data with different K number of clusters, and propose the BKPlot method to address the three important cluster validation problems: (1) How can we determine whether there is significant clustering structure in a categorical dataset? (2) If there is significant clustering structure, what is the set of candidate  X  X est Ks X ? (3) If the dataset is large, how can we efficiently and reliably determine the best Ks? Keywords Categorical data clustering  X  Entropy  X  Cluster validation 1 Introduction Data clustering is well-known as an important tool in data analysis, where a clustering algorithm uses some similarity measure to group the most similar items into clusters [ 28 ]. Clustering techniques for categorical data are very different from those for numerical data in terms of the definition of similarity measure. Traditionally, categorical data clustering is merged into numerical clustering through a data preprocessing stage [ 28 ]. In the preproces-sing, numerical features are extracted/constructed from the categorical data, or a conceptual similarity function between data records is defined based on the domain knowledge.
However, meaningful numerical features or conceptual similarity are usually difficult to extract at the early stage of data analysis, because we have little knowledge about the data. It has been widely recognized that directly clustering the raw categorical data is important for many applications. Examples include environmental data analysis [ 35 ], market basket 21 , 23 , 26 , 30 , 36 ].

Cluster validation for categorical data Different clustering algorithms hardly generate the same clustering result for the same dataset, and we need cluster validation methods to cluster validation: (1) how to evaluate the quality of different partition schemes generated by different clustering algorithms for the same dataset, with a fixed K number of clusters; (2) how to determine whether there is significant clustering structure in the datasets; (3) how to determine the best number of clusters (the  X  X est K X ), if there is inherent significant clustering structure in the dataset.

In addition, when large datasets are processed for clustering, the performance becomes critical to effective to both clustering and cluster validation. General approaches addressing the performance issue, such as sampling, raise particular problems for validating clusters in large datasets: (1) whether the result on sample datasets is consistent with that on the original dataset, and (2) how to estimate the proper sample size that guarantees the consistency.
For numerical data, the clustering structure is usually validated by the geometry and density distribution of clusters. When a distance function is given for the numerical data, it is functions and density concepts play unique roles in validating the numerical clustering result. Various statistical cluster validation methods and visualization-based validation methods have been proposed for numerical data [ 13 , 24 , 27 ], all of which are based on the geometry and density property of datasets. The intuition behind the geometry and density distribution justifies the effectiveness of these cluster validation methods. A good example commonly seen in clustering literature is evaluating the clustering result of 2D experimental datasets by visualizing it X  X he clustering result is validated by checking how well the clustering result matches the geometry and density distribution of points through the cluster visualization.
Due to the lack of intuitive distance functions between categorical values, the techniques usedinclustervalidationfornumericaldataarenotapplicabletocategoricaldata.Withoutrea-sonable numerical feature extraction/construction for a given categorical dataset, the general distance functions are usually inapplicable. As a result, no geometry/density-based validation method is appropriate in validating the clustering result for categorical data. Surprisingly, to our knowledge, there is no literature satisfactorily addressing the cluster validation problems for categorical data.

Entropy based categorical clustering One way to address the similarity problem for categorical data is to use set-based similarity measures, for example, the entropy [ 17 ] based measures. Originated from information theory, entropy has been applied in both pattern discovery [ 10 ] and numerical clustering [ 16 ]. Recently, there have been some efforts in applying entropy and the related concepts in information theory to clustering categorical clustering categorical data.

Entropy-based similarity measures evaluate the orderliness of a given cluster. In entropy-based categorical clustering, the quality of clustering result is naturally evaluated by the entropy of all clusters [ 6 , 30 ], namely, the expected entropy (EE). The lower the EE is, the more ordered the clusters are. While it is intuitive to evaluate the overall orderliness of a clustering result with EE, can entropy also be used to identify the best K number of clusters? can it be used to determine whether there is significant clustering structure in a given dataset?
Our contributions We try to answer the above cluster validation problems based on the entropy difference between the optimal clustering structures. Intuitively, if the best clustering structure has K clusters, fitting the data from K clusters into K  X  1 clusters will seriously disturb the clustering structure, while the change of optimal K + 1clustersto K clusters should be much less distinctive. This heuristic leads us to explore the property of optimal neighboring clustering structures with K and K + 1 clusters, respectively, K varying from major clusters. 1 The optimality is evaluated based on EE. Briefly, we identify and interpret that the similarity between the optimal clustering structures is the key to find the critical clustering structures, and then propose the  X  Best-K Plot (BKPlot) X  method to conveniently capture the dramatic difference between the optimal clustering structures.

However, optimal BKPlots are based on optimal clustering results, which are compu-tationally intractable due to the NP-hard complexity of entropy minimization. Generating high-quality  X  X pproximate BKPlots X  becomes a significant problem in practice. We address this problem with two aspects. First, we propose a new inter-cluster similarity measure incre-mental entropy (IE) . With IE, a standard agglomerative categorical clustering algorithm with Entropy criterion (as  X  X CE X  X  algorithm referred in this paper) can be used for generating reliable approximate BKPlots. The initial experimental results show that an agglomerative algorithmbasedonIEcangeneratehigh-qualityBKPlots,comparedtootherentropy-criterion based algorithms. Second, for large datasets, we develop the theory of sample approximate BKPlot , which addresses the issues in consistently identifying the best Ks based on uniformly sampled datasets with the IE-based method.

When applying sample approximate BKPlot, we also notice that there are datasets having no significant clustering structure, such as uniformly distributed data, or single-mode clus-tering structure. By exploring the characteristics of the BKPlots for the typical no-cluster datasets, we provide a testing method for determining whether a given dataset has significant clustering structure.

In summary, we propose a framework for determining the critical clustering structure in categorical datasets, which consists of four main components 1. the basic BKPlot method for determining the best Ks; 2. the IE based inter-cluster similarity measure and the algorithm for generating reliable 3. the theory of sample approximate BKPlot for large datasets; 4. a testing method for determining whether there is significant clustering structure for a
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets down the basic concepts and notations. Section 3 introduces the BKPlot method for determining the best Ks and the intuition behind the method, as well as an effective method for generating approximate BKPlots X  X he ACE algorithm. In Sect. 4 and 5 , we analyze the sample approximate BKPlots for large datasets, and also propose a novel testing method for determining the existence of significant clustering structure. The experimental results are presented in Sect. 6 . Section 7 reviews some related work in categorical clustering and cluster validation, and finally we conclude the paper. 2 Basic notations and concepts We define the notations used in this paper and then introduce the entropy-based clustering criterion. Some basic properties about the entropy criterion will be presented in the later sections. 2.1 Basic entropy definition Consider that a dataset S with N records and d columns, is a sample set of the discrete random vector X = ( x 1 , x 2 ,..., x d ) . For each component x j ,1  X  j  X  d , x j takes a value from the domain A j .

There are a finite number of distinct categorical values in domain A j and we denote the we introduce the classical entropy definition [ 17 ].

Here, entropy H ( X ) is based on the column entropy H ( x j ) , while the correlations between estimated with the sample set S , we define the estimated entropy as H ( X | S ) . where p (v | S ) is the empirical probability estimated on S . To further simplify the notation, we also define the column entropy of A j as The estimated entropy on S is simply the sum of the column entropies.

Now we can define the concept of cluster entropy. Suppose the dataset S is partitioned into K clusters. Let C K ={ C 1 ,..., C K } represent the partition, where C k is a cluster and n k represent the number of records in C k . Thus, the cluster entropy of C k is the dataset entropy H ( X | C k ) . For simpler presentation, we use H ( S ) and H ( C k ) to represent the dataset entropy and cluster entropy, respectively.

The classical entropy-based clustering criterion tries to find the optimal partition, C K , which maximizes the following entropy criterion [ 9 , 11 , 30 ].

Since H ( S ) is fixed for the given dataset, maximizing Opt ( C K ) is equivalent to minimi-zing the item 1 n K k = 1 n k H ( C k ) , which is named as the expected entropy of partition C K . as the weighted entropy of cluster C k .

Li et al. [ 30 ] showed that the minimization of expected-entropy can be unified into proba-bilistic clustering framework, and closely related to many important concepts in information theory, clustering and classification, such as Kullback-Leibler Measure [ 17 ], Maximum Like-lihood [ 29 ], Minimum Description Length [ 17 ], and dissimilarity coefficients [ 7 ]. Entropy criterion is especially good for categorical clustering due to the lack of intuitive definition of distance for categorical values. While entropy criterion can also be applied to numerical data [ 16 ], it is not the best choice for capturing all of the geometric properties a numerical dataset may have. 2.2 Incremental entropy Individually, cluster entropy cannot determine the structural difference between clusters. However, we observe that the structural difference can be observed by mixing (merging) two clusters. By entropy definition, the structural characteristic of a dataset is determined by the value frequencies in each column. Intuitively, mixing two clusters that are similar in the inherent structure will not change the value frequencies, thus, not change the expected-entropy of the partition as well. However, merging dissimilar ones will inevitably change the value frequencies, increasing the expected-entropy. Therefore, the increase of EE in merging clusters has some correlation with the similarity between clusters.

By the definition of expected-entropy, after merging two clusters in a partition the dif-ference of expected-entropy can be equivalently evaluated by the difference between the following first result about weighted entropies.
 Proposition 2.1 ( n p + n q ) H ( C p  X  C q )  X  n p H ( C p ) + n q H ( C q ) Proofsketch. This proposition formally states that mixing two clusters will not reduce the weighted entropy. The first step of the proof is to expand both sides of the formula with the entropy definition. Let p ( x j = v | C p ) be the estimated probability of x j = v in the column A j within the cluster C p .
It is straightforward to prove that the above formula is true if the following relation is satisfied for each value v in each column A j . Namely, if we can prove that for each categorical value in each column the following formula is true, then the proposition is established.
Without loss of generality, suppose C p having x rows and C q having y rows with value v at j th attribute, x , y &gt; 0(if x = 0or y = 0, the inequality is trivially satisfied), i.e., p ( x j = v | C p ) = x n inequality 2 can be transformed to x log 2 x n exactly the  X  X og-sum inequality X  [ 17 ]. We define the key concept  X  Incremental Entropy (IE) X  based on the above proposition. Definition 2.1 Incremental Entropy reflects the structural difference between two clusters,
From the proof of Proposition 2.1 , it follows that if the two clusters have the identical p not concern the size of the clusters. Thus, it intuitively implies that sampling will be effective when IE is used as a clustering criterion, which we will use to derive another important result later.

Incremental entropy is a critical measure in our method. We will use this similarity mea-sure to construct a hierarchical clustering algorithm in order to generate reliable results for approximately determining the best Ks. The relationship between cluster merging and simi-larity can also help us understand the method to find the best Ks in next section.
For clear presentation, we summarize the notations we will use in Table 1 . 3 Finding the best K with entropy criterion Traditionally, the Best Ks for numerical data clustering are identified with statistical index curves, based on geometry and density properties of the dataset [ 24 , 32 ] or likelihood [ 25 ]. Depending on the different property of the index curve, the K s at peaks, valleys, or distin-guished  X  X nees X  on the curve, may be regarded as the candidates of the optimal number of clusters (the best Ks). Are there entropy-based such curves indicating the significant cluste-ring structures for categorical data?
The first thought might be investigating the curve of EE for the optimal partitions. We define Definition 3.1 An optimal partition of K clusters is a partition that results in the minimum EE among all K-cluster partitions.
 curve is often a smoothly decreasing curve without distinguished peaks, valley, or knees (Fig. 1 ). However, we can actually obtain some information between the neighboring optimal partitions (with K and K + 1 clusters respectively) with the concept of entropy difference. Concretely, the difference of neighboring expected-entropies (Fig. 2 ) can be used to indicate the critical clustering structures. This relationship can be intuitively illustrated and understood by merging similar clusters in an optimal partition. The entropy-difference curve often shows that the similar partitions with different K are at the same  X  X lateau X . From plateau to plateau there are the critical points implying the significant change of clustering structure, which can be the candidates of the best Ks. Before going to details, we first give some entropy properties of optimal partitions. 3.1 Entropy properties of optimal partitions Given the number of clusters, K , there is at least one optimal partition with minimum EE  X  H opt ( C K ) . There are several properties about is reached at k = N , when each record is a cluster. Therefore,  X  H opt ( C K ) is bounded by [ 0 , H ( S ) ] .

We can also derive the relationship between the optimal partitions with any different number of clusters, K and L , K &lt; L , with the help of Proposition 2.1 .
 Proposition 3.1  X  H opt ( C K )  X   X  H opt ( C L ) ,whenK &lt; L Proofsketch. Let a L -cluster partition C L K -cluster partition. With Proposition 2.1 and the definition of optimal partition, we have Proposition 3.1 shows that the optimal expected-entropy decreases with the increasing of K , which meets the intuition well. However, it is hard to describe the curve with a function of closed form in terms of K . As our experimental result shows, it is often a negative logarithm-like curve (Fig. 1 ). This curve implies that, (1) it is highly possible that the best K is not unique in terms of entropy criterion, and (2) with only expected-entropy curve, we cannot clearly identify the significant clustering structures. 3.2 Understanding the similarity of neighboring partitions In this section, we focus on the similarity between the neighboring optimal partitions. We formally define this similarity with the entropy difference between the neighboring partitions as There are two heuristics to capture this similarity. One aspect is the absolute value of I ( K ) , which indicates how much the clustering structure is changed. The other aspect is the dif-ference between I ( K ) and I ( K + 1 ) , which indicates whether the consecutive changes to the clustering structure are similar. Since it is not easy to understand the change between the optimal partitions, we use a cluster merging scheme, which will be described in Sect. 3.3 ,to demonstrate the two aspects of similarity.  X  First, small I ( K ) means high similarity between the neighboring partitions. We can  X  For large change of EE, we first consider the meaning of large I ( K ) . If the expected-
An example of  X  X imilar merges X  in Fig. 3 can well demonstrate similar changes versus significant changes of clustering structure. We use icons to conceptually represent catego-rical clusters. The shape and the size of an icon represent the structure and the size of the cluster, respectively. Suppose that the initial state with C 1 X  C 5 are the optimal partition of K +2 clusters, among which C1, C2, and C3 are in a similar clustering structure as shown in Fig. 4 . Now, we try to form sub-optimal partitions by merging the similar clusters. As Proposition 2.1 shows, merging the clusters with similar clustering structure will result in small IE , which means small entropy difference between the two neighboring partitions. Suppose that, H ( C K + 1 ) is approximately minimized by merging C1 and C2, and H ( C K ) by merging C1+C2 and C3. Since the three clusters are in a similar structure, the consecutive should not be distinguishable from each other. On the other hand, reducing the number of clusters further from K to K  X  1 will change the clustering structure a lot and inevitably bring more impurity into the partitions. As a result, I ( K  X  1 ) will be much larger than I ( K ) and I (
K + 1 ) . We can see that K becomes a significant point where a series of similar clustering structures are changed to a significantly different clustering structure. Therefore, the  X  X nees X  on the I ( K ) curve can provide substantial information about similar changes or significant changes of clustering structure.

In practice, if a dataset has significant clustering structure, we can find a series of neighbo-ring  X  X table X  schemes, which result in similar I ( K ) , and we may also find the critical points where a series of  X  X table X  schemes become  X  X ess stable X  when K is reduced (Fig. 2 ). All of the critical points should be the candidates of the best Ks and could be interesting to cluster analysis.

The common way to mathematically identify such critical knees on the I ( K ) curve is to find the peaks/valleys of the second-order difference of the curve. Specifically, since I ( K ) curve consists of a set of discrete points, we define the second-order difference of the curve as and  X  I ( K ) = I ( K )  X  I ( K + 1 ) to make K aligned with the critical points. For convenience, we name the B curve as the  X  X est-k Plot (BKPlot) X  (Fig. 4 )and B ( K ) indicates the value of B function at K . Notice that dramatic structure changes happen only at I ( K )&gt; I ( K + 1 ) . I (
K )&lt; I ( K + 1 ) means the structure change is slowing down when the number of clusters is reduced from K + 1to K . In this case, we should continue to look at the range 2  X  k &lt; K to find other dramatic changes. 2 Therefore, we need only to look at the peaks of BKPlot to find the best Ks. 3.3 Generating high-quality approximate BKPlot From the definition of BKPlot, we know it is intractable to generate the exact BKPlot since obtaining the optimal clustering result is computationally intractable for even a small dataset. However, it is important to note that the use of BKPlots is to find the best Ks, and  X  X pproximate BKPLots X  may be used to correctly identify the Best Ks as well. We consider high quality BKPlots as the approximate BKPlots that can consistently and correctly identify the candidate best Ks.

Although there are many clustering algorithms proposed so far, none have designed with the above objectives in mind. Hence, we develop a method for generating high-quality approximate BKPlots. Since it is a standard Agglomerative Categorical clustering algorithm with Entropy criterion, we call it ACE for short.

ACE is based on the proposed inter-cluster similarity measure: the IE. While the traditional hierarchical algorithms for numerical clustering need to explicitly define the inter-cluster similarity with  X  X ingle-link X ,  X  X ulti-link X  or  X  X omplete-link X  methods [ 27 ], IE is a natural cluster-based similarity measure, ready for constructing a hierarchical clustering algorithm.
As a standard hierarchical algorithm, ACE algorithm is a bottom-up process to construct a clustering tree. It begins with the scenario where each record is a cluster. Then, an iterative process is followed  X  in each step, the algorithm finds a pair of clusters C p and C q that are the most similar, i.e. the IE IE ( C p , C q ) is minimum among all pairs of clusters.
Since IE calculation involves the expensive entropy calculation, a working algorithm has to optimize the entropy calculation. ACE uses three structure to maintain the incremental calculation of IE values: summary table for convenient counting of occurrences of values, IE-table for bookkeeping IE ( C p , C q ) of any pair of clusters C p and C q ,anda IE heap for maintaining the minimum IE value in each merge. With the help of these data structures, we can optimize the IE based ACE algorithm (with complexity of O ( N 2 log N ) ). We will simply skip the detailed algorithm here, but refer interested readers to the paper [ 14 ]. Experimental results show that ACE algorithm is the most effective algorithm for generating high-quality approximate BKPlots, compared to other existing algorithms similarly optimizing entropy criterion, such as Monte-Carlo [ 30 ], Coolcat [ 6 ], and LIMBO [ 3 ].

More importantly, the ACE algorithm has a nice property in generating sample BKPlots for handling large datasets X  X he mean of sample BKPlots generated by ACE algorithm on sample datasets is essentially an unbiased estimator of the original BKPlot generated by ACE for the entire dataset. This property is important since we often need to handle large datasets that cannot be directly processed by the ACE algorithm. 4 Sample BKPlots for large datasets When the dataset is large (e.g., the number of records N &gt; 10 , 000 ), ACE algorithm is not effective due to its complexity O ( N 2 log N ) . There are two commonly accepted approaches to handling large datasets: one is sampling and the other is summarization. We will focus on the uniform sampling approach for finding the best Ks for large datasets in this paper, while the summarization approach has been reported for processing data streams [ 15 ].
Why uniform sampling is also appropriate for BKPlots? The reason is that BKPlot is only used to identify the major change of clustering structure, which consists of large clusters in comparable size. 3 Thus, while uniform sampling is applied with an appropriate sample size, we can assume such clustering structures are well preserved. In the sampling approach, we identify the best Ks based on the BKPlots generated on sample datasets, which we name it sample BKPlots , denoted by B ( n , K ) at sample size n and the number of clusters K .Wealso name the BKPlot on the original dataset original BKPlot .Let s denote the number of sample BKPlots and i denote the sample BKPlot based on the sample dataset i .Wedefinethe mean BKPlot of s sample BKPlots as follows.
 Other new notations are summarized in Table 2 . In order to prove that sample BKPlots based on uniform sampling can work effectively for large datasets, we need to answer three questions: (1) Do the mean BKPlots converge to the original BKPlot? (2)How is the quality of mean BKPlots in terms of consistency to the original BKPlot? (3) How to estimate the appropriate sample size that guarantees the mean BKPlot is consistent with the original BKPlot? The following sections will be focused on these three questions.

If mean BKPlots converge to the original BKPlot, we can confidently use mean BKPlots to estimate the original BKPlot. The quality of mean BKPlots should be related to the sample size and possibly other factors. We below first discuss the convergence of mean BKPlots which is used to evaluate the consistency of the mean BKPlots. Then we study the variance of mean BKPlots to evaluate the quality of the BKPlot estimation, and finally we develop the method for verifying whether a given sample size can guarantee a reliable mean BKPlot or not. 4.1 Convergence of mean BKPlots In general, we model the major clustering structure of a very large dataset S as follows. Let the primaryclusteringstructurecontainsafew large clusters,denotedas C M ={ C 1 , C 2 ,..., C M } , e.g., M = 10, which are preserved under uniform sampling, with n records. Thus, we can assume the M clusters are proportionally sampled to generate the sample dataset. We denote we have the following proposition.
 Proposition 4.1 If the primary clustering structure is preserved with sample size n, the sample cluster entropy  X  H ( C n , i ) converges to H ( C i ) ,whenn  X  N This proposition states that with the increasing sample size, the structure of sample cluster become more and more similar to that of original cluster. This can be easily proved based on the definition of subset entropy (please refer to Appendix for details).

Our ultimate goal is to study the mean and variance of B ( n , K ) , which are related to the entropy difference between the sample clustering structures, denoted as I ( n , K ) ,where n is the sample size and K is the number of cluster. Let a point on a sample BKPlot be B ( n , K ) . We show that we can use a set of sample BKPlots to estimate the original BKPlot for the entire large dataset as the following theorem states.
 Theorem 1 The original BKPlot generated by the ACE algorithm for the large dataset can be estimated with the mean of sample BKPlots that are also generated by ACE.
 Proofsketch. The proof consists of two steps. 1) E [ I ( n , K ) ] converges to the approximate I ( K ) generated by the ACE algorithm. When
How reliable E [ B ( n , K ) ] can be used to represent the original BKPlot depends on its variance. Before we design the method to check the reliability of a mean BKPlot, we first study the variance of mean BKPlots. 4.2 Variance of mean BKPlots estimation. We are more interested in the asymptotic variance, especially the relationship between variance and sample size. We will study the asymptotic variance of E [ B ( n , K ) ] in four steps. (1) We derive the general form of asymptotic variance of the sum of random variables: Var ( m i = 1 a i X i ) , which will be heavily used in deriving other results; Then, we show that (2) Var ( E [  X  H ( C n , i ) ] )  X  O ( 1 n have Please refer to the Appendix for the details in the four steps. With the final result X  X he step 4, it is intuitive that, by increasing the sample size, n , or the number of sample sets, s ,the mean BKPlot should become more and more reliable. 4.3 Conditions for reliable mean BKPlot In general, the larger n and s are, the smaller the variance of mean BKPlots is, which results in more reliable estimation. However, in practice, we want to use limited sample size ( n )and limited number of sample BKPlots ( s ) to get a reliable mean BKPlot that is consistent with the original BKPlot. In last section, we have found the relationship between the variance and these factors, with which we are able to verify whether a given set of sample datasets can generate a reliable mean BKPlot and how we can improve the reliability.

We first define the concept of  X  X onsistent mean BKPlot X . Suppose that the top  X  number of candidate Ks (e.g.,  X  = 3and K &lt; 20) on the original BKPlot have B ( K ) values be the significant Ks on the original BKPlot ordered by B ( k i ) ,1  X  i  X   X  .
 Definition 4.1 If the sequence of significant Ks on the mean BKPlot k 1 &lt; k 2 &lt;  X  X  X  &lt; k  X  satisfies k i = k i for 1  X  i  X   X  , the mean BKPlot is consistent with the original BKPlot. There are  X  + 1 significant levels on the original BKPlot: B ( k i ) ,1  X  i  X   X  ,and  X  .Letthe minimum difference between the  X  + 1valuesbe determined by certain B ( k r ) and B ( k q ) , r [ 29 ], for example, c = 1 . 96 for CL = 95% confidence level for normal distribution. Since E [
B ( n , K ) ] follows a normal distribution with mean B ( K ) and variance Var ( B ( n , K ))/ s for large n , we can estimate whether the order will be preserved for certain sample size. Concretely, in order to make the  X  levels consistent with the original BKPlot, we should guarantee the non-overlapping confidence intervals of B ( n , k i ) at the significant Ks, with confidence CL , i.e., the following constraint is satisfied. It follows that, if the sample variance at size n satisfies the following formula, the mean BKPlot will be consistent with the original BKPlot.
 This describes the reliability of the mean BKPlot in term of sample size n , the number of sample BKPlots s , and the interested top Ks. Note that we really do not know the exact value. We can only bootstrap with some initial n and s for the given dataset, e.g., n = 1 , 000 and S = 10. Then, we get the estimation of Var ( B ( n , K )) and from the sample BKPlots. If the Formula ( 4 ) is satisfied with the estimated Var ( B ( n , K )) and , the mean of sample BKPlots is reliable under certain confidence level CL . Otherwise, we should increase either n ,or s , and apparently, increasing s is more economic. 5 Identifying no-cluster datasets with BKPlot method Finding the peaks on BKPlot does not always mean the existence of significant clustering structure. Low peak levels mean smooth changes of clustering structure and each clustering structuredoesnotdistinguishitselffromothers,i.e.,thereisnosignificantclusteringstructure. Therefore, a challenge comes X  X ow to distinguish datasets having clustering structures from those having no clustering structure? We propose a method to address this problem. The main idea is based on the property of the sample BKPlots for the datasets that are known to have no clustering structure. Specifically, first, we study the characteristics of clustering structure for the typical no-cluster datasets: datasets with uniform or normal data distribution (single cluster mode). Then, we test if the clustering structure of the given dataset is significantly different from the no-cluster structures. 5.1 Property of datasets having no clustering structure We study two types of typical datasets that do not have significant clustering structure. One is the datasets with elements uniformly distributed in a column and between columns, which obviously have no clustering structure. The other type is the datasets of discretized multidimensional normal distribution, which has only one mode (or one cluster). In the following discussion, the maximum peak level (MPL) of BKPlot is used to represent the significance level of the clustering structure.

Ideally, large sample datasets exactly following uniform/normal distribution have no signi-ficant clustering structure. Thus, every point on their BKPlots should be very close to zero, with tiny variance for large sample datasets. However, synthetic sample datasets usually do not exactly follow the desired distribution, which may create some small noisy structures. These noisy structures should be treated as statistically equivalent to the ideal no-cluster structures. Therefore, we can also treat any datasets that have clustering structures not signi-ficantly different from these noisy structures as the no-cluster datasets. With the varying number of records n , columns d , and column cardinalities | A j | ,1  X  j  X  d , synthetic sample datasets may deviate from the desired distribution to different extent, with different levels of noisy structures. We will characterize them both formally and experimentally.

In deriving Formula ( 3 ), the asymptotic form of the variance of mean BKPlots, we also (see Appendix).
 f everywhere. Thus, with the increasing n or d , the MPLs should converge to 0. The conver-ging rate is characterized by the corresponding factors in Var ( E [ B ( n , K ) ] ) . From above formula we are unable to directly determine the effect of | A j | . However, we will show some experimental results to further study the relationship between the three factors and MPLs. 5.2 Testing existence of significant clustering structure From the above analysis, we conclude that different settings of n , d and | A | may result in differentstatisticalpropertiesofno-clusterBKPlots.Thereisnosimplethresholdindependent of the settings. Thus, given a real dataset, its sample BKPlots have to be compared to those of no-cluster datasets that have the same setting of n , d ,and | A j | .

Combined with the theory of sample BKPlots, we suggest the following testing method for determining the significance of the clustering structure in a given dataset. 1. Generate the BKPlot with ACE algorithm for the target dataset and find its MPL, denoted 3. calculate the mean denoted by  X  , and the confidence interval of the MPLs of the simulated 4. if  X  &gt; X  + CI, there is significant clustering structure in the target dataset, otherwise, 6 Experiments We have formally given the basic BKPlot method, the sample BKPlot method for large datasets, and the BKPlot method for identifying no-cluster datasets. In this section, we want to show that, (1) BKPlots can be used to effectively find the critical K s; (2) experimental results support the initial analysis of the noisy structures of typical no-cluster datasets; (3) ACE algorithm is a robust tool for generating high-quality approximate BKPlots, compared to the existing entropy-based clustering algorithms, such as Monte-Carlo method (MC) [ 30 ], Coolcat [ 6 ], and LIMBO [ 3 ]. 6.1 Datasets In order to intuitively evaluate the effectiveness of the method, we use both synthetic and real datasets, and cross-validate the results with the visualization tool VISTA [ 13 ]thatis designed for validating numerical clustering results.

Simple synthetic data (DS1&amp;DS2). First, we construct two sets of synthetic categorical datasets, so that their clustering structure can be intuitively understood and verified. The first set of datasets has totally separated clusters in one layer Fig. 5 . The second set has a multi-layered clustering structure with overlapping clusters in the lower layer (the layer with more clusters). Both can be visually verified. Figure 6 shows such a dataset with 1,000 records and 30 columns. It has a two-layered clustering structure. The top layer has four clusters, two of which also have two sub-clusters, respectively (Fig. 7 ). Each cluster has random categorical values selected from { X 0 X ,  X 1 X ,  X 2 X ,  X 3 X ,  X 4 X ,  X 5 X  X  in a distinct set of attributes, while the rest attributes are set to  X 0 X . As we can visually identify it, its BKPlot should at least suggest two best Ks. We name these two types of datasets as DS1 and DS2, respectively.

Discretized synthetic mixture data (DMIX). The third set of datasets, are the discreti-zed version of multidimensional normal mixture datasets [ 25 ]. We use this set of datasets because we can validate the result with both BKPlot method and the visualization method. As we discretize the continuous value while still preserving the numerical meaning, the original numerical clusters are preserved. Meanwhile, similar values are categorized to the same categorical values, which makes the categorical clustering structure consistent with the numerical clustering structure. We then use a visualization approach, VISTA, which is designed for interactively validating the clustering structure for numerical data [ 13 ], to visually validate the clusters. By doing so, we are able to better understand the nature of our proposed categorical method. A discretized 10-dimensional mixture dataset with 7 clusters (10,000 samples) is visualized in Fig. 8 . The continuous values in each column are parti-tioned into 10 equal-width buckets for discretization. These 7 clusters also show a hidden two-layer clustering structure (C1.1, C1.2, C1.3), (C2.1, C2.2), (C3) and (C4). In particular, C2.1 and C2.2 are overlapped by each other, and C1 clusters are very close to each other, which generate some special difficulty for identifying them.
 Census data. We use a real dataset X  X he discretized version of the large 1990 census data. 5 This dataset is originally used by the paper [ 31 ] in studying the relationship between the sampling approach and the effectiveness of Expectation-Maximization (EM) based clustering algorithms for very large datasets. It is large in terms of both the number of records and the number of attributes. After dropping many of the less useful attributes in the raw dataset, the total number of preserved attributes still reaches 68. It contains more than 2 million (2,458,284) records, about 352 megabytes in total. Since the discretized version still preserves the ordinal meaning, we can similarly use the visualization method to evaluate whether the BKPlot method is effective, as we do for DMIX data. C2.1 and C2.2 in Census Data are also a pair of overlapping clusters.
Overlapping clusters are clusters that are similar to each other but each of the clusters still has its own characteristic distribution to distinguish itself from other clusters. Identifying and handling overlapping clusters is a difficult problem in numerical data clustering, and it is more difficult for categorical data. Overlapping clusters in categorical data can be exemplified with these subclusters in DS2, the C2.1 and C2.2 in DMIX, and also the C2.1 and C2.2 in Census. In many cases, if there are a multi-layered clustering structure, it is possible that overlapping clusters present. Identifying them is useful since deep analysis of these clusters may reveal particular characteristics in practice. Due to the unclear boundary between the overlapping clusters, most methods may fail to identify them. However, we will see that BKPlots can be used to effectively identify them. Further analysis on the grouped clusters identified by the BKPlot method, such as comparing the IE between each pair of clusters in the group, can reveal more details of the overlapping clusters. 6.2 Validating the BKPlot method Below we show the result of applying the BKPlot Method to the synthetic and real datasets. ACE algorithm is used to generate the BKPlots. We generate ten sample datasets for each type of synthetic clustering structure.
 DS1. The BKPlots generated by ACE algorithm for DS1-i datasets (Fig. 9 clearly indicate that  X 3 X  is the only significant K and datasets with the same clustering structure have almost the identical BKPlot. By checking the significant level for the setting of 1,000 records, 30 columns and column cardinality of 6, with 20 no-cluster test datasets (10 normal distribution datasets and 10 uniform distribution datasets, respectively), we find the MPLs of no-cluster datasets are around 0.0004, which is far lower than that of the DS1, 0.21. Therefore, the detected best K is significant.
 DS2. The peaks of BKPlots for DS2-i (Fig. 10 ) include the two inherent significant K s X  X 4 X  and  X 6 X . However,  X 2 X  is also given as the third significant K , which suggests that the top 4 clusters can be further clustered into two groups. Interestingly, compared to the three peak levels, we notice that the peak values at  X  K = 2 X  have much higher variance, which implies that  X  K = 2 X  is less significant than the other two.
 DMIX. The BKPlot of DMIX generated by ACE algorithm (Fig. 11 ) indicates that 7 and 4 are the best Ks with a noisy best K at 2, and they are significant compared to the bound (  X  0.0013) for the setting of 1,000 records, 10 columns and column cardinality of 10. The 4-cluster structure indicates that some of the 7 clusters are close to each other and form a secondary clustering structure. The corresponding labeled result shows the clustering/validation result is well matched with the visualization result (Fig. 8 ).
 Census data. The Census data contains three major clusters as shown in the visualization of 1K sample dataset (Fig. 12 . In the sample data, C2 and C3 are very close, thus, they may also form a two-layer clustering structure X  X he top layer consists of C1 and C2+C3. Its BKPlot (Fig. 13 indicates both 2 and 3 are significant, compared to the bound (  X  0.0005) for the setting (1,000 records, 68 columns and column cardinality defined in [ 31 ]). The clustering result with ACE at K = 3 is very close to the cluster distribution observed via visualization (Fig. 12 ). The cross-validation with the visualization method confirms that the best K and clustering result generated by ACE algorithm are highly consistent with the inherent clustering structure.
We summarize the detailed information in Table 3 . n represents the sample size used in generating BKPlots, d is the number of columns, and  X  X ardinality X  is the column cardi-nality, i.e., | A | . For the first three datasets, each column has the same cardinality. For the census dataset, the column cardinality varies from 2 to 223. Clustering structure describes the possible hierarchical structure of dataset. For example,  X  X wo layers, 4/6 clusters X  for DS2 means that the clustering structure has two layers with 4 and 6 clusters, respectively.  X  X PL bounds X  is the estimated upper bound of no-cluster datasets with the same setting of n , d and |
A | . Due to very small confidence intervals, only the mean levels are used to represent the bounds.  X  X estK X  are the best Ks suggested by ACE algorithm and  X  X PLs at Best Ks X  are the corresponding MPLs in the BKPlots generated by ACE algorithm. 6.3 Comparing BKPlot and BIC Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [ 25 ] is a popular method for model selection. If appro-priate assumption is made about the prior distribution of the clusters, it can also be used to select the best K number of clusters. We compare our method with BIC and show the unique advantages of our method.
 In order to use BIC method, we need to make assumption about the cluster distribution. Categorical data is often modeled with Multinomial mixture [ 29 ]. The model fitting is opti-mized by maximizing the likelihood of fitting the data to the mixture model. The generic form of BIC is then based on the maximum likelihood and the number of parameters used in estimation.
 where n is the number of sample records, and  X  is the number of parameters used in the modeling that include the number of clusters. Usually, the K corresponding to the minimum BIC is regarded as the best K. The main problem is, if the real cluster distribution does not well follow the assumed distribution with any K, the result is possibly not good. For instance, in numerical clustering, the Gaussian mixture model assumption does not work well for irregularly shaped clusters and thus BIC based on the Gaussian assumption is not effective.

In experiments, we use AutoClass 6 to generate the fitted model, which will also give BIC values. In AutoClass,  X  is specifically defined as d ( d + 1 ) + K ,where d is the number of columns. On the BIC curve, the best K happens at the minimum BIC. It shows that the BIC method can often suggest one best K (Fig. 14 ), but it cannot find all possible best Ks for multi-layer clustering structures. In the experiment we also observed, the best K for DMIX and Census data is not clearly indicated (Figs. 15 , 16 ), possibly because of the overlapping clusters, the complex clustering structure, and the outliers. 6.4 Properties of sample BKPlots for large datasets Now we study some properties of sample BKPlots, and particularly mean BKPlots. The mean BKPlot has two important factors: the number s of sample sets and the sample size n for each sample set. We will focus on the size n in the experiment. We use both DMIX and Census data. For each tested sample size, we generate 10 sample BKPlots, on which the mean BKPlot is calculated. Figure 17 for Census data shows, when the clustering structure is simple, the resulting mean BKPlots are very close for different sample sizes, even though the sample size is small. Figure 18 zooms in the peak values at K = 3atFig. 17 . It shows that with the increase of sample size, the MPLs will be stablized at certain level as we expected.
Figure 19 shows that the sample variance decreases with the increasing sample size as we have formally analyzed. For the same sample size, a smaller K also implies merging larger clusters, which usually means a larger n p + n q . Since Formula ( 8 ) in Appendix shows that v will result in larger variance.

However, sample size does affect the accuracy of BKPlots for complicated clustering structure.DMIXhasmoreclustersandtheclusteringstructureisalsomuchmorecomplicated. InFig. 20 ,weseewhenthesamplesizeisverysmall,e.g.,200samples,theclusteringstructure is not preserved well. The mean BKPlot shows that the low-layer best clustering structure consists of eight clusters different from the expected seven clusters. On the contrast, the four-cluster clustering structure is more stable since it consists of larger number of points. In general, if a cluster is not compact in terms of intra-cluster similarity between points, or small in terms of number of records in the cluster, we will need more samples to preserve it. 6.5 Datasets having no clustering structure In this set of experiments, we want to show the relationship between the MPLs of no-cluster sample datasets and the factors: the number of records n , the number of columns d ,andthe column cardinalities | A j | , which should be consistent with our formal analysis.
Since n and d have similar effect on the sample BKPlots according to the analysis, we organize them in the first set of experiments, while the second set of experiments focus on the unknown effect of column cardinality. Each point on the figures is the average of ten runs with the standard deviation as the error bar. Number of records and number of columns For simplicity, the set of simulated datasets in this experiment have the equal cardinality for columns, denoted as | A |  X  X ith unequal cardinality, we can get similar results. Figure 21 shows the result when we fix the number of columns and the column cardinality, and vary the number of records only. The MPL drops quickly from the sample size 100 to 300, but keeps stable when the size increases more. This confirms our analysis that for small datasets, the entropy differences between the clusters have large variance and MPLs tend to deviate more from zero. Varying the number of columns, while fixing the other two factors, we get a similar pattern, as Fig. 22 shows.
 Column cardinality We can try to understand the factor of cardinality in terms of the model complexity X  X olumn cardinality represents the inherent complexity of dataset. In general, with the increasing model complexity, the representative sample size should be increased in order to capture the complexity of the structure. On the other hand, if the sample size n keeps unchanged the increasing model complexity should bring more variance, which results in stronger noisy structures, i.e., higher MPLs. This hypothesis is supported by the experiments (Fig. 23 ) that increasing the mean column cardinality will increase the level of MPLs with the same sample size. Figure 24 also shows that with the increasing sample size, the higher the column cardinality is, the slower the MPLs converge for both types of datasets (uniform and normal), which confirms that we need more samples to characterize the increasing model complexity. In Fig. 25 , we let the column cardinalities randomly varying pattern that the MPLs increase when the mean cardinality increases. 6.6 Comparing algorithms for generating approximate BKPlots Literally, any categorical clustering algorithm that employs the same entropy minimization criterion can generate approximate BKPlots. However, the quality of approximate BKPlots can be greatly influenced by the algorithms. We compare four directly related algorithms: our proposed ACE, Monte-Carlo [ 30 ], Coolcat [ 6 ], and LIMBO [ 3 ] in this section, to see whether ACE is the best for generating high-quality approximate BKPlots. Monte-Carlo and Coolcat use the same criterion,  X  X xpected-entropy X  that is also used by ACE, to find suboptimal partitions, while LIMBO uses mutual information in clustering, which is closely related expected-entropy. The reported results are based on ten randomly sampled datasets of each experimental data. 6.6.1 Algorithms for generating approximate BKPlots Monte-Carlo method [ 30 ] is a top-down partitioning algorithm. With a fixed K ,itbegins with all records in one cluster and follows an iterative process. In each step, the algorithm randomly picks one record from one of the K clusters and puts it into another randomly selected cluster. If the change of assignment does not reduce the EE, the record is put back to the original cluster. Theoretically, given a sufficiently large s , the algorithm will eventually terminate at a near optimal solution. We set s = 5 , 000 for running MC on the synthetic datasets.

Coolcat [ 6 ] algorithm begins with selecting K records, which maximize the K -record entropy, from a sample of the dataset as the initial K clusters. It sequentially processes the rest records and assigns each to one of the K cluster. In each step, the algorithm finds the best fitted one of the K clusters for the new record X  X dding the new record to the cluster will result in minimum increase of EE. The data records are processed in batches. Because the order of processing points has a significant impact on the quality of final clusters, there is a  X  X e-clustering X  procedure at the end of each batch. This procedure picks m percentage of the worst fitted records in the batch and re-assigns them to the K clusters in order to reduce the EE further.

We run Coolcat algorithm on each dataset with a large initial sample size (50% of the dataset) for choosing the seed clusters and m = 20% for re-clustering, which is sufficient for improvement through re-clustering [ 6 ]. In order to reduce the effect of ordering, we also run Coolcat 20 times for each datasets and each run processes the data in a randomly generated sequence. Finally, we select the best result X  X aving the lowest EE among the 20 results.
LIMBO [ 3 ] algorithm is a hierarchical clustering algorithm using the Information Bot-tleneck [ 33 ] criterion as the similarity between clusters. It uses a summarization structure DCF-tree to condense large datasets. In our experiments, we set the information loss factor to 0, which does not use DCF-tree to compress the data. Under this setting the result is not subject to the order of records, and thus there is no randomness introduced in different runs for the same dataset. 6.6.2 Measuring quality of BKPlots We use three measures to evaluate the quality of approximate BKPlots.  X  Coverage rate. TherobustnessofBKPlotisrepresentedwith X  X overageRate(CR) X  X  X ow  X  False discovery rate. There could be some K s, which are actually not critical but suggested  X  Expected entropy. Since the BKPlot is indirectly related to EE, it might also be reasonable 6.6.3 Results by other algorithms As we have shown in Sect. 6.2 , the BKPlots generated by ACE algorithm clearly and consis-tently indicate the exact Best Ks for the experimental datasets. We show some results gene-rated by other algorithms.

The BKPlots generated by Monte-Carlo algorithm for DS1 (Fig. 26 ) clearly identify that  X 3 X  is the best K with some small variation. However, BKPlots for DS2 show large variation on K s. Overall, the K s distribute from  X 2 X  to  X 10 X  for different DS2-i , not allowing the user to identify the exact best Ks (Fig. 27 ). This implies that MC algorithm might not be robust enough for datasets having complicated clustering structure. The reason is MC algorithm becomes more likely to trap in local minima with the increasing complexity of clustering structure and increasing number of clusters.

Coolcat algorithm is even worse. It brings large variance for both datasets (Figs. 28 and 29 ). The reason is that Coolcat algorithm simply does not guarantee to have near-optimal clustering results for any fixed number of clusters, and the results between different Ks do not necessarily correlate to each other.
 LIMBO can successfully find the best Ks for simple structures, such as DS1 and DS2. Its DS1 and DS2 BKPlots are very similar to ACE X  X . However, it may generate some noise and miss some best Ks for a more complicated structure, such as Census data and DMIX data. Interestingly, it is more easily confused by higher-level structures (with less number of clusters). For example, for DMIX data (Fig. 30 ), the LIMBO result can consistently give the bestKat K = 7, while it generates noisy results at K = 2 X 4.

We summarize the results with the discussed measures, CR, FDR, and EE in Table 4 .The higher the coverage rate, the more robust the BKPlot is. The lower the FDR the more efficient the BKPlot is. The numbers are the average over the ten sample datasets. In almost all cases, ACE shows the minimum EE and minimum standard deviation, as well as the highest CR and lowest FDR. LIMBO is the second reliable method for generating approximate BKPlots. In general, it can generate reliable BKPlots for not-so-noisy and non-overlapping clustering structure, but may miss a part of best clustering results for overlapping clusters, such as those in DMIX and Census data (Figs. 30 , 31 ). For those complicated clustering structures both MC and Coolcat will perform unsatisfactorily. These algorithms are not likely to keep the results consistently changing through all Ks. When they cannot find near-optimal results for complicated clustering structure, it is almost impossible to generate high-quality approximate BKPlots. 7 Related work While many numerical clustering algorithms [ 27 , 28 ] have been published, only a handful of categorical clustering algorithms appear in literature. The general statistical analysis of categorical data was introduced in [ 2 ]. Although it is unnatural to define a distance function between categorical data records or to use the statistical center (the mean) of a group of categorical items, there are some algorithms, for example, K-Modes [ 26 ] algorithm and ROCK [ 23 ] algorithm, trying to fit the traditional clustering methods into categorical data. However, since the numerical similarity/distance function may not describe the categorical properties properly, the result cannot be easily validated. Coolcat [ 6 ] has compared the EE method with ROCK and showed that expected-entropy is more appropriate for categorical data.
 CACTUS [ 20 ] adopts the linkage idea from ROCK and names it as  X  X trong connection X . The similarity is calculated by the  X  X upport X  X  X  threshold to connect or not. A cluster is defined as a region of attributes that are pair-wise strongly connected. Still, the concept of  X  X upport X  or linkage is indirect in defining the similarity of categorical data, and also makes the clustering process complicated.

Gibson et al. introduced STIRR [ 21 ], an iterative algorithm based on non-linear dynamical systems. STIRR represents each attribute value as a weighted vertex in a graph. Starting with the initial conditions, the system is iterated until a  X  X ixed point X  is reached. When the fixed point is reached, the weights in one or more of the  X  X asins X  isolate two groups of attribute valuesoneachattribute.Eventhoughitisshownthatthisalgorithmworksfortheexperimental datasets having two partitions, it is challenging to determine the optimal number of clusters solely with this algorithm.

Chengetal.[ 16 ]appliedtheentropyconceptinnumericalsubspaceclustering,andCoolcat [ 6 ] introduced the entropy concept into categorical clustering. Coolcat is kind of similar to KModes. However, Coolcat assigns the item to a cluster that minimizes the EE. Considering the cluster centers may shift, a number of worst-fitted points will be re-clustered after a batch. Even though Coolcat approach introduces the entropy concept into its categorical clustering algorithm, it did not consider the problem of finding the optimal number of categorical clusters. Coolcat, Information Bottleneck [ 22 , 33 ], LIMBO [ 3 ], and the method developed in this paper are based on minimizing the same entropy criterion. The closely related work also includes Co-clustering [ 18 ] and Cross-association [ 12 ]. Entropy criterion is also discussed under the probabilistic clustering framework [ 30 ].
 Most of the recent research in categorical clustering is focused on clustering algorithms. Surprisingly, there is little research concerning about the cluster validation problems for categorical datasets. The  X  X est K X  problem has been discussed in terms of numerical data, especially with the mixture models. AIC and BIC [ 25 ] are the major model-based criteria for determining the best mixture model (with the  X  X est K X ). They have been used widely in validating the Gaussian mixture based numerical clustering. They are supposed to also be effective if appropriate mixture models are used for categorical data, among which Multino-mial mixture is usually used to model categorical data. As model-based clustering fits data into assumed models, exceptions can happen when the assumed model is not appropriate. We compare the Multinomial-mixture based BIC criterion and our BKPlot method. Experimental results show that the BKPlot method has unique advantages in determining the best Ks: (1) it can determine all the best Ks for multi-layer clustering structures, while BIC cannot; (2) clusteroverlappingcancreatecertaindifficultyforBIC,butBKPlotcansuccessfullyhandleit. 8Conclusion Most of the recent research about categorical clustering has been focusing on clustering algo-rithms only. In this paper, we propose an entropy-based cluster validation method. Specifi-cally, we address three problems: (1) identifying the best Ks for categorical data clustering; (2) determining whether a dataset contains significant clustering structure; (3) developing theory for handling large datasets. Our idea is to find the best Ks by observing the entropy diffe-rence between the neighboring clustering results of K and K + 1 clusters, respectively. The  X  X est-K plot (BKPlot) X  is used to conveniently identify the critical Ks. BKPlots generated by different algorithm may have different performance in identify the significant clustering structures. In order to find the robust BKPlot, we also develop a hierarchical algorithm ACE based on a new inter-cluster entropy criterion  X  X ncremental Entropy X . Our experiments show that, the BKPlot method can precisely identify the best Ks and ACE algorithm can generate the most robust BKPlots for various experimental datasets.

In addition, we also address the problems with large datasets and develop the theory of sample BKPlots for finding the best Ks for very large datasets. The result is extended to analyzing the datasets having no clustering structure. Sample no-cluster datasets are used to generate statistical tests for determining whether a given dataset has significant clustering structure.
