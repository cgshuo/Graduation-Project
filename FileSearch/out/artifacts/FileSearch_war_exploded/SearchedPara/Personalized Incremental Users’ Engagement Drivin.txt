 Successful contributors in online communities go through a lifecycle of membership status starting from the periphery and moving to the core over time. We argue that a per-sonalized incremental engagement strategy can mobilize a larger proportion of members through this process. This paper presents our approach to identify a progression of contributions in an online community and the design of per-sonalized incremental engagement strategy which will drive users X  contributions one step forward. The results of our field study show that the personalized incremental approach sig-nificantly boosts contributions in an online community for academic conferences.

It has been observed that building sustainable online com-munities is a challenging task. Even the most successful ex-amples of these communities face key challenges such as en-couraging contributions, developing commitment and social-izing newcomers [22]. For example, Wikipedia  X  X ith about four million articles and 16 million registered users in the En-glish version X  still faces important challenges. According to the statistics published by the WikiMedia Foundation, only .03% of Wikipedia users can be considered active contribu-1 h ttp://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia users created by 10% of its users [28]. Sixty percent of Wikipedia editors never edit another article after the first day of mem-bership [29]. Beyond these successful examples, many efforts to build online communities fail and the community never reaches the critical mass necessary to become self-sustaining. For example, a third of online mailing lists are inactive over a four-month period [10]. Only 10.3% of the Open Source projects that have been created in SourceForge have more than three members [33].

Diverse research methodologies have been used to under-stand why users participate in online communities [37, 34, 6]; how to socialize newcomers [8, 13]; how to foster users X  commitment [35, 32]; and how to leverage contribution lev-els [2, 23]. In particular, a number of projects focusing on increasing user engagement in online communties have been motivated by goal-setting theory [25]. This theory indicates that goal-setting strongly motivates people, especially when the goals are specific and challenging. Researchers have ex-plored ways of increasing the motivational impact of goal-setting by combining it with other user engagement strate-gies. For example, adding rewards and enhancing reputation for achieving a goal can increase users X  contributions in an enterprise social network site [12].

While prior research has confirmed the effectiveness of goal-setting, supplementary engagement strategies lead onto mixed results. For example, rewards and enhanced reputa-tion increased contributions in an enterprise social network site but it also encouraged undesirable behavior such as gam-ing and it interfered with users X  intrinsic motivation to con-tribute [12]. While one study reports that mentioning com-munity or personal goals did not significantly increase the number of contributions [2], another study shows that show-ing community or personal goals increased the users X  contri-bution levels [31]. We hypothesize that a plausible expla-nation for these mixed results can be that the effectiveness of the engagement mechanisms depends on users X  character-istics, and not solely on the engagement mechanism itself. The research presented in this paper is an attempt to ex-plore whether adapting user engagement strategies to users X  characteristics increases the effectiveness of the engagement strategy.

Members of online communities can differ in a range of characteristics such as gender, age, cultural background, ex-perience with the system, level of digital literacy, and roles in the community. All of these characteristics may be impor-tant in creating personalized engagement strategies. How-ever, privacy and data collection burdens limit access to many of these characteristics. The goal of our research is t o identify user characteristics that could be easily acquired from most types of online communities. In a preliminary study, we explored several easy-to-acquire parameters such as users X  previous experience with the system. We observed that effectiveness of user engagement messages correlates with users X  status in the system. For example, newcomers were more likely to visit the site in response to an invita-tion to participate than current members of the site [26]. The study presented in this paper attempts to take the next step: to explore whether user status can serve as a basis for adapting engagement strategies.

In this paper, we define user status to mean the extent and the type of users X  past contributions to the community. It has been recognized that members of online communities go through a lifecycle of membership status starting from the periphery and moving to the core over time [30]. For example, contributors in Wikipedia start making small edits in articles and then progressively increase the magnitude of their contributions [17]. A similar pattern was found in open source software development. New developers begin their contributions by reporting bugs and then those motivated to contribute further get more involved in the community and increase the significance of their contributions [38].
We hypothesize that strategies that encourage users to perform a task are more effective if the proposed task is an extension of previous activities. On the other hand, the strategies which ignore the users X  prior status are less effec-tive. We assess engagement with the system by measuring the users X  interaction with the system including their brows-ing activities and contributions. To test this hypothesis, we designed a personalized goal-setting mechanism to encour-age users to move one step forward in their membership status. The mechanism is based on a progression of pos-sible actions in the community that are introduced to the users in order to engage them in new and more sophisticated tasks. We implemented this approach in an online commu-nity for academic conferences and evaluated its effectiveness in a field study. The results show that our personalized incremental engagement mechanism was significantly more effective in encouraging users to participate in the system than a non-personalized one. Particularly, personalization fostered contributions from users with who had prior expe-rience in the community.
This work is focused on personalized incremental engage-ment messages that consider the users X  current status and encourage them to progress to the next stage of participa-tion. While we believe that this approach is innovative, it has roots in two areas -user engagement in online commu-nities and personalized user interfaces. This section reviews the relevant work in both areas.
Encouraging contributions to online communities has been the focus of several research studies. Two major approaches are (1) manipulating the interface of the social site to reflect a particular intervention (e.g. [7, 9, 11, 12, 19, 31]) and (2) sending direct messages to participants (e.g. [2, 8]). Each approach has advantages and drawbacks. To be effective, it is important to employ the appropriate strategy based on the characteristics of the online community.

Interface changes can be more visible and influential since every time a user is in the system they are exposed to the intervention. At the same time, the cost of making interface changes is much higher than sending messages. Moreover, users who do not login to the system are not exposed to the interface intervention at all. For sites with a small number of active users, changes in the interface might not be noticed by enough users to be effective. In those cases, sending direct messages can be more effective. Prior research has demonstrated that sending periodic reminders is effective in engaging users and boosting the overall participation in dif-ferent online communities [1, 2]. It provides users with a clear and specific goal which is shown to motivate contribu-tions [25]. Moreover, messages are effective in encouraging contributions by targeting individual users directly instead of broadcasting a request to the general audience [9]. In the current work, we have adopted direct messages as an ap-proach to implement our personalized engagement strategy.
While several studies have explored the value of sending direct messages in order to motivate users X  contributions, fewer works have examined how individual differences im-pact the effectiveness of these direct messages. Prior re-search suggests that users volunteer their time for many dif-ferent reasons and individuals have different motivations for contributing to volunteer organizations [6, 37]. Given the personal nature of direct messages, they provide a great op-portunity for adaptation. The content of messages can be adapted to individual differences to increase their effective-ness.

A recent study [7] in a movie recommender system demon-strated how individual differences modify the value of social feedback. In an experiment where users were presented with the median value of participation by the community, all the users demonstrated regression towards this central value of contributions. However, users with higher level of compet-itiveness demonstrated a different behavior. Competitive users who had been contributing less than the median value increased their contributions faster than the average user and those who were above the central value of contributions decreased their level of contribution slower than the average user. The authors suggest that designing a personalized en-gagement strategy can take advantage of these differences to achieve more effective results.

An analysis of newcomers X  socialization in Wikiprojects -a group of Wikipedia editors who collaborate on managing and writing a collection of pages on a specific topic, e.g., military history -shows that newcomers who received per-sonalized welcoming messages demonstrated higher levels of contribution and commitment to the project while those re-ceiving standardized messages decreased their level of con-tribution and commitment to the group.

Personalized task routing algorithms offer another exam-ple of how personalization improves users X  motivation. Wikipe-dia editors are significantly more likely to respond to an editing request if the request takes into account their per-sonal interest area and ask them to edits articles related to their interest [9]. The personalized messages reduced the effort required to figure out how to contribute by suggesting tasks that were needed and matched the user interests. A similar result was achieved in the movie recommender sys-tem [19]. Messages requesting movie ratings which consid-e red users X  movie interests were more successful than those which ignored personal interests. A recent study reported that users X  motivations influence their patterns of contri-butions in online communities. For example, users with a stronger pro-social behavior are more likely to edit resources. The authors of this paper proposed personalized interfaces designed considering the users X  motivations [18].
In this work, we propose an approach to personalize en-gagement strategy by considering users X  prior activity in the system. Our work complements prior work in personalized engagement strategies by attempting to identify easy-to-acquire users X  characteristics that can guide a personalized incremental approach for user engagement.
The problem of adapting system behavior to individual users has been extensively explored in the areas of user modeling [16], adaptive interfaces [36], and adaptive Web systems in general [4]. This area is sometimes referred to as automatic personalization as the personalization of system behavior is produced not by the user (user-driven personal-ization is also known as customization), but by intelligent algorithms that take into account various user features and parameters. Personalized incremental user engagement can be considered as a specific strategy in this area and it has connections to two prior research streams in this field -adap-tive help systems and incremental interfaces.

Adaptive help systems [3], also known as intelligent help systems [20], attempt to provide effective assistance to a user of a sophisticated information system by considering the user X  X  anticipated goals and level of knowledge. To provide this support, they predict users X  most likely next actions based on the history of past actions. If this prediction can be done well, an adaptive help system can serve the user when they ask for help. It can also proactively help by informing the user about important (but not yet used) functionality which can improve the user X  X  experience [16]. Prior research in the area of adaptive help introduced a number of powerful mechanisms for adaptive help. They range from relatively simple state transition diagrams and goal hierarchies [36] based on system analysis to advanced Bayesian networks [21] and social comparison models [24] based on extensive mining of user logs.

Similar ideas were explored in a related area of incremen-tal interfaces. The concept of the incremental interface is based on Fischer X  X  theory of user incremental learning in interactive systems [15]. Fischer argued that in complex in-teractive systems users learn about interface functionality incrementally, starting with a small subset of features and then progressing to more complicated subsets depending on the users tasks and needs. The idea of an incremental inter-face is to restrict the complicated user interface to the set of features that correspond to the users X  mastery subset by hiding more advanced features. Once the user masters the current subset, new features can be enabled and introduced to the user. The incremental interface was first explored in [5] in the context of Web systems and later adapted to the context of office applications in [14, 27].

The goal of both adaptive help and incremental interfaces is to determine what is the next most probable stage of user activity in the system and to help the user in advancing to this stage. In this work, we pursue a similar goal by personalizing incremental engagement strategies.
Conference Navigator (CN) [12] is an online community designed to help conference attendees make decisions about which talks to attend. CN guides conference attendees by augmenting the conference schedule with meta-information about talks such as popularity for a particular area of in-terest or user-defined tags describing a talk. CN provides recommendation of relevant talks to its users and enables them to rate these recommendations to further increase the quality of the recommendations. The users can also connect to other researchers in the field through the system. Fig-ure 1 presents an interface of CN showing the most popular talks. The talks are annotated with the number of users who scheduled this talk and whether the talk is recommended to the target user.

To assess the effect of a personalized incremental user en-gagement mechanism, we conducted a field study in CN dur-ing the 2011 User Modeling, Adaptation and Personaliza-tion Conference (UMAP). The conference offered CN before and during the conference. Conference attendees and au-thors of papers were invited to use CN few weeks before the conference began. Information about CN was displayed in the main page of the conference website and two reminders about the system were sent by email.
To implement our incremental user engagement strategy, first we need to identify users X  characteristics that are easily acquired and which will provide meaningful basis for per-sonalization. Second, we categorize users based on these characteristics and design a personalized engagement mech-anism that takes advantage of this categorization.
In a preliminary study, we observed that the user sta-tus in an online community can explain differences in their participation pattern in response to receiving messages en-couraging contributions [26]. We observed that newcomers responded to these messages by increasing their investiga-tion of the site while previous contributors responded to the messages by increasing their contributions.

To adapt personalized messages to a user X  X  status, the first step is to model a conceptual progression of possible contri-butions to the system. Performing log analysis of users X  actions in the site can inform the design of this model.
We analyzed usage behavior of 151 users from the UMAP community who logged on to the system prior to our field study. We considered users X  first 100 actions and divided their actions into bins of 10 actions. Figure 2 presents the proportion of different kinds of contributions among users X  actions. The results suggest a trend that users at the begin-ning focus their contributions on scheduling talks and over time they move to tagging talks and networking with other members. Among the first 20 actions of all users, all con-tributory actions are focused on scheduling. After the 50th, the users X  actions shift towards tagging and networking.
The results of log analysis suggest the existence of a pro-gression of actions. Users start contributing by scheduling papers and then they move to other contributory actions. The system X  X  usage data is not entirely conclusive about which action is more likely to be undertaken after schedul-ing. The rates of tagging and networking actions are very similar over the first 100 users X  actions. As the number of more advanced users is much lower, we do not have enough data to distinguish the importance of tagging versus net-working.

These results match our expectations of system usage. CN was designed as a conference support system, therefore, the most basic and expected contributions of users is to schedule a talk in which they are interested. Second, they will add tags and eventually consider connecting with other confer-ence attendees. Once a user has provided enough informa-tion to the system, CN can recommend relevant talks to the user. Afterwards, the user can rate the usefulness of these recommendations. However, none of the users had rated their recommendations before running this field study.
Based on these observations and the expected system us-age, we designed a model of users X  contributions in CN as shown in Figure 3. There are four primary types of con-tributions (1) scheduling a paper, (2) tagging a paper, (3) networking with other users, and (4) rating system recom-mendations.

Figure 3: Progression of Contributory Actions
We designed a field study to assess the effect of person-alized incremental user engagement strategies based on the progression of actions described in the previous section. We hypothesize that, in comparison with non-personalized mes-sages, personalized incremental user engagement that takes into account current user status increases participation in the site. The increased participation will be revealed by more visits and more contributions to the site. Therefore, our hypotheses are: We categorized CN users into three groups: Newcomers, Inactive Users and Active Contributors. We define newcom-ers as those who agreed to be registered in the system but never logged in, inactive users as those who have been mem-bers of the site but have not been active in either visiting the site or contributing to the site, and active contributors as those who have scheduled at least five talks.

Users in each category are randomly assigned to one of two possible conditions: non-personalized or personalized. All users in the non-personalized condition received the same message independent of being a newcomer, an inactive user, or an active contributor. The message encouraged them to contribute to the site by scheduling or tagging the talks which are the necessary action for the users to receive a better quality recommendation. Users in the personalized condition received a message adapted to their status and what they had already done in the system. Newcomers were asked to schedule a talk. Inactive users (who had not done any scheduling) were asked to schedule and those who had scheduled a few talks were asked to tag papers. Active con-tributors were asked to rate the quality of recommendations they received from the system. Partial samples of the per-sonalized messages are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Fig-ure 6 illustrates part of the non-personalized message.
W e designed the requested task in all the messages to focus on improving the quality of system recommendation to keep the goal the same for all of the users. We decided to avoid promoting the networking actions as an option for active contributors since networking would not have contributed to the quality of recommendations.
The study included 127 users who were UMAP 2011 at-tendees, authors and previous users of the system who at least visited the schedule of UMAP 2011. We compared users X  participation in the site, both in terms of browsing and contributing, one week after receiving the message.
Table 1 presents the number of users in each group who responded to the messages by visiting or contributing to the site. Overall, 43 out of 127 users receiving the messages visited the system within the following week. Significantly larger number of users in the personalized group responded to the message (28 (43%) vs. 15 (24%),  X  2 = 5.053, p = 0.025).
 Table 1: Engagement Statistics for Each Group Group Strategy Total Engaged (%)

C ontributors pers. -rating 19 8 (42.1) non-pers.: non-personalized; pers.: personalized.
T he general statistics on participation before and after the field study are shown in Table 2. Scheduling, tagging and rating recommendations were the actions advertised in the engagement messages. Among them, scheduling remains the most popular type of contributions which increased by 50% (378 new scheduling actions) as a result of the field study. The field study had the most significant effect on increasing tagging behavior by 146% which is partially due to little tagging activities prior to the field study. However, the field study was less successful in motivating ratings of recommendations: it resulted in only ten new ratings.
Table 3 reports the number of actions and contributions f or each group of users. Newcomers perform the largest share of browsing actions in the system and they contribute the most along with the inactive users. Previously active contributors exhibit the least number of contributions.

Our response variable is the count of actions, which is over-dispersed due to large number of users with no actions. Therefore, negative binomial best describes the distribution of this variable. We used negative binomial re-gression to predict participation in the system given our ex-perimental condition denoted as  X  X trategy X . This variable is coded as zero for those who have received non-personalized messages and one for those who received the personalized messages. To include users X  previous status in the system, we included their prior contributions in the model, denoted as  X  X rior contributions X  and we included the interaction of their status with the engagement strategy (the experimental condition).
To assess our first hypothesis, we measured users X  over-all participation by calculating the total number of visits to the site as well as the number of visits to the recommenda-tions page during the week after receiving the engagement messages.

To predict the overall number of actions, we controlled for users X  prior activity level by including users X  prior number of actions in the model, denoted as  X  X rior actions X . The result of regression analysis is shown in Table 4 and Table 5. The model is significant,  X  2 = 13 . 821 , df = 4 , p &lt; . 008. There is a main effect of the engagement strategy. Personalized messages doubled ( e . 743 = 2 . 1) the number of visits to the site compared to the non-personalized messages. There is neither a main effect of prior actions nor an effect of prior contributions. This unexpected result is probably related to the fact that a major share of new actions were performed by newcomers who had no previous actions or contributions. There is no interaction between users X  status and engage-ment strategy.

We are particularly interested in visits to the recommen-d ation pages because they were explicitly mentioned in all of the engagement messages. To predict the number of vis-its to recommendation pages, we controlled for users X  prior visits to those pages. As a result, the model includes the experimental condition, the number of visits to recommen-dations before the study (prior recommendation), the num-ber of prior contributions and the interaction effect between number of prior contributions and the experimental condi-tion. The model is significant,  X  2 = 31 . 469 , df = 4 , p &lt; . 001. Table 6 and 7 shows the results of the regression.
Similar to overall actions, there is a main effect of the en-gagement strategy. Personalized messages increased number 7 . 55) compared to the non-personalized messages. The ef-fects of prior visits to recommendations, previous contri-butions and the interaction between contributions and the engagement strategy are not significant.

Compared to the non-personalized engagement messages, the personalized incremental messages increases participa-tion in the system as well as the number of visits to those specific pages mentioned in the engagement messages. For both of the dependent variables, the effect of users X  prior levels of participation in the system is not significant.
To test our second hypothesis, we measured users X  contri-butions by calculating the total number of talks they sched-uled, number of tags they added, number of recommenda-tions they rated, and number of connections they added to their network. Again, we use negative binomial regression to model the levels of contributions with the same indepen-dent variables as described in Section 6.2. The regression model is significant,  X  2 = 73 . 731 , df = 4 , p &lt; . 001. Table 8 and Table 9 details the result of the regression analysis.
Similar to the participation measures, there is a main ef-f ect of the engagement strategy on number of contributions. Personalized messages increase the total number of contri-butions by 6.33 ( e 1 . 846 = 6 . 33) times compared to the non-personalized messages. Moreover, there is a significant in-teraction between the engagement strategy and the users X  prior level of contributions. Users who contributed less pre-viously were more likely to increase their contributions as a result of receiving the personalized messages. For every unit of increase in prior contributions, the expected number of contributions decreases by a factor of 0.87 ( e  X  . 131 = The effect size of the personalized message is considerably larger than the interaction effect size, therefore the negative effect of personalization is more relevant among more active prior contributors than those who had contributed only few times.

The results support our second hypothesis. The personal-ized incremental engagement messages significantly increase the number of contributions. However, these personalized messages particularly increase contributions from less active users.
This paper reports the results of implementing a person-alized engagement method in a social system for academic conferences. Our log analysis of users X  behavior in our re-search platform confirms findings of prior research that sug-gests members of online communities follow a progressive pattern of contributions. This progression can serve as a basis for personalization. Our work complements prior re-search on personalized user engagement by identifying users X  characteristics which are easily acquired in a majority of on-line communities and which affect the success of incentive mechanisms.

We were successful in strengthening the effect of goal-setting by emphasizing a goal which naturally follows the current status of a user. Our results suggest that personal-ized messages requesting users to perform a particular kind of contributions that follows their current pattern of partic-ipation in the system can increase users X  engagement wit h the system. A detailed analysis looking at the effect of per-sonalized messages on interaction with users X  prior contribu-tions reveals that the effectiveness of personalized messages decreases as the number of prior contributions increases.
Less active users who do not have a clear idea of how to contribute will benefit from a personalized message which recommends the most appropriate kinds of contributions. Our results also suggest that active users were not influenced by our personalization mechanism as much as users with less experience. The lack of more conclusive data about activ-ity pattern of more advanced users may have contributed to this result. From the log data, it is clear that the initial con-tribution is scheduling, however tagging and networking are competing to be the most likely subsequent kind of contribu-tion and rating recommendations is not even present. It is possible that a lack of data has resulted in a weak model of what most attracts advanced users. It is also possible that experienced users may not benefit from personalization in general. Messages suggesting only one kind of contribution might contradicts their own idea of contribution. Our future research will further investigate this aspect.

An important goal for online communities is diversifying contributions from different kind of users. There are sim-ple kinds of actions that a majority of users can contribute to the system, e.g. bookmarking a resource. On the other hand, there are actions that require more expertise with the system or more effort. Those actions usually are not per-formed by new users since they do not have the knowledge and they have not developed enough commitment for more effort-demanding actions. Personalized incremental engage-ment incentives can achieve the goal of diversification of ac-tions by guiding the users through a sequence of action as they move through the lifecycle of membership in the sys-tem. In the current work, we have succeeded in focusing users X  attention on a particular feature of the system, talk recommendation, by emphasizing that feature in the engage-ment messages. We were able to transfer users X  effort from mostly scheduling to scheduling and tagging. However, we did not fully achieve the goal of broadening types of contri-butions as ratings of recommendations remained very low.
The results of this study offer insights for the designers of online communities. Personalization is particularly impor-tant for users with little experience with the system. They are not familiar with the system and can have difficulty iden-tifying ways to contribute to the system. Personalization re-duces the cost for participation of a user uncertain of how to contribute by providing specific tasks. It provides goals that focus the users X  effort on the sequence of actions suitable for their current status.

On the other hand, as the users become more familiar with the system and start finding ways they can contribute, personalization may harm their level of engagement with the system. As modeling active contributors is harder, person-alization might suggest actions that may not match with the users X  interest. Additionally, it may create a sense that the system does not trust in what they have identified as their role. This sense of distrust then can decrease their engagement with the system. Personalization can also in-terfere with the way the users are intrinsically interested to contribute to the system.
The results of this study have to be considered in view of its limitations. First, the number of engaged users in each subgroup is small which follows the general pattern of par-ticipation inequality in online communities. Therefore, it is important to start with a bigger community of users in w hich the standard response rate will result in more signifi-cant participation for different experimental conditions. As in any field study, there is also a selection bias in our sub-jects sample. Additionally, our research platform, which is related to a physical event, may also differ from other com-pletely virtual online communities, therefore our results may not be directly transferable to other kind of online commu-nities. We believe that replication of our study is necessary to offer more robust results.

Second, all of the engagement messages emphasized the benefit of contributing as increasing the quality of the rec-ommendations. This might have discouraged users who were not interested in recommendations. Particularly, this goal ignores the social features of the system and focuses the users X  contributions on individual benefits. It is important to study the effect of our personalization approach on interac-tion with different types of goals, especially more community-oriented goals. In this case, personalized approaches can take into account the importance of different kind of goals for different group of users.

The goal of both adaptive help and incremental interfaces is quite similar to the goal of personalized incremental en-gagement strategies, which is to determine what is the next most probable stage of user activity in the system and to help the user to advance to this stage. This similarity makes it feasible to use selected advanced strategies of user and community modeling developed in the past in the areas of adaptive help and incremental interfaces for the purpose of personalized engagement. While our current work uses a relatively simple state-transition, we plan to explore more sophisticated technologies in our future work. [1] M. Abdolrasulnia, B. C. Collins, L. Casebeer, T.
