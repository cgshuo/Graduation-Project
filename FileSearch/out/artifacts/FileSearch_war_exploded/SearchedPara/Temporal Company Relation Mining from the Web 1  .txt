 problems and to make decision in the company. Other applications analyze un-structured data as well within companies or from the Web to discover relations among companies, but those relation types are limited to single or a few. Therefore, the exist-or multiple companies. 
Our research aims to mine temporal company relations from the Web. It can guar-antee the recall of relation discovery by collecting huge amount of data on the Web. Also it can create a global view of the business relation by tracking multiple kinds of stock share) between companies. After extracting temporal and multiple type relation challenge in web information extraction. 
The novel features of our approach are: 1) we deal with temporal relations among companies, which best reflect the trend of business, using data from the Web; 2) we deal with multiple types of relations among companies, which give an overall view of business. conclude it in section 5. algorithms. 2.1 Business Activity Analysis Application into three types. 
The first type uses the structured data within a company, but does not deal with re-lations between companies. For instance, Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) is software that aids in monitoring business activities [14]. Customer Relationship Man-agement (CRM) collects customer information within a company and does data min-structured data is simple to process. 
The second type analyzes company relations based on the collected structured or tionship analysis technology [7]. Grey et al. presented a supply-chain analysis method includes thousands of small companies, it becomes difficult to collect enough volume of detailed activity data. analyzes them [11][19]. Morinaga et al. proposed a temporal users X  opinions analysis system, which only deals with a single simple relation between companies and prod-ucts [15]. Liu et al. proposed a novel system for using the Web to discover compara-ble cases [13]. Liu et al. presented a web site comparison system [12]. These systems relation. 
Our work belongs to the last type, a web data mining application. In the real world, multiple types of relations do exist at the same time [3], and they always have impact comprehensive mining of multiple types of company relation mining is required. 2.2 Information Analysis and Graph-Based Analysis In company relation mining, a company X  X  relations can be modeled as a graph. How to create a graph accord ing to data sources and how to do analysis on this graph are two main topics for this kind of algorithm. 
How to create a graph depends on what kind of data this system is using. Some al-gorithms extract relations from un-structured data like text and HTML pages. This is challenging problem in terms of the accuracy. Some other algorithms mine useful [1][8][10]. These approaches don X  X  deal with the temporal graph. How to do company relation analysis is a conventional graph analysis problem. Social network analysis is a typical method. It includes a set of techniques for identi-fying and representing patterns of interaction among social entities. It can be applied kind of conventional social network analysis technology tends to compute the central-analytic feature of temporal event detection. graph, we developed new technologies to detect important events on the temporal graph, while the existing technologies mainly handle a non-temporal graph. 3.1 Overview the following steps. (1) The first step is to extract temporal relation instances from the created based on these relation instances. (3) And the significance of each company at a specific time is calculated based on its temporal graph, and comprehensive relations pany relationships, and weighted nodes corresponding to companies. (4) Business architecture of our method is shown in Figure 1. 3.2 Relation Instance Extraction Figure 2 shows an example. 
The part of content displayed with red color font contains the information of com-petition relations between companies. This part means that  X  X racle X  has  X  X ompeti-template for HTML page to extract such information. 
We set some candidates of relation types, and ask people to look in news corpus to see which type appears more frequently. Finally we decide six types of relation, com-best ones. They represent an overall view on business. based method. But a rule-based method has its disadvantages. It requires a lot of hu-our system. Figure 3 shows our method to extract relation instance. At first, the input tagged. The SVM-based classifier called  X  X VM sifter X  is designed to select the candi-candidates X . 
The NLP-rule-based extractor (RE) performs syntactic analysis on the instance input news sentence has already been segmented and tagged with POS. Here all company names, addresses, industry names and key verbs. All matched words with every rule. The instance candidates could be classified into three parts: The first part contains no subjects (company names) and matches none of the pre-define rules, and it is discarded directly. The second part matches one or more rules, and it is col-lected as the accepted relation instance. The third part contains subjects but does not match any rule. They will be output to the next step. gives high precision and low recall, while SVM arbiter amends recall in this case. 3.3 Temporal Relation Graph Creation Before creating the temporal relation graph based on the extracted instances, un-tion instances are false due to the error in our extractor. Secondly, we use publishing occurring time. Finally, there are conflictions among relation instances. 
Multiple types of relation were considered in our work. And some type of relation instances. This is an advantage of multiple type of relation. 3.3.1 Relation Instance Filtering 
There are two kinds of relation: 1) event-like relation, which can only occur once, the new relation strength of this kind of relation. direction with larger strength as the real relation direction and delete the other relation direction. tion, with a threshold. The relation strength which is smaller than a threshold is set to 0. Here the thresholds for event-like relation and continuous relation are different. 
Finally we solve the confliction between special relation types. If an event-like re-time t 0 ; otherwise we filter out relation X 1 . 3.3.2 Temporal Relation Interpolation For the continuous relation, the relation always continues for a time period. But from the relation instances, we can only see some relation occur at some specific time but not occur at other time. The interpolation could be done to guarantee the continuous interpolation just works. 
Now we have each type of temporal relation. These temporal relations could be used to create temporal graphs. Each company corresponds to a node of a graph, and each relation corresponds to a link of a graph. And the weight of a link is equal to the strength of the related relation. 3.3.3 Comprehensive Relation Calculation very complex. We could build a comprehensive relation between all companies. The comprehensive relation between two companies shows how deeply they relate to each relation strength of each relation type and sum them up. The weight for every type of relation could be calculated with the probability of each type of relation. And in case relation types are calculated. 3.4 Business Event Detection relation graph, the trend in companies and industry are more likely to be discovered. 3.4.1 Company Significance Calculation ger significance if it has more relations with other companies. We use the significance of a node in this graph to represent the significance of a company. 
We use PageRank [16] to compute the significance. Assuming the adjacent matrix cance of i th company. And we normalize it to let the biggest one always be equal to 1. 
The graph we used is the comprehensive relation graph. The significance changes over time, so we compute the significances of all companies at every time unit. Then all the significances of a company form a temporal significance chart. 3.4.2 Rule-Based Business Event Detection Business events depend highly on the prior knowledge. Each domain has its own Rules are compiled by people with prior business knowledge. The example rules are shown as follows: 1) For Company A, if 2) For Company A, if The simplest event is acquisition and merging event, which could be detected directly through analyzing the acquisition and incorporation relation strength. 4.1 System Implementation 255 companies, which produce/sell computer and electronics products, were col-lected. The aliases of each company were prepared manually. For instance,  X 3M X ,  X  X MM X  are aliases of 3M Corporation. By search engines, 1.8 million web pages, tent, the title of every news article and the time stamp. And finally about 1.7 million of articles were successfully extracted. 
More than 4,000 sentences were tagged for training SVM sifter and SVM arbiter, garding its extraction accuracy, closed test was done on the tagged samples. And the 8069, 1952, 14108, 1764 instances for cooperation, competition, acquisition, incorpo-ration, supply chain and stock share were detected respectively. 
Month and year were used as time units to build the temporal graph. In order to aid visual comparison in the graph, relation strength was normalized from absolute value to a period of 0 to 1. 4.2 Extraction and Mining Results 4.2.1 Acquisition Event Detection Result We detected the following acquisition events in Table 1. Each row in Table 1 shows an acquisition event. The first company acquired the second company. 
Only one error, Novell/CNet acquisition, is in this set. This is caused by the falsely extracted acquisition relation instance. 
There are two types of acquisition relationships. One is that one company acquires the other company entirely. The other is that one company acquires parts of the other company. We compare the significances of these two companies to tell the type. 
The significance of 3Com on Feb. 1997 is 0.1698. The significance of US Robotics on Feb. 1997 is 0.0003. From the significance chart of 3Com and US Robotics shown vertical blue line shown in Figure 4 indicates the acquisition date. All acquisition case 1~11 in Table 1 follow this rule. 
In Figure 5, IBM always has much larger significance than Lenovo. After the ac-quisition event date 2002-2-17, the significance of IBM did not decrease. So we can that when Lenovo acquired IBM X  X  department in 2002, IBM kept its leader status in 12~15 in Table 1 are this kind of acquisition relationship. 4.2.2 Complicated Event Detection Example edge is required to obtain it. Here we give some as an example. 
We show a part of the competition relation graph in 1995, 1996 and 1997 respec-corresponds to a competition relation between two companies. The number labeled on links to other companies which do not appear in this graph. The companies shown in graph. We could display the whole graph and detect the same event. But the graph is too large to be displayed in a page. So what we show here is the part of the graph. 
The nodes in the left frame in Figure 6 form a relatively independent group. These which mainly reports about company activities in countries where English is the native language, especially in the 1990 X  X . We could infer that in 1995 these Japanese compa-group. In 1996, they remain as a group but some of them begin to compete with com-panies in the western world. The precedents are Sony, Toshiba and NEC. In 1997, the original members are divided into two parts. The first one remained in this group. This group evolved into a group producing camera related products. Other Japanese compa-community. But Panasonic is an exception. Though it belongs to the big community, it only has competition relation with the original group member. 
In this procedure, Sony, Toshiba are more open than other companies. This predicted their future development opportunity in some sense. The significance comparison between Sony and Panasonic is shown in Figure 9. We could see that though their starting points are almost same in 1995 in the western world market, Sony developed much better than Panasonic subsequently in western world market, especially from 1995 to 1997. Web. Based on the temporal graphs we created, we developed a new approach on business event mining. The experiments showed that this temporal relation mining approach can be applied on large amounts of data. The results showed some interesting cases. more work on it. Here, we give some future directions. information extraction accuracy by using multi-source information fusion. 
We plan to do automated industry and sub-industry clustering based on the relation graphs. Because of the data we collected, the companies are not easy to be clustered on more companies from diverse industries. 
The proposed method can be easily expanded to support multiple languages. Actu-ally, it has been applied to several other languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese) and gen-erated similar result as English. With multi-lingual support, it enables to build a more global view on the business environment. We thank Hong Wu, Genqing Wu and Jianming Jin for their initial work on this paper.
