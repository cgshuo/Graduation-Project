In fact, author modeling and author ranking tasks have been studied for a long time in previous research, and made fruitful achievements. Among them, the most simple, easy, but effective ranking indicator is citation counts [2], which mean that the impor-tance of publications/authors is higher than others with more citation counts. Howev-er, the limitation of this method is caused by a fundamental problem of bibliometrics: topical information. 
To overcome this limitation, we proposed a novel author ranking method based on window along with its topic distribution. The remainder of this paper is organized as findings and limitations of this paper and identify subsequent research steps. the author network. The most common approach is citation count [2]. Besides, impact articles measuring the author ranking by hyperlink graph, a common method is Page-based graph, webpages, publications or authors graph. 
While most of these methods are topic independent, which cannot be used for mea-suring author ranking based on selected topic. Actually, most traditional researches of fact, topic modeling is also a valuable method for determining the diverse importance White and Smyth [9] first proposed the priors idea in their formalization of a relative-rank extension to both PageRank and HITS. session. 3.1 Author Graph Based on Full-Text Extraction Most previous studies for citation network analysis in bibliometrics are based on one papers, as:  X   X   X  X  X  X   X   X ,  X   X ,  X   X , X ,  X   X  .

E as a set of edges means the relationships between authors generated from citation network. One vertex could have more than one edge to the other vertex. For edges of  X  more than one time in different locations.  X  characterize it when creating the graph [10]. like  X ... ...[number]... ... X ,  X ... ...[number-number]... ...

Meanwhile, we also used the text content to represent each author vertex, where all LDA algorithm. 3.2 Topic Modeling Based on Labeled-LDA  X  and label, and the cooccurrence probability of label and word, respectively. papers) and citation edge (citation context window), can infer the possible topics dis-tribution for each text by using Labeled-LDA modeling, and get two matrices respec-PageRank with prior is introduced to author ranking by these two distributions. 3.3 PageRank with Prior with reciprocal quotations and references, i.e. citation analysis and author ranking. this reason, unlike classical PageRank, PageRank with prior algorithm [11] calculates are more important than others for certain topic. For instance, for some authors, based ic topics, and they should be more important than other authors in their areas. At the same time, each edge is characterized by a transitioning topic probability distribution based on the citation context, which means citing author X  X  credits on a topic are more topic between them is high. score of each vertex (author) based on each topic, as: where  X   X   X  X  , and the transitioning probability score of edge can be calculated as: Rank with prior can be calculated as: This equation represents a Markov chain for a random surfer who transitions  X  X ack X  tioning probability  X   X , X   X  .

For  X  X  X   X  , we will calculate the ranking scores for these three nodes: 3.4 Evaluation Method the  X  X round truth X  for author ranking with topic independence, some review or survey the relatively important a u cited authors may be diffe r to characterize the impor t author  X  twice and au t Importance  X  X  X  target review paper, then t h also assume that if an aut h importance is equal to 4.

As shown in the tables and figures, we got positive results. PageRank alone (topic independent) performed the worst (as this is topic independent), while PageRank with prior achieved the best result both for MAP and nDCG (with t-test p&lt;0.001). For this importance. As show in the right figure above, it X  X  clear that PageRank with prior is always better than all other baseline methods, and the results are significant. In this paper, we first create an author citation network with 14,222 authors as vertic-(citation context) improved the performance. Then, Labeled-LDA algorithm is em-evaluating our approach compared with some other baselines. Based on the evaluation results of MAP@n and nDCG@n, we found that PageRank with prior can produce reliable high quality topic ranking results. located by regular expression can hardly handle all the publications, only 67.7% were extracted, because of citation format and encoding problems. So, for future work, we optimize the ranking algorithm.
