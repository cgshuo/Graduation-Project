 Many companies have started to use Enterprise Social Net-works (ESNs), such as Yammer, to facilitate collaboration and communication among their employees in the business context. Social link recommendation, which finds and sug-gests whom one wants to connect with in a company, is crucial for ESNs to promote their usages. Although link recommendation has been studied extensively in external so-cial networks (e.g., Facebook and Twitter), it has not been addressed in ESNs. In this paper, we study this novel prob-lem. Social link recommendation in ESNs is significantly di  X  erent from that in external social networks, and also has unique challenges: (1) people usually socialize di  X  erently in enterprise than in their personal life, but users X  social be-haviors in enterprise have not been well explored, and (2) there is important business information available in ESNs under the enterprise context, e.g., a company X  X  organiza-tional chart, but how to exploit it for link recommendation is still an open problem. To this end, we mine not only the social graph and user-generated content in ESNs, but also the company X  X  organizational chart, to model enterprise user social behaviors. We develop a supervised link recommen-dation algorithm using a large scale ESN based on Yammer (with over 100k users), which shows that the proposed tech-niques perform e  X  ectively. Moreover, we find that social graph and organizational chart are complementary to each other for link recommendation in ESNs.

Traditional social networks, e.g., Facebook and Twitter, usually provide services to help people deal with their per-sonal life issues. Recently, to facilitate the collaboration and communication among employees in companies, a new fam-ily of online social networks has been adopted inside the firewalls of many corporations. These social networks are called Enterprise Social Networks (ESNs) [34]. ESNs can potentially bring significant benefits to both employees and companies. For example, ESNs can help employees meet new colleagues [5], follow internal news and industry trends [32], identify experts [6] and form teams [20], etc.; ESNs can also bridge the generational gaps among employees with more communication [5]. One of the most popular ESNs is Yammer 1 .Over500 , 000 businesses around the world are using Yammer, including 85% of the Fortune 500 2 .
Arguably, social links/connections between people inside the company are key to ESNs. First, many services provided by ESNs are based on social connections. Taking Yammer as an example, one needs to follow another user in order to automatically receive relevant contents from the user. Sec-ond, as reported in [19], well-established connections among users can attract them to use the network more frequently. Thus, enterprise social link recommendation, which finds whom one wants to connect with in the company , is crucial for ESNs to promote their usages. Although link recommen-dation or link prediction has been studied extensively in ex-ternal social networks (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) [21, 13, 35], it has not been addressed in ESNs to the best of our knowledge.

Social link recommendation in ESNs is significantly dif-ferent from that in external social networks, and also has unique challenges: https://www.yammer.com/ https://about.yammer.com/why-yammer/ In this paper, we study this novel problem of Enterprise Social Link Recommendation. We mine not only the social graph and user-generated content in ESNs, but also the com-pany X  X  organizational chart, to model enterprise user social behaviors.
We develop a supervised link recommendation algorithm based on a large-scale ESN (i.e., Yammer with over 100k users), that can leverage all the proposed measures and heuristics. Our experiments show that the proposed tech-niques perform e  X  ectively, achieving a NDCG score of over 0 . 61 at the first recommendation position. Moreover, we find that the social graph and the organizational chart are complementary to each other for link recommendation in ESNs.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will briefly describe and analyze the Yammer network as well as giving the terminology definitions and problem for-mulation. Detailed information about the methods will be introduced in Section 3. In Section 4, we show the exper-iment results. Finally, in Sections 5-6, we introduce the related works and conclude this paper.
We use Yammer [34] in this paper to study the enter-prise social link recommendation problem. Yammer pro-vides users with various social services to facilitate their daily workloads, such as following other users, watching their posts and activities, creating/joining groups of their inter-ests, initiating conversations and writing posts, uploading Figure 1: ESN and Organizational Chart (faked ex-amples). and sharing files, sending online/o  X  ine messages to other users, etc. Yammer can be represented as a heterogeneous information network [26].

Definition 1. (Enterprise Social Networks): An enterprise social network can be represented as a heterogeneous infor-mation network G =( V , E ), where V = [ i V i and E = [ j are the sets of di  X  erent kinds of nodes and links in the en-terprise social network. For example, the Yammer can be represented as G =( V , E ), where V = U [ G [ C [ P contains the nodes of users, groups, conversations and posts, and social links among users, group membership links between users and groups, conversation initiation links between users and conversations, write links and like links between users and posts.

Are the social links between users in Yammer usually professional links that connect users in the same depart-ment? To answer this question, we compare the social links from Yammer and the organizational links from the orga-nizational chart. The organizational chart [34] denotes a diagram that outlines the internal hierarchic structure of a company and is the common visual depiction of how an or-ganization is structured. In most companies, managers can supervise many subordinates simultaneously, but each sub-ordinate only needs to report to one manager. As a result, the organizational charts are mostly tree-structure diagrams with the CEO at the root. The formal definition of organi-zational chart is given as follows:
Definition 2. (Organizational Chart): The organizational chart of a company can be represented as a rooted tree (i.e., a tree in which one node has been designated as the root) T =( N , L ,root ), where N and L are the sets of nodes and links of T . The root of tree T represents the CEO of the company.

By designating the root of the organizational chart T ,all the links in T will have a natural orientation, i.e., toward or away from the root. The tree order of nodes u, v (i.e., u  X  v i  X  there is one unique path from the root to v via u ) denotes that u is a manager of v . In addition, nodes in N can be associated with certain attributes (i.e., the business profile information of employees), which include the department , job title and working location , etc., of the employees.
We examine the social links in Yammer that have an overlap with the organizational links, i.e., one user in a so-cial link is the direct manager, subordinates, or peer of the other user. We observe that, on average, the probabilities for users to follow their direct manager, subordinates and peers are 23 . 4%, 11 . 2% and 9 . 5% respectively. Interestingly, we also observe that subordinates are more likely to follow their managers than managers to follow their subordinates.
On the one hand, this analysis result shows that organi-zational chart could help enterprise social link recommen-dation. For example, in Figure 1, we give an example of ESN and organizational chart. In the ESN, we have 4 users, among whom 3 potential links are to be recommended (i.e., the red dashed lines). Considering the scenario of linking Calvin ! Bob: merely based on the information in the so-cial network,  X  X ob X  and  X  X alvin X  have nothing in common, neither  X  X ommon friends X  nor  X  X ommon groups X . However, according to their relationship in the organizational chart, we observe that  X  X ob X  is actually the direct manager of  X  X alvin X , who should thus be among the recommendation results. On the other hand, organizational chart alone is still not enough and social links among users in ESN are di  X  erent from organizational links. By analyzing the ESN and organizational chart, we observe the overlap between the organizational links and social links is very small, which accounts for only 13% of the total social links.

Finally, the enterprise social link recommendation prob-lem can be formally defined as follows: Definition 3. (Enterprise Social Link Recommendation): For the given enterprise social network G and organizational chart T , the sets of users and existing social links among users in the enterprise social network G can be represented as U and E u ! u respectively. The set of candidate social links to be recommended can be represented as E rec = U  X  U\E u ! u In the enterprise social link recommendation problem, we use the existing links in E u ! u and information about these links in both network G and organizational chart T to build a model, which can score and rank the candidate links in E rec Candidate links that receive higher scores are expected to be more likely actually formed in the ESN. In this section, we introduce the S upervised EN terprise SO cial R ecommendation ( SENSOR ) method in details. We will explore both the enterprise social network and the or-ganizational chart to understand and model whom an em-ployee wants to connect with in the company from three dimensions: (1) user-user a nity, (2) user characteristics, and (3) user-generated content.
In social science,  X  X irds of a feather flock together X  [23].  X  X omophily X  [1] is an important principle in social science and that also structures the social ties among users greatly: close users are more likely to follow each other [27] in online social networks. In this paper, the social closeness among users is measured by the user-user a nity , which can be computed based on various information sources, e.g., online social behaviors, o  X  ine organizational relationships and ge-ographical user distributions.

Heterogeneous social activities from ESN can often cap-ture the social a nity among some users well. However, there are some inactive users and users who just join ESN for a very short period of time. Their sparse information in ESN would be inadequate to calculate their a nity to other users. In this case, fortunately, large amount of information from the o  X  ine workplace, e.g., organizational chart, can be exploited to bridge the gap by computing organizational a nity among users. Social a nity and organizational a n-ity employ information in ESN and organizational chart in-dependently, but do not take advantage of the deep knowl-edge that can only be obtained by aligning online ESN and o  X  ine organizational chart [34]. To remedy such a prob-lem, a set of social-organizational a nity features will be introduced. In addition, the user-user a nity may also be computed based on user geographical distributions, such as country, timezone and even o ce location, etc., which will be also explored in this section.
In enterprise social networks , users are connected, either directly or indirectly, by various types of connections, such as follow links, shared groups, etc., which could imply social a nity among users. We propose several novel methods to compute social a nity, such as weighted meta path and weighted group membership, inspired by the term weighting techniques in information retrieval [17].
For inactive and new users, the above introduced social a nity measures would not be very useful due to their sparse activity information in ESNs. However, in the enterprise context, useful alternative information about these users can be obtained, in particular, the organizational chart. We next introduce the organizational a nity, a set of a nity mea-sures among users calculated based on the organizational chart.

Company organizational chart is a tree structured dia-gram outlining the relationships among users, where users are connected by sequences of  X  X anagement X  links between managers and their subordinates. Given any two users, an intuitive idea to represent their a nity is using the number of required steps to walk to each other along the links in the organizational chart. Colleagues in the same department need less steps to connect from one to another than those in di  X  erent departments. Based on such an observation, we propose a novel a nity measure  X  organizational distance  X  Figure 2: Example of a nity measure extraction across hybrid aligned enterprise graphs for link ( u i ,u j ): the number of steps required to walking from u i to u j via the links in the the organizational chart.
However, as mentioned in Section 2, users are more in-terested in connecting to their managers than their subor-dinates. As a result, the organizational distance should be asymmetric. Specifically, if we let the organizational dis-tance from a user to any of his subordinates be 1, then the organizational distance from a user to his direct manager should be  X  &lt; 1. Our preliminary results show that  X  =0 . 7 works very well, which is also used throughout our exper-iments. For instance, based on the organizational chart in Figure 1, the organizational distance from  X  X alvin X  to  X  X ob X  is  X  , but that from  X  X del X  to  X  X ob X  is 1.

Besides the links, in the organizational chart, the employ-ees are associated with a set of attributes, which include their departments and job titles. Intuitively, people in the same department have a higher chance to know each other, and people with the same job title are more likely to work together and connect to each other (e.g., software engineer likes to connect to software engineer, while statistician likes to connect to statistician). In addition to the  X  organiza-tional distance  X , features denoting whether u i and u j (1) are in the same department, and (2) share the same title or not are extracted as another two a nity measures from the organizational chart.
The above two categories of a nity measures are extracted from the enterprise social network and the organizational chart independently . However, aligning the enterprise social network and organizational chart together [18, 33], many other interesting signals (which were not observable when using either the ESN or the organizational chart alone) arise that could capture the a nity among users from di  X  erent perspectives.

To illustrate, in Figure 2, we show part of the organiza-ing social links between u 1 and u 2 ,u 3 ,u 4 and u 6 . We observe that the users u 1 follows in ESNs, i.e., u 2 ,u 3 ,u 4 and u all closely working together with u 5 . We define the  X  group-mates  X  concept in this paper to represent such relationship between u 5 and { u 2 ,u 3 ,u 4 ,u 6 } .  X  X roupmates X  is essentially a union set of the user X  X  X  direct manager  X ,  X  peers  X  X nd X  direct subordinates  X . For example, based on organizational chart fragment in Figure 2, we can find u 5  X  X   X  groupmates  X  X obe { u 2 ,u 3 ,u 4 ,u 6 } , where u 2 and u 3 are the subordinates of u and u 4 and u 6 are u 5  X  X  peer and direct manager respectively.
Then, when predicting the social link ( u i ,u j ) in ESNs, if we observe that u i has followed a large number/proportion of  X  groupmates  X  X f u j , then u i is likely to be familiar with u group, and has a high probability to follow u j as well. For the example in Figure 2, we observe that u 1 has followed 4 of u 5  X  X  groupmates , then u 1 is likely to follow u 5 .Following this intuition, we propose to compute (1) the number of u  X  X  groupmates followed by u i , and (2) the percentage of u  X  X  groupmates followed by u i as two social-organizational a nity measures across both ESN and organizational chart.
Users who are in the same geo-location tend to have a higher chance to know each other, which thus may also be a possible signal for user-user a nity. We propose to also exploit information about users X  working locations, e.g., timezone, country, and longitude/latitude. In this paper, we compute several such geo-a nity features including (1) whether u i and u j are in the same timezone, (2) whether u and u j are in the same country, and (3) the geo-distance between u i and u j  X  X  working locations based on the longi-tude/latitude coordinate information.
To provide personalized recommendations so as to im-prove user experience, users X  personal characteristics play an important role. By analyzing the data, we observe that di  X  erent users have quite di  X  erent characteristics. For ex-ample, (1) some users like to follow users who have followed them but some other users seldom do so, (2) some users like to follow their managers but some other users like to follow their peers and subordinates, (3) some users like to follow their groupmates but some others like to follow employees in other divisions or departments.

To capture users X  characteristics and preferences when rec-ommending link ( u i ,u j ), a set of user characteristics fea-tures are designed for u i and u j , which includes: (1) the | managers, peers , and subordinates based on u i  X  X  existing follow links, (3) the sum and average of the organizational distance between u i ( u j ), and users that u i ( u j ) follows, (4) the number of users that u i ( u j ) follows and number of fol-lowers that u i ( u j ) has, (5) the average number of followers of users that u i follows, and the average number of followers of users who follow u j : 1 | well as 1 | of employees that u i and u j manage.
User-generated content can reveal important information about users, e.g., the activeness and popularity . Various types of content can be generated by users via their social activities in enterprise social networks, e.g., writing posts, initiating conversations, posting comments in the conversa-tions, and  X  liking  X  other users X  posts, etc. Based on these user-generated contents, we compute a set of related features for ( u i ,u j ), which include: (1) numbers of posts written by u and u j , (2) numbers of conversations initiated by u i and u , (3) the total and average numbers of  X  likes  X  that u i receives from other users, and (4) the total and average num-bers of comments posted in the conversations initiated by u (and u j ).
Link recommendation (or friend recommendation) services provided by online social networks aim at providing a ranked list of suggested social links (i.e., friends) for users. The setting of the standard link prediction problem [13, 27], es-sentially does point-wise prediction [3] of the existence of individual links. However, point-wise prediction has been shown ine  X  ective for ranking problem. Besides, there are often much more negative links than positive links in the training data, and pointwise classification-based link predic-tion su  X  ers from class imbalance problem [14]. Motivated by the e  X  ectiveness of the pairwise learning algorithms for learning to rank [22], we solve the link recommendation as a ranking problem rather than a pointwise prediction problem. Our later experiments also justify empirically our choice.
For a certain given user (corresponding query) u i , our link recommendation model aims at returning a set of friend can-didates in the decreasing order of their likelihood that u wants to follow a user. The query user u i together with his potential followees, e.g., u j , returned by link recommenda-tion model, can be represented as pair ( u i ,u j ). In the link recommendation problem, a set of features that depict ei-ther the relationships or the characteristics of users u i u are extracted from the network, which can be represented as vector x i,j . Besides the features, pair ( u i ,u j )islabeled with the relevance scores between the query user u i and his potential followee u j , which can be represented as y ( y i,j =1if( u i ,u j ) is connected and 0 otherwise).
Formally, both the positive and negative pairs in the train-ing set T can be represented as D = { ( x i,j ,y i,j ) } , ( u T , where x i,j 2 R k of length k is the feature vector extracted for pair ( u i ,u j ) and y i,j denotes the correlation between u and u j . Link recommendation can be formalized as building a regression function h : R k ! R , such that h ( x i,j )  X  y The regression model will be applied to users in the test set and can return the predicted existence confidence scores { h ( x i,j ) } for pairs consisting of the query user u i tential followees u j in the test set.

We use a state-of-the-art pairwise based regression algo-rithm, namely MART (Multiple Additive Regression Trees) [29], to develop a regression function. MART is based on the stochastic gradient boosting approach described in [7, 8] which performs gradient descent optimization in the func-tional space. In our experiments, we used the log-likelihood as the loss function, steepest-descent (gradient descent) as the optimization technique, and binary decision trees as the fitting function.
To evaluate the proposed techniques for enterprise social link recommendation, we conduct extensive experiments on a real-world enterprise social network Yammer used in a large IT company and its organizational chart. We crawl all the Microsoft employees X  information from Yammer and obtain the complete organizational chart in-volving all these employees in Microsoft during June, 2014 [34]. The social network data covers all the user-generated content (such as posts, replies, topics, etc.) and social graphs (such as user-user following links, user-group memberships, user-topic following links, etc.) by then that are set to be public. In summary, it includes more than 100 k Microsoft employees, and millions of user-generated posts published and the social links. 3
The social network data contains the complete informa-tion of all users till June 20, 2014. We treat the data before May 17, 2014 as the existing graph, which will be purely used to extract features. Users registered before May 17, 2014 are  X  old users  X  and users registered during May 17, 2014 -June 20, 2014 are  X  new users  X . Links formed during May 17, 2014 -June 20, 2014 are used as the positive links and randomly split into training, validation and test sets according to a 3 : 1 : 1 ratio. All the non-existing links for each user (both  X  old  X  and  X  new  X  users) are used as the neg-ative links (compared with the existing links). The positive training set together with all the negative link set are used to build the model. Parameters of the MART algorithm, such as tree depth, tree number and iteration numbers, etc., are selected with the validation set. The built model will be applied to the test set, the results of which are used in our comparison.
To evaluate the e  X  ectiveness of the proposed techniques in recommending social links for users in enterprise social networks, we compare our techniques with several represen-tative baseline methods, including both supervised and un-supervised methods proposed in existing works for link pre-diction in external social networks [31]. Now, we summarize all the comparison methods as follows:
We are not able to reveal the actual numbers here and throughout the paper for commercial reasons.
We use the widely-accepted Normalized Discounted Cu-mulative Gain (NDCG) [16] to compare di  X  erent methods. NDCG is a common evaluation metric to measure the perfor-mance of ranking methods. NDCG@1, NDCG@2, NDCG@3, NDCG@4 are used in our experiments, since the accuracy of top results is more important in a recommendation scenario like this.
The comparison results are given in Figure 3, where Sub-figures 3(a)-3(d) show the performance of all the compari-son methods measured respectively by NDCG@1, NDCG@2, NDCG@3, and NDCG@4.

According to the results shown in Figure 3, SENSOR which utilizes information from both enterprise social net-work and the organizational chart performs the best among all the comparison methods across all metrics. First, SEN-SOR achieves NDCG scores higher than SENSOR-n by 16.8%, and SENSOR-c by 13.7% at di  X  erent ranking po-sitions 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Recall that SENSOR-n only uses information from ESN. This suggests that incor-porating information from organizational chart can improve the link recommendation results significantly. Meanwhile, SENSOR-c recommends social links merely based on infor-mation in organizational chart. This shows that social links are still di  X  erent from those professional and business links implied by the organizational chart, and organizational chart alone is not enough. Furthermore, SENSOR performs much better than SCAN , which uses the same feature set but is using a point-wise learning algorithm instead. Possible reasons are (1) SCAN is a point-wise prediction algorithm, which has been shown less e  X  ective than pairwise prediction algorithm like MART [7] for ranking; and (2) SCAN su  X  ers from class imbalance problem, while in real world applica-tions like in our case, there tend to always be much more negative labels than positive labels. In addition, SENSOR can also achieve dramatically better performance than tra-ditional unsupervised link prediction methods CN, JC and AA.
Di  X  erent dimensions of features have been extracted from the network, e.g., user a nity, user personal preference, and the quality of user-generated content. To investigate the e  X  ectiveness of di  X  erent kinds of features, we also do a fea-ture ablation analysis. We remove one category of features while keeping all other categories each time, and the results achieved are given in Table 1.

First, we check the user a nity features. By compar-ing the results achieved by SENSOR with features  X  All  X , and  X  All -a nity features  X  (including  X  All -social a n-ity  X ,  X  All -org a nity  X ,  X  All -hybrid a nity  X  and  X  All -geo a nity  X ), we observe that, as expected, by using  X  All  X  the features, SENSOR performs the best. When excluding the  X  social a nity  X ,  X  org a nity  X  and  X  hybrid a nity  X  fea-tures, the performance of SENSOR will degrade a lot. For example, with  X  All  X  features, SENSOR can achieve 0 . 611 NDCG@1 but when excluding  X  social a nity  X ,  X  org a n-ity  X  X nd X  hybrid a nity  X  X eatures, the performance will drop 38 . 9%, 10 . 3% and 4 . 1% respectively. This suggests that the user a nity implied by social networks and organizational chart are both useful, and, what is more, they complement to each other. However, when excluding the  X  geo-a nity  X  features, the performance of SENSOR does not decrease much. This shows that enterprise social connections are not closely related to users X  geographical locations. Second, we look into the  X  user characteristics  X  features. As shown in Table 1, when excluding the user character-istics features, SENSOR  X  X  performance will degrade a lot. For example, Its NDCG@1 is 24 . 5% lower than that achieved by SENSOR with  X  All  X  features. This confirms that users in enterprise social networks do have di  X  erent personal pref-erences, which significantly influences their decisions of who to connect with in company.

Third, we examine the features based on user-generated content. When excluding this set of features, SENSOR per-forms almost the same as when using  X  X ll X  features, which shows that user generated content does not help recommend social links in enterprise social networks. One possible rea-son is that the links in ESN are mostly social links rather than content-based links: a user may not always follow an-other user who has published high-quality content.
It has been shown that new users often su  X  er from the cold start problem, since we do not have data for new users [25]. Does the cold start problem also exist in enterprise social link recommendation? In Figure 4, we give the recommen-dation results of SENSOR and SENSOR-n (which does not use the organizational chart) in recommending social links for  X  new  X  users and  X  old  X  users. The x axis of the figure de-notes the number of existing links users have and users with zero existing links are  X  new  X  users while users with existing links represent X  old  X  X sers. First of all, we see that SENSOR performs better than SENSOR-n consistently for users with di  X  erent numbers of existing following links. This confirms again that the organizational chart helps link recommenda-tion. Specifically, for users with fewer existing links, SEN-SOR performs even better than SENSOR-n , which suggests that the organizational chart information is more impor-tant in recommending links for  X  new  X  users. As users be-come  X  X ld X  and have more existing links, the advantages of SENSOR over SENSOR-n will decrease steadily. In other words, for  X  old  X  users who have already had much informa-tion in the enterprise social network, organizational chart may not help much.
One possible reason is that  X  X ew X  users tend to first con-nect with employees in the same group or department, and then connect with friends beyond the organizational bound-aries. This would also lead the link recommendation prob-lem for  X  X ew X  users to be relatively easier than for  X  X ld X  users. This has also been confirmed by the results in Figure 4, which shows that we can even achieve higher NDCG for new users. In summary, there is no  X  X old start X  (but a  X  X ot start X  instead) for new users in enterprise social link recom-mendation, thanks to the knowledge from the organizational chart.
We summarize some interesting findings we have observed:
Enterprise social networks [34] can help employees in com-panies get reliable information [30, 6, 12]. Yarosh et al. [30] explore the importance of di  X  erent types of informa-tion in expert searching based on a small-sized questionnaire dataset and useful information is used to improve the use-fulness of supporting systems. Ehrlich et al. [6] propose to search for experts in enterprise with both text and so-cial network analysis techniques. They propose to examine the users X  dynamic profile information and get the social distance to the expert before deciding how to initiate the contact. Meanwhile, Enterprise social networks can lead to other benefits to companies and DiMicco et al. [5] study the motivations for social networking at work. Users in enter-prise social networks will connect and learn from each other through personal and professional sharing. DiMicco et al. [4] propose to study people sensemaking and relation building on an enterprise social network site. Based on the hetero-geneous information in enterprise social networks, Zhang et Figure 4: Link recommendation for new users and old users al. propose to infer the complete organizational chart based on an unsupervised learning framework CREATE in [34].
Social connections among users in enterprise social net-works usually have multiple facets. Wu et al. [28] study the multiplexity of social connections among users in enter-prise social networks, which include both professional and personal closeness. Zhang et al. [32] give a case study about the early adoption and use of micro-blogging in 500 compa-nies, and attempt to understand how knowledge workers are likely to use micro-bolgging in the enterprise. Hsieh et al. [15] study the problem of computing edge a nity between two users on a social network. Some friend recommendation works have been done either on small-sized enterprise social networks, like Beehive [2], or survey based dataset [11, 2, 10, 9]. Chen et al. [2] study people recommendations designed to help users find known, o  X  ine contacts and discover new friends on social networking sites. They evaluated four rec-ommender algorithms in an enterprise social networking site using a personalized survey of 500 users and a field study of 3,000 users. Guy et al. explore the personalized recommen-dation of social software items [11], close friends [9] and even strangers [10] based on user studies involving less than 500 users in enterprises. Di  X  erent from these works, we are doing link recommendation using a real-world large-scale ESN. Link prediction in online social networks first proposed by Liben-Nowell et al. [21] has become an important research topic in recent years. In [21], Liben-Nowell et al. propose various unsupervised link predictors to calculate the exis-tence scores of potential links. Meanwhile, Hasan et al. [13] propose a supervised learning framework to predict potential links in online social networks. These works are all based on one single homogeneous networks. Sun et al. [26] propose a meta path based prediction model to predict co-author relationships in the heterogeneous bibliographic network.
Nowadays, link prediction in multiple heterogeneous so-cial networks simultaneously has attracted much attention. Kong et al. [18] notice that users nowadays are usually in-volved in multiple social networks at the same time to enjoy specific social services provided by di  X  erent networks. Zhang et al. [35] study the social link recommendations in multiple partially aligned social networks simultaneously.
In this paper, we study a new problem of enterprise so-cial link recommendation. To understand and model whom an employee wants to connect with in the company, new techniques are introduced to explore both enterprise social network and organizational chart from three dimensions: (1) user-user a nity, (2) user characteristics, and (3) user gen-erated content. A supervised machine-learned recommenda-tion algorithm, SENSOR , is developed. Evaluation using a real-world large-scale enterprise social network shows that the proposed techniques perform e  X  ectively in recommend-ing social links for enterprise social networks.
 We plan to further investigate the relationship between ESN and organizational chart. To name a few, e.g., orga-nizational chart inference based on ESN as well as hybrid information di  X  usion across ESN and organizational chart, will be studied in the future.
