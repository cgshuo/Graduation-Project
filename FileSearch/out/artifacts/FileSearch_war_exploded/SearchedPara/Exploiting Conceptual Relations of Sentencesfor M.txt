 Multi-document summarization is to produce a summary from a set of docu-ments which describe the same topic, and a variety of document summarization methods have been developed recently [ 1 , 2 ]. As documents and concepts have the same characteristic that focus on an issue, documents are the reflection of concepts to some extent. However, existing methods do not or implicitly reflect the conceptual relation of sentences, while we explicitly construct the relation between sentences and concepts, which better reflect the relations of sentences in the concept degree. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Multi-document Summarization based on Explicit Semantics of Sentences (MDSES). The contributions of our work are summarized as follows: 1) We explicitly con-sider the conceptual relations of sentences in the task of multi-document sum-marization. 2) We propose a novel method called MDSES which utilizes explicit semantics of sentences. 3) We exploit sentence-concept semantic relation and concept-concept semantic relation which is based on Wikipedia textual content and hyperlink structure to eliminate redundancy. 4) Experimental results on the DUC dataset verify the effectiveness of MDSES compared with baselines. MDSES is composed of three components: sentence-concept graph generation, concept clustering and summary generation. First, we parse C relation M sc . We exploit M sc to construct sentence-concept graph Then we run graph weighting algorithm on G to get ranked weighted sentence set S and concept set C . Since similar sentences map to similar concepts, we need cluster concepts to detect redundancy. First, we compute concept-concept rela-tion M cc based on Wikipedia hyperlink structure. Then we clustering concepts based on M cc to concept clusters CC . At last we conduct summary generation to generate summary. Fig. 1 presents the overall framework of MDSES. Sentence-Concept Graph Construction: We use Explicit Semantic Anal-ysis (ESA) [ 3 ] to mapping sentences to Wikipedia concepts. First, we build an inverted index of Wikipedia, which maps each term into a list of concepts in which it appears. We define s i = { t 1 ,t 2 , ..., t n v = { v k = { k the strength of association of term t i with Wikipedia concept Then, the weight w ij between s i and c j is defined as t mapping procedure, we can get a sentence-concept relation represented by Then we use S and C as vertex, M sc as the weighted edge E concept graph G = { S, C, E } . Define weight ( s ) as the weight of as the weight of c , and we initialize each s in S we calculate the weight of c i and s j iteratively as follows: guarantee the convergence of the iterative, the weight of vertex is normalized after each iteration. We iterate the procedure until it reaches convergence, and we can get ranked weighted sentence set S and ranked weighted concept set Concept Clustering: In order to get concept-concept relation Wikipedia Link Vector based Measure (WLVM) [ 4 ]. For each concept, we build a vector space model, which using link counts weighted by the probability of each link occurring. This probability is defined by the total number of links to the target concept over the total number of concepts. Thus if of concepts within Wikipedia, then the weighted value w for the link is the source concept and b is the target concept) is defined as b | X  log ( t x the links contained in concepts c 1 and c 2 . The vector for each concept by  X   X  c i = { w ( c i  X  l 1 ) ,w ( c i  X  l 2 ) , ..., w ( c i  X  l the concepts is then given by the cosine similarity between their vectors. After we compute the similarity between concepts, we can obtain clustering, we use the conventional Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm to cluster concepts based on M cc and get concept clusters { cc ,cc value in our study).
 Summary Generation: First, we rank CC based on the ranked weighted For each cluster cc , we compute its weight weight ( cc )= we rank concept clusters in descending order of weight to get ranked concept clusters CC . For each cluster, we select one concept c with the highest weight to represent the cluster based on the ranked C , and we can get representative from
RC , and get sentence set S c linked to c based on G , then we select the sentence with the highest weight in S c based on S to generate summary. Iterate the procedure until the length of summary is reached. In our experiments, we use DUC 1 2004 dataset and ROUGE [ 5 ] as evaluation metric. For baselines, we choose MMR-MD [ 6 ] and TextRank [ 1 ] for they are two classical methods. With the ubiquity of mobile internet and people X  X  reading habit on mobile devices, different length of summaries are also important. We investigate the performances of MDSES under different summary length, which ranging from 60 words to 100 words. For evaluation, we use ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-SU4, and Fig. 2 are comparison at different summary length. From Fig. 2 we have three obvious: (1)All the curves are incremental curves and the reason is also obvious. It is because that with the length of summary increases, the summary will contain more important information. (3)The gradi-ent of MDSES is higher than TextRank and MMR-MD, which means that our MDSES tends to have more advantages when the length of summary increases. With the summary length increases, TextRank and MMR-MD select redundancy sentences to summary while MDSES selects sentences in concept degree which leading to more coverage of summary. (3)TextRank outperforms MDSES in Fig. 2(b) when the summary length is less than 80 words. The reason may be that the summary length is too small, the importance of conceptual relations of sen-tences is restricted. But while the summary length is appropriate or big, the good effect of exploiting conceptual relations of sentences for multi-document summarization appears. In this paper we propose a novel method MDSES, it contains three components: sentence-concept graph construction, concept clustering and summary genera-tion. Unlike with other methods, we explicitly construct the relation between sentences and concepts, which better reflect the relations of sentences in the concept degree. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of MDSES.
