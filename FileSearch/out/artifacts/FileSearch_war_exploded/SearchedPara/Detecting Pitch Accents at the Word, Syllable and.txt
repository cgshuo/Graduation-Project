 Prosody in a language like Standard American En-glish can be used by speakers to convey semantic, pragmatic and paralinguistic information. Words are made intonationall prominent, or accented to convey information such as contrast, focus, topic, and in-formation status. The communicative implications of accenting influence the interpretation of a word or phrase. However, the acoustic excursions associ-ated with accent are typically aligned with the lex-ically stressed syllable of the accented word. This disparity between the domains of acoustic proper-ties and communicative impact has led to different approaches to pitch accent detection, and to the use of different domains of analysis.

In this paper, we compare automatic pitch accent detection at the vowel, syllable, and word level to determine which approach is optimal. While lex-ical and syntactic information has been shown to contribute to the detection of pitch accent, we only explore acoustic features. This decision allows us to closely examine the indicators of accent that are present in the speech signal in isolation from lin-guistic effects that may indicate that a word or syl-lable may be accented. The choice of domain for automatic pitch accent prediction it also related to how that prediction is to be used and impacts how it can be evaluated in comparison with other re-search efforts. While some downstream spoken lan-guage processing tasks benefit by knowing which syllable in a word is accented, such as clarifica-tion of communication misunderstandings, such as  X  X  said un lock the door  X  not lock it! X , most appli-cations care only about which word is intonation-ally prominent. For the identification of contrast, given/new status, or focus, only word-level informa-tion is required. While the performance of nucleus-or syllable-based predictions can be translated to word predictions, such a translation is rarely per-formed, making it difficult to compare performance and thus determine which approach is best.

In this paper, we describe experiments in pitch ac-cent detection comparing the use of vowel nuclei, syllables and words as units of analysis. In Section 2, we discuss related work. We describe the ma-terials in Section 3, the experiments themselves in Section 4 and conclude in Section 5. Acoustic-based approaches to pitch accent detection have explored prediction at the word, syllable, and vowel level, but have rarely compared prediction accuracies across these different domains. An ex-ception is the work of Ross and Ostendorf (1996), who detect accent on the Boston University Radio News Corpus (BURNC) at both the syllable and word level. Using CART predictions as input to an HMM, they detect pitch accents on syllables spoken by a single speaker from BURNC with 87.7% accu-racy, corresponding to 82.5% word-based accuracy, using both lexical and acoustic features. In compar-ing the discriminative usefulness of syllables vs. syl-lable nuclei for accent detection, Tamburini (2003) finds syllable nuclei (vowel) duration to be as useful to full syllables. Rosenberg and Hirschberg (2007) used an energy-based ensemble technique to detect pitch accents with 84.1% accuracy on the read por-tion of the Boston Directions Corpus, without us-ing lexical information. Sridhar et al. (2008) ob-tain 86.0% word-based accuracy using maximum entropy models from acoustic and syntactic infor-mation on the BURNC. Syllable-based detection by Ananthakrishnan and Narayanan (2008) com-bines acoustic, lexical and syntactic FSM models to achieve a detection rate of 86.75%. Similar suprasegmental features have also been explored in work at SRI/ICSI which employs a hidden event model to model intonational information for a va-riety of tasks including punctuation and disfluency detection (Baron et al., 2002). However, while progress has been made in accent detection perfor-mance in the past 15 years, with both word and syl-lable accuracy at about 86%, these accuracies have been achieved with different methods and some have included lexico-syntactic as well as acoustic fea-tures. It is still not clear which domain of acoustic analysis provides the most accurate cues for accent prediction. To address this issue, our work compares accent detection at the syllable nucleus, full syllable, and word levels, using a common modeling tech-nique and a common corpus, to focus on the ques-tion of which domain of acoustic analysis is most useful for pitch accent prediction. Our experiments use 157.9 minutes (29,578 words) from six speakers in the BURNC (Ostendorf et al., 1995) recordings of professionally read radio news. This corpus has been prosodically annotated with full ToBI labeling (Silverman et al., 1992), includ-ing the presence and type of accents; these are an-notated at the syllable level and 54.7% (16,178) of words are accented. Time-aligned phone boundaries generated by forced alignment are used to identify vowel regions for analysis. There are 48,359 vow-els in the corpus and 34.8 of these are accented. To generate time-aligned syllable boundaries, we align the forced-aligned phones with a syllabified lexicon included with the corpus.

The use of BURNC for comparative accent pre-diction in our three domains is not straightforward, due to anomalies in the corpus. First, the lexicon and forced-alignment output in BURNC use distinct phonetic inventories; to align these, we have em-ployed a minimum edit distance procedure where aligning any two vowels incurs zero cost. This guar-antees that, at a minimum the vowels will be aligned correctly. Also, the number of syllables per word in the lexicon does not always match the number of vowels in the forced alignment. This leads to 114 syllables containing two forced-aligned vowels, and 8 containing none. Instead of performing post hoc correction of the syllabification results, we in-clude all of the automatically identified syllables in the data set. This syllabification approach generates 48,253 syllables, 16,781 (34.8%) bearing accent. We train logistic regression models to detect the presence of pitch accent using acoustic features drawn from each word, syllable and vowel, using Weka (Witten et al., 1999). The features we use in-cluded pitch (f0), energy and duration, which have been shown to correlate with pitch accent in En-glish. To model these, we calculate pitch and en-ergy contours for each token using Praat (Boersma, 2001). Duration information is derived using the vowel, syllable or word segmentation described in Section 3. The feature vectors we construct include features derived from both raw and speaker z-score normalized 1 pitch and energy contours. The feature vector used in all three analysis scenarios is com-prised of minimum, maximum, mean, standard de-viation and the z-score of the maximum of these raw and normalized acoustic contours. The duration of the region in seconds is also included.

The results of ten-fold cross validation classifica-tion experiments are shown in Table 1. Note that, when running ten-fold cross validation on syllables and vowels, we divide the folds by words, so that each syllable within a word is a member of the same fold. To allow for direct comparison of the three approaches, we generate word-based results from vowel-and syllable-based experiments. If any syllable or vowel in a word is hypothesized as ac-cented, the containing word is predicted to be ac-cented. Vowel/syllable accuracies should be higher than word-based accuracies since the baseline is sig-nificantly higher. However, we find that the F-measure for detecting accent is consistently higher for word-based results. A prediction of accented on any component syllable is sufficient to generate a correct word prediction.

Our results suggest, first of all, that there is dis-criminative information beyond the syllable nucleus. Syllable-based classification is significantly better than vowel-based classification, whether we com-pare accuracy or F-measure. It is possible that the narrow region of analysis offered by syllable and vowel-based analysis makes the aggregated features more susceptible to the effects of noise. Moreover, errors in the forced-alignment phone boundaries and syllabification may negatively impact the per-formance of vowel-and syllable-based approaches. Until automatic phone alignment improves, word-based prediction appears to be more reliable. An automatic, acoustic syllable-nucleus detection ap-proach may be able generate more discriminative re-gions of analysis for pitch accent detection than the forced-alignment and lexicon alignment technique used here. This remains an area for future study.
However, if we accept that the feature represen-tations accurately model the acoustic information contained in the regions of analysis and that the BURNC annotation is accurate, the most likely ex-planation for the superiority of word-based predic-tion over syllable-or vowel-based strategiesis is that the acoustic excursions correlated with accent occur outside a word X  X  lexically stressed syllable. In par-ticular, complex pitch accents in English are gener-ally realized on multiple syllables. To examine this possibility, we looked at the distribution of misses from the three classification scenarios. The distribu-tion of pitch accent types of missed detections using evaluation of the three scenarios is shown in Table 2. In the ToBI framework, the complex pitch ac-cents include L+H*, L*+H, H+!H* and their down-stepped variants. As we suspected, larger units of analysis lead to improved performance on complex ror distributions yields a  X  2 of 42.108, p &lt; 0 . 0001 .
Since accenting is the perception of a word as more prominent than surrounding words, features that incorporate local contextual acoustic informa-tion should improve detection accuracy at all lev-els. To represent surrounding acoustic context in feature vectors, we calculate the z-score of the max-imum and mean pitch and energy over six regions. Three of these are  X  X hort range X  regions: one pre-vious region, one following region, and both the previous and following region. The other three are  X  X ong range X  regions. For words, these regions are defined as two previous words, two following words, and both two previous and two following words. To give syllable-and vowel-based classifi-cation scenarios access to a comparable amount of acoustic context, the  X  X ong range X  regions covered ranges of three syllables or vowels. There are ap-proximately 1.63 syllables/vowels per word in the BURNC corpus; thus, on balance, a window of two words is equivalent to one of three syllables. Du-ration is also normalized relative to the duration of regions within the contextual regions. Accuracy and f-measure results from ten-fold cross validation ex-periments are shown in Table 3. We find dramatic increases in the performance of vowel-and syllable-based performance when we include contextual fea-tures. Vowel-based classification shows nearly 10% absolute increase accuracy when translated to the word level. The improvements in word-based clas-sification, however, are less dramatic. It may be that word-based analysis already incorporates much the contextual information that is helpful for detect-ing pitch accents. The feature representations in each of these three experiments include a compara-ble amount of acoustic context. This suggests that the superiority of word-based detection is not sim-ply due to the access to more contextual informa-tion, but rather that there is discriminative informa-tion outside the accent-bearing syllable. In this paper, we describe experiments comparing the detection of pitch accents on three acoustic do-mains  X  words, syllables and vowels  X  using acous-tic features alone. To permit direct comparison be-tween accent prediction in these three domains of analysis, we generate word-, syllable-, and vowel-based results directly, and then transfer syllable-and nucleus-based predictions to word predictions.
Our experiments show that word-based accent detection significantly outperforms syllable-and vowel-based approaches. Extracting features that incorporate acoustic information from surrounding context improves performance in all three domains. We find that there is, in fact, acoustic information discriminative to pitch accent that is found within accented words, outside the accent-bearing sylla-ble. We achieve 84.2% word-based accuracy  X  significantly below the 86.0% reported by Sridhar et al. (2008) using syntactic and acoustic compo-nents. However, our experiments use only acoustic features, since we are concerned with comparing do-mains of acoustic analysis within the larger task of accent identification. Our 84.2% accuracy is signifi-cantly higher than the 80.09% accuracy obtained by the 10ms frame-based acoustic modeling described in (Sridhar et al., 2008). Our aggregations of pitch and energy contours over a region of analysis appear to be more helpful than short frame modeling.
In future work, we will explore a number of tech-niques to transfer word based predictions to sylla-bles. This will allow us to compare word-based de-tection to published syllable-based results. Prelimi-nary results suggest that word-based detection is su-perior regardless of the domain of evaluation.
