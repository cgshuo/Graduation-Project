 There has recently been a rapid growth in the num-ber of community question answering (CQA) ser-vices such as Yahoo! Answers 1 , Askville 2 and WikiAnswer 3 where people answer questions post-ed by other users. These CQA services have built up very large archives of questions and their answers. They provide a valuable resource for question an-swering research. Table 1 is an example from Ya-hoo! Answers web site. In the CQA archives, the title part is the user X  X  query question, and the user X  X  information need is usually expressed as natural lan-guage statements mixed with questions expressing their interests in the question body part.

In order to avoid the lag time involved with wait-ing for a personal response and to enable high quali-ty answers from the archives to be retrieved, we need to search CQA archives of previous questions that are closely associated with answers. If a question is found to be interesting to the user, then a previ-ous answer can be provided with very little delay. Question search and question recommendation are proposed to facilitate finding highly relevant or po-tentially interesting questions. Given a user X  X  ques-tion as the query, question search tries to return the most semantically similar questions from the question archives. As the complement of question search, we define question recommendation as rec-ommending questions whose information need is the same or similar to the user X  X  original question. For example, the question  X  What aspects of my com-puter do I need to upgrade ...  X  with the informa-tion need  X  ... making a skate movie, my computer freezes, ...  X  and the question  X  What is the most cost effective way to expend memory space ...  X  with in-formation need  X  ... in need of more space for mu-sic and pictures ...  X  are both good recommendation questions for the user in Table 1. So the recommend-ed questions are not necessarily identical or similar to the query question.

In this paper, we discuss methods for question recommendation based on using the similarity be-tween information need in the archive. We also propose two models to predict the information need based on the query question even if there X  X  no infor-mation need expressed in the body of the question. We show that with the proposed models it is possi-ble to recommend questions that have the same or similar information need.

The remainder of the paper is structured as fol-lows. In section 2, we briefly describe the related work on question search and recommendation. Sec-tion 3 addresses in detail how we measure the sim-ilarity between short texts. Section 4 describes two models for information need prediction that we use for the experiment. Section 5 tests the performance of the proposed models for the task of question rec-ommendation. Section 7 is the conclusion of this paper. 2.1 Question Search Burke et al. (1997) combined a lexical metric and a simple semantic knowledge-based (WordNet) simi-larity method to retrieve semantically similar ques-tions from frequently asked question (FAQ) data. Jeon et al. (2005a) retrieved semantically similar questions from Korean CQA data by calculating the similarity between their answers. The assumption behind their research is that questions with very sim-ilar answers tend to be semantically similar. Jeon et al. (2005b) also discussed methods for grouping similar questions based on using the similarity be-tween answers in the archive. These grouped ques-tion pairs were further used as training data to es-timate probabilities for a translation-based question retrieval model. Wang et al. (2009) proposed a tree kernel framework to find similar questions in the C-QA archive based on syntactic tree structures. Wang et al. (2010) mined lexical and syntactic features to detect question sentences in CQA data. 2.2 Question Recommendation Wu et al. (2008) presented an incremental auto-matic question recommendation framework based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis. Question recommendation in their work considered both the users X  interests and feedback. Duan et al. (2008) made use of a tree-cut model to represent question-s as graphs of topic terms. Questions were recom-mended based on this topic graph. The recommend-ed questions can provide different aspects around the topic of the query question.

The above question search and recommendation research provide different ways to retrieve question-s from large archives of question answering data. However, none of them considers the similarity or diversity between questions by exploring their infor-mation needs. In question retrieval systems accurate similarity measures between documents are crucial. Most tra-ditional techniques for measuring the similarity be-tween two documents mainly focus on comparing word co-occurrences. The methods employing this strategy for documents can usually achieve good re-sults, because they may share more common words than short text snippets. However the state-of-the-art techniques usually fail to achieve desired results due to short questions and information need texts.
In order to measure the similarity between short texts, we make use of three kinds of text similari-ty measures: TFIDF based, Knowledge based and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based similarity measures in this paper. We will compare their per-formance for the task of question recommendation in the experiment section. 3.1 TFIDF Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto (1999) provides a T-FIDF method to calculate the similarity between two texts. Each document is represented by a term vec-tor using TFIDF score. The similarity between two text D i and D j is the cosine similarity in the vector space model:
This method is used in most information retrieval systems as it is both efficient and effective. Howev-er if the query text contains only one or two words this method will be biased to shorter answer texts (Jeon et al., 2005a). We also found that in CQA data short contents in the question body cannot provide any information about the users X  information needs. Based on the above two reasons, in the test data sets we do not include the questions whose information need parts contain only a few noninformative words . 3.2 Knowledge-based Measure Mihalcea et al. (2006) proposed several knowledge-based methods for measuring the semantic level sim-ilarity of texts to solve the lexical chasm problem be-tween short texts. These knowledge-based similarity measures were derived from word semantic similar-ity by making use of WordNet. The evaluation on a paraphrase recognition task showed that knowledge-based measures outperform the simpler lexical level approach.

We follow the definition in (Mihalcea et al., 2006) to derive a text-to-text similarity metric mcs for two given texts D i and D j : mcs ( D i ,D j ) =
For each word w in D i , maxSim ( w,D j ) com-putes the maximum semantic similarity between w and any word in D j . In this paper we choose lin (Lin, 1998) and jcn (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) to compute the word-to-word semantic similarity.
We only choose nouns and verbs for calculating mcs . Additionally, when w is a noun we restrict the words in document D i (and D j ) to just nouns. Similarly, when w is a verb, we restrict the words in document D i (and D j ) to just verbs. 3.3 Probabilistic Topic Model Celikyilmaz et al. (2010) presented probabilistic topic model based methods to measure the similar-ity between question and candidate answers. The candidate answers were ranked based on the hidden topics discovered by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (L-DA) methods.

In contrast to the TFIDF method which measures  X  X ommon words X , short texts are not compared to each other directly in probabilistic topic models. In-stead, the texts are compared using some  X  X hird-party X  topics that relate to them. A passage D in the retrieved documents (document collection) is repre-sented as a mixture of fixed topics, with topic z get-ting weight  X  ( D ) z in passage D and each topic is a distribution over a finite vocabulary of words, with word w having a probability  X  ( z ) w in topic z . Gibbs Sampling can be used to estimate the corresponding expected posterior probabilities P ( z | D ) =  X   X  ( D ) z P ( w | z ) =  X   X  ( z ) w (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).
In this paper we use two LDA based similarity measures in (Celikyilmaz et al., 2010) to measure the similarity between short information need texts. The first LDA similarity method uses KL divergence to measure the similarity between two documents under each given topic: tween two documents under topic z = k using KL divergence measure. D ( z = k ) i is the probability distri-bution of words in document D i given a fixed topic z .

The second LDA similarity measure from (Grif-fiths and Steyvers, 2004) treats each document as a probability distribution of topics: where  X   X  ( D i ) is document D i  X  X  probability distribu-tion of topics as defined earlier. There are two reasons that we need to predict in-formation need. It is often the case that the query question does not have a question body part. So we need a model to predict the information need part based on the query question in order to recommend questions based on the similarity of their informa-tion needs. Another reason is that information need prediction plays a crucial part not only in Question Answering but also in information retrieval (Liu et al., 2008). In this paper we propose an information need prediction method based on a statistical ma-chine translation model. 4.1 Statistical Machine Translation Model ( f sentence pair ( f , e ), source language String, f = f f 2 ...f J has J words, and e = e 1 e 2 ...e I has I word-s. And alignment a = a 1 a 2 ...a J represents the map-ping information from source language words to tar-get words.
 Statistical machine translation models estimate Pr ( f | e ) , the translation probability from source lan-guage string e to target language string f (Och et al., 2003):
EM-algorithm is usually used to train the align-ment models to estimate lexicon parameters p ( f | e ) .
In E-step, the counts for one sentence pair ( f , e ) are: c ( f | e ; f , e ) = X In the M-step, lexicon parameters become: Different alignment models such as IBM-1 to IBM-5 (Brown et al., 1993) and HMM model (Och and Ney, 2000) provide different decompositions of Pr ( f , a | e ) . For different alignment models differ-ent approaches were proposed to estimate the cor-responding alignments and parameters. The detail-s can be found in (Och et al., 2003; Brown et al., 1993). 4.2 Information Need Prediction After estimating the statistical translation probabili-ties, we treat the information need prediction as the process of ranking words by p ( w | Q ) , the probability of generating word w from question Q : P ( w | Q ) =  X  X The word-to-word translation probability P tr ( w | t ) is the probability of word w is translated from a word t in question Q using the translation model. The above formula uses linear interpolation smoothing of the document model with the back-ground language model P ( t | C ) .  X  is the smoothing parameter. P ( t | Q ) and P ( t | C ) are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimator.

One important consideration is that statistical ma-chine translation models first estimate Pr ( f | e ) and then calculate Pr ( e | f ) using Bayes X  theorem to min-imize ordering errors (Brown et al., 1993): But in this paper, we skip this step as we found out the order of words in information need part is not an important factor. In our collected CQA archive, question title and information need pairs can be con-sidered as a type of parallel corpus, which is used for estimating word-to-word translation probabili-ties. More specifically, we estimated the IBM-4 model by GIZA++ 4 with the question part as the source language and information need part as the tar-get language. 5.1 Text Preprocessing The questions posted on community QA sites often contain spelling or grammar errors. These errors in-fluence the calculation of similarity and the perfor-mance of information retrieval (Zhao et al., 2007; Bunescu and Huang, 2010). In this paper, we use an open source software afterthedeadline 5 to auto-matically correct the spelling errors in the question and information need texts first. We also made use of Web 1T 5-gram 6 to implement an N-Gram based method (Cheng et al., 2008) to further filter out the false positive corrections and re-rank correction sug-gestions (Mudge, 2010). The texts are tagged by Brill X  X  Part-of-Speech Tagger 7 as the rule-based tag-ger is more robust than the state-of-art statistical tag-gers for raw web contents. This tagging informa-tion is only used for WordNet similarity calculation. Stop word removal and lemmatization are applied to the all the raw texts before feeding into machine translation model training, the LDA model estimat-ing and similarity calculation. 5.2 Construction of Training and Testing Sets We made use of the questions crawled from Yahoo! Answers for the estimating models and evaluation. More specifically, we obtained 2 million questions under two categories at Yahoo! Answers:  X  X ravel X  (1 million), and  X  X omputers&amp;internet X  (1 million). Depending on whether the best answers have been chosen by the asker, questions from Yahoo! answers can be divided into  X  X esolved X  and  X  X nresolved X  cat-egories. From each of the above two categories, we randomly selected 200 resolved questions to con-struct two testing data sets:  X  X est t X  ( X  X ravel X ), and  X  X est c X  ( X  X omputers&amp;internet X ). In order to mea-sure the information need similarity in our experi-ment we selected only those questions whose infor-mation needs part contained at least 3 informative words after stop word removal. The rest of the ques-tions  X  X rain t X  and  X  X rain c X  under the two categories are left for estimating the LDA topic models and the translation models. We will show how we obtain these models later. 5.3 Experimental Setup For each question (query question) in  X  X est t X  or  X  X est c X , we used the words in the question title part as the main search query and the other words in the information need part as search query expansion to retrieve candidate recommended questions from Ya-hoo! Answers website. We obtained an average of 154 resolved questions under  X  X ravel X  or  X  X omputer-s&amp;internet X  category, and three assessors were in-volved in the manual judgments.

Given a question returned by a recommendation method, two assessors are asked to label it with  X  X ood X  or  X  X ad X . The third assessor will judge the conflicts. The assessors are also asked to read the in-formation need and answer parts. If a recommended question is considered to express the same or similar information need, the assessor will label it  X  X ood X ; otherwise, the assessor will label it as  X  X ad X .
Three measures for evaluating the recommenda-tion performance are utilized. They are Mean Re-ciprocal Rank (MRR), top five prediction accura-cy (precision@5) and top ten prediction accuracies (precision@10) (Voorhees and Tice, 2004; Cao et al., 2008). In MRR the reciprocal rank of a query question is the multiplicative inverse of the rank of the first  X  X ood X  recommended question. The top five prediction accuracy for a query question is the num-ber of  X  X ood X  recommended questions out of the top five ranked questions and the top ten accuracy is cal-culated out of the top ten ranked questions. 5.4 Similarity Measure The first experiment conducted question recommen-dation based on their information need parts. Dif-ferent text similarity methods described in section 3 were used to measure the similarity between the information need texts. In TFIDF similarity mea-sure (TFIDF), the idf values for each word were computed from frequency counts over the entire Aquaint corpus 8 . For calculating the word-to-word knowledge-based similarity, a WordNet::Similarity Java implementation 9 of the similarity measures lin (Knowledge2) and jcn (Knowledge1) is used in this paper. For calculating topic model based similarity, we estimated two LDA models from  X  X rain t X  and  X  X rain c X  using GibbsLDA++ 10 . We treated each question including the question title and the infor-mation need part as a single document of a sequence of words. These documents were preprocessed be-fore being fed into LDA model. 1800 iterations for Gibbs sampling 200 topics parameters were set for each LDA model estimation.

The results in table 2 show that TFIDF and LDA1 methods perform better for recommending questions than the others. After further analysis of the ques-tions recommended by both methods, we discov-ered that the ordering of the recommended questions from TFIDF and LDA1 are quite different. TFIDF similarity method prefers texts with more common words, while the LDA1 method can find the rela-tion between the non-common words between short texts based on a series of third-party topics. The L-DA1 method outperforms the TFIDF method in two ways: (1) the top recommended questions X  informa-tion needs share less common words with the query question X  X ; (2) the top recommended questions span wider topics. The questions highly recommended by LDA1 can suggest more useful topics to the user.
Knowledge-based methods are also shown to per-form worse than TFIDF and LDA1. We found that some words were mis-tagged so that they were not included in the word-to-word similarity calculation. Another reason for the worse performance is that the words out of the WordNet dictionary were also not included in the similarity calculation.
 The Mean Reciprocal Rank score for TFIDF and LDA1 are more than 80% . That is to say, we are able to recommend questions to the users by measuring their information needs. The first two recommended questions for Q1 and Q2 using LDA1 method are shown in table 4. InfoN is the information need part associated with each question.

In the preprocessing step, some words were suc-cessfully corrected such as  X  What should I do this saturday? ... and staying in a hotell ...  X  and  X  my faimly is traveling to florda ...  X . However, there are still a small number of texts such as  X  How come my Gforce visualization doesn X  X  work?  X  and  X  Do i need an Id to travel from new york to maimi ?  X  failed to be corrected. So in the future, a better method is expected to correct these failure cases. 5.5 Information Need Prediction There are some retrieved questions whose informa-tion need parts are empty or become empty or al-most empty (one or two words left) after the prepro-cessing step. The average number of such retrieved questions for each query question is 10 in our exper-iment. The similarity ranking scores of these ques-tions are quite low or zero in the previous experi-ment. In this experiment, we will apply information need prediction to the questions whose information needs are missing in order to find out whether we improve the recommendation task.

The question and information need pairs in both  X  X rain t X  and  X  X rain c X  training sets were used to train two IBM-4 translation models by GIZA++ toolkit. These pairs were also preprocessed before training. And the pairs whose information need part become empty after preprocessing were disregard-ed.

During the experiment, we found that some of the generated words in the information need parts are themselves. This is caused by the self translation problem in translation model: the highest transla-tion score for a word is usually given to itself if the target and source languages are the same (Xue et al., 2008). This has always been a tough ques-tion: not using self-translated words can reduce re-trieval performance as the information need parts need the terms to represent the semantic meanings; using self-translated words does not take advantage of the translation approach. To tackle this problem, we control the number of the words predicted by the translation model to be exactly twice the number of words in the corresponding preprocessed question.
The predicted information need words for the re-trieved questions are shown in Table 5. In Q1, the in-formation need behind question  X  recommend web-site for custom built computer parts  X  may imply that the users need to know some information about building computer parts such as  X  ram  X  and  X  moth-erboard  X  for a different purpose such as  X  gaming  X . While in Q2, the user may want to compare comput-ers in different brands such as  X  dell  X  and  X  mac  X  or consider the  X  price  X  factor for  X  purchasing a laptop for a college student  X .

We also did a small scale comparison between the generated information needs against the real ques-tions whose information need parts are not empty. Q3 and Q4 in Table 5 are two examples. The orig-inal information need for Q3 is  X  looking for beauti-ful beaches and other things to do such as museum-s, zoos, shopping, and great seafood  X  in CQA. The generated content for Q3 contains words in wider topics such as  X  wedding  X ,  X  surf  X  and the price infor-mation ( X  cheap  X ). This reflects that there are some other users asking similar questions with the same or other interests.

From the results in Table 3, we can see that the performance of most similarity methods were im-proved by making use of information need predic-tion. Different similarity measures received differ-ent degrees of improvement. LDA1 obtained the highest improvement followed by the TFIDF based method. These two approaches are more sensitive to the contents generated by a translation model. However we found out that in some cases the L-DA1 model failed to give higher scores to good rec-ommendation questions. For example, Q5, Q6, and Q7 in table 5 were retrieved as recommendation can-didates for the query question in Table 1. All of the three questions were good recommendation candi-dates, but only Q6 ranked fifth while Q5 and Q7 were out of the top 30 by LDA1 method. Moreover, in a small number of cases bad recommendation questions received higher scores and jeopardized the performance. For example, for query question  X  How can you add subtitles to videos?  X  with information need  X  ... add subtitles to a music video ... got off youtube ...download for this ...  X , a retrieved ques-tion  X  How would i add a music file to a video clip. ...  X  was highly recommended by TFIDF approach as predicted information need contained  X  youtube  X ,  X  video  X ,  X  music  X ,  X  download  X , ... .

The MRR score received an improvement from 92.5% to 95.8% in the  X  X est c X  and from 91.8% to 96.2% in  X  X est t X . This means that the top one ques-tion recommended by our methods can be quite well catering to the users X  information needs. The top five precision and the top ten precision scores us-ing TFIDF and LDA1 methods also received dif-ferent degrees of improvement. Thus, we can im-prove the performance of question recommendation by predicting information needs. In this paper we addressed the problem of recom-mending questions from large archives of commu-nity question answering data based on users X  infor-mation needs. We also utilized a translation mod-el and a LDA topic model to predict the informa-tion need only given the user X  X  query question. D-ifferent information need similarity measures were compared to prove that it is possible to satisfy user X  X  information need by recommending questions from large archives of community QA. The Latent Dirich-let allocation based approach was proved to perfor-m better on measuring the similarity between short texts in the semantic level than traditional method-s. Experiments showed that the proposed transla-tion based language model for question information need prediction further enhanced the performance of question recommendation methods.
