Survival time data are not amenable to standard statistical methods take a machine learning perspective and cast survival analysis as a ranking problem  X  X here the task One of the most popular performance measures for assessing learned models in survival analysis is the Concordance Index (CI), which is similar to the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic [13, 10] used in bi-partite ranking problems.
 Given the CI as a performance measure, we develop approaches that learn models by directly opti-mizing the CI. As optimization of the CI is computationally expensive, we focus on maximizing two lower bounds on the CI, namely the log-sigmoid and the exponential bounds, which are described in Hazard (PH) model, which is the standard model used in classical survival analysis, see Sec. 5.2. Moreover, as the PH models are learned by optimizing Cox X  X  partial likelihood in classical survival analysis, we show in Sec. 8 that maximizing this likelihood also ends up (approximately) maxi-mizing the CI. Our experiments in Sec. 9 show that optimizing our two lower bounds and Cox X  X  likelihood yields very similar results with respect to the CI, with the proposed lower bounds being slightly better. 2.1 Censored data at least C  X  i , i.e. , our actual observation is T i = min( T  X  i ,C  X  i ) .
 Let x i  X  R d be the associated d -dimensional vector of covariates (explanatory variables) for the i th individual. In clinical studies, the covariates typically include demographic variables, such as model for the survival time as a function of the covariates. 2.2 Failure time distributions The failures times are typically modeled to follow a distribution, which absorbs both truly random that S ( t ) = e  X   X ( t ) [4]. 2.3 Proportional hazard model Proportional hazard (PH) models have become the standard for studying the effect of the covariates effect of the covariates on the hazard function, i.e. , Equivalent formulations for the cumulative hazard function and the survival function include 2.4 Cox X  X  partial likelihood Cox noticed that a semi-parametric approach is sufficient for estimating the weights w in PH models assumption concerning the effect of the covariates on the hazard function is required. Parameter estimates in the PH model are obtained by maximizing Cox X  X  partial likelihood (of the weights) [2, 3]: derive valid (partial) maximum likelihood estimates of w [2, 3].
 outline this connection to the ranking of the times T i  X  X nd hence the concordance index X  X n Sec. 8. times can be ordered not only if (1) both of them are uncensored but also if (2) the uncensored time each filled vertex indicates an observed/uncensored survival time, while an empty circle denotes a from a censored point. 3.1 Concordance index For these reasons, the concordance index (CI) or c -index is one of the most commonly used per-ordered. In other words, it is the probability of concordance between the predicted and the observed survival. It can be written as concordance index can also be written explicitly as This index is a generalization of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistics [13, 10] and thus of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to regression problems in that it can (1) be applied to continuous prediction accuracy and c = 0 . 5 is as good as a random predictor. 3.2 Maximizing the CI X  X he Ranking Problem Since we evaluate the predictive accuracy of a survival model in terms of the concordance index, it is natural to formulate the learning problem to directly maximize the concordance index. Note used as an objective function during training. As the concordance index is invariant to any monotone the one of another individual. Very often the doctor would like to know whether a particular kind lows us to naturally incorporate the censored data. Once we have formulated it as a ranking problem we can use various ranking algorithms proposed in the machine learning literature [5, 7, 1, 12]. In this paper we use the algorithm proposed by [12].
 More formally, we would like to learn a ranking function f from a suitable function class F , such ranking functions 1 in this paper: F = { f w } , where for any x,w  X  X  d , f w ( x ) = w &gt; x . Maximizing the CI is a discrete optimization problem, which is computationally expensive. For this reason, we resort to maximizing a differentiable and concave lower bound on the 0-1 indicator function in the concordance index, cf. Eqs. 4 and 5. In this paper we focus on the log-sigmoid lower for the family of linear ranking functions, these two approaches are closely related to the PH model commonly used in survival analysis, cf. Sec. 5.2. The first subsection discusses the lower bound on the concordance index based on the log-sigmoid function. The second subsection shows that this bound arises naturally when using proportional hazard models. 5.1 Lower bound log [2  X  ( z )] / log 2 , is a lower bound on the indicator function (Fig. 1(c)), i.e. , The log-sigmoid function is concave and asymptotically linear for large negative values, and may hence be considered a differentiable approximation to the hinge loss, which is commonly used for training support vector machines. The lower bound on the concordance index (cf. Eq. 4) follows immediately: which can efficiently be maximized by gradient-based methods (cf. Sec 7). Given the linear ranking function f w ( x ) = w &gt; x , the bound As to avoid overfitting, we penalize functions with a large norm w in the standard way, and obtain the regularized version 5.2 Connection to the PH model The concordance index can be interpreted as the probability of correct ranking (as defined by the As this independence assumption obviously does not hold among all pairs due to transitivity (even though the individual samples i are assumed i.i.d.), it provides a lower bound on the concordance index.
 Sec. 2. Hence Pr [ f w ( x i ) &lt; f w ( x j ) | w ] = Pr [ T ( w &gt; x j ) &gt; T ( w &gt; x i ) | w ] = the manipulations: This derivation shows that the probability of correct pairwise ordering indeed follows the sigmoid posteriori (MAP) estimator is of the form the form of a penalized log-likelihood: This expression is equivalent to (8) except for a few constants that are irrelevant for optimization problem, which justifies our choice of regularization in Eq. 8. Fig. 1(c)). The concordance index can then be lower-bounded by b c simplifies to and, penalizing functions with large norm w , the regularized version reads avoids the need for computing the second derivatives. The convergence of CG is much faster than the gradient of Eq. 9 (log-sigmoid bound) is given by  X  w x )  X  w T ( x i  X  x j ) , and the gradient of Eq. 15 (exponential bound) by  X  w Our experimental results (Sec. 9) indicate that the Coxs method and our proposed methods showed similar performance when assessed using the CI. While our proposed method was formulated to concordance index. The argument presented below could give an indication as to why a method which maximizes the partial likelihood also ends up (approximately) maximizing the concordance index. We re-write the exponential bound on the CI for proportional hazard models from Sec. 6 b c E ( w ) = number of uncensored observations is denoted by N o . The Cox X  X  partial likelihood can be written in terms of z i as L ( w ) = Q T as This says maximizing min z i maximizes a lower bound on the concordance index. While this does maximize the geometric mean of z i , and hence the Cox X  X  partial likelihood. In this section we compare the performance of the two different lower bounds on the CI X  X he log-sigmoid, exponential, and Cox X  X  partial likelihood X  X n five medical data sets. 9.1 Medical datasets Table 1 summarizes the five data sets we used in our experiments. A substantial amount of data cell lung cancer patients, which we analyzed as part of our collaboration. The other medical data sets are publicly available: The SUPPORT dataset 2 is a random sample from Phases I and II of the SUPPORT [9](Study to Understand Prognoses Preferences Outcomes and Risks of Treatment) different cause of death. The MELANOMA data 3 is from a clinical study of skin cancer. 9.2 Evaluation procedure For each data set, 70% of the examples were used for training and the remaining 30% as the hold-out All the covariates were normalized to have zero mean and unit variance. As missing values were not the focus of this paper, we used a simple imputation technique. For each missing value, we imputed a sample drawn from a Gaussian distribution with its mean and variance estimated from the available values of the other patients. 9.3 Results The performance was evaluated in terms of the concordance index and the results are tabulated in Table 2. We compare the following methods X (1) Cox X  X  partial likelihood method, and (2) the pro-posed ranking methods with log-sigmoid and exponential lower bounds. The following observations can be made X (1) The proposed linear ranking method performs slightly better than the Cox X  X  par-that Cox X  X  partial likelihood may also end up maximizing the CI. (2) The exponential bound shows slightly better performance than the log-sigmoid bound, which may indicate that the tightness of the difference is not significant. In this paper, we outlined several approaches for maximizing the concordance index, the standard performance measure in survival analysis when cast as a ranking problem. We showed that, for the widely-used proportional hazard models, the log-sigmoid function arises as a natural lower bound on the concordance index. We presented an approach for directly optimizing this lower bound in a computationally efficient way. This optimization procedure can also be applied to other lower bounds, like the exponential one. Apart from that, we showed that maximizing Cox X  X  partial like-lihood can be understood as (approximately) maximizing a lower bound on the concordance index, which explains the high CI-scores of proportional hazard models observed in practice. Optimization of each of these three lower bounds results in about the same CI-score in our experiments, with our new approach giving tentatively better results. Acknowledgements We are grateful to R.
