 We investigate how to support ranked keyword search in a Parallel Search Cluster Network, which is a newly proposed peer-to-peer network overlay. In particular, we study how to efficiently acquire and distribute the global information required by ranked keyword search by taking advantage of the architectural features of PSCNs.

With the increasing scale and sophistication o fP2P net-works, keyword search techniques have been developed for data object ID search as well as for content search in various P2P network overlays. In keyword-based content search, one widely adopted ranking mechanism is TF  X  IDF [3]. How-ever, this ranking process requires aggregate information such as the total number o fdocuments that contain a spe-cific keyword. In a dynamic, decentralized P2P network environment, special care needs to be taken to meet this re-quirement. For instance, PlanetP [2] approximates TF  X  IDF at the peer level in order to save storage and communication cost in an unstructured P2P network. As another example, Shen et al. [4] build a hierarchical summary structure that indexes at document, peer, and super-peer levels for a super-peer network.

Since the Parallel Cluster Search Network [1], or PSCN in short, is a newly identified P2P architecture, we study how to support the ranking mechanism efficiently by taking ad-vantage o fits architectural characteristics. A PSCN is com-posed o fclusters o fpeers that are connected through FSLs (Forwarding Search Links) and NILs (Non-forwarding Index Links) [1]. In each cluster, peers are connected with FSLs, which transmit queries and results and allow the recipients to forward the received content. Between two clusters, there is one NIL from each peer in one cluster to one randomly selected peer in the other cluster, to transmit indexes and
Subsequently, the similarity between document D and query Q is calculated as follows:
Each peer maintains the inverted index o fits local docu-ments, but it lacks the global aggregate information used in TF  X  IDF calculation, such as N, f t and | D | . These global information will be obtained at the query time as necessary.
In a PSCN, local indexes are replicated over the network through NILs. Since there is a NIL from each peer to one randomly selected peer in each o fthe other clusters, collec-tively the indexes o fall peers in the network are available in each cluster.

At the query time, the querying peer forwards the query through FSLs to other peers in the cluster that it resides in. Upon receiving the query, the participating peers collect the local aggregate information related to the query based on the indexes they store locally, and return them to the querying peer. The local aggregate information are merged into the global aggregate information at the querying peer, and are distributed in the cluster. Next, each participating peer evaluates the query over the indexes it stores, ranks its query results locally, and sends the locally ranked query results back to the querying peer. Finally, the querying peer merges the locally ranked query results into globally ranked ones and returns all or top-K o fthem to the user.
In summary, ranked search in a PSCN has the following characteristics: (a) the most time-consuming tasks in the process o fhandling a ranked search query, i. e., local aggre-gate information collection and local ranking calculation, are distributed over all peers in one cluster; this distribution re-duces search load over peers evenly, reduces the maximum requirement for the capabilities of individual peers and im-proves the scalability o fthe network; (b) there is no global index built for every existing keyword in the network; this reduces the indexing load on individual peers; (c) each query is answered within the cluster where the query is submitted without affecting the completeness o fthe query result, which improves the query response time and saves communication cost.
Similar to the previous work, the indexes transmitted across clusters in a PSCN can be at the peer level, instead of at the document level. At the peer level, the global ranking is done for peers to indicate which peers are most likely to possess matching documents. To obtain these documents, the querying peer needs to forward the query to the top-k p peers in the global peer rank, each o fwhich in turn ranks its documents locally. Finally, the querying peer merges the query results and selects the global top-K documents.
In a P2P environment, the local index at a peer can be replicated over the network in various ways for different over-lays, and ranked search is performed based on the replicated indexes. We have presented the process o franked search in a PSCN,butthesameprocesscanbeappliedinotheroverlays
