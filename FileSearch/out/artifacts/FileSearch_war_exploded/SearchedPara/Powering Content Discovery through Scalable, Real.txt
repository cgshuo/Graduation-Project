 Outbrain is the Web X  X  leading content discovery service, recommending billions of stories daily to a global audience across many of the world X  X  most prestigious and respected publishers. Outbrain X  X  recommendation technology com-bines contextual cues with personalization, where the per-sonalization aspects are a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.

This paper, and the accompanying demo, offer a behind-the-scenes view of the content-based aspects of Outbrain X  X  personalization technology. We detail the types of features we extract from content, as well as the attributes we keep in each user X  X  content-affinity profile. We then describe and demonstrate how we update each user X  X  profile, in real time, as the user consumes content while browsing the Web.

The vast supply of items available to consume or buy on-line has given rise to the proliferation of recommendation systems [ ? ]. Pioneered in the pre-Web days by the Tapestry system [ ? ], recommender systems in the early days of the Internet were mostly found on e-commerce sites [ ? ]. To-day, advanced recommender systems also recommend music and videos, games and movies (e.g. by Pandora, YouTube,
At a high level, Outbrain employs a standard three-step recipe [ ? ] for producing the content-based aspect of our recommendations: Content understanding . We extract metadata and se-mantic features from each story we encounter. Metadata includes attributes like the publisher and section in which the story was published, the publish date, etc. Semantic features are derived, and include features such as categories that the story is associated with; latent topics [ ? ] that are present in the story; and prominent named entities that the story is about. This results in each story being represented by several -say k -vectors (e.g. category vector, latent topic vector, entities vector, etc).
 Profile Aggregation . As users consume stories on the Out-brain network of publishers, we aggregate the features of the stories each user consumes into a profile representing the content affinity of the user. The aggregation process is sequential, where each story the user consumes strengthens the user X  X  affinity to that story X  X  attributes, and causes some decay to the other affinities. In this manner, persistent in-terests of the user will stand out while temporary interests will eventually fade. This results in users also being repre-sented by k feature vectors. Unlike the sparse vectors that represent each story, user vectors are typically more dense. Matching . Since users are represented by aggregation of story features, both users and stories are represented in the same feature space, namely k feature vectors. This allows for similarity scoring between users and stories. At its sim-plest form, one can derive, per feature vector, a similarity score such as cosine measure, as is standard in Information Retrieval [ ? ], and then learn a predictive model over the k similarity scores.
We will demonstrate how user browsing actions are re-flected in the user profile, and how the user profile is lever-aged when producing personalized recommendations. Specif-ically, the demo we will show is comprised of the following steps: 1. Open a new incognito browser window, to generate a 2. Browse a few stories on publishers in the Outbrain
By  X  X ollaborative filtering persona X  we mean the data re-quired to compute collaborative filtering recommendations for the user. This can be a list of users exhibiting similar consumption patterns in user neighbourhood models [ ? ], or the user X  X  latent vector in matrix factorization schemes [ ? ].
