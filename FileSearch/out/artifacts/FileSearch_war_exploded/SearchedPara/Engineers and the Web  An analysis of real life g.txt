 1. Introduction
Over the last decade, the Web has become an increasingly important source of information for engineers ( Kraaijenbrink &amp; Groen, 2006 ). With the growing use of the Web as a source of information, new challenges have entered engineers X  information usage processes. Examples include dealing with information overload and establishing the quality of information found on the Web ( Choo, Detlor, &amp; Turnbull, 2000 ). To effectively deal with such challenges, it is necessary to understand them in detail. Existing studies have provided general insights into the challenges associated with information usage but they have not provided the detail necessary to effectively deal with them. The objective of this paper is to start filling this hole in the current literature by an in-depth analysis of information usage gaps.

As studies on sense-making gaps have demonstrated, an analysis of gaps is a very effective approach for producing detailed information on a process ( Dervin, 1992, 1999; Savolainen &amp; Kari, 2006 ). Using this approach, this study provides a detailed analysis of real life information usage gaps met by engineers in small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) involved in new product development (NPD). Data have been gathered using the critical incident interviewing technique (CIT) ( Flanagan, 1954 ). An analysis of the real life examples uncovered using this technique generates a typology of information usage gaps on a level of detail not previously provided by other studies.

The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it analyzes the complete information usage process of engineers, ranging from the initial identification of information to its usage in the firm. By categorizing the gaps that engineers face in this process, the paper provides a more comprehensive and systematic view of the Web information usage process, and the challenges associated with it, than found in earlier publications. Second, the paper documents the application of the CIT in the analysis of information usage processes. Although not new, the CIT has yet to be well documented. By providing a detailed description of how the CIT was applied in this study, the paper can guide other researchers in applying this technique.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the current literature on engineers X  infor-mation usage processes. Subsequently, Sections 3 and 4 outline the theoretical approach and the method used in this study to analyze information usage gaps. Section 5 presents the result of this analysis, and the paper ends with a discussion and conclusions (Section 6 ). 2. Literature review
Information usage processes have been intensively studied since the 1960s. Since then, these processes have been studied both at the level of individuals (e.g., Case, 2002; Krikelas, 1983; Kulthau, 1991; Taylor, 1968 ) and at the level of firms (e.g., Aguilar, 1967; Choo, 2002; Daft &amp; Weick, 1984; Rosenbloom &amp; Wolek, 1967 ). Since the rise of the Web in the 1990s, studies on information usage have, at both levels, increasingly included elec-tronic environments in general and the Web in particular ( Choo et al., 2000; Kraaijenbrink &amp; Groen, 2006;
Marchionini, 1995 ). Similar studies have focused on various groups of Web users, including children ( Borg-man, Hirsh, Walter, &amp; Gallagher, 1995 ), consumers ( Menon &amp; Raghubir, 2003; Moorthy, Ratchford, &amp; focus group of this study, engineers, has also been studied extensively. As examples, studies have been con-ducted on information usage by scientists and engineers ( Anderson, Glassman, McAfee, &amp; Pinelli, 2001; Ellis &amp; Haugan, 1997; Gralewska-Vickery, 1976 ), by R&amp;D departments ( Allen, 1977 ), and by new product devel-opers ( Court, 1997 ).

Numerous aspects of engineers X  use of information have been studied to date. A topic that has received much attention involves the types of information and the types of information source that are used. Studies have shown that engineers use a broad spectrum of information including market, technological, and organi-zational knowledge ( Faulkner &amp; Senker, 1995 ). It has also repeatedly been shown that this information is obtained mainly from customers and suppliers ( Jetter, Kraaijenbrink, Schro  X  der, &amp; Wijnhoven, 2005; Johnson &amp; Kuehn, 1987; White, Bennett, &amp; Shipsey, 1982 ). Such studies have also shown that engineers prefer personal to impersonal sources ( McGee &amp; Sawyerr, 2003; Tenopir &amp; King, 2004 ), prefer informal to formal sources ( Julien, 1995; Tenopir &amp; King, 2004 ), and prefer internal to external sources ( Robertson, 1974 ). Further, there have been studies explaining the decision to use one particular source or channel over another. Amongst the overview, it can be concluded that information usage by engineers, and in particular information seeking on the Web, have already been studied extensively.

Using information from the Web involves many challenges. Previous studies have highlighted challenges such as dealing with information overload ( Turetken &amp; Sharda, 2004 ) and establishing the quality and rele-vance of information found on the Web ( Borlund, 2003; Choo et al., 2000; Spink, Greisdorf, &amp; Bateman, 1998 ). Moreover, studies on website design and evaluation have suggested ways to meet these challenges.
Examples include choosing an appropriate browsing structure ( Lai &amp; Yang, 2000; Olston &amp; Chi, 2003 ), designing for interaction ( Chen &amp; Yen, 2004; Ellis, Wilson, Ford, Lam, &amp; Burton, 2002; Spink, 2002 ), and applying cognitive design ( Dalal, Quible, &amp; Wyatt, 2000 ).

Together, these studies have produced numerous useful insights into the way engineers use information found on the Web, into the challenges that are associated with this, and into ways to deal with these challenges. What these studies have in common is that they provide general knowledge that is likely to be gen-eralizable to a wide range of information users. However, these studies provide little guidance in how to deal with the specific challenges facing engineers when they want to use information from the Web. For example, knowing that accessibility is an important factor in explaining the choice of a particular information source does not tell us how to make a particular website more accessible. Similarly, knowing that interactive websites are more effective than non-interactive ones is not the same as providing guidelines on how to make a partic-ular website more interactive. These observations support Saracevic X  X  (1999) general concern of a growing gap between the human side and the system side of information science. This study starts to close this gap in the current literature by providing a detailed analysis of the gaps that engineers face in using information from the
Web. 3. Analyzing information usage gaps
The analysis of information usage gaps in this study draws on the notion of sense-making gaps ( Dervin, 1992, 1998 ) and its recent application to Web searching by Savolainen and Kari (2006) . Sense-making gaps are cognitive gaps as perceived by individuals, and they have been described as follows:  X  X  X rom time to time, movement is blocked by the perception of a cognitive gap  X  a situation in which people are unable to make sense of their experiences. To bridge this gap, individuals seek information to make new sense and use this information to help them continue on [ ... ] their journey X  X  ( Choo et al., 2000, p. 4 ). Hence, a sense-making gap triggers an individual to start looking for information. In addition to cognitive gaps, there can also be affective and situational gaps in the information usage process ( Choo et al., 2000; Menon &amp; Varadarajan, 1992 ). Affective gaps concern the fulfillment of emotional needs and are associated with uncertainty, anxi-ety, frustration, and stress ( Kulthau, 1991, 1993; Wilson, 1997 ). Situational gaps arise in a situation (environ-ment, context) in which actors are operating but cannot fulfill their tasks or perform their activities ( Wilson, 1981 ).

As used in their original senses, these three types of gaps trigger a search for information  X  information that can be used to bridge the gap. This study, however, like Savolainen and Kari X  X  study, analyzes gaps during the search for information from the Web. That is, this study does not analyze the reasons why engineers start looking for information but the gaps they face when they want to use information from the Web. Following
Dervin X  X  definition of a gap, an information usage gap is defined here as a discontinuity in the information usage process. In order to cope with such gaps, engineers will have to employ a gap-bridging activity. Follow-ing Savolainen and Kari, Web information usage is understood here as a dynamic process of gap-bridging triggered by gap-facing.

During the information usage process, engineers will face and bridge various gaps. The purpose of this study is to uncover and categorize these gaps. This requires an inductive approach in which the researcher enters the field without too many theoretical preconceptions. This does not mean that the researcher should enter the field with a completely open mind ( Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967 ). Rather, researchers need an appropriate lens to guide them to where one might expect gaps. An appropriate lens for this study is a model of the infor-mation usage process. Such a model suggests where to look for information usage gaps rather than what the actual gaps are likely to be. When we look at the range of information usage models, it appears that informa-tion usage is a process involving multiple steps ( Choo, 2002; Corner, Kinicki, &amp; Keats, 1994; Ellis &amp; Haugan, 1997; Kulthau, 1991; Leckie, Pettigrew, &amp; Sylvain, 1996; Wilson, 1997, 1999 ). Since we did not want to be directed by any specific model, it was decided to use a simple and general model reflecting the common factors in all these models. In this general model, information usage is considered to be a three-step process. Firstly, in order to be aware of its existence and location, information needs to be identified, for example by browsing, searching, or accidentally encountering information. Identification is an interactive process between informa-tion source and information user, eventually resulting in a  X  X ompromised need X  and  X  if successfully completed  X  in the finding of information ( Dervin, 1992; Taylor, 1968 ). After information is identified, it needs to be transferred to the user. The second step is thus information acquisition. In the case of Web searching this is not as straightforward as it may seem. In many cases it will not be the information as it appears on the
Web, but some meta-information reflecting the information that one needs. In such cases, actually acquiring the information will require additional effort such as interactive communication and cooperation between information source and information user. Finally, since the information is acquired for some purpose, it will probably be used by the engineer that has acquired it, or by one of their colleagues. The final step is therefore utilization. For example, the information could be stored in an archive, it could be applied in a business pro-cess, or it could be transformed into a more usable form (e.g., by translation). In the research described below, gaps associated with each of the three steps have been identified and categorized.

As touched upon in the above discussion on situational gaps, context is an important factor in many of the information usage models where it is mostly included as a factor from which information needs arise and in which information is used (e.g., Belkin &amp; Croft, 1992; Krikelas, 1983 ). Additionally, as stressed by Johnson (2003) , context is a crucial factor in shaping the information usage process: depending on the context, infor-mation usage processes can be very different. This implies that context should be taken into account in studies on information usage. Probably the most commonly applied method in studies on Web searching involves car-rying out research in an experimental setting ( Savolainen &amp; Kari, 2006 ). This has many benefits (such as inter-nal validity and reliability) but a limitation of such research is that it is conducted without a realistic context.
Since sense-making gaps are highly context-specific, experimental research is not appropriate for this study. A better approach is to study real life information usage processes in their context. An appropriate method for such a study is to inductively gather rich information on the information usage behavior of a particular group of people and, in this study, engineers. 4. Method
The three-step model of information usage gaps outlined above provides a means to analyze the informa-tion usage behavior of engineers during new product development (NPD). In this way, an inductive approach was followed staying as close as possible to the practices of engineers. In such an inductive approach it is important to obtain a rich and comprehensive picture of actual practice ( Lee &amp; Baskerville, 2003; Miles &amp;
Huberman, 1994 ). Spradley (1980) recommends highly intrusive techniques such as participant observation for this type of research. However, since information usage is an intangible process and not performed at one specific point in time, it is impracticable, if not impossible, to use this technique successfully. Instead, the critical incident interviewing technique (CIT) was used ( Flanagan, 1954 ). The CIT is recognized as a valid, reliable, and effective method for gathering rich qualitative data for a variety of purposes, including the anal-ysis of information behavior ( Fisher &amp; Oulton, 1999; Urquhart et al., 2003 ). Of the available interviewing techniques, CIT is considered to give one of the most accurate and reliable retrospective reports of processes as they take place in practice. Using this technique, interviewees are asked to describe in detail both successful and unsuccessful examples of the process under study. It is crucial in this type of interview that interviewees are allowed to concentrate on description and are not distracted by being asked for explanations of their behavior. If explanations are needed, these should only be sought after the description is complete.
A crucial step within the CIT is the demarcation of the critical incident. In this paper, this concerns whether respondents should be asked to describe incidents concerning Web information usage or information usage in general since the Web is but one of many information sources used in the NPD process. Moreover, in the information usage process, engineers switch frequently from one source to another, implying that the Web information usage process is interwoven with the wider information usage process. Given this strong connec-tion between the Web information usage process and the wider information usage process it was decided to ask respondents to describe examples illustrating processes of wider information usage. This paper, however, only reports those results that concern the use of information from the Web. 4.1. Interview scheme
Based on the characteristics of the CIT, a semi-structured interview scheme was developed that consisted of three parts. The purposes of the first part of the interviews were twofold. Firstly, it helped the interviewer gain a rich picture of the context and the general way in which information was used in the company. Secondly, it prepared the interviewee over the type of critical incidents to be described in the second part of the interview. This first part included the following topics: Description of the company, its products, markets, and recent and future developments.
 Description of the general NPD process in the company, including the role of the interviewee.

Description of the general information usage process during NPD in the company, including the identifi-cation, acquisition, and utilization of information from external sources.

The second and main part of the interview was used to obtain descriptions, explanations, and reflections of at least one successful and one unsuccessful incident concerning information usage in the company. To avoid distracting interviewees during the descriptive part, explanatory and reflective questions were only posed after the description was complete. Interviewees were asked about the following topics for each incident covered:
Description of a specific example of information usage during NPD in the company, including the identi-fication, acquisition, and utilization of information from external sources.
 Explanation of why they acted in the described way.
 Reflection on problems and potential improvements.

The final part of the interview was used to elicit additional details concerning the incidents by confronting the interviewee with a number of classifications, taken from the literature, on types of NPD problems, infor-mation needs, types of information, and information sources. This prompted respondents to reflect on their answers and helped them to remember additional details. 4.2. Sampling The targeted interviewees were engineers and NPD managers working for high-tech manufacturing SMEs.
In selecting interviewees, the principle of theoretical sampling was used ( Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967 ). Using this principle, the type and number of respondents are not established in advance, but result from the need for further exploration until theoretical saturation is achieved. The enquiry started with a selection of four respon-dents in the electronics industry, two in the chemical industry, and one machine manufacturer (see Table 1 for details). After an initial analysis of the seven interviews, it was concluded that there was a need for additional interviews: (1) at one similar machine manufacturer; (2) at one similar chemical company; (3) at one engineer-ing company; (4) with two people with different roles in one company; and (5) at science-based rather than technology-based companies in one industry. After analysis of these additional seven interviews, it was felt that saturation point had been reached. That is, no new types of information usage gaps were to be found.
To examine whether this was indeed the case, additional interviews were completed in three very different com-panies. In these three additional interviews no new types of information usage gaps were identified, which strengthened the confidence in having reached saturation point. 4.3. Analysis
Each of the 17 interviews lasted between 70 and 180 min, with an average of about 2 h. They were recorded and fully transcribed, resulting in 768 pages of double-spaced text. Information usage gaps were identified by comparing successful cases (i.e. where gaps were bridged) with unsuccessful cases (i.e. where gaps were not bridged) using the constant comparison method ( Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967 ). The total number of information usage processes described by the interviewees was 65, that is an average of close to four incidents per interview. For each example described by the interviewees, the sequence of activities and aspects was coded into an MS
Excel spreadsheet. Subsequently, words were identified indicating the existence of information usage gaps, that is, indicating a difference between an actual and a preferred state. Such words can express a gap (e.g. problem, difficult, too, not, do not), a preference (e.g. want, prefer, like), or an adjustment (e.g. change, trans-late, adjust). As a next step, the identified gaps were categorized into as many categories as possible, as rec-ommended in the constant comparison method. The final step was to reduce the number of categories to enable a more efficient classification. 5. Results
The analysis of the 65 incidents generated a list of gaps faced by engineers during the information usage pro-cess. Tables 2 X 4 , present identified gaps that are respectively associated with information identification (five cat-egories), acquisition (five categories), and utilization (five categories). As such, these tables are the main outcome of this study. Below, examples reflecting each of the fifteen categories are discussed in more detail. 5.1. Information identification
The first group of information usage gaps concerns the identification of information from outside the com-pany. As shown in Table 2 , these gaps mainly relate to how the information is organized and presented by its source, and to what extent users are able to specify their specific information needs. Five categories of gaps were identified with several examples of each shown in the table.

The respondents mentioned a number of gaps that were related to their information needs. Looking for common factors, these gaps suggest that most information sources are oriented towards users that need spe-cific information for a specific purpose whereas the engineers that were interviewed often had much vaguer intentions when they began to look for information. For example, they wanted to grasp how a particular domain that was new to them was organized ( X  X rientation X ) or they wanted to get ideas on how to proceed when they became stuck in an NPD process ( X  X nspiration X ). With intentions that are so vague, it is not surpris-ing that the respondents considered the path leading to the uncovering of information sometimes more impor-tant than the finding of the information itself. Precisely because they were not sure of what information they actually needed, they were quite happy to find interesting information that they had not even considered dur-ing their search path. This gap between an engineer X  X  initial need for information and their final need is a nat-ural characteristic of the information usage process (see, for example, the discussion on information identification in Section 3 ). However, as the engineers saw this gap as hindering them in identifying informa-tion, it is an important gap for them.

Where the respondents did have a clear idea of what information they needed, they found numerous gaps concerning the availability of that information. An interesting gap is that the users sometimes needed infor-mation that did not yet exist (or at least information which one or more  X  X ources X  indicated did not exist). As NPD involves the invention of new things, it seems natural that, given the particular context of this study, this gap should have appeared frequently. The fact that the engineers found that the necessary information did not yet exist, was not in all cases a negative outcome. It could provide them with an opportunity to develop this information (alone, or together with the  X  X ource X ) and use it in order to create a competitive advantage. Hence, in this particular context, discovering that the information needed does not exist could be the best possible outcome.

The third category of identification gap relates to the categorization of information. It appeared that the way information was categorized by and between sources was a major barrier to identifying information.
Probably the most crucial type of gap that was mentioned in this category is that many sources categorize their information based on the structure of their own organization rather than in a user-oriented way. As an exam-ple, as engineers, the respondents were often looking for particular components they could use in making a new product. In order to find such components, they needed categorizations based on component features (such as size or capacity). However, suppliers of such components often categorize this information based on the departments that produce the components within the company. As this categorization was unrelated to the component features the engineer was interested in, it was very hard for the engineer to find the required information.

Navigation was a fourth area in which gaps were mentioned. Of particular interest in the context of this study are the forward and backward chain links to suppliers and customers. A frequently used strategy in gathering information about competitors was to identify their suppliers and customers. While information on customers was usually available ( X  X orward chain links X ), it was very hard to discover a company X  X  suppliers ( X  X ackward chain links X ). Another interesting gap was that only very few websites provide the opportunity to move up a browsing tree. When arriving at particular information, such as a product description, the respon-dents often wanted to know whether a company produced other similar products. For that, they wanted to be able to move up one level in the browsing tree to find out whether there were other products in the same cat-egory. Sources X  websites, however, usually failed to provide such an option.
 Finally, information identification was hindered by language gaps between information sources and users.
This gap turned out to be particularly important in terms of formulating keywords. Many respondents indi-cated that identifying appropriate keywords to enter into a search engine was the most difficult part of the whole information usage process. Search engines were usually used as the first step of the process. At this point, the respondents did not really know what they were looking for, but only had vague ideas about the new product they had in mind. This means that the engineers had to think both about what they were going to look for and how they would label this. Once they had thought up some terms to enter, they faced the prob-lem that information sources often used different terms to themselves. Only when they had worked out what terms were used in the domain concerned, could they continue without too many problems. One language gap that appeared particularly significant was the use of commercial brand names and technical names in describ-ing a product. Being technical, the engineers usually used a technical name in querying a product. However, sources X  websites, generally used as marketing channels, usually used commercial brand names instead. This made it hard for the engineers to identify the relevant product. 5.2. Information acquisition
The second group of information usage gaps is associated with the acquisition of information. These gaps concern the transfer of information from a source to a user. As Table 3 indicates, five categories of informa-tion acquisition gaps were identified.

The first type of acquisition gap is related to carriers of information. NPD is a process aimed at the creation of physical products and, for the development of such products, engineers require a huge amount of informa-tion. Some of this information is available in the form of documents and people. However, other information is not available in such forms. Therefore, engineers also need physical products and components as carriers of information. They order these products/components and deconstruct them in their lab. This means that the ordering of products/components through the Web is an important aspect of information acquisition. In the interviews, the respondents commented that sources treat these aspects separately; that is, information provision and ordering facilities are usually provided at separate locations within a website and are not well linked.

Even when information is available, this does not mean it can be acquired by a user. Property right issues form another acquisition barrier, for example, in the form of patents. While patent databases were reported to be important sources of information, legal restrictions meant that acquiring and using the information was often impossible. A related gap is the fact that sources tend not to publish valuable information on the Web. Publishing information in full would amount to giving the information away for free. Therefore, sources publish meta-information, describing the information, or only excerpts from the information. Information users, however, need the full information. Hence, from the perspective of the user, there is a gap between the information they have identified and require, and the information they can acquire directly.

A third category of acquisition gap relates to the roles and matching of actors. NPD involves the crossing of domains and areas of expertise, and respondents mentioned many gaps related to this. An interesting gap here concerns the level of collectiveness. On their websites, many companies present themselves as an organi-zational unity rather than as a collection of individuals. The engineers that were interviewed, however, were usually much more interested in particular people (usually other engineers) within the other company, for example because these would be the only ones in the company who would understand their questions. It seemed to be very difficult to obtain information from such individuals. Another gap in this category that was frequently mentioned was the gap between information source and user in terms of areas of expertise.
It appeared that most websites were developed by the marketing department of a company. The websites were designed with a typical customer in mind as the target group. However, engineers are a very different group, using the websites for very different purposes. For example, the respondents did not want to buy products; they wanted to find the technical details of the product and its components. Websites, however, often fail to provide such details.

The respondents also mentioned a number of gaps related to time issues. In general, users want the infor-mation immediately. As it will take some time to find information and then obtain it, there is usually a time gap between the occurrence of an information need and acquiring the relevant information. From the inter-views, it appeared that in using information obtained from the Web this time gap is strongly felt, a finding which is consistent with previous research. The engineers expected much faster responses using the Web than using other channels. Respondents even mentioned a few times that when they did not feel they were getting any closer to the information they needed within a few clicks, they would immediately switch to another web-site and forget the previous one. Quickly perceiving a feeling of getting closer to the relevant information appeared to be more important than actually finding the information quickly. This seems to be in line with Pirolli and Card X  X  (1999) information foraging theory.

Finally, the respondents mentioned acquisition gaps related to finance. An interesting gap here is between the value of information to the user and the value of this same information to the source. As noted above, many websites are developed for marketing purposes. Put simply, the objective of these websites is to increase sales of a company X  X  products by providing information to potential customers. Hence, it is not the informa-tion that is seen as the most valuable component, but the products it describes. Conversely, the engineers that were interviewed were more interested in the information about a product than in the actual product. This means that the value of the actual information is higher for the user than for the source. The opposite was also found. For example, an engineer investigating a new market might find sources providing market reports but these reports are seen as too expensive by the engineer X  X  company. 5.3. Information utilization
The final group of information usage gaps concerns the utilization of information. These gaps concern the question as to whether the information acquired is actually applicable for the NPD problem for which it was sought. Table 4 lists five categories of utilization gap which are discussed below in some detail.
The first type of information utilization gap relates to the application domain of the information and the information user. Using information from another domain (e.g., a different industry) than the domain of their own company is an essential part of the NPD work of engineers. They often take a solution that is used in another industry and change it such that it can be used in the given domain. Although this is an effective way of developing new products, it involves challenges. In the source domain, products are used for certain applications and described in terms of those applications. For example, in its original application, a small fluid container is used for the storage of insulin for diabetes patients. Consider an engineer in another industry wanting to use it as a container within a medicine sprayer: this engineer faces the problem that no-one has thought about this application for the container. Consequently, the engineer has to translate the information to this new domain.

A second category of gap relates to the level of aggregation of information. During the interviews it appeared that the information engineers found was often described at a lower or a higher level of aggregation than what they needed. For example, when engineers were trying to find out how a particular industry was organized, they could only find information from and about individual companies within that industry. A sim-ilar type of gap emerged when they were looking for information about specific components, products, or product packages. For example, engineers might be looking for information on a particular component, whereas sources only provided information about a product in which the component was used.

Thirdly, many gaps were mentioned that were related to the level of abstraction of the information. An important gap in this category concerns the constant interplay between application, function, and form during the information usage process of engineers. Since NPD, almost by definition, involves finding new solutions, respondents faced the problem that they more or less only knew what the solution they had in mind should do; that is, they knew the required function. However, they did not know what form was needed or indeed avail-able to fulfill that function. Conversely, sources of information usually described the form or application of a solution, and not its function. An example concerns a case where one of the respondents needed small lamps that were more robust than ordinary light bulbs. He knew what size the lamp should be, how much light it should produce, and the maximum amount of heat it should produce (i.e. its function), but not whether such a lamp existed and, if so, what it was called (i.e. its form). Only after a long search did he find out that such a lamp existed: they were called high-efficiency LEDs, which was the name given by the source to reflect the per-ceived benefit of increased efficiency (application).

A fourth category of gap was related to the quality of the information provided. Quality includes criteria such as correctness, completeness, and certainty of information. For each of these criteria, and the other cri-teria mentioned in Table 4 , there appeared to be a stepwise gap when moving from the information needed to the information found. That is, there were gaps between the information that was needed, the information received as perceived by the user, the information as claimed by the source, and the factual information that could be used. In order to utilize the information the respondents needed to bridge all of these gaps.
Finally, the respondents mentioned gaps related to missing and non-comparable information. The gaps in this category reflect the reality that the information provided is not the information that is exactly needed. In order to be able to use the provided information, engineers have to, for example, interpolate or extrapolate it because they need the information for a different value of a variable. The respondents also mentioned a few times that they had looked in vain for information representing a standard, or reference norm. In such a form, it would be relatively easy for them to translate the information to their own situation. The information they found, however, represented individual unique cases that were hard to compare and translate to their own situation. 6. Discussion and conclusion
As the developers of new products and processes, engineers are a driving force for innovation in today X  X  society. In doing their work, they rely on a large amount of information from external sources, of which the Web is among the most important. This paper started with the assumption that, if we want to support engineers, a deep understanding is needed of the challenges that they face when they use information obtained from the Web. An initial literature review had shown that the current literature does not provide such an understanding at the necessary level of detail.

This paper has begun the process of filling this hole in the current literature by studying information usage gaps as perceived by engineers when trying to use Web-based information. As context is a crucial factor in information use processes, it was decided to study information usage gaps in real life situations rather than in a somewhat artificial experimental setting. The critical incident interviewing technique was used to gather 65 real life examples of information usage by engineers. The analysis of these examples yielded five classes each of information identification gaps, information acquisition gaps, and information utilization gaps. Within each class, various types of gaps were identified (see Tables 2 X 4 ).
 In comparing the results of this study with previous studies, the following observations can be made.
Firstly, some of the gaps that were found in this study are in line with the findings of previous research on information usage by engineers. Examples include the gap between initial information need and final informa-tion need, and the gap between the amount and quality of information provided and that needed. Such con-sistency extends the generalizability of the comparable studies into the particular context of the current study.
Also, through its comprehensive approach, the current study systemizes the insights into gaps identified in ear-lier studies.
 Secondly, and more interestingly, many gaps were identified that had not been reported in previous studies.
These include gaps related to forward and backward chain links (identification), to switching between infor-mation carriers (acquisition) and to translation from application through function to form (utilization). This identification of these  X  X ew X  gaps, listed in Tables 2 X 4 , is seen as the key contribution of this paper. They not only suggest opportunities for website designers to modify websites to meet the needs of engineers, they also open up opportunities for new research.

Thirdly, no previous study has identified such a large number of information usage gaps. Although no par-ticular number of gap types was expected in advance, the fact that 79 different types of gaps were found seems a surprisingly high figure. This is probably a result of the rich empirical research method that was adopted.
Many of the earlier studies have used a deductive approach in which most of the theory and research is designed in advance of measurements since such an approach is rigorous, transparent, and predictable. In con-trast, this study followed an inductive approach with only a theoretical lens to guide the data collection and analysis process. While the risk of this approach is drowning in the vast amount of information gathered, this study has shown that it can lead to new insights that are unlikely to be uncovered in a more deductive approach. Moreover, by providing a detailed account of the procedure that was followed, the paper illustrates how the CIT can be effectively used in practice.
 Fourthly, designers of websites have given a lot of attention to the esthetics and appearance of websites.
This attention seems surprising given that none of the gaps identified were related to such issues. In other words, perhaps website designers are focusing on the wrong issues. Rather than appearance, functionality seems to be the key issue for our respondents. They were looking for information, and the websites should help them as far as possible in that aim. The respondents also remarked that the information usage process should be fun to work with. However, by fun they did not imply that websites should include all kinds of ani-mations, or java applications. One respondent gave an example of what he meant by fun: he thought Google was fun because during a search for information he found all kind of interesting things he was not looking for.
This study has provided a systematic categorization of gaps that engineers currently face when they try to find and use information on the Web. The long list of information usage gaps uncovered in this study suggests that there are several opportunities for improvement. In comparing this list to a range of current websites, we indeed concur with the engineers that many of these opportunities are currently not exploited. For example, the translation between form and function, as far as we can tell, has yet to be implemented in any website despite having been the main principle in the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) for more than 50 years ( Altshuller, 1996 ). It seems plausible that this gap between theory and practice exists partly because of a lack of understanding of the challenges associated with using information on the Web. As this study has contributed towards a better understanding, the findings can help to overcome the problem. However, both the designers and owners of websites may have good reasons for not grasping such opportunities. It might well be that many of the identified gaps are not worth bridging (in terms of benefits accruing to the website owner) or seen as impossible to bridge. Therefore, future research should investigate to what extent it is real-istic to bridge the gaps that have been identified here. Such research should address two types of questions.
Firstly, future research should address the question as to whether the gaps should be bridged. This concerns the size and the importance of the gaps for information users, and the number of information users facing similar gaps. The larger and more important the gap, and the larger the number of information users facing this gap, the more important and worthwhile it is to bridge it. While this study has concentrated on informa-tion users, future research should also include information sources since websites will only be successful when their interests are also met.

Secondly, future research should also address the question as to whether these gaps can be bridged. As can be deduced from Tables 2 X 4 some of the gaps would be hard to bridge by modifying website design alone.
Examples of such gaps are the relative meaning of qualifiers and the different interests of actors. A well-designed website could contribute to narrowing these gaps, but cannot completely bridge them. Whereas the analysis of information usage gaps, and establishing their importance, can be achieved empirically, linking this to design requires a more creative approach ( Laurel, 2003 ). One suggested avenue for future research is to ask engineers which websites they particularly like and dislike. These websites could then be analyzed and compared to provide clues on how gaps could be avoided by designing better websites.
