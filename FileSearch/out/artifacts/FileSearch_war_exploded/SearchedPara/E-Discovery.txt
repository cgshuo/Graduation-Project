 It is common practice in the U.S. for courts to require that the parties to a legal case make availa ble to one anothe r all material relevant to the case, including electronically held data and documents. For large corporati ons, such relevant information may encompass terabytes of e-mail and other files spanning many years. The challenge of E-Discovery in response to a court order is (in a relatively short amount of time) to identify, assemble, individuate, access, categorize, and analyze an organization's electronically held material, segregate all  X  X rivileged X  material (which can be legally withheld), and present to the court all (and only) the required documents. The techniques needed to accomplish such a task necessarily include search, clustering, classification, filtering, social network analysis, extraction, and more  X  a nd no one of these is sufficient. The panel will describe this problem in detail, providing additional background and context on E-Discovery generally, and will explore specific techniques and cases that amply demonstrate why E-Discovery is quintessentially a  X  X IKM X  problem  X  multi-disciplinary, multi-technology, and  X  X ulti-difficult.
