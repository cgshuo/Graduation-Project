 How to organize and visualize big amount of text messages stored hardly be organized by threads as we do for emails due to lack of semantic model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). students during 6 months. [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval; I.5.4 [Applicati ons]: Text Processing; Algorithms, Experimentation Dirichlet Allocation. For their convenience and efficien cy, text messages have become one of the most popular applicati ons on mobile phones, especially among young people. This brings the problem on how to organize senders/receivers or by their contents. Some advanced clients can organize the messages as conversa tions, so the messages one sent conversations based on their seman tic meaning. Here, we define a conversation in text messages as follows: created in a time-series, focusing on a certain topic. adjacent text messages. Consider ing that a conversation spanning candidate conversations. conversation detection through tem poral clustering. The approach is based on the following assumption: the time gap between any adjacent text messages those belong to conversations. candidate conversations. below already have been divided into a specified sub-collection). time i n  X  X  X  is the timestamp of the th i text message exchanged in the sub-collection. between adjacent text messages through:

Here, in order to smooth the value of intra-cluster compactness consuming, so we propose an a pproximation algorithm to find the function decreases monotonically before the minimal value and it constraint the range to be evaluated. case, we combined the separated candidate conversations by their the semantic similarity between adjacent candidate conversations, conversation consolidation.
