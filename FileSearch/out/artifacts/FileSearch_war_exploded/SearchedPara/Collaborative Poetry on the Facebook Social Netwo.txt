Design, Human Factors Collaboration, Social Networks, Creativity, Facebook Recent statistics show the unpreced ented growth of the popularity of social networks. Facebook, the mo st famous social network, is the second most visited website on the Internet [1]. Previous research has identified many characteristics of social networks that can support creative collabora tion. These studies have argued that not only these networks provide members with control over timing and content of their contributions, but also they provide ease of communication over a wide geographical area and the possibility of engaging with a diverse group of people with minimal cost, effort and risk [5 ] [8]. Additionally, many social networks support multimedia content through the sharing of various media such as images, video and audio. In this project, we created a multimedia poetry project,  X  X ur Digital Tapestry X , in order to investigate the possibilities as well as limitations involved in engaging in creative collaboration on the popular social network, Facebook. Another motivation for this project was to examine how using such a medium can affect the form and content of the contributions. Many factors identified as important for the immense success of social networks are relevant to online creative collaboration as well. By transcending geographical and social boundaries, these networks provide members with the opportunity to socially engage with a diverse group of pe ople with minimal cost and risk. While being a member of a social network provides access to a community that can provide tec hnical and emotional support, it does not directly impose requireme nts on the level of involvement for each member. Thus, members have flexibility and control over the content and timing of their e ngagement with other members. Furthermore, the medium can be more  X  X emocratic X , in the sense that the lack of social status cues helps the development of relationships that might be prevented by offline social barriers [9]. Social networks have been used to facilitate collaboration in the business environment [2]. Also, it has been observed that many artist groups use Facebook as a tool to publish information about their activities and projects and to communicate with fans. However, professional artists tend to prefer other means of collaboration and use social netw orks mainly for promotional activity [7]. In order to examine the possibilities and issues of initiating and conducting a creative collaboration project on a social network first hand, we created  X  X ur Dig ital Tapestry X . Over a period of four weeks, nineteen partic ipating poets from five cities collaborated on the project. The result of the collaboration is a multimedia poem written in two la nguages, English and Farsi. The poem included hyperlinks to videos and images. The poem along with information about the collaborating poets is maintained on a separate website [6]. Each week an original short poem was posted on the  X  X tatus X  field of the researcher X  X  Facebook profile . In Facebook,  X  X tatus X  refers to a short public text message that each user can associate with his or her profile. Members typically use this field to share news, opinions or other forms of immediat e information, such as travel destinations, in a public manner. For the duration of the week, collaborators participated by adding their own poetry or posting links to multimedia content outside the social network website. The participating poets as well as the audience were all members of the social network of the re searcher. The participating poets were recruited through a Facebook message that explained the project. In this way, the researcher was involved in the project not only as an initiator and collaborator but also as the main social link between all the participants . In previous research, it is stressed that assuming the role of artist-researcher can provide insight into the creative process that might not be possible otherwise [4]. Figure 1 shows an excerpt from  X  X ur Digital Tapestry X . Each contribution is marked by a times tamp as well as a thumbnail of the profile picture of the particip ant. This is convenient because anybody visiting the page could identify which section of the poem was written by whom and directly could contact the poet if desired. As can be seen, three scripts are used to write this section of the poem: English, Fars i and  X  X inglish X , which is Farsi written using English letters. During the project, we observed that the poem often took the form of a dialogue between different participating poets. This resembled, in form, the message s regularly sent in Facebook via the  X  X tatus X  field. The main di fference was in the language used. By consciously engaging in a poetry project, the users were expressing themselves in a poetic form on a public space. Since the researcher was also the initiator and a collaborating poet in the project, many of the submitted poems were written in response to his original posts. We have presented  X  X ur Digital Tapestry X , a collaborative poetry project on Facebook. In this project, nineteen poets were able to use the social network to collaborate on a multimedia poem. In future work, we plan to use autoethnography to identify and examine the factors that were en countered in the creative process by the artist-researcher [3]. [1] Alexa Top 500 Global Sites.
