 Abstract The aim of this paper is to illustrate the potential of a parallel corpus in the context of (computer-assisted) language learning. In order to do so, we propose to answer two main questions (1) what corpus (data) to use and (2) how to use the corpus (data). We provide an answer to the what-question by describing the importance and particularities of compiling and processing a corpus for pedagogical purposes. In order to answer the how-question, we first investigate the central concepts of the interactionist theory of second language acquisition: comprehensible input, input enhancement, comprehensible output and output enhancement. By means of two case studies, we illustrate how the abovementioned concepts can be realized in concrete corpus-based language learning activities. We propose a design for a receptive and productive language task and describe how a parallel corpus can be at the basis of powerful language learning activities. The Dutch Parallel Corpus, a ten-million word sentence aligned and annotated parallel corpus, is used to develop these language tasks.
 Keywords Parallel corpus Interactionist theory CALL Corpus CALL Data driven learning Language teaching/learning 1 Introduction: the use of corpora in (computer-assisted) language learning The overall availability of corpora has facilitated access to corpus materials for a wide range of users, with different (linguistic) backgrounds, using corpora for diverse exploitation purposes. 1 While a lot of corpus research has focused on either descriptive grammatical or lexical issues in monolingual or multilingual corpora, an important amount of literature can also be found on the value of using corpora in language pedagogy. Although the influence of corpus-based research on language teaching in the actual language classroom still remains rather limited (Tribble 2000 ; Cheng 2010 ), there is consensus among researchers that the use of corpora for language learning 2 in general as well as more specifically for computer-assisted language learning (CALL) has brought forth a  X  X  X orpus revolution X  X  3 (Mukherjee 2006 : 5).

Following Leech ( 1997 ), 4 Ro  X  mer (2008 X 2009), and McEnery and Xiao ( 2011 ), we can distinguish two major types of corpus use 5 in the context of language teaching and pedagogy i.e. indirect and direct applications. As described by Ro  X  mer (2008 X 2009), indirect corpus applications use corpus materials for linguistic descriptions, which can serve as a valuable resource for the development and elaboration of corpus-based course materials. McEnery and Xiao ( 2011 ) also noted that corpora have been mainly used indirectly in language teaching and learning. One of the frequently cited examples in this context (e.g. Cheng 2010 ; Mukherjee 2006 ; Nesselhauf 2004 ; Yoon 2008 ) is the Collins COBUILD Language Database (Sinclair 1987 ),  X  X  X he first corpus-based dictionary X  X  (Mukherjee 2006 : 7), which was developed to  X  X  X pply results from native speaker corpus analyses to the improvement of pedagogic material X  X  (Nesselhauf 2004 : 126). Besides corpus-based developments in the field of lexicography (e.g. the Routledge series of Frequency dictionaries), the availability of corpora gave rise to a series of corpus-based reference works such as text books and grammars (e.g. Carter and McCarthy 2006 ; Hunston and Francis 1998 ), which introduced corpora X  X e it indirectly X  X n the classroom.

Direct applications , on the other hand, put the emphasis on the interaction between the learner/teacher and the actual corpus materials. This approach has also been labeled data driven learning (DDL) (Johns 1991 ), which basically refers to an inductive bottom-up approach of language learning whereby learners act as actual language researchers by observing and exploring text samples in order to discover certain patterns of use, meanings, etc. Text samples used in a DDL approach are very often concordances 6 (i.e. a list of occurrences of a keyword, word combination, etc. in a context 7 based on a particular corpus). The use of monolingual concordances for the inductive approach has possibly been one of the most important starting points for DDL research (Flowerdew 1996 ; Frankenberg-Garc X   X  a 2005 ; Granath 2009 ). On the other hand, text samples taken from learner corpora, which consist of texts  X  X  X roduced by non-native speakers of the language X  X  (Gilquin and Granger 2010 : 361), 8 are often used by teachers in order to draw attention to difficult contrastive problems. Parallel corpora, which consist  X  X  X f a set of texts in language A and their translations in language B X  X  (Kenning 2010 : 487) and their parallel concordances (occurrences in both language A and language B) have been studied less frequently in a pedagogical context (Frankenberg-Garc X   X  a 2003 ) although containing at least as much X  X f not more X  X otential for language learning as monolingual concordances. However, when studying literature on the use of parallel corpora for language learning, we notice that its value is often underes-timated. References to parallel corpora and its concordances often only stress their interest and importance for translation studies (Ro  X  mer 2008  X 2009; Gao 2011 )or conceive their use as a more traditional approach:  X  X (a)s translation has always been a focal point in language education in Japan, it (use of parallel concordances) fits nicely into this traditional way of looking at languages X  X  (Szirmai 2002 :101). Still, a number of experimental studies have proven the interest of using parallel corpora and concordances in language learning. Gao ( 2011 ) illustrated how higher intermediate learners of English, conducting a target language (L2) writing task, were able to X  X utonomously X  X orrect their tasks with the help of parallel concordances. The study of St.John ( 2001 ) demonstrated that parallel concordances may also have beneficial effects for beginner-level students as they may help the learners with lexical issues during task performance. This experimental study supports the ideas of Barlow ( 1996 , 2000 ) who claimed that parallel texts are valuable as an  X  X  X n-line contextualized bilingual dictionary X  X . A similar idea was presented by Dickens and Salkie ( 1996 ), who made a distinction between the  X  X  X asic translation equivalence X  X  (as in dictionary translations) and  X  X  X ich translation equivalence X  X  given by the parallel corpus. Other studies described the use of parallel texts 9 with explicit pedagogical uses (Frankenberg-Garc X   X  a 2005 ; Lixun 2001 ). Frankenberg-Garc X   X  a( 2005 ) illustrated how parallel concordances may be used for receptive tasks, language correction, language exercises and testing. In his paper, Nerbonne ( 2000 ) stressed the importance of parallel texts for CALL and underlined the need to process and align the parallel texts in order to make them valuable for applications.

Based on our (non-exhaustive) literature review, we may advocate that the concrete use of parallel corpora in CALL deserves more in-depth research. That is why the present study aims at investigating the opportunities and possible exploitations of a parallel corpus in the context of CALL by moving beyond the mere use of ready-made parallel concordances.

Our paper is structured as follows: in the next part (see Sect. 2 ), we will answer the question what corpus to use. We focus on the requirements that should be met when compiling a pedagogically relevant parallel corpus (see Sect. 2.1 ), consider the types of pedagogical processing of the content (see Sect. 2.2 ), and present the Dutch Parallel Corpus (DPC) (Paulussen et al. 2013 ) (see Sect. 2.3 ). In Sect. 3 , we present the main concepts of the interactionist Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theory and their potential value for corpus-based CALL activities. We will focus on the concepts of comprehensible input, input enhancement, comprehensible output and output enhancement. In the fourth part (see Sect. 4 ), we will illustrate how each of these components may be realized by means of two different case studies. The corpus-based comprehensible input and input enhancement will be illustrated by means of a CALL reading task ( see Sect. 4.1 ). A case study on the use of corpora for writing will illustrate its potential for supporting the production of comprehensible output and the creation of opportunities for output enhancement (see Sect. 4.2 ). The aim of both case studies is not to present a corpus-based ready-made software application but rather a conceptual framework, which may substantiate the design of concrete language tasks. 2 What corpus to work with? Compiling and processing a pedagogically relevant corpus It has been claimed that corpora can only be used effectively in the language classroom if a number of prerequisites are met (Gabrielatos 2005 ). This part will outline a number of corpus-related requirements at the level of corpus compilation (see Sect. 2.1 ) and corpus processing (see Sect. 2.2 ) and present the DPC (see Sect. 2.3 ). 2.1 Corpus compilation One of the important issues in a corpus-based approach to language teaching concerns the design and compilation of a pedagogically relevant corpus. Thus, not every corpus is suited for classroom or learning purposes. In fact, there is a strong  X  X  X eed for pedagogically motivated corpus content [which] is well reflected in the many initiatives in tertiary education to create small  X  X ome-made X  or  X  X d-hoc X  corpora which contain similar texts and are more coherent than traditional corpora X  X  (Braun 2007 : 308). From what we described above, it is clear that corpus compilation is a crucial yet very delicate issue in language pedagogy. Mishan ( 2004 ) advocated that one of the basic assumptions concerns the fact that corpus materials are authentic. Whereas the use of corpora has often been described as  X  X  X uthenticity X  X  in the classroom (Ackerley and Coccetta 2007 ; Gilquin and Granger 2010 ; Nerbonne 2000 ; etc.), it has also been claimed that corpus texts are not  X  X  X he real language X  X  (Gavioli 2005 : 18). However, in the context of language teaching and learning, the notion of  X  X uthenticity X  can become problematic. In this perspective, a frequently cited researcher is Widdowson (see e.g. Ackerley and Coccetta 2007 ; Braun 2005 ; Gilquin and Granger 2010 ; Mishan 2004 ) whose views on authenticity have played an important role in the conceptualization of what constitutes a pedagogically relevant corpus. Widdowson questioned the concept of authenticity and distinguished between text production and text reception (Widdowson 2000 ). It is on the level of text reception (learner reading/using the text) that the relationship between the learner and the text becomes problematic as the latter lacks authenticity :  X  X  X t]he language cannot be authentic because the classroom cannot provide the contextual conditions for it to be authenticated by the learners X  X  (Widdowson 1998 : 171). The learner is said to have problems to engage with the text, which makes the authentic character disappear. More precisely, when learners receive texts from a corpus, the text has to be seen in its wider context. Because this context is often not available, it becomes impossible for the learner to engage with the text.

In order to tackle the issue of authenticity, Gilquin and Granger ( 2010 ) proposed several solutions. One of those solutions may be to compile a pedagogic corpus that  X  X  X elp[s] learners  X  X uthenticate X  X  X (Widdowson 2003 as cited by Gilquin and Granger 2010 : 360). The compilation of a pedagogic corpus consists of three major phases: corpus design, text collection and preparation (Kenning 2010 ). When compiling a pedagogical corpus, we can state that the corpus design should consist of two types of requirements: the specific pedagogical criteria and the general corpus require-ments (see Table 1 ).

The pedagogical requirements concern first of all the type of content included in the corpus: is the content motivating and interesting for the target audience? Are the materials in accordance with the pedagogical needs (Braun 2006 ) or put differently, is it possible for learners to  X  X uthenticate X  with the included corpus materials? Each text should subsequently be accompanied by a set of pedagogically relevant metadata that make it possible to easily exploit the texts through any type of interface (e.g. embedded in a CALL application). Important metadata are the difficulty level (e.g. following the Common European Framework of Reference, Council of Europe 2001 ) of the text. For each text, a theme and domain can be added. Additionally, each text receives a keyword and the presence of (technical) jargon (e.g. economic texts may contain a lot of financial terminology) may also be determined as that often influences the difficulty level of the text.

On the other hand, some general requirements have to be included. By  X  X  X eneral X  X , we mean that the requirements are not specifically pedagogical. General require-ments may thus be applicable to any type of corpus, irrespective of the concrete exploitation objectives. For parallel corpora, the most important requirements are the quality of the texts and their translations. The idea of balanced corpus content is important and can be found at the level of the text types and the translation directions. The criteria are summarized in Table 1 .

The next phase consists in finding texts that are in accordance with the established set of requirements and specifications and for which high quality text providers should be contacted in order to obtain the actual texts and clear copyright issues (De Clercq and Montero Perez 2010 ). 2.2 Corpus processing Compiling a pedagogical corpus does not only consist in finding suitable texts. Corpus data need to be processed in order to augment their pedagogical exploitation potential. In this section, we describe the importance of three processing stages, which transform raw corpus data into enriched exploitable texts (see Sect. 4 ). 2.2.1 Annotating and aligning texts As was pointed out by Braun ( 2005 : 54):  X  X  X he major task of the annotation is to support pedagogically motivated corpus queries X  X . Annotation is a preliminary step for any form of exploitation, since you can only get information out of a text in as far you have stored information into the text. Annotation requires segmentation of a text into words and sentences before lemmatizing and adding part-of-speech (PoS) tags. First of all, if texts are linguistically annotated, the user can carry out a linguistic search on the corpus, for example to use the corpus as a reference resource (see case study 2, Sect. 4 ). Learners can look up a specific structure and define the PoS (e.g. the verb consist and the preposition of) but they can also formulate a more abstract query search such as the sequence VERB PREP NOUN. The lemmatization is crucial for learners who want to look up different word forms that pertain to one lemma. By searching on a lemma, results will contain more occurrences of, for instance, a verb than a search on an exact word form and can therefore provide more interesting information.

The alignment on paragraph and/or sentence level is another crucial aspect of the data processing in a pedagogical context (Nerbonne 2000 ) and is also indispensable to provide parallel concordances. Its value for L2 learners lies precisely in the fact that the smaller the unit (paragraph or sentence) in which the queried structure can be found, the easier they will deal with the input and retrieve the desired information. The importance of sentence-aligned concordances will be illustrated in both case studies (see Sect. 4 ) by means of different examples.

It should be noted that the processing steps are fully automatic and corpus builders are often confronted with the tradeoff between quantity and quality. Especially for a pedagogical corpus, the quality of alignments, annotations and lemmatization is of paramount importance (see Sect. 2.3 ). 2.2.2 Metadata In a pedagogically relevant corpus, each text should be linked to its corresponding metadata. This step is crucial for any type of further exploitation (Paulussen et al. 2013 ). As outlined in the previous section dealing with corpus compilation, we have shown that a text should comply with a set of requirements and Table 1 lists both the general and pedagogically relevant metadata. If each text is linked to a corresponding metadata file that contains the information outlined in Table 1 , the learners or teachers will be able to define a subcorpus that contains only the texts that satisfy their actual needs. Metadata thus make it possible to select a subcorpus consisting of, for instance, intermediate-level journalistic texts, translated from French into Dutch, dealing with economical affairs. Further linguistic queries can then be performed on a specific set of texts. 2.2.3 Analyzing readability A final example of annotation that contributes to the pedagogical enrichment of corpus data, in a somewhat different perspective, is readability and text classifi-cation. In a pedagogical context, it is important to match texts to the proficiency level of the learner and determine the texts X  difficutly level based on, for instance, the criteria of the Common European Framework of Reference . This involves text classification and readability analysis . To evaluate the readability level of a text, one could resort to readability formulas based on linguistic features that are measurable by basic natural language processing techniques, such as sentence length, syntactical complexity, word length, lexical diversity and word frequency counts as well as more complex features such as conceptual density or textual cohesion (cf. Flesch 1948 ; Bormuth 1966 ; Chall and Dale 1995 ). A number of readability formulas are available, and a combination of those formulas may be considered. However, many readability tests are based on English as a native language. In language learning, however, one should also consider language specific measurements, which also address the persistent problems of L2 learners. Recently, formulas have been developed for L2 which focus more on syntactic structures and on collocations (Greenfield 2004 ). Franc  X ois ( 2009 ) and Uitdenbogerd ( 2005 ) proposed formulas for French as a foreign language while Crossley, Greenfield and McNamara ( 2008 ) concentrated on English.
 2.3 Dutch parallel corpus This section presents the DPC, a multilingual and multifunctional parallel corpus for Dutch (pivotal language), French and English. This corpus is used as a starting point for the development of the corpus-based learning activities presented in Sect. 4 .
The corpus comprises more than ten million words and consists of two language pairs (Dutch X  X nglish and Dutch X  X rench) resulting in four translation directions: French into Dutch, Dutch into French, English into Dutch, and Dutch into English. A small part of the corpus is trilingual. In order to obtain a balanced composition, the DPC includes texts pertaining to five different text types, established following Lee X  X  prototype approach (2001) which resulted in a two-level typology including five text types at the superordinate level : literature, journalistic texts, instructive texts, administrative texts, and external communication (De Clercq and Montero Perez 2010 ). Each text type contains approximately 2,000,000 words, with 500,000 words per translation direction. In order to guarantee the quality of the texts, the DPC only included published materials or texts from companies or institutions working with professional translators. All texts included in the DPC are also cleared from copyright. The entire corpus is therefore available for research purposes, a subset can also be used for commercial purposes. 10
The data processing consisted in aligning the texts at sentence level, as well as adding a linguistic annotation layer including lemmatization and PoS tagging. As stated in the previous section, the quality of the data processing is crucial for a pedagogical corpus. Yet, the quality of automatic annotations and alignments is never perfect. In order to deal with this problem, different measures have been taken. On the level of sentence alignment, the output of three different alignment algorithms was combined to minimize the human effort to correct the data, resulting in an overall sentence alignment precision of nearly 100 % on the entire corpus (Macken 2010 ). For less advanced learners who cannot cope with noise in the data, a 1-million-word corpus is available in which each processing step (sentence boundary detection, sentence alignment, PoS tagging and lemmatization) was manually verified. This is crucial for less-experienced learners, who have generally not yet developed the necessary metacognitive skills to deal with problems in the data. On the basis of these manual verifications, the DPC team developed spot-checking and automatic control procedures to verify the 9-million-word corpus. The estimated accuracy of the automatic PoS taggers and lemmatizers was 97.4 % (Dutch and French PoS tagging), 96.5 % (Dutch lemmatization) and 98.1 % (French lemmatization) respectively (Paulussen et al. 2013 ).

Each text included in the corpus is linked to a corresponding metadata file containing information on translation direction, text type, and other text-and translation-related information (i.e. intended audience, text provider, etc.). Thanks to the linguistic annotation and metadata, a web interface could be developed that allows the user to explore a predefined set of corpus texts (e.g. in function of text type and translation direction) and query the corpus for specific linguistic structures. The web interface is a parallel concordancer, developed by the Leuven Language Institute (Montero Perez et al. 2009 ). The interface allows first of all to select a monolingual or a bilingual search and the desired language(s) and translation direction. The interface also offers the user the possibility to specify a text type and a domain (e.g. economy, culture). For each search, users can enter word forms or lemma, define the PoS and indicate the position of the word(s) in the sentence (see Sect. 4.2 ). On the other hand, the monolingual files (the annotated source and target texts) and the sentence alignment files of the DPC corpus have been stored in validated XML files complying with the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) P5 standard. 11 This makes further exploitation and querying relatively easy. Moreover, it also allows programmers to convert the XML files to other formats.

In this section, we tried to identify a number of requirements for constructing a pedagogically relevant corpus. We have also presented the composition and processing of the DPC corpus. In Sect. 3 , we propose a theoretical framework that may help us to answer the question how to use parallel corpora for language learning. 3 How to use parallel corpora for language learning: towards a theoretical framework In literature on corpora and language teaching, references to SLA and the use of a theoretical framework to substantiate the development of concrete language tasks are scarce. Because of the corpus X  capacity to highlight explicit language features, most researchers who have included theoretical perspectives referred to the consciousness raising potential of DDL activities, which get learners to  X  X otice X  (Schmidt 1990 ) particular elements or structures in the input (e.g. Bernardini 2002 ; Chambers 2010 ; Johansson 2009 ; Johns 1997 ). A corpus may also be used in studies adopting a cognition-focused perspective including Krashen X  X  ideas on compre-hensible input (1985). In this context, Gabrielatos ( 2005 : 19) stated that  X  X  X a]lthough it may not be readily apparent, corpus use is also compatible with methodologies that advocate exposure to language, or comprehensible input (Krashen 1985 ), rather than explicit focus on language [ ... ] X  X . Other research articles also stress the importance of producing meaningful output with the help of corpus materials (e.g. Gao 2011 ). Yet, in most studies on corpus-based language teaching and learning, few references to SLA theory have been found.

Within the scope of this article, we will focus on an interactionist SLA account, of which the benefits for CALL design and research have already been underlined by Chapelle ( 2003 , 2005a ). In what follows, we will present that theory and investigate whether its central concepts can substantiate the design of corpus-based CALL activities.

In SLA literature, there is general agreement that all language acquisition starts with input, or put differently, input can be considered  X  X  X he sine qua non for acquisition to take place X  X  (Gass and Mackey 2007 : 177). One of the characteristics of rich input is that it  X  X  X  ... ] include[s] features that prompt learners to notice important aspects of the language X  X  (Chapelle 1998 : 22) and contains options to promote interactions. As a matter of fact, it is generally assumed that language acquisition may be stimulated by a learner X  X  interaction through which he searches to comprehend the meaning of the input or to obtain comprehensible input .

Chapelle ( 2003 ) elaborates the notion of interaction and applies it to the particular domain of CALL by arguing that interaction X  X ased on Ellis X  X  conceptualization ( 1999 ) 12  X  X oes not only take place in a traditional classroom setting where learners interact with their teacher, but also between the learner and the computer. Learner-computer interaction 13 consists then in requesting extra support during the learning session. Following Chapelle ( 1997 : 26): X  X  X  ... ] a good interaction is hypothesized to occur when the normal interactional structure has been modified because the learner has requested, for example, a repetition, clarification or restatement of the original input X  X ; what can be requested is referred to as input enhancement . 14
The next component of the interactionist perspective has to be situated at the output level, i.e. learners X  spoken or written target language (L2) production. Chapelle ( 2003 : 61) stated that for production,  X  X  X he focus is on the potential for learning through the process of attempting to construct grammatical language X  X . As Swain ( 1985 ) advocated, learners should get the opportunity to produce meaningful output. However, while producing output,  X  X  X he learner may get stuck and have to come to grips with unknown grammatical forms X  X  making the learners  X  X  X otice X  X  problems that can, ideally, be solved during the production phase. That is why scaffolding, or supporting the production of comprehensible output seems very important. Swain defined three different functions of output (2005), namely the noticing function, the hypothesis testing function and the metalinguistic (reflective) function. In this paper, we focus on the first two functions whereby the first one refers to the fact that  X  X  X hile attempting to produce the target language [ ... ] learners may notice that they do not know how to say (or write) precisely the meaning they wish to convey X  X  (Swain 2005 : 474). The latter refers to the idea that output may be a  X  X  X  X rial run X  reflecting their hypothesis of how to say (or write) their intent X  X  (Swain 2005 : 476).

Guidance is not only crucial during production, but should also come after production, as feedback on the output. In this context, Takashima proposed the concept of output enhancement , which he used to refer to  X  X  X larification requests that target specific grammatical features X  X  (Doughty and Williams 1998 : 238). Enhanced output consists then in  X  X  X utput that has been  X  X rammaticalized X  as a result of  X  X ushing X  X  X  (Takashima and Ellis 1999 : 174), which leads to the learner X  X  auto-correction while producing speech or text. 4 How to use parallel corpora: two case studies for corpus-based CALL activities In Sect. 2 , we have answered the question  X  X  X hat to use X  X  by describing how a pedagogically relevant corpus could look like. Based on the interactionist SLA model described in Sect. 3 , we focus on  X  X  X ow X  X  a corpus may be used in CALL practice and included in concrete language learning activities. Put differently, we want to illustrate how language learning with corpora can be made possible (as direct corpus application), in order to move beyond learning from corpora (Bernardini 2002 ). In CALL, the main focus is not only on the creation of tools for stimulating language acquisition. Two other concerns are to create environments and tasks which (1) promote interaction and (2) stimulate learner autonomy through working with CALL materials. This is in accordance with Braun ( 2007 : 324) who stated that  X  X  X eachers and materials designers may have to move away from, or beyond  X  X lassic X  concordance-based activities and think of other tasks to foster exploration, knowledge construction and eventually the development of greater autonomy through the use of corpus materials X  X .

In what follows, we will illustrate the potential of a parallel corpus by means of two case studies. In the first one ( see Sect. 4.1 ), we show how the DPC can be used for developing input and input enhancement in a reading comprehension activity. The second case study (see Sect. 4.2 ) illustrates the usefulness of DPC as support for producing meaningful output and providing output enhancements. It is not our objective to present a CALL tool as such, but to reveal the potential and added value of corpus materials in the two contexts. 4.1 Case study 1: comprehensible input and input enhancement in a foreign In the context of CALL-based reading programs (reading tasks on the screen), numerous research studies have focused on the importance of adding enhancements (such as glosses, electronic dictionaries, annotations containing definitions and translations of unknown words, etc.) in order to promote interactions between the learner and the materials and augment content comprehension (see for instance Abraham 2008 , for a meta-analysis on the effects of glosses). Indeed,  X  X  X e should provide learners with comprehensible input rather than just input X  X  (Chapelle 1998 : 9), which is precisely what enhancements do. Empirical CALL studies have not only given evidence to support the effectiveness of electronic enhancements for stimulating reading comprehension, enhancing texts may also lead to vocabulary acquisition (for an overview of these studies see e.g. Abraham 2008 ;Ca  X  rdenas-Claros and Gruba 2009 ;Xu 2010 ). Building on previous research, it can be stated that the availability of enhancements is crucial, not only to promote interaction and increase learning gains but also to support the learner working autonomously in the environment. In what follows, we focus on the potential of a parallel corpus for the development of enhanced reading tasks.

The obvious starting point for any reading comprehension assignment is to find an appropriate reading text. The task presented in this paper suits (high) intermediate learners of French. We selected a parallel text from the DPC by defining the text type (journalistic texts), the domain (communication) and the keyword (technology). The difficulty level of the text is B1, according to the Common European Framework of Reference. As described by those guidelines, learners at the B1-level are required to understand the main ideas of a journal article (Council of Europe 2001 ). The article selected for our case study focuses on technological developments and presents the  X  X  X ouse of the future X  X  (see Fig. 1 ). The text consists of short sentences and the content is assumed to be motivating for intermediate-level language learners.

Figure 1 presents a part of the text in its parallel version, with its general metadata (see Table 1 ) listed in Fig. 2 . In the reading comprehension exercise itself, only the target language text (= French version) is accessible to the learner (see Fig. 3 ). The reading text also contains a number of electronic enhancements.

One of the characteristics of using electronic enhancements is that they may come in many different forms: glosses, annotations containing multimedia material (picture, video, audio), native language translations, target language definitions, etc. However, when using corpus-based text materials, it seems hard to follow the path of existing on-line reading applications, which include multimedia annotations, isolated word translations, or definitions.

The enhancements generated by the DPC corpus can take at least three different forms: sentence translations, monolingual, and bilingual concordances. As shown in Fig. 3 , the corpus-generated enhancements are integrated in the environment through hypertexts that can be activated by clicking on the underlined bold words. The appropriate enhancement is subsequently shown on the screen. Figure 3 (examples 1 X 3) shows the three different types generated by the DPC. Although the three types of enhancements aim at making the message more comprehensible, each enhancement has its own particularities. (1) the corresponding Dutch translation of the sentence containing the target word
It is very likely that the French word la perc X e (the breakthrough) is unknown to the target audience (see Fig. 3 ). It may therefore be appropriate to link that word to the corpus and enhance it with additional information. Figure 3 shows that the word was enhanced by adding the native language (L1) translation. This enhancement subsequently allows the learner to find the translation of the unknown French word la perc X e . 15 Thanks to the enhancement, an initial form-meaning mapping can be installed, i.e. when  X  X  X  learner cognitively registers a form, a meaning, and the fact that the form encodes that meaning in some way X  X  (Van Patten, Williams and Rott 2004 : 5). Because learners X  L1 language is used in the enhancement, they do not need to rely on inferring strategies in order to derive the meaning of the unknown word from context (Liu and Nation 1985 ). We could therefore state that this type of enhancement is the easiest to interpret yet not the best to promote reading comprehension because learners may not only use the L1 enhancement to find the translation of the difficult word but also to understand the entire sentence. (2) a monolingual concordance containing the target word X  X timulating guessing
The second example concerns the collocation se brosser les dents (to brush your teeth). This type of enhancement proposes a L2 monolingual concordance that provides occurrences of the same target word (or combination of words) in another context, as available in the DPC. The monolingual concordance Toilette quotidienne ( se laver le visage, le torse et les mains, se brosser les dent, ... ) 16 is thus another occurrence of the same word combination se brosser les dents . When using monolingual L2 concordances, learners cannot rely on the availability of the L1 and are prompted to infer or guess the meaning from the corpus-generated context. By clicking on the (c) in the concordance, the learner activates the surrounding context of the sentence, which may provide further clarifications. One could raise some doubts towards the rather time-consuming activity of interpreting monolingual concordances in a reading task, when the purpose is primarily to get the meaning. However, as stated by Nation ( 2001 : 232), inferring word meaning through context can be seen as one of the most important sources of vocabulary acquisition in native language and claims that  X  X  X t should also be true for second language learners, but many do not experience the conditions that are needed for this kind of learning to occur X  X . Successful guessing or inferring correct word meaning relies on a number of factors. One of those factors is that learners tend to use clues for guessing. In our example, we can say that the additional concordance contains a  X  X  X ontextual clue X  X  (Nation 2001 : 242) i.e. toilette quotidienne (daily cleansing). In addition, providing the learner with monolingual concordances seems to fit particularly well with the idea of  X  X  X v]ariability of contexts. The more different the contexts in which a word recurs the greater the range of clues available X  X  and the  X  X  X p]resence of relevant clues X  X  (Nation 2001 : 243 X 244). (3) a parallel concordance containing the target word and the corresponding L1
The third type consists of a set of parallel concordances that contain  X  X  X exts in one language aligned with their translation into one or more languages X  X  (Frankenberg-Garc X   X  a 2005 : 190). The French word exc X dentaire is hyperlinked to parallel concordances (see Fig. 3 ), which show that the target word should be translated as overtollig or overmatig (superfluous). Although parallel corpora are mostly associated with translation studies and contrastive linguistics (see Sect. 1 ), their use may also be particularly valuable as a reading enhancement. The way they are used here is X  X lthough purely receptive X  X imilar to a contextualized dictionary which helps the user to get the meaning:  X  X  X w]hat a parallel text provides is, effectively, an on-line contextualized dictionary which language learners can exploit X  X  (Barlow 2000 : 114). We could also say that parallel concordances not only present the advantages of L1 translations but also those of target language concordances. Parallel concordances might therefore contribute to successful form-meaning mappings during enhanced reading tasks. (4) Focus on Form in a meaning-focused task
As shown in Fig. 3 , we also added a fourth type of enhancement (4). This enhancement illustrates the possibility to provide not only vocabulary information (as is usually the case in meaning-focused tasks) but also grammatical enrichments. The fourth example can be considered an illustration of what is called a planned Focus on Form (FonF), which consists in drawing learners X  attention to predefined linguistic items in a meaning-focused task (Leowen 2011 ). The corpus-generated enhancements may thus not only support deficient vocabulary knowledge but may also prompt learners to notice particular structural or grammatical elements that tend to cause problems. It can, for instance, be particularly interesting to highlight contrastive problems. Example (4) (see Fig. 3 ) refers to a lexico-grammatical problem and concerns the construction of the verb to wait : French: attendre  X  Dutch: wachten . When analyzing the sentence and the additional parallel concordances we notice that the verb attendre does not need a preposition to introduce the complement (see Table 2 ). In both English and Dutch, the valency pattern of the verb does contain a preposition, which may therefore lead to erroneous literal translations in learner speech and texts.

To sum up, in this first case study, the reading text as well as the additional enhancements were generated by the corpus. Together, they represent a corpus-based online reading task. In order to obtain the appropriate information, the learner clicks on the hypertext and performs an interactional modification. He does not need to browse through the corpus himself as would be the case when using a web interface or a traditional or electronic dictionary. Although the corpus could also be used as a search tool (i.e. reference resource) during reading, the integrated approach seems particularly beneficial as it can help learners to engage more with the reading process. However, although no tool switching or additional tool activation is necessary, it is still the learner who decides whether or not he  X  X  X ctivates X  X  enhancements. 4.2 Case study 2: comprehensible output and output enhancement in a writing The second case study describes the potential of a parallel corpus for assisting learners X  production of meaningful output. As outlined in the theoretical section of this paper, learners may notice gaps in their L2 knowledge which might prevent them from producing a particular structure or lexical item correctly. The idea of providing assistance to learners while writing texts seems thus crucial and has been at the basis of the development of a number of CALL writing aids. Hegelheimer ( 2006 : 5) advocated that  X  X  X c]urrent approaches to language pedagogy recognize the fact that ESL learners need explicit help to improve the grammatical accuracy of their writing X  X . Both lexical and grammatical help have been researched in order to stimulate L2 learners X  production of meaningful output. Online dictionaries were studied by, for instance, Kaur and Hegelheimer ( 2005 ) and Bland et al. ( 1990 ). Corpus-based grammar resources were studied by Hegelheimer ( 2006 ). Other studies using corpora for writing tasks have focused on its use as a reference resource during the revision process. These studies (e.g. Kennedy and Miceli 2010 ; O X  X ullivan and Chambers 2006 ) focused on how learners looked up particular aspects in the corpus and subsequently used that information to correct their texts. Because the abovementioned studies were based on monolingual corpora, an important limitation was related to the fact that learners based their search often on the incorrect word or structure. Because this search did not produce useful results and because learners were unaware of similar L2 words or structures, they were unable to use the corpus effectively for error correction (O X  X ullivan and Chambers 2006 ). One way to deal with this limitation is to look at the possibilities of a parallel corpus, which allows the learner to rely on his native language whenever necessary. In what follows, we study the use of a parallel corpus as a grammatical and lexical resource, which serves as an aid to produce meaningful output. In order to be able to use a corpus as a reference resource, two requirements should be fulfilled (Peters et al. 2000 : 74):  X  X (1) a high quality corpus, sufficiently representative of the object it aims at modeling (whether the entire lexicon or particular sub-sets of it), and large enough to provide a sufficient number of valid data samples, must be available; (2) easy to use, flexible access, query and analysis procedures must be implemented X  X . Considering those requirements, we believe the DPC is particularly appropriate as it does not only consist of high-quality translations but is also easily accessible through a user-friendly web interface (see Sect. 2.3 ).

In this case study, we will illustrate how the corpus may answer learners X  (a) lexical and (b) grammatical questions and assist them at points where traditional resources such as bilingual dictionaries and learner grammars present shortcomings. Yet, we should also point out that learners need to be provided with exploratory tasks dealing with the concrete use of the web interface, before using the corpus during output production. In what follows, we present two examples, which focus on Dutch-speaking learners of French. (a) Parallel corpus versus bilingual dictionary
Finding an adequate translation of a word or a multiword unit is one of the major difficulties that language learners face while producing target language text. This problem is especially annoying when the bilingual dictionary does not provide a clear context. In case of polysemous words, for example, students may produce a semantically incorrect sentence because the information provided by the reference resource lacks additional context. For instance, when a learner looks up the Dutch word bedrijf (a company), the bilingual dictionary (e.g. Van Dale Lexicografie 2002 ) proposes three translations : enterprise, acte, and fonctionnement. If we are referring to a company, only the first translation entreprise is correct. In other contexts, the bilingual dictionary only proposes one possible translation, although multiple words or structures could be used. Whereas bilingual dictionaries present shortcomings, the validity of using parallel corpora for word sense disambiguation (i.e. the selection of the correct translation of a polysemous word in a given context) is widely accepted in the NLP (Natural Language Processing) community (Ide et al. 2002 ; Lefever et al. 2011 ). In addition, parallel corpora have also been defined as a  X  X  X ontextualized bilingual dictionary X  X  (Barlow 2000 ), Dickens and Salkie ( 1996 : 553) proposed the notion of  X  X  X ich translation equivalence X  X , which refers to  X  X  X t]he wider range of strategies that the corpus shows up X  X .

In order to illustrate the idea of rich translation equivalence by means of a concrete example taken from the DPC, we use the Dutch structure beter gezegd ( or rather ). A literal translation into French is excluded, the bilingual dictionary (Van Dale Lexicografie 2002 ) offers one possibility plus pr X cis X ment . We enter a search query in the web interface by selecting a bilingual search (Dutch X  X rench) as shown in Fig. 4 . To search the corpus (see Fig. 4 ), we enter two search words: beter in box A and gezegd in box B, we also indicate that there cannot be another word between the two search words (box C).

A quick search in the DPC corpus shows that there are at least two other possibilities: mieux and plus exactement (see Fig. 5 ) and confirms the potential of a parallel corpus as a rich translation resource. (b) Parallel corpus as grammar resource
When analyzing learner texts, a number of grammatical specificities seem to cause recurring errors. In her error tagging system of learner texts, Granger ( 2003 : 468) distinguished different grammatical error categories: class, auxiliary, gender, mode, number, person, tense, voice and euphony. A lot of these errors can be corrected by looking up information in a dictionary, learner grammars or via monolingual searches in a corpus. However, one of the fundamental difficulties in writing assignments concerns the fact that learners often tend to rely too much on their mother tongue. This mostly leads to incorrect literal translations of the L1 sentence. Although problematic, these issues are very often ignored in typical learner grammars. This is the case for grammatical structures that occur in one language but not in another. One of the typical constrastive difficulties for Dutch speaking learners of French is the use of the nominalized infinitive (NI) (van Baardewijk-Resse  X  guier and van Willigen-Sinemus 1989 ). Both learner grammars and dictionaries do not provide support for dealing with the NI since that structure does not exist in French. In Dutch, however, every verb can be transformed into a NI by adding a definite article (see Table 3 ). The NI structure can act as subject or complement in the sentence (see examples in Fig. 6 ).

The purpose of our search is to identify as many structures as possible in order to find out which strategies are used to translate the typical Dutch structure into French. We perform a bilingual search on the entire corpus and enter the definite article  X  X  X et X  X  in the first search box and indicate that the word in the second box should be a verb, more precisely an infinitive (see Fig. 4 box A and B). There cannot be another word between the two search words as to minimize the amount of noise in the results (Fig. 4 box C). We perform the search on the entire corpus, which means that we also search in texts that are not necessarily pedagogically relevant, 17 but may contain interesting examples. We tick off the box random hits to retrieve different results each time we search the corpus (only 100 results are shown at once). The search returned 5489 results, which reveal not only different strategies to translate the NI into French but also illustrate the notion of  X  X  X ich translation equivalence X  X  from a grammatical point of view (Dickens and Salkie 1996 : 553). As shown in Fig. 6 (examples 2, 3, 5, and 6), one of the most frequent translation strategies is to use a deverbative noun. Other strategies are to translate the NI by means of an infinitive verb (1) or the structure le fait de/que (4) 18 (see Fig. 6 ).
Although the use of a corpus may prevent learners from making errors during production, appropriate error correction or feedback remains crucial. The use of output enhancement (Takashima and Ellis 1999 ), which may  X  X  X ush X  X  the learner to modify the original sentence in order to write a more correct utterance, seems therefore important. Output enhancement may also be corpus-based and include of an annotated version of the learner text, containing corpus-based hints to revise and modify the original output. An interesting scenario could be to identify problematic structures or words, based on a series of NLP techniques and provide the learners with the corresponding corpus-based enhancements, leading to noticing and correction of the erroneous utterance. 5 Conclusions and future research The main objective of this paper was to show the value of a parallel corpus for the development of enriched CALL activities that stimulate interactions and foster autonomy.
 We first enumerated the basic prerequisites of a pedagogically relevant corpus. Based on findings in literature on corpus compilation and processing, we proposed a series of compilation requirements and explained the (pedagogical) usefulness of different processing layers. We then showed how the interactionist approach can substantiate the design of corpus-based CALL activities and presented two case studies: a receptive reading comprehension task and a productive writing assignment. The reference corpus for the concrete development of our case studies was the DPC.

Schematically, we could represent the theoretical underpinnings of our case studies as follows:
The framework in Fig. 7 shows that the corpus is at the basis of the two language tasks: it provides the enhancements and serves as a reference resource for linguistic production. The corpus is represented by the ellipse form and includes the input and the enhancements. The corpus can also be seen as a reference resource. The learner occupies a central position, located outside the corpus, and is in control of possible interactions with the input (for obtaining comprehensible input) or with the corpus for producing comprehensible output. The eventual output (be it written or spoken) is located outside the corpus as this is the learners X  outcome, based on inside interactions between corpus data, the task, and the learner.

The main limitation of this study concerns the absence of experimental evaluation of the two case studies presented. The case studies do, however, present a number of interesting future research tracks for validating the potential of parallel corpora in CALL and the use of an interactionist framework for sustaining the development of corpus-based CALL activities. The first case study could be at the basis of an experiment focusing on L2 reading comprehension. Research questions may be asked with respect to the effectiveness of the different enhancements presented in the first case study for enhancing L2 learners X  comprehension. Research could also focus on the use of grammar prompts and their effects on learners X  retention of the enhanced structures. The second experimental study could focus on how learners actually use the parallel corpus during a productive task. Research questions may be asked with respect to the type of information looked up by the learners (e.g. grammatical structures, lexical items, translation, etc.) and study the effect of look-ups on output production and correction. The study could involve learners from different proficiency levels in order to gain more insight into the benefits of a parallel corpus for learners of different proficiencies.

In general, we hope to have illustrated that a parallel corpus can be much more than a translation resource, it may be an engaging reference resource for a variety of language tasks aiming at stimulating different learning goals and outcomes.

 Abstract The aim of this paper is to illustrate the potential of a parallel corpus in the context of (computer-assisted) language learning. In order to do so, we propose to answer two main questions (1) what corpus (data) to use and (2) how to use the corpus (data). We provide an answer to the what-question by describing the importance and particularities of compiling and processing a corpus for pedagogical purposes. In order to answer the how-question, we first investigate the central concepts of the interactionist theory of second language acquisition: comprehensible input, input enhancement, comprehensible output and output enhancement. By means of two case studies, we illustrate how the abovementioned concepts can be realized in concrete corpus-based language learning activities. We propose a design for a receptive and productive language task and describe how a parallel corpus can be at the basis of powerful language learning activities. The Dutch Parallel Corpus, a ten-million word sentence aligned and annotated parallel corpus, is used to develop these language tasks.
 Keywords Parallel corpus Interactionist theory CALL Corpus CALL Data driven learning Language teaching/learning 1 Introduction: the use of corpora in (computer-assisted) language learning The overall availability of corpora has facilitated access to corpus materials for a wide range of users, with different (linguistic) backgrounds, using corpora for diverse exploitation purposes. 1 While a lot of corpus research has focused on either descriptive grammatical or lexical issues in monolingual or multilingual corpora, an important amount of literature can also be found on the value of using corpora in language pedagogy. Although the influence of corpus-based research on language teaching in the actual language classroom still remains rather limited (Tribble 2000 ; Cheng 2010 ), there is consensus among researchers that the use of corpora for language learning 2 in general as well as more specifically for computer-assisted language learning (CALL) has brought forth a  X  X  X orpus revolution X  X  3 (Mukherjee 2006 : 5).

Following Leech ( 1997 ), 4 Ro  X  mer (2008 X 2009), and McEnery and Xiao ( 2011 ), we can distinguish two major types of corpus use 5 in the context of language teaching and pedagogy i.e. indirect and direct applications. As described by Ro  X  mer (2008 X 2009), indirect corpus applications use corpus materials for linguistic descriptions, which can serve as a valuable resource for the development and elaboration of corpus-based course materials. McEnery and Xiao ( 2011 ) also noted that corpora have been mainly used indirectly in language teaching and learning. One of the frequently cited examples in this context (e.g. Cheng 2010 ; Mukherjee 2006 ; Nesselhauf 2004 ; Yoon 2008 ) is the Collins COBUILD Language Database (Sinclair 1987 ),  X  X  X he first corpus-based dictionary X  X  (Mukherjee 2006 : 7), which was developed to  X  X  X pply results from native speaker corpus analyses to the improvement of pedagogic material X  X  (Nesselhauf 2004 : 126). Besides corpus-based developments in the field of lexicography (e.g. the Routledge series of Frequency dictionaries), the availability of corpora gave rise to a series of corpus-based reference works such as text books and grammars (e.g. Carter and McCarthy 2006 ; Hunston and Francis 1998 ), which introduced corpora X  X e it indirectly X  X n the classroom.

Direct applications , on the other hand, put the emphasis on the interaction between the learner/teacher and the actual corpus materials. This approach has also been labeled data driven learning (DDL) (Johns 1991 ), which basically refers to an inductive bottom-up approach of language learning whereby learners act as actual language researchers by observing and exploring text samples in order to discover certain patterns of use, meanings, etc. Text samples used in a DDL approach are very often concordances 6 (i.e. a list of occurrences of a keyword, word combination, etc. in a context 7 based on a particular corpus). The use of monolingual concordances for the inductive approach has possibly been one of the most important starting points for DDL research (Flowerdew 1996 ; Frankenberg-Garc X   X  a 2005 ; Granath 2009 ). On the other hand, text samples taken from learner corpora, which consist of texts  X  X  X roduced by non-native speakers of the language X  X  (Gilquin and Granger 2010 : 361), 8 are often used by teachers in order to draw attention to difficult contrastive problems. Parallel corpora, which consist  X  X  X f a set of texts in language A and their translations in language B X  X  (Kenning 2010 : 487) and their parallel concordances (occurrences in both language A and language B) have been studied less frequently in a pedagogical context (Frankenberg-Garc X   X  a 2003 ) although containing at least as much X  X f not more X  X otential for language learning as monolingual concordances. However, when studying literature on the use of parallel corpora for language learning, we notice that its value is often underes-timated. References to parallel corpora and its concordances often only stress their interest and importance for translation studies (Ro  X  mer 2008  X 2009; Gao 2011 )or conceive their use as a more traditional approach:  X  X (a)s translation has always been a focal point in language education in Japan, it (use of parallel concordances) fits nicely into this traditional way of looking at languages X  X  (Szirmai 2002 :101). Still, a number of experimental studies have proven the interest of using parallel corpora and concordances in language learning. Gao ( 2011 ) illustrated how higher intermediate learners of English, conducting a target language (L2) writing task, were able to X  X utonomously X  X orrect their tasks with the help of parallel concordances. The study of St.John ( 2001 ) demonstrated that parallel concordances may also have beneficial effects for beginner-level students as they may help the learners with lexical issues during task performance. This experimental study supports the ideas of Barlow ( 1996 , 2000 ) who claimed that parallel texts are valuable as an  X  X  X n-line contextualized bilingual dictionary X  X . A similar idea was presented by Dickens and Salkie ( 1996 ), who made a distinction between the  X  X  X asic translation equivalence X  X  (as in dictionary translations) and  X  X  X ich translation equivalence X  X  given by the parallel corpus. Other studies described the use of parallel texts 9 with explicit pedagogical uses (Frankenberg-Garc X   X  a 2005 ; Lixun 2001 ). Frankenberg-Garc X   X  a( 2005 ) illustrated how parallel concordances may be used for receptive tasks, language correction, language exercises and testing. In his paper, Nerbonne ( 2000 ) stressed the importance of parallel texts for CALL and underlined the need to process and align the parallel texts in order to make them valuable for applications.

Based on our (non-exhaustive) literature review, we may advocate that the concrete use of parallel corpora in CALL deserves more in-depth research. That is why the present study aims at investigating the opportunities and possible exploitations of a parallel corpus in the context of CALL by moving beyond the mere use of ready-made parallel concordances.

Our paper is structured as follows: in the next part (see Sect. 2 ), we will answer the question what corpus to use. We focus on the requirements that should be met when compiling a pedagogically relevant parallel corpus (see Sect. 2.1 ), consider the types of pedagogical processing of the content (see Sect. 2.2 ), and present the Dutch Parallel Corpus (DPC) (Paulussen et al. 2013 ) (see Sect. 2.3 ). In Sect. 3 , we present the main concepts of the interactionist Second Language Acquisition (SLA) theory and their potential value for corpus-based CALL activities. We will focus on the concepts of comprehensible input, input enhancement, comprehensible output and output enhancement. In the fourth part (see Sect. 4 ), we will illustrate how each of these components may be realized by means of two different case studies. The corpus-based comprehensible input and input enhancement will be illustrated by means of a CALL reading task ( see Sect. 4.1 ). A case study on the use of corpora for writing will illustrate its potential for supporting the production of comprehensible output and the creation of opportunities for output enhancement (see Sect. 4.2 ). The aim of both case studies is not to present a corpus-based ready-made software application but rather a conceptual framework, which may substantiate the design of concrete language tasks. 2 What corpus to work with? Compiling and processing a pedagogically relevant corpus It has been claimed that corpora can only be used effectively in the language classroom if a number of prerequisites are met (Gabrielatos 2005 ). This part will outline a number of corpus-related requirements at the level of corpus compilation (see Sect. 2.1 ) and corpus processing (see Sect. 2.2 ) and present the DPC (see Sect. 2.3 ). 2.1 Corpus compilation One of the important issues in a corpus-based approach to language teaching concerns the design and compilation of a pedagogically relevant corpus. Thus, not every corpus is suited for classroom or learning purposes. In fact, there is a strong  X  X  X eed for pedagogically motivated corpus content [which] is well reflected in the many initiatives in tertiary education to create small  X  X ome-made X  or  X  X d-hoc X  corpora which contain similar texts and are more coherent than traditional corpora X  X  (Braun 2007 : 308). From what we described above, it is clear that corpus compilation is a crucial yet very delicate issue in language pedagogy. Mishan ( 2004 ) advocated that one of the basic assumptions concerns the fact that corpus materials are authentic. Whereas the use of corpora has often been described as  X  X  X uthenticity X  X  in the classroom (Ackerley and Coccetta 2007 ; Gilquin and Granger 2010 ; Nerbonne 2000 ; etc.), it has also been claimed that corpus texts are not  X  X  X he real language X  X  (Gavioli 2005 : 18). However, in the context of language teaching and learning, the notion of  X  X uthenticity X  can become problematic. In this perspective, a frequently cited researcher is Widdowson (see e.g. Ackerley and Coccetta 2007 ; Braun 2005 ; Gilquin and Granger 2010 ; Mishan 2004 ) whose views on authenticity have played an important role in the conceptualization of what constitutes a pedagogically relevant corpus. Widdowson questioned the concept of authenticity and distinguished between text production and text reception (Widdowson 2000 ). It is on the level of text reception (learner reading/using the text) that the relationship between the learner and the text becomes problematic as the latter lacks authenticity :  X  X  X t]he language cannot be authentic because the classroom cannot provide the contextual conditions for it to be authenticated by the learners X  X  (Widdowson 1998 : 171). The learner is said to have problems to engage with the text, which makes the authentic character disappear. More precisely, when learners receive texts from a corpus, the text has to be seen in its wider context. Because this context is often not available, it becomes impossible for the learner to engage with the text.

In order to tackle the issue of authenticity, Gilquin and Granger ( 2010 ) proposed several solutions. One of those solutions may be to compile a pedagogic corpus that  X  X  X elp[s] learners  X  X uthenticate X  X  X (Widdowson 2003 as cited by Gilquin and Granger 2010 : 360). The compilation of a pedagogic corpus consists of three major phases: corpus design, text collection and preparation (Kenning 2010 ). When compiling a pedagogical corpus, we can state that the corpus design should consist of two types of requirements: the specific pedagogical criteria and the general corpus require-ments (see Table 1 ).

The pedagogical requirements concern first of all the type of content included in the corpus: is the content motivating and interesting for the target audience? Are the materials in accordance with the pedagogical needs (Braun 2006 ) or put differently, is it possible for learners to  X  X uthenticate X  with the included corpus materials? Each text should subsequently be accompanied by a set of pedagogically relevant metadata that make it possible to easily exploit the texts through any type of interface (e.g. embedded in a CALL application). Important metadata are the difficulty level (e.g. following the Common European Framework of Reference, Council of Europe 2001 ) of the text. For each text, a theme and domain can be added. Additionally, each text receives a keyword and the presence of (technical) jargon (e.g. economic texts may contain a lot of financial terminology) may also be determined as that often influences the difficulty level of the text.

On the other hand, some general requirements have to be included. By  X  X  X eneral X  X , we mean that the requirements are not specifically pedagogical. General require-ments may thus be applicable to any type of corpus, irrespective of the concrete exploitation objectives. For parallel corpora, the most important requirements are the quality of the texts and their translations. The idea of balanced corpus content is important and can be found at the level of the text types and the translation directions. The criteria are summarized in Table 1 .

The next phase consists in finding texts that are in accordance with the established set of requirements and specifications and for which high quality text providers should be contacted in order to obtain the actual texts and clear copyright issues (De Clercq and Montero Perez 2010 ). 2.2 Corpus processing Compiling a pedagogical corpus does not only consist in finding suitable texts. Corpus data need to be processed in order to augment their pedagogical exploitation potential. In this section, we describe the importance of three processing stages, which transform raw corpus data into enriched exploitable texts (see Sect. 4 ). 2.2.1 Annotating and aligning texts As was pointed out by Braun ( 2005 : 54):  X  X  X he major task of the annotation is to support pedagogically motivated corpus queries X  X . Annotation is a preliminary step for any form of exploitation, since you can only get information out of a text in as far you have stored information into the text. Annotation requires segmentation of a text into words and sentences before lemmatizing and adding part-of-speech (PoS) tags. First of all, if texts are linguistically annotated, the user can carry out a linguistic search on the corpus, for example to use the corpus as a reference resource (see case study 2, Sect. 4 ). Learners can look up a specific structure and define the PoS (e.g. the verb consist and the preposition of) but they can also formulate a more abstract query search such as the sequence VERB PREP NOUN. The lemmatization is crucial for learners who want to look up different word forms that pertain to one lemma. By searching on a lemma, results will contain more occurrences of, for instance, a verb than a search on an exact word form and can therefore provide more interesting information.

The alignment on paragraph and/or sentence level is another crucial aspect of the data processing in a pedagogical context (Nerbonne 2000 ) and is also indispensable to provide parallel concordances. Its value for L2 learners lies precisely in the fact that the smaller the unit (paragraph or sentence) in which the queried structure can be found, the easier they will deal with the input and retrieve the desired information. The importance of sentence-aligned concordances will be illustrated in both case studies (see Sect. 4 ) by means of different examples.

It should be noted that the processing steps are fully automatic and corpus builders are often confronted with the tradeoff between quantity and quality. Especially for a pedagogical corpus, the quality of alignments, annotations and lemmatization is of paramount importance (see Sect. 2.3 ). 2.2.2 Metadata In a pedagogically relevant corpus, each text should be linked to its corresponding metadata. This step is crucial for any type of further exploitation (Paulussen et al. 2013 ). As outlined in the previous section dealing with corpus compilation, we have shown that a text should comply with a set of requirements and Table 1 lists both the general and pedagogically relevant metadata. If each text is linked to a corresponding metadata file that contains the information outlined in Table 1 , the learners or teachers will be able to define a subcorpus that contains only the texts that satisfy their actual needs. Metadata thus make it possible to select a subcorpus consisting of, for instance, intermediate-level journalistic texts, translated from French into Dutch, dealing with economical affairs. Further linguistic queries can then be performed on a specific set of texts. 2.2.3 Analyzing readability A final example of annotation that contributes to the pedagogical enrichment of corpus data, in a somewhat different perspective, is readability and text classifi-cation. In a pedagogical context, it is important to match texts to the proficiency level of the learner and determine the texts X  difficutly level based on, for instance, the criteria of the Common European Framework of Reference . This involves text classification and readability analysis . To evaluate the readability level of a text, one could resort to readability formulas based on linguistic features that are measurable by basic natural language processing techniques, such as sentence length, syntactical complexity, word length, lexical diversity and word frequency counts as well as more complex features such as conceptual density or textual cohesion (cf. Flesch 1948 ; Bormuth 1966 ; Chall and Dale 1995 ). A number of readability formulas are available, and a combination of those formulas may be considered. However, many readability tests are based on English as a native language. In language learning, however, one should also consider language specific measurements, which also address the persistent problems of L2 learners. Recently, formulas have been developed for L2 which focus more on syntactic structures and on collocations (Greenfield 2004 ). Franc  X ois ( 2009 ) and Uitdenbogerd ( 2005 ) proposed formulas for French as a foreign language while Crossley, Greenfield and McNamara ( 2008 ) concentrated on English.
 2.3 Dutch parallel corpus This section presents the DPC, a multilingual and multifunctional parallel corpus for Dutch (pivotal language), French and English. This corpus is used as a starting point for the development of the corpus-based learning activities presented in Sect. 4 .
The corpus comprises more than ten million words and consists of two language pairs (Dutch X  X nglish and Dutch X  X rench) resulting in four translation directions: French into Dutch, Dutch into French, English into Dutch, and Dutch into English. A small part of the corpus is trilingual. In order to obtain a balanced composition, the DPC includes texts pertaining to five different text types, established following Lee X  X  prototype approach (2001) which resulted in a two-level typology including five text types at the superordinate level : literature, journalistic texts, instructive texts, administrative texts, and external communication (De Clercq and Montero Perez 2010 ). Each text type contains approximately 2,000,000 words, with 500,000 words per translation direction. In order to guarantee the quality of the texts, the DPC only included published materials or texts from companies or institutions working with professional translators. All texts included in the DPC are also cleared from copyright. The entire corpus is therefore available for research purposes, a subset can also be used for commercial purposes. 10
The data processing consisted in aligning the texts at sentence level, as well as adding a linguistic annotation layer including lemmatization and PoS tagging. As stated in the previous section, the quality of the data processing is crucial for a pedagogical corpus. Yet, the quality of automatic annotations and alignments is never perfect. In order to deal with this problem, different measures have been taken. On the level of sentence alignment, the output of three different alignment algorithms was combined to minimize the human effort to correct the data, resulting in an overall sentence alignment precision of nearly 100 % on the entire corpus (Macken 2010 ). For less advanced learners who cannot cope with noise in the data, a 1-million-word corpus is available in which each processing step (sentence boundary detection, sentence alignment, PoS tagging and lemmatization) was manually verified. This is crucial for less-experienced learners, who have generally not yet developed the necessary metacognitive skills to deal with problems in the data. On the basis of these manual verifications, the DPC team developed spot-checking and automatic control procedures to verify the 9-million-word corpus. The estimated accuracy of the automatic PoS taggers and lemmatizers was 97.4 % (Dutch and French PoS tagging), 96.5 % (Dutch lemmatization) and 98.1 % (French lemmatization) respectively (Paulussen et al. 2013 ).

Each text included in the corpus is linked to a corresponding metadata file containing information on translation direction, text type, and other text-and translation-related information (i.e. intended audience, text provider, etc.). Thanks to the linguistic annotation and metadata, a web interface could be developed that allows the user to explore a predefined set of corpus texts (e.g. in function of text type and translation direction) and query the corpus for specific linguistic structures. The web interface is a parallel concordancer, developed by the Leuven Language Institute (Montero Perez et al. 2009 ). The interface allows first of all to select a monolingual or a bilingual search and the desired language(s) and translation direction. The interface also offers the user the possibility to specify a text type and a domain (e.g. economy, culture). For each search, users can enter word forms or lemma, define the PoS and indicate the position of the word(s) in the sentence (see Sect. 4.2 ). On the other hand, the monolingual files (the annotated source and target texts) and the sentence alignment files of the DPC corpus have been stored in validated XML files complying with the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) P5 standard. 11 This makes further exploitation and querying relatively easy. Moreover, it also allows programmers to convert the XML files to other formats.

In this section, we tried to identify a number of requirements for constructing a pedagogically relevant corpus. We have also presented the composition and processing of the DPC corpus. In Sect. 3 , we propose a theoretical framework that may help us to answer the question how to use parallel corpora for language learning. 3 How to use parallel corpora for language learning: towards a theoretical framework In literature on corpora and language teaching, references to SLA and the use of a theoretical framework to substantiate the development of concrete language tasks are scarce. Because of the corpus X  capacity to highlight explicit language features, most researchers who have included theoretical perspectives referred to the consciousness raising potential of DDL activities, which get learners to  X  X otice X  (Schmidt 1990 ) particular elements or structures in the input (e.g. Bernardini 2002 ; Chambers 2010 ; Johansson 2009 ; Johns 1997 ). A corpus may also be used in studies adopting a cognition-focused perspective including Krashen X  X  ideas on compre-hensible input (1985). In this context, Gabrielatos ( 2005 : 19) stated that  X  X  X a]lthough it may not be readily apparent, corpus use is also compatible with methodologies that advocate exposure to language, or comprehensible input (Krashen 1985 ), rather than explicit focus on language [ ... ] X  X . Other research articles also stress the importance of producing meaningful output with the help of corpus materials (e.g. Gao 2011 ). Yet, in most studies on corpus-based language teaching and learning, few references to SLA theory have been found.

Within the scope of this article, we will focus on an interactionist SLA account, of which the benefits for CALL design and research have already been underlined by Chapelle ( 2003 , 2005a ). In what follows, we will present that theory and investigate whether its central concepts can substantiate the design of corpus-based CALL activities.

In SLA literature, there is general agreement that all language acquisition starts with input, or put differently, input can be considered  X  X  X he sine qua non for acquisition to take place X  X  (Gass and Mackey 2007 : 177). One of the characteristics of rich input is that it  X  X  X  ... ] include[s] features that prompt learners to notice important aspects of the language X  X  (Chapelle 1998 : 22) and contains options to promote interactions. As a matter of fact, it is generally assumed that language acquisition may be stimulated by a learner X  X  interaction through which he searches to comprehend the meaning of the input or to obtain comprehensible input .

Chapelle ( 2003 ) elaborates the notion of interaction and applies it to the particular domain of CALL by arguing that interaction X  X ased on Ellis X  X  conceptualization ( 1999 ) 12  X  X oes not only take place in a traditional classroom setting where learners interact with their teacher, but also between the learner and the computer. Learner-computer interaction 13 consists then in requesting extra support during the learning session. Following Chapelle ( 1997 : 26): X  X  X  ... ] a good interaction is hypothesized to occur when the normal interactional structure has been modified because the learner has requested, for example, a repetition, clarification or restatement of the original input X  X ; what can be requested is referred to as input enhancement . 14
The next component of the interactionist perspective has to be situated at the output level, i.e. learners X  spoken or written target language (L2) production. Chapelle ( 2003 : 61) stated that for production,  X  X  X he focus is on the potential for learning through the process of attempting to construct grammatical language X  X . As Swain ( 1985 ) advocated, learners should get the opportunity to produce meaningful output. However, while producing output,  X  X  X he learner may get stuck and have to come to grips with unknown grammatical forms X  X  making the learners  X  X  X otice X  X  problems that can, ideally, be solved during the production phase. That is why scaffolding, or supporting the production of comprehensible output seems very important. Swain defined three different functions of output (2005), namely the noticing function, the hypothesis testing function and the metalinguistic (reflective) function. In this paper, we focus on the first two functions whereby the first one refers to the fact that  X  X  X hile attempting to produce the target language [ ... ] learners may notice that they do not know how to say (or write) precisely the meaning they wish to convey X  X  (Swain 2005 : 474). The latter refers to the idea that output may be a  X  X  X  X rial run X  reflecting their hypothesis of how to say (or write) their intent X  X  (Swain 2005 : 476).

Guidance is not only crucial during production, but should also come after production, as feedback on the output. In this context, Takashima proposed the concept of output enhancement , which he used to refer to  X  X  X larification requests that target specific grammatical features X  X  (Doughty and Williams 1998 : 238). Enhanced output consists then in  X  X  X utput that has been  X  X rammaticalized X  as a result of  X  X ushing X  X  X  (Takashima and Ellis 1999 : 174), which leads to the learner X  X  auto-correction while producing speech or text. 4 How to use parallel corpora: two case studies for corpus-based CALL activities In Sect. 2 , we have answered the question  X  X  X hat to use X  X  by describing how a pedagogically relevant corpus could look like. Based on the interactionist SLA model described in Sect. 3 , we focus on  X  X  X ow X  X  a corpus may be used in CALL practice and included in concrete language learning activities. Put differently, we want to illustrate how language learning with corpora can be made possible (as direct corpus application), in order to move beyond learning from corpora (Bernardini 2002 ). In CALL, the main focus is not only on the creation of tools for stimulating language acquisition. Two other concerns are to create environments and tasks which (1) promote interaction and (2) stimulate learner autonomy through working with CALL materials. This is in accordance with Braun ( 2007 : 324) who stated that  X  X  X eachers and materials designers may have to move away from, or beyond  X  X lassic X  concordance-based activities and think of other tasks to foster exploration, knowledge construction and eventually the development of greater autonomy through the use of corpus materials X  X .

In what follows, we will illustrate the potential of a parallel corpus by means of two case studies. In the first one ( see Sect. 4.1 ), we show how the DPC can be used for developing input and input enhancement in a reading comprehension activity. The second case study (see Sect. 4.2 ) illustrates the usefulness of DPC as support for producing meaningful output and providing output enhancements. It is not our objective to present a CALL tool as such, but to reveal the potential and added value of corpus materials in the two contexts. 4.1 Case study 1: comprehensible input and input enhancement in a foreign In the context of CALL-based reading programs (reading tasks on the screen), numerous research studies have focused on the importance of adding enhancements (such as glosses, electronic dictionaries, annotations containing definitions and translations of unknown words, etc.) in order to promote interactions between the learner and the materials and augment content comprehension (see for instance Abraham 2008 , for a meta-analysis on the effects of glosses). Indeed,  X  X  X e should provide learners with comprehensible input rather than just input X  X  (Chapelle 1998 : 9), which is precisely what enhancements do. Empirical CALL studies have not only given evidence to support the effectiveness of electronic enhancements for stimulating reading comprehension, enhancing texts may also lead to vocabulary acquisition (for an overview of these studies see e.g. Abraham 2008 ;Ca  X  rdenas-Claros and Gruba 2009 ;Xu 2010 ). Building on previous research, it can be stated that the availability of enhancements is crucial, not only to promote interaction and increase learning gains but also to support the learner working autonomously in the environment. In what follows, we focus on the potential of a parallel corpus for the development of enhanced reading tasks.

The obvious starting point for any reading comprehension assignment is to find an appropriate reading text. The task presented in this paper suits (high) intermediate learners of French. We selected a parallel text from the DPC by defining the text type (journalistic texts), the domain (communication) and the keyword (technology). The difficulty level of the text is B1, according to the Common European Framework of Reference. As described by those guidelines, learners at the B1-level are required to understand the main ideas of a journal article (Council of Europe 2001 ). The article selected for our case study focuses on technological developments and presents the  X  X  X ouse of the future X  X  (see Fig. 1 ). The text consists of short sentences and the content is assumed to be motivating for intermediate-level language learners.

Figure 1 presents a part of the text in its parallel version, with its general metadata (see Table 1 ) listed in Fig. 2 . In the reading comprehension exercise itself, only the target language text (= French version) is accessible to the learner (see Fig. 3 ). The reading text also contains a number of electronic enhancements.

One of the characteristics of using electronic enhancements is that they may come in many different forms: glosses, annotations containing multimedia material (picture, video, audio), native language translations, target language definitions, etc. However, when using corpus-based text materials, it seems hard to follow the path of existing on-line reading applications, which include multimedia annotations, isolated word translations, or definitions.

The enhancements generated by the DPC corpus can take at least three different forms: sentence translations, monolingual, and bilingual concordances. As shown in Fig. 3 , the corpus-generated enhancements are integrated in the environment through hypertexts that can be activated by clicking on the underlined bold words. The appropriate enhancement is subsequently shown on the screen. Figure 3 (examples 1 X 3) shows the three different types generated by the DPC. Although the three types of enhancements aim at making the message more comprehensible, each enhancement has its own particularities. (1) the corresponding Dutch translation of the sentence containing the target word
It is very likely that the French word la perc X e (the breakthrough) is unknown to the target audience (see Fig. 3 ). It may therefore be appropriate to link that word to the corpus and enhance it with additional information. Figure 3 shows that the word was enhanced by adding the native language (L1) translation. This enhancement subsequently allows the learner to find the translation of the unknown French word la perc X e . 15 Thanks to the enhancement, an initial form-meaning mapping can be installed, i.e. when  X  X  X  learner cognitively registers a form, a meaning, and the fact that the form encodes that meaning in some way X  X  (Van Patten, Williams and Rott 2004 : 5). Because learners X  L1 language is used in the enhancement, they do not need to rely on inferring strategies in order to derive the meaning of the unknown word from context (Liu and Nation 1985 ). We could therefore state that this type of enhancement is the easiest to interpret yet not the best to promote reading comprehension because learners may not only use the L1 enhancement to find the translation of the difficult word but also to understand the entire sentence. (2) a monolingual concordance containing the target word X  X timulating guessing
The second example concerns the collocation se brosser les dents (to brush your teeth). This type of enhancement proposes a L2 monolingual concordance that provides occurrences of the same target word (or combination of words) in another context, as available in the DPC. The monolingual concordance Toilette quotidienne ( se laver le visage, le torse et les mains, se brosser les dent, ... ) 16 is thus another occurrence of the same word combination se brosser les dents . When using monolingual L2 concordances, learners cannot rely on the availability of the L1 and are prompted to infer or guess the meaning from the corpus-generated context. By clicking on the (c) in the concordance, the learner activates the surrounding context of the sentence, which may provide further clarifications. One could raise some doubts towards the rather time-consuming activity of interpreting monolingual concordances in a reading task, when the purpose is primarily to get the meaning. However, as stated by Nation ( 2001 : 232), inferring word meaning through context can be seen as one of the most important sources of vocabulary acquisition in native language and claims that  X  X  X t should also be true for second language learners, but many do not experience the conditions that are needed for this kind of learning to occur X  X . Successful guessing or inferring correct word meaning relies on a number of factors. One of those factors is that learners tend to use clues for guessing. In our example, we can say that the additional concordance contains a  X  X  X ontextual clue X  X  (Nation 2001 : 242) i.e. toilette quotidienne (daily cleansing). In addition, providing the learner with monolingual concordances seems to fit particularly well with the idea of  X  X  X v]ariability of contexts. The more different the contexts in which a word recurs the greater the range of clues available X  X  and the  X  X  X p]resence of relevant clues X  X  (Nation 2001 : 243 X 244). (3) a parallel concordance containing the target word and the corresponding L1
The third type consists of a set of parallel concordances that contain  X  X  X exts in one language aligned with their translation into one or more languages X  X  (Frankenberg-Garc X   X  a 2005 : 190). The French word exc X dentaire is hyperlinked to parallel concordances (see Fig. 3 ), which show that the target word should be translated as overtollig or overmatig (superfluous). Although parallel corpora are mostly associated with translation studies and contrastive linguistics (see Sect. 1 ), their use may also be particularly valuable as a reading enhancement. The way they are used here is X  X lthough purely receptive X  X imilar to a contextualized dictionary which helps the user to get the meaning:  X  X  X w]hat a parallel text provides is, effectively, an on-line contextualized dictionary which language learners can exploit X  X  (Barlow 2000 : 114). We could also say that parallel concordances not only present the advantages of L1 translations but also those of target language concordances. Parallel concordances might therefore contribute to successful form-meaning mappings during enhanced reading tasks. (4) Focus on Form in a meaning-focused task
As shown in Fig. 3 , we also added a fourth type of enhancement (4). This enhancement illustrates the possibility to provide not only vocabulary information (as is usually the case in meaning-focused tasks) but also grammatical enrichments. The fourth example can be considered an illustration of what is called a planned Focus on Form (FonF), which consists in drawing learners X  attention to predefined linguistic items in a meaning-focused task (Leowen 2011 ). The corpus-generated enhancements may thus not only support deficient vocabulary knowledge but may also prompt learners to notice particular structural or grammatical elements that tend to cause problems. It can, for instance, be particularly interesting to highlight contrastive problems. Example (4) (see Fig. 3 ) refers to a lexico-grammatical problem and concerns the construction of the verb to wait : French: attendre  X  Dutch: wachten . When analyzing the sentence and the additional parallel concordances we notice that the verb attendre does not need a preposition to introduce the complement (see Table 2 ). In both English and Dutch, the valency pattern of the verb does contain a preposition, which may therefore lead to erroneous literal translations in learner speech and texts.

To sum up, in this first case study, the reading text as well as the additional enhancements were generated by the corpus. Together, they represent a corpus-based online reading task. In order to obtain the appropriate information, the learner clicks on the hypertext and performs an interactional modification. He does not need to browse through the corpus himself as would be the case when using a web interface or a traditional or electronic dictionary. Although the corpus could also be used as a search tool (i.e. reference resource) during reading, the integrated approach seems particularly beneficial as it can help learners to engage more with the reading process. However, although no tool switching or additional tool activation is necessary, it is still the learner who decides whether or not he  X  X  X ctivates X  X  enhancements. 4.2 Case study 2: comprehensible output and output enhancement in a writing The second case study describes the potential of a parallel corpus for assisting learners X  production of meaningful output. As outlined in the theoretical section of this paper, learners may notice gaps in their L2 knowledge which might prevent them from producing a particular structure or lexical item correctly. The idea of providing assistance to learners while writing texts seems thus crucial and has been at the basis of the development of a number of CALL writing aids. Hegelheimer ( 2006 : 5) advocated that  X  X  X c]urrent approaches to language pedagogy recognize the fact that ESL learners need explicit help to improve the grammatical accuracy of their writing X  X . Both lexical and grammatical help have been researched in order to stimulate L2 learners X  production of meaningful output. Online dictionaries were studied by, for instance, Kaur and Hegelheimer ( 2005 ) and Bland et al. ( 1990 ). Corpus-based grammar resources were studied by Hegelheimer ( 2006 ). Other studies using corpora for writing tasks have focused on its use as a reference resource during the revision process. These studies (e.g. Kennedy and Miceli 2010 ; O X  X ullivan and Chambers 2006 ) focused on how learners looked up particular aspects in the corpus and subsequently used that information to correct their texts. Because the abovementioned studies were based on monolingual corpora, an important limitation was related to the fact that learners based their search often on the incorrect word or structure. Because this search did not produce useful results and because learners were unaware of similar L2 words or structures, they were unable to use the corpus effectively for error correction (O X  X ullivan and Chambers 2006 ). One way to deal with this limitation is to look at the possibilities of a parallel corpus, which allows the learner to rely on his native language whenever necessary. In what follows, we study the use of a parallel corpus as a grammatical and lexical resource, which serves as an aid to produce meaningful output. In order to be able to use a corpus as a reference resource, two requirements should be fulfilled (Peters et al. 2000 : 74):  X  X (1) a high quality corpus, sufficiently representative of the object it aims at modeling (whether the entire lexicon or particular sub-sets of it), and large enough to provide a sufficient number of valid data samples, must be available; (2) easy to use, flexible access, query and analysis procedures must be implemented X  X . Considering those requirements, we believe the DPC is particularly appropriate as it does not only consist of high-quality translations but is also easily accessible through a user-friendly web interface (see Sect. 2.3 ).

In this case study, we will illustrate how the corpus may answer learners X  (a) lexical and (b) grammatical questions and assist them at points where traditional resources such as bilingual dictionaries and learner grammars present shortcomings. Yet, we should also point out that learners need to be provided with exploratory tasks dealing with the concrete use of the web interface, before using the corpus during output production. In what follows, we present two examples, which focus on Dutch-speaking learners of French. (a) Parallel corpus versus bilingual dictionary
Finding an adequate translation of a word or a multiword unit is one of the major difficulties that language learners face while producing target language text. This problem is especially annoying when the bilingual dictionary does not provide a clear context. In case of polysemous words, for example, students may produce a semantically incorrect sentence because the information provided by the reference resource lacks additional context. For instance, when a learner looks up the Dutch word bedrijf (a company), the bilingual dictionary (e.g. Van Dale Lexicografie 2002 ) proposes three translations : enterprise, acte, and fonctionnement. If we are referring to a company, only the first translation entreprise is correct. In other contexts, the bilingual dictionary only proposes one possible translation, although multiple words or structures could be used. Whereas bilingual dictionaries present shortcomings, the validity of using parallel corpora for word sense disambiguation (i.e. the selection of the correct translation of a polysemous word in a given context) is widely accepted in the NLP (Natural Language Processing) community (Ide et al. 2002 ; Lefever et al. 2011 ). In addition, parallel corpora have also been defined as a  X  X  X ontextualized bilingual dictionary X  X  (Barlow 2000 ), Dickens and Salkie ( 1996 : 553) proposed the notion of  X  X  X ich translation equivalence X  X , which refers to  X  X  X t]he wider range of strategies that the corpus shows up X  X .

In order to illustrate the idea of rich translation equivalence by means of a concrete example taken from the DPC, we use the Dutch structure beter gezegd ( or rather ). A literal translation into French is excluded, the bilingual dictionary (Van Dale Lexicografie 2002 ) offers one possibility plus pr X cis X ment . We enter a search query in the web interface by selecting a bilingual search (Dutch X  X rench) as shown in Fig. 4 . To search the corpus (see Fig. 4 ), we enter two search words: beter in box A and gezegd in box B, we also indicate that there cannot be another word between the two search words (box C).

A quick search in the DPC corpus shows that there are at least two other possibilities: mieux and plus exactement (see Fig. 5 ) and confirms the potential of a parallel corpus as a rich translation resource. (b) Parallel corpus as grammar resource
When analyzing learner texts, a number of grammatical specificities seem to cause recurring errors. In her error tagging system of learner texts, Granger ( 2003 : 468) distinguished different grammatical error categories: class, auxiliary, gender, mode, number, person, tense, voice and euphony. A lot of these errors can be corrected by looking up information in a dictionary, learner grammars or via monolingual searches in a corpus. However, one of the fundamental difficulties in writing assignments concerns the fact that learners often tend to rely too much on their mother tongue. This mostly leads to incorrect literal translations of the L1 sentence. Although problematic, these issues are very often ignored in typical learner grammars. This is the case for grammatical structures that occur in one language but not in another. One of the typical constrastive difficulties for Dutch speaking learners of French is the use of the nominalized infinitive (NI) (van Baardewijk-Resse  X  guier and van Willigen-Sinemus 1989 ). Both learner grammars and dictionaries do not provide support for dealing with the NI since that structure does not exist in French. In Dutch, however, every verb can be transformed into a NI by adding a definite article (see Table 3 ). The NI structure can act as subject or complement in the sentence (see examples in Fig. 6 ).

The purpose of our search is to identify as many structures as possible in order to find out which strategies are used to translate the typical Dutch structure into French. We perform a bilingual search on the entire corpus and enter the definite article  X  X  X et X  X  in the first search box and indicate that the word in the second box should be a verb, more precisely an infinitive (see Fig. 4 box A and B). There cannot be another word between the two search words as to minimize the amount of noise in the results (Fig. 4 box C). We perform the search on the entire corpus, which means that we also search in texts that are not necessarily pedagogically relevant, 17 but may contain interesting examples. We tick off the box random hits to retrieve different results each time we search the corpus (only 100 results are shown at once). The search returned 5489 results, which reveal not only different strategies to translate the NI into French but also illustrate the notion of  X  X  X ich translation equivalence X  X  from a grammatical point of view (Dickens and Salkie 1996 : 553). As shown in Fig. 6 (examples 2, 3, 5, and 6), one of the most frequent translation strategies is to use a deverbative noun. Other strategies are to translate the NI by means of an infinitive verb (1) or the structure le fait de/que (4) 18 (see Fig. 6 ).
Although the use of a corpus may prevent learners from making errors during production, appropriate error correction or feedback remains crucial. The use of output enhancement (Takashima and Ellis 1999 ), which may  X  X  X ush X  X  the learner to modify the original sentence in order to write a more correct utterance, seems therefore important. Output enhancement may also be corpus-based and include of an annotated version of the learner text, containing corpus-based hints to revise and modify the original output. An interesting scenario could be to identify problematic structures or words, based on a series of NLP techniques and provide the learners with the corresponding corpus-based enhancements, leading to noticing and correction of the erroneous utterance. 5 Conclusions and future research The main objective of this paper was to show the value of a parallel corpus for the development of enriched CALL activities that stimulate interactions and foster autonomy.
 We first enumerated the basic prerequisites of a pedagogically relevant corpus. Based on findings in literature on corpus compilation and processing, we proposed a series of compilation requirements and explained the (pedagogical) usefulness of different processing layers. We then showed how the interactionist approach can substantiate the design of corpus-based CALL activities and presented two case studies: a receptive reading comprehension task and a productive writing assignment. The reference corpus for the concrete development of our case studies was the DPC.

Schematically, we could represent the theoretical underpinnings of our case studies as follows:
The framework in Fig. 7 shows that the corpus is at the basis of the two language tasks: it provides the enhancements and serves as a reference resource for linguistic production. The corpus is represented by the ellipse form and includes the input and the enhancements. The corpus can also be seen as a reference resource. The learner occupies a central position, located outside the corpus, and is in control of possible interactions with the input (for obtaining comprehensible input) or with the corpus for producing comprehensible output. The eventual output (be it written or spoken) is located outside the corpus as this is the learners X  outcome, based on inside interactions between corpus data, the task, and the learner.

The main limitation of this study concerns the absence of experimental evaluation of the two case studies presented. The case studies do, however, present a number of interesting future research tracks for validating the potential of parallel corpora in CALL and the use of an interactionist framework for sustaining the development of corpus-based CALL activities. The first case study could be at the basis of an experiment focusing on L2 reading comprehension. Research questions may be asked with respect to the effectiveness of the different enhancements presented in the first case study for enhancing L2 learners X  comprehension. Research could also focus on the use of grammar prompts and their effects on learners X  retention of the enhanced structures. The second experimental study could focus on how learners actually use the parallel corpus during a productive task. Research questions may be asked with respect to the type of information looked up by the learners (e.g. grammatical structures, lexical items, translation, etc.) and study the effect of look-ups on output production and correction. The study could involve learners from different proficiency levels in order to gain more insight into the benefits of a parallel corpus for learners of different proficiencies.

In general, we hope to have illustrated that a parallel corpus can be much more than a translation resource, it may be an engaging reference resource for a variety of language tasks aiming at stimulating different learning goals and outcomes.
