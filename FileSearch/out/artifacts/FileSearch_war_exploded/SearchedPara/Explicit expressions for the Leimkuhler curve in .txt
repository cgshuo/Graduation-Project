Previous results L with cumulative distribution function F X we define its inverse distribution function by verse of the cdf, as in the Gastwirth X  X  (1971) definition of the Lorenz curve. curve K X corresponding to X is defined by continuous distributions (two-parameter exponential distribution, etc.) in a unifying way. differentiable almost everywhere in [0,1] with K X  X  0  X  X  0 and K X  X  1  X  X  1.

 From a geometric viewpoint it is natural to enquire whether an LC exhibits symmetry. Definition 3. A Leimkuhler curve K X  X  X  is symmetric if, 3. Alternative expression for the Leimkuhler curve F X by, F defined on the positive real line.
 If we set r  X  1in (4) we obtain the first-moment distribution of the population, ductivity less than or equal to x .
 A random variable with r -moment distribution F  X  r  X  X will be represented by X  X  r  X  , r  X  1 ; 2 ; ... We have next result.

If we made the change of variable F X  X  y  X  X  t in definition (1) we obtain, which is formula (5) . h 4. Models mation science and econometrics. 4.1. Classical and exponentiated Pareto distributions Let X be a classical Pareto distribution (see Arnold, 1983 ) with cumulative distribution function tion is, and the mathematical expectation l X  X  ar =  X  a 1  X  if a &gt; 1. Using (1) the Leimkuhler curve is, part (iii) in Egghe (2005a) .

Three-parameter lognormal distribution form, used in citation age studies (see for example Egghe &amp; Ravichandra Rao, 1992; Gupta, 1998 ). The cdf of (12) is, tributions is lognormal again and is given by Aitchison and Brown (1957) , In particular X  X  1  X  LN  X  l  X  r 2 ; r 2  X  . We obtain next result. Leimkuhler curve is given by , Proof. Using (5) and (14) with r  X  1 we have, and taking in consideration that U  X  x  X  X  1 U  X  1 x  X  , formula (15) is obtained. h found in Arnold (1987) or Sarabia (2008b) .
 If we use (2) and (15) we have: which is the Leimkuhler curve of the three-parameter Lognormal distribution defined in (12) . Two important properties of (15) deserve our attention and are given in next Proposition. Proposition 3. With respect to lognormal populations: (a) Let X LN ( l , r ) be a two-parameter lognormal distribution. Then, the Leimkuhler curve is symmetric. Proof. For showing (a) we use definition (3) and formula (15) : Result (b) is direct because K X  X  u  X  is a monotonic increasing function in r . h Result (a) was proved by Burrell (2005) using the pdf, by means of a result of Kendall (1956) .

 The half normal distribution: a  X  2 and p  X  1 = 2.
 The two-parameter lognormal distribution: as a ! 0, p ; r !1 , a 2 ! r 2 and r p 1 = a ! l . We consider the incomplete gamma function ratio defined by, with m &gt; 0, and its inverse function defined as, bution and, We have next result.
 Proof. Without loss of generality we can assume r  X  1. Then, using (19) the inverse of the cdf is, We consider some relevant particular cases. Let X G  X  p ; r  X  be a classical gamma distribution with pdf, where r ; p &gt; 0. The Leimkuhler curve is, checking the Leimkuhler curves.
 For the one-parameter exponential distribution with cdf, and F X  X  x  X  X  0if x &lt; 0, where r &gt; 0, formula (21) becomes in: cdf, satisfies that Y  X  X  X  k and using (2) and (23) we have, which is the Leimkuhler curve corresponding to (24) (see Sarabia, 2008a ). the generalized gamma distribution. 4.4.

 Proposition 5. Let X GB1  X  a ; p ; q ; r  X  be a GB1 distribution. Then, the Leimkuhler curve is given by , Proof. The proof is direct using (5) together with expressions (26) and (27) with r  X  1. h Fig. 4 shows the Leimkuhler curve of some generalized beta distribution of the first kind distributions. In some particular cases formula (28) can be simplified: Power distribution ( q  X  1): where a  X  ap .

Let X be a random variable with Singh X  X addala distribution with cdf, information sources (see Burrell, 2002; Basulto &amp; Ortega, 2005 ). Sarabia (2008a) has obtained this LC using definition (1) directly. We have two particular cases: If r  X  1 = a  X  1 and s  X  q 1 = a is a positive integer (37) becomes in, If both r and s are positive integers we have, A simpler formula can be obtained when q  X  1  X  1 = a .If a &gt; 0, r  X  1 and 0 6 x 6 1, Using now formula (38) , general expression (37) becomes in: Sarabia, Castillo, and Slottje (1999) .
 The Dagum distribution is defined in terms of the cdf as, (2005) has suggested this distribution in modelling citation age data. If we set q  X  1in (35) we obtain the LC of the Dagum distribution ( a &gt; 1): Fig. 6 shows some Leimkuhler curves for the Dagum distribution.
