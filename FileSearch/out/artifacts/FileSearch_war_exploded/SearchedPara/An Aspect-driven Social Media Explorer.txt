 We demonstrate an exploration tool that organizes social media content under diverse aspects enabling comprehensive explorations. Unlike existing approaches that group content by trending topics, we present a holistic view of diverse and relevant content with respect to a given query.

Communities within social networks that intersect with a company X  X  targeted audience enable the assessment of brand perception, customer satisfaction, and consumer needs and therefore go beyond marketers X  standard key performance indicators. The amount and diversity of information in so-cial networks is challenging and relevance-based exploration tools are needed.

We introduce a tool for marketers that organizes social media content by employing methods for term level search result diversification enabling the comprehensive exploration of diverse and relevant content. Existing listening and mon-itoring tools suggest a content categorization into trending topics based on the volume, the recency or the burstiness of keywords, which lacks of the capability to identify aspects with low popularity, ongoing and non-volatile aspects, and a notion of relevance for better exploration.

Retrieval Method. Our approach is based on concepts used for term level search result diversification by Dang and Croft [8]. A ranking becomes more diverse the more nov-elty each document introduces to the higher ranked content. Common diversification frameworks, such as xQuAD [13] or PM-2 [7] which are either considering redundancy or propor-tionality for computing a diverse ranking, are given a set of Figure 2: Time series of the volume of selected as-pects. t  X  X  power to discriminate between relevant and non-relevant documents, weighted by the relevance of each document to the initial query q . The predictiveness of t aggregates the probabilities that t  X  X  co-occurring terms always co-occur with t in a given proximity window.

For our exploration tool, the DSPApprox variant identi-fies and ranks aspects associated with a given query q . Each aspect is used to categorize and re-rank social media content by using it as a sub-query. The algorithm outputs aspects that are diverse, represent superior sub-queries, and are rel-evant to q in order to surface documents that are represen-tative for the particular aspects. Here, aspects are either words, phrases, or hashtags that also function as readable and meaningful category descriptors.

Related Work. TweetMotif by Krieger and Ahn [9] iden-tifies topic phrases (aspects) by computing a likelihood ra-tio similar to our topicality score and merges redundant as-pects as diversification approach. Our method differs as it additionally considers a relevance model. Furthermore, we achieve diversity by the scoring the predictiveness of terms after each iteration of selecting and removing a term from a candidate set.

Other related approaches such as trend detection based on the burstiness of keywords [11] or event summarization [12] are likely to ignore aspects with low popularity or volatil-ity. Additionally, general multi-document summarization algorithms have the disadvantage that they require a post-processing step to consider diversification.

Aspects can also be understood as a non-exclusive docu-ment partitioning computed by a clustering or topic model-ing algorithm. These approaches require the number of top-ics as a parameter and their output is not providing readable descriptors.
A three-tier architecture balances the amount of data and the provided functionalities. At the first level, a Cassan-dra database stores the content from a variety of social net-works. The data stems from owned social accounts as well as GNIP [1], a third-party social data provider, and is en-hanced with extracted meta data, such as spam, sentiment, or emotion scores.

At the second level, an Apache Tomcat container uses the open source search engine Galago [6], which implements the ranking functionality including a language model and a relevance model. Galago operates on an global index for reference statistics and on an ad-hoc index of the social data retrieved from the first tier. The DSPApprox algo-rithm and also the computation of word co-occurrences are implemented here. The results are materialized and stored in the requested HTML document.

The third level is the user X  X  Web-browser. It enables the rendering of content according to the style of particular so-
