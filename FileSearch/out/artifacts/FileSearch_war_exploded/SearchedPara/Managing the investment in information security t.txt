 1. Introduction
For today X  X  organizations, connecting to a complex environment such as the internet is not a choice, but a necessity in order to survive in the market. By doing this they expose a significant portion of their intangible assets (databases, comput-ing programs, manufacturing processes, logistic process design, customer data, other business secrets, and IPR assets), which are often more important than the real estate and other tangible assets. The security objectives related to the protection of this digital-asset base are expressed in terms of confidentiality (non-disclosure to unauthorized persons), integrity (non-by unintentional or malicious acts). According to the 2009 Computer Security Institute/Federal Bureau of Investigation Com-puter Crime and Security Survey, 475 of the 522 respondent organizations experienced computer-security incidents, such as viruses, insider attacks, laptop thefts, denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to data or networks, and bots. Despite tems regularly fail or are subject to malicious attacks. Economic incentives are increasingly recognized as the main factor contributing to today X  X  massive exposure to insecure software. A study recently carried out by ETH (Frei, 2009) has shown that vendors do not react as expected after the vulnerability of their software was discovered. The study also showed that the security econometrics and the related dynamics need to be carefully considered by the organizations themselves and that this is a much better approach to preventing incidents then responding to them when they occur.  X 
However, the technology alone, as indicated by many researchers recently, cannot resolve the information-security prob-lems; thus, they tried to include the economic point of view in the equation. This approach enables business managers to develop a better understanding of the security investments, because a technical analysis of the implications of security fail-ures and the damage caused by cyber incidents were replaced by an analysis of the economic losses ( Acquisti, Friedman, &amp;
Telang, 2006 ). This is the reason why security-aware organizations are shifting their focus from what is technically feasible Schneier, 2004 ).

When looking at an information-security system from the economic point of view, many answers can be found to the tions are: How to provide security for IT-based operations? Which security level is adequate? How much money should be invested in security? Organizations normally seek answers to these questions in the framework of risk management.
Information-security risk management is the overall process that integrates the identification and analysis of risks to which an organization is exposed, the assessment of the potential impact on the business, and the decision regarding the cessful attacks on the systems exposed to the digital world, as well a cost-and-benefit analysis of the security investments ( Hoo, 2000 ). In that context the past decade has introduced a more complex view of information-security management and risk assessment. Among the new approaches introduced in this field is compliance with the regulations and standards such rity budgets and for the support of organizational goals, while maintaining an appropriate level of security in a particular organization ( Shirtz &amp; Elovici, 2011 ). Meeting these requirements entails a complicated process of decision making and the selection of the best security measures and its implementation. In selecting a measure for information-security provi-sion, different perspectives may be taken, such as the response to vulnerabilities, software application development for the prevention of attacks, the transfer of risk to an insurance organization, or the introduction of managerial and economic or status of a higher indenture level should include equipment availability from the perspective of the management in a request for a security response and a related decision regarding the organizational needs for the minimization of any poten-tial damage. The starting point regarding the decision to be taken has to be derived from expert opinions and the needs of management within an agreed security policy and the available budget.

The risk-management process typically consists of two main stages, known as risk assessment and risk treatment. Risk assessment is the process of deciding whether the existing protection is sufficient to protect the information assets against possible threats. The assessment provides information about the threats to which an organization X  X  assets are exposed and information-system vulnerabilities that could be abused by the threats. The treatment is a process of selection and the implementation of security measures to the reduce risk. The treatment usually consists of risk avoidance, risk mitigation, risk transfer and risk acceptance. Standards and guidelines are available for setting up information-security management in an organization; however, advancements in the field of technology increase the demands for more sophisticated deci-sion-making approaches when it comes to the security for technology investments, and data and digital asset protection ( Gordon &amp; Richardson, 2004 ).

This paper presents a mathematical model for support in the decision making for the selection of the security technology ments. The model makes use of a quantitative analysis of different security measures that counteract individual risks by identifying information processes within an organization and the potential threats. The model comprises the target security that may be suffered by the organization. The selection of the security technology is based on the efficiency of the security measures selected. Economic matrices are applied for the efficiency assessment and a comparative analysis of the different of the model in Section 3 , the possible interactions between different security measures and their hierarchy are presented in
Section 4 . The risk management and the selection of the optimal measure using the quantitative model are presented in Sec-tion 5 ; the model X  X  application and possible scenarios of use are provided in Section 6 ; examples from real life and a com-parison of the model X  X  results with the incident occurrence simulation and the associated losses are described in Section 7 .
The paper ends with a discussion and suggestions for further work. 2. Related research
Information security was traditionally considered as a technical discipline, whose purpose was to provide the maximum level of security ( McGraw, 2006 ). In the past decade, a major economic component was considered in the related research as the investments in information security are rapidly increasing ( Anderson, 2001 , 2005). Information-security economics, a the incentives between the involved stakeholders. Cavusoglu (2004, chap. 6) argues that information security should be viewed not just as a cost, but as a value creator that supports and enables e-business operations. Cavusoglu (2004, chap. 6) claims that a secure environment for information and transaction flows can create value for organizations and their part-ments in a comparable way. The cost of an investment includes the price of the required hardware, software and labor (among others); however, it is more difficult to quantify the benefits. At the same time, it is important that the investment value is not higher than the value of the protected asset. An estimation of the total cost of security breaches can be made in several ways. Some approaches try to quantify short-term and long-term costs, or tangible and intangible costs, while other approximate value of the true cost of the security breach ( Farahmand, Navathe, Enslow, &amp; Sharp, 2003 ). Farahmand suggest a simple probability-based model for the valuation of possible attacks. The probability assessment for each incident is sub-the quantitative probability estimates.

The calculation of the optimal investment in information security is a relatively new approach in the area of enterprise information technology. The focus regarding IT security solutions was previously oriented exclusively to a search of technical problem were proposed. The proposed analytical models are based on a cost X  X enefit analysis. The potential risk of security lytical decision-making frameworks for evaluating different IT security policies was proposed by Hoo (2000) . In his work he replicated a group of protective measures or policies, and for each policy he tries to find the best compromise between the costs and the benefits. Gordon and Loeb (2001, 2002a) propose an economic model that determines the optimal amount to invest in information security by calculating the marginal benefits of information-security investments. An organization should only invest up to the point where the marginal benefits of the investment equal the marginal costs. Whenever the marginal benefit is larger than the marginal cost, the investment should be increased. Willemson (2006) emphasizes that the suggested upper limit of the model may not be correct when the model is applied to the general case and to all possible vulnerability functions. Ryan and Ryan (2006) view security as an inversion of the risk and establish a quantitative approach to measure the gains in security through the expected-loss risk measurements. An approach to base the investment decision an attractive investment. The approach is based on the ability to obtain probability distributions for information-security failures. It uses survivor and failure functions, but since the available data are censored and therefore biased, the quality of the results is questionable. For this reason, Ryan and Ryan (2006) introduced the Kaplan X  X eier and Nelson X  X alen estima-tors that can be used instead. The basic assumption is that an investment in security reduces the risk of successful attacks.
The advantage of an investment is measured as the difference between the expected losses in the investment or no-invest-ment scenario. An alternative method uses so-called game theory ( Cavusoglu, 2004, chap. 6 ). Cavusoglu argues that the tra-ditional decision-analytic approaches to evaluating IT security investments treat the security technology as a black box and do not consider the difference between the investments in information-security solutions from the general IT investments.
He treats information security as a game between the organization and the potential attackers with a motive to cause dam-age for personal profit or satisfaction. McGraw X  X  (2006) view on software security is based on  X  X he idea of engineering soft-ware that continues to function correctly under malicious attacks. X  In order to solve the problem of software security,
McGraw (2006) proposes three pillars: (1) applied risk management, (2) software security touch-points (best practices into the software development life-cycle) and (3) knowledge. He also argues that an ICT system is usually built on the assumption that the system would not be intentionally abused, resulting in cases of use that describe the system X  X  normative behavior, predicated on the assumption of correct usage. Past breaches of information security have resulted in both immediate and indirect losses. However, indirect losses have often been more serious than the direct losses. The optimal level of informa-tion-security investments is treated on the basis of the expected cost/benefit investment trade-offs. This and our previous (ROSI)  X  net benefits from security investment divided by costs.

In this investigation we focus on a more exact quantification of the security risks and on the digital-asset assessments required for an optimal selection of the security technology investment. The security measures that counteract individual risks are quantified in the context of their application within the information processes that take place within an organiza-security accident together with the expected loss. The model is applied in several examples of possible security incidents and illustrated with results based on the simulations. 3. Short overview of the model
The Table 10 that introduces the elements used in the model and the list of the associated input and output data is an-nexed to this paper.

The model is based on business processes that have certain security requirements for the protection of data and other information relevant for a particular organization. The business process P of an organization and the associated set of of these variables represents the desired levels of security for individual business processes. Since there is usually a large number of business processes within an organization, this model focuses only on the core business processes.
The information assets a are involved in all the business processes. The security parameters of the information assets engaged in the business process P are based on the business-process security requirements defined in the organization X  X  security policy and strategy.

If there are n business processes, then each individual process is defined as a P process to the next, the information assets engaged in more than one business process can appear with different target val-ues. In this case, the highest security target value is selected.
 The aim of this procedure is to set the desired values of the security requirements for every information asset.
The risk-assessment procedure determines and evaluates the vulnerabilities and the threats for every information asset that is part of a business process. The output risk-assessment data is the risk parameter defined by the probability of the occurrence of a security incident and the consequences of that incident.

System vulnerability v ( t ) is defined as the probability (0 &lt; form of an incident on an information asset in time t. The limit value v = 0 indicates that the information assets are com-pletely protected and secured, while v = 1 means the information assets are vulnerable, irrespective of the implementation of countermeasures. The two limit values are not reasonable in practice, and as a consequence they are left out of the scope.
Threat probability T ( t ) is defined as the probability of an attack on information assets. The threat probability (0 t) 6 1) is equal to the number of attacks per unit time in a given period of time t . The basic assumption of the model is that the risk assessment should consider multiple vulnerability-threat relation scenarios, i.e.,
Some of the attacks can be successful, resulting in a security incident, while others are not successful. The probability that a threat is successful in time t is determined by the vulnerability of an information asset v(t).

Therefore, q ( t ) is the probability of a security incident occurrence (0 uct of the threat probability T(t ) and the asset vulnerability ( t ).
The function q also fulfills two boundary conditions. The incident probability has a zero value when there are no attacks nerability is zero).
 human beings, the exact value of the likelihood that an incident will happen is significantly more difficult than an assess-ment of the probability of a natural disaster in some period of time ( Anderson, 2001; Hoo, 2000 ). In calculating the proba-bility of an incident involving a natural disaster (e.g., earthquake and flood) the expected recurrence of an incident can be estimated based on historical data. Models that have been applied so far can predict some future events only in cases when the statistical relationships are stationary over time. When the influence of independent variables on the dependent variable changes, then the prediction of the model became unreliable. This stationary requirement is even more difficult to achieve when it comes to modeling events caused by the human factor (e.g., malicious individuals) in the cyber security ecosystem.
Attackers usually have the advantage over defenders. Unlike nature, attackers seek out the weakest point of the system, choose the most appropriate time for them, constantly improve their knowledge and hinder attempts that monitor their regarding the threats. One of the reasons for this is that in addition to outside attackers the treatment of insider attackers requires other specific measures. Most of them are incorporated into the organizational part of the adopted security policy.
However, it has been proved through studies that if the organization has achieved a high level of security and has imple-tini, 2005 ). Some theories, like game theory, could help to refine this as well as the information about existing Honeypot/ Honeynet on the Internet.
 etary units (e.g., in EURO). The quantitative evaluation of the loss is composed as follows: Here
Cost of equipment replacement L s is the price of new equipment. These types of losses are the easiest ones to evaluate, significantly reduced by investments into guarantees issued by producers or maintenance service providers. Cost of repair works L r ( t ) is evaluated as:
Here Corporate income loss L i ( t ) is evaluated as: Here Organization productivity loss L p ( t ) I is evaluated as:
Here Loss due to failure that complies with legal or contractual provisions is denoted as L tract and/or legislation; for example, a service provider might be obliged to reimburse a part of the clients X  expenses in the case that the availability of their service is below the SLA level.

Eqs. (5) X (7) include two parameters of time  X  time to repair t available t NA . t NA is composed of the time to detect t restore the functionalities of a system t r . The time t d the incident is detected.

To avoid any exaggerated complexity of the model, several simplifications were introduced, e.g., the assumption that the efforts to resolve the problem are initiated as soon as the incident is detected, the assumption that there are incidents in which t r &gt; 0 and t d &gt; 0 (although they do not result in service dysfunction) and t result in repair costs, but they do not completely impair the functioning of a system. The model makes a distinction between as t
NA 6 t is unusual these two parameters are merged into one, so the sign is changed to an equals sign. In order to avoid an additional variable of time, the variable EF i is set to zero, thus EF By taking this into account, Eq. (4) can be simplified as: In which case: The estimated probability of occurrence of a security incident and a loss enable a calculation of the security risk R :
The security risk R represents the expected financial loss caused by the security incident measured in the same monetary unit as L (e.g., in euros). 4. Hierarchy of the security measures to be selected and the possible interactions
Eachorganization,whendecidingtoinvestinsecuritytechnology,needstoconsiderthehierarchyofdifferentsecuritymea-sures and the possible interactions among them. Some of the proposed investment models that consider this problem ( Rich-ardson, 2009 ) build the decision about the necessary investment in a proactive way with an improvement of the capability to develop an integrated hierarchy of security measures based on the control and management of information security using the holistic approach of security metrics as applied in many Swedish organizations. The result was a 14-layered hierarchical model derived by analogy with the 7-layerd ISO/OSI model. The first seven layers are taken from the ISO/OSI model, upgraded fect of prevention and risk management in a particular organization. In organizations with developed authorization and managerial roles, the decision-makers appear on the strategic, tactical and operational levels. The optimal quantitate model presented in this paper is a tool used at the managerial level, with the task being to implement the policy and the standards adopted at the strategic and tactical levels of the organizational decision making. The communication between the operational and the technical levels is carried out as the communication process envisaged by the 14-layered model. The order of installa-tion or the introduction of each security measure is a decision taken by these two responsible layers.

As the operational level is deeply involved in the communication process between the layers involved in the decision-mak-nosticworkis of key importance inthe decision-makingprocess.The diagnostic workthat provides informationaboutpossible

All of these tools are usually embedded into an actual organization X  X  pro-duction-information infrastructure. However, it was noticed that the appearance of many false-positive alarms generated by ally combine these tools in a unique way in order to maximize their effectiveness and their utility. This practice is known as bricolage. To set up and use this bricolage the operational workers must have an in-depth knowledge about the organization X  X  infrastructureandaboutthesecurityecosystem.Astheycommunicatewiththemanageriallevel,whichtakesthefinaldecision aboutpossibleinvestmentsinasecuritymeasure,theyprovidethenecessaryinformationregardingthequalityandthepriceof the technology selected as well as the expected effectiveness in preventing security incidents when using it.
In business terms, managerial success is usually measured by effectiveness, such as whether the objectives are accom-plished or not. The interaction between security measures in that context can be measured as the effectiveness provided by their proper selection and implementation, meaning that the maximum effect in the protection of organizational infor-mation is achieved for the money invested. Currently, there are four interrelated perspectives on the effectiveness of infor-mation-security measures that interact and are part of the general organizational security policy ( Hagen, Albrechtsen, &amp;
Horden, 2008 ): 1. The risk-management perspective takes into account that failures of information security are clearly adverse, which 2. The economic perspective: an information-security measure gives a positive return on investment. An economic 3. The legal perspective: information-security measures avoid any violations of legal requirements. Efforts must be made 4. The cultural perspective: information security creates a good security culture. In this perspective, effectiveness is
The four perspectives are interrelated because different security measures interact within an organization during the pro-vision of the security X  X  policy implementation. How they interact is a problem that has not been elaborated in depth as only a few empirical studies exist that deal only with the effectiveness of the organizational information-security measures. Most of the terms focus on a single security measure. The legal and regulatory requirements depend more on the people and proce-dures in the organization than on the technical security measures. An empirical study (Hagen et al., 2008) has shown that the interaction between different implemented security measures evaluated as the assessed security performance of the orga-nization does not show significant correlations. In the Hagen study (Hagen et al., 2008) the interrelations of the following known implemented measures were presented: security policy, procedures and control, technical tools and methods (such as assets classification, incident handling, redundancy of critical systems, intruder-detection systems, anti-virus software and firewalls) and awareness measures. The correlation indexes between these measures were weak and less than 0.5. How-ever, other evidence shows that an organization putting more effort and investments in security has a better performance compared to those that put a much smaller investment in security. The major question that requires an answer is: how large should the investment be?
The model presented here focuses on the economic perspective of the security measure, i.e., maximizing the effectiveness of the security measure, which is understood as technical tool or technology that should be selected and implemented as a solution for a particular asset vulnerability by considering the amount of available money for investment. It is a well-known and widely accepted claim ( Hagen et al., 2008 ) that without technology-based security measures there would be no need to have administrative/organizational measures, since it is the technological solutions that prevent, detect and react to un-wanted incidents. All the upgraded layers of the 14-layred model ( Monfelt et al., 2011 ) are built on the understanding that (2008) showed that the effectiveness of the technology-based measures was assessed by the organization X  X  employees as being very effective. 5. Risk assessment and security-measure selection
The relationships between risks, vulnerabilities, threats and security measures are complex. For example, one threat can attack several different vulnerabilities, one measure can protect against multiple threats or one asset will need to be pro-tected by several security measures. The presented model in this paper supports all these complex relationships. However, we explain here the proposed procedure with a simple measure selection.

For a known risk assessment the organization can select one of the possible options for minimizing the risk, such as:
A combination of these measures is also an option, e.g., an organization first reduces the risks with an investment, and then either transfers the remaining risk to an insurance agency, or assesses the remaining risk to be acceptable, thus intro-ducing no additional measures.

The strategy of selection is performed by the use of the risk-parameter limit values; these values are specified as follows:
Individual risks are depicted on the diagram q = q (L ) presented in Fig. 1 . The curves on this diagram represent the points with the same risk value. The security measure s that reduce the risk R transpose the risk point to a lower risk curve R .Ifa countermeasure reduces the incident probability q the diagram moves horizontally to the left.

Every risk is calculated with R and L values and is compared to the limit values R could be: 1. R&gt;R max  X  in that case it is better to avoid risks due to high risk levels. R 2. R&lt;R min  X  here the risk is negligible, thus the introduction of a security measure is not financially justified. 4. L &lt;L max  X  here it is recommended to invest in a measure to reduce the risk.

The process of security-measure selection is presented in Fig. 2 . The selection is made by examining the parameters where in addition to the parameters R min , R max and L max by the organization S(a ) and corporate budget for information-security investments C
The cost of an individual measure C (or combination of several) must not exceed the budget. In the case that the risk-reduc-tion process does not provide any suitable measure or bunch of measures to counteract a specific risk, then the strategy should be re-estimated, either by allowing risk acceptance or by implementing the avoidance strategy.

An organization protects itself from potential security attacks by implementing security measures that can be classified into three categories according to their impact on the parameters R , q and L :
The corrective security measures are different from the preventative security measures when it comes to reducing the not detected by detective security controls, it can be identified through the consequences and from other footprints left be-hind by the malicious user or malicious code.

The use of detective protection enables loss reduction and a more realistic assessment of the attack probability T , and the incident probability q . When organizations are not using detective controls, the probability values are merely an estimate and they can differ a great deal from realistic values. Wrong assumptions can also lead to a non-optimal selection of security measures. Some examples of security measures include:
Security measure s ( a , C ) is defined by the parameter productivity of the security measure a and the cost of the security measure C .

Cost of security measure C is defined as a monetary investment to reduce the security risk R . C is measured in the same mentation of the selected security measure. When introducing the security measures it is always necessary to consider the corporate budget 2 for security investments C ITsec_budget (0 the security measure C refers to various expenses: Some of these are one-time expenses, while others are periodic expenses: C i and C m are time dependent and their values equal the number of working hours per hourly rate: where p is the average hourly wage of an employee working to introduce the measure, ment the measure.
 where p is the average hourly wage of an employee in charge of maintenance, t
A rough estimate of the security-measure investment costs can be calculated with the GLEIS model ( Gordon &amp; Loeb, 2002b , 2005). This model suggests that the investment in security measures should not exceed 37% of the potential loss L .
Productivity of a security measure a (t ) &gt; 0 presents the impact of a security measure on the risk reduction. Since new threats continuously emerge, the security-measure productivity a (t ) drops in a convex manner in the case that no secu-rity-measure investments are introduced to counteract it.
The security-incident probability q ( t ) can be reduced by introducing a preventive security measure s tion q is supplemented in such a way that it introduces dependency from the security-measure investment C very popular among the researchers in the field ( Liu, Tanaka, &amp; Matsuura, 2008 ):
This function fits the boundary condition such that  X  X n the case of an unlimited investment, the incident probability limits towards zero X :
The preventive security measure s p reduces the incident probability; this can be described as:
The loss resulting from security incidents can also be reduced with an investment C s ( a c ,C c ) and with an investment C d into a detective security measure s
Corrective security measures reduce the repair and non-availability time, consequently reducing the organization X  X  loss caused by the incident. This is expressed with the following equation: where t 0 r represents the time needed to repair without the implementation of a security measure. The function t and convex throughout the interval 0 6 C c &lt; C ITsec_budget
As for detective security measures, we can say that:
Function t d is declining and get convex form throughout the interval 0
One of the possible security measures is also the transfer of risk (e.g., to an insurance organization). In such a case, the investment C represents a monthly premium; in the case of an incident, the insurance agency pays a compensation I to cover the loss. Since the risk transfer only reduces the loss in the event of an incident, and has no impact on the incident proba-where organizations decide to invest in security measures other than the insurance, then I = 0. The losses resulting from the occurrence of a security incident can be written as: Taking into account (20) and (22) , the losses incurred due to a security incident can be written as:
Hosting is another example of risk transfer; in the case of hosting the organization transfers its information system (or part of its system) to the provider. In this case, L s = 0 and L
L
P 0 and L p P 0. Should an organization sign an SLA with the provider, which stipulates that the organization is entitled to compensation in the case of an incident, then I P 0. 6. Model application and possible scenarios of use 6.1. Assessment of the benefits Considering the probability function q (17) and loss L (25), the risk is calculated as:
One of the key issues in information security is how much the organization should invest in information-security oper-ations. The decision is not an easy one. The problem combines the uncertainty about the threats, the vulnerabilities, the con-sequences of a successful attack and the efficiency measures. It is important that the organization is aware that the security measures only reduce the risk to an acceptable level and that 100% security is not  X  and should not be  X  an objective.
Geer (2002) argues that security investments cannot be measured solely by a technical indicator, or by the amount of invested money, but through a systematic analysis of the costs of the security measure and the benefits of its implementation ( Schechter, 2002 ). This method is well suited to financial decision-making managers ( Nemzow, 1997 ). A cost X  X enefit analysis compares the costs of certain activities to the benefits that these activities produce ( Gordon &amp;
Loeb, 2002 , Gordon &amp; Loeb, 2006; Schechter, 2002). Let us assume that we can estimate the expected total benefits and the implementation of security measures to the point where the benefits minus the costs have the maximum value. The implementation of information-security activities beyond this point means that the marginal costs of the additional security costs) of the implementation of information security beyond the maximum point are negative. For the organization it does not make any sense to spend more for a security measure than the potential loss in the case of a security incident. However, an organization can continue to invest in security activities until the marginal benefits are equal to the marginal cost (Gor-don &amp; Loeb, 2005).

The costs for security measures can be calculated easily; this is the money that the organization spends on a particular investment, with the aim to reduce security risks. Unlike the costs, however, which are determined relatively easily, it is much harder to identify, evaluate or measure the benefits ( Hoo, 2000 ). Security measures (e.g., firewall, antivirus and IDS systems) per se do not bring financial benefits that can be measured. The most common benefits of any investment in infor-mation security are a reduction in the occurrence of incidents and, consequently, the losses caused by these incidents.
In general, the benefits of an investment in information security are commonly taken as the cost savings from reducing calculate the benefits.

Consequently, security-measure investment benefits B are considered to be equal to the risk reduction due to the imple-mentation of a security measure. In that case the following is true: duction of a security measure, d are the negative consequences of the security measure on business operations and perfor-mance. We expect that a higher level of security reduces the operational capacities of a system, thus impacting on insurance premiums, etc.). 6.2. Economic evaluation of the security measures
The economic impact of a certain measure we analyze using the cost X  X enefit approach. For this purpose the parameters of the return on investment (ROI), the net present value (NPV), and the internal rate of return (IRR) are used.
Return on investment ROI 5 compares the investment benefits and investment costs; the result is the investment profitabil-ity expressed in percentages: A positive ROI value means that the investment is economically justified.
 Net present value NPV is much more appropriate for long-term investments, because it also considers the time factor:
In this case, I denotes the discount rate and n denotes the time period. The NPV is measured in monetary units, while an investment is economically justified when NPV &gt; 0.

Internal return rate IRR enables the calculation of the discount rate at which the NPV equals zero, or in other words, the discount rate at which the present value of inflows equals the present level of outflows.
 When comparing the two security measures for the cost and benefit analysis it is necessary to consider the ROI, NPV and mal security measure from the economic prospective it is certainly advisable to consider the security measure with the solutions, the NPV of another, and the IRR of a third one. In such cases other parameters have to be considered and a decision management analysis.

The calculation presented below shows the ROI for different risk-treatment scenarios. The NPV and IRR calculations tend to be similar.
 If the selected risk-reduction strategy is an investment in a preventive security measure, the ROI equation is written as: In this case the loss L equals the specification (8) .

If the selected risk-reduction measure is to invest in a corrective security measure, then the ROI Eq. (28) has the follow-ing form:
If the selected risk-reduction measure is an investment in a detective security measure, the ROI Eq. (28) takes the fol-lowing form:
Transfer of risk to an insurance organization represents a corrective security measure, because the transfer of risk to an insurance organization does not reduce the incident X  X  probability of occurrence; it only mitigates the consequences of this incident. The equation can be simplified as follows:
Since the risk transfer to an insurance organization does not represent an intervention within the system, it means that d 0. The cost C denotes the monthly premium paid to the insurance organization. 6.3. Selection of the optimal security measure based on the economic parameters
To deepen the understanding of the solution, a simple example is presented below. Consider the case when an organiza-tion is making a decision between investments in two possible security measures s risk R A , and measure s B reduces the security risk R B . The data relating to risks A and B are presented in Table 1 :
Given the results, the organization would opt for measure B without further ado, because solution B is significantly more profitable. On the other hand, the prevention of risk A is much more important for the organization than risk B, since the requirements for business security, integrity and availability are three times greater for measure A compared to measure B.
For this purpose, an optimal business economic-security investment may be considered, which combines both the quantitative assessment of the economically optimal security measure X  X  implementation and the business security require-ments. The ROI, NPV and IRR matrices are further enlarged with parameters that reflect the business security requirements as follows:
S ( a ) is the business security requirement as defined in the security strategy. The optimal business-economic measure ma-trix developed with use of these equations is then used for a comparative analysis of the different security measures. That reduces the potential risk in cases where multiple measures are possible for a reduction of the same risk; the business secu-rity requirements remain the same; and the comparative optimal business-economic measures have equal ROI, NPV, or IRR indices.
 In the above case, both the calculated ROI values of the business-economic security measure are equal to 0.9.
The business requirements also determine the acceptable level of the remaining risk. The measure-selection procedure has to consider it, because it enables the selection of the risk treatment. In that case the following condition applies:
R min is really minimal when it comes to the highest business requirements, while it seems to be higher for lower business requirements. This assessment is useful when the price frame is required or when it is necessary to know how much a cer-tain measure deviates from an optimal selection. The method for the investment-cost assessment determines the biggest net benefit of a measure (the difference between benefits and costs). The parameters d and l are linearly dependent on the cost of the security measure C :
Since the best net benefit is looked for, the following must be true: The calculations for the preventive, corrective and detective security measures are: 6.4. Scenarios of use threats and security measures can be very complex. They are illustrated with the following scenarios.
 Scenario 1: One security measure protects against multiple threats.

Each threat attacks its own vulnerability. The security measure can protect against one or more threats. The parameters apply to all threats, with the exception of the productivity of safety measure a , which is determined for each particular threat. Because the impact of security measures during an individual risk reduction may vary. If n is the number of threats and vulnerabilities, the equation for the risk can be written as follows: Then we can calculate the ROI for the security measure: Scenario 2: One threat attacks several vulnerabilities.

Parameters related to vulnerability and losses are specific for each vulnerability. Parameters related to the threats and measures are the same for all vulnerabilities. If m is the total number of vulnerabilities that a threat can attack, the risk and ROI can be written in equations as follows: Scenario 3: Multiple threats attack a single vulnerability, each measure protects against one threat.

The parameters related to the threats and measures are specific to each threat or measure. The parameters related to the in an equation as follows:
Scenario 4: Several security measures protect against one threat.
The parameters related to the measures are specific to each measure. The parameters related to the threat, vulnerability and losses do not change. Q is the number of all measures. The risk and ROI can be written as follows:
Eqs. (46) X (53) have shown that the model is applicable to different scenarios, depending on the organization X  X  needs and the approach to the investment problem. 7. Examples
The examples used to illustrate the model application in real-life circumstances were prepared in cooperation with a company working in the area of IT. These examples were used to test the appropriateness of the model in a real business environment. Different threats were selected, such as viruses, spam, phishing, unauthorized alteration of web-page content, and denial of service. In the text that follows, the examples with the virus and the denial of service are presented. The parameters used in the calculation are the following: 7.1. Example no. 1: risk analysis of computer virus
All the employees in the company use computers and laptops on a daily basis, so infection can affect all the business pro-cesses. The company currently uses an antivirus program for the protection of workstations and servers, but the subscription and the maintenance expire in a short time. The company wishes to determine whether it should retain the current antivirus program and extend the subscription or opt for another solution. The following security parameters were taken into account during the calculation: The security risk is estimated as:
The value of the risk is not very high, meaning that the risk could be accepted, while another option is to reduce the pos-sibility that the risk will become real by investing in a security measure.
 The potential measures selected were:
Assessment of the characteristics of the selected measures, productivity and measure costs for a period of 4 years are pre-sented in Table 2 .
 An evaluation of the individual measures is presented in Table 3 and Table 4 :
The first interesting finding is that all the measures give a positive result; however, the most economically optimal choice is the measure B, followed by the measure D. The measure F follows these two. This can be explained by the finding that in the price of common measures it is not justifiable to add additional security. 7.2. Example 2: risk analysis of protection against DoS attack
The following security parameters were taken: The security risk was estimated as: The value of the risk needs to be reduced by making investments in particular security measure.
 The following possible measures were selected:
An assessment of the characteristics of the selected measures, productivity and measure costs for a time of 4 years is pre-sented in Table. 5 : Evaluations of the individual measures are presented in Table 6 and Table 7 :
The measure A gives a positive result for all the indicators. The measure B provides a quite significant negative result for all the indicators and, as a consequence, A is the optimal solution in that case. 7.3. Assessment of the model with a simulation of the incident-occurrence probability
The general applicability and usability of the presented model were tested with a mathematical simulation of a hypothet-ical model for incident occurrence. We have created an environment of real business processes, information assets, vulner-abilities, threats and security measures. The values used in the simulation process were selected from the real-life business process of an organization. The business processes involved several information assets; some of these assets were part of one process, while some of them were present in more than one business process. The assets had one or more vulnerabilities. The values indicating the vulnerabilities that were the point of the attacks were randomly selected from a predetermined range of values and denoted as the values of the parameter v . The values for the threat probabilities were randomly selected from the predetermined range of values. They were denoted as the parameter T . The security measures were supposed to protect the assets from potential attacks. The organization was aware of the possible threats, but had no information about which of the attacks will happen in the known period of time. The frequency of the attacks was not known either. For that reason, the values relating to the likelihood that an attack would happen and the possibility that this attack would result in a security incident were randomly selected. It was assumed that the security measures which the organization may apply can be pre-ventive, corrective or detective. Parameters like the productivity of a security measure, the impact of the implemented mea-sures on business operations (parameter d ) and an indirect positive effect of the implementation of the measure (parameter l ) were defined according to the real-life values that were available. These data were used later as input data in the calcu-lation of the values of the ROI, NPV and IRR for each security measure selected. The results of the simulation and the theo-retical calculation were then compared.
 The simulation of the hypothetical model was carried out with Microsoft Excel, using Visual Basic for Applications (VBAs). of this period, it was assumed that an organization may invest in a security measure because the management considered that protection of the information assets is required. The security measure in which the organization may invest was ran-domly selected from a predefined set of possible measures.

The assets of the organization with known vulnerabilities were supposed to be exposed to some fixed number of potential threats in the estimated period of 1 year. The organization had no knowledge about which attacks on a particular vulnera-not known either. The simulation process starts with a calculation of the threat probability. The Excel RAND function was used in the calculation of the threat probability. For each threat to the asset vulnerability a random number was generated and compared to the T value. If the random number had a value smaller than the value of T , then the probability of the threat occurrence was high.

The simulation process continues with a calculation of the probability of a successful attack. The generation of a random number was repeated and the resulting value was compared to the of generating random numbers was repeated 365 times (with the assumption that for each day in the year an attack explor-ing a particular vulnerability may happen). The resulting number represents the number of realized security incidents for a particular threat in 1 year.

The annual losses were calculated for all the measures selected from the random set of measures. The number of incidents that happen as a result of a threat was multiplied by the loss caused by the particular incident. The sum of the benefits and no measure exists (no selection has happen). This sum of all the potential losses was considered as the organization X  X  annual loss for all the security incidents if the organization has implemented only one selected measure from the set of possible security measures. This calculation of the potential loss with different generated random numbers was repeated 10,000 times and then an average potential loss for each measure was calculated. The obtained results were then ordered according to the size of the loss that may happen. The measure with the minimum loss was put at the top of the list of measures and the measure with the maximum loss was put at the bottom of the list. This obtained ordering of measures based on the po-tential losses was then compared with the calculated theoretical values for the ROI, NPV and IRR for the same measures that were ordered. The measure with the maximum value of the ROI, NPV or IRR was ranked as the top, while the measure with the lowest value of the ROI, NPV or IRR was put at the bottom. It was assumed that if the ordering of a particular measure obtained through a simulation of random events coincides with the ordering obtained from the theoretical model calculation then this can be considered as a proof that the theoretical model gives correct results. The comparison of both orderings has shown that the security measures with the smallest value of potential loss (meaning that they provide good assets protection from potential security incidents) from the simulated hypothetical model also have the maximum value of the ROI, NPV or
IRR calculated with the theoretical model. These are the measures denoted as measures 16, 5 and 4. However, it has to be pointed out that here an ordering is compared, as the numbers used in the ordering do not have the same notion. The cal-culation of the ROI, NPV and IRR gives information about the economic efficiency of the investment in a particular measure, and the results of the hypothetical model simulation give information about the level of savings if a specific measure is se-lected and implemented within the organization. However, the similarity of the measure ordering confirms the correctness of the theoretical model.

For the calculation of the ROI, NPV and IRR an annual rate of 0.05, as a discount rate, and an investment period of 5 years were taken into account. The obtained results are shown in Table 8 . The first row in Table 8 is labeled as  X  X  X o investment X  X , providing information about the cost that will occur due to security incidents if the organization does not invest anything in a security measure in 1 year.

A comparison of both obtained orders is given in Table 9 . The numbers in Table 9 represent the identification of individual measures from the set of measures. The measure labeled 0 means there was no investment for that measure. The value of the
ROI, NPV and IRR for non-investment is assumed to be 0%. 8. Discussion and further work
The presented methodology and associated mathematical model for the optimal selection of an investment into security can be concluded from the presented results and discussion:
The correctness of the model was evident after the comparison with the results obtained from the simulation of the prob-ability for incident occurrence and the associated annual losses. The model has proved to be appropriate for assessing the economic efficiency of the investment into a particular security measure. However, it has to be added here, that each optimal application of a security measure in a particular period does not provide an optimal solution for an undefined period of time. every day. This imposes a notion of the security dynamics and a consideration of the applied security technology lifecycle. It is obvious that every vulnerability in the organizational system that needs to be removed by use of a particular measure in the form of a technical solution has to be watched through its lifecycle, which has different phases: discovery, exploitation, has its own period of return that starts after the purchase of the solution and its installation. The investment period does not always overlap with the vulnerability lifecycle. The security ecosystem has proven in several case studies that the organizational information system protected by patches or similar technical measures often remains vulnerable over a attack systems being developed for the same vulnerability or new vulnerabilities discovered in the organization system. Very few research studies are addressing the problem of the security dynamics from the economic point of view. Most of the stud-ies are examining the vulnerability of the organization to security incidents and how to protect from them. Two general ap-proaches are used when managing the information-security risk viewed through the security incidents that happen due to known or unknown vulnerabilities ( Ryan &amp; Jefferson, 2003 ) and are considered to be part of the security dynamics. One of the approaches is to reduce the likelihood of the occurrence by reducing the vulnerability of the system, which is the ap-proach taken in the presented model. A system with low vulnerability can better prevent the occurrence of security inci-dents. The other approach is to reduce the potential impact of the security incidents by ensuring that the organization can handle the consequences of realized incidents through an investment in the capability of the team that acts as a Com-puter Emergency Response Team (CERT). Our model provides a solution for the first approach. However, in the performed study with several scenarios of use it was clearly underlined how essential it is to remain aware of the fact that information security is a process and not a product when looking for optimal security solutions; consequently, it has to be monitored and managed like any other business process.

In our further work and future development of the dynamic consideration of the model the research envisaged will be focused on the period that comes after the vulnerability lifecycle is closed. The management strategy in this context is ex-pected to be oriented towards the observation of real signs of new incidents. In that case a dynamic hypothesis about po-tential incidents may be conceptualized based on the pre-assumption that the security measure removes the appearance of security incidents related to the identified vulnerability. If more incidents are detected and the perceived information on risk rises, then a re-examination of the decision would be required and the calculation directed towards a search for a new, optimal solution or approach. The process is closely related to the capability of the organization to respond to security incidents A low investment in incident-response capability means fewer detected incidents and higher investment demands.
To verify this an organization needs a more sophisticated, hypothetical model about any possible incident occurrence in the defined period of time than was used in our study ( Richardson, 2009 ). As the incident detection and response capability are closely related to the human capital investment of the organization, the study of the security dynamics after the vulnerabil-ity lifecycle is closed and introduces a completely new dimension in the risk analysis. Consequently, this requires a new sim-ulation study of the security-measure behavior. The introduction of security dynamics into the mathematical model of the economic evaluation would considerably increase the complexity and difficulty associated with the model. The current mod-el presented above is intended for practical use. However, further work in this direction is expected and envisaged. Appendix A See Table 10 .
