 Effects of Stimulus Type and Error-Correcting Code Design on -Information theory says: increase Hamming distances in C. -Neurophysiology says: this leads to weaker brain responses. -We attempted to optimize the tradeoff between these, but found that other factors (spatial layout) are also involved. -Physical stimulus type also interacts with these effects. Given the right stimulus,
