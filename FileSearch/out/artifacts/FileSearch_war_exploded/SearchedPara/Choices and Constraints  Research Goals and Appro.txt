 All research projects begin with a goal , for instance to describe search behavio r, to predict when a person will enter a second query, or to discover which IR system performs the best. Different research goal s suggest different research approaches, ranging from field studies to lab stud ies to online experiment ation. This tutorial will provide an overview of the different types of research goals , common evaluation approaches used to address each type, and the constraints each approach entails. Participants will come away with a broad perspective of research goals and approaches in IR, a nd an understanding of the benefits and limitations of these research approaches. Th e tutorial will take place in two independent , but interrelated parts , each focusing on a unique set of research approaches but with the same intended tutorial outcomes . The se outcomes will be accomplished by deconstruct ing and analyzing our own published research papers , with further illustrations of each technique using the broader literature . By using our own research as anchors, we will provide insight about the resear ch process , revealing the difficult choices and trade -offs researchers make when designing and conducting IR studies.
 H.3. 3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval] : Information Search and Retrieval Design, Experimentation Research methods, field experiments, laboratory experiments, field observation, large -scale log analysis. Aim 1: To help participants develop a broader perspective of research goals and approaches in IR. There are three major goals of research: description, prediction and explanation. These goals naturally build on one another, and in many cases are associated with certain research approaches. In this tutorial, we would like to examine and analyze these different goals and approaches, draw attention to underrepresented goals and approaches, and encourage participants to consider pursing a variety of goals and approac hes.
 Aim 2: To improve participants X  understandings of research choices and constraints. Every research project requires researcher s to make a series of choices about a range of factors (e.g., participants, sample size, tasks, and corpus) and usually ther e are constraints that influence these choices. It can be difficult to understand the choices researchers make with regard to research design by reading published literature, as few authors explicitly state how pragmatic, professional, and personal constr aints influenced their research design choices. By using some of our own research papers, we aim to expose participants to the experiential aspects of the research process by giving them a behind the scenes view of how we make/made choices in our own resea rch. Along with discussing  X  X ow we did it X  we also want to discuss  X  X hy we did it this way. X  Aim 3: To i nspire outside -the -search -box research . We believe that contemporary IR research has come to be overly dominated by topics that can be addressed using standard test collections or dumps of tremendously large -scale search engine log data, and by search innovations that are limited to  X  X n e-degree -of-Google X  mentality. We aim to inspire new research that does not involve small improvements to systems model ed on the standard web search model. Aim 4: To p rovide guidance and references to ena ct best practices and greater openness of alternative approaches . We have observed that without formal guidance people often develop ill -informed ideas about issues such as appropriate sample size and selection and sampling of tasks that reflect real user behavior. Thus, the last goal of this tutorial is to provide participants with guidance about best practices and increase their knowledge of research design. In doing so, we hope this will foster greater awareness of, and openness to, alternative research approaches, so that when evaluating research reports participants can consider the relationship among the research goals, approaches and the researcher X  X  choices, as opposed to whether the research methods were chosen simply to mimic the status quo without regard to their appropriateness to the study goals. Part 1 will focus on experimental approaches to information retrieval research , specifically controlled laboratory studies (smaller scale user studies) and field experiments (such as A /B testing). The studies covered in this part seek to describe, predict and explain, and are essential for explanatory research that evaluates causal models. In both laboratory and field experiments, the groups studied can be characterized as  X  X reatment gr oups, X  because they are constructed as the researcher brings participants together so that their behavior can be studied under conditions that the res earcher manipulates or creates.

Part 2 will focus on observational approaches to research , specifically fie ld observations and large -scale log analysis. These types of studies primarily focus on description and prediction, and emphasize naturalness; as such, they target real groups of people in natural settings and seek to understand phenomena in context. Field observations are observational studies where people know they are being studied. Because they involve researcher intervention the design may be obtrusive, but the observations are made in people X  X  natural contexts. Large -scale log analysis is a means to capture naturalistic behavior without any active intervention. Such logs are not exclusively or explicitly collected for research purposes.
