 We propose the following two step procedure for the supervis ed bipartite graph inference: of f and g using the known bipartite graph. To do so, we require the mapp ings f and g to map extent by the nearest neighbor approach.

 we define a kind of the adjacency matrix A vertices u n where diagonal elements ( D edges involving vertices u are zero, and the sizes of the matrices are n Let us denote by f the values taken by f and g on the training set. If we restrict f P H regularization operators. Let us define by || f || and || g || the norms of f and g in H the regularized criterion to be minimized becomes: where  X  original criterion (1) and ensuring that the solution has a s mall norm in the r.k.h.s. d the p -th features f under the orthogonality constraints: f  X  f 3.2 Algorithm Let k H equation (4) has the following expansions: for some vector  X  Let K g f and g in H constraints for f and g can be written as  X  T K f  X  f q and g p  X  g q ( p 6 = q ) can be written by  X  T p K u  X  q = 0 and  X  T p K v  X  q = 0 .
