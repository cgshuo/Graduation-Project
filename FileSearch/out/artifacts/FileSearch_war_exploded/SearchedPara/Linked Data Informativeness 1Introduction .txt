 The Semantic Web is a major evolution to the current World Wide Web (WWW) that provides machine-readable and meaningful representation of Web content. Formal knowledge representation languages such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) [1] and OWL (Ontology Web Language) [2], and query languages such as SPARQL [3] are key enablers of semantic applicatio ns. These technologies enable the Web of Data, a giant graph of interconnected information resources, known as Linked Data. 
Based on the principles of the Linking Open Data (LOD) project, an extensive knowledge bases such as DBpedia 1 , which is the Semantic Web-based representation of Wikipedia 2 [5], to domain-specific datasets such as Geo Names 3 and Bio2RDF 4 . According to the Linking Open Data cloud 5 , more than 295 datasets in various domains, including Geography, Publications, Life Sciences, and so on are now interconnected together. This valuable source of semantic knowledge can be exploited in practical and innovative applications. It has also introduced several research opportunities. 
Due to the fact that most of Linked Datasets have been created by automatic or semi-automatic extraction of structured data from Web pages, assessing the quality of the Web of Data has become a critical challenge for semantic data consumption. Moreover, not all available Linked Data is valuable for semantic software agents or human understanding. For example, it is likely that among all relations available in the Web of Data relating to a particular movie, its director and actors are more inter-esting to most users than its language or runtime. Likewise, for a software agent that compares two movies, having a same director conveys more information than sharing a same language. Understanding the informativeness of resources and structured data associated with them facilitates browsing as well as automatic consumption and inter-pretation of Linked Data. This paper, introduces two novel metrics to evaluate the amount of information that a resource and its relations carry. After proposing the metrics, we present a set of experiments conducted in various domains and applica-tions in order to demonstrate their characteristics. In this section, we first introduce the co ncept of informativeness measurement accord-ing to its mathematical theory. Then, by formalizing the definition of Linked Data, we propose metrics to assess the value of information in the Web of Data. 2.1 Measuring the Information Content Information Theory describes the mathematical foundation of communication for transmitting an information source over a communication channel by means of cod-ding schemes [6, 7]. Shannon [8] proposed entropy as a measure of information con-tained in a process. He showed that entropy, also known as Information Content (IC) or Self-Information , is the amount of binary symbols or bits that the receiver needs in order to recreate the original transmitted process. Derived from the probability theory paradigm, Information Content is defined as the engendered amount of surprise [9]: where  X   X  a  X  is the probability of presence of term or concept  X  in a given corpora. The the base 10 and natural logarithms, the unit is bans and nats, respectively. 
By looking closely at this metric, we can describe its important characteristics. The amount of surprise evoked by occurrence of a particular term has a negative correla-more probable and therefore, there is less surprise in their occurrence. In other words, less frequent entities are more specific and informative than common terms. 2.2 Formal Description of Linked Data In order to be able to present a systematic approach for Linked Data analysis, we mathematically explain and formalize the Web of Data based on a combination of graph and set theories. Linked Data is a labele d directed graph consists of resources as nodes and relations as edges that are identifiable by their URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). Thus, nodes, edges, and the dir ections of edges have to be considered for a proper representation of Linked Data and its resources: Definition 1 (Linked Data Graph): Linked Data is a labeled directed graph LD, de-resource  X  to resource  X  . Therefore, incoming and outgoing edges can be used to describe a resource: Definition 2 (A Resource in Linked Data): A resource  X  X  X  in Linked Data LD is represented as its set of features  X  , which is defined as: 2.3 Informativeness of Resources in Linked Data By deriving from the formal definition of Linked Data and the principles of informa-tion theory, we propose a metric to measure the value of information associated with resources in the Web of Data. According to the Definition 2, each resource is represented as its set of characteristics, which is a collection of its incoming and out-going edges. Based on the basis of the probability theory, we define the surprise value associated with a resource in Linked Data: Definition 3 (Probability of a Resource in Linked Data): For a resource such as  X   X   X  , represented as a set of features  X  X  X  X  X   X   X ,  X   X ,..., |  X  |  X  , the probability of  X  is Thus, we have Based on this, we define the Partitioned Information Content : Definition 4 (Partitioned Information Content for Linked Data): Information Content of a resource is defined as the sum of the Information Content values of its features: where IC of each feature is calculated using the Equation (1): such that  X   X   X   X   X  is the frequency of the feature  X   X  and  X  is the frequency of the most common feature in a given Linked Dataset. 
In this definition, the amount of information conveyed by a given resource is calcu-lated according to the probability of its features. Popular features carry less informa-tion while specific ones are more informative. This metric also allows us to study the Web of Data in terms of the value of information contained in each resource and do-main. It highlights the most informative and influential information sources among a large number of available resources in a particular domain. 2.4 Informativeness of Relations in Linked Data Another key component of Linked Data is relations, also known as properties. Under-standing the importance and informativeness of relations allows better automatic in-terpretation and enhanced filtering of Linked Data. From the users X  perspective, it supports information browsing and visualization by identifying the most significant properties in a particular domain. The informativeness of a given property is indicated by measuring the value of information produced by the relation in a given context: Definition 5 (Generated Information Content of Relations): Let  X   X   X   X  and  X   X   X  X  be the subset of all features that have  X   X   X  X   X  as their link: The domain could be the whole Linked Data graph or a subset of it that is filtered by a search query. This metric enables us to indicate the most important relations that con-vey the highest amount of information about resources inside a particular domain. 3.1 Experimental Context The main Linked Dataset used in our experiments was DBpedia. We downloaded the main DBpedia Ontology as well as five fundamental datasets in English, including Ontology Infobox Properties, Ontology Infobox Types, Article Categories, SKOS Categories, and YAGO Links. Finally, by simultaneous executing of a number of SPARQL queries, we extracted instances and their features from the DBpedia dataset in three domains: Music, Actors, and Films (see Table 1). 
At the time of writing this paper (October 2012), the latest version of DBpedia was Equation (6) was set as the number of (rdf:type, owl:thing) relations (2,350,906). 3.2 Distribution of Informat ion in Different Domains The first experiment was performed using the Partitioned Information Content-based metric in order to compare information distribution across several domains in DBpe-dia. It is observable that information in th e Music domain is more distributed than the others, with standard deviation of 590.2 in comparison to 148.2 for Films and 437.6 for Actors (see Fig. 1 (a) and Fig. 2). Moreover, there is more distinctive information available for musical artists and actors than films (Fig. 1 (b)). This may be explained by the fact that each artist has an increasing number of outputs during their career. 
Further experiments were performed in order to compare the informativeness of semantic data provided by various Linked Datasets. LinkedMDB 6 (Linked Movie Database) is a specialized open Linked Data for movies [10]. It provides structured information for 85,600 movies described using more than 6 million triples 7 . The expe-riments illustrate a wider distribution of information in LinkedMDB in comparison to the Films dataset extracted from DBpedia (see Fig. 2). Comparing these figures un-derline the difference between the qualities of structured information provided by DBpedia, which is a general purpose Linked Data, against LinkedMDB. 3.3 Applications to Faceted Browsing and Information Filtering Information filtering techniques help users to overcome data overload by facilitating browsing and exploring the knowledge base. Facets improve semantic data browsers by providing suggestions according to the currently viewed item. We applied the proposed metrics to discover the most relevant resources to a given instance. Table 2 lists the top 10 recommended artists and bands when the user browses a specific domain. 
Another application of the metrics is to identify the most important relations in Generated Information Content. These properties hold the most valuable and distinc-tive information about instances. It is useful especially for Linked Data browsers and search engines to allow users easily navigate through a large collection of results. Since being introduced by Resnik [11], Information Content-based metrics have been widely exploited for semantic similarity measurement between concepts in lexical taxonomies [12-15]. These metrics demonstrated better performance than convention-al edge-counting and feature-based methods. However, the notion of informativeness has been rarely used in Linked Data. Cheng et al. [16] embed the mutual information of resources into a random surfer model and present an approach for centrality-based summarization of entities in Linked Data. 
A number of metrics have been developed to analyze the Web of Data from vari-ous aspects. Ell et al. [17] propose metrics to evaluate labels in Linked Data in terms of completeness, unambiguity, and multilinguality. Gu X ret et al. [18] apply network analysis techniques to measure and improve the robustness of Linked Data graph. Another series of research has been carried out for entity ranking in Linked Data. Although traditional graph-based ranking methods, such as PageRank [19], SimRank [20], and HITS [21], can also be applied to the link structure of the Web of Data, its semantics, represented using various relation types, will not be taken into account. Numerous studies have attempted to extend the existing algorithms to consider link types in the rating methodology [22-27]. ObjectRank [22] adds link weights to Page-Rank for ranking in a directed labeled graph. Bamba and Mukherjea [23] extend PageRank to arrange the results of Semantic Web queries. TripleRank [26] is a gene-ralization of the authority (importance) an d connectivity (hub) scores of HITS algo-rithm for Linked Data, with applications in faceted browsing. These methods rate the importance of resources according to the link structure of the Web of Data graph while our approach is based on the amount of useful information that each individual resource and relation conveys. Nevertheless, further research needs to be done to assess the performance of different algorithms in terms of ranking functionality. In this paper, we addressed the problem of Linked Data quality assessment, which has a significant impact on the performance of Semantic Web applications. By relying on the principles of information theory, we have developed two metrics, namely Parti-tioned Information Content (PIC) and Generated Information Content (GIC), for mea-suring the informativeness of resources and relations in Linked Data. We analyzed the Web of Data using the metrics in several domains. As it was demonstrated in the ex-periments, assessing the quality of information contained in Linked Data offers the potential for its deployment in a variety of applications including information filter-ing, multi-faceted browsing, search engines, and entity ranking. Moreover, it can also be exploited for Linked Data clustering and visualization to highlight the most impor-tant information sources and relations. Currently, we are verifying and evaluating the proposed metrics in a range of application areas. We are also devising them in order to enable further analysis and comparison of resources in the Web of Data.
