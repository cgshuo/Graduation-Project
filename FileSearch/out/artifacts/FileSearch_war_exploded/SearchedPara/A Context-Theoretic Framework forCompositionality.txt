 be described within our framework. 1. Introduction
This article presents the thesis that defining meaning as context leads naturally to a model in which meanings of strings are represented as elements of an associative algebra over the real numbers, and entailment is described by a vector lattice ordering.
This model is general enough to encompass several proposed methods of composition in vector-based representations of meaning.
 the development of techniques to analyze statistical properties of words. For example techniques such as latent semantic analysis (Deerwester et al. 1990) and its variants, and measures of distributional similarity (Lin 1998; Lee 1999), attempt to derive aspects of the meanings of words by statistical analysis, and statistical information is often used when parsing to determine sentence structure (Collins 1997). These techniques have proved useful in many applications within computational linguistics and natural language processing (Grefenstette 1994; Sch  X  utze 1998; Bellegarda 2000; Choi, Wiemer-
Hastings, and Moore 2001; Lin 2003; McCarthy et al. 2004), arguably providing evidence that they capture something about the nature of words that should be included in representations of their meaning. However, it is very difficult to reconcile these tech-niques with existing theories of meaning in language, which revolve around logical and ontological representations. The new techniques, almost without exception, can be viewed as dealing with vector-based representations of meaning, placing meaning (at least at the word level) within the realm of mathematics and algebra; conversely the older theories of meaning dwell in the realm of logic and ontology. It seems there is no unifying theory of meaning to provide guidance to those making use of the new techniques.
 the whole foundation of meaning seems to be in question. The older, logical theories often subscribe to a model-theoretic philosophy of meaning (Kamp and Reyle 1993;
Blackburn and Bos 2005). According to this approach, sentences should be translated to vector-based techniques, on the other hand, are often closer in spirit to the philosophy of meaning as context , the idea that the meaning of an expression is determined by how said that  X  X eaning just is use, X  Firth X  X  (1968)  X  X ou shall know a word by the company it keeps, X  and the distributional hypothesis of Harris (1968), that words will occur in similar contexts if and only if they have similar meanings. This hypothesis is justified by the success of techniques such as latent semantic analysis as well as experimental evidence (Miller and Charles 1991). Although the two philosophies are not obviously incompatible X  X specially because the former applies mainly at the sentence level and the latter mainly at the word level X  X t is not clear how they relate to each other. recently received increased attention (Clark, Coecke, and Sadrzadeh 2008; Mitchell and
Lapata 2008; Widdows 2008; Erk and Pad  X  o 2009; Baroni and Zamparelli 2010; Guevara 2011; Preller and Sadrzadeh 2011) although the problem has been considered in earlier work (Smolensky 1990; Landauer and Dumais 1997; Foltz, Kintsch, and Landauer 1998;
Kintsch 2001). A solution to this problem would have practical as well as philosophical benefits. Current techniques such as latent semantic analysis work well at the word level, but we cannot extend them much beyond this, to the phrase or sentence level, without quickly encountering the data-sparseness problem: There are not enough occur-rences of strings of words to determine what their vectors should be merely by looking in corpora. If we knew how such vectors should compose then we would be able to extend the benefits of the vector based techniques to the many applications that require reasoning about the meaning of phrases and sentences.
 these two paradigms, introduced in the author X  X  DPhil thesis (Clarke 2007). In addition, we also discuss the relationship between this theory and methods of composition that have recently been proposed in the literature, showing that many of them can be considered as falling within our framework.

In developing the framework we were looking for specific properties; namely, we wanted it to:
The framework we present is abstract, and hence does not subscribe to a particular method for obtaining word vectors: They may be raw frequency counts, or vectors ob-tained by a method such as latent semantic analysis. Nor does the framework provide a recipe for how to represent meaning in natural language; instead it provides restrictions are used in a way that is well-founded in a theory of meaning. For example, given vector representations of words, there is not one single way of combining these to give vector representations of phrases and sentences, but in order to fit within the framework there are certain properties of the representation that need to hold. Any method of combining these vectors in which these properties hold can be considered within the framework and is thus justified according to the underlying theory; in addition the framework instructs us as to how to measure the degree of entailment between strings according to that particular method.
 framework is not merely to demonstrate the generality of our framework: In doing so, we identify previously ignored features of this work such as the lattice structure within the vector space. This allows any one of these approaches to be endowed with an entailment property defined by this lattice structure, based on a philosophy of meaning as context.
 scribed within the framework and show some of its potential, they cannot demonstrate its full power. The mathematical structures we make use of are extremely general, and we hope that in the future many interesting discoveries will be made by exploring the realm we identify here.
 however, we believe this approach has many potential benefits, because approaches to composition which may have been considered unrelated (such as the tensor product and vector addition) are now shown to be related. This means that when studying such constructions, work can be avoided by considering the general case, for the same reason that class inheritance aids code reuse. For example, definitions given in terms of the framework can be applied to all instances, such as our definition of a degree of entailment. We also hope to motivate people to prove theorems in terms of the framework, having demonstrated its wide applicability.
 introducing the necessary definitions, and showing how related work fits into the framework. In Section 3 we introduce our motivating example, showing that a simple mathematical definition of the notions of  X  X orpus X  and  X  X ontext X  leads to an instance of our framework. In Section 4, we describe specific instances of our framework in application to the task of recognizing textual entailment. In Section 5 we show how the 44 sophisticated approach of Clark, Coecke, and Sadrzadeh (2008) can be described within our framework. Finally, in Section 6 we present our conclusions and plans for further work. 2. Context Theory
In this section, we define the fundamental concept of our concern, a context theory, and discuss its properties. The definition is an abstraction of both the more commonly used methods of defining composition in vector-based semantics and our motivating example of meaning as context, described in the next section. Because of its relation to this motivating example, a context theory can be thought of as a hypothesis describing in what contexts all strings occur.
 Definition 1 (Context Theory) A context theory is a tuple A , A ,  X  , V ,  X  , where A is a set (the alphabet), algebra over the real numbers,  X  is a function from A to A space, and  X  is an injective linear map from A to V .
 as we proceed. We assume the reader is familiar with linear algebra; see Halmos (1974) for definitions that are not included here. 2.1 Algebra over a Field
We have identified an algebra over a field (or simply algebra when there is no am-biguity) as an important construction because it generalizes nearly all the methods of vector-based composition that have been proposed. An algebra adds a multiplication operation to a vector space; the vector space is intended to describe meaning, and it is this multiplication operation that defines the composition of meaning in context-theoretic semantics.
 Definition 2 (Algebra over a Field)
An algebra over a field is a vector space A over a field K together with a binary operation ( a , b )  X  ab on A that is bilinear, and associative, ( ab ) c = a ( bc ) for all a , b , c  X  A place the requirement that an algebra is associative, in which case our definition would algebras, where K is the field of real numbers, R .
 Example 1
The square real-valued matrices of order n form a real unital associative algebra under standard matrix multiplication. The vector operations are defined entry-wise. The unity element of the algebra is the identity matrix. (2010), who suggest using matrix multiplication as a framework for distributional semantic composition. The main differences in our proposal are as follows. strings of words. Considering only the multiplication of A operations), A is a monoid, because we assumed that the multiplication on ciative. Then  X  induces a monoid homomorphism a  X   X  a from A mapped value of a  X  A  X  by  X  a  X  A , which is defined as follows: the mapping defined by  X  allows us to associate an element of the algebra with every string of words.
 is that meanings can be represented by elements of an algebra, and that the type of composition that can be defined using an algebra is general enough to describe the composition of meaning in natural language. To go some way towards justifying this, we give several examples of algebras that describe methods of composition that have been proposed in the literature: namely, point-wise multiplication (Mitchell and Lapata 2008), vector addition (Landauer and Dumais 1997; Foltz, Kintsch, and Landauer 1998), and the tensor product (Smolensky 1990; Clark and Pulman 2007; Widdows 2008). Example 2 (Point-wise Multiplication)
Consider the n -dimensional real vector space R n . We describe a vector u of its components as ( u 1 , u 2 , ... u n ) with each u i this space by
Table 1 shows a simple example of possible occurrences for three terms in three different define the mapping  X  from terms to vectors. Thus, in this example, we have  X  ( cat ) = (0,2,3)and  X  ( big ) = (1, 3, 0). Under point-wise multiplication, we would have 46 meaning is vector addition. As noted by Rudolph and Giesbrecht (2010), this can be described using matrix multiplication, by embedding an n -dimensional vector u into a matrix of order n + 1: the algebra of matrices of order n + 1. A subalgebra of an algebra of
A which is closed under the multiplication of A . This subalgebra can be equivalently described as follows: Example 3 (Additive Algebra)
For two vectors u = (  X  , u 1 , u 2 , ... u n )and v = (  X  , v additive product by
To verify that this multiplication makes R n + 1 an algebra, we can directly verify the bilinear and associativity requirements, or check that it is isomorphic to the subalgebra of matrices discussed previously.
 where the first component is 1, so  X  + ( big ) = (1,1,3,0)and  X  meaning in natural language because they are commutative; although it is often useful to consider the simpler, commutative case, natural language itself is inherently non-commutative. One obvious method of composing vectors that is not commutative is the tensor product . This method of composition can be viewed as a product in an algebra by considering the tensor algebra , which is formed from direct sums of all tensor powers of a base vector space.

Halmos [1974] for definitions); we recall their basic properties here. Let V vector space of dimensionality n (note that all vector spaces of a fixed dimensionality are isomorphic). Then the tensor product space V n  X  V m is isomorphic to a space V dimensionality nm ; moreover, given orthonormal bases B =
C = { c 1 , c 2 , ... , c m } for V m there is an orthonormal basis for V Example 4
The multiplicative models of Mitchell and Lapata (2008) correspond to the class of finite dimensional algebras. Let A be a finite-dimensional vector space. Then every associative bilinear product on A can be described by a linear function T from required in Mitchell and Lapata X  X  model. To see this, consider the action of the product on two orthonormal basis vectors a and b of A . This is a vector in direct sum is like adding them; the space V n  X  V m has dimensionality n + m and has basis vectors it is usual to write b  X  0as b and 0  X  c as c .
 Example 5 (Tensor Algebra) by V ,as: where we assume that the direct sum is commutative. We can think of it as the direct sum of all tensor powers of V ,with R representing the zeroth power. In order to make this space an algebra, we define the product on elements of these tensor powers, viewed as subspaces of the tensor algebra, as their tensor product. This is enough to define the product on the whole space, because every element can be written as a sum of tensor powers of elements of V . There is a natural embedding from V to T ( V ), where each element maps to an element in the first tensor power. Thus for example we can think of u , u  X  v ,and u  X  v + w as elements of T ( V ), for all u , v , w Taking V = R 3 and using  X  as the natural embedding from the context vector of a string
T ( V ), our previous example becomes where the last two lines demonstrate how a vector in R 3  X  R isomorphic space R 9 . 48 2.2 Vector Lattices
The next part of the definition specifies an abstract Lebesgue space. This is a special kind of vector lattice, or even more generally, a partially ordered vector space. This an important part of our thesis is that the partial ordering can be interpreted as an entailment relation.
 Definition 3 (Partially Ordered Vector Space)  X  such that: on V . An element u of V satisfying u  X  0 is called a positive element ;thesetofall a vector lattice or Riesz space .
 Example 6 (Lattice Operations on R n )
A vector lattice captures many properties that are inherent in real vector spaces when v as sequences of numbers: u = ( u 1 , u 2 , ... u n )and v = ( v define the lattice operations of meet  X  and join  X  as ordering is then given by u  X  v if and only if u  X  v = u , or equivalently u n . A graphical depiction of the meet operation is shown in Figure 2.

The vector operations of addition and multiplication by scalar, which can be defined in a similar component-wise fashion, are nevertheless independent of the particular basis chosen. Conversely, the lattice operations depend on the choice of basis, so the operations as defined herein would behave differently if the components were written using a different basis. We argue that it makes sense for us to consider these properties guished basis: namely, the one defined by the contexts in which terms occur. Of course it is true that techniques such as latent semantic analysis introduce a new basis which does not have a clear interpretation in relation to contexts; nevertheless they nearly always identify a distinguished basis which we can use to define the lattice operations. Because our aim is a theory of meaning as context, we should include in our theory a description of the lattice structure which arises out of consideration of these contexts. a theory of meaning X  X  theory of meaning must allow us to interpret these vectors. In particular it should be able to tell us whether one meaning entails or implies another; the measurement of similarity or distance, through an inner product or metric; this is a symmetric relation, however, and so cannot be suitable for describing entailment. in fact it is a Boolean algebra, which is a special kind of lattice. It seems natural to in computational linguistics can be used to model entailment.
 language meaning, however the vectors are obtained. Given this assumption, we can we would expect from this relation.
 where the vectors for terms are simply their frequencies of occurrences in n different contexts, so that they are vectors in R n . In this case, the relation  X  ( x ) that y occurs at least as frequently as x in every context. This means that y occurs in distributional hypothesis of Harris (1968).
 by Weeds, Weir, and McCarthy (2004) and developed by Geffet and Dagan (2005). A contexts that y occurs in. The idea is that distributional generality may be connected to express generality of concepts in ontologies; for example, the term animal is a hypernym of dog because a dog is an animal. Weeds, Weir, and McCarthy (2004, p. 1019) explain the connection to distributional generality as follows: be considered a stronger version of distributional generality, where the additional 50 requirement is on the frequency of occurrences. In practice, this assumption is unlikely to be compatible with the ontological view of entailment. For example the term entity is semantically more general than the term animal ; however, entity is unlikely to occur more frequently in each context, because it is a rarer word. A more realistic foundation for this assumption might be if we were to consider the components for a word to represent the plausibility of observing the word in each context. The question then, of course, is how such vectors might be obtained. Another possibility is to attempt to weight components in such a way that entailment becomes a plausible interpretation for the partial ordering relation.
 relation will hold between any two strings, because u  X  v iff u u a Bayesian perspective on this, and suggest that the degree of entailment should take the form of a conditional probability. In order to define this, however, we need some probability, by requiring it to be an abstract Lebesgue space.
 Definition 4 (Banach Lattice)
A Banach lattice V is a vector lattice together with a norm with respect to  X  .
 Definition 5 (Abstract Lebesgue Space)
An abstract Lebesgue (or AL) space is a Banach lattice V such that for all u , v in V with u  X  0, v  X  0and u  X  v = 0.
 Example 7 ( p Spaces)
Let u = ( u 1 , u 2 , ... ) be an infinite sequence of real numbers. We can view u space ; it is a vector space where the operations are defined component-wise. We define a set of norms, the p -norms, on the space of all such vectors by
The space of all vectors u for which u p is finite is called the as vector spaces, these are Banach spaces, because they are complete with respect to the associated norm, and under the component-wise lattice operations, they are Banach lattices. In particular, the 1 space is an abstract Lebesgue space under the the sequence spaces (consisting of vectors in which all but n components are zero) and, because they are finite-dimensional, we can use any of the examples, in which  X  mapped terms to vectors in R n , can be considered as mapping to abstract Lebesgue spaces if we adopt the 1 norm. 2.3 Degrees of Entailment
We propose that in vector-based semantics, a degree of entailment is more appropriate than a black-and-white observation of whether or not entailment holds. If we think of the vectors as describing  X  X egrees of meaning, X  it makes sense that we should then look for degrees of entailment.

P ( B | A ) = 1. Moreover, if A and B are mutually exclusive, then P ( A is thus natural to think of conditional probability as a degree of entailment. the set operations of a probability space are replaced by the lattice operations of the vector space. This means that we can think of an abstract Lebesgue space as a vector-based probability space. Here, events correspond to positive elements with the norm always assume is the 1 norm), and the joint probability of two events u and v is u Definition 6 (Degree of Entailment) We define the degree to which u entails v in the form of a conditional probability:
If we are only interested in degrees of entailment (i.e., conditional probabilities) and not probabilities, then we can drop the requirement that the norm should be less than or equal to one, because conditional probabilities are automatically normalized. This definition, together with the multiplication of the algebra, allows us to compute the degree of entailment between any two strings according to the context theory. Example 8
The vectors given in Table 1 give the following calculation for the degree to which cat entails animal : entailment relates to more familiar notions of entailment. There are three main ways in which the term entailment is used: 52
Our context-theoretic notion of entailment is thus intended to generalize both the first two senses of entailment given here. In addition, we hope that context theories will be of entailment is not our initial aim because we are interested in foundational issues, and doing well at this task poses major engineering challenges beyond the scope of our work. Nevertheless, we believe the ability to represent the preceding two types of entailment as well as standard distributional methods of composition bodes well for the possibility of using our framework for this task. In Section 4 we describe several basic approaches to textual entailment within the framework.
 entailment, however, as it allows the measurement of a degree of entailment between any two strings: As an extreme example, one may measure the degree to which not a entails in the . Although this may not be useful or philosophically meaningful, we view our model, which coincides with the current practice in vector-based compositionality techniques (Clark, Coecke, and Sadrzadeh 2008; Widdows 2008). 2.4 Lattice Ordered Algebras
A lattice ordered algebra merges the lattice ordering of the vector space V with the product of A . This structure encapsulates the ordering properties that are familiar from multiplication in matrices and elementary arithmetic. For this reason, many proposed methods of composing vector-based representations of meaning can be viewed as lattice ordered algebras. The only reason we have not included it as a requirement of the framework is because our motivating example (described in the next section) is not guaranteed to have this property, although it does give us a partially ordered algebra. Definition 7 (Partially Ordered Algebra)
A partially ordered algebra A is an algebra which is also a partially ordered vector
A is called a lattice-ordered algebra .
 Example 9 (Lattice-Ordered Algebra of Matrices)
The matrices of order n form a lattice-ordered algebra under normal matrix multi-plication, where the lattice operations are defined as the entry-wise minimum and maximum.
 Example 10 (Operators on p Spaces) tice property extends to operators on certain infinite-dimensional spaces, the by the Riesz-Kantorovich theorem (Abramovich and Aliprantis 2002). The operations are defined by: A , A ,  X  , A ,1 is a context theory. In this simplified situation, vector lattice as well as the algebra;  X  maps from A to A identity map on A . Many of the examples we discuss will be of this form, so we will use the shorthand notation, A , A ,  X  . It is tempting to adopt this as the definition of context theory; as we will see in the next section, however, this is not supported by our prototypical example of a context theory as in this case the algebra is not necessarily lattice-ordered. 3. Context Algebras
In this section we describe the prototypical examples of a context theory, the context algebras . The definition of a context algebra originates in the idea that the notion of  X  X eaning as context X  can be extended beyond the word level to strings of arbitrary syntactic monoid of a formal language: Instead of a set of strings defining the language, languages in our theory. We attach a real number to each string which is intended as an indication of its importance or likelihood of being observed; for example, those with a value of zero are considered not to occur.
 Definition 8 (Real-Valued Language)
Let A be a finite set of symbols. A real-valued language (or simply a language when thereisnoambiguity) L on A is a function from A  X  to R . If the range of L is a subset of
R called a fuzzy language .If L is a positive language such that probability distribution over A  X  ,a distributional language .

 to the sequence space, and we shall treat them equivalently. We denote by set of functions with a finite p norm when considered as sequences. There is another hierarchy of spaces given by the inclusion of the p spaces: particular, 54 where the  X  norm gives the maximum value of the function and space U to another V is called bounded if there exists some  X &gt; 0suchthat Tu hand side is in U .

If L  X  1 ( A  X  ) + (the space of positive functions on A  X  of the function is finite) then we can define a probability distribution p p on A  X  ) then we can define a fuzzy language f L by f L ( x ) = L ( x ) / L  X  . Example 11
Given a finite set of strings C  X  A  X  , which we may imagine to be a corpus of documents, all possible documents that could ever be written.
 Example 12
Let L be a language such that L ( x ) = 0 for all but a finite subset of A for all p .

L /  X  1 ( A  X  ) with respect to this language. As in a syntactic monoid, we consider the context to be everything surrounding the string, although in this case instead of a set of pairs of strings we have a function from pairs of strings to the real numbers. We emphasize the vector nature of these real-valued functions by calling them  X  X ontext vectors. X  Our for the context-theoretic framework.
 Definition 9 (Context Vectors)
Let L be a language on A . For x  X  A  X  , we define the context of x as a vector  X  x of  X  x ( y , z ) is the value of x in the context ( y , z ), which is L ( yxz ). the context vectors of strings in A  X  such that  X  x  X   X  y = xy where x , y multiplication in the algebra? As a first try, consider the vector space L space such that the condition just specified holds? Example 15
Consider the language C on the alphabet A = { a , b , c , d , e , f
C ( aecd ) = C ( abfd ) = 1 3 and C ( x ) = 0 for all other x as the pair of strings itself then
It would thus seem sensible to define multiplication of contexts so that ( ab , d ) = 1 3 ( a , d ). However we then find showing that this definition of multiplication doesn X  X  provide us with what we are looking for. In fact, if there did exist a way to define multiplication on contexts in a satisfactory manner it would necessarily be far from intuitive, as, in this example, we would have to define ( a , cd )  X  ( ab , d ) = 0 meaning the product have a non-zero component derived from the products of context vectors ( a , fd )and multiplication on a subspace of L  X  ( A  X   X  A  X  ).
 Definition 10 (Generated Subspace A ) The subspace A of L  X  ( A  X   X  A  X  ) is the set defined by
In other words, it is the space of all vectors formed from linear combinations of context vectors.
 {  X  u : u  X  B } where B  X  A  X  , and we can define multiplication on this basis by  X  u where u , v  X  B . Defining multiplication on this basis defines it for the whole vector subspace, because we define multiplication to be linear, making sponding to a different subset of A  X  , and each giving rise to a different definition of multiplication. Remarkably, this isn X  X  a problem.
 Proposition 1 (Context Algebra) Multiplication on A is the same irrespective of the choice of basis B . Proof We say B  X  A  X  defines a basis B for A when B is a basis such that Assume there are two sets B 1 , B 2  X  A  X  that define corresponding bases
A . We will show that multiplication in basis B 1 isthesameasinthebasis 56
Note that  X  u 1 = i  X  i  X  v i means that L ( xu 1 y ) = i the special case where y = u 2 y so for all x , y  X  A  X  . Similarly, we have L ( xu 2 y ) = j cludes the special case x = x v i ,so L ( x v i u 2 y ) = ing this into Equation (36) yields for all x , y  X  A  X  which we can rewrite as
Conversely, the product of u 1 and u 2 using the basis B 2 thus showing that multiplication is defined independently of what we choose as the basis.
 Example 16
Returning to the previous example, we can see that in this case multiplication is in fact vectors: thus confirming what we predicted about the product of  X  b and  X  c : The value is only correct because of the negative correction from ( a , fd ) to demonstrate an important property of context algebras: They do not satisfy the greater than or equal to zero) to have a non-positive product. This means they are not necessarily partially ordered algebras under the normal partial order. Compare this to the case of matrix multiplication, for example, where the product of two positive matrices is always positive. context vectors. So far we have shown that multiplication can be defined on the vector space A generated by context vectors of strings; we have not discussed the lattice properties of the vector space, however. In fact, A does not come with a natural lattice ordering that makes sense for our purposes, although the original space it is isomorphic to the sequence space. Thus A , A ,  X  , R of A to themselves, but are considered as elements of R A  X   X  caveat here, however: We required that the vector lattice be an abstract Lebesgue space, which means we need to be able to define a norm on it. The the underlying language L becomes important.
 distributional languages, would guarantee that the norm is finite. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as the following example demonstrates.
 Example 17 Let L be the language defined by for integer n  X  0, and zero otherwise, where by a n we mean n repetitions of a ,so for example, L ( a ) = 1 2 , L ( aa ) = 1 4 , L ( aaa ) = 0, and L ( aaaa ) = distribution over A  X  , because L is positive and L 1 = 1. However,  X  a there are an infinite number of such strings.
 we restrict ourselves to distributional languages in which the average string length is finite, then the problem goes away.
 Proposition 2
Let L be a probability distribution over A  X  such that average length . Then  X  y 1 is finite for each y  X  A  X  .
 Proof
Denote the number of occurrences of string y as a substring of string x by | x | and so  X  y 1  X   X  L is finite for all y  X  A  X  .
 is a context theory, where  X  is the canonical map from A to 58 context theories. 3.1 Discussion
The benefit of the context-theoretic framework is in providing a space of exploration for models of meaning in language. Our effort has been in finding principles by which to define the boundaries of this space. Each of the key boundaries, namely, bilinearity and associativity of multiplication and entailment through vector lattice structure, can also be viewed as limitations of the model.
 the way meaning is represented in the model. It can be interpreted loosely as follows:
Components of meaning persist or diminish but do not spontaneously appear. This is particularly counterintuitive in the case of idiom and metaphor in language. It means that, for example, both red and herring must contain some components relating to the meaning of red herring which only come into play when these two words are combined in this particular order. Any other combination would give a zero product for these components. It is easy to see how this requirement arises from a context-theoretic perspective, nevertheless from a linguistic perspective it is arguably undesirable. rather syntactic restrictions are encoded into the vector space and product itself. For example, we may assume the word square has some component of meaning in common with the word shape . Then we would expect this component to be preserved in the
The box is square and *The box is shape we would expect the second to be represented by the zero vector because it is not grammatical; square can be a noun and an adjective, whereas shape cannot. Distributivity of meaning means that the component of meaning that square has in common with shape must be disjoint with the adjectival component of the meaning of square .

 it may be that with time, or for certain applications, there is a reason to expand or found to be too restrictive to model certain linguistic phenomena. 4. Applications to Textual Entailment
In this section we analyze approaches to the problem of recognizing textual entailment, showing how they can be related to the context-theoretic framework, and discussing potential new approaches that are suggested by looking at them within the framework.
We first discuss some simple approaches to textual entailment based on subsequence matching and measuring lexical overlap. We then look at the approach of Glickman and Dagan (2005), showing that it can be considered as a context theory in which words are represented as projections on the vector space of documents. This leads us to an implementation of our own in which we used latent Dirichlet allocation as an alternative approach to overcoming the problem of data sparseness.
 work. Although there is no immediate practical benefit to be gained from this, our main purpose in doing this is to demonstrate the generality of the framework. We also hope that insight into these approaches may be gleaned by viewing them from a new perspective. 4.1 Subsequence Matchin gand Lexical Overlap
A sequence x  X  A  X  is a subsequence of y  X  A  X  if each element of x occurs in y in the same order, but with the possibility of other elements occurring in between, so for example abba is a subsequence of acabcba in { a , b , c }  X  the subsequences of two sequences: The more subsequences they have in common the more similar they are assumed to be. This idea has been used successfully in text classification (Lodhi et al. 2002) and also formed the basis of the author X  X  entry to the second Recognising Textual Entailment Challenge (Clarke 2006).
 convolution: where x , y , z  X  S , f , g  X  1 ( S ).
 Example 18 (Subsequence Matching) e for x  X  A  X  , where e x the function that is 1 on x and 0 elsewhere. In particular e is a unity for the algebra. Define  X  ( a ) = 1 2 ( e a + e ); then A ,
Under this context theory, a sequence x completely entails y if and only if it is a sub-sequence of y . In our experiments, we have shown that this type of context theory can perform significantly better than straightforward lexical overlap (Clarke 2006). Many variations on this idea are possible: for example, using more complex mappings from
A to 1 ( A  X  ).
 Example 19 (Lexical Overlap)
The simplest approach to textual entailment is to measure the degree of lexical over-lap: the proportion of words in the hypothesis sentence that are contained in the text sentence (Dagan, Glickman, and Magnini 2005). This approach can be described as a context theory in terms of a free commutative semigroup on a set A , defined by
A /  X  where x  X  y in A  X  if the symbols making up x can be reordered to make y . Then
More complex definitions of  X  x can be used, for example, to weight different words by their probabilities. 60 4.2 Document Projections
Glickman and Dagan (2005) give a probabilistic definition of entailment in terms of  X  X ossible worlds X  which they use to justify their lexical entailment model based on oc-currences of words in Web documents. They estimate the lexical entailment probability LEP ( u , v )tobe where n v and n u , v denote the number of documents in which the word v occurs and in which the words u and v both occur, respectively. From the context-theoretic perspec-tive, we view the set of documents in which the word occurs as its context vector. To describe this situation in terms of a context theory, consider the vector space where D is the set of documents. With each word u in some set A we associate an operator P u on this vector space by where e d is the basis element associated with document d
P clearly commutative (they are in fact band projections ): P onto the space of documents in which both u and v occur.
 to individual words, as we do, although they interpret these as the probability that a word is  X  X rue X  in a possible world. In their interpretation, a document corresponds to a possible world, and a word is true in that world if it occurs in the document. assumptions about how the entailment probability of a sentence depends on lexical this will only happen if all the words occur in the same document. For any sizeable sentence this is extremely unlikely, hence their alternative approach.
 We define a context theory A , B (  X  ( D )),  X  ,  X  ( D ),  X  p , where:
P
P y p 1 / P x 1 . This corresponds directly to Glickman and Dagan X  X  (2005) entailment  X  X onfidence X ; it is simply the proportion of documents that contain all the terms of x which also contain all the terms of y . 4.3 Latent Dirichlet Projections The formulation in the previous section suggests an alternative approach to that of
Glickman and Dagan (2005) to cope with the data sparseness problem. We consider the finite data available D as a sample from a distributional language D ; the vector p then becomes a probability distribution over the documents in D . In our own experiments, we used latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003) to build a model of the corpus as a probabilistic language based on a subset of around 380,000 documents from the Gigaword corpus. Having this model allows us to consider an infinite array of possible documents, and thus we can use our context-theoretic definition of entailment because there is no problem of data sparseness.
 sis (LSA; Deerwester et al. 1990) and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA;
Hofmann 1999) in that it can be used to build models of corpora in which words within a document are considered to be exchangeable, so that a document is treated as a bag of words. LSA performs a singular value decomposition on the matrix of words and documents which brings out hidden  X  X atent X  similarities in meaning between words, even though they may not occur together.

 tive model, and Figure 4 shows how the model generates a document of length N .In this model, the probability of occurrence of a word w in a document is considered to be a multinomial variable conditioned on a k -dimensional  X  X opic X  variable z . The number of topics k is generally chosen to be much fewer than the number of possible words, so that topics provide a  X  X ottleneck X  through which the latent similarity in meaning between words becomes exposed.
 by a k -dimensional variable  X  , satisfying and which is in turn assumed to follow a Dirichlet distribution. The Dirichlet distribu-tion is itself parameterized by a k -dimensional vector  X  . The components of this vector can be viewed as determining the marginal probabilities of topics, because 62
This is just the expected value of  X  i , which is given by that we can assume are specified in a k  X  V matrix  X  where V is the number of words in the vocabulary. The parameters  X  and  X  can be estimated from a corpus of documents by a variational expectation maximization algorithm, as described by Blei, Ng, and Jordan (2003).
 ing, document classification, and collaborative filtering. They compare LDA to several techniques including PLSA; LDA outperforms these on all of the applications. LDA has been applied to the task of word sense disambiguation (Boyd-Graber, Blei, and Zhu 2007; Cai, Lee, and Teh 2007) with significant success.

 of possible documents, A  X  , so the boundedness property becomes important. P is thus the probability that a document chosen at random contains all the words that parameter  X  : where by a  X  x we mean that the word a occurs in string x ,and p of observing word a in a document generated by the parameter  X  .Weestimatethisby where we have assumed a fixed document length N . This formula is an estimate of the probability of a word occurring at least once in a document of length N ,andthesum over the topic variable z is the probability that the word a occurs at any one point in a document given the parameter  X  . We approximated the integral using Monte Carlo sampling to generate values of  X  according to the Dirichlet distribution. implementation on documents from the British National Corpus, using 100 topics. We evaluated this model on the 800 entailment pairs from the first Recognizing Textual
Entailment Challenge test set. 1 Results were comparable to those obtained by Glickman and Dagan (2005) (see Table 2). In this table, Accuracy is the accuracy on the test set, consisting of 800 entailment pairs, and CWS is the confidence weighted score; see
Dagan, Glickman, and Magnini (2005) for the definition. The differences between the accuracy values in the table are not statistically significant because of the small data set, although all accuracies in the table are significantly better than chance at the 1% level. The accuracy of the model is considerably lower than the state of the art, which is around 75% (Bar-Haim et al. 2006). We experimented with various document lengths and found very long documents ( N = 10 6 and N = 10 7 )toworkbest.
 context algebra must also be commutative, which is clearly far from ideal in modeling natural language. 5. The Model of Clark, Coecke, and Sadrzadeh One of the most sophisticated proposals for a method of composition is that of Clark,
Coecke, and Sadrzadeh (2008) and the more recent implementation of Grefenstette et al. 64 (2011). In this section, we will show how their model can be described as a context theory.

These can be described in terms of partially ordered monoids , a monoid G with a partial ordering  X  satisfying x  X  y implies xz  X  yz and zx  X  zy for all x , y , z Definition 11 (Pregroup)
Let G be a partially ordered monoid. Then G is called a pregroup if for each x are elements x l and x r in G such that and (57).
 grammatical types. Words are then represented as elements formed from these basic types, for example: where  X  , s ,and o are the basic types for first person singular, statement, and object, respectively. It is easy to see that this sentence reduces to type s under the pregroup reductions.
 by endowing the grammatical type of a word with a vector nature, in addition to its semantics. We use this slightly more general construction to allow us to formulate it in the context-theoretic framework. We define an elementary meanin gspace to be the tensor product space V = S  X  P where S is a vector space representing meanings of words and P is a vector space with an orthonormal basis corresponding to the basic grammatical types in a pregroup grammar and their adjoints. We assume that meanings of words live in the tensor algebra space T ( V ), defined by
For an element v in a particular tensor power of V ,suchthat v = ( s  X  X  X  X  ( s matical type for v as the product  X  ( v ) =  X  1  X  2  X  X  X   X  type corresponding to p i . We will call the vectors such as this which have a single complex type (i.e., they are not formed from a weighted sum of more than one type) unambiguous .
 the vector space generated by all such vectors.
 it suffices to define the product between two elements u 1 and whose grammatical type is basic, so that they can be viewed as elements of V .
The definition of the product on the rest of the space follows from the assumption of distributivity. We define two conditions will apply, and both the tensor and inner products are bilinear functions. Moreover, it corresponds to composed and reduced word vectors, as defined in Clark, Coecke, and Sadrzadeh (2008).
 the meanings of the three words, which we write as v word of this example that the word like is represented as a product state composed of three vectors, one for each basic grammatical type. This removes any potentially interesting semantics, but allows us to demonstrate the product in a simple manner. We write this as follows: where e  X  is the orthonormal basis vector corresponding to basic grammatical type  X  . More interesting representations of like would consist of sums over similar vectors.
Computing this product from left to right: 66
As we would expect in this simplified example the product is a scalar multiple of the second vector for like , with the type of a statement.
 to Clark, Coecke, and Sadrzadeh (2008), although it also allows us to take weighted sums of these complex types, giving us a powerful method of expressing syntactic and semantic ambiguity. 6. Conclusions and Future Work
We have presented a context-theoretic framework for natural language semantics. The framework is founded on the idea that meaning in natural language can be determined by context, and is inspired by techniques that make use of statistical properties of language by analyzing large text corpora. Such techniques can generally be viewed as representing language in terms of vectors. These techniques are currently used in appli-cations such as textual entailment recognition, although the lack of a theory of meaning that incorporates these techniques means that they are often used in a somewhat ad hoc manner. The purpose behind the framework is to provide a unified theoretical founda-tion for such techniques so that they may be used in a principled manner. mathematical model that informs us about the nature of meaning under this paradigm.
Specifically, it gives us a theory about how to represent words and phrases using vectors, and tells us that the product of two meanings should be distributive and vector spaces as defining the relation of entailment. It tells us how to measure the size of the vector representation of a string in such a way that the size corresponds to the probability of the string.
 to compositional distributional semantics, including those based on a predefined composition operation such as addition (Landauer and Dumais 1997; Foltz, Kintsch, and Landauer 1998; Mitchell and Lapata 2008) or the tensor product (Smolensky 1990; Clark and Pulman 2007; Widdows 2008), matrix multiplication (Rudolph and Giesbrecht 2010), and the more sophisticated construction of Clark, Coecke, and
Sadrzadeh (2008). 6.1 Practical Investigations ment within the framework.

Although this question is highly dependent on the particular context theory chosen, it is possible that general algorithms for computation within this framework could be found; this is another area that we intend to address in further work. 6.2 Theoretical Investigations
Although the context-theoretic framework is an abstraction of the model of meaning as context, it would be good to have a complete understanding of the model and the types of context theories that it allows. Tying down these properties would allow us to define algebras that could truly be called  X  X ontext theories. X  probability (Voiculescu 1997). It would be interesting to investigate whether ideas from free probability would carry over to context-theoretic semantics.
 we still have to investigate its relationship with other models such as that of Song and Bruza (2003) and Guevara (2011).

Answering this may lead us to new techniques for recognizing and handling multi-word expressions and non-compositionality. presented, because we have given a way of thinking about meaning in natural language that in many respects is new. This new way of thinking opens the door to the unification of logic-based and vector-based methods in computational linguistics, and the potential fruits of this union are many.
