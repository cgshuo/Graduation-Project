 In the last twenty years, large businesses have become more international with design, manufacturing, and production located around the globe. This means that each of these sites needs to be connected for smooth data transactions. To achieve this, a reli-able software system is needed. 
The objective of this study is to understand global design in an enterprise resource planning (ERP) and product data management (PDM) environment. An ERP system provides an all-in-one solution for seamless integration of information flows across an organization [1]; while a PDM system is used for product data management and pub-manufacturing between various global sites [2]. 
The goal of this study is to determine how data flows between different global sites. The main focus of this study is how current PDM and ERP data transfer systems five global machine manufacturing companies with design teams located in Finland. This study is also limited to a PDM and ERP environment. The main target is observ-ing the boundary between PDM and ERP systems in a multinational organization where data is moved between sites on a daily basis. 
The structure of this paper is split into five main chapters. The second chapter will discuss the background of product lifecycle management (PLM) and how PDM and ERP systems are connected. Chapter 3 will discuss master data management and their global PDM systems. Chapter 5 concludes this study. cycle of a product from concept to retiremen t and is deeply associated with computer aided design (CAD) and product data management (PDM) systems. 
PLM is used to spread the influence of PDM systems beyond design and manufac-prise resource planning (ERP) system. The main purpose for linking PDM and ERP systems in a CAD design environment is to ensure the efficient movement of designs through the CAD environment into the PDM system which feeds it to the ERP system and subsequently to manufacturing. To understand product data management it is important to understand PDM systems. According to [5], [2] and [6], PDM is a software framework which enables manufactur-ers to manage engineering information such as the data needed for new product designs entire product lifecycle (PLC) and thus takes a more team-oriented approach to product development. The PDM system helps control how manufacturing data is created, re-viewed, modified, approved and archived. One of the main functions of a PDM system access with a check-in/-out function and controls authorized users [7]. It is also common to use a PDM system to determine the state of an object. A state indicates if an object has been approved to enter the next stage of development [8]. 
A PDM system needs an authoring tool, such as a CAD program, which supplies data to the PDM system [9]. CAD tools are used to design and modify content such as 3D MCAD and ECAD documents. However, a PDM system is not used to handle needed. An ERP system controls the physical ordering and distribution of parts after the design process. By adding an ERP system with a PDM system, they can be made finished product. It is difficult to get a smoothly working integrated PDM/ERP system because they are fundamentally different ways of looking at data management [2]. [9], introduce a framework for PDM/ERP interoperability in which the user has one interface where they can use both systems and [10] introduces a method for digi-tal manufacturing that eases the way data flows between PDM and ERP systems. rate master data from all stakeholders across and beyond the enterprise X  [11]. MDM information in an enterprise. 
With an excellent MDM system, a company will have correct and authoritative master data is information systems (IS), which includes the applications and technol-ogy used to integrate and share data. 
When considering master data implementation it is important to remember that not only is quality and consistency of the data important, but the usage of the data should be available throughout the enterprise. Another advantage of MDM is cost reduction redundant data copies in consolidation and transactional hub styles of MDM [11]. This is due to MDM enabling the reuse of key processes. 
There are three types of MDM implementation styles: (i) consolidation implemen-two are more operationally oriented [14]. 
A consolidation implementation brings master data from multiple existing systems method, typically through batch imports, and can be both queried and updated within the MDM system. A transactional hub implementation is the goal of every MDM system. It is a centralized, complete set of master data for one or more domains. It is a system of record while the other two are systems of reference. Master data in an ideal MDM implementation can be considered a syst em of record while a system of refer-system of record [11]. viewed. These companies are all machine manufacturing companies with design pose of this study all company data is kept anonymous. 4.1 Company A Company A is a medium sized company with 100+ employees with one main site in master copy of the data at the main site up-to-date. This indicates that they are using a consolidation style MDM implementation. 
There has been no need to handle data ownership as most sites have their own de-sites. Technically there is only one database which is at the main-site and when a new then synchronized nightly. Most product design and product maintenance is located at the main site. However, sometimes assemblies will have the same subassemblies. This causes some data management issues, because there is no data locking mechan-isms. This is not seen as a large problem since most of the design work is order engi-neering. 
Approval processes are relaxed since many drawings are created and used only once so if problems do arise the drawings can be redone easily. However, purchased system specific details e.g. naming and grouping. When the approval is complete the data is sent to the main site PDM and ERP systems. There is no process to check for the quality of the data or if the synchronization of data was successful. 
All purchases are done through the ERP system. L ong-term components are pur-chased at an early date in the design cycle, then the main quantity of parts and finally any other parts that are needed. It is not enough to approve an item in the PDM sys-vated separately from the assembly X  X  purchase order located in the ERP system. 
Design tasks are monitored poorly. Designers inform project managers on how a task is progressing, but no clear system exists for monitoring tasks. Design hours are complete a design project is. This is a very difficult process since the design progress also constitutes the timeline for part purchases. 
Figure 1 shows the PDM architecture for company A. Each site has its own PDM needed files and metadata is sent accordingly. 
All sites, including daughter companies, are connected through the ERP and PDM systems so no other data movement is necessary. Designers use a local file database to access information and non-designer users ar e connected to their own systems where they can locate the necessary information. Company A has one data storage location additional synchronization. Synchronization to the central site works well. Moving the data to arrive. Sometimes after a manual data sync, parts of the assembly data will CAD data while assembly data is available through the ERP system. 
Design approval transparency is very poor. The only way to see if something goes wrong with design approval is when it cannot be found in the ERP system. Technical-inflation of messages. Another problem with PDM-ERP transfers is the way certain parameters are handled e.g. groups, types, and units. They need to be manually trans-BOM lines are placed under the same number or something changes on the PDM side which has not transferred correctly. 
PDM-ERP transfers for individual items work really well. Product structures are created automatically for each item and when product specifications e.g. group, unit, are kept in check in the ERP system there are little problems with it. The night repli-cation also works well. 4.2 Company B Company B is a large multinational company with 16,000+ employees. Their head-systems, an internal EDM (Teamcenter) and a global PDM (Aton) which makes things more complex. The higher level PDM system sends data to the global ERP. 
Currently, CAD systems are loosely integrated into the PDM system. Items are approved as prototypes or final products. Final products are sent to the ERP system. When objects are approved in Teamcenter they are sent to Aton. Aton is used for final approvals and items are th e not used for final approval s able in the design process. marginal changes are poss e.g. Aton cannot create ne w and final approval process e monitoring, but the main m

Sometimes, differ add the need for multisite d can access it from the PD M the server scripts. Items th a but other items must be ha n successful. Ownership can only be transferred by an admin. 
Figure 2 shows the PDM architecture for company B. There is one master site and submit information to the main PDM database, Aton. CAD data is moved between the creation level PDM sites, but other PDM information is approved on the PDM level. Aton can then be used to send the PDM information into the global ERP system. This moving toward a transactional hub with a single PDM and ERP system. Teamcenter. There is also no backward data movement from ERP to PDM where some information such as order information, average prices, warehouse inventory could be very useful. that there are two PDM systems interlinked is unnecessary from a user X  X  perspective. other business units only use Aton. 4.3 Company C Company C is a large multinational company with 18,000+ employees and headquar-creates a need for a complex PDM solution which will cater to all divisions with equal Teamcenter. The current global PDM system reflects the coexistence implementation style. 
Company C, like so many others, is trying to move toward a transactional hub, but the need for multisite transfers and creates a faster connection to the central database. 
Figure 3 shows the PDM architecture for company C. The main site and sub-sites are all on the same creation level and feed to a global PDM system. This data can then be moved to the global ERP system. From a PDM-ERP connection perspective there is only one ERP system at Company C. This makes data transfers to ERP simple. There is one PDM to ERP connection located in the EU and another in Asia. 
There is very strict access management built into the PDM system, which increases data protection as a user is allowed to only create, modify, or view materials in their data access management keeps anyone outside the correct user group from tampering. There is also an enterprise content management (ECM) in production which allows all approval is performed the watermark is removed. 
Data is moved in the PDM system and then released to the global ERP. Design ap-provals are monitored by multiple stakeholders, which makes workflows very com-plex. This allows for quality insurance and change management of designs. Items can have two flags: approval and sent to ERP flags. This is useful since long time compo-nents are sent to the ERP before they are approved in the PDM system and are essen-tially placeholders for purchasing. 
Currently no assembly structure skeletons are available. Assembly data is handled through a material master since configurator s are not connected to the PDM system at this time. This causes materials to be released to the ERP system before they are ap-proved in the PDM system. Approvals are not moved between sites; instead they are moved between the PDM and ERP systems. One product approval has a dedicated workflow to send data to the ERP and another is embedded into change management. Many things are done during the approval process including the creation of CAD PDFs and PDXs files. Thus new checkpoints need to be established to keep track of what has been delivered to the ERP system . This causes workflows to become a bot-tleneck when there is an internal failure or when data does not meet the checkpoints of a workflow. problems are solved with a global ERP and by merging sites and transfer speeds suf-fer from latency between sites with site consolidations e.g. Norway to Finland. 4.4 Company D Company D is a multinational company with headquarters in Finland and they have the USA. Company D has design teams in 15-20 countries and it is an inherent feature adds many more countries where small change design work is done. This company is lized PDM-ERP system. This means that Company D is moving from a coexistence platform which enables a global PDM-ERP environment. 
Data ownership is handled poorly. Items can be viewed and edited by different user groups, but with such a large company there are many divisions and outside sources that need to manage the data. Data is not locked unless it is being modified by CAD tools. 
Figure 4 shows the PDM architecture of company D. Data is created at main and formation to transfer. However, this shows designers what information will be availa-ble almost instantaneously. The data can then be moved to the global ERP system. 
Design data is approved in stages and they do not move directly into the ERP sys-tem. There are different workflows for approving items and other workflows which combine the approval and transfer processes. A designer who does research and de-prove their own work to a certain status which allows production. The different status can be used to see if an item is meant for further production or if it is just a one-time assembly. 
Data is moved between sites through a store and forward cache system. Data is tem. The central database then moves the data to the destination site at its own pace. data is saved in the PDM system it is sent to a country cache after which it is moved to the central database. The metadata is moved first which will show up quickly while the actual CAD data will appear when the full transfer is done. 
Currently, most data moves from PDM-ERP, but some aspects are starting to flow from ERP-PDM e.g. sales orders. The most crucial improvement would be to perfor-mance; large data amounts are difficult to move in a short period of time. 4.5 Company E Company E is a large multinational company with headquarters in Zurich, Switzer-land. It employs 150,000+ employees with 16,000 employees in the business unit this currently a large PDM project underway in which many new PDM sites are added and each site has its own PDM and ERP systems which communicate through a mul-tisite collaboration system. 
Assemblies are approved through the PDM system and they are sent to the ERP assembly structure skeleton which is used as a base for the final assembly. Approved items will be flagged, but there is no indicator that it has been sent to ERP. This has caused some problems when drawings or structure data is missing. 
Items are locked when they are in use. This means that nothing can use the item at that time, i.e. another designer or approval process. This ensures quality of data at that item which needs to be used somewhere else. 
Designers are located in multiple locations and can work on the same assemblies or subassemblies. This makes it very important for multisite transfers to work efficiently. each other as most sites are paired up with one or two other sites. 
Figure 5 shows the PDM architecture of company E. Each main site and sub-site is each ERP separately as needed. 
The design process is poorly monitored through Excel spreadsheets and internal communication. Purchases are handled by the ERP system where assembly structure skeletons are run to ensure that long te rm components are delivered on time. 
There have been some issues with multisite transfers. Large assemblies take a long time to transfer and might contain errors. The amount of errors has lessened, but there well and the number of error messages are manageable. 4.6 Data Analysis Since computer systems have become co mmon place in the last two decades, PDM This would make data sharing between sites obsolete and in theory all data would be available for every designer at any time. In practice this is close to impossible to ac-complish with the current technology. Data latency to growing industry centers, such as India and China, is high and will cause problems with connection speeds and syn-Company D has, it is not possible to have 100% accurate data at a central point at all times. 
The interviewed companies were a sampling of a broad range of companies with various needs with one midsized company with 100 employees, four large companies with 10,000-18,000 employees. The differences in the companies X  PDM structures were extensive and reflected the various PDM needs they have. 
The midsized Company A was the only one with a consolidation method solution with no plans to convert in the near future. Their data movement needs are the smal-updated information during a nightly replication process. This eliminates the need for between sites. This makes the main site more important for company A than they are in the other companies where data is moved at a more rigorous pace. hub. Company B X  X  and C X  X  data creation levels are similar, but Company D and Company E create significantly more items than any of the other companies. A trans-actional hub solution is the one every one of these three companies strides for. It has its advantages, but also comes with its own risks as data ownership becomes a serious issue. 
Companies B and C are close in the number of items created in a year. They also have low data movement needs and when a working transactional hub is in place that need will disappear altogether. The methods of data transfer are very different howev-er. Company B is crippled with having to essentially use two PDM software solutions at once, while company C is moving toward a one PDM system solution. 
Company D is the only one with a working transactional hub solution currently in seems to be working efficiently. However, their data ownership processes are poorly handled, unlike in companies B, C and E where data ownership is done efficiently. 
Company E has the largest need for data transfers, but they also have the weakest multisite system. Company E is using a coexistence method which works with a large number of main sites. Many assembly designs are split between sites, which causes a high need to move data through a multisite solution. This data is moved manually and made. This lessens the burden of having to move updated information manually. However, this does not lessen the strain on the system and causes problems with ERP since new data needs to be manually sent to the ERP system. 
Even with such different types of companies they also have their similarities. Four PDM system and SAP as their main ERP system. This can be due to the fact that each company has their main PDM teams in Finland. 4.7 Case Summary A store and cache mechanism, like the one used by company D, is a good method to central database. It moves the metadata instantly to all sites, which allows designers to see what data is available, even if the actual CAD data has not been moved yet. 
Company C has a very strict access management system which monitors data own-ership and authoring. This is a very useful as each designer only sees what data they approval flags; sent to ERP, basic and final approval flags. This is useful, as a design-systems data approvals do not need to move between sites, but are moved inside the PDM and ERP systems themselves. 
Companies A, B and D have stable working environments where the multisite currently undergoing a large PDM project to move away from a multiple PDM system solution to a single PDM system solution. Company E has the most problems with moved compared to the other companies. 
There were some clear similarities between the five companies, such as each of the large companies had chosen to use Teamcenter as their main PDM software and SAP for their main ERP software. This could be due to the fact that all were large machine manufacturing companies where the main PDM site was located in Finland and so the study is quite limited to their point-of-view. Data management is an important part of a company X  X  business structure as it controls management and enterprise resource planning systems. In this environment, design data moves between the PDM and ERP systems within one site and between sites through a multisite connection. 
Five different companies were interviewed to see how different companies handle best method to gain a working solution was to nullify the need for a multisite system signs simpler and more efficient. The downside of this system is the long distance and current infrastructure in places such as China and India which causes bad data latency issues. 
There were some clear similarities between the five interviewed companies, such as each large company had chosen to use Teamcenter as their main PDM software and SAP for their main ERP software. This could be due to the fact that all were large machine manufacturing companies where the ma in PDM site was located in Finland. This could have skewed the results to favor a similar view. 
Global design is a very important research subject which will only expand as more become more popular.
