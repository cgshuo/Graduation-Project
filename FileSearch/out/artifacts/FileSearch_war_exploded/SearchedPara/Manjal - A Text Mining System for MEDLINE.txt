Text mining can be described as the extraction of novel information from text sources. By novel we mean that the extracted information is not explicitly present in the text being analyzed. Text mining systems are generally used to generate hypotheses that are then verified by domain ex-perts. An example of this approach would be to find all novel relationships between a disease and a drug. This ap-proach is useful given the vast amount of information avail-able today. Systems based on this approach, such as AR-ROWSMITH 1 have been successfully used to discover novel hypotheses that have later been verified.

In this demonstration we describe Manjal 2 , a text mining system designed to help individuals explore one or more top-ics using the MEDLINE database. MEDLINE is an index to biomedical research that is maintained by the National Li-brary of Medicine (NLM). Typically each MEDLINE record has a title, an abstract, descriptive phrases called MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms and several other fields. Manjal accesses MEDLINE automatically through NLM X  X  web-based interface, PubMed.

Manjal considers a topic as its unit of analysis. A topic is defined as a MEDLINE query that is supported by the http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/ http://sulu.info-science.uiowa.edu/Manjal.html PubMed interface. An example topic would be  X  X yperten-sion OR high blood pressure X . We describe a topic using the notion of a  X  X opic profile X , which is the set of mesh metadata terms, from MEDLINE, associated with a topic. Each term in a profile is assigned some weight highlighting its impor-tance in describing the topic. The terms in profiles can be restricted using MEDLINE semantic types. The strength of a relationship between two topics is judged by the similarity between their respective profiles. Manjal X  X  text mining func-tions allow a user to explore one or more topics as follows: 1. With one input topic Manjal may be used to explore its term features (topic profile) or identify indirectly related terms (i.e., novel topics) 2. With two input topics Manjal may be used to deter-mine if there are novel connections between them. 3. With a larger group, i.e. a dataset of topics, Manjal may be used to identify group characteristics as well as iden-tify pairs that are potentially connected in novel ways.
Identifying indirectly related terms and identifying novel connections between a pair of topics resemble the  X  X pen X  and  X  X losed X  discovery approaches [1], respectively.
Manjal is implemented as a web-based system that allows users to create individual accounts and stores the history of topics already processed by a user, for re-analysis at a later time. Manjal uses graphviz 3 to dynamically gener-ate interactive graphs where nodes represent topics and the links between them show the strength of their relationship. Clicking on a link displays the terms that connect the two topics. We have used Manjal to postulate a beneficial role for turmeric in retinal diseases [2].
