 The ACM TALIP Special Issues on NTCIR-4 1 contain fourteen pape rs selected from the papers submitted by researchers involved in the Fourth NTCIR Workshop (NTCIR-4) . research in information access technologies su ch as information retrieval (IR), question answering, summarization, text mining, and so on, by providing large-scale evaluation infrastructures and a forum for researchers inte rested in cross-system comparisons and in exchanging research ideas in an inform al atmosphere. Because fundamental text processing, such as indexing, includes language-dependent procedures, the NTCIR project began in late 1997, and has placed emphasis on East Asian languages such as Japanese, Chinese, Korean, (and English documents published in Asia), and its series of workshops has attracted international participation. initial document release to the final meeting as the workshop . Each workshop selects task may consist of more than one subtask. directions: For testing IR systems, we placed emphasi s on East Asian languages and on testing various document genres. For the challenging issues, we looked at the technologies that processing; and at the methodologies and metrics that provide more realistic and reliable evaluations, with special attention to users X  information-seeking tasks. Patent Retrieval (PATENT); Question Answ ering (QAC); Text Summarization (TSC); and the Web (WEB). 2 Seventy-four groups from twelve different countries and areas participated and submitted results. Eighty pape rs were presented at the NTCIR-4 Meeting in June 2004. Among these eighty papers, forty-one applied for recommendation for the special issue on NTCIR-4. From the fort y-one papers, the Recommendation Committee selected twenty-three to extend submission to the special issue. Of these twenty-three papers, twenty-one were submitted to the special issue. Each submitted paper was reviewed by three or more referees following the standard review procedures of ACM-TALIP. Fourteen of these papers were selected for publication. ABOUT THE PAPERS The first of the two special issues, TALIP Vol. 4, No. 2, contains seven papers on cross-lingual information retrieval and on retrieval from different document genres. Post-translation Query Expansion in Chinese-English Cross-lingual Information Retrieval X  addresses the translation of ou t-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms using WEB, and disambiguation using a hidden Markov model in Chinese-English CLIR. Unlike English and other European languages, which use identical or similar sets of alphabets and cognate matching works for proper nouns, named entities in East Asian languages are problems for CLIR, where each language uses its own alphabet, making the translation and disambiguation of OOV, including the entities, critical. Information Retrieval: Lessons Learned from NTCIR-4 X  give a detailed analysis of the effectiveness and contribution of each of the modules, including pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), multiword term down-weighting, and term weight merging strategies in their own retrieval systems, CLARIT and ConceptBase, for Japanese, English, and bilingual CLIR on multiple levels of releva nce judgments. The authors demonstrate that PRF is the main performance enhancer. Feedback via Selective Sampling X  proposes a novel PRF method. It is known that PRF is performance of the proposed method across 60 topics was comparable to traditional PRF, the proposed method behaved differently when the results were analyzed topic-by-topic. This method is regarded as an initial step in addressing the problem of PRF with reasonable computational cost. Cross-Lingual Retrieval of Korean Texts Using Chinese and English, X  Kwok , Choi, and Dinstl address Korean monolingual IR, Chinese-Korean bilingual with English as a pivot language, and Chinese-English bilingual CLIR. This is the first challenge for the authors X  own PIRCS model to be tested on the Korean language. They thoroughly investigated the effectiveness of various strategies, including indexing, stemming, translating OOV using the Web, and disambiguation using log-likelihood. It shows the importance of the named entity/terminology translation, especially at the pivot language. Models for Use with Asian Languages, X  addr esses multilingual CLIR on Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and English. It demonstrates that his approach for multiple European-language CLIR, in which an effective monolingual inde xing and search system, a combined query languages. large-scale patent document collection via the authors X  proposed approaches that consider the claim structures of the patents and the re-ranking and refinement of two-stage retrieval. Japanese Newspaper and Patent Retrieval, X  Fujita continues his long-standing interest on the effects of document length on retrieva l performance and PRF via a comparative study of Okapi BM25 and KL-divergence language model on two collections of completely different document genres, newspapers and patents. access to the information in documents as well as to the documents themselves. The question answering and the next two address automated multidocument summarization. The last two articles address the expansion and modification of queries. Question Answering Technologies Useful for Information Access Dialogues?  X  An Empirical Study and a Proposal of a Novel Challenge X  addresses question answering in information access dialogues. The authors carefully examine what types of abilities are necessary to answer questions in such dialo gues. Based on their examination, the authors propose a very interesting challenge, termed Question Answering Challenge for Information Access Dialogue (QACIAD) as the subtask 3 of the NTCIR-4 QAC. In QACIAD, participating QA systems are required to answer a series of related questions. They also report valuable experience in the QAC subtask 3 in NTCIR-4. Answering System, X  describes a high-perfor mance Japanese question answering system. It achieves its best performance in the subtask 1 of the NTCIR-4 QAC, i.e., MRR=0.607. Although this success may be ow ed to the combination of se veral effective modules, the The answer type analysis was a hybrid of a named entity recognizer based on machine learning and a set of hand-craf ted rules. The named entity recognizer achieved very high precision, but only gave a coarse-grained classi fication. The author therefore used this as an answer candidate generator and combines it with hand-crafted rules to eliminate inappropriate candidates. With regards to document retrieval, the author proposes a new proximity-based document ranking method, termed Decayed IDF (DIDF), and reports that this method is better than BM25 and MultiText. and Its Improvement X  reports on the improvement in a Japanese question answering system in terms of its accuracy. His group is developing a real-time Japanese question answering system that is controlled by A* search to reduce the turn-around time, while maintaining the accuracy of th e answers. The main advantag e of this system is that preprocessing does not need to be performed on a document database, and we may use version of this system, i.e., MRR=0.3, was not sufficiently high. Therefore, in this article, the author proposes several measures in the degree of sentence matching and a variant of the voting method, and reports that the new system achieved a higher MRR of 0.5. Question-Answering Engine, X  Mori , Nozawa , and Asada address multiple document summarization that is driven by multiple questions. The authors propose a method to calculate the importance of sentences by us ing the question answering scores of words that are generated by a question answering engine and integrate the scores into a sentence importance ranking produced by a generic multi-document summarization system. The authors also report that their method is not only better than baseline, but also better than the systems of the other participants at NTCIR-4 TSC. of Sentences Extracted from Multiple Newspaper Articles X  proposes a novel approach for finding a cohesive order of extracted sentences for summarizing multiple documents. The heart of the approach is the refinement in the order of the extracted sentences, which are initially arranged according to the chronological order of the documents. The refinement is performed by maintaining the precedence relation between sentences. Although the precedence relation was originally defined among the sentences in one document, the authors presume that a sentence in one document that is similar to a sentence in another document should hold the relation. The auth ors report that their method successfully raises the acceptability of sent ence-ordering in summaries. Boolean IR Models for WWW Document Retrieval X  propose a method to modify a given query expressed with Boolean operators by using information from the relevant documents and test the method on Web documents. Based on Terms and Relevant Terms X  describes the authors X  approach to Chinese monolingual retrieval, which outperformed in the NTCIR-4 CLIR Chinese subtask. The authors show that among the three major modules in their approach, extended query expansion using both top-ranked retrieved target documents and the WEB, and document re-ranking using long query terms contributed significantly to improving search effectiveness. of information access technologies and their various related areas.
