 partial supervision presented in Chapter 5 helps navigate the search for structure when some (usually quite small) fraction of data has been labeled (hence the name of partial supervision).

Next (in Chapter 6), the author moves on to a more general discussion by developing fundamental prin-ciples of knowledge-based guidance and offers some taxonomy of the domain knowledge hints. The concept of proximity based clustering is of particular significance. Using this concept, domain knowledge becomes available through collection of a series of proximity values between the selected pairs of data. In our digital photo album example, it is quite intuitive to anticipate that the user navigates or personalizes the search by comparing some pairs of pictures and expressing their proximity (level of resemblance).

Chapter 7 introduces the interesting and useful idea of collaborative clustering in which clustering is han-dled within several sources of data when they communicate (collaborate) at the level of information gran-ules (partition matrices or prototypes). Directional clustering (Chapter 8) addresses the issue of data organization while looking at the directionality of the mappings between the data spaces. Next, in Chapter 9 fuzzy relational clustering is discussed.

A significant portion of the book is devoted to the granular description of data and this involves hyper-box models and the Tschebyschev variant of the Fuzzy C-Means as well as genetic tolerance fuzzy neural networks (in which knowledge-based clustering is augmented by the use of fuzzy neurocomputing). The two concluding chapters look into granular modeling by showing how the results of clustering can be directly applied to system modeling in the form of so called granular mappings and linguistic modeling.
Summarizing, the book is an important milestone in the development of human-centric oriented data analysis that offers a unique, outstanding vision and at the same time a highly readable and authoritative treatment of knowledge-based clustering. Through this work Dr. Pedrycz has proven his unique mastery in combining insightful vision with fundamental science into an outstanding perspective on one of the major technologies destined to fuel tomorrow  X  s e-Society.

Mark T. Maybury (Ed.), New Directions in Question Answering, AAAI Press/The MIT Press, 2004, ISBN: 0-262-63304-3, $40
Mark Maybury has accustomed us to a high quality series of books. I just mention at least other two of his books that I found really valuable (i.e. Intelligent Multimedia Information Retrieval ,and Intelligent
Multimedia Interfaces ). The topic of the present book is Question Answering (QA), taking into account new research directions, and giving also some insights about commercial systems.

Since the first investigations of artificial intelligence, researchers have always worked to the problem of conversing with a machine in natural language to get answers to questions. One could also observe that having responses to queries has always been the aspiration of the human beings, and not mentioning the Socrates methodology to find the Truth through a question-answering process with his scholars. Question answering is a particularly challenging topic because it needs the advancements of several fields.
These include Natural Language Processing (NLP) (e.g. document understanding, information extraction, language generation, question analysis), information retrieval (e.g. document analysis, query formulation, relevance feedback), and human computer interaction (e.g. user modeling, user preferences, interface design). Given this multidisciplinary position, it is easy to realize how difficult it is to build QA systems. The first attempts to develop a QA system date back to the 1960s, with Green  X  sB Woods  X  L UNAR (1972) systems. They respectively provided answers to queries about American Baseball
League and about lunar samples from the Apollo missions. Today QA is a research area so strategic that the US government  X  s Text Retrieval and Evaluation Conference (TREC) has a QA track, organized as a competition-based system evaluation with dozens of participants. Since the first works during the 1960s, obviously there have been many developments. One important difference that is worthwhile mentioning is that we moved from a closed and limited world knowledge repository to the open, dynamic and poten-tially unlimited Web environment.

A QA system typically addresses some types of questions, process a range of sources (e.g. Web pages, doc-uments, textual databases) in order to produce answers for users. So, the classical architecture of a QA sys-tem involves components for question analysis, document retrieval, answer extraction, and presentation.
One important notion in QA systems is that of factoid questions (or fact-finding questions) vs. analytical questions. A factoid question looks for pieces of information that would make a corresponding statement true (i.e. they are  X  X  X acts X  X ):  X  X  X ow many citizens live in Paris? X  X  X  X  X  X  X here are X citizens in Paris X  X  or  X  X  X here is
Mount Olympus? X  X  X  X  X  X  X he Mount Olympus is in Greece X  X . Thus a factoid question normally has one correct answer that is the true answer. On the other hand the  X  X  X ruth X  X  of an analytical question is often a matter of opinion and/or may depend on the context in which the query is asked. This implies that a  X  X  X rue X  X  answer may have no value or could not even be found. Instead answers to analytical questions should be judged as helpful, satisfactory, useful, etc. While the factoid questions have a distinctive answer type (e.g.  X  X  X ho is the mayor of San Francisco? X  X  expects a particular  X  X  X erson X  X  as an answer) and this induces a strategy in finding the answers, for the analytic questions the problems are more complex. In fact, analytic questions have an unlimited variety of syntactic forms, and in any case there is a loose connection between their syntax and the expected answers. In this case, the answer formulation should be guided for example by the topics the user is interested in, or other user characteristics (e.g. emotions, attitudes, and so on).

For this reason, modern QA should be a multidisciplinary field and the book gives clear perspective about these issues. This is in my opinion the strong point of this book. The topics addressed in the book are not limited to various natural language processing techniques, and we find chapters about temporal and event representation, answer-focused summarization, finding answer to complex questions (e.g.,  X  X  X o weld-ing sites yield any structural weakness that could be threat for failure? X  X ). The book covers also multimedia question answering (e.g., answering questions about moving objects). In certain domains, it is possible to directly extract the semantic content of videos and provide rich question answering capabilities. In my opin-ion, a NLP system integrated with multimedia/multimodal capabilities is a very interesting paradigm to ex-plore, and a very effective way to communicate with a computer exploiting a larger bandwidth than natural language only modalities.

Another fascinating topic is opinion-oriented QA. Opinionoid questions include queries such as:  X  X  X hat is the general opinion from the German press toward the recent Pope election? X  X  or  X  X  X hat was the word-wide reaction to the 2002 annual US report on human rights? X  X . Some research approaches this problem as an opinion-oriented information extraction to create summary representations of opinions, expressing positive or negative attitudes towards people organization or things. There is an interesting chapter in the book about this issue. Apart from a research point of view, it is not difficult to imagine how valuable and crucial is this topic also for commercial systems (i.e. market analysis, opinions about products, etc.).
The book is organized in a systematic way into seven sections, and each section has a collection of three to four papers. The foundations section addresses the architectural foundations and the commercial history of question answering. I have found particularly interesting the chapter about bringing commercial ques-tion answering to the Web. The chapter reports a 2003 survey of 57 leading e-commerce sites handled com-mon question users using three test simple queries (e.g.  X  X  X ow do I contact custom service? X  X ). I will not reveal the results of this evaluation, but let me say that I was a bit surprised.

The second section is about definitions, terminology and biography. It focuses on systems that deal with answering new classes of questions such as definitions, terminology definitions, and automatic generation of biographies from web documents. The third section addresses questions dealing with opinions, time and multi-ple media. Then there is a part about dialogue and interactivity, an important new direction in QA is the capa-bility to exploit context in interactive sessions, clarifying and refining questions to interpret complex questions.
The fifth section addresses the reuse of answers to previous asked questions. Then there is an interesting section about new methodologies for question processing and answering: for example responding to ques-tions about relationship of two terms (e.g.  X  X  X hat do Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova and US astronaut Sally Ride have in common? X  X ) by expanding the query with terms that connect the two, exploit-ing some graphical models. Another example could be the techniques on the basis of START QA system. The idea is to use some Web sources (e.g. World Factbook o countries, Biography.com, and Internet Movie Database) to populate a database, and then the NLP modules exploit this database for question answering.
The last section of the book is about knowledge and inference, which are essential to answering complex questions, inferring answers, providing explanations and justifications (e.g. deductive question answering from multiple sources, or use of advance reasoning for detecting and explaining user misconceptions and for providing cooperative responses to questions that are not answerable or possibly ill formed).
In my opinion two things are missing in this book. The first one is a minor thing. I would like to have a separate chapter devoted only on the evaluation issues, and competition descriptions (i.e. information about TREC is surely present, but it is scattered all over the book). The rationale of the competitions in some sense gives the directions of the research on the field and such a chapter would help the beginners approaching this field.

The second missing point is more substantial. The book should have a chapter about multilingual ques-tion answering. Multilinguality has always been out of the scope of the TREC QA evaluation exercises, which up to now, have focused on systems for English. However within the framework of the Cross Lan-guage Evaluation Forum (CLEF), a track for non-English monolingual and cross-language QA systems was successfully carried out since 2003. The target document collection for the CLEF 2005 monolingual and bilingual tasks will be in the following languages: Bulgarian , Dutch , English , Finnish , French , German , Italian , Portuguese and Spanish .

In conclusion, this is an exiting book, rich with many ideas. I do not hesitate to suggest it not only to anyone interesting in question answering but also to whoever wants to have some insights on the potenti-ality of natural language process, possibly imagining new research directions in front of the QA roadmap that the editor presents in the introduction.
