 We demonstrate the merits of using document clusters that are created offline to improve the overall effectiveness and performance robustness of a state-of-the-art pseudo-feedback-based query expansion method  X  the relevance model .
Pseudo-feedback-based (PF) query expansion methods aug-ment the query with terms from documents in an initially retrieved list. The list is often composed of documents most highly ranked by using document-query similarities [9, 6]. However, some (or even many) of the documents in the ini-tial list may not be relevant. Furthermore, not all query-related aspects might be manifested in the list [3]. Hence, the expanded query might exhibit query drift [9], that is, represent an information need different than that underly-ing the original query. Indeed, there are many queries for which state-of-the-art PF expansion methods yield retrieval performance that is substantially inferior to that of using the original query with no expansion  X  the performance robustness problem [2, 7].

The potentially degraded  X  X uality X  of the initial list is of-ten caused by the virtue of the way it is created, that is, us-ing surface-level document-query similarities. Thus, we pro-pose to perform query-expansion based on clusters of similar documents that are created offline. These clusters, which will be selected based on their query-similarities, can poten-tially be considered as better reflecting the corpus-context of the query than individual documents are [4, 5, 8]. A case in point, the clusters can contain relevant documents that do not exhibit high surface-level query similarity, but which are similar to documents that do.

We show that utilizing clusters created offline can improve the overall effectiveness and performance robustness of a state-of-the-art PF-based query expansion method  X  the relevance model [6]. The performance also transcends that of a recently-proposed approach that utilizes query-specific clusters to enhance the relevance model performance [7]. for LM induction. Topic titles served as queries. Unless otherwise specified, we use Dirichlet-smoothed unigram lan-guage models with the smoothing parameter set to 1000.
We use MAP and p@5 for performance evaluation mea-sures. Statistically-significant differences of performance are determined using the two-sided Wilcoxon test at a 95% con-fidence level. We also report the performance robustness of the methods (denoted  X % &gt;  X ); that is, the percentage of queries for which a method posts performance (MAP/p@5) that is superior to that of the LM query-likelihood model [10] (denoted LM ) that does not perform query expansion.
We use relevance model number3(RM3),whichisastate-of-the-art pseudo-feedback-based query-expansion method [6, 1], for experiments. We set the Jelinek-Mercer smoothing parameter of the LMs from which RM3 is constructed to 0 . 9 following previous recommendations [6]. The other free pa-rameters of RM3 are set in the tested methods to values that optimize MAP. Specifically, the number of elements, k ,used for RM3 construction is chosen from { 10 , 50 , 100 , 500 } ;the number of terms is set to values in { 25 , 50 , 100 , 500 ,ALL } , where  X  ALL  X  stands for the number of unique terms in the corpus; and, the parameter that governs the interpolation
Following previous work on cluster-based retrieval we use (overlapping) nearest-neighbors clusters of 5 documents that are created prior to retrieval time [4, 5, 11]. A cluster is rep-resented by the concatenation of its constituent documents. The order of concatenation has no effect since we use uni-gram language models that assume term independence.
As a reference comparison we use a recently-proposed cluster-based sampling method (denoted SamplingQE )for constructing RM3 [7]. Specifically, we take the 50 docu-ments in the corpus that yield the highest query-likelihood and cluster them into 50 query-specific (overlapping) nearest-neighbors clusters of 5 documents. Then, we use the con-stituent documents (with repetitions) of the m query-specific clusters that yield the highest query-likelihood to construct RM3. The free parameters X  values are set to optimize MAP; specifically, m is set to values in { 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 } ,and the other free parameters are set to values in the ranges specified above.

As can be seen in Table 1 all query-expansion-based meth-ods post in most cases better performance than that of the non-expansion-based LM approach. We can also see that our proposed methods, ClustQE and DocClustQE, post per-formance that is in a majority of the relevant comparisons (corpus  X  evaluation measure) superior to, and more robust than, that of the DocQE and SamplingQE 1 methods.
