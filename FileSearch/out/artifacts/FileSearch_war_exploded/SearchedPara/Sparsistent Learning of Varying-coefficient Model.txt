The graph structure estimation using the TDB-Lasso is demonstrated on a real dataset of elec-troencephalogram (EEG) measurements. We use the brain computer interface (BCI) dataset IVa from [11] in which the EEG data is collected from 5 subjects, who were given visual cues based on which they were required to imagine right hand or right foot for 3.5s. The measurement was per-formed when the visual cues were presented on the classes are given in Appendix due to the space limit.
