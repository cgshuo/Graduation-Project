 Common strategies to liberate an organization X  X  information assets for situational awareness frequently rely on infrastructure components such as data integration, enterprise search, federation, data ware housing, and so on. And while these traditional platforms enable analysts to get better and faster answers to their queries, the next big advance will change this paradigm. Users cannot be expected to formulate and ask every smart question ev ery day. And to escape this impractical and un-scalable model, the new paradigm will involve technologies where  X  X he data finds the data X  and  X  X elevance finds the user. X  Pe rpetual Analytics describes a class of application whereby ente rprise context is assembled, in real-time, on data streams as fast as operational systems record observations. Context construction is a  X  X ata finds the data X  activity which enables events of interest to be streamed to subscribers. In this talk, I will talk at some depth about the dynamics of such systems including scalability and sustainability.

In these capacities, he is responsible for shaping the overall technical strategy of next generation identity analytics and the use of this new capability in the ove rall IBM technology strategy. The IBM Entity Analytic Solu tions group was formed based on technologies developed by Mr. Jonas as the founder and chief scientist of Systems Research &amp; Development (SRD). SRD was acquired by IBM in January 2005. Today, Mr. Jonas applies his real world and hands on experience in software design and development to drive technology innovations while delivering higher levels of privacy and civil liberties protections. By way of example, the most recent breakthrough developed by Mr. Jonas involves an innovative technique enabling advanced data correlation while only using irreversible cryptographic hashes. This new capability makes it possible for organizations to discover records of common interest (e.g., identities) without the transfer of any privacy invading content. This privacy-enhancing technology known as anonymous entity resolution delivers extraordinary new levels of privacy protection while enabling technology to contribute to critical societal interests like clinical health care res earch, aviation safety, homeland innovations have recei ved coverage in such publications as The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Fortune, and Computerworld and have been featured on ABC Primetime with Peter Jennings, The Discovery Channel, The Learning Channel and MSNBC. Known for his dynamic presentational style, he is a popular speaker on technology, security and privacy and has spoken at events such as the Federal Convention on Emerging Technologies Forum on Homeland Security, National Security Agency X  X  INFOSEC Seminar Series, American Society for Industrial Security, Black Hat, PC Forum, Wharton Technology Conference, National Retail Federation Annual Fraud Conference and Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference. Mr. Jonas is a member of the Markle Foundation Task Force on National Security in the Information Age and actively contributes his insights on privacy, technology and homeland security to leading national think tanks, privacy advocacy groups, and policy research organizations, including the Center for Democracy and Technology, Heritage Foundation and the Office of the Secretary of Defense Highlands Forum. Most recently Mr. Jonas has been named a senior advisor to Center for S trategic and In terna ti onal Studies .
