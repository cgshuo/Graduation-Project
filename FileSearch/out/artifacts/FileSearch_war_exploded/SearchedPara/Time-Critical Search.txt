 We study time-critical search, where users have urgent in-formation needs in the context of an acute problem. As ex-amples, users may need to know how to stem a severe bleed, help a baby who is choking on a foreign object, or respond to an epileptic seizure. While time-critical situations and actions have been studied in the realm of decision-support systems, little has been done with time-critical search and re-trieval, and little direct support is offered by search systems. Critical challenges with time-critical search include accu-rately inferring when users have urgent needs and provid-ing relevant information that can be understood and acted upon quickly. We leverage surveys and search log data from a large mobile search provider to (a) characterize the use of search engines for time-critical situations, and (b) de-velop predictive models to accurately predict urgent infor-mation needs, given a query and a diverse set of features spanning topical, temporal, behavioral, and geospatial at-tributes. The methods and findings highlight opportunities for extending search and retrieval to consider the urgency of queries.
Web search may be performed in the context of press-ing, time-critical challenges where information is needed ur-gently. For example, acute medical concerns, such as faint-ing, seizures, bleeding, heart attack, broken bones, numb-ness, vertigo, and pain may lead to the urgent pursuit of medical information in support of timely action. In time-critical situations, the value of retrieved information dimin-ishes with delays in action informed by the information [27]. Urgency of action has largely been ignored in information retrieval (IR). If search systems could estimate the urgency of searchers X  information needs at query time, they could fa-vor content that assists searchers in performing urgent tasks such as making assessments of situations, engaging appropri- X  Cu rrently at Google.
 ate assistance, and performing supportive procedures. Sur-facing content that is relevant and understandable in time-critical settings could help people with taking timely action in acute situations, where delays can be costly and even life-threatening.

As we will show, people frequently turn to search en-gines for assistance with urgent medical matters. Search engines might better help people to perform life-saving pro-cedures while they are waiting for emergency medical ser-vices (EMS), especially in remote areas. Also, search en-gines could help people to understand the urgency of situa-tions. EMS has been found to be underutilized because of uncertainty about the relevance of symptoms [23], economic disadvantage [50], and reliance on self-treatment [9]. As an example, in the case of severe chest pain, only 50% of people engage EMS [10]. By some reports, mortality from heart at-tacks can be decreased by 25% if therapy is initiated within one hour of the onset of acute symptoms [9]. Offering solu-tions to such challenges could raise the likelihood of valuable actions being rendered in advance of the arrival of EMS [38].
Time criticality has been studied outside of IR, and re-searchers have examined time X  X tility tradeoffs in settings such as trauma care [28], emergency medicine [27, 35], com-munications [26] and aerospace [25]. Research on various temporal aspects of IR has focused on longitudinal analy-ses of information needs [48, 11], including predicting future events [45], ranking [46], and query auto-completion [49]. Recent work in search evaluation has focused on the inclu-sion of information gained over time in determining retrieval system performance [31, 51]. However, to our knowledge none of this research has explicitly considered the urgency of situations in the process search and retrieval.
To our knowledge, we provide the first detailed study of time-critical information needs and urgency in search. We focus on the retrieval of time-critical health informa-tion needs because Web search is often used to search for health information [20] and a portion of health searches are urgent in nature, performed to address concerns and chal-lenges arising in real time. We employ both a survey and a large-scale analysis of mobile search behavior to understand the nature of such urgent medical needs in retrieval settings, characterize their occurrence, and develop models to predict urgent needs given a query.

Before continuing, we present an example of a time-critical health search situation drawn from the logs of the Microsoft Bing search engine, used in our study (Figure 1). In the example, the searcher is observed issuing queries about di-agnosing a potential stroke. A subsequent search for an emergency room suggests that the searcher believes that the situation is urgent.

Behavioral evidence such as that in Figure 1 has been used to model search interests and intentions, especially when including result click information [32, 1]. Using such ev-idence, combined with geographical, topical, and temporal features, we develop classifiers to predict urgent information needs. Estimating the degree of urgency associated with a search request is a necessary first step for developing search systems to support time-critical information seeking. Stud-ies have shown that results returned by search systems for urgent health scenarios are irrelevant, inaccurate, and do not consider the influence of cognitive load on people fac-ing emergency situations [43, 25]. Given an estimate of ur-gency, search systems could favor particular types of content (e.g., instructional pages containing clear guidelines) or dis-play instant answers comprising graphics or videos to guide people in taking action quickly. Results that are most ap-propriate for urgent situations might not be ideal for more relaxed settings. For example, the best material for review-ing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in preparation for a course on advanced cardiac life support is quite differ-ent than the best content to display to frenetic users trying to understand what to do when an elderly relative is sud-denly unresponsive and no heartbeat and breathing can be detected.

We shall next report on a survey performed by crowdwork-ers on recent handling of emergencies and the experience with using search to support decisions during such emergen-cies. Then we describe the construction and validation of a machine-learned classifier that can predict time criticality, focusing on the definition of sets of predictive features and the curation of the data set, employing an automated label-ing procedure. Using nearly half a million sessions over six months of mobile search activity, we build a classifier with 88% positive precision and positive recall.
Areas of relevant related work include studies in (a) user behavioral modeling, (b) time-aware information access, and (c) models of time-criticality, including efforts in artificial intelligence. We consider each of these areas in turn.
There has been significant research on analysis of search behavior. Search log data has been used to study how peo-ple engage in search activity [55], predict users X  next online actions, including the timing of next actions and the in-fluence of timing on query content [37, 15], predict users X  future interests [17], and to improve the operation of search engines [32, 1]. The influence of the search situation on in-formation needs and activities has been examined in detail in research on incorporation of notions of broader context in search [29]. Focusing on individual users, modeling short-and long-term searcher interests can also be useful for ap-plications such as search personalization [7, 52].
Contextual signals such as location [5] and search task [40] can be used to more completely model searcher X  X  situations at query time. Research on mobile information seeking has characterized usage patterns [34] or developed support for mobile search [41]. However, these methods employ user location in ranking (preferring proximal resources), rather than using this information in a richer model of search in-tentions as we do in this research. Just-in-time information retrieval agents [47] proactively retrieve information based on user context and alert people to urgent information. We focus on people seeking to satisfy urgent information needs rather than on identifying valuable recommendations.
Studying longitudinal trends in online search behavior within and between users can be useful for understanding the in-world activities of searchers [48, 11], with applications in health care [22, 57]. A recent study explored perceived time pressure on search satisfaction, and search behavior in controlled settings [14]. Time is also emerging as an impor-tant aspect of retrieval evaluation, with methods focused on the extent of the information gained over the course of the search session [31, 51].

Time-dependent actions and outcomes have been stud-ied in the artificial intelligence (AI) community, including efforts with representation and reasoning, and applications in automated and human decision making. Studies in the latter domain have focused on the development of methods for the real-time control of the configuration and quantity of information on displays [25], methods for triaging com-munications [26], and methods for representing and reason-ing about time-dependent utilities of action, with applica-tions that include providing decision support for emergency medicine [27] and trauma care [28]. Beyond applications, the work has explored key principles of time-critical deci-sions in light of computational and cognitive constraints, e.g., [24]. Such careful exploration of the tradeoffs between time and utility could enable search engines to consider de-grees of urgency and information value. Human factors re-searchers have studied how people use information in such time-sensitive work settings as emergency response [35]. Psy-chologists have also examined the influence of urgency on human behavior [36] and work task performance [8].
Some limited support is available in search engines for par-ticular high-stakes queries (e.g., searches for poison or sui-cide being linked to hotline telephone numbers [13]). Rather than such sparse special-case linkages, we construct predic-tive models that estimate the urgency of queries via analysis of query behavior and situational features.
A review of logs of searches performed in mobile settings obtained from consenting users of the Microsoft Bing search engine reveals a surprisingly large number of queries that could be time critical. However, we cannot confirm urgency in the absence of ground truth. To better understand ur-gency in search settings, we conducted an initial survey. The goal was to estimate the frequency with which peo-ple turned to search engines when faced with time-critical needs, the general circumstances of the situations, and to understand how the degree of urgency influenced the use of search engines.
Search Respon-de nts
For the survey, we employed Amazon X  X  Mechanical Turk (A MT) to recruit a set of crowdworkers drawn from the U.S. population. Two surveys were conducted. The first was aimed at understanding general characteristics of how users behave in an emergency. The second survey focused specifically on the use of search in emergencies. The sample comprised of AMT Masters, workers who have completed at least 1000 hits with an approval rating &gt; 95%. The sur-veys had 133 (120) respondents. The distribution of gender was 50% F, 50% M in the first survey and 46% F, 54% M in the second. In both surveys, we only considered par-ticipants who had recalled being in an emergency situation within the past year, so as to ensure that details of the sit-uation were easier to remember. Several biases have been noted in the general AMT population demographics (e.g., younger, female, seeking auxiliary income [44]), and these biases should be considered when interpreting the results.
The results indicate that 12% of users turn to a Web search engine in an emergency. Among those with a smart-phone, 16% turned to search for additional assistance. Time-critical sessions constitute a small fraction of all search traf-fic. However, the high stakes of action in time-critical situ-ations motivate efforts to detect and respond to urgency.
One goal of the survey was to understand the types of urgent problems experienced among all users vs. those who used a search engine. To gain insights about the distribu-tion of urgent problems , we asked participants to categorize their time-critical needs using a classification available from the Medical Priority Dispatch System [12], a U.S. national standard for 911 response coding. The distribution of prob-lems reported by users is shown in Table 1. On the first line, we show the distribution among all respondents (first survey) and on the second line only those who had used a search engine to pursue information on the urgent matter at hand. Some differences are noticeable. While falls are the most common category among all respondents, they are less likely among those who used a search engine. A possible explanation is that people better understand actions appro-priate for helping with falls better than courses of action appropriate for many other scenarios. The seriousness of a situation, such as the onset of severe abdominal pain, and ideal actions for addressing a concern may be more confus-ing. For example,  X  X  try to see what was caus my abdominal pain but couldn X  X  really come up with anything X  and  X  X ince my pain was on my lower left side of my body, I did some Google searches on symptoms of appendix problems X  (we note that pain from appendicitis is typically experienced on the right or symmetrically across the abdomen ).

The respondents X  descriptions of the use of search engines shows a strong reliance on search. In some cases, online search precedes a visit to the emergency department (ED) to access information on what the problem might be and/or what action should be taken. Here is an example typical of the use of search as first responder:  X  X y father had a lot of pain in his left arm, and I looked up what it could be. It turned out he was having a mild heart attack based on my results we figured we should call 911. X  One person said  X  X  googled what to do after someone struggled swallowing food X  when his friend was choking on dinner. He performed the Heimlich Maneuver, and brought the friend to the hos-pital thereafter. In other situations, search engines are used to guide searchers through the steps of the treatment pro-cess, e.g.,  X  X  witnessed someone having a heart attack. I had to start cpr and had forgotten how. I quickly searched the cpr technique. X  In other cases, the searches follow a call to 911. For example, a user whose child was having convulsions searched for [first time seizure in toddler] and [seizure first aid] after calling 911. Another user  X  X  searched head injuries to see if there was anything else I could do while waiting for the ambulance. I searched: head injury immediate treat-ment. X 
Among those who used search engines, 83% were satis-fied and 17% were not satisfied with the information they had retrieved. Among the satisfied, some explained that they could not blame the search engine since their symptoms could mean the presence of many different conditions, e.g., there are many causes of abdominal pain. Those who were not satisfied with search provided a variety of complaints. The quality of displayed results were called into question by some, e.g., a participant whose girlfriend was hit by a car while walking mentioned,  X  X  just couldn X  X  find anything that I thought was reliable, well written information. I was also probably in a slight state of shock, so simplified articles would have been easier to digest. X  Others complained about advertisements, X  X he information that came back in bulk was mostly junk sites looking to earn revenue from ads. No real medical information. The couple of sites that did have okay info, such as webmd, were so wishy washy in answers due to litigation possibilities that it rendered their info worthless too. I finally found some good peer reviewed info. Good thing I know the medical jargon. X  Others complained about the quantity of search results  X  X here was just to much stuff that came up, in a situation when you are starting to panic you get overwelmed really quick, especially when you think you might be having a heart attack. X  Other participants de-scribed being moved to anxiety by results that turned out to be erroneous, e.g.,  X  X ess dire results. It kept telling me MeSH Positive Category (% ) Sample Queries from Positive Set MeSH Negative Category (% ) Sample Queries from Negative Sessions Pathological Conditions (7%) [weight loss patch], [ingrown toenail] I was probably having a heart attack just because I was ha ving what felt like chest pain but I wasn X  X . X  Summary of Survey Findings The survey showed that 12% of users turn to search engines for time-critical needs and 16% among smartphone users among our respondents have done so. We see from the responses that people are using search for symptom searches in pursuit of diagnoses and suggestions for what to do X  X nd that there is somewhat of a mismatch between general urgency and urgent search needs. The key findings are: (1) people rely on search en-gines for urgent needs, (2) search is often used as a first response in emergency situations, and (3) people are dis-satisfied with search results in terms of both quality and quantity of returned results, with advertisements appear-ing, and with the overall complexity of content. Many of these challenges could be met by search engines if they had the capability to understand the degree of urgency of users X  information needs, and could tailor the search experience accordingly.

The challenges and opportunities raised in the survey frame a larger research agenda on time-critical search, including efforts to detect the time-criticality surrounding a query, retrieving appropriate content, and the identification, con-struction or manual curation of content designed for assist-ing with action in urgent settings X  X hen people are likely under significant duress and cognitive load. We focus in this paper on one step of the process: on identifying when a user likely has a time-critical need. This triggering component is a crucial, early step in the pipeline of providing useful, timely help to users. We leave the task of finding or con-structing useful time-critical content as a future direction.
Search engine logs have been used to understand search behavior [33, 55], predict future activity and interests [37, 15], improve search engines [32, 2], and learn about the world [48, 11]. A search session is a contiguous sequence of queries from a user with a short time gap between searches [15].
As a means of tagging for time criticality, we assume in our study that a user has a time-critical health information need if they seek an urgent care facility during the search session. A user is noted as seeking assistance from an urgent care facility if they issue a query, call by phone, or seek driving directions to an emergency department.

Per the example in Figure 1, while we cannot be certain, this sequence appears to represent someone trying to diag-nose a possible stroke. The search for an emergency room suggests that they believe the situation to be urgent. We re-alize that numerous urgent health situations do not lead to such searches or calls to an emergency department. For ex-ample, information retrieved about the Heimlich Maneuver may be used to assist someone with choking without result-ing in a follow-on pursuit of professional medical assistance. Conversely, people may seek out emergency care in cases where it is not needed. For example, people with unfounded anxiety about their health [56] may search for an emergency room when such medical attention is not necessary. Nev-ertheless, we propose that searches for emergency medical assistance are dominated by user-perceived time-criticality. We explore this further in Section 5.

We seek to build and evaluate predictive models that can identify a user in a time-critical situation. More specifically, given a user X  X  search history and current search session, we seek to predict if they are in a time-critical situation. To do so, we employ supervised machine learning to develop a classifier, leveraging sets of features and labeled data derived from in situ search behavior.
We now describe how we automatically generate training data, i.e., positive and negative time-critical sessions. To better understand the nature of this data and to help verify the utility of our method for automatically generating time-critical labels, we also characterize a small sample into an existing medical taxonomy. We describe each of these steps in the remainder of this section.
We opt for the automated labeling of user sessions given related challenges found with using human judges to assess relevance [2], and the difficulty that we believe that human annotators may experience in reliably labeling true urgency solely from search queries. However, we cannot assume that such phrases as  X  X mergency room X  indicate a time-critical need, as such phrases can be used in other contexts, e.g., the television show ER. Broader contextual information, such as follow on searches can help with the discrimination task. These challenges motivate the following method: 1. Identify sessions containing health queries. 2. Remove sessions containing adult content. 3. Among the remaining sessions, if a session contains a Step (1) tends to eliminate non-health information needs. Step (2) is a filter to improve data quality. Step (3) elim-inates sessions that switch away from the health, demon-strating that the searcher is not consumed by the situation and that it may not truly be urgent.
To verify that the remaining sessions are labeled correctly and to glean insights about the operation of the automated labeling procedure, we randomly sampled 50 examples of positive and negative cases from the tagged set. We man-ually categorized these sessions into the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) hierarchy produced by the National Li-brary of Medicine [39]. The top categories of the positive and negative sessions are shown in Table 2.

The top positive sessions are generally of a more urgent nature than the negative sessions, including queries that seek such information on broken bones, pneumonia in children, and diagnosis of appendicitis. However, individual queries are not sufficient for distinguishing time-critical from non-urgent settings. For example, [pregnancy calculator] appears in both positive and negative data, but the surrounding con-text is different. In the positive set, the query was posed in an Ale House, while in the negative data, the query was posed in a residential area. We revisit the broader query context, considering such factors as location, in Section 6.
Among the positive cases sampled, we found that one ses-sion was clearly non-urgent (user seeking an emergency cen-ter for Vicodin to evade a drug test for a construction job). Other sessions labeled as positive include those where we are uncertain about the true urgency of a situation (e.g., emer-gency room needed for strep throat). However, we note that our goal is to predict when users believe they have an urgent need and seek urgent care. We do not intend for search to take on the role of an expert diagnostician.

The top five categories of the negative examples are also shown in Table 2. We note that a large subset of sessions do not include health-related queries, i.e., the health query cat-egorizer mistakenly fires. Such queries may contain health-related terms, such as [what makes blood boil] and [pro-tein shakes]. Ideally, the health query categorizer would not make such mistakes. Nevertheless, these sessions truly are negative cases, so the time-critical classifier should learn to label these sessions negative.

Among the categories that fall into the MeSH hierarchy, the largest negative category is Reproductive Phenomena . This category contains queries such as [pregnancy tests]. Among the remaining categories, medication-related searches are common, e.g., [tylenol] and [melatonin]. Cancer-related sessions are also common.

While the category Pathological Conditions is common to both the positive and negative training data, we found that the queries in the positive examples are of a more acute na-ture. The positive set contains [kidney stones], [chest pain], and [throwing up foam] while the negative data contains [weight loss patch] and [ingrown toenail].
To identify a query as urgent, we defined several obser-vational features. These features include characteristics of the user, historical behavior of all previous users who issued the query, words in queries observed thus far in the session, situated features related to topical and behavioral aspects in the session, as well as temporal and geospatial character-istics. A full description of these features can be found in Table 3. We now explain the rationale behind the selection of features.
Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), based on ED visits between 1997-2011, show that 20% of adults visited an ED in the 12-month period, and 7% visited the ED twice or more in that period [19]. By studying a user X  X  longitudinal search behavior, we can better estimate the likelihood that their current need is urgent. For example, if a user already displays evidence of seeking urgent medical attention (e.g., via the presence of searches for professional health care) in the time period preceding the current health search, it may be less likely that they have an urgent health need related to the current query.

Other features of searchers X  longitudinal search behavior may be useful for predicting an urgent need. For example, if a searcher typically issues long queries but the average query length in the current session is extremely short, the reduc-tion in length may indicate something about the atypical urgency of information needs at the current time.
Query statistics about the query and browsing behavior of populations of searchers provide additional information. For example, the timing and nature of query refinements and clickthrough information on search results can provide insights about the adequacy of results. To this end, we in-clude several historical query statistics for current health query in our analysis, including the frequency with which the query was received by the search engine and the corre-sponding clickthrough rate on search results.
The terms appearing in the queries observed in the session provide some insight into the nature of searchers X  informa-tion needs. The presence of words such as [help] provide direct evidence of urgent information needs. However, more subtle clues about time criticality may be present in a user X  X  query stream, e.g., the mention of symptoms such as [chest pain] or [choking], coupled with the presence of other terms such as [tightness] or [trouble breathing]. Rather than speci-fying the words in advance of the prediction, by including the words directly as a feature, our models have the opportunity to learn which terms are important. Queries triggered by the automatic labeling scheme, e.g.,[emergency room] were not included in the bag of words as the existence of such terms would determine the label of the session. We use the query words as a baseline in the prediction experiments presented later in the paper.
Features describing the current situation of the user could be most telling about whether the information being sought is urgent in nature. To capture aspects of the users X  context, we developed a number of classes of features to represent be havioral, topical, temporal, and geospatial aspects of the user X  X  current situation. We refer to these observations as situated features.
 Behavioral Aspects of user search behavior may reveal ad-ditional distinctions about information needs. Search behav-iors, such as the average number of clicks associated with a particular query, have been used in previous research to un-derstand the nature of the search intent, e.g., to distinguish between informational and navigational search queries [53]. We hypothesize that search behaviors may also be useful in distinguishing urgent from non-urgent needs. For example, urgent needs may manifest as a rapid sequence of overlap-ping short queries, and less urgent queries may be charac-terized by longer inter-query times and more clickthrough on content as searchers have the time to examine multiple results in detail. To this end, we consider such attributes as the number of queries issued in the session so far, the aver-age time between those queries, and the number of search results that were visited by searchers.
 Topical We believed that the level of fluctuation in a user X  X  topical interests and the sudden emergence of new topics could by triggered by an urgent need. Topic-based features capture the dynamics of interests in the session so far, as well as the relationship between the topics that the user is interested in and those observed in their long-term search behavior. We hypothesize that, because urgent events are rare, the emergence of a new topic (e.g., the initiation of a health search) would reveal something about the rarity of those events and increase the likelihood that an unforeseen health event is occurring. We also consider the dynamism of the searcher X  X  information needs within the session, e.g., to what extent are their topical interests stable (including the past history of health queries), and whether there is a change in topical interests at the point in time where health queries assume the focus of attention.

We assigned topic labels to queries by automatically clas-sifying the content of the top-ranked search results returned for the search engine for that query. If no results were returned by the engine, no label was assigned. Topic la-bels were taken from the 219 topics from the top two lev-els of the Open Directory Project (ODP, http://dmoz.org), and included topics such as  X  X ealth/Medicine X  and  X  X ecre-ation/Sports X . The topics were assigned to pages based on their content using a text-based classifier described and eval-uated in [6]. The coverage of the classifier across all result URLs in our test set was 96.8%; the remaining 3.2% of URLs were unreachable at feature generation time.
 Temporal Circadian rhythms play a role in people X  X  health and well-being, and people are more prone to injury at cer-tain times of the day. For example, the most dangerous times for heart attack and for other cardiovascular emergen-cies, including sudden cardiac death, rupture or aneurysm of the aorta, pulmonary embolism and stroke are the morning and during the last phase of sleep. A recent study showed that there is a threefold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction in the three hours after waking, related to oscil-lations in the cardiovascular system [42]. Time of day may also be indicative of the degree of surprise in a rising health concern. A health query arriving at 2:00am may be more remarkable (and indicative of an unforeseen health event) than a health query arriving in the middle of the day.
Time also influences the nature of the activities that peo-ple are likely to be performing. During business hours (9AM-5PM) on weekdays, people may be engaged in sedentary and safe activities in office environments. In the evenings and on weekends people may more typically pursue other interests, bringing them into situations with higher risk of injury and of placing additional strain on their bodies X  X nd creating op portunity for unforeseen accidents. Indeed, examining the positive examples in our data as a function of time-of-day and day-of-week, we observe a greater likelihood of urgent health searching occurring outside of working hours and on weekends (Table 4). Note that this differs from when emer-gency rooms are more likely to receive visits [18], suggesting that urgent search engine temporal patterns may differ from ER visit patterns.

In addition to the absolute time at which a query is is-sued, we also consider whether the health search of interest is conducted during daylight hours. Hours of darkness vary depending on geographic location as well as time of year, and the presence of darkness has been shown to affect in-jury likelihoods; accident statistics have shown that fatal vehicular accidents are three times more likely at night than during the day [54].
 Geospatial Location may provide strong evidence about the nature of the searcher X  X  current situation [3]. We com-pute proximity to locations where we suspect people might be engaged in physical activity (parks, pitches, running tracks, and recreation grounds) and locations where large numbers of people are likely to gather (e.g., at stadiums or shop-ping malls) or EMS is hard to reach. Since children may be particularly susceptible to injury, we also use the distance from the location of the query to the nearest school. Since speed of motion might reveal something about urgency, we include both the current velocity and distance traveled since last search query as features.

In addition to considering the activities that people are likely to perform, we also consider the likelihood that they could readily receive medical attention at their current lo-cation. We compute the distance from query location to the nearest urgent care center, including EDs of hospitals. If a searcher is near a medical facility, one might argue that the query itself is less likely to represent a genuine cry for help as medical attention is immediately available. We also consider other details about the surrounding environment. We consider whether the query was issued while the user was over water (user is likely on a boat) and the altitude of the user at query time (e.g., if high, user may be hik-ing or climbing). Both of these features provide evidence of difficulty in reaching medical care soon and could influence searchers turning to their mobile devices to seek assistance so as to guide decisions about a course of action in advance of receiving professional medical assistance.
We develop a classifier that can distinguish between the positives and negatives using the set of features described above. As the data is heavily skewed to negatives, a clas-sification policy that always predicts negative would have a high classification accuracy. For our initial study, we sample a smaller set from the negatives, so that we have an equal number of positives and negatives [30]. The benefit of such downsampling is that the performance of a random guessing baseline is 50%. Such an event split enables us to tease out the effects of including various features.

While the study of classification constructed with bal-anced data can build insights, that target is use in a realistic setting. Our second set of experiments probe the value of the methods in a realistic scenario: we train on one month of data and test on the following month with actual statis-Figure 2: ROC curves comparing the performance of classifiers trained on user features, historic query statistics, words in the query, situated signals and all queries. tics as seen in logs. Particular emphasis is given to positive precision and positive recall. We also demonstrate that accu-racy improves as the amount of session data used for feature generation increases.
We collected six months of search activity from Bing mo-bile search spanning 9/2012 through 2/2013. The appli-cation is typically installed on tablets and mobile devices. The mobile logs contain search queries, clicks, timestamp, and real-time latitude and longitude users who consented to share data when setting up the application. As expected, the data is severely skewed towards the negative examples; we found 536 positive examples and 945,989 negative exam-ples (99.4% negatives and 0.6% positives).
 In our experiments, we train a boosted tree classifier [21]. We perform a 10-fold cross validation, repeating each 10 times. Results are reported in terms of precision and recall. Positive precision is the fraction of sessions predicted time-critical that actually are time critical. Positive recall is the fraction of actual time-critical sessions that are predicted time-critical (and similarly for negative precision and recall).
Our first experiment uses balanced data, constructed via downsampling. We assess the predictive power of different categories of features by separately training classifiers with distinct sets of features per the categories of features in Sec-tion 6, i.e., words in the query, user features, historic query statistics, situated only features, and all features. We assess each of the categories separately to understand their intrin-sic benefit. An alternative is to perform feature ablations, but that depends highly on the order in which features are removed and is affected by interactions between feature cat-egories.

The classical approach for text categorization [16] involves representing the query as a bag of words. Phrases are not known to add predictive power over words [4], so we focus sessions are more likely on the weekends and night time/early morning. Monday 14% 15% -1 12am-3am 16% 13% +3 Tu esday 12% 15% -3 3am-6am 17% 15% +2 Wednesday 11% 15% -4 6am-9am 16% 16% 0 Thursday 13% 15% -2 9am-12pm 18% 18% 0 Friday 13% 13% 0 12pm-3pm 10% 20% -10 Saturday 19% 13% +6 3pm-6pm 8% 9% -1 Sunday 18% 14% +4 6pm-9pm 7% 3% +4 Features Accuracy Positive Positive Negative Negative Area U nder on words only. Since our underlying data comprises search se ssions, our bag of words contains all queries up to and including the first health query of a session. As our goal is early detection of time criticality, we seek to detect time-criticality after the arrival of the first health query. The overall accuracy of the bag-of-words classifier is 66% and a detailed breakdown by precision and recall is displayed in Table 5.
 Next, we experimented with historical query statistics. These features are based on the activity trails of users who had issued the query. A categorizer built exclusively on these features is 61% accurate. The features with the most pre-dictive power are average amount of time spent on clicked search results, average time to first click, and features related to switching search engines. All of these features capture a user in a more panicked state, i.e., dwelling less, clicking faster, and quickly shifting to another search engine in hope of finding better content.

We found that user-related features have little predic-tive power in themselves. The overall accuracy of classi-fiers based solely on user-related features is 55%, which is only marginally better than random guessing 50%. Such a result is not unexpected as relying solely on a user X  X  be-havior preceding the current session is not likely to contain enough information to predict time-criticality on a future emergency.

Harnessing situation-related features (topics, location, al-titude, proximity to sites and resources, and time of day) enables classification of time criticality with a classification accuracy of 77%, with significant boosts in positive and neg-ative precision and recall. Digging deeper into these situa-tional features, the most predictive are session-related and include the number of new and unique topics by the user. Other situational features are related to what we can infer from a user X  X  location, specifically distance to closest sta-dium, hospital, park, mall, retail store, and school. These features suggest that the user is away from home, e.g., at-tending an event in a stadium or park, shopping at a mall or store, or in a playground at school. The next highest-ranked feature by predictive power is altitude. We could identify time-critical sessions in mountainous regions where a mobile device may be the only source of information. Note that situational features perform better than bag of words despite the fact that there are many more word features (2132 words vs. 43 situated).

Finally, we trained a classifier on all of the above features and achieved an accuracy of 82%. It is striking that the situ-ational features provide a great deal of the predictive power of the classifier. The exact words in the query do not matter as much as the circumstances of the user. Figure 2 shows a receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve comparing the performance of classifiers based on (1) user, (2) query statis-tics, (3) bag of words (4) situational, and (5) all features. All paired differences in differences in accuracy are strongly statistically significant using a t -tests ( p -value &lt; 0.001).
In a more realistic scenario, we can train and test on a larger set of negative data. In the next experiment, we train on sessions collected in January 2013 and evaluate on ses-sions collected in February 2013. The breakdown of data in January 2013 is 139 positives, 230K negatives and February 2013 is similar 136 positives, 238K negatives. The positives are needles in a haystack of negatives. Although they are rare, they may represent an extremely critical information need. Using all the features, we now compare our ability to predict time criticality after the first and after the last health query in a session. The goal is to show that even if we miss a time-critical session after the first health query, we can still flag it as the session progresses. Note that we must be care-ful not to use words later in the session that contain time-critical facilities such as  X  X mergency room, X a  X  A  X  I since that is how we labeled sessions positive. Thus, queries containing time-critical facilities are not included in the bag of words. Session features can get richer as the session progresses, so there is potential for improving prediction performance by employing features beyond the first health query, including Session-depth Accuracy Positive Positive Negative Negative Area Under First health query 0.999 0.875 0.883 0.999 0.999 0.999 La st health query 0.999 0.888 0.928  X  1 0.999 0.999 such behavioral information as whether a user shifted to a no n-urgent topic.
 The results for the realistic setting are shown in Table 6. Total accuracy, as well as negative precision and recall, are not important in this experiment, as a classifier that labels every example negative will have good performance for these measures. Instead, we attend to the positive precision and positive recall. Positive precision (88%) is higher than seen in the experiment with downsampled data (82%). However, there is not much difference in positive precision between the first and last health query on all data. Conversely, positive recall improves with using information up to the last health-related query (from 88% to 93%); more session data means more opportunity to detect time criticality.
We provided evidence that people turn to search engines for urgent needs. Via surveys and large-scale search log anal-ysis, we quantified and characterized urgent behavior. We identified a set of novel predictive features, especially those that are situational in nature, including location, altitude, proximity to specific sites and resources, and time of day. Using these features, we developed a machine learning clas-sifier that can provide accurate predictions about the level of urgency associated with search sessions. These predic-tions can be used by search systems to determine whether specialized ranking or interface support should be offered. Our work has limitations that are important to consider. First, as mentioned earlier, the AMT population is known to be biased in a variety of ways [44]. We asked crowdworkers for their gender and state of residence to determine if our samples were overly skewed. However, we did not ask for in-come and other potentially relevant demographics. In addi-tion, search engine logs inherently reflect a biased population of the US. For example, we may be missing signals from peo-ple who do not have access to computers or search engines. Finally, the training data that we generate is also imperfect: a user may search for an emergency room and not really be in an urgent state and users facing a time-critical situ-ation may not search for or call a nearby emergency room. To address this, more work is needed on methods to attain ground truth about urgency from logged searchers, perhaps by constructing pools of consenting searchers who are will-ing to share additional details about their search situations in addition to their logged search activity.

Our findings have several implications for search engines and IR more broadly. Search engines should consider esti-mated urgency as an important aspect of the retrieval. Rec-ognizing urgency of a session or an individual search query is only a first step in a larger pipeline of time-critical anal-ysis, content generation, and information display. Multiple designs for assistance are feasible and need to be studied. These designs extend beyond IR. For example, if search en-gines can determine that a user has an urgent need, actions such as notifying emergency services might be taken.
We believe that time-critical search is important and un-derexplored. By coupling machine learning along with defin-ing a set of rich situational features, we showed that time-critical queries can be detected automatically. The findings of this study are promising. Nevertheless, much work re-mains on developing and evaluating retrieval technologies to support searchers faced with urgent, emergency situa-tions. One of the key challenges is providing users with ac-cess to content that is easy to comprehend and is actionable in real-time, considering distractions and cognitive load in urgent situations. Even relevant pages may contain complex and lengthy textual descriptions and obfuscating advertise-ments and graphics. The automatic identification of accu-rate, succinct, and visually compelling videos or easy-to-digest graphics on procedures could be of tremendous help to people with urgent needs. In addition, the mobile phone provides additional sensors (location, microphone, camera, accelerometer) that could assist a user beyond web pages. We believe that there is great promise in combining meth-ods for identifying urgent information needs with methods for identifying or generating content  X  as well as using the phone as a sensor  X  to develop an end-to-end approach at assisting searchers in time-critical settings.
