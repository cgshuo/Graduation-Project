A brief summary of the contribution of the paper is as follows: 1. We defined and modelled geographical scopes as a kind of document (see Sections 3.1 and 3.2 ). 2. We resolve geographical scope of a document prior to disambiguation of places mentioned inside the document. performance of 71%  X  80% on human annotated news articles (see Sections 4.1 and 4.2 ). motivated queries (see Sections 5 and 6 ). 2.

The matching score between document d and geographical scope g is computed as: where, n is the number of place names in the document, z the number of geographical zones, w for a match in a target-region zone than a match in a parent-region zone.
To demonstrate the use of Eq. (1) , consider documents d 1 d i = {Netherlands, Groningen, Leiden} d 2 = {Groningen, Leiden, Lisse}.

Using the sample reference scope for the Netherlands shown in Table 3 , the documents, d as follows:
The score formula ranks document d 1 higher than d 2 in the scope of Netherlands , i.e., document d
Eq. (1) becomes: the seat of the national government. Therefore, each place is assigned an importance weight p size or economy, and score formula in Eq. (2) becomes: where, p i ( j ) is the importance attached to place j in zone i . To demonstrate consider document d names they contain as follows: d 3 = {The Hague} d 3 = {Rotterdam}.

To model each scope with GeoVIP information, GeoVIPs are grouped into five levels:  X  president of the country.  X  ministers are included in this group.  X  the Parliament or the Senate are included in this group.  X  neighbouring countries are listed.  X  will be mentioned in the same story on Middle East .

The following observations can be made from the results: achieved the worst performance in comparison to the default Lucene and the scope-based ( SCO ) scheme. integration of geographical metadata such as toponyms into query expansion procedure. 6. Relevance ranking through weighted harmonic means. 6.1. Scope-based metric where wt ( q , s ) is the weight assigned to scope s in query q by the scope resolver, and wt structure the scope-based similarity measure in a fashion that favours query scopes over document scopes. 6.2. Type-based metric railroad, S is spot, T is hypsographic, U is undersea and V is vegetation. The type based relevance measure is defined as: where; N qFClass is the number of occurrences of the required query feature class in the document, and N number of N qFClass is equal to N qFType . This happens when all features of type FType are of class FClass . 6.3. Combining geographical and non-geographical metrics geographical relevance measures to a unified relevance measures. 6.3.1.

Harmonic mean interpolation are derived as a consequence of harmonic mean combination: 1. if  X  =1, equal importance is attached to both non-geographical and geographical relevance. 2. if  X  =0, no importance is attached to non-geographical relevance. 3. if  X  =  X  , no importance is attached to geographical relevance.

The interesting feature of this combination is that an optimal value of 6.3.3. Extended harmonic mean combination weighted harmonic mean (WHM) combination (see Eq. (20) ) as follows:
