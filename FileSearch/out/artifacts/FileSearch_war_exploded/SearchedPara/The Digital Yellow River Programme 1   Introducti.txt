To pursue the harmonious development of natural resources, economy and society in the Yellow River basin, the Digital Yellow River Programme (DYRP) was initiated by Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC) in 2002. In DYRP, an transmission, data storage and service is to be created using modern technology, such effectiveness of decision-making, six application systems namely flood prevention and disaster mitigation, water resource management and regulation, water and soil conservation, water preservation, engineering project management, and e-governance are also to be developed. Furthermore, a comprehensive conferencing and decision-conferencing environment. 
The components of the Digital Yellow River Programme include the infrastructure, application service platform, application systems, and programme ensuring system. The system architecture is showing in Fig. 1. According to the practical demands of Yellow River management, six application prevention and disaster mitigation, water resource management and regulation, water preservation, water and land conservation, engineering project management, and e-governance. 
The application systems will cover various aspects of Yellow River harnessing and management. Each system should be logically independent, complete and inter-system architecture of the Digital Yellow River Programme should always be adopted for new system development so that the system can be well connected with other applications and the application service platform. Resource sharing must be empha-reused to the maximum extent, in order to stabilize the transition process from an old system to a new one. 2.1 Flood Prevention and Disaster Mitigation The flood prevention and disaster mitigation system includes flood warning, reservoir operation, flood prevention organization and command, flood routing, risk manage-ment, disaster mitigation, etc. The system is developed with flood prevention organi-zation and command as its core.

Decision alternatives are generated for any significant event through different application sys-tems on different decision-making levels based on their own business objectives and business logic. The decision-making envir onment provides a software environment that can virtually simulate all kinds of scenarios with virtual reality technology, and a conferencing facility so that any and all expertise can be exchanged during the deci-sion-making process. With help from the decision support system, the decision-making process would progress more smoothly and more effectively and decisions could be made more promptly. 
Comprehensive decision-making is a basin-wide strategy and is a significant issue; tency and synchronization in the organization. allocation of resources and sharing of data, techniques, models and other resources in order to provide standardized technology and other basis for the development and integration of application systems. The main functions of the platform are application service and resource management. The application service platform is logically com-posed of business middleware, databases, knowledgebase, and model libraries. 3.1 Application Service Middleware logic and application logic. Data sharing and integrated data management is the fundamental purpose of the information from various sources of systems with heterogeneous structure, through the standardization of data accessing interface, to meet the demand of direct or indi-rect access from various applications. 
Most of the water information data is geographically specific. Combining GIS and internet/intranet middleware technology to develop the spatial information processing logic and geographic information analysis and processing can be standardized and normalized. Spatial information processing logic is classified into fundamental geo-graphic information processing logic, fundamental remote sensing image processing logic and 3-dimensional virtual reality processing logic. 
Business logic modules are the software packages composed of all kinds of basic business processing units. They are developed with the distributed object technology essing logic. Application logic includes busi ness processing logic, model service, and the supporting services from the existing systems. 3.2 Data Warehouse and Knowledgebase river morphology, and water resources assessment, and to support online analysis and processing through data mining technology. The knowledgebase is the expansion and extension of database concepts in the area of knowledge processing. The Knowledge Base Management System (KBMS) is used for effective management when there are many elements in the knowledge set. General KBM systems involve key technologies such as knowledge acquisition, knowledge denotation, organization, maintenance and use of the knowledgebase. 3.3 Model Library Numerical models are the technological core of digitalized processing. Models in the library contain river basin simulation models, management and decision-making sup-business requirements. The model library system consists of a management system, model library, model dictionary, and model driving system. The models can be gener-ally classified into fundamental spatial information models, professional models, and common models. The infrastructure of the DYRP primarily consists of the data collection system, data transmission system, and data storing and management system, which are responsible for the collection, transmission, and storage and management of information, respec-operation of each application system of the programme. 4.1 Data Collection System The data collection system primarily consists of a fundamental spatial data collection system and professional domain data collection system. The fundamental spatial data the development of the fundamental geographical information system. This system collects information from different scales, various sources and multiple platforms The professional domain data collection system consists of information collection systems or monitoring systems for information collection of hydrology and meteorol-age, drought, water quality, water and soil conservation, and hydraulic structure. Input and update of fundamental database and professional domain database is another for solutions to unexpected significant problems. 4.2 Communication and Computer Network The communication and computer network will be established in the four areas with different administrative jurisdictions and regional characteristics. These areas are the upper and middle reach of the Yellow River, Yumenkou-Sanmenxia, Sanmenxia-Huayuankou reach, and the reach below Huayuankou. The network will rely on opti-cal cables, digital microwaves, communication satellites, public telecommunication networks and other computer network resources, combine public and professional networks, and determine bandwidth and relevant parameters of the network based on data volume. Using data modes to construct a four-level broadband network and cor-responding network safety infrastructures covering all organizations above the county stations and sluices, and connect with governing departments of water sectors of prov-inces or municipalities along the Yellow River. 4.3 Data Storage and Process System Data models are to be built through the integration of information resources using the objective-oriented technology with unified data standards. Databases, including the all interested sectors. 
The Yellow River Data Center and its sub-centers are to be created and organized according to the fundamental principles of authorized organizations. The data owners who are responsible for data collection should take responsibility for data update and River Data Center and its seven distributed sub-centers are to be created on the basis of ensuring the integrity and consistency of data. A disaster backup data-center is also Center, the seven sub-centers, and the Disaster Backup Center form a complete combination of SAN and NAS technology is adopted to improve the reliability, sharing and integration. programme. The ensuring system consists of policies, regulations, organizations, standards, and specifications, along with the technological support. This system the programme. 
The DYRP is a very complicated, dynamic and systematic programme because: (1) hydraulics, water resources, environment, ecology, communication, remote sensing, computing, networking, software engineering, economics, legislation, and project management; (2) it evolves continuously as new technology develops; and (3) its projects must be executed by many organizations with different responsibilities under YRCC, while YRCC has a very complex organizational structure. This programme must be executed or implemented via many projects because of the aforementioned complexities and constraints. Management of DYRP is a way to regulate project management because those related projects not managed as a programme are likely to initiative. 
In the Digital Yellow River Initiative, the programme framework with programme management of DYRP is likely to include the following aspects: organizational management, resource management, and technological management. For instance, in institutional management, a complete standard system must be created and adopted to must be observed for the standardization and normalization of construction and operation of the project. ICT infrastructure is a modern measure towards a better river basin management. DYRP has been playing an important role in the YRCC business activities. To achieve the desired outcome, more efforts will be added in the next several years.
