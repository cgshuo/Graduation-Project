 The time-bound hierarchical key assignment problem is to assign time sensitive keys to security classes in a partially ordered hierarchy so that legal data accesses among classes can be enforced. Two time-bound hierarchical key assign-ment schemes have been proposed in the literature, but both of them were proved insecure against collusive attacks. In this paper, we will propose an RSA-based time-bound hier-archical key assignment scheme and describe its possible ap-plication. The security analysis shows that the new scheme is safe against the collusive attacks.

Depending on the security clearance, users in an organi-zation can be divided into a set of disjointed user classes C = { C 1 ,C 2 ,...,C m } . The set of classes usually can be organized as a hierarchical tree if they are partially ordered by a binary relation  X   X . C j C i denotes that the class C i has a higher or equal security clearance than the class C . Thus, users in C i is allowed to access the data items owned by users in C j , but the access in the opposite direc-tion is prohibited. Many key assignment schemes have been proposed in the literature to enforce the hierarchical access control problem [1, 3, 4, 5, 8].

In 2002, Tzeng [7] proposed a time-bound hierarchical key assignment scheme. He claimed that his scheme not only provides a solution for the hierarchical access control prob-lem, but also has an additional feature that each class has different data encryption keys for different time periods. To describe the feature more specifically, time is divided into a sequence of z periods, from period 1 to period z . In each time period t , each class C j will be assigned a data encryp-tion key K j,t to encrypt its data to prevent illegal accesses. Also, each user in the system has an assigned valid time in-class C i , he is able to derive the encryption key K j,t crypt the encrypted data in class C j if, and only if, C j and t 1  X  t  X  t 2 . This feature enhances the applicability of the key assignment approach for some online applications such as digital TV broadcasting and electronic news broad-casting [7]. However, Yi and Ye [9] pointed out that Tzeng X  X  scheme is not secure against collusive attacks. After Tzeng X  X  scheme was proved insecure, Chien proposed another time-bound hierarchical key assignment scheme [2] in 2004, based on tamper-resistant devices. Unfortunately, Santis, Ferrara, and Masucci [6] showed that three malicious users can collu-sively misuse the tamper-resistant devices to compute some secret keys that they should not know.

In this paper, we will propose a new scheme which is based on the RSA algorithm. The remainder of this paper is or-ganized as follows. Section 2 presents the new time-bound cryptographic key assignment scheme, which is followed by a security analysis in Section 3. Section 4 describes a possible application -online electronic article subscription system.
The new scheme is based on the RSA algorithm. Sup-pose the hierarchy has m classes { C 1 ,C 2 ,...,C m } and the time is divided into z periods, starting at period 1. Similar to Tzeng X  X  and Chien X  X  schemes, there is a trusted Central Authority (CA) responsible for generating and distributing keys. The CA performs the following: 1. The CA chooses two distinct large primes p and q , and 2. For each C i , the CA chooses a distinct integer e i , which 3. For each period y , the CA chooses a distinct integer g 4. The CA chooses a number a , 1 &lt; a &lt; n , and computes 5. The CA publishes the parameters e 1 ,e 2 , ...,e m , g
User Registration: When a user is assigned to C i for a time interval [ t 1 ,t 2 ], the CA assigns a user key K i, ( t
Encryption Key Generation: The CA assigns a data encryption key K i,t for each C i in each time period t , 1  X  t  X  z , where K i,t = ( K i ) h t mod n .
Decryption Key Derivation: A user who is in C i for the time interval [ t 1 ,t 2 ] can use the user key K i, ( t with some public parameters to derive the data encryption key K j,t of C j for the time period t if, and only if, C and t 1  X  t  X  t 2 . The key derivation is as follows. ( K
An Example: Figure 1 shows a six-class hierarchy. As-sume that the time is divided into five periods 1, 2, ... , 5. Fig.1. An example of a hierarchical policy with six classes A user in C 2 from time period 2 to 4 has the user key K 2 , (2 , 4) . This user can derive the following data encryption For example, to derive K 5 , 3 , the user computes ( K
Performance: Given K i, ( t 1 ,t 2 ) and public parameters with which to derive K j,t , the user needs to compute ( K The above computation requires r + t 2  X  t 1 modular expo-nentiations, where r is the number of classes C k that satisfy C k C i and C k 6 C j . The key derivation complexity is the same as that of Tzeng X  X  scheme.
Attack by an Outsider: An outsider, with only knowl-edge of public parameters e i  X  X  and g y  X  X , may try to derive a key in the system such as K i , K i, ( t 1 ,t 2 ) , or K the keys are generated based on secret parameters a , d i or h y  X  X , the outsider has no way to know any of them.
Attack by an Insider: Using the same example shown in Figure 1, a user in C 2 , with a key K 2 , (2 , 4) , is unable to derive the data encryption keys not in the set { K 2 , 2 , K K user is unable to derive the key K 6 , 3 . ( K By adding one more step above, the number a can be de-rived. Knowing a provides no help in deriving data encryp-tion keys, since it is necessary to compute modular expo-nentiations with unknown exponents. Again, the security of the scheme relies on the same computational difficulty that the RSA algorithm is based upon: given a message a , it is not feasible to forge someone X  X  signature, a d mod n , on the message a without knowing the private key d .

Attack by a group of insiders: Given a data en-cryption key K i,t = a d 0 h t mod n , where d 0 = Q C even if both a d 0 and a h t (mod n ) are separately derived by a group of malicious users, they are still unable to compute a pose that a user A in C 2 , with the key K 2 , (1 , 3) , conspires with another user B in C 5 , with the key K 5 , (1 , 5) try to collusively derive the data encryption key K a the RSA algorithm, with knowledge of a , a d 2 d 4 d 5 mod n and a within a reasonable amount of time.
This section uses ACM as an example to describe a possi-ble application -electronic article subscription system. ACM periodically publishes different journals. In order to have more subscription options for subscribers, ACM may pro-vide different subscription packages. These packages form a hierarchical structure as follows. The hierarchy has n leaf nodes if ACM has n different journals. A leaf node in the hierarchy corresponds to one, and only one, journal, whereas an internal node in the hierarchy represents a package hav-ing multiple journals. All journals listed in a package C are also listed in its predecessors C i in the hierarchy, where C j C i . Assume that each fiscal year is a unit time pe-riod for subscription. The subscribers normally subscribe a package for multiple years, from time period t 1 to t 2 .
The proposed new scheme can provide an access control solution to such electronic article subscription system. Each leaf node C j in the hierarchy will be assigned a data encryp-tion key K j,t during each time period t . Each journal (cor-responds to a leaf node) published in each time period t will be encrypted by the leaf node X  X  data encryption key to pre-vent unauthorized accesses. When a subscriber subscribes a package C i from time period t 1 to t 2 , he/she will be assigned a user key K i, ( t 1 ,t 2 ) . Suppose that a journal is listed in the subscribed package C i and its corresponding leaf node is C With the user key K i, ( t 1 ,t 2 ) , the subscriber is able to access the journal published in the time period t by first deriving the data encryption key K j,t , where t 1  X  t  X  t 2 .
