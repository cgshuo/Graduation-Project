 Since Chinese text is written without natural delimiters such as whitespaces, word segmentation is the essential first step in Chinese language processing [1]. Over the past two decades, various methods have been developed to address this issue [2 X 7]. Generally, supervised statistical learning methods are more robust in processing unrestricted texts than the traditional dictionary-based methods. text processing, there is neither enough annotated homogeneous corpora for cumstances, unsupervised methods are preferred to utilize the linguistic knowl-edge derived from the raw corpus itself. Many researches also explores human-computer interactive segmentation process, enabling users to add expert knowl-edge to the system [8, 9]. Since the criteria of word segmentation is sometimes dependent on users, interactive segmentation is reasonable [10].
 read the raw segmentation result produced by the statistical model. Zhu et al. proposed a Kalman filter based human-computer interactive learning model for segmenting Chinese texts depending upon neither lexicon nor any annotated cor-pus [11]. This approach enables users to observe and intervene the segmentation results, while the segmenter learns and adapts to these knowledge iteratively. At the end of this procedure a segmentation result that fully matches the demand of the user is returned.

 reviews the Kalman filter based approach. In Section 5, we presents the design of our practical segmentation system for ancient Chinese texts. In Section 6, the evaluation is presented, and the final section concludes this paper and discusses possible future work. Unsupervised word segmentation is generally based on some predefined criteria, such as mutual information ( mi ), to recognize a substring as a word. Sproat and Shih studied comprehensively in this direction using mutual information [12]. Many successive research applied mutual information with different ensemble methods [13, 14]. Sun et al. designed an algorithm based on the linear combi-length gain [16], assessor variety [17] and branch entropy [18] are also explored. word segmentation and POS-tagging on pre-Qin ancient Chinest texts [19]. the particular need of users. Thus human-computer interactive strategies are explored to allow users to bring their linguistic knowledge into the segmenter by intervening the segmentation process. Wang et al. developed a sentence-based human-computer interaction inductive learning method [8]. Feng et al. proposed a certainty-based active learning segmentation algorithm, which uses an EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm to train an n -gram language model in an unsupervised learning framework [20]. Li and Chen further explored a candidate words based human-computer interactive segmentation strategy [21].
 nal state of a linear dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements. Recent researches have introduced Kalman filter model to promote user experience of Internet applications, by estimating click-through rate (CTR) of available arti-cles (or other objects on web pages) in near real-time for news display systems [23]. Zhu et al. applied Kalman filter model to learn and estimate user intentions in their human-computer interactive word segmentation framework [11]. 3.1 Baseline Model mutual information ( mi ) and designed a compound statistical measure based on the linear combination of mi and dts , named md [15]. mutual information of any given bigram xy , and dts ( x,y ) is the normalized difference of t-score of bigram xy . Given any bigram xy , in terms of md ( x,y ) and a threshold  X  , whether this bigram be combined or seperated can be determined  X  when md ( x,y ) is greater than  X  , the bigram xy is marked as combined ; otherwise, it is marked as separated .
 mum of md appears [3]. Consider a Chinese character string wxyz . If md ( x,y ) &gt; minima follow a similar definition. It can be seen that even a md ( x,y ) of a local maximum does not reach the threshold  X  , xy may still be combined, while if md ( x,y ) of a local minimum is greater than  X  , xy is more likely to be separated despite its md value. To reflect this kind of tendency, we increase the md values at local maxima by a constant s , and decrease the md values at local minima by s .
 3.2 Improved Statistical Model For bigrams with a smaller number of occurrences, the statistical measure of mu-tual information ( mi ) is not reliable. We define a weight for mutual information, i.e. where f ( x,y ) is the frequency of bigram xy in the corpus.
 occur only in several adjacent paragraphs or chapters. This rendered the mutual information of these words low, resulting in these words to be judged as separate . content-bearing word [24, 25]. We define a bigram recurrence to measure this tendency. Define bigram recurrence as where l is length of context chosen; and f l is the frequency of bigram xy in context window of length l .
 If A ( x,y ) is greater than a threshold  X  , xy is judged as combined ; otherwise, it is judged as separated . We call this function as the A feature. A feature com-bined global measurements such as mi , as well as local measurement br which is dependent on contexts.
 Five Emperors, Records of the Great Historian ( 5  X  P # 2 V 6 ). These values are chosen as exploited in this improved model. 3.3 Structural Words Optimization In Classical Chinese, some structural words seldom form words with other char-acters. These characters are judged as single-character words directly in our model. Structural words chosen in this paper includes the following characters: . ,  X  , q ,  X  set above, the values A ( x,y ) and A ( y,z ) are all set to be below the threshold value  X  so that bigram xy and yz are both judged as separated . Zhu et al. developed a human-computer interactive learning word segmentation algorithm using Kalman filters [11]. This model is equipped with a Kalman filter to make it learn and estimate user intentions from the interventions (which may contain noise) for each bigram. The linguistic knowledge is gradually accumulat-ed from the process of user interactions, and eventually, a segmentation result that fully matches the need of the user (or with an accurate rate of 100% by manual judgement) is returned within limited times of interventions. A basic assumption is that each bigram (of different characters) is independent, i.e., if the state of one bigram is modified, states of other bigrams are not affected. specific bigram xy . 4.1 Process State A time step is defined as a manual judgement to the segmentation result of can also be mapped to a time series process. Given a bigram xy , we assume the statistical measure A in the corpus follows a stable Gaussian distribution N (  X , X  2 ), where  X  and  X  2 are the expectation and variance of A respectively. We define x t is the system state of the the A feature of a specific bigram at time t . the state of time t + 1 is estimated upon time t : where w t represents the uncertainty (i.e. noise) of this prediction at time t which follows a normal distribution. This distribution is formulated as where Q t is the autocovariance of the bigram at time t . It can be calculated as where where P t represents the estimation of the state variance at time t . 4.2 Measurements and States Update Since the system is human-computer interactive, a measurement system that maps manual judgements to a continuous space of A feature is introduced. Ap-parently, some uncertainty (i.e. observation noise) is inevitable, and we assume that it follows a normal distribution. To guarantee that the mapped values corre-sponds to the manual judgments, we take a high confidence interval (for example 99%). The system measurements z t of the true state x t is assumed to be gener-ated according to where v t is the uncertainty of observations which is assumed to be a Gaussian white noise R t . After the observation, The Kalman filter will update the predic-tion of next state using a Kalman gain [22]: and the updated state variance is estimated as Then, this updated state can be used to segment next time this bigram appears in the corpus. In our practical system 1 , the user first load the raw corpus into the system. The elaborated in Section 3. The interface of the system after loading the raw corpus is shown in Figure 1.
 by a click on the symbol between the two characters of a bigram. Modified bigrams will be marked with a different color. These clicks act as user input to the system. When the user flips to the next page, pending user interventions will be applied to Kalman filters of these intervened bigrams. Different contexts of the current modified bigram is shown on the right panel of the interface, from which users can check the meaning of this bigram under different contexts. user made, hence it is able to produce better segmentation results as the human-computer interaction progresses. Users can save the current segmentation result and the states of the Kalman filters at any time. In this section, we conducted several experiments to evaluate our model. Firstly, we verified the improvement after introducing our new statistical model. Second-ly, we verified the effectiveness of Kalman filter model in reducing human effort. The ancient Chinese corpus used for experiments are chapters from Records of the Grand Historian ( 5  X  P 6 ) and History of Song ( 5 y  X  6 ).
 used experts to segment Annals of Xiang Yu, Records of the Grand Historian ( 5  X  P #  X   X  V 6 , abbreviated as Xiang Yu , approximately 11000 charac-ters) and a part of Annals of Taizu I, History of Song ( 5 y  X  # V 1  X  # y  X  6 , abbreviated as Taizu I , approximately 2000 characters) as test corpora. 6.1 Improved Statistical Model In this part, we verified the effectiveness of our improved statistical model with-out the Kalman filter based human-computer interaction process. Thus, our improved statistical model acts as an automatic segmenter without the human-computer interaction process. The baseline model used for comparison is the model by Sun et al. [15].

 formed Sun X  X  model because Sun X  X  model is more suitable to handle contem-porary Chinese texts, while our model is optimized on ancient Chinese texts. Our model achieved an improvement of more than 30% in segmentation preci-sion; and achieved an improvement of about 13%  X  14% in terms of accuracy of segmentation.
 Historian ( 5  X  P 6 ), Xiang Yu is a homogeneous corpus, while Taizu I is a heterogeneous corpus. On homogeneous text such as Xiang Yu , our model yields heterogeneous text Taizu I , a text written more than 1000 years after Records of the Grand Historian ( 5  X  P 6 ) is completed, the result was still acceptable. 6.2 Kalman Filter Model In this part, we simulated the human-computer interaction by using the correct segmentation text as input to the model so as to evaluate the performance of the Kalman filter model. We adopted the binary prediction rate (BPR) described by Zhu et al. [11] to quantify the conformity of the prediction in the model with user intention, in Section 6.1, i.e. our improved statistical model without the human-computer Kalman filter integrated approach discussed in Section 4 (abbreviated as Kalman approach ).
 as the previous section.
 Xiang Yu , Kalman filter based human-computer interactive model outperformed the baseline statistical value by about 1.6%. On Taizu I , the improvement was insignificant because the text is rather short (approximately 2000 characters). Previous research showed that Kalman filter based human-computer interaction Chinese word segmentation algorithm achieves an encouraging effect in reducing user interventions. This paper designs an improved statistical model for ancient Chinese texts, and integrates it to the Kalman filter based framework, resulting in a practical system. Experiments revealed that our improved statistical model significantly outperforms the baseline model, and the Kalman filter approach achieves an notable improvement in reducing human efforts.
