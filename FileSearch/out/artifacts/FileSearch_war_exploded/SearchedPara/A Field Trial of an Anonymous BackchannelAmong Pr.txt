 Backchannels are tools that allow participants to discuss during a performance, such as lecture or presentation, without interrupting it. They are used in higher education and conferences to facili-tate audience participation. This study examines backchannels in a Finnish primary school with a class of 12 X 13-year-old pupils. Backchannels can allow anonymous participation and this feature has been found practical in higher education. In this study, we ob-served that primary school pupils posted relevant messages at the same level as reported prior studies conducted in higher education. The pupils also appreciated the anonymity as it provided additional safety for self-expression.

Backchannels are computer-mediated communication (CMC) sys-tems, which allow real-time discussion during performances such as presentations or lectures. Backchannels have been widely used in conferences [8, 12] and have been found useful: benefits of these systems include the activation of the audience to follow the perfor-mance and to contribute to it [6], the possibility to ask questions [8, 12] and the support provided to coordinate activities [12]. How-ever, these studies rarely touch upon the design of the backchannel in use.

One interesting feature of CMC is that it can allow anonymous participation (anonymity), which can also be achieved in backchan-nels. Previous studies suggest that anonymous backchannels can encourage shy people to participate in classroom activities [2, 5] and provide safety when presenting feedback [9]. These studies were conducted at the university level, whereas our study examines primary school students ( n =22 , age 12 X 13 years old). This un-derstudied group of young pupils is especially interesting, as the range of activities and level of skills increase significantly around this age [11].

Our research problem concerns the design of backchannels for primary education: what are the impact of an anonymous backchan-nel in this age group? To answer this questions, we conducted a one-month field trial to examine how pupils use such backchan-nel. During the field trial, pupils were given the opportunity to dis-cuss in their classes using the backchannel system. We argue the anonymous mode of communication did not decrease the educa-tional quality of the discussion: non-relevant discussions emerged at about the same level to documented backchannel studies at uni-versities. Secondly, our findings indicate that pupils perceived anonymity positively and suggest that anonymity provided additional support.
Backchannels have been previously experimented in tertiary ed-ucation, i.e. universities and colleges. Previous case studies have highlighted positive effects linked with the use of backchannels. First, group cohesion and interaction has increased [5] and students were more active participants in the classroom activities [6]. Fur-thermore, results have highlighted that backchannels create more balanced discussion spaces, as students who are not participating orally use the backchannel tool to express their points [7, 4]. Last, students are more comfortable asking questions and clarifications via backchannels [2].

In terms of pedagogy, backchannels can align with the construc-tivist approach. In this approach, the students themselves create new knowledge and peer-to-peer learning takes place. Therefore, the teacher X  X  style of teaching impacts both the use and the utility of these systems [16]. Similarly audience response systems used to engage pupils in the teacher-driven approach and, for these purposes, often limit the interaction to voting only. So, even while both tools are part of the same ideal of a networked classroom [14], they approach it from different perspectives. Anonymity is often assumed to lead to negative outcomes in CMC. In a classic study Kilner et al. [10] studied professional online forum and reported that disabling anonymous discussion decreased the level of non-constructive comments by 89 %, even while the decrease in page views was only 10 %. Laboratory-based studies of co-located synchronous group communication do not ex-
Research literature explores audience response systems X  (ARS) utility, including anonymity (e.g. [14]). We do not engage with this literature as backchannels and ARS are different tools. actly answer this, even though they do compare anonymous and named modes of communication. They highlight that anonymous discussion is more susceptible to the influence of priming and de-velopment of norms [13] and group polarisation [15].

This said, we need to highlight that in a co-located chat environ-ment, anonymity  X  in the sense traditional CMC studies highlight it  X  does not exist, especially if the group is small. The participants know each others, and these groups may have existing social norms or ties in place. In this work when using the term anonymity, we mean that the system did not provide identity cues, such as an user-name, a pseudonymous nick or system level coding of messages. However, language characteristics etc. human factors might iden-tify each contributor, as there was a limited group of pupils taking part into these discussions.

Furthermore, even while previous CMC studies on anonymity are more negative, for education technology anonymity is often considered beneficial. Suggested benefits are related to the lower threshold for responding or commenting [2, 3] and more critical approach to comments when needed [9]. At the same time, notes on the disadvantages have been made, such as embarrassing re-marks that the anonymity allows [5]. Interviews with students have provided a mixed outcome: students are aware of the negative out-comes, but may also have a preference towards anonymity [3, 4].
This study was conducted as a one-month field trial with 22 pupils who were in the final grade of elementary school in the Finnish school system (i.e, 12 X 13 years old). The school was an ordinary Finnish elementary school located in central Finland, and the backchannel was available for the class to use freely. The topics under discussion were chosen by the teacher so that they supported the curriculum goals; the topic was indicated as a title viewed in the student display.

It was used to discuss, for instance, puberty (biology), energy consumption and renewable energy (natural sciences) and a nov-elist X  X  visit (mother tongue). All these topics are related to the curriculum 2 for this age group and part of their ordinary school work. Based on students X  interviews, introducing the backchannel increased amount of class discussion: traditionally they had used more exercise book-driven approach with this teacher. The teacher also noted increased activity in the classroom.

Recarding the type of anonymity, we must remind that students were co-located and the social ties in the group already existed. Therefore, when speaking of anonymity we need to acknowledge that anomymity was only partial, as explained above. However, each student had their own school desk in the classroom with space around it to allow moving. Furthermore the system was used with a smart phone, either students X  own or one loaned from the research team. As these devices could be used not only for backchannel commenting, but also for other activities, one could not be identi-fied for using the backchannel only. We therefore conclude that the use in the classroom was rather private and this way anonymity was enhanced.

The studied backchannel was developed in-house and allows par-ticipants to comment and respond to other participants X  comments. Figure 1 presents the participant X  X  view. As can be seen, the re-sponses were visualized as conversation threads and it was possible to respond to each thread separately; also, the topic of discussion is
In Finland generic descriptions of the curriculum are presented at the national level, but each teacher teaches the curriculum indepen-dently. Furthermore, standardised tests are not used for evaluation of either pupils or teachers.
 Figure 1: Pupils X  user interface to the backchannel on a mobile phone shown. There was also a public display attached to the backchan-nel, which can be used by the teacher to display the conversations to the class.

As discussed above, the system used full anonymity and the user-facing interaction had no names attached in it. However, for re-search purposes, more detailed identifiers were collected per user. Necessary parental consents were collected for all participants. No rewards were given to the pupils for participation. As said above, the pupils were allowed to either use their own smart phone or a smartphone provided by the researcher to access the backchannel. The backchannel was accessed using a web browser from a spe-sific URL, which started the HTML5 application. The application updated new content automatically, so no user interaction to show updates and new content. However the application needed to be open to to receive updates, i.e. the system did not send notifica-tions to users currently not connected. Those users however saw these messages when they visited the application again, i.e. history of the currently visible discussions was always provided.
The data collected consists of the logs of the chat, a survey and interviews. The backchannel discussions took place in Finnish; they have been translated to English in this work. The survey and interviews were conducted at the end of the field trial and exam-ined the experiences of the participants. The semi-structured in-terviews were circa five minutes each, focusing on the use ( How would you describe what you X  X e done to your uncle? Did you re-spond to other people X  X  comments? ), benefits and problems ( Has it been useful during the class? How could you improve the sys-tem? ) of the backchannel. Questions regarding anonymity were explicitly asked in the interview if not brought up by the intervie-wee ( How did you feel about the anonymity? ). These interviews were conducted individually with each pupil.
The pupils were active users of the participation system: a total of 1,205 messages were sent during the period of the pilot. The level of participation was skewed: on average, each participant sent 41.6 messages ( SD =38 . 8 ), ranging from 1 to 157 messages. This kind of distribution has also been observed in other studies [6].
We present the results in three sections: first by observing the message relevance and then survey results on pupils X  experiences and finally interview results regarding anonymity.
Using a similar approach to the previous studies [6, 2], the mes-sages were categorized into three categories: related content, unre-lated content and duplicated content 3 . The definition of unrelated content is not obvious: messages may serve a special function even with a low informational value; for example for humour value [8] or by sharing emotions. Previous studies have defined unrelated con-tent as irrelevant or inappropriate [6] or as messages that distracted the students from following the lecture [2].

We take a similar position and classify a message as unrelated if the message is irrelevant to the educational content and distracts from the discussion. This perspective follows the intended use of the backchannel tool to support educational interactions. To illus-trate this classification, in the example below lines 6 and 5 coded as unrelated, where as line 4 is duplicated content.
However, short contributing responses such as those on lines 10 X  12 were considered relevant content. These short messages are methods used to convey emotions and responses and, therefore, vital part of the dialogue, here exploring how puberty affects the pupils. However, there was a discussion thread presenting a total of 43 emoticons. This message thread, even while serving, likely humorous value, was considered unrelated content as there was no explicit educational content in this thread.
Lines 14 X 22 demonstrate a relevant discussion focused on en-ergy forms. We can see that the thread X  X  initial statement is fol-lowed by discussion where other participants explore the topic more and present their points of view.
Separating this category is sensible, as these may be due to user interface errors such as users pressing the send button several times by accident.
Otherwise serving a humorous value, this same phrase was re-peated in the discussions total of 15 times, therefore making it spam.

We observed that related content was the largest category with 70.4 % of the messages, followed by unrelated content (25.7 %) and duplicated content (3.9 %). These numbers are in similar mag-nitude to those observed in the previous research conducted with university students 5 . We conclude that the primary school students were able to use the backchannel tool to dicuss topics as efficiently as university students.
We are interested not only in the observed quality of the discus-sion examined above but also in the subjective experience of the participants [1]. The survey examined how people perceived the backchannel and its hostility, respectfulness and utility using a 1 to 5 Likert scale. The results in Figure 2 demonstrate positive experi-ence with the system.

First, regarding bullying and harassment, no student fully agreed with this statement and only 2 participants somewhat agreed with this statement. Second, majority agreed on the statement that other participants were respectful and the minority was neutral. These findings supports the design choice of anonymity, even for primary school students.

Furthermore, a majority (over 50 %) of the participants appre-ciated the comments provided and considered them beneficial for learning. They also believed that this discussion tool had an impact on both other pupils X  (over 50 % agree) and teacher X  X  actions (over 75 % agree). The following quote from the teacher supports this observation:
As we discussed, the definition of unrelated content varies from study to study, and therefore the comparison between previous studies is indicator. To illustrate, [6] reported that unrelated con-tent constituted 19 % of messages and different types of content messages 81 % of content, where as [2] reports as high as 43 % unrelated and only 57 % relevant content.
Last, this study examines the perceived utility of anonymity via interviews with the pupils. Based on the pupils X  positive reac-tions, anonymity was a good design choice; furthermore, they pre-sented this opinion several times without more detailed questions on anonymity. The reasons considering anonymity positivity were that it provided an additional layer of social security when present-ing ones X  opinions. This includes both the fear of bullying due to opinions but also the feeling of freedom of expression, both in terms of prejudice and by forcing everyone to state their opinion. The following extracts demonstrate the pupils X  experiences in de-tail.

The fear of being bullied due to other pupils knowing your opin-ions was a common topic in the interviews. It is not clear how significant problem this is in practice in this classroom: the re-sponse of Boy 3 indicates this might be a problem for the class-room, whereas Girl 1 explicitly states that this does not take place. However the explicit nature of the fear and its reasons is not the focus in this work. Rather, we are interested in the students de-creased feeling of fear as a beneficial outcome in the uptake of an backchannel system.

However, benefits of the anonymity extend to social aspects and interactions in the classroom. Boy 6 highlights how anonymity reduced importance of ones X  persona in the discussion, allowing participants to present different aspects without damage to existing social settings. This thinking was also exteded by Girl 3, who sug-gesst that anonymity required everyone to consider the topic, again as social support in the system was limited.

However, the anonymity was not only experienced positively, there were also a few neutral tones  X  no negative comments were brought up. However, pupils observed that anoymity created a trade-off with social support, as explained by Boy 5:
We conducted a field deployment of a backchannel in a rather un-derstudied group of primary school pupils. Pupils in this age group are in a pivotal developmental stage of identity forming and prac-tices of online communications are still developing. Nevertheless, we report similar use patterns to those studies conducted in higher education, especially regarding the efficiency of use. Furthermore, the pupils and the teacher perceived the backchannel tool as a useful tool for learning. Based on these results, a free-form backchannel can be used in elementary schools.

We made an intentional choice to use an anonymous backchan-nel. This choice might have lead to antisocial behavior as in other studies of computer mediated communication. However pupils did not report these nor did we observe such behavior. Instead the pupils X  interviews highlighted that anonymity provided an addi-tional layer of security in the social group, and therefore enhaced the use of backchannel  X  a result also suggested in the previous research on backchannels [2, 5].

Based on these observations, we conclude that these results sup-port the use of anonymous backchannels in this elementary school context. Pupils experiences however presented the nececcarly trade-off between anonymous participation and social support provided when discussing in a system with identities displayed. One of the contextual factors potentially influencing the outcome was that stu-dents knew each others already before the deployment of the sys-tem. This also highlighted the trade-off and outcomes experienced here; in other context the need for social support layer might not be as urging as those noted in these interviews.

Furthermore, contextual factors in this include the fact that pupils were co-present in the use and the use took place in an institution where a code of conduct existed and was enforced by the teacher. This is a major difference compared with the classical anonymity studies in online forums and with backchannel studies focusing on conferences or other kind of temporal settings. One challenge in understanding these contextual factors is difficulty to conduct com-parative studies; for example the analysis framework used in this study is the least common nominator from existing studies and we acknowledge that more interpative framework might provide addi-tional insight into the activities pupils engaged.

Future research can apply quasi-experimental setups to study de-tails of different choices and draw potential differences caused by the co-located use and social interaction, which are not required by the classical computer-mediated communication. Also, questions focusing on the educational impact of backchannel tools should be further examined to support the wider uptake of these tools.
