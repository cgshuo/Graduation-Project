 Open Innovation has become an important new paradigm for incorporating external knowledge and sources in the in-novation process of organizations. Besides other discussed arguments the resulting large size of innovator networks sug-gests that algorithmic approaches for team recommendation may be needed in that scenario. The current work identifies the related difficulties and thoroughly investigates aspects entities for the problem of team recommendation. Based on that, we develop a meta model which allows to instantiate and integrate most of the vast number of the existing socio-/psychological models on optimal team composition. This meta model is necessary for operationalizing our intended team recommendation approach.

While the traditional function of a team was to bun-dle physical power to accomplish a task, in modern society teams start to be crucial also for mental tasks such as de-cision making, research or the development of innovations. According to Schumpeter X  X  theory an innovation  X  X onsists to a substantial extent of a recombination of conceptual and physical materials that were previously in existence X  [20]. Thus, teams with their different sources of knowledge rep-resent an effective source of innovation. Nevertheless, the composition of effective teams for a given task is not easy. Personal managers or project leaders require much experi-ence and knowledge about personnel X  X  characteristics, task, available persons and environment in order to compose ef-fective teams. The acquisition and application of this know-ledge is rather difficult, especially in large environments (i.e. environments with a high number of possible teams, com-plex tasks, etc.). An example for this kind of environments are Open Innovation Networks .
According to Chesbrough [3],  X  X pen innovation [short OI] is the use of purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge to accelerate internal innovation, and expand the markets for external use of innovation, respectively. [This paradigm] assumes that firms can and should use external ideas as well as internal ideas, and internal and external paths to market, as they look to advance their technology. X 
Related work has investigated how and when OI outper-forms Closed Innovation (e.g. [11]) and shown that OI is indeed a very promising paradigm. OI can result in a cross-and inter-organizational network-like structure of contacts, relations, and collaborations: the OI network. Possible ac-tors are e.g. freelancers, customers, companies, company employees, company-substructures or other organizations.
In order to support the usefulness of algorithmic team rec-ommendation in the context of OI, a number of arguments can be asserted. First of all, OI networks can become very large [6] because the set of candidate-actors for OI inter-action and collaboration is usually very large, since the re-striction to company boundaries does not apply. Thus in the case of OI, actors responsible for assembling a team usually can not know all other actors from the network personally and could profit from an algorithmic approach.

Aside from the specific case of OI, a number of general arguments for the usefulness of algorithmic team recommen-dation exist: avoiding of prejudices towards specific people when assembling the team, taking more aspects into con-sideration in parallel than a human being, taking into con-sideration more systematically past experiences and  X  X eav-ing well-trodden paths X  by e.g. mixing teams across organi-zational boundaries or established team boundaries, which may increase information flow in the whole network.
Little research on actual algorithmic team composition ex-ists (e.g. [4],[2]). More is known from social sciences or psy-chology. Most existing approaches from these fields describe configurations of influence factors (variables) and outputs of team processes (e.g. result quality) and their dependencies in an informal way and propose informal guidelines for good  X  X eam composition X ,  X  X eam effectiveness X  or  X  X eam perfor-mance X  X 9][15][23]. Most practical  X  X olutions X  to the problem consist of best practices based on some of these theories and mostly on personal experience which is hard to explicate. Except from these theoretical approaches also best practices of project managers, HR-personnel etc. have been applied and can be regarded as implicit models.

A major challenge in view of solving the general prob-lem of algorithmic team composition (or algorithmic team recommendation respectively) lies in the identification and classification of all key components (e.g. involved variables, dependencies etc.). Effectively the challenge lies in the de-sign of a meta model for all such problem components or aspect entities. This meta model is the basis for the design and implementation of an efficient algorithm producing high quality team recommendations, working on concrete models as instantiations of a user-configurable meta model.
What makes a precise, algorithmically processable mod-eling of the problem so difficult is the large number of vari-ables, constraints and dependencies involved, which are ex-tremely heterogeneous in nature so that team comparison only is not sufficient. We will refer to this influencing vari-ables as team external variables (section 3.4). Last but not least it is hard to determine a suitable problem class for the problem of algorithmic team recommendation as such. The problem has characteristics of database problems, constraint solving approaches, case based reasoning, (content based) recommender systems, information retrieval, statistics etc.
Nevertheless, the aforementioned meta model is a good starting point and should allow instantiating existing and future approaches in an operationalizable way.
Collecting aspect entities for the team composition prob-lem from previous work is a good first step towards such a meta model. Classes of aspect entities that have been inves-tigated can be designated as team member variables, entities formalizing output/outcome, team intermediate variables, team external variables, dependencies, and constraints.
The class of team member variables encompasses all vari-ables strictly related to individual team members.
Functional Knowledge: Individuals can be character-ized according to their functional knowledge (e.g. skills) and this can then be matched e.g. to task specifications.
Demographic Variables: Every possible team member has individual profile properties that describe her by means of age, gender, nationality, language etc. Studies showed that they influence team performance [18].

Social Network Variables: The social network has a great influence on team performance [8][16] while the kind of influence is dependent on the specific problem instance.
Psychological Variables: Current work on team com-position shows that psychological effects such as motivation [23], personality type compatibility [17] and goal congruence can have a great influence on the result of group processes.
In most of the cases a central goal is to recommend teams with respect to maximal (predicted) performance. Perfor-mance may e.g. correspond to a high quality of proposed solutions, quantity of ideas generated in a brainstorming session, general satisfaction among team members [5] or the time needed to develop a solution.

Nominal Performance: A wealth of nominal perfor-mance indicators is described by business science and in-clude net revenue created by the team, the time it took the team to develop the solution, customers X  satisfaction or team leader X  X  evaluations.

Social Performance: Work in teams produces not only nominal outcomes but also has social effects like satisfaction or build up or changes in trust (which can however influ-ence nominal preference). Examples for social performance indicators are acceptance and agreement, investigated in a study on influence of communication environment on these two variables where their importance is emphasized[14].
Socio-/psychological models include in the most cases in-termediate variables as well. Such variables are dependent on more fundamental  X  X rior X  variables and have indirect in-fluence on the output/outcome of a team.

Conflicts: Nature, numbers or characteristics of arising conflicts in a team are typical intermediate variables. They often depend on other more fundamental variables such as psychological team member variables. In [18] substantive conflicts (which are said to increase task performance) and affective conflicts (which increase turnover) are discussed.
Group Longevity: Group longevity (also called group tenure) measures how often and how long a team performed together. This may have influence on the amplitude of ef-fects such as conflicts etc. and hence on outputs (e.g. [18]).
Group Synergy: Synergy can be defined as the differ-ence of capabilities of a team compared to the sum of the capabilities of all the team members separately. Synergy al-lows teams to outperform merely nominal teams and thus may have substantial impact on team performance [9].
Team external variables (TEV) define the environment and the context of a team X  X  problem solving process. In con-trast to team member variables these variables can not be derived and acquired from individuals but have to be mod-eled and acquired from a whole team X  X  context/environment .
The team recommendation domain includes a very large amount of external variables. As a matter of fact most socio-/psychological works on team design discuss and underline the importance of team external variables in both, general (e.g. [9]) and detailed way (i.e. on single variables, e.g. [5]). Their acquisition, operationalization and comparison is probably one of the main aspects that makes team recom-mendation hard to solve algorithmically. In the following, some examples of TEV will be introduced.

Task-related TEV: Defining tasks can be done on sev-eral dimensions: by defining the resource pool (e.g. skills, materials, etc.) needed for the task, the task class (such as doing things , making decisions and creating, adapting and inventing [15] or research ), task urgency, task importance or task structure (parallelizable, partitionable, etc.)[24].
Organization: If an organization is not used to radical innovations, people may be used to (involuntarily or volun-tarily) reduce their own ideation space because their orga-nizations tend to prefer less risky and less creative ideas. In addition this category comprises also whether organizations are national or international or if the working atmosphere in the organization is rather informal or not.

Team Organization: The structure and organization of a team influences team performance[9]. Thus, type of the team (e.g. real or nominal team [21]) or type of team man-agement (manager-led, self-managing or self-designing) have to be specified. Also depending on the location of possible team members the team may be set up also as virtual team.
Reward System: The type and presence of reward sys-tem is crucial for motivating team members to participate actively. Some reward systems can be based on soft rewards (e.g. reputation) and some on explicit rewards (e.g. money) [10]. Hybrid solutions are also possible.

Information System: Depending on the quality of the information system, a team may be able to find or not find the information necessary to accomplish its task. The infor-mation system should also support the team in choosing the best strategies for their work (e.g. by giving feedback)[9]. Teams which have such feedback systems can possibly cor-rect their problem solving strategy and direction if necessary and hence increase the quality of their results (e.g. [13]).
Process: Process variables describe the process proper-ties such as the conflict solving approaches, group norms, etc. which the team has to adopt. Apart from that, this cat-egory may contain general information about process struc-ture and problem solving approach such as the type of used creativity technique [7], decision making technique (e.g. [19]) or software development methodology.

Communication System: Depending on the type of team desired, task etc. the type of communication system has an influence on the team[22]. Virtual teams may have to use an IT infrastructure to communicate (e.g. chat, video conferences, email, etc.) [14].
Dependencies describe the interrelations between the team member variables and output/outcome. We identified two aspects in the use of dependency variables: First aspect is the description of a specific property of a set of team mem-ber variables (whether e.g. it is variety, the sum or a specific combination). Second aspect indicates whether this prop-erty is positively or negatively related with the specific out-put/outcome discussed. In the following we will describe the categories related to the first aspect while the second aspect is addressed extensively by positive or negative correlations in the literature (e.g. [18]).

Homogeneity/Heterogeneity: The concepts of hetero-geneity (or diversity) and homogeneity are used with am-biguous results (e.g. [18][1]). One reason for that lies in the use of the term heterogeneity or diversity itself. Har-rison and Klein present in their work [12] three different categories of  X  X iversity X  (variety, separation, disparity) and show examples where diversity has been used with different meanings with different results.

Matching: A matching function is often used to match specific properties of team members to a giving specification. A typical example could be the matching of desired and actual skills for a given task.

Ideal Combination: In the psychological domain some-times specific combinations of variable values are proposed as desirable. The study [17] on optimal personality types, mentioned in section 3.1, is a typical example for that.
Sum: Interval scaled team member variables can also be aggregated in several ways in order to be minimized or max-imized in combination. One example could be the sum of the tenure of team members.
Team composition is heavily dependent on constraints such as desired vs. current location of team members, work-load, availability, budget etc. and can be seen as a pre-filter for the recommendation.

Time &amp; Location: Time constraints are typical con-straints for the team composition problem. Attention has to be paid in distinguishing team external variables such as available time for a project from the constraint that specifies absolute time intervals. Additionally for traditional teams location availability or capacity constraints may also apply.
Organization: For OI networks consisting of companies and/or organizations, sometimes also bureaucratic or legal matters play a role such as that only freelancers or certain specific organizations should exclusively be considered for the team recommendation.
As we have seen, many models (implicit and explicit) exist, that have different criteria on which they are eval-uated. Therefore a universal team composition system must be capable of using/instantiating/integrating several differ-ent models, depending on the task, the environment, project leader X  X  past experience with team recommendation etc. Our review in the precedent sections shows that the team compo-sition problem consists of several components. These com-ponents are used in our developed meta model consisting of team member variables (input space), output/outcome variables (output space), dependencies (mapping input to output), team external variables (influencing the team from outside) and constraints that have to be satisfied before a team is composed according to a model (i.e. before applying the recommendation algorithm). Due to space restrictions we will not describe this meta model in great detail here but will do so in future work. We will now briefly discuss the main parts.

While the use of input space and output space is rather well described in the socio-psychological literature, the oper-ationalization and appropriate use of dependencies and team external variables need a more accurate analysis.

As mentioned in section 3.5, dependencies consist of two parts: a mapping of a set of team member variables with respect to a specific property (e.g. variety of nationalities), and a mapping that describes its influence on a specific out-put. We model this two parts as two functions called analytic mapping and heuristic mapping .

Team external variables are probably the most complex part of the model. Their interpretation may vary depend-ing on the recommendation approach applied. E.g. Team external variables represent the context or situation of our recommendation and hence could be used as the context dimension for context-aware recommendation algorithms.
In this paper we presented first steps toward a meta model that can be used for team recommendation in OI networks. We first motivated why a team recommendation system can support people when composing teams in large innovator networks. We then discussed challenges related to the de-sign and implementation of team recommendation. In the main part, we reviewed previous work in the field of so-cial sciences and identified variable categories according to it that can be later used for specifying a meta model for team recommendations.

Our future work consists in further developing formaliza-tion and embedding of the identified components in order to build the desired meta model. The approach uses con-straints for pre-filtering possible teams and uses team ex-ternal variables in our recommender system as an analogon to context in context-aware recommender systems. We aim at evaluating our meta model by instantiating different best practice models in an OI network and by applying a recom-mendation algorithm which can consider all the entities of our meta model in an appropriate way.
