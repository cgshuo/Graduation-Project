 1. Introduction
Jansen and Pooch (2000) describe marketing reports stating that web search is the most important Internet activity to users and that one in 28 web pages viewed is a search results page. It is not hard to imagine that the abundance of these interactions may have grown today, together with the increase in material on the web.
Because of the inherent value of information discovery, new insights and improvements to Internet search design will have a tremendous impact.

To improve search engine effectiveness, we have observed an increased interest in gathering additional feed-back about users  X  information needs that goes beyond the queries they type in. Adaptive search engines use implicit and explicit feedback indicators to model users ( Joachims, 2002; Holland, Ester, &amp; Kie X ling, 2003 ) or to model search tasks, such as those studies presented in the TREC competition ( Kang &amp; Kim, 2004; Baeza &amp; Ribeiro, 1999 ). To create appropriate models, it is essential to understand users  X  search behaviors.
Earlier work has made great strides in understanding the use of search engines, analyzing the log files of popular search sites including AltaVista ( Silverstein, Henzinger, Marais, &amp; Moricz, 1998 ), Excite ( Jansen &amp;
Pooch, 2000 ), and also search engines in Europe ( Jansen &amp; Spink, 2005 ). These studies reported many descrip-tive statistics about users  X  search queries. Looking beyond search engine logs, Granka, Joachims, and Gay (2004) reported initial eye fixation statistics from searches on Google. Recent work by Kloeckner, Wirschum, and Jameson (2004) revealed both breadth-first and depth-first sequence patterns on Google. Depth-first searches in this context refer to searches in which a user visits the page of an abstract on the Google result list before reading the next abstract. Breadth-first patterns occur when a user reads each abstract in the Google result page before visiting the page(s) of interest. Prior to the existence of web search, but perhaps similar in part, MacGregor, Lee, and Lam (1986) discovered specific search patterns on menus, which they named ter-minating, exhaustive and redundant. These prior studies, however, did not address search behavior variability due to the kind of web search task. We wish to not only uncover search strategies but also determine how they vary under different conditions.

To understand the different uses of search engines, Broder (2002) developed a web search taxonomy that classifies the  X  X  X eed behind the query X  X  into three classes: navigational tasks are tasks where the user  X  s intent is to find a particular web page, such as a homepage; informational tasks arise when the intent is to find infor-mation about a topic that may reside on one or more web pages; and transactional search tasks reflect the desire of the user to perform an action, such as an online purchase. Broder  X  s taxonomy has been widely adopted, as in the work by Kang and Kim (2004) , which showed that optimizing search engines based on implicit data about informational vs. navigational search improved performance. His taxonomy was re-eval-uated by Rose and Levinson (2004) , resulting in rather similar findings regarding the breakdown of these tasks. Broder reported 48% of web queries as informational, and 20% and 30% of queries as navigational and transactional respectively, while Rose and Levinson reported 60% informational, with roughly 14% and 25% navigational and transactional.

While these classifications help explain the different kinds of web search tasks, it remains to be understood if and how these tasks differ cognitively, and if they elicit different information seeking strategies. A strong understanding of the determinants of Internet search strategies and the appropriateness of interface designs is increasingly vital given the saturation of digital information available. This research analyzes users  X  eye movement sequence patterns during interaction with Google, and considers how these behaviors are influ-enced by gender and by task classification. For example, how does effort spent reading abstracts compare with selection behaviors, and how does the effort vary with respect to user and task? Or, can we safely assume that when a user clicks on the n th abstract, that she is making an informed decision based on n 1 abstracts pre-ceding it? We present results from our eye tracking study to address these and related questions. Earlier studies have examined the effect of gender on information-seeking behavior on the web. Large,
Beheshti, and Rahman (2002) and Roy and Chi (2003) have both found significant behavioral gender differ-ences in their studies. Large et al. reported on collaborative search behavior, finding teams of boys to be gen-erally more active online. Roy et al. compared behavioral patterns to learning outcomes, noting that search pattern itself was a strong determinant of learning gains. We utilize gender as one classification of users, so that we may compare its influence on web search behavior against task-specific influences.

Our work extends earlier work in two ways. First, we describe how users evaluate the results returned to them in response to Google queries. Examining this search within the search results promotes a richer under-standing of the process of information seeking ( Fidel, 1987 ). Second, we compare behavior variability amongst users and amongst search tasks, in an effort to understand how user differences and task differences influence search behavior. We use gender to classify users and Broder  X  s (2002) informational and navigational task clas-ses to classify tasks. This extension allows us to report on the effectiveness and implications of identifying user groups and tasks kinds through behavioral data, applicable when designing customized or adaptive search engines.

In order to better capture the information seeking process, we use eye tracking to supplement traditional log file analysis. For example, if a user selects a page from a list of ranked query results, the click and rank is recorded in a log file, but without also capturing what has been viewed, one cannot report that the user found the earlier abstracts to be inferior. It can help us to understand if the search result page interface design is optimal, and for which uses. Eye tracking has been used in many domains to capture visual cognition as well as user interaction behavior with computers ( Rayner, 1998; Jacob &amp; Karn, 2003 ).

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. We describe the details of our experiment and our scanpath analysis methods in Sections 2 and 3 respectively. Our results in terms of both overall behavioral indices and also gender and task variations are included in Section 4 . We conclude with a summarization and implications of our findings in Section 5 . 2. Eye tracking study
Thirty-six undergraduate subjects at a large university in the northeast US were recruited for this study. We obtained complete eye tracking data of 23 subjects because of inability of some subjects to be calibrated and additional equipment and setup errors. In total there were 14 males and 9 females. While a smaller sample, this sample remained representative and was subject to thorough analysis (more than 400 queries and 600 Google results pages were studied). The subjects were from several different disciplines including engineering, commu-nication, life sciences, and humanities with an age range from 18 to 23 and were well experienced with the
Google search engine, as reported in our survey. For instance, on a scale of 1 X 10, subjects reported their exper-tise with Google to be 8.8 on average, with only two subjects (one male and one female) reporting expertise of less than 7.
 The five navigational and five informational questions shown in Table 1 were administered to all subjects.
All of these questions are closed questions (as opposed to open ended) allowing us to measure success explic-itly. Before selecting the specific search tasks to be used in this study, tasks were crosschecked with the top searches listed on the  X  X  X oogle Zeitgeist X  X  ( www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html ). The purpose of this was to ensure that the tasks were representative of the various genres of searches that the general population uses on a regular basis, including travel, movies, current events, celebrities, and local issues. The tasks were also pre-tested to ensure that the most intuitive queries would not always result in top-ranked results, and that hence a mixed level of difficulty was targeted across the search tasks. Each subject was surveyed on both the subject  X  s perceived difficulty and prior knowledge of each question, using a scale of 1 X 10. No correlation was found between gender and subjects  X  reported prior knowledge, or between task and prior knowledge for each question. Nor was a correlation found for gender or task with respect to perceived difficulty. For instance, the most difficult search tasks included both navigational and informational queries, and the average reported difficulty of the questions ranged between 3.06 and 8.06. Two minutes were given for answering each question. Furthermore, subjects were read the questions aloud in an effort to minimize the tendency to choose only the words in the written questions for their queries and to eliminate unnecessary eye movements away from the computer monitor that could potentially hinder the accuracy of the ocular calibration. A computer script was generated so that each subject performed the ten tasks in a completely randomized order to elim-inate unnecessary biases. Subjects were asked to search as usual and did not know what exactly we were mea-suring. Due to the size of the computer monitor, scrolling was required to view abstracts ranked 7 X 8 and higher on the Google results pages.

Both transaction log file data and eye movement data were gathered in our experiment. Eye movements of subjects were captured using the Applied Science Laboratories (ASL) 504 eye tracker. The eye tracker captures eye position and pupil dilation with a rate of 60 Hz in a natural setting. ASL  X  s Gazetracker software was run to capture the areas of interest on the Google result pages. Areas of interest for our experiment were the 10 regions representing the 10 abstracts of the ranked documents on Google result pages. Subclasses of these regions, such as titlebar, text snippet, and URL address are of interest, but cannot be captured with high accu-racy due to limitations of precision of the ASL 504 eye tracker.

We classified eye movements according to the following significant indicators of ocular behavior, namely fixations, saccades, pupil dilation, and scanpaths ( Rayner, 1998 ). A fixation is defined as a spatially stable gaze lasting for approximately 200 X 300 ms, during which visual attention is directed to a specific area of the visual display. Fixations represent the instances in which most information acquisition and processing occurs ( Ray-ner, 1998 ). Saccades are the continuous and rapid movements of eye gazes between fixation points. Because saccadic eye movements are extremely rapid, within 40 X 50 ms, very limited information processing happens during saccades. Scanpaths , or sequences of fixations, were calculated to represent the eye movements and sequential behavior.

These eye tracking metrics allow us to understand users  X  interactions to a micro-level. While there are many potential factors that may influence these behaviors, we chose to classify users according to gender and tasks according to informational and navigational tasks as described. These classifications were not only clearly sep-arable, but also served as promising examples with which to illustrate new insights and influence on behavior.
To compare differences between genders and between search tasks with we used SPSS to calculate analysis of variance (ANOVA) for various quantifiable metrics of behavior, and Chi square for categorical metrics. 3. Scanpath analysis methods
While eye tracking can provide a much richer understanding of a user  X  s information seeking strategies, the amount of data can be overwhelming and complex to reason about, particularly when studying scanpaths.
There are significant challenges to appropriately extracting scanpath trends; for example, there are multiple ways to measure similarity between two paths, each yielding different results. To help us to reason about search patterns, we define additional properties on scanpaths.

Fig. 1 depicts an example scanpath , or sequence of eye fixations, on a Google results page. For analysis purposes, we represent the scanpath in terms of the ordered sequence of Google result abstracts fixated upon by a subject. In the example above, the scanpath is thus 2 ! 2 ! 3 ! 2 ! 1 ! 1 ! 1. Next we define two abstractions of this path. We obtain the compressed sequence by aggregating subsequent fixations that remain on the same abstract into one element. Thus, the compressed sequence in the same example is 2 ! 3 ! 2 ! 1.
Though we care about time spent viewing each abstract, we are not concerned with fixation travel patterns within a particular abstract or components of the abstract because of the lack of significant precision of the eye tracker and so they are compressed. Our second abstraction of the scanpath is the minimal scanpath which is the path obtained by removing repeat visits, or regressions from the compressed sequence. In our example above, the minimal path is simply 2 ! 3 ! 1. This representation gives us an overall ordering of the abstracts viewed.

Using these scanpaths, we can better characterize a user  X  s search strategy, and in particular, their search within Google results. We introduce three additional terms to describe this search. First, we say that a scan-path preceding a web document selection (or click) is complete if the path contains all abstracts of rank n , for all n less than or equal to the rank of the selected web document. Thus the user who makes a complete scan-path does not click on a web page before viewing each of the abstracts that preceded it in the Google ranking.
Next, we define a user  X  s evaluation of the search results to be linear if the minimal sequence of the user  X  s scan-path is monotonically increasing in steps of 1 and strictly linear if the corresponding compressed sequence is monotonically increasing in steps of 1. Note that a compressed path is monotonically increasing if and only if a user makes no skips (jumps of length greater than one) and no regressions (jumps back) while viewing the abstract list. We also quantify skip and regression distance by the distance of the jumps in number of abstracts between them. 4. Results
In this section, we report on the major findings of this research. We first describe the overall web search behaviors using eye tracking methods, and second describe variations in those behaviors based on task kind and gender. 4.1. Search behaviors
To give a rich understanding of the interaction, we highlight conclusive results with respect to the search question, individual queries, and individual query result page viewings. Overall about 60% of the questions were answered correctly within the time limit allowed. Over each successfully answered question, on average 1.6 queries were entered to Google, and an average of 4.78 abstracts were clicked upon (including repeat selec-tions of abstracts).

With respect to the individual queries, 437 queries were submitted by the subjects in total. On average 0.80 web documents were selected, or clicked upon per query, and the number of clicks ranged from zero to five.
Thirty-nine percent of the queries resulted in at least one abstract selection. In 96% of the queries, subjects looked only at the first Google result page, containing only the first ten abstracts. No subjects went beyond the third results page. Most of the subjects viewed the first and second results rather equally in frequency; however, they chose to click on the first result most of the time. The results indicate that for each query only the most highly ranked search results are likely to be exposed to the users. We also observed that users rely heavily on the abstracts alone to determine the relevance of the corresponding web page. On more than half of the search sessions, users chose to revise the query terms without clicking on any abstract.

To obtain the patterns of evaluation of the abstracts on the query results pages, we calculated scanpath patterns on over 600 Google result pages. The average lengths of the scanpath, compressed scanpath, and min-imal scanpath were 16, 5.8, and 3.2 respectively. Thus subjects viewed on average only three abstracts per result page. Sixty-seven percent of sequences for which a document was selected were complete . 34% of the scanpaths were linear and 19% were strictly linear , the latter mostly attributed to sequences of lengths one and two (queries with length one are by default strictly linear). Fiftynine percent and 50% of sequences have regressions and skips, respectively. For each pair of sequential abstracts in the scanpaths, the average distance between their ranks was 1.67, calculated on over 5000 pairs of eye movements. These findings demonstrate that users do not generally follow the ranking presented by the search engine.

On those Google result pages in which a document was not selected, only 4% of the scanpaths contained all 10 abstracts. This indicates that the user in most cases quickly determines that she will reformulate a query without checking each of the returned abstracts. Not only are the latter ranked result pages rarely clicked upon, but they are also infrequently viewed. This property may suggest that fewer abstracts could better serve users  X  search behaviors. In general we find that users are looking at the first two results, but if these are not believed to be relevant, they are making skips, jumps and regressions in viewing the abstracts. During this jumping period, users often revert their gaze to reevaluate the first two abstracts again, fixating on average on about six result abstracts including repeat abstracts, or on three unique result abstracts before leaving the results page.

The overall picture shows us that subjects do few queries, and view the first few ranked abstracts primarily, and are often not reading the ranked abstracts in the order they are presented. We next consider how these general trends vary with respect to gender and task. 4.2. User and task influence Results from an ANOVA test with task kind as a factor and several dependent variables are depicted in
Table 2 . The variables listed in this table were computed per question. Later in this section we will see addi-tional variables with respect to the individual queries and results abstracts. Only variables that resulted in a significant difference in means for either gender or task kind are displayed. Variables with no significant dif-ference include: rate of success, number of queries per question, number of fixations on Google results pages, time spent on the Google results pages, number of results pages viewed, and average fixation duration. In this table, the time variables were analyzed on successfully answered questions only. Success rates were not signif-icantly different with respect to task or gender. Similar relationships between informational and navigational tasks were achieved when we evaluated these variables with respect to individual queries.

In the table,  X  X  X ercent Time on Google Result Pages X  X  gives the proportion of time spent evaluating abstracts over the overall time spent per question. This distinction was made for measuring interaction with the search engine interface alone versus interaction with web sites outside of Google. Intuitively, a greater pro-portion of time is spent on Google result pages for navigational tasks since navigational questions do not require much additional scrutiny on web documents outside of Google; once the appropriate query result is found, one immediately has the answer for the navigational query. Thus, for navigational searches, the results page is typically where the user  X  s need is met. Instead, for informational searches, the search on the respective web documents is a critical part of the search process, and the results page is only an intermediary for that web document search.

Another observed variable influenced by task type is pupil dilation on selected web documents. Pupil dila-tion has been shown to indicate arousal ( Anderson &amp; Pietrzak, 1967; Beatty, 1982 ) and the significantly greater dilation for informational searches indicates that users need to exert more cognitive efforts on the clicked or chosen query results pages. This is not surprising, but is noteworthy because it offers support that a different cognitive activity is taking place. Note however, that pupil dilation was not significantly different between task types on the Google results pages themselves; it only differed once on a selected page. This implies that the process of searching within the query results abstracts may yield similar levels of cognitive arousal for the two tasks.

Gender had almost no impact on each of the variables listed thus far. The only significant gender findings discovered per question relate to information seeking on selected web documents beyond the Google interface.
Specifically, males had greater average fixation durations on web documents than females ( p &lt; .05). Also, gen-der differences did not play a role for any of the behaviors listed above at the query level. One additional query specific variable was observed to be significantly different however; females submitted significantly longer que-ries than men, with means of 3.8 and 3.4 words respectively ( p &lt; .02).

While task type has had a much greater influence than gender on most of the interactions discussed, the reverse is the case when we consider the evaluation of Google result page abstracts. Results from ANOVA and Pearson Chi square tests using gender as a factor and several dependent scanpath properties are shown in Table 3 . The first two variables in the table are relevant only on pages where a document was selected (clicked). Only variables between which a significant difference existed are shown. Variables which were tested and showed no significant influence by gender include time durations, number of fixations, average fixation duration, average pupil dilation, length of the scanpaths, as well as fixations and clicks on the abstract num-bers that are not mentioned in the table. The percent of repeat viewings of abstracts and the linearity of the scanpath were compared only on the first viewing of the result page.

When considering the number of fixations on each of ranks 7 X 10 and also simply whether or not the abstract for that rank was gazed upon, we observe that the mean values for males are significantly higher. Likewise, males also were 5.4 times more likely to view additional Google results pages than females.
We also observe that females make more regressions, or more often return to previously visited abstracts in their scanpaths with respect to their scanpath lengths, while men  X  s scanpaths are more likely to be strictly lin-ear. Also, disregarding repeats, the overall order in which the abstracts are viewed is more linear in men  X  s scan-paths. The lengths of the paths were not significantly different, however. These findings suggest that while
Google  X  s linear presentation of results may be ideal for some strategies, others may benefit from some forms of record keeping of evaluations (such as check boxes, for example) or nonlinear presentations.

None of the above values were significantly different between informational and navigational tasks. The only significant task findings discovered were that (1) the number of abstracts viewed below the clicked rank was greater for navigational searches, and (2) fixating on rank two was more likely for informational than navigational tasks, significant at .03.

Since in many of the cases only two abstracts are viewed, simplifying the evaluation, we also looked solely at the data for which more than two abstracts were viewed, representing cases where the first two abstracts were likely not obviously the solution to the search task. For these 327 scanpaths, the results are even stronger.
That is, each of the variables noted in Table 3 remained significant and an equal or greater significance, plus additional behaviors differed between genders. Also, no significant differences were found in informational vs. navigational tests. The additional differences between genders represent the finding that males look at a greater number of abstracts and also spend more time examining the result page in general. Whether or not abstract 6 was viewed also became significantly higher for males. This is worth mentioning since it is suggestive that the greater tendency to view Abstracts 7 X 10 by males is not solely influenced by the need to scroll to see Abstracts 7 or 8 and higher. 5. Conclusion
We have presented statistics about web search activity in an effort to deepen our understanding of users  X  interactions with query result pages in the search process, and to show ways in which task and user classes can influence search behavior. Our study captures the behaviors of a sample of college students on a series of 10 closed search questions. We find that in general time and pupil dilation are influenced by whether the search task is informational or navigational and not by gender, while patterns for evaluating the query result abstracts are influenced by gender and not by task kind. Informational searches took more effort and time on average, despite no task influence found with respect to success. Males looked at abstracts further in the result list, were more linear in the order in which they viewed the abstracts, and made fewer regressions. The sensi-tivity to rank position in our results is significant to both interface designers and information retrieval researchers, particularly because search engine ranking functions can produce nearly equivalent weights for the top five or ten ranked documents.

Eye tracking methods and particularly scanpath analysis provided a level of detail unreported in previous web search studies. It is valuable to consider web search behavior on multiple levels because both macro and micro level behavioral properties are important for design. By presenting several factors of influence, and com-paring findings according to user and task types, we observe that task and gender each influence different kinds of search behaviors, with evaluation patterns more sensitive to gender and cumulative question data more sen-sitive to task. Direct implications of gender differences and their grounding in gender studies theories are beyond the scope of this work.

In the future, it would be of enriching to analyze search and evaluation behaviors in terms of information foraging theory, developed by Pirolli and Card (1999) , or other earlier information seeking models, in an effort to compare the cost, or perceived cost, of reformulating a query, the cost of clicking on an suggested document link, and the cost of gazing, or reading the abstract, over time. We also have initial findings on average sequences through the abstracts or the selected documents in an effort to put together a more comprehensive visualization of search patterns. Additionally, there has been a considerable amount of work on the design and evaluation of web search systems to incorporate both direct search and browsing activities ( Hearst et al., 2002 ). Drawing on those results and doing further eye tracking studies of alternative search systems could be fruitful.
