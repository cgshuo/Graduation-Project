 With increased adoption of social networking tools, it is be-coming more difficult to extract useful information from the mass of data generated daily by users. Curation of content and sources is an important filter in separating the signal from noise. A good set of credible sources often requires painstaking manual curation, which often yields incomplete coverage of a topic. In this demo, we present a recommender system to aid this process, improving the quality and quan-tity of sources. The system is highly-adaptable to the goals of the curator, enabling some novel uses for curating and monitoring lists of users.

Storyful 1 is a social media news agency established in 2010 with the aim of filtering newsworthy content from the vast quantities of noisy data on social networks such as Twit-ter and YouTube. To this end, Storyful invests considerable time into the manual curation of content on these networks. Twitter users can organise the users they follow into lists . Storyful maintains user lists as a means of monitoring break-ing news. These lists can be constructed manually, but this process is time-consuming, and risks incomplete coverage of all aspects of a news story. Therefore, to support these cu-ration tasks, we have developed and deployed a web-based system for exploring the Twitter network and recommend-ing the important users that form the  X  X ommunity X  around a news story (see Fig. 1). Currently the system is being used to monitor over 100 news stories, mining microblogging data for a diverse range of topics, from the United States 2012 presidential election to the political situation in Afghanistan. A video of the system in use is available online 2 .

Again the extent of the exploration during the update process can be controlled by user-defined settings. The system then iterates between recommendation and update phases (see Fig. 2).

Rather than using a single view of the network to produce recommendations, we employ a multi-view approach that produces recommendations based on different graph repre-sentations of the Twitter network surrounding a given user list, and combines them using an SVD-based aggregation approach [1]. Information from multiple views is also used to control the exploration of the Twitter network. This is an important consideration due to the limitations surround-ing Twitter data access. These network views include friend and follower graphs, mention and retweet graphs and views based on how users are sorted into lists by other users  X  effectively crowd-sourcing the list curation in part.
The system runs on open source software and can be de-ployed on a single server or an Amazon EC2 instance for example. The specific hardware requirements will depend upon on the total number of lists being monitored. As of April 2012, Storyful are currently monitoring 124 stories, topics, and geopolitical regions using the deployed system.
The curation system is not limited to generating recom-mendations. When the system is used to monitor lists cov-ering dozens or hundreds of news stories, it will often be important for journalists to focus their limited time on a subset of these lists, where breaking developments are oc-curring. To facilitate this kind of prioristisation, we moni-tor the velocity of the lists being monitored by the system. The velocity measure is a combination of several indicators including tweet similarity, the level of activity of the core users, and tweet frequency. The velocity measure can de-tect significant or unusual tweet activity, often indicating a breaking news story (see Fig. 4).
While the curation system presented here is primarily used as a support tool within Storyful for curating lists of sources for online journalism, we are currently investigating its use in other applications that involve social media exploration and
