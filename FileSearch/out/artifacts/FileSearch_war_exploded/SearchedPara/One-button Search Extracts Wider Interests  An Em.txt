 This poster presents an overview of the characteristics of a one-button information retrieval interface with closed captions from TV watching activities, which is in tended to lighten the burden of remembering and entering query terms while watching TV. We investigated this interface with an experimental system named Video Bookmarking Search , which estimates query terms from closed captions with named-entity recognition and sentence labeling techniques. According to an empirical evaluation for 1,138 search queries from 206 bookm arks using seven actual TV shows on city life, travel, health, and cuisine, we found wider queries and search results are acceptable through the query-input-free interface, despite the fact that the number of queries and search results that are directly relevant to the users X  original intentions is not high. The ma in reason is a watching user X  X  interest is wider than what is expressed with query terms. Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval General Terms: Human Factors, Experimentation User satisfaction, acceptab ility, and closed captions. The experience of diverse TV content prompts questions or thoughts such as the following in each user X  X  mind:  X  Who is the actor in this TV show?  X ,  X  I would like to know the details of this restaurant!  X , and  X  How much is that product? How can I buy it?  X  In such cases, the user may want to check on the Internet or ask someone for such information. However, there are three problems. First, the user may forget what he wanted. Second, it is burdensome to specify each focused term as text. Third, it is difficult to formulate appropriate Web search queries according to the meaning of terms. For the fi rst problem, a method of marking each user X  X  interests or intentions in association with related information is required. For the second problem, it is necessary to find appropriate terms from the TV content. For the third problem, it is necessary to create a proper search query corresponding to the watching context in addition to the general viewpoint existing works have dealt with [2][3]. As one solution, we proposed an information retrieval style for TV content called Video Bookmarking Search , which enables a user to search for information with terms extracted from closed captions by instantly pushing a button of a remote controller [5]. terms are sorted in order of these scores, and then search queries are generated for each term according to its named entity. We investigated to what degree our generated queries and search results satisfy the user. First, we let three subjects bookmark the clips and annotate request terms and their intention when they wanted to search content. Our test collection cons ists of seven clips from five different TV series on city life, travel, health, and cuisine totaling approximately seven hours. Then, each user rated search queries and results from two perspectives: relevance and acceptability . Relevance means to what degree our queries and search results satisfy the user X  X  conscious request when the user bookmarked the scene at three levels: relevant (2); somewhat related (1); not relevant (0). This measure is like the user satisfaction measure used in [1]. We also introduced acceptability, which means to what degree our queries and search results are acceptable to the user, regardless of the user X  X  or iginal demand. This score means the user X  X  unconscious request at three levels: search results are required for queries or actual We b pages are required for search results (2); acceptable (1); not acceptable (0). In the current system, we used Google SOAP API as the search engine and the top two search results for each query. Table 1 and Table 2 summarize th e results of our experiments with 206 bookmarks for seven clips in total. In Table 1, the  X  X umber of queries X  column means the number of unique queries. If a user bookmarks twice or more in a short period, the same query sometimes appears in multiple bookmarks. We removed the effects of the  X  X uplicated X  bookmar ks from this experimentation. Table 2 shows the distribution of the maximum scores of queries or search results for each bookmark. From Table 1, we found the average relevance scores for both queries and search results are much lower than 1.0 (somewhat relevant). At first, we had an intuitive hypothesis that 70% of queries would acquire 2 or 1 scores because the previous report showed that the top five estim ated terms accounted for 66% of terms [5]. However, only 56.6% of queries acquired 2 (23.5%) or 1 (33.1%). This is because of the difference between appearance of query terms and actual search intention. This difference widened the gap in the result of search result relevance. Acceptability score for both queries and search results were also unexpected. These scores are much higher than 1.0 and most bookmarks included queries or search results with score of 2 or 1. This means that a user accepts search queries and results, and sometimes finds  X  X elevant answers X  from the overall list. There are two reasons. One reason is that users X  interests are wider than those they described by query terms, and query generation process with multiple specialized viewpoints extracts users X  hidden requests. It is difficult fo r the user to express all his interests as queries while watchi ng TV. The other reason is that a query list reminds each user of another interest. When the user reads the query terms as text, he recalls the scene and this makes him perform a search.
