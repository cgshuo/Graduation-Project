 1. Introduction (CH 4 ), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), ozone (O chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs). When greenhouse gases are present in large quantities in the atmosphere, i t results in  X  X  X reenhouse effect X  X , which causes the average temperature in the lower part of the atmosphere to increase, thereby causing global warming. CO of the important greenhouse gases responsible for about 70% of the enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming ( Houghton, 2004 ).
Due to increasing public concerns about environmental pollution and global warming, the post combustion CO 2 capture process is com-monly adopted for eliminating or reducing industrial CO 2 and this technology has been widely used in the natural gas processing and chemical processing industries ( Ma X  X un et al., 2007 ). good understanding of the intricate relationships among the parameters involved in the CO 2 capture process is necessary. A review of the relevant literature reveals that the most significant parameters that influence plant performance and efficiency include CO 2 production rate, heat duty, lean loading, and CO absorption efficiency. The objective of this research is to study the nature of relationships among these four parameters and other key process parameters in the CO 2 capture system. The data which provided the basis of our modeling study were collected from the amine-based post combustion CO 2 capture process system at the International Test Centre (ITC) of CO 2 Capture located in Regina, Saskatchewan of Canada from 2003 to 2006.
A statistical analysis of the data was conducted and the results were reported in Zhou et al. (2008) . A number of weaknesses were observed in the statistical modeling study. For example, the selection of the parameters completely relied on the experts X  opinions and the uncertain parameters were excluded from the modeling process, the inclusion of parameters in the regression models was restricted to avoid multicollinearity, and the statis-tical approach was deficient in uncovering the irregular and non-linear relationships that possibly existed among the para-meters. Therefore, alternative approaches that can address the weaknesses of the statistical approach are needed.

In this study, two different approaches have been adopted for modelingthesameoperationaldata : (1) artificial neural networks (ANN) combined with sensitivity analysis (SA), and (2) the neuro-fuzzy modeling technique. In the combined ANN and SA approach, four neural network models of the relationships among the parameters were developed, and the sensitivity analysis method was applied to explicate the relative order of significance among the parameters. The insignificant param eters were tentatively removed from the models based on the results of sensitivity analysis. The refined models were validated by the experts, and then reapplied to thedataforgeneratinganewsetofpredictivemodels.Thenew models demonstrated improved performance.

However, while the ANN models included more parameters and generated higher accuracies than the statistical models reported in Zhou et al. (2008) , they suffer from the weakness of opacity. That is, the ANN models act like black boxes which cannot describe the nature of the relationships among the para-meters. Consequently the neuro-fuzzy modeling approach was adopted. By applying neuro-fuzzy modeling on the significant parameters identified in the ANN approach, four fuzzy inference systems were developed. These four inference systems demon-strate high modeling accuracies, and consist of membership functions and fuzzy rules which effectively interpret the nature of relationships among the parameters.

Our study involved 4 output parameters and in total 9 critical input parameters which likely impact on the output parameters. Based on the experts X  opinion, the same input parameter could have different influence or relation to the different output para-meters. Therefore, four separate and independent models were developed to explicate the relationships among the input para-meters and each of the output parameters. The sensitivity analysis is in fact a multivariable analysis, which enabled us to unravel the influence of each input parameter to the output parameters, thereby eliminating the redundant input parameters and developing a more refined parameter set for each output parameter. As a result, although 9 input parameters were initially involved in the study, they were not included in all of the models for the four output parameters. This paper describes the modeling and analysis procedures using (1) the combined ANN and SA approach and (2) the neuro-fuzzy approach, and discusses the results from the two modeling approaches.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the background literature relevant to the areas of CO 2 capture process system, artificial neural network, sensitivity analysis, and adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Section 3 discusses the parameter selection and data filtering processes. Section 4 describes the process of data modeling with neural network modeling combined with sensitivity analysis and neural fuzzy modeling with ANFIS. Section 5 provides a compar-ison of the results from the two different modeling approaches, a conclusion, and some directions of future work. 2. Literature review 2.1. CO 2 capture domain The details of the amine-based CO 2 capture process system at the ITC can be found in Zhou et al. (2008) . Among over one hundred parameters in the CO 2 capture process system, four of them are used for evaluating the process efficiency and plant performance: (1) CO 2 production rate, which reflects the amount of wet CO (2) Heat duty, which shows the amount of heat required for (3) CO 2 absorption efficiency, which reflects the amount of the CO (4) Lean loading, which reflects the amount of CO 2 contained in 2.2. Artificial neural network and sensitivity analysis
An artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational system based on the operation mechanism of biological neural networks. As a data processing system, an artificial neural network accepts inputs and exports outputs. Inputs usually represent the known parameters while outputs stand for the target parameters. During the process of neural network training or learning, a set of data including inputs and desired outputs are provided to the network model. Artificial neurons are often organized in different layers.
Sensitivity analysis (SA) is the study of how the variation or uncertainty in the output of a mathematical model can be apportioned, qualitatively or quantitatively, to different sources of variation in the input of a model ( Cacuci et al., 2005 ). Generally sensitivity analysis introduces a formalized procedure, which identifies how  X  X  X ensitive X  X  the model output is to changes in various model components. The sensitivity analysis method helps to explicate more precisely the influence of the input parameters.
In our research study, sensitivity analysis on the input para-meters was performed in our attempt to unravel the precise relationships among the conditional or input parameters and the consequent outputs. The sensitivity analysis will inform us on which input parameter(s) is/are more important in predicting accurate output values ( Yao, 2003 ). 2.3. Neuro-fuzzy technology and system
The weakness in the ANN approach is that it does not reveal the nature of relationships among th e parameters of the process. To address this weakness, we appli ed the fuzzy modeling approach so that relationships among the parameters can be explicated. A fuzzy inference system models the qualitative aspects of human knowl-edge and reasoning processes without adopting precise quantitative analyses to delineate non-linear re lationships among the indepen-dent and dependent variables ( Khajeh et al., 2009 ). It contains a fuzzy rule base, which can be used to explicate the relationships among the parameters. However, our efforts at knowledge acquisi-tion with the experts of CO 2 capture technology revealed that they could not provide the rules and good membership functions for handling uncertainty in the data. In our search for a technology that supports generating reliable membership functions and rule base, the neuro-fuzzy technique became d istinctively attractive for mod-eling the CO 2 capture process due to two features: (1) it is able to develop membership functions and r ules which interpret the inter-relationships among the paramet ers by learning from the large set of historical operating data from ITC, and (2) the real-world applications of this technique show that it can achieve high accuracy of modeling.

The neuro-fuzzy technology combines the desirable properties and reduces the disadvantages of both the ANN and fuzzy logic techniques. Neural networks act like black boxes  X  they can learn from the data but the results cannot be interpreted. Fuzzy inference systems consist of interpretable rules, but they cannot learn from the data. A neuro-fuzzy system combines interpret-ability of the fuzzy inference system and the learning ability of the ANN approach. In the process of developing the fuzzy inference systems, they can learn from given data samples so as to determine the parameters of the membership function sets and fuzzy rules. 2.4. ANFIS and its applications
A number of neuro-fuzzy systems can be found in the relevant literature ( Halgamuge and Glesner, 1994; Berenji and Khedkar, 1992; Nadine, 1997; Horikawa et al., 1992; Jang, 1993; Jang and
Sun, 1995 ). The adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is a fuzzy inference system implemented in the framework of an adaptive neural network ( Jang, 1993 ); it has been widely adopted in many real world applications and all achieved high accuracies ( Jang, 1993; Jang and Sun, 1995; Yeh et al., 2005; Lo, 2002; Schurter and Roschke, 2002; Cai et al., 2003 ). The ANFIS architecture can be used for const ructing an input X  X utput mapping based on human knowledge and stipulated input X  X utput data pairs. 3. Parameter selection and data filtering capture process system used for evaluating process efficiency and plant performance include the following: (1) CO 2 production rate, (2) heat duty, (3) lean loading, and (4) absorption efficiency.
Therefore, these four parameters are defined as dependent or output variables in our study.
 meters include the following: (1) amine concentration, (2) amine circulation rate (the tag name in the CO 2 capture process is FT-600), (3) steam flow rate (FT-103C), (4) steam pressure of reboiler (PT-103A), (5) reboiler pressure (PT-660), (6) CO 2 concentration in flue gas (AIT-203), (7) absorber inlet gas actual flow factored for concentration (FI200ACT), and (8) off gas flow rate (FI-901).
Therefore, these eight parameters are defined as independent or input variables in our study.
 used for developing individual prediction models for the four output variables, but the input variables that were included in the two approaches were different. In the ANN model, the eight independent variables listed above were adopted for modeling each dependent variable. The modeling results were then analyzed using sensitivity analysis and validated by the e xperts. The validation process resulted in some input or independent variables being removed from the models, and new refined models were developed for each dependent variable. These refined models were used as the basis for developing the neuro-fuzzy systems.
 collected from the CO 2 capture plant at ITC during the years 2003 X 2006. Typically the plant starts running at 9:30 a.m. and shuts down at 4:30 p.m. every workday, and the sensors collected the field data every 5 min. Since only the stable and reliable data can be used for modeling and analysis to ensure accuracy and reliability of the developed models, pre-screening of the collected data was performed. The detailed filtering steps are described in Zhou et al. (2009) .
 meters of the CO 2 capture plant, which is shown in Table 1 . 4. Approaches of modeling and analysis 4.1. Statistical study
Application of the statistical modeling process for analyzing the data involved conducting regression analysis on the Statistical
Package for Social Science (SPSS) (trademark of SPSS Inc., USA) and three linear functions and one cubic function models were devel-oped. The accuracies of the developed models ranged between 70% and 90%. A number of limitations can be observed in the statistical modeling study. Firstly the parameters to be included for modeling were selected based solely on expert knowledge, and any uncertain input parameters were excluded. This approach implies that any uncertainty that existed in the re lationships was ignored. Secondly the issue of multicollinearity considered in statistical modeling restricted the inclusion of the parameters in the models. That is, if there is a linear relationship between two parameters, they cannot be simultaneously used as input parameters in one model although they both have influence on the output parameter. Thirdly the ten non-linear functions provided by SPSS, which included the expo-nential and cubic functions, may no t adequately model the irregular and non-linear relationships among the parameters. Fourthly the predictive accuracies of the stati stical models ranged between 70% and 90%, which can be improved.
 To improve upon the statistical modeling approach, we adopted
ANN modeling combined with sensitivity analysis. This approach was chosen because it directly addresses three of the four weak-nesses of the statistical approach noted above. First, instead of restricting to only the ten non-linear functions provided by SPSS,
ANN can model any complicated and irregular non-linear relation-ships among the parameters. Secondly the issue of multicollinearity is not relevant in the ANN approach. Hence it can include inter-related parameters as input parameters in the same model. Thirdly instead of ignoring uncertain para meters, all the relevant indepen-dent parameters are initially included in the ANN modeling. Then sensitivity analysis modeling was applied so as to determine the relative significances of the independent to the dependent para-meters. While the statistical approach relied only on human expertise for selecting the independent parameters and ignored those that involved uncertainty, the combined ANN and SA approach included all relevant i ndependent parameters but mana-ged the uncertainty by subsequent ly eliminating those which do not have significant influence on t he dependent parameter. 4.2. Neural network modeling combined with sensitivity analysis
The first stage of the data analysis process that involved the combined approach includes the following steps: (1) Construct the ANN models that relate the 9 independent or (2) Perform sensitivity analysis on the modeling results and (3) Validate the refined models with the experts. (4) Apply the refined ANN models to the data again and compare 4.2.1. Construction of the neural network models
Generally the number of units in the input layer depends on the number of known inputs, and the number of the output layer units is decided by the desired outputs. However no clear rule exists for determining the number of hidden layer units. One suggestion is to define the number of hidden units as half of the sum of the inputs and output units ( Poh et al., 1998 ). The number of hidden layers needs to be determined for a specific application because an overly complex model would lead to over learning of the network.

Research shows a correlation between the accuracy of pre-dictive results and the network configurations ( Han and Kamber, 2006 ), hence the configuration of network has to be determined before importing the data. It has been suggested that a back-propagation neural network is an efficient function approximator, given the network includes sufficient number of hidden nodes with sigmoid output functions ( Poh et al., 1998 ). In our study, a feed-forward back-propagation neural network was adopted for its simplicity and maturity. The number of hidden layers was set to 1 to simplify the model building process since a one-hidden-layer network is typically sufficient for modeling most industrial tasks. The learning rate and momentum are set to 0.3 and 0.2, respectively, because the respective values are commonly used in industrial process modeling ( Hodouin et al., 1991 ). The outputs are the predicted variables while the inputs are the conditional variables that influence the outputs and for which data are available.

After configuring the network, it was trained with the follow-ing parameters: Number of inputs: 9.
 Number of outputs: 4.
 Number of hidden layers: 1.
 Number of hidden layer units: 4.
 Learning rate: 0.3.
 Momentum: 0.2.
 Activation function: sigmoid function.

Number of epochs: 500. 4.2.2. Back propagation results for the ANN
The modeling process began with constructing the ANN models, and then sensitivity analysis was conducted on the modeling results. The models were constructed using Weka version 3.4.12 (trademark of Weka), which is a data mining software in Java. Four different prediction models that relate the eight independent variables with each of the predicted or depen-dent variables were developed. A summary of the four prediction models developed is shown in Table 2 .

The correlation coefficient ( R ) represents the amount of varia-tion in the consequent variable that is accounted for by the model; it is a measure of how well the model performs in predicting the dependent variable ( Field, 2000 ). The R value for the ANN prediction model for CO 2 production rate is 99%, while the other 3 prediction models for heat duty, absorption efficiency and lean loading all approximate or are over 90%. It can be observed from the prediction results that the models are simulat-ing the relationships between the 8 independent variables and the 4 dependent variables with high accuracy.

We hypothesized that not all the independent parameters contribute significant influences on the target dependent outputs.
Hence, it is likely that some independent parameters can be removed without reducing the predictive power of the model. To analyze the contribution of each input variable, sensitivity ana-lysis was conducted. 4.2.3. Sensitivity analysis
The experts for this project included the CO 2 capture process system engineers and researchers at ITC, who initially selected the predictive parameters based on their experience and knowl-edge. However, even experts could not specify each parameter X  X  precise and measurable influence on the outputs. The sensitivity analysis approach can explicate the input parameters X  precise influences on the outputs when values of the inputs change, thereby enhancing understanding about the uncertainties asso-ciated with the model parameters. Two sensitivity analysis (SA) methods were adopted in this study, namely the equation method and the variable perturbation method.

The equation and variable perturbation method of sensitivity analysis were implemented by adding a small module into Weka version 3.4.12 (trademark of Weka). Since Weka is an open source software, customized code can be added to enhance the capability of the software. The enhanced system, which includes the two methods for calculating the sensitivities, was applied to each of the four ANN models presented Section 3. In the prediction model for CO 2 production rate (FI-700), the model consists of 9 indepen-dent parameters, which include the 8 independent parameters and heat duty. It is noted that while heat duty is a dependent variable, it also can act as an independent variable because according to the experts, it might have significant influence on the CO 2 production rate. Hence it is added as an independent or input variable in this model. The results from the sensitivity analysis conducted on these 9 parameters and the influences of each parameter to the production rate are shown in Table 3 .
It can be seen from Table 3 that the steam from reboiler flow rate (FT-103C) has the greatest influence on the production rate based on the equation method of sensitivity analysis. On the other hand, the results from applying the variable perturbation method show that not only the steam from reboiler flow rate (FT-103C), but also amine concentration (molarity) contribute significantly to the production rate. The different results are due to the different mechanisms used in the two methods.

While it cannot be determined from the results which method is more accurate, it is possible to identify which parameter(s) are not useful in this model. From Table 3 , it can be seen that both methods reveal that absorber in gas actual flow (FI200ACT), input absorber fluid CO 2 gas (AIT-203), absorber TK440 off gas flow (FI-901), lean amine to absorber flow rate (FT-600) and reboiler pressure (PT-660) have very low sensitivities compared to the other independent or input parameters. In other words, changes in these parameters would not affect the target outputs of CO production rate, heat duty, lean loading, and CO 2 absorption efficiency. By eliminating the insignificant variables from the model, we can simplify the model. Similar analysis was conducted on the other 3 prediction models for heat duty, lean loading and absorption efficiency, as shown in Tables 4 X 6 .
 equation method results are very different from those of the variable perturbation method. But in either case, the amine concentration (molarity) and absorption efficiency both show relatively low sensitivities to the heat duty compared to the other inputs. Hence, the two input parameters can be eliminated. the parameters show some influence on the output and no input variables need to be eliminated. This observation needs to be validated by the experts.
 tion. It can be observed that the sensitivity analysis results from the two SA calculation methods are very similar. Based on our observation, only the parameter of lean loading can be removed from the inputs. Again, this has to be validated by the experts. The expert validation process will be discussed in the next section. 4.2.4. Expert validation and model reformulation during an interview. In the prediction model for production rate (FI-700) ( Table 10 ), the SA results suggest that the parameters of (1) reboiler pressure (PT-660), (2) pressure of steam entered reboiler (PT-103A), (3) steam from reboiler flow rate (FT-103C), (4) amine concentration (molarity), and (5) the amount of energy used for solvent regeneration (heat duty) highly contribute to the output of production rate of CO 2 . While the experts agreed that these parameters have significant influences on the production rate, they also considered in addition to the above that the following parameters are important input variables for predicting
CO 2 production rate (FI-700): (a) absorber in gas actual flow (FI200ACT) and (b) lean amine to absorber flow rate (FT-600). The divergence of their opinion from the modeling results can be explained by the range of values of the modeled data, which will be explained later.

Based on the SA results and experts X  opinion, the prediction model for CO 2 production rate was refined. Table 7 (last column) shows the reformulated ANN model for production rate predic-tion. It is noted from the last row of Table 6 that the R of the refined model (0.999) is the same as the previous R value (0.999).
In other words, the refined model is able to predict CO 2 tion as well as the original model even though two input parameters were eliminated.

Similar validations were conducted for the other three predic-tion models, which are discussed as follows.

For the prediction model for heat duty ( Table 8 ), the SA results showed that the amine concentration (molarity) and absorption efficiency parameters contribute little influence to the heat duty output parameter. However, the experts insisted that the two parameters are useful in the general situation. Moreover, they suggested that the parameters of absorber in gas actual flow (the tag name is FI200ACT), absorber TK440 off gas flow (FI-901) and reboiler pressure (PT-660) can be removed from the model.
Although this suggestion does not agree with our observations from the SA, the model was refined according to the experts X  suggestions because we believe that the experts X  experiences are more valuable. The R value in the refined model is 0.9018, which is about 2% less than the original model X  X  R value of 0.929. Hence, we conclude that the elimination of the three parameters was acceptable.

In the prediction model for lean loading ( Table 9 ), the SA results from the two different methods were not consistent. During the validation process, we found the experts X  opinions were more aligned with the results from the perturbation method. Hence, the experts X  opinions were combined with the perturbation method results and we concluded that input para-meters of absorber fluid CO 2 gas (AIT-203), absorber TK440 off gas flow (FI-901) and heat duty can be removed from the original model. The R value of the refined model is 0.851 and compared to the R value of the original model of 0.884, this is only a 3% decrease. Therefore, the elimination of the three variables was acceptable.

For the prediction model for absorption efficiency ( Table 10 ), the SA results suggested that the lean loading parameter can be eliminated. The experts validated the SA results and hence, the lean loading parameter was removed from the original model. Compared to the original model X  X  R value of 0.9475, the refined model X  X  R value is 0.9233. The decline of about 2% in the R value indicates that the elimination of the parameter of lean loading was acceptable.

It can be observed from the R values for the three prediction models for heat duty, lean loading and absorption efficiency that the refined models can still predict the target outputs with relatively high accuracy. The reductions in the refined models X  R values have been limited to within 3 percentage points. The predictive power of the refined models is considered acceptable and the refined models with fewer input parameters require less training time and are simpler.
 based on the combined ANN and SA approach are different from those defined by the experts. Although experts selected the related parameters based on their operational experience, they were not fully cognizant of the significance and explicit influence of the input parameters to the output parameters. In our study, artificial intelligence techniques were applied to model the relationships among the critical parameters, and the data model-ing results generated models that are different from the expert X  X  understanding. The model was refined according to the experts X  suggestions because we believe that the experts X  experiences are more valuable. The experts analyze the performance of the plant when it is at stable states; therefore they formulated the relation-ships among the parameters based on a limited range of values for the operation parameters. The set of operational data used for data modeling, which spanned 3 years, actually covered the entire operating range of the plant including both stable and unstable states of the plant. Since the considered ranges of data values are different, it is reasonable that the experts X  opinion is different from the data analysis results. The objective of our research is to study the plant operations at the stable condition, therefore, the experts X  opinions were given more weight when they conflict with the data analysis result. This is our current hypothesis for explaining the gap between the modeling results and the experts X  opinions, and the hypothesis was developed based on discussions with the experts. A study that focuses on investigating the reasons for the divergence between the experts X  knowledge and the data modeling results can be conducted in the future.
Compared to the statistical study reported in Zhou et al. (2008) , the combined ANN and SA study adopted more compre-hensive sets of relevant independent parameters. After the ANN models were developed, sensitivity analysis was conducted to reveal the relative significance of the independent parameters in each model and the less significant parameters were eliminated with the experts X  approval. In this process, uncertainty was not ignored and the refined ANN models consist of parameter sets that are more reliable and inclusive than the ones selected by the experts in the statistical study. Since the ANN modeling explored all types of irregular and non-linear relationships among these parameters, it supports a more comprehensive exploration and modeling of the problem space defined by the CO 2 process parameters. The combined ANN and SA approach generated predictive accuracies of 80 X 90%, which is higher than the accura-cies of 70 X 90% produced by the statistical models. Despite the advantages of the combined approach over the statistical study, the ANN and SA method was not able to explicate the nature of relationships among the parameters. This drawback leads us to adopt the neuro-fuzzy approach because it not only can model the non-linear relationships but the fuzzy inference systems (FIS) generated in fact serve as an explicit knowledge base about the
CO 2 capture process system. 4.3. Neuro-fuzzy modeling 4.3.1. Data division
After filtering the data as discussed in Section 3, there are altogether 10,422 tuples of data that remained. The set of parameter data was then divided into three subsets for neuro-fuzzy modeling: (1) The training dataset consists of 5422 tuples of randomly (2) The checking dataset was used together with the training (3) The testing dataset was used for model validation to check the
The data selected for the training process has significant impact on the predictive power of the fuzzy inference model developed by ANFIS; the modeling accuracy will be high if the training data presented to ANFIS for training are fully represen-tative of the features of the data space being modeled. Therefore, the data windows for the training data should be kept as wide as possible. For training purposes, we selected the data which covers the entire range of values for each parameter so that they fully represent all the operational conditions. For validation and testing purposes, we randomly selected data from the rest of the dataset. There is no overlap or duplicate data samples among these three datasets, i.e., no data sample can exist in more than one dataset. 4.3.2. Architecture and learning algorithm of ANFIS
An adaptive network is a multi-layer feed-forward neural network with supervised learning capability, and it is functionally equivalent to a Sugeno type fuzzy inference system. The adaptive network is a superset of all kinds of feed-forward neural networks with supervised learning capability ( Jang, 1993 ). The ANFIS architecture is a fuzzy inference system implemented in the framework of adaptive networks. An ANFIS consists of nodes connected through the directional links, and each node performs a particular function on the incoming signal. Some of the nodes are adaptive and contain a set of parameters. The output of the adaptive nodes depends on these parameters, whose values can be changed during the learning process based on the given training data so as to minimize a prescribed error measure ( Jang, 1993 ). The hybrid learning algorithm was adopted in the ANFIS. The hybrid learning rule combines the back-propagation gradient descent method and the least squares estimate (LSE) to update the parameters in the adaptive network. By learning the stipulated input X  X utput mappings from the training dataset, ANFIS can adjust the parameters of the initialized FIS and reconstruct a new FIS with appropriate membership functions and a set of fuzzy rules. The architecture of an ANFIS model is shown in Fig. 1 ( Jang, 1993; Jang and Sun, 1995; Yeh et al., 2005 ).
The basic learning rule of the adaptive networks, which was based on the gradient descent and the chain rule, was introduced in the 1970s ( Werbos, 1974 ). However, the basic learning rule was gradually discarded because of its slowness. In its place, a hybrid learning algorithm was proposed, which can substantially reduce the time needed for the learning process. 4.3.3. ANFIS modeling Since the study involves the four output variables of heat duty, CO 2 production rate, lean loading, and CO 2 absorption efficiency, the training process is independently conducted for each output variable and four fuzzy inference systems were developed. Each fuzzy inference system consists of one output with the set of input variables refined by the processes of SA and expert valida-tion. For example, the independent variables used for modeling heat duty include the six variables listed in the last column of Table 7 : (1) CO 2 concentration of flue gas into absorber (AIT-203), (2) amine solvent circulation rate (FT-600), (3) pressure of inlet steam of reboiler (PT-103A), (4) flow rate of outlet steam of reboiler (FT-103C), (5) amine concentration, and (6) CO absorption efficiency. The procedure of ANFIS modeling is dis-cussed as follows. 4.3.3.1. Initialization of membership functions of variables. The first step in developing the fuzzy inference system involves defining the input and output variables of the systems. The second step involves determining the types and number of membership functions for the input and output variables for ANFIS so as to initialize the fuzzy inference system. Take the input variables for heat duty as instance, according to the experienced operators, the operating range of CO 2 concentration in flue gas into absorber (AIT-203) can be divided into the three regions of {high, medium, low}, the operating range of amine solvent circulation rate (FT-600) can be divided into the three regions of {fast, medium, slow}, the operating range of pressure of inlet steam of reboiler (PT-103A) can be divided into the three regions of {high, medium, low}, the operating range of flow rate of outlet steam of reboiler (FT-103C) can be divided into the three regions of {fast, medium, slow}, the operating range of amine concentration can be divided into the three regions of {high, medium, low}, and the CO tion efficiency can be divided into the three regions of {high, med-ium, low}. Correspondingly the numbers of membership functions (MF) associated with these six input variables are all three, as shown in Table 11 .

The default Gaussian function was selected to be the form of the membership function, and the center and width of each membership function were initialized by ANFIS. These parameters associated with the membership functions will be adjusted during the training process.

Since the algorithm of ANFIS was functionally equivalent to the Sugeno type fuzzy inference system, the membership function of the output variables can be of only two types: either a linear function or a constant. Since a constant output is unlikely when the input variable covers a range of values, we selected the linear type of membership function for the output variables.
For the output variables of CO 2 production rate, lean loading, and absorption efficiency, the numbers of membership functions (MF) for each input are shown in Tables 12 X 14 . 4.3.3.2. Generation of fuzzy inference system. Grid partitioning was used for initializing the fuzzy inference system. The entire input m n space is partitioned into fuzzy subspaces based on the dimension of input variables and the qualities associated with each input variable. Consider the input variables of x and y , three qualitative labels { M 1 , M 2 , M 3 } are associated with x and three qualitative labels { N 1 , N 2 , N 3 } are associated with y. As a result, they can form into nine 2-dimensional data clusters { M 1 N 1 , M 1 N 2 of these 2-dimensional data clusters becomes a fuzzy input sub-space. Each subspace is delineated in the premise part of a rule, and the output within this fuzzy subspace is specified by the consequent of the rule. Each rule is considered activated only in a particular subspace ( Jang, 1993 ). Consequently the number of rules is equal to the number of the fuzzy subspaces, which is determined by the input dimensions and the number of member-ship functions associated with each input. Take heat duty for instance, since the numbers of membership functions associated with the six input variables are a ll three our 6-dimensional input space can be partitioned into 3 6  X  729 subspaces, which determines the fuzzy inference system for heat duty will consist of 729 rules.
For CO 2 production rate, lean loading, and absorption efficiency, based on the membership functions of the input variables shown in Tables 12 X 14 , the rule bases of the fuzzy inference systems for these three parameters consist of 648, 729, and 576 rules, respec-tively, based on the algorithm of grid partitioning ( Jang, 1993 ). 4.3.3.3. Determination of learning parameters. At this step, the parameters of the learning procedure need to be determined.
These parameters include error tolerance, the number of training epochs, and the learning algorithm. The training error tolerance and the number of training epochs are the criteria for stopping the training process. The training process stops whenever the maximum epoch number is reached or the training error goal is achieved. We set the error tolerance at 0 and 30 epochs for training. The checking dataset is applied to validate the developed
FIS in order to gauge the model X  X  response to the data, thereby avoiding overtraining of the developed model. The checking data is applied to the model at each training epoch and the checking error is calculated, which represents the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) for the checking data at each epoch. It can be observed that the checking error decreases as the training proceeds, but it suddenly increases when the model begins to be overtrained on the training dataset. Therefore, the output FIS structure associated with the minimum checking error is adopted in our study and used for the further calculation. In this way, overtraining of the model can be avoided. The hybrid learning algorithm was adopted in this study. The hybrid learning rule combines the back-pro-pagation gradient descent method and the least squares estimate (LSE) to update the parameters in the adaptive network. Each epoch of the hybrid learning procedure is composed of a forward pass and a backward pass. In the forward pass, the input and functional signals propagate forward until layer 4, and the con-sequent parameters are identified by the least square estimate in layer 4 ( Jang, 1993 ). After identifying the consequent parameters, the functional signals keep going forward until the error measure is calculated. In the backward pass, the error rate, i.e., the deri-vative of the error measure with respect to each node output propagates backward from the output end toward the input end, and the premise parameters are updated by the gradient descent method ( Jang, 1993; Jang and Sun, 1995 ). The activities in each pass are shown in Table 15 . 4.3.3.4. Result: fuzzy inference system. The fuzzy inference system is a system that models the qualitative aspects of human knowledge and reasoning processes by employing fuzzy inference and user-defined rules to map an input space to an output space ( Chai et al., 2009 ). In our study, a fuzzy inference system was developed after the training process was completed, i.e., the membership functions were adjusted and the rules were gener-ated. The structure of a sample inference system for heat duty is shown in Fig. 2 .
 The membership functions of the six inputs are in the form of a
Gaussian function, and the numbers of membership functions of each input are three, as shown in the brackets following the name of the input variable. The rule base consists of 729 Sugeno-type rules. The premise part of each rule is a conjunction of qualitative labels of the input variables connected by  X  X  X ND X  X ; the consequent part is a linear function between the output variable and all the input variables. For example, one sample rule is given in Table 16 , which can be presented as: If CO 2 concentration of flue gas is low, and amine circulation rate is fast, and pressure of inlet steam of reboiler is medium, and steam flow rate is slow, and amine concentration is medium, and absorption efficiency is high, then the value of heat duty can be calculated by the linear function in the consequent part of this rule.

For each turple or row of input values, a rule calculates the output value according to the linear function in the consequent part of the rule. Since there are 729 rules in the fuzzy inference system for heat duty, there will be 729 output values which are calculated using the 729 linear functions. The final output value is then calculated based on each rule X  X  output value and firing strength, and the details will be given in Section 4.3.5. 4.3.4. Tuned membership functions
The membership functions of the input variables were initi-alized by the ANFIS before the training process started. The training process changed the parameters of the initial member-ship functions to optimize their representation of the input and output mappings, thereby changing the shapes of the member-ship functions. Therefore, the final membership functions would display different forms from the initial ones. Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively, show two samples of initial and final function memberships of the pressure of inlet steam into reboiler and amine concentration in the fuzzy inference system; both variables are for predicting heat duty. It can be observed that one dis-tinctive change of the pressure of inlet steam into reboiler that resulted from training the ANFIS is that the medium membership function is shifted to the higher range and covers a narrower region after training, as shown in Fig. 3 (b). For the amine concentration, the medium membership function also shrinks to a narrower region and shifted to a lower range, as shown in Fig. 4 (b).

Although only slight changes are shown in the span or position of membership functions after training, these changes can cause distinct changes in the fuzzy inference process because the degree of the membership function to which a given value of the input variable belongs is changed. According to Eq. (1) in Section 4.3.5, the firing strength of each rule will be changed as the firing strength is determined by the minimum membership function among all the input variables. As a result, the rules have different weights or significances, which will generate different values of the weighted outputs. Therefore, a different value of the final output will be generated due to slight changes of the membership functions of the input variables. Hence, even the slight changes of the membership functions of the input variables shown in Fig. 4 Amine Concentration (3) Absorption Efficiency (3) are significant because they will generate completely different prediction results. 4.3.5. Rules
Sugeno type rule is a linear function between the output and all the inputs. Since 729 rules were developed in the fuzzy inference system for heat duty, there are 729 linear functions relating the inputs and heat duty. The coefficeints for the six inputs and one constant in each rule were determined in the learning process.
Assume the six coefficients are a i , b i , d i , g i , r e i , then the i th rule is in the form of: circulation rate (FT-600) is B l , and pressure of inlet steam of reboiler (PT-103A) is C l , and steam flow rate (FT-103C) is D amine concentration is E l , and absorption efficiency is F
O i  X  a i  X  AIT-203  X  X  b i  X  FT-600  X  X  d i  X  PT-103A  X  X  g functions for each input variable, and O i is the output in the i th rule.
 w i of the rule. Since they are all AND rules, the AND method is applied and the minimum weight is selected as the firing strength: w i  X  AND method  X  F AIT-203  X  A l  X  , F FT-600  X  B l  X  , F where F ( n ) are the membership functions for the six inputs, wildcard representing all the labels of the membership functions, and i  X  1, 2, y ,729.

Then the final output O f is calculated with the following equation:
O  X 
For model validation, 220 tuples of data were randomly selected and used to test the models developed. The accuracy of the model was determined by calculating the deviation of the predicted values from the actual measured values. The testing results are satisfactory and are shown in Table 17 . As can be seen from Table 17 , the accuracy of the inference system for reboiler heat duty is 95.0%, the modeling accuracy of the inference system for CO 2 production rate is 96.0%, that of the inference system for lean loading is 92.3%, and that of the inference system for CO absorption efficiency is 95.8%. Since the modeling accuracies of the inference systems for CO 2 production rate, reboiler heat duty, and CO 2 absorption efficiency are all over 95%, and accuracy of the inference systems for lean loading is close to 95%, we conclude that the inference systems for modeling the relationships among the process parameters give very satisfactory performance.
Compared to the accuracies generated in the combined ANN and SA study, it can be concluded that the neuro-fuzzy modeling approach achieved higher accuracies for modeling heat duty, lean loading, and absorption efficiency. On the other hand, the ANN modeling approach has higher accuracy for predicting CO 2 duction rate than the neuro-fuzzy modeling method. For the
ANFIS approach, the data selected for the training process has significant impact on the predictive power of the fuzzy inference model developed. The modeling accuracy will be high if the training data presented to ANFIS for training membership func-tion parameters are fully representative of the features of the data space that the fuzzy inference system aims to model. In our study, it is likely that the randomly selected data contain some noise data, especially for lean loading. It is possible that the noise data presented a biased representation of the features of the data space, thereby reducing accuracy of the models developed.
The sequential application of three approaches for modeling the CO 2 capture process has reached a milestone. While the combined ANN and SA approach was adopted to address weak-nesses noted in the earlier statistical study, the neuro-fuzzy approach was adopted to address the ANN X  X  weakness of opacity.
The neuro-fuzzy approach is, in our opinion, the preferred method for modeling the CO 2 capture process data because of the following reasons. First, the neuro-fuzzy models involved a comprehensive and reliable set of input parameters generated from the ANN modeling and analysis process. The sets of para-meters included both the significant and uncertain parameters that influence the process. Secondly the neuro-fuzzy approach was able to model the complex, irregular, and non-linear relation-ships among the parameters. In the modeling process, the neuro-fuzzy approach was not restricted to only the ten non-linear functions of the statistical study. This is a strength shared by the ANN and SA approach. Thirdly the neuro-fuzzy method proved to be superior to the ANN and SA approach because it generated the fuzzy inference systems which served as an explicit knowledge base about the relationships between the independent and dependent parameters of the process. The membership functions and rules in the inference systems can be used for future study of the CO 2 capture process. Fourthly the neuro-fuzzy approach generated on average the highest predictive accuracies compared to the other two approaches. While the statistical study generated predictive accuracies of 70 X 90% and the ANN and SA study generated predictive accuracies of 80 X 90%, the neuro-fuzzy method provided predictive accuracies of close to or over 95%. 5. Discussion and conclusion
In our research study on uncovering the relationships among the parameters in the CO 2 capture process, three techniques have been applied for data modeling and analysis: statistical regres-sion, ANN modeling combined with sensitivity analysis, and neuro-fuzzy modeling. This paper describes the two methods of (1) ANN modeling combined with sensitivity analysis and (2) neuro-fuzzy modeling. The three techniques were applied in sequence because each subsequent technique addressed the weaknesses of the previous one. The ANN and SA approach was conducted to address the disadvantages of the statistical study, namely, the restricted involvement of parameters and inability in uncovering all possible irregular and non-linear relationships among the parameters. The neuro-fuzzy technique was applied to explicate the nature of relationships among the parameters; this compensates for the weakness of opacity of the ANN approach. The neuro-fuzzy modeling approach developed fuzzy inference systems, which included membership functions and rules for interpreting the nature of relationships among the process parameters. Also, it can be observed that the neuro-fuzzy models provided the highest predictive accuracies compared to the other two approaches.

Some of our observations on the ANN modeling and AFNIS modeling methods are discussed below from the perspectives of characteristics of the techniques, predictive accuracy, inclusion of parameters, and support for explication of problem space.
Both ANN and ANFIS methods adopted the neural network approach and applied learning algorithms to the training dataset to capture the characteristics of relationships between the inputs and outputs. For these two techniques, the data selected for the training process has significant impact on the predictive power of the models developed. The modeling accuracy will be high if the set of parameter data for training membership functions are fully representative of the features of the data space that the neural network aims to model.

On predictive accuracy, the correlation coefficient ( R ) repre-sents the amount of variation in the consequent variable that is accounted for by the model. The correlation coefficient is a good indicator for evaluating the model X  X  prediction accuracy. From Table 17 , it can be seen that the ANN model can predict the CO 2 production rate with 4% higher accuracy than the ANFIS model. However, the ANFIS models were able to give better predictions for heat duty, lean loading, and absorption efficiency than the ANN models. Especially for lean loading, the ANFIS model achieves a prediction accuracy of 92.3%, which is over 7% higher than the R value of 85.1% given by the ANN models.
In terms of parameter inclusion, the ANN modeling initially used all of the eight independent parameters for neural network training. Then, when the relative importance of the input parameters had been revealed through sensitivity analysis, the insignificant ones were eliminated from the neural network models. The refined parameter sets generated from the sensitivity results and experts X  knowledge provided a good basis for the ANFIS modeling.
In terms of explication of the nature of the relationships among the parameters, the models developed by the ANN approach act like black boxes and provide little clue on the nature of relationships among the process parameters. By contrast, in the
ANFIS approach, the neural network was used to develop the fuzzy inference systems. The membership functions were tuned to represent the characteristics of the input variables, and the rules generated contained hundreds of numerical functions, which best emulate the relationships among the input/output variables. The membership functions and rules developed through the ANFIS method can serve as a knowledge base for further optimization studies of the process parameters.
We can conclude based on this study that the neuro-fuzzy modeling approach is a good method for studying the relation-ships among the parameters of the CO 2 capture process system. In the future, other process parameters will be studied and the method of ANFIS will be applied to an expanded parameter set in an effort towards a more comprehensive explication of relation-ships among a larger set of the process parameters of the CO capture process. Also, application of the rules developed through the ANFIS method for predicting and optimizing the CO 2 capture process system will also be an item on the future research agenda. Acknowledgments
