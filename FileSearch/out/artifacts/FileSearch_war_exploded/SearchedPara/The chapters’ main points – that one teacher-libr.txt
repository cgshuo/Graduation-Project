The chapters X  main points  X  that one teacher-librarian X  X  models emphasize  X  X  X rocedural and product goals X  X  and the other X  X  facilitate  X  X  X rocedural and conceptual understanding X  X   X  would also be more compelling if they were buttressed by more methodological detail. There is no discussion, for example, of the differences in the tasks the students of the two teacher-librarians undertook. The students of the  X  X  X roduct goals X  X  teacher-librar-ian were looking for specific information for class projects, while the students of the  X  X  X onceptual understand-ing X  X  teacher-librarian were learning to use a database without any specific goal (or deadline) in mind. Clearly, the differences in the students X  tasks must have had a strong influence on how the teacher-librarians ap-proached their teaching. Without seeing how the authors dealt methodologically with the relationship of task requirements to the teacher-librarians X  activities, however, it is difficult to tell how much their teaching related to their espoused and in-action models and how much it related to the students X  differing needs. Comparisons across general elements of the  X  X  X rocedural and product goals X  X  and  X  X  X rocedural and conceptual understand-ing X  X  models are nicely presented and illustrated in a ten-page table in Chapter 6, but the validity and reliability of those findings are unclear because of the book X  X  limited information about the data analysis.
Chapter 7 inherits these concerns, since its discussion rests on the material presented in the three  X  X  X indings X  X  chapters. Here, the authors link their findings to other research, detailing a series of questions about mental models that have been asked in previous studies and describing how their own findings confirm earlier insights.
More intriguing is their examination of what they call  X  X  X he crux of the role of mental models. On the one hand, mental models can be managed by their users to effect necessary changes. On the other hand, mental models can manage or control their users, thereby resulting in less satisfactory outcomes X  X  (p. 227). Their  X  X  X anaging Mental Models Flow Diagram X  X  graphically represents all three of the mental models they studied  X  espoused, in-action, and reflective  X  and shows both  X  X  X egative MMs [mental models] that controlled lesson(s) X  X  and  X  X  X ositive habituated MMs that liberated lessons X  X  (p. 228). While the attribution of value to particular mental models is questionable, the idea that mental models influence teaching in specific and detailed ways and that such models are difficult to change despite a stated desire to do so suggests many possibilities for future research. The authors X  conclusion that making teacher-librarians (and, by extension, other teachers) aware of this influence and of strategies for dealing with it suggests possibilities for practice as well.

John Talbot X  X  and Dominic Welsh X  X  Complexity and Cryptography: An Introduction , represents a welcome addition to academic mathematical literature. In practice, cryptography generally falls under the disciplinary umbrella of computer science. Talbot and Welsh X  X oth seasoned mathematicians X  X owever, have authored a text aimed at an audience much more at home in the world of pure mathematics than the world of micropro-cessors and computer algorithms.

John Talbot has served as a lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at University College London since 2003. Prior to this appointment, he served as a Research Fellow at Oxford. His research interests lie in the area of extremal combinatorics, particularly Turan-type problems for hypergraphs. Dominic Welsh is a research fellow of Merton College, Oxford, where he previously served as Professor of Mathematics. Dr. Welsh also held numerous visiting positions, including the John von Neumann Professorship at the University of Bonn.
The authors X  primary motivation for writing the text was to give mathematicians a deeper understanding of the underlying theoretical approaches to cryptography as well as  X  X  ... a taste for the beauty and importance of the subject, X  X  as they state in the preface. The text also provides a thorough introduction to complexity theory.
It should be noted, however, that this is not a comprehensive text. The authors do draw attention to this fact in the preface. For a more comprehensive and applied approach to the discipline, readers may want to turn to Stinson X  X  Cryptography: Theory and Practice (for a rigorous mathematical treatment) or Schneier X  X 
Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source code in C (for a less mathematical and more practi-cally driven approach), both seminal works in the field of cryptography. Topics such as cryptanalysis, elliptic curve cryptography, and quantum cryptography and computing are omitted by Talbot and Welsh to  X  X  ... keep the mathematical prerequisites at a minimum. X  X 
These gaps in coverage are omissions of convenience and do not take away from the text X  X  primary purpose; indeed, they allow the authors to focus more on the foundational ideas of the discipline without getting side-tracked by more specialized topics that would likely distract the text X  X  intended audience and result in a treat-ment far too cumbersome for the authors X  intentions.

The authors begin the text by offering a succinct overview of the basic ideas underlying the field of cryp-tography. The second chapter, which deals with complexity theory, provides a much more extensive analysis of its material X  X nderstandably so, once again considering the authors X  intended audience. After providing this extended introduction to modern complexity theory, the authors continue their discussion in chapters 3 and 4 by addressing some of the major problems grappled within this area. A considerable effort is made in chapter 3 explaining the P = NP question and its significance. Detailed coverage of NP-completeness,
Turing reductions and NP-hardness, and non-deterministic Turing machines are included, along with illustra-tive exercises and problems.

Chapter 4 turns the discussion to probabilistic computation. The topics of coin tossing, probabilistic Turing machines, primality testing, and circuits all figure prominently here. The discussion of the preliminaries nec-essary for proceeding with a thorough overview of the field of cryptography ends with the close of this chapter. From Chapter 5 onward, the rest of the book is devoted to a general overview of the field of cryptography.
Major topics covered include symmetric cryptosystems, one way functions, public key cryptography, digital signatures, key establishment protocols, secure encryption, and identification schemes.

Throughout the book, special emphasis is placed on the  X  X  X ig ideas X  X  in the field, the use of algorithms, and rigorous proof construction. The authors also provide a number of helpful features to assist the reader and place the content in a broader context. Numerous examples, exercises, and problems along with corresponding hints and answers to selected exercises and problems are included in two of the text X  X  six appendices. The four remaining appendices offer brief explanations of relevant mathematical areas such as graph theory, algebra and number theory, and probability theory.

These supplementary sections are quite brief and are not intended as introductions to their respective top-ics. They serve as quick rundowns of salient points in each area that are especially relevant to the material discussed in the text. Given the text X  X  intended audience, however, this approach is understandable. Most readers will already have some familiarity with the material covered here.  X  X  X urther notes X  X  sections at the end of each chapter also offer more insight into the material covered in the text and point the reader toward additional information sources. A mathematical notation key and an extensive bibliography and index are also included.

Talbot and Welsh do a commendable job of making such a complex subject accessible to a non-specialist audience. Cryptography is not the easiest area to approach for non-specialists, but the authors make the task much less daunting than it has to be. While not recommended as a comprehensive guide to the field, this clean and focused text will no doubt prove to be a valuable resource to mathematicians interested in learning more about cryptography. It will also be useful to instructors of advanced undergraduates and graduate students taking courses in complexity theory, randomness and complexity, mathematics of computer science, and re-lated courses. Talbot and Welsh have written a concise and informative text that addresses the current need for more materials dealing with cryptography from the pure mathematician X  X  perspective. References

It is not yet possible to perform transactional activities using the currently adopted mobile database frame-work, which do not allow the users to query the data on demand and achieve desired results. This book de-scribes the research work done in the field of Mobile Database Systems (MDS) where the testing of the new database transactional models for MDS is discussed in great detail.

In Mobile Database Systems , Vijay Kumar has started his book with the history and evolution of the wire-less era since the World War I to the present. He then discusses the architecture of cellular communication including Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) call processing. Kumar then introduces various database concepts and describes various database transactional models and database recovery models.
Finally, he presents various analyses of wireless broadcast modes and important protocols involved in wireless dissemination technology.

The title of the book is very catchy and self-explanatory. Overall, the book is interesting and easy to read, and the flow of the text material in the book is maintained. The naming conventions used in the chapters are easy to follow. The author intends the main audience of this book to be the people in the academy who have interests in Mobile Database Systems. The case studies and the examples discussed in a few chapters provide a good context for learners to understand the topic and its applications better.
