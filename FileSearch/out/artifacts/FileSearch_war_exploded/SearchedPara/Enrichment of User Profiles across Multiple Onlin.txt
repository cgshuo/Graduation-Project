 H.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: H.3.3 Infor-mation Search and Retrieval Volunteerism matching; Multiple sources; User profiling In modern society, volunteers act socially and economically as a work force of significant importance, without whom each society would face up with a major crisis. On the other hand, many talents are looking for appropriate volunteer op-portunities to realize their dreams of making a contribution to the society with their expertise. This is a typical supply and demand matching issue. Fortunately, user profiling and the discovery of user volunteer tendency can benefit from users X  continuous enthusiasm and active participation in di-verse online social networks (OSNs) and the huge amount of publicly available user generated contents (UGCs).
Due to the different services offered by different OSNs, people tent to simultaneously participating in multiple OSNs for different purposes. Therefore, information about a user from a single source can be relatively limited. In particular, aggregating and exploring users X  footprints casually left on all of these OSNs is a promising approach to generate more comprehensive summaries of users X  profiles [1].

The scheme of volunteerism matching consists of two main components: Volunteer Tendency Prediction and Volunteerism Matching . Currently, we are still working on the first part. We tested our scheme on the three most popular social networks: LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. The social account mapping was constructed by taking advantage of users X  explicit external social links on their About.me 1 Quora 2 profiles to their distributed profiles on multiple OSNs. In this work, we only considered users who are LinkedIn h ttps://about.me/ http://www.quora.com/ members. In particular, we harvested the form-based pro-le , content-based pro le , and social connection-based pro le for each seed user from the corresponding services. We then treat the problem of volunteer tendency prediction as a bi-nary classification task. The ground-truth for evaluation were derived from the presence of Linkedin volunteer expe-rience. In total, the gold dataset consists of 1,368 active volunteers and 4,005 ordinary people.

Based on the conceptual volunteering decision model pro-posed by Peneer et al. [2], we developed a set of features falling into four main categories: Demographic Character-istics (age, gender), Personal Attributes (user posting pat-tern, egocentric social networks), Linguistic Content (Lin-guistic Inquiry and Word Count features, topic distribution), and Social Pressure &amp; Activators (social connections X  vol-unteer tendency). Several state-of-the-art machine learn-ing classification models were investigated over these fea-tures to tackle this problem, including Support Vector Ma-chine(SVM), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) and Random Forest. The preliminary experimental results showed that integrating multiple OSN sources outperforms the use of only a single OSN source. Particularly, in terms of F1-Measure, performance can be improved by more than 20% through multiple OSN sources.

In summary, the findings of current work are expected to facilitate the detection of potential volunteer candidates with skills for social enterprise. Meanwhile, the finding of this work may give rise to concerns about privacy issue as ex-pected. Although all the experiments were conducted solely based on users X  publicly available data, people may still feel vulnerable being the subject of identities in our research. In the next phase of research, we will simultaneously work on privacy preserving technologies to allay users X  fear of being identified and targeted; and on tackling the second compo-nent of our scheme: Volunteerism Matching. We will rec-ommend a list of volunteer candidates for concrete demands based on users X  volunteer tendency and interests. However, the establishment of ground truth for next step of research would be more challenging. [1] M. Pennacchiotti and A.-M. Popescu. Democrats, [2] L. A. Penner. Volunteerism and social problems:
