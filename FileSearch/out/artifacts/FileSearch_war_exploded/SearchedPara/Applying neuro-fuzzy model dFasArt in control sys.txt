 1. Introduction
The new digital systems for monitoring and control installed in industrial processes provide  X  X  X n-line X  X  a huge amount of informa-tion from the plants, mainly coming from the sensors signals. Some of it is used in the control algorithms, but the most part of the information is often stored in historical files. Today, the computing power allows the processing of some of this data, stimulating the development of supervision applications for plant behaviour diagnosis ( Uraikul et al., 2007 ). These applications are generally based on the analysis of dynamical signals ( Jelali, 2006 ), including techniques of signal processing and pattern recognition ( Wang et al., 1999 ). The aim is to make a categorization of the plant performance which, in the process control area, could be to label the control loop behaviour as  X  X  X ormal X  X  or  X  X  X egraded X  X . The analysis must be based on the study of the signal statistics dynamics ( Hugo, 2006; Choudhury et al., 2004 ), instead of just the instantaneous signals values. Some functions as variance ( Harris et al., 1999 ), higher-order statistics ( Choudhury et al., 2004 )or spectral power ( Thornhill et al., 2002 ) and wavelets ( Chen et al., 1999 ), are proposed in the literature. These tools are also used to determine the plant-wide disturbances ( Jiang et al., 2007; Thorn-hill and Horch, 2007 ), trend detection ( Flehmig and Marquadt, 2006 ), detection of multiple oscillations ( Thornhill et al., 2003 )or et al., 1997 ) maintain the ARTMAP structure but rigorously including the principles of fuzzy sets. This allows establishing a dual vision of the model as a neural architecture and as a fuzzy logic system (FLS). At first, the FasArt/FasBack models were applied for identification and control system tasks ( Cano-Izquierdo et al., 2001; Arauzo et al., 2004 ), fault detection in AC motors ( Sainz-Palmero et al., 2005 ) and to pattern recognition problems ( Go  X  mez et al., 2001 ).

The dFasArt is born from FasArt, integrating dynamic aspects of the model equations ( Cano-Izquierdo et al., 2007a ). It can make an unsupervised classification of temporary signals using the mean values of the signals statistics instead of instantaneous ones. Some results to determine the controller performance has been exposed in Cano-Izquierdo et al. (2007b, 2009) . Also, an application to maneuver detection in road vehicles has been proposed in Toledo et al. (2010) .
 In this paper, the dFasArt architecture is presented in Section 2.
Next, three applications covering a wide range of control problems are explained. First, the focused is placed on the classification of the behaviour of sensors signals corrupted with noise and is showed in Section 3. Section 4 describes the solution of Rohrs X  X  adaptive control problem with dFasArt in a simulated example. Section 5 deals with the controller performance monitoring of a real scale plant where a digital signal processing stage, based on the autospectral density functions, is included. 2. dFasArt: dynamic FasArt model
FasArt model links the ART architecture with fuzzy logic systems, establishing a relationship between the unit activation function and the membership function of a fuzzy set. On the one hand, this allows interpreting each of the FasArt unit as a fuzzy class defined by the membership-activation function associated to the representing unit. On the other hand, the rules that relate the different classes are determined by the connection weights between the units. dFasArt uses a dynamic activation function determined by the weights of the unit as the membership function of a fuzzy set. dFasArt model is represented in Fig. 1 . The signal activation is calculated as the AND of the activations of each one of the dimensions when a multidimensional signal is considered. This
AND is implemented using the product as a T-norm. Hence, the given by dT dt  X  A T T j  X  B T where Z ji is the membership function associated to the i th-dimension of unit j , determined by the weights w ji , c ji and v ji , Input Level Category Level For the case of the uncommitted units, the class is initialized with the first categorized value, hence fast-commit ~ W J  X  ~ C 3. Clustering the behaviour of a noisy signal
A typical application of this method would be the discrimina-tion of two noisy signals with similar  X  X  X ppearance X  X  to detect changes in the sensors behaviour or in the operation states of the process outputs. Let us consider a step input signal I ( t ) with two A Gaussian noise of zero mean and variance 1 is added. The signal is sampled with a period of D t  X  0 : 001. As it is shown in Fig. 3 , it seems difficult to classify this signal as a function of the instantaneous values, even using delayed values.

To make patterns identification by means of an algorithm of type k-means, it is necessary to consider all the data set and the number of classes to be used (two classes in this case). So, the I (t) C 4. Application of dFastArt to Rohrs X  X  problem
The dFasArt ability to categorize operational states can be used to analyze the behaviour of controlled systems, by examining its error controller X  X  behaviour and  X  X  X ar ning X  X  if there are significant variations in it. This can be used, for example, to determine the necessity to carry out an adaptation in the controller parameters. 4.1. Simulation study
The well-known Rohrs X  X  example shows how an adaptive system can lose stability due to the presence of both noise in the r ( t ) e ( t ) d ^ a r  X  t  X  dt  X 
The stability properties of the previous algorithm have been studied in Peterson and Narendra (1982) . The system performance becomes strongly dependent of the D value because it only manage instantaneous values of the error signal. This could generate a continuous on X  X ff of the adaptation mechanism. A possible solution is distinguishing between the state in which is necessary to adapt the parameters and another where it is not. This decision should be based on the  X  X  X endency X  X  of data statistics instead of just on the instantaneous value. It would increase the system autonomy following Narendra X  X  guideline: learning essential information about predictable unpredictable situations null, the error state identified at the first time interval could be labeled as  X  X  X ormal operational state X  X  and therefore the adapta-tion in the controller X  X  parameters is not necessary. This state will shown in Fig. 10 . The change in the reference at t  X  10 causes a change in the statistics features of the error. This generates the activation of a new unit in dFasArt, J  X  2, as it is shown in the same figure. This unit represents the necessity to carry out an adaptation in the controller X  X  parameters. When the adaptation is activated, the error is again categorized in the unit J  X  1 and that means that it is no longer necessary to continue with the 4.2. Parameter drift in DC motor adaptive control
The previous case is applied to a laboratory DC motor ( Fig. 13 ) to achieve a desired angular position with a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC).

The second order approximation  X  Y m  X  s  X  X  to a step set-point ( R ( s )) has been considered as the reference to be followed: Y m  X  s  X 
R  X  s  X   X 
The operation state has been considered as  X  X  X uitable X  X  when the error is within the category (ZE) described by the narrow fuzzy set of Fig. 14 .

The MRAC scheme is the proposed in Slotine and Li (1991) u  X  ^ a 2  X   X  Y m b 1 _ e b 0 e  X  X  ^ a 1 _ Y  X  ^ a 0 Y  X  13  X  where the error e  X  t  X  X  Y m Y .
 The parameters of the control law  X  ^ a i  X  t  X  X  are calculated as in Slotine and Li (1991) .

Fig. 15 (a) shows how at the beginning the controller provides good tracking of the reference, but the performance is getting damaged with time. This effect is attributed to a phenomenon analogous to the parameter drift that causes the motor to behave in a bang X  X ang mode, as seen in Fig. 15 (b). dFasArt supervise the parameters adaptation law as can be seen in the proposed scheme of Fig. 16 . dFasArt module allows the adaptation to run when the error is classified in a different category than the  X  X  X uitable X  X  one. Fig. 17 shows an improved performance because the adaptation is just made in the initial cycles. 5. Control loop assessment and diagnosis
In control engineering, the closed-loop is the most frequently used control scheme. Significant advances have been achieved in the design of controllers with new control strategies, but there are not many works dealing with the tracking of the controllers performance ( Harris et al., 1999; Rossi and Scali, 2005 ). What does it happens during the working life of the controller? Is there a degradation on its performance or is it maintained similar? How does the controller react to unmeasured disturbances not taken into account at the design stage?
To answer these questions, tools are required to analyze the system behaviour in closed-loop and to represent it by means of a set of characteristics whose evolution could be compared and classified in a temporal way.

In this section, a method to determine the controller performance is proposed. The aim is to transform the temporal information contained into the error signal in a spatial vector using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques, which has also a temporal character because it is calculated for several time intervals. The dFasArt model will make a classification of the spatial-temporal vector. It allows distinguishing between differ-ent operational states associated to the behaviour of the closed-loop system. 5.1. Digital signal processing
To represent a sample record, some statistical properties can be used: mean and mean square values, probability density functions, autocorrelation functions or autospectral density functions. Spectral density function is suitable to determine the the autocorrelation function coefficients carried out as follows: ^ R  X  ^ R  X  rh  X  X  with r  X  0,1, y , m where m is the maximum lag number must be small compared to the number of considered samples ( N ).
The leakage reduction is used to achieve a smooth estimation of the power spectral density. It calculates the estimate harmonic ^ G k corresponding to the frequency f  X  kf c = m with k  X  0,1, y , m . ^ G  X  0 : 5 ~ G 0  X  0 : 5 ~ G 1 ^ G ^ G m  X  0 : 5 ~ G m 1  X  0 : 5 ~ G m  X  16  X 
With this processing, the temporal signal for the considered window can be represented through a spatial vector. These vectors constitute a new temporal signal which can be classified measured by the sensor and ref is the reference. The sample time is selected to D t  X  0 : 33 seg :
The reference of the ball altitude is maintained constant while some changes have been done in the controller parameters as presented in Table 1 , where each set of parameters corresponds to an operating state of the plant. Fig. 19 shows the tracking error signal e [ k ] along the experiment.

A sliding window of 200 samples is defined over the temporal error signal. With the selected sample time, the window corresponds to an interval of 66 seg. ,asshownin Fig. 20 . The window is moved in steps of 10 samples (3.3 seg. ). The error signal for each window is processed with the digital processi ng method described in Section 5.1, considering 10 frequencies for the calculus of the autospectral density function. Thus, a 10-dimensional temporal vector is obtained and be seen the temporal evolution of the signal power-spectrum according to the changes in the controller parameters. For the learning task with dFasArt, the parameters: A w  X  0.01,
A
A  X  0.02 are selected. Fig. 22 shows dFasArt output corresponding to the winning unit J . As it can be seen, four units have been committed, the units 1 and 2 correspond to the first state (first set of controller parameters), the unit 3 fits the second state and unit 4 corresponds to the third one.

In the second part of the experiment, the reference is also maintained constant with the same sets of controller parameters, but now the working order of these sets has been changed, as 6. Conclusions
This paper presents the algorithm of the neuro-fuzzy dFasArt model as an alternative for the classification of temporal signals. The clustering is made according to the statistics features of the signal in an incremental way, so it does not need a buffer of historical data. The fuzzy character of the categories defined by dFasArt allows working with data with uncertainty and its neural network structure makes possible a self-organization that mini-mizes the need of previous knowledge about the problem.
To illustrate dFasArt capabilities, three applications in the control systems field have been carried out. The first one deals with the discrimination of noisy signals. In the second one, the dFasArt module studies the behaviour of closed-loop control systems and provides some knowledge about their operational states. This has been used to activate or to cancel the parameters adaptation in a classic adaptive control scheme (Rohr X  X  problem). dFasArt decides when the controller performance is not adequate and so the adaptation must be activated, avoiding the over-learning problems of parameter drift in Rohr X  X  example. Both, simulated and real case have been shown.

The third application has been made with a laboratory scale plant, showing the feasibility of the proposed architecture for the performance monitoring of the controller. The frequency analysis of the error signal with DSP and the non-supervised classification with dFasArt, allows detecting the operational states of the closed-loop controlled system. Even in the presence of an error signal corrupted with noise.

The good results confirm the dFasArt model as a suitable tool to controller performance assessment. It offers a realistic  X  X  X n-line X  X  classification of the operational states, just analyzing the error signal and without interfering the process, which is attractive for industrial applications already running.
