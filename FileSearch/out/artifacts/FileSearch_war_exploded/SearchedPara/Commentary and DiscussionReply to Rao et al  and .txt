Center for Spoken Language Understanding 1. Introduction
In the last issue of this journal, I presented a piece that called into question some of the techniques reported in two papers in high-profile journals that purported to provide statistical evidence for the linguistic status of some ancient symbol systems (Sproat 2010a).
 m yclaims, and have requested the opportunit yto respond. The two responses, taken together, are rather length yand as a result it is not possible, given limitations of space, for me to address each and ever yone of their criticisms. I will therefore focus on what I consider to be the most important objections. 2. Rao et al. X  X  Response
The essential claim of Rao and his colleagues (henceforth  X  X ao X ) is that I have misrep-resented the claims of Rao et al. (2009), and painted an incomplete picture of their work.
The yalso take the opportunit yto discuss at some length a wide range of evidence that the yfeel supports the Indus script h ypothesis.
 that appeared in Science in 2009. Although I mentioned some of Rao X  X  later work, it was not a critique of that later work. It seemed reasonable to assume that the paper in Science was intended to be taken seriousl yand to stand on its own merits. If so, then I felt X  and still feel X  X hat the paper had serious problems. A problematic paper that cannot stand on its own does not become unproblematic even if subsequent research were to show the conclusions to be correct. To give a stark example, if someone should even-tuall ydemonstrate rigorousl ythat cottontop tamarins are capable of learning  X  X egular X  grammars, that would have no bearing on the questions currentl ysurrounding Marc Hauser X  X  2002 publication in Cognition (Johnson 2010).

Linguistics as a forum for promoting the non-script theor yfor the Indus. Indeed I spent exactl yone short paragraph on this, where I discussed our work in Farmer, Sproat, and
Witzel (2004) as a wa yof setting the stage for the current discussion. In contrast, Rao spends a significant portion of his response discussing the Indus symbols, the case for the script theory, and the case against the non-script theory, and repeatedly refers to our 2004 paper and claimed problems with our arguments. The desire to keep m ydiscussion of the background short was what prompted me not to expand on m yclaim that our arguments had  X  X een accepted b yman yarchaeologists and linguists. X  Rao notes that I do not actuall ycite  X  X ho these  X  X an yarchaeologists and linguists X  are. X  Perhaps the y do not exist? But the ydo: Andrew Lawler, a science reporter who in 2004 interviewed a large number of people on both sides of the debate notes that  X  X an yothers are convinced that Farmer, Witzel, and Sproat have found a wa yto move awa yfrom sterile discussions of decipherment, and the yfind few flaws in their arguments X  (Lawler 2004, page 2029), and quotes the Sanskrit scholar George Thompson and University of Pennsylvania Professor Emeritus of Indian studies Frank Southworth. 2.1 Misunderstandings about Nonlinguistic Symbols
A large part of the discussion in Rao X  X  response centers, as it should, on the question of the  X  X ype 1 X  (random) and  X  X ype 2 X  (rigidly ordered) models, which I argued did not accurately characterize any nonlinguistic symbol systems. At the core of this debate is the Old European sign system of the Vin  X  ca, which is claimed to be a good instance of Type 1, and the Mesopotamian deity symbols found on kudurru stones, which are claimed to be good instances of Type 2.
 notes that the signs do not seem to have an yordering, and are  X  X haracteristicall y disarranged. X  But if one sees the broader context of this quote, it becomes clear that
Winn is talking here about a subset of the corpus, which is found on small vessels and spindle whorls. He contrasts the inscriptions discussed in the quote given by
Rao with  X  X he more arranged format of tablets and seals X  (page 270), and then again (page 276) where he notes that  X  X d]ifferences in complexit yof sign usage is denoted b ysign ordering, which occurs on tablets and other objects, such as the plaque from
Grade  X  snica. X  On page 263 he refers to the  X  X iscover yof tablets with script-like content at Tartaria in 1961, X  a clear indicator that the Vin  X  ca tablets would seem to involve some form of sign ordering. It is clear then, that Winn is not saying that the system is in general unordered, onl ythat a subset of the corpus is. Winn also suggests that the small vessels in particular probabl yhad a ritualistic function (page 276). Furthermore, the text that was ellipted in Rao X  X  quote suggests that order was probabl yunimportant on the spindle whorls  X  X ince concepts or mnemonic aids could be inferred or interpreted b yan individual cognizant of the culture-specific content of the signs X  (page 269), suggesting a situation where the Vin  X  ca  X  X eader X  could interpret the jumbled signs since the yknew the structure of the s ystem. It is unfortunate that most of Winn X  X  interesting work has been published in obscure locations, and is therefore not something the average reader would run across. Fortunatel ythough, Winn maintains a Web page at http://www.prehistory.it/ftp/winn.htm , where one can see what the sign texts look like and where Winn also notes (page 8) that  X  X he distinction between signs on pottery and the more organized signs on tablets and other artifacts ma ysignif yfunctional differences or different levels of usage and formality. X  without structure. But suppose, counterfactually, it did. Would Rao et al. X  X   X  X ype 1 X  be a good model of the system? Their Type 1 data is modeled by a random process that generates texts  X  X ased on the assumption that each sign has an equal probabilit yof fol-lowing an yother X  (Rao et al. 2009, Supplement, page 2), or in other words a s ystem that is random and equiprobable. But where does Winn sa ythat the s ystem is equiprobable ?
The most Rao X  X  excerpted quote could be taken to mean is that the system is random, but Winn certainl ydoes not sa ythat the signs occur with equal frequenc y. A much more 808 plausible model of a random ancient sign system would be one where the symbols have a non-equiprobable distribution: as I argued in m yarticle  X  X  ymbols represent things, and the things the yrepresent t ypicall ydo not occur with equal probabilit y. X  Further, we know that man ythings, from nonlinguistic s ystems such as kudurrus (see the following) to populations of sets of species, have a Zipfian distribution, so a reasonable model of such a system might well be one in which the unigram probability follows a Zipf-
Mandelbrot distribution. But to have presented Type 1 in this way would have been problematic: As I discussed in m ypiece, such random texts easil y X  X ool X  the bigram conditional entrop ymeasure that Rao et al. proposed in their Science paper. Rao objects to the statement in m ypiece that at least some of the discussion surrounding their paper depends on the confusion between  X  X andom X  and  X  X andom and equiprobable, X  deeming that statement  X  X nwarranted and not worth yof comment. X  Yet their model of Vin  X  ca as a random equiprobable system depends precisely on this confusion. of Type 2, a rigidly ordered system. In support, Rao quotes Slanski (2003), who says  X  X o a certain extent, the divine symbols were deployed upon the Entitlement nar  X  us (kudurrus) according to the deities X  relative positions in the pantheon. The symbols for the higher gods of the pantheon...are g enerall yfound upon or toward the top and most prominent part of the monument. X  Crucial phrases here are  X  X o a certain extent X  X nd X  X hesymbolsforthehighergods...areg enerall yfound. X  No doubt these are partl ytrue; indeed it is ver yoften true that the  X  X un disk, X   X  X rescent moon, X  and  X  X tar X  symbols occur at the beginnings of texts X  X hough ordering within those three varies. But the kudurru texts are still far from rigid, as we showed in Farmer, Sproat, and
Witzel (2004) and as m yown sample from Seidl shows. Over and above this, the quoted excerpts would onl yseem to support a hierarch y, not a model  X  X ased on the assumption that each sign has a unique successor sign X  or even one where based on  X  X ariations of this theme where each sign could be followed by, for example, 2 or 3 other signs X  (Rao et al. 2009, Supplement, page 3). All the hierarch yimplies is that a s ymbol Y that is lower on the hierarch yshould come after a s ymbol X that is higher on the hierarchy.
But for an ygiven X there ma ybe several s ymbols lower on the hierarch y, which means that X could be followed directl yb yan yof these, assuming that no concepts from the intervening elements are  X  X entioned X  in the  X  X ext. X  m yclose examination of the kudurru corpus, Rao still suggests that  X  X e expect the entrop yof the kudurru sequences to be lower than linguistic systems and perhaps slightl yabove the minimum entrop y(Min Ent) range in Figure 1(b). X  Surel yone would like to examine the data and see whether such a statement is likel yto be supported.
In an ycase there seems to be little point in arguing about this. I have the data for the kudurrus that I transcribed from Seidl and I will be happ yto make them available to anyone who wants them. As the reader will have seen in Lee et al. X  X  reply, and as I discuss in Section 3, Lee et al. took a different attitude to the deit ys ymbols than Rao has. Rather than argue from  X  X irst principles X  about what the corpus might look like, the yactuall ywent to the trouble of replicating m yexperiment and developed their own corpus from Seidl X  X  work (Rob Lee, personal communication): The yconcluded that b y their measures kudurrus would also count as (logographic) writing (an issue I get back to subsequently) X  X uggesting a much less rigid ordering than Rao et al. seem to believe. situation in linguistic systems, which  X  X ave no such hierarchy imposed on characters or words. X  Interestingly, although this is generally true, there are pockets of such hierarchies that do occur in language. A good example is from Egyptian (Allen 2000), where there is a hierarch ythat determines the order in which terms denoting human or divine entities are written. Thus terms for gods will occur in writing before terms for humans or other things, even if the divine terms would be spoken after the other terms.
This occurs a lot in royal names, so that for example Tutankhamen , whose name means  X  X iving image of Amen X , is written in cartouches with the god Amen X  X  name first. a point that Rao seems to be calling into question. As a minor point, the yobject to m yuse of Bo yScout merit badges and highwa ysigns as relevant to the discussion, inviting the reader to examine these and see  X  X hether such a comparison bears merit. X 
Unfortunatel ythis is due to a misinterpretation of what I meant b ythese comparisons, and it is perfectl ypossible that I did not explain m ypoint well enough. I was not discussing the forms of the individual signs, but rather the fact that for merit badges and highwa ysigns the s ymbols can be combined into  X  X exts X  that are invariabl ylinearl y arranged. Bo yScout badges are worn on sashes, where the yare neatl yarranged in rows.
Informational highwa ysigns, such as indicators for gas stations, accommodations, and food, frequentl yoccur together and when the ydo the yare arranged linearl y. Of course the individual signs are not linearl ycomposed an ymore than the Indus s ymbols are linearl ycomposed or, in general, the basic s ymbols in an yscript.

Rao et al. (2009) would have to have compared a wider set of linguistic and nonlinguistic systems, but I also suggested this would depend upon having a good set of corpora for real nonlinguistic systems, something which I claimed nobody has done the legwork of compiling. Rao claims that this ignores the work of Vidale (2007), who included a description of ten ancient South Asian nonlinguistic systems in his rebuttal to Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel (2004). This is misleading at best. If the reader will care to reread what
I said in m yarticle, it is clear that what I meant was that electronic corpora do not exist on which one could carr yout the kinds of statistical tests that Rao and colleagues wish to perform. I believe that remains true. Vidale does indeed discuss ten systems, discusses their distribution and use, and lists numbers of signs in each. But b y X  X egwork, X  I was not referring to discussion of such systems, but rather the development of corpora of such systems whereby one could actually perform serious statistical analyses and compare among a range of linguistic and nonlinguistic systems. As far as I am aware, there is no such set of corpora. As Rao highlights, Vidale notes the  X  X ystematic, large-scale redundancy X  of symbol distributions of some of the systems he examines. Perhaps, but as we have seen in the discussion of Vin  X  ca symbols and kudurrus earlier, translating such broad statements into precise statistical characterizations of the kind necessar yfor Rao X  X  methods is trick yat best.
 signs in the systems he examines is 44,  X  X  far cry from the 400 or so signs in the Indus script. X  To that statistic one could add kudurru symbols, which number about 60 in
Seidl X  X  (1989) catalog. In fact, Vidale challenges Farmer, Witzel and me to  X  X dentify another South Asian system datable to the 3rd millennium B.C. of nonlinguistic signs amounting to 400 basic signs or more X  (page 344). Nonlinguistic systems with hundreds of s ymbols certainl yexist: heraldr y(where the sign set is open-ended; see an ytext on heraldr ysuch as Slater [2002]) would be one such example, though of course that does not meet the time and space restrictions required b yVidale. But then, what is the basis of those restrictions? A symbol system has as many symbols as it needs. Chinese writing has thousands of characters because it has chosen to represent linguistic units at the level of the morpheme; the Greek alphabet is much smaller due to its decision to repre-sent phonemic segments. If the Indus symbols are nonlinguistic, then the vocabulary 810 size of over 400 symbols would merely reflect that it represented a rich underlying set of concepts. Proponents of the script thesis always like to discuss the advanced state of Indus civilization, arguing that such an advanced civilization could easil yhave invented writing, and would be hard pressed to do without it. The Indus certainl ywas one of the most advanced civilizations of the third millenium BCE: Would it therefore not be reasonable to suppose that the ycould have invented a rich nonlinguistic s ymbol system, even if their less advanced neighbors could not? the objection to the use of artificial data sets as  X  X  red herring X  that  X  X oes not change the result that the Indus script is entropicall ysimilar to linguistic scripts. X  But within the first two paragraphs of the Science paper, Rao et al. state:  X  X e compared the statistical structure of sequences of signs in the Indus script with those from a representative group of linguistic and nonlinguistic systems. Two major types of nonlinguistic systems are those that do not exhibit much sequential structure (type 1 systems) and those that follow rigid sequential order (type 2 systems). X  These (artificial) systems are clearly central to their argument yet, as I have argued, the yare poor models of an yrelevant nonlinguistic system. Objections hardly seem to constitute a red herring.

Science paper, nowhere do I discuss their Figure 1B, nor do I do more than mention their later work. On the latter point, let me reiterate: M yarticle was about the paper that appeared in Science , not an ylater work. I was not, for example, making an yclaims about the block entrop ycalculations in Rao (2010): I simpl yhave not anal yzed those. But as I said, I assume that at the point the Science paper appeared, the methods proposed were intended to be taken seriousl yon their own, and the evidence presented was intended to be taken to support those methods. It is therefore perfectl yreasonable for me to have failed to discuss later work. What about Figure 1B? It is true that I did not present this figure, which shows high entrop yfor DNA and proteins, includes Sanskrit among the linguistic examples, and shows that Fortran has a somewhat lower entrop ythan the natural language samples the yinclude. M yquestion about DNA and proteins would be: Wh yare these relevant? Although the yare possibl y X  X he two  X  X ost ancient X  non-linguistic systems, X  the topic of discussion surely is symbol systems that were products of the human mind.
 me is wh yFortran was not included in Figure 1A: Wh ydid Rao and colleagues not show the entrop ygrowth curve for Fortran in 1A, as Rao (2010) did and as the yalso show in their Figure 1(b) in their response? I suspect I know: Using their original bigram conditional entrop ymeasure, Figure 1A, Fortran would have shown a growth curve that overlapped significantl ywith the linguistic s ystems, compromising the visual impact of the plot. But I had no direct evidence for this, so rather than speculate in m ypiece (as I have here), I preferred to omit discussion. Unlike Rao, I did not view their Figure 1B as including crucial data that I was somehow hiding.
 leaves one wondering: Fortran is lower than their linguistic examples, but not much lower. The same is true of the Figure 1B in their Science paper. How would one expect the plot to look if the yhad included a larger range of languages and text t ypes? I return to this point subsequently.
 like DNA and protein, is ver yclose to the maximum entrop ycurve. The ylater criticize me for ignoring  X  X he fact that the results alread yinclude nonlinguistic s ystems: DNA and protein sequences...as well as man-made sequences (Fortran code and music in
Figure 1[b]). X  DNA, protein, and Fortran we have just discussed. It seems odd to accuse me of ignoring the case of music, as that data did not appear at all in the Science paper; indeed it did not appear in Rao (2010), where he first introduced the block entropy calculations. It would have required unusual prescience on m ypart to discuss data that, until now, have not appeared in print.
 a point of enumerating the list of properties that the ydeem relevant for considering the linguistic status of the Indus symbols. This is of course related to the issue of how to interpret the claims of their work, which we take up in Section 2.2. Rather than enumerate the properties the ydescribe, I will simpl ypresent the script-like properties of another system, namely, the Mesopotamian deity symbols, a system we know was not linguistic. I also made some of these points, but more briefly, in my piece: (1) Deity s ymbols are frequentl ylinearl ywritten and in the cases where linearit yis less clear, the symbols are written around the top of a stone in an apparent concentric circle pattern (see examples in Seidl [1989]). One sees such non-linear arrangements with scripts too:
The Etruscan Magliano disk, and man yrune stones, have text wrapped around the border of the stone. (2) There is clear evidence for the directionalit yof deit ys ymbols: To the extent that  X  X ore important X  gods were depicted first, these occur at the left/top of the text. (3) Deity symbols are often ligatured together: One symbol may be joined with another. (4) The deit ys ymbols obe ya Zipfian distribution. (5) Deit ys ymbols clearl y have language-like properties in that certain symbols display positional preference (symbols for the more important gods coming earlier in the text), and certain glyphs have an affinit yfor each other X  X or example, some gl yphs such as the  X  X orned crown X  seem to like to be joined together with the  X  X ymbol base. X  (6) Deity symbols were used largel yon standing stones, but were also used in other contexts such as the  X  X ecklace X  depicted in the A  X  s  X  surnas . irpal II bas relief shown in m ypiece. (7) Deit ys ymbols are pictographic, like many real scripts X  X gyptian, Luwian, Mayan. This would seem like a fairl ycompelling list of script-like properties: Contrar yto what Rao suggests, it is certainly possible to find very script-like nonlinguistic symbol systems. 2.2 Misunderstandings about Claims
Rao, in the response to m yarticle, as well as elsewhere, makes the point that nowhere do the yclaim that the conditional entrop ymeasure(s) are sufficient b ythemselves to demonstrate that the Indus symbols were linguistic. Indeed they do not. The last sentence of the Science article reads:  X  X iven the prior evidence for syntactic structure in the Indus script, our results increase the probabilit ythat the script represents language, complementing other arguments that have been made explicitl yor implicitl yin favor of the linguistic hypothesis. X  colleagues make the claim that conditional entrop ysettles the matter X  X hough it is surel ytrue that this was the wa yman ypeople interpreted their results. The question is, how is one supposed to interpret their claim that their results  X  X ncrease the probability that the script represents language X ? I can think of three possible interpretations. One is as a loose general statement to the effect that there is alread ylots of evidence for the script thesis, and this additional piece of evidence adds to that body.
 are assuming some sort of  X  X eductive X  model whereb yfor a set of features F computing the probabilit yof the linguistic h ypothesis ( H 812 hypothesis ( H NL ), given these features. Implicitl ythen, we are combining the features into a classifier that computes P ( H L | F i ) versus P ( H an overall prediction. It is worth noting that Lee et al. X  X  paper does indeed use the statistical measures Lee and colleagues develop in this deductive sense.
 which he claims is the  X  X orrect X  wa yto interpret their work. In that interpretation, a set of feature values are observed, and the task is to induce which of two underlying models X  H L or H NL  X  X s the one likel yto have generated the observation. The reader will surel yrecognize that the second and third interpretations correspond prett ydirectl yto discriminative versus generative models. Both of these approaches are used in a variety of classification tasks, and both are perfectl ylegitimate wa ys to view the problem.
The choice of the generative model as the correct interpretation of their work, and its formalization as the yhave given it in their response to m ypiece, is the first time this particular interpretation has been explicitl ystated. At the ver yleast, if the yhad wanted people to understand this point, it would have been good to make it clear at the outset b ystating the model in the Science paper. One can hardl yfault critics for misunderstanding which of two equall yviable interpretations was the one intended. the ydo claim, under the various interpretations? Do m ycriticisms, as Rao would claim, miss the point? Am I building straw men and destroying them? I do not think so. Under the  X  X eductive X  interpretation m ycritiques would appear to be highl yrelevant. I argue, for example, that a memoryless random process with a non-equiprobable unigram distribution is classified as  X  X inguistic X  b ythe bigram conditional entrop yfeature from the Science paper. 1 This implies that there are distributions that are misclassified b ythe feature. How man ysuch misclassified s ystems are there among plausible nonlinguistic symbol systems? We do not know, because Rao et al. did not do a fair comparison of a wide range of linguistic and nonlinguistic systems, and demonstrate statistically how well the classifier works. So we do not know whether in fact this feature  X  X ncreases the probability X  of the Indus symbols being a linguistic script. Needless to say, this problem with the deductive interpretation also implies the identical problem with the looser first interpretation I outlined above.
 we need to consider the probabilit yof observing a feature, given one of the two h y-potheses. For some features, such as the feature of linear arrangements of symbols, it seems plausible that one has a higher expectation of seeing linearl yarranged s ymbols on the hypothesis that something is a true script, compared with the hypothesis of a nonlinguistic system. For bigram conditional entropy, again we really do not know.
Again, not enough examples of human-created nonlinguistic systems were presented in the Science paper to be able to estimate the probabilities. And there is another issue:
None of Rao and colleagues X  work provides a statistical measure b ywhich one can as-sert that something is inside the  X  X inguistic X  range. Rather, the ypresent plots and invite the reader to eyeball them, hardly a rigorous demonstration. As I noted herein, Fortran does not appear to have a conditional entrop ythat is much lower than the linguistic examples. What would one expect the  X  X inguistic range X  to look like if a larger number of languages were included and, equall yimportantl y, a variet yof genres ranging from prose, to poetry, to genealogies, to grafitti, to shopping lists? Again, we do not know, so it is rather hard to evaluate the claim that for this feature P ( F needs to meet certain criteria. When one proposes a new feature, one must demonstrate that this feature adds information, and increases the discriminative power of one X  X  model. I do not believe Rao et al. X  X  paper in Science does this. And as we have already noted, given several plausible interpretations of what one is trying to demonstrate, it is usuall ybest if one makes it clear at the outset what one means.
 to which the Indus symbols look linguistic. But one can surely add to their list: Suppose one considered features like  X  X s onl yused to write ver yshort texts X  or  X  X ccurs in a culture where there are no archaeological markers of manuscript production X  (Farmer,
Sproat, and Witzel 2004)? Then the script thesis would not fare so well. As for Rao X  X  claim that the prior probability P ( H L ) X  X he a priori probabilit yof the linguistic h ypoth-esis being true X  X s  X  X igher than chance, X  and the archaeological support for that claim, I will have to pass over that point for lack of space. The interested reader ma ylook at
Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel (2004), and the responses of our critics such as Vidale (2007), and decide for themselves who makes the more convincing case. 2.3 Computational Linguistics, Decipherment, and the Wider World
Rao concludes b yciting the impressive achievements of computational linguistics as a field, and some of the important contributions to decipherment that work in the field has afforded. The yquestion m yh ypothesis that the editors of prominent science journals ma ynot  X  X ven know that there are people who spend their lives doing statistical and computational analyses of text, X  and claim that  X  X s]uch a statement fails to acknowledge both the impressive achievements of the field of computational linguistics in recent years and the wide coverage of these accomplishments in the popular press. X  to them in the conclusion of my piece. I was trying to hypothesize why, apparently, computational linguists were not asked to review the Science piece b yRao (or the Lee et al. piece in Proceedings of the Royal Society ). It is entirel ypossible m yh ypothesis here is wrong and that the editors of, say, Science are well aware of computational linguistics as a field. That just makes this apparent oversight all the more disturbing. niques to ancient scripts. M ypoint, clearl y, was not to claim that such work in general is a  X  X isuse X  of the methods of computational linguistics, as Rao seems to be implying
I do. I was rather focussing on two specific papers, the one published in Science ,andthe one in the Proceedings of the Royal Society , to which I now turn. 3. Lee et al. X  X  Response
Lee et al. X  X  response (henceforth  X  X ee X ) is much shorter than Rao et al. X  X , and boils down essentiall yto two points. The first point is that one can use randomizations of a given corpus, compare the bigram conditional entropies of those randomized corpora to the conditional entropies of the original, and see if the true conditional entrop yis uniforml ysmaller than an yof the values computed from randomized corpora. For 80% of script examples, and for the Pictish symbols, Lee found that this was the case. For sets that were generated b yrandom processes, the distribution of  X  X rue X  entrop yvis-` a-vis 814 randomized entrop ywas more uniform. This method seems to make sense as a wa y to spot memoryless non-equiprobable processes masquerading as structured systems, such as the example of successive tosses of seven six-sided dice I discussed in m ypiece.
But this was not part of the methodolog ypresented in the published paper b yLee, which as I showed is fooled b ysuch processes. Furthermore, it would still fail to spot nonlinguistic systems that have structure, such as Mesopotamian deity symbols. that texts from kudurrus look linguistic, noting that the values that I calculate  X  X or the kudurrus data set places them in a similar level of communication X  to Pictish symbols.
For them this is an acceptable result, and comes down to a  X  X ifference in viewpoint over terminolog yas to the definition of what constitutes  X  X riting X , X  noting that I use a  X  X tricter definition of writing than some other researchers, such as Powell (2009). X 
The yquote Powell as stating that  X  X riting is a s ystem of markings with a conventional reference that communicates information. X  There is no doubt that some students of writing systems have indeed adopted a broader definition of writing than that which
I assume. But these are b yno means majorit yviews. The problem with the broader view expressed b ythe quoted sentence from Powell is that it would seem to classif y as writing any meaningful conventionalized symbol system. Mathematical equations, dance notation, music, and (pace Lee et al.) European heraldr ywould all count as writing from that standpoint. After all, all of these are systems of markings, with conventional reference, that communicate information. It is hard to believe that Powell himself reall ywants this broad a definition: The subtitle of his book is  X  X heor yand His-tor yof the Technolog yof Civilization. X  Although nonlinguistic notation s ystems such as mathematics have been central in the histor yof the world, I submit that what makes writing work as the  X  X echnolog yof civilization X  is precisel ythat it allows us to record language (see Sproat 2010b). In an yevent if that is the breadth that Lee wants, then certainly Pictish symbols (and Mesopotamian deity symbols) are writing, because they are conventional systems of marks that (presumably) communicated information. But the broader definition is also highl ymisleading. When la ypeople think of writing the y will undoubtedl ythink of the script and standard orthograph ythe ylearned in school, which allows them to write anything from letters, to shopping lists, to poetry, to journal articles. Calling Pictish symbols  X  X riting X  easily conjures up in the mind of the reader the notion that such symbols could have been used by the Picts for writing treatises on iron smelting techniques. No doubt Lee did not intend this interpretation, but once one calls something  X  X riting X  or  X  X anguage X  this seems to be a natural consequence. In any case the broad definition of writing Lee wants to assume reduces the claim that Pictish symbols encode  X  X anguage X  to near vacuity: Nobody ever doubted that the symbols conveyed information of some kind. 4. Conclusion
It has been a useful exercise to read Rao et al. X  X  and Lee et al. X  X  responses, because this has forced me to think even deeper about the issues than I had alread ydone. I believe m ybasic criticisms are still valid.
