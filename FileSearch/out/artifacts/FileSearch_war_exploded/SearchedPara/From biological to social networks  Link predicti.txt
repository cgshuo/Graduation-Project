 1. Introduction
Online social networks (OSNs) such as Facebook.com, 1 Myspace, make predictions about who is a friend of whom. OSNs gather information on users' social contacts, construct a large interconnected social network, and recommend other people to users based on the network structure. Link Prediction in social example of a local approach, as shown in Fig. 1 , Facebook.com or Hi5.com uses the following style of recommendation for recommending new friends to a target user U 1 :  X  People you may know: (i) user U
U , U 6 , and U 10 ) (ii) user U 4 because you have two common friends (users U with the target user.

Moreover, inspired from the recent surge of research on large, complex networks and their properties, we also study protein protein interaction networks (PPINs)  X  structures whose nodes represent proteins and whose edges represent interaction, or influence between them. Interactions between proteins are important for numerous example from the area of biology, signals from the exterior of a cell are mediated to the inside of that cell by protein spectral clustering analysis.

In this paper, we provide link predictions in both OSNs and PPINs, by performing multi-way spectral clustering , which uses partition of the data.
 Compared to approaches based on local features of a network (i.e. Common Neighbors index or else known as FOAF algorithm,
Adamic/Adar index, Jaccard Coefficient, etc.  X  for more details see Related work section), we provide link predictions, by results to lower accuracy prediction as will be shown experimentally later.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the related work, whereas Section 3 briefly reviews preliminaries in graphs employed in our approach.

Common Neighbors index, also known as Friend of a Friend algorithm (FOAF) [6] , is adopted by many popular OSNs, such as facebook.com and hi5.com for the friend recommendation task. FOAF is based on the common sense that two nodes v likely to form a link in the future, if they have many common neighbors. In addition to FOAF algorithm, there are also more similarity metric in Information Retrieval.

The novelty of our new proposed method compared to existing approaches is as follows:  X 
Recently, extensive empirical analysis has demonstrated that FOAF [6] algorithm, performs better than other complicated variants [25,49] such as Adamic/Adar index and Jaccard Coefficient. Thus, we compare our method against FOAF algorithm as representative of the local-based measures, and as will be experimentally shown later, our method outperforms FOAF algorithm in terms of accuracy.  X 
In contrast to global algorithms, such as the Katz index [17] and the Random Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm [33], our method is more efficient. This means that our method, which is based on the top few eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian matrix, requires less time and space complexity than global algorithms. We compare our method against
RWR, as representatives of the global algorithms, and as will be shown experimentally later, our method outperforms RWR in terms of accuracy and time complexity.  X  better friend recommendations and protein link predictions. We have compared our method against k -means, as representative of the clustering algorithms, and as will be shown experimentally later, our method is more effective than k -means.
Besides the aforementioned link prediction algorithms that are based solely on the graph structure, there are alternative
Guy et al. [12], proposed a novel user interface widget for providing users with recommendations of people. Their people recommendations were based on aggregated information collected from various sources across IBM organization (i.e. common tagging, common link structure, common co-authored papers etc.). Chen et al. [6] evaluated four recommender algorithms (Content Matching, Content-plus-Link, FOAF algorithm and, SONAR) to help users discover new friends on IBM's OSN. TidalTrust only on predictions based on the link structure of an OSN and a PPIN and thus, we will exclude them from our experimental comparison. 3. Preliminaries in graphs among proteins of a PPIN and will be used as our running example, throughout the paper. Notice that our running example concerns a friendship network.

The adjacency matrix A of graph G is a matrix with rows and columns labeled by graph vertices, with a 1 or 0 in position ( v dimensionality and sparsity.

The spectral algorithms are based on eigenvectors of Laplacians, which are a combination of the adjacency and the degree matrix. The normalized Laplacian matrix of graph G is computed by equation L X D 0=  X  1  X  ...  X   X  n . Moreover, the number of 0 eigenvalues equals the number of the connected components in a graph. Table 2 presents the most important symbols and their corresponding definitions, which are used frequently in the sequel. 4. The proposed approach
In this section, through a motivating example we first provide the outline of our approach, named SpectralLink. Next, we analyze the steps of the proposed algorithm. 4.1. Outline
Here, we describe how SpectralLink is applied on OSNs/PPINs and how the link prediction is performed according to the detected associations.

When using an OSN, users explicitly declare their friends so that they are able to share information items with them (i.e. represented by an undirected graph similar to that of Fig. 1 .
 Our SpectralLink approach finds similarities between nodes in an undirected graph constructed from these connection data. Therefore, friends can be recommended to a target user u according to their weights in the similarity matrix.
In the following, to illustrate how our approach works, we apply the SpectralLink algorithm to our running example. As illustrated in Fig. 1 , 10 users are connected in a graph. If we have to recommend a new friend to U algorithm, we can get a similarity matrix between any two nodes of graph G and recommend friends according to their weights.
Firstly, SpectralLink computes the first k eigenvectors u equation LU X   X  U , where U matrix has columns, the eigenvectors u to the i -row of U . In our running example, we compute the first k = 2 eigenvectors and Tables 3 and 4 .

Secondly, we cluster nodes v i of U with the k -means algorithm into clusters C
Thus, we will partition data in 2 clusters. In Table 5 , we present vector IDX with i =1, assignment of a node v i in one of the two clusters. Thus, node U similarity between nodes that belong in different clusters.
 assigned in cluster C 1 ={ U 2 , U 3 , U 4 , U 8 , U 9 }, whereas the nodes that are assigned in cluster C partition of k -means is in accordance with the visual representation in the 2-dimensional space of the nodes in Fig. 2 a.
Thirdly, in contrast to a previous proposed work published in [15], in order to quantify the similarity between nodes, we are based on triangle inequality which states that for any triangle the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater space: | D ( i , IDX ( i ))  X  D ( j , IDX ( j ))|  X  dist ( i , j ) cluster, we have adapted the Bray  X  Curtis similarity measure [3], which also ranges in [0,1], using Eq. (1):
In our running example the similarity between nodes U 1 and U Eq. (2):
Thus, in our running example the similarity between nodes U contrast, Eq. (2) penalizes similarities between nodes that belong to different clusters. nodes. In our running example, as shown in Table 8 , node U recommendation is reasonable, because U 1 has 3 common interactors with node U can then be used to improve the friend/protein recommendation procedure, as will be verified by our experimental results. 4.2. The SpectralLink algorithm a node v i with each node v j in a graph G .

As shown in Fig. 3 , our SpectralLink algorithm is based on matrix L of a graph G . It takes the first k eigenvectors u
Then, based on these eigenvectors it clusters nodes v 1 ... interacting proteins. 4.3. Extending SpectralLink for signed networks
In this Section, we derive variants of SpectralLink that apply to directed networks and networks with weighted edges, including the case of edges with negative weights (signed networks).

Signed networks edges have positive (+1) as well as negative ( differentiation, development and apoptosis [40]. In such signed graphs, SpectralLink algorithm, can be adjusted accordingly. Firstly, we can use an alternative definition of diagonal degree matrix [14,21] by using the absolute diagonal degree matrix
D  X 
As the unsigned normalized Laplacian matrix, the signed normalized Laplacian matrix is positive semi-define. However, when each connected component of the graph contains a cycle with an odd number of negatively weighted edges, then the signed normalized Laplacian matrix can be positive-definite.
 4.4. Complexity analysis
Social and protein  X  protein interaction networks are large and contain a significant amount of information. Global based large graphs. In particular, RWR's main computational cost consists of a large matrix inversion, which has O ( n
Moreover, space complexity is another limitation of the RWR algorithms, since they require O ( n graph G is sparse, it holds that h bb n . Thus, the time complexity of FOAF is O ( n  X  h
Solving a standard eigenvalue problem for all eigenvectors takes O ( n becomes impractical for applications with n on the order of millions. However, real social and protein of a matrix  X  vector computation of L x , where L is the normalized Laplacian matrix and x is an eigenvector. The running time of the two-way Ncut algorithm is O ( m  X  n ), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of steps that are stored in each iteration.

Recently Yan et al. [47] proposed a k -means-based approximate spectral clustering algorithm (KASP), which applies firstly graph). By using this implementation, the overall computation cost of SpectraLink is O ( k 5. Experimental evaluation
In this section, we experimentally compare our new approach SpectralLink, with k -means [28] algorithm, the two-way normalized cut algorithm [29,38,39] , the Random Walk with Restart [33] algorithm, and the Friend of a Friend [6] algorithm, denoted as k -means, two-way Ncut, RWR, and FOAF, respectively. Our experiments were performed on a 3 GHz Pentium IV, with 2 GB of memory, running Windows XP. All algorithms were implemented in Matlab. 5.1. Algorithms settings
In this section, we present detailed information of the algorithms that will be compared experimentally with our proposed method: k -means algorithm: Given a set of nodes ( v 1 , v 2 , ... where v x is a node in cluster C i and c i is the centroid point for cluster C speci fi ed parameter, namely, the number of clusters desired. Each node is then assigned to the closest centroid, and each
After the cluster formation, for a node v i compute its similarity with each node v

Two-way Ncut clustering algorithm: Given a set of nodes ( v Ncut solves the generalized eigenvalue problem for the second smallest eigenvalue, as shown by Eq. (4) : where D is a diagonal matrix, A is the adjacency matrix,  X  eigenvector. Two-way Ncut uses the eigenvector with the second smallest eigenvalue to bipartition the graph, and decides if the current partition should be subdivided by checking the stability of the Ncut and making sure that Ncut is below the pre-number of groups, in which the clustered nodes are contained.

Random Walk with Restart Algorithm: The  X  random walk with restart before he makes a choice, with probability c , he goes back to node v defined as the steady-state probability r v x ; v y that the random walker will finally stay at node v where e  X  v x is the n  X  1 starting vector with the v x th adjacency matrix of graph G .

Eq. (5) defines a linear system problem where r  X  v x is a n wrt. node v x , as shown by Eq. (6):
In our experiments, we tuned the c parameter and the best results were produced when c is equal to 0.005.
Friend of a Friend algorithm: The Friend of a Friend (FOAF) algorithm [6] leverages only network information of Friending based on the intuition that  X  if many of my friends consider Alice a friend, perhaps Alice could be my friend too intuition behind it, is the primary algorithmic foundation of the the few known people recommenders deployed on a social networking site. Formally speaking, if we define predicate F ( v to be true if and only if node v i has a connection with node v recipient of a recommendation, its recommendation candidate set is defined as follows [6]:
For each candidate node v c RC v x  X  X  , its common interactor node set is CF ( v represents the interactors of v x that connect to v c and thus serve as a bridge between v each candidate v c for recipient v x as the size of CF ( v
The candidates are recommended to v x in decreasing order of their score. For a single recommended candidate v common interactors in CF ( v x , v c ) astheexplanationfor recommending v pathways of maximum length 2 between an individual and his possible interactors in a social or a protein network. Therefore, users/proteins can be recommended to v him in the network. 5.2. Real and synthetic evaluation data sets To evaluate the examined algorithms, we have used two synthetic data sets (50K,100K), three real social networks (Facebook,
Hi5 and Epinions) and three real human protein data sets (Human, Human Disease and Human Signaling). 5.2.1. Real OSNs datasets We crawled the graph data from the Facebook and Hi5 web sites at two different time periods. In particular, we crawled the Facebook web site on the 30th of October 2009 and on the 15th of December 2010. Our data crawling method was the following: web site we created a training data set with 3694 users (network size N = 3.694, number of edges E = 13,692), denoted as web site we created the probe data set with the same users by only preserving 3912 new emerged edges among them. We with 63,329 users and 88,261 edges among them, denoted as Hi5 63K, where the initial starting node of our crawling was a random user in the US. From the second crawl of Hi5 web site we created the probe data set with the same users by only preserving 16,512 new emerged edges connecting them. The graph data from the first crawl are used to predict the new links emerging in the second crawl. Moreover, we use in our comparison the Epinions 5.2.2. Real PPINs datasets
The first protein data set 5 used in this paper contains a total of 3269 unique interactions between 1925 different human proteins and is denoted as Human Data-set. The second protein data set 1200 interactions between 868 proteins and is denoted as Human Disease Data-set. Finally, the third network
Human Signaling Data-set contains 2938 interactions between 1221 proteins. 5.2.3. Synthetic datasets sizes. Although real networks have many complex structural properties [7], such as degree heterogeneity, the rich-club phenomenon, etc., as a start point for generating synthetic data sets, we consider a very simple model.
In contrast to purely random (i.e., Erdos-Renyi) graphs, where the connections among nodes are completely independent random characterizing each node with a ten-dimensional vector with each element a randomly selected real number in the interval [ nodes whose degrees are smaller than k , this selected node will connect to the most similar node with probability 1 randomly chosen one with probability p . This process will be terminated when all nodes are of degree k . The parameter p 100,000), by keeping an identical m nodes degree equal to 50 and for both data sets ( p is fixed to 0.2). 5.2.4. Topological properties of all datasets network is 5.34. This means that most proteins are very closely linked, a phenomenon that has been described as small world network. Small-world networks have sub-networks that are characterized by the presence of connections between almost any two since its average shortest path distance is equal to 7.97 though its logarithm of N is equal to 2.9. average shortest path length (ASD) equal to 4.23 and it can be also considered as a 5.3. Experimental protocol and evaluation metrics As already described in Section 5.2, in our evaluation we consider the division of Facebook 3.7K, Hi5 63K, Human and Human Disease data sets into two sets, according to the exact time stamp of the links downloaded: (i) the training set E known information and, (ii) the probe set E P is used for testing. No information in the probe set is allowed to be used for final performance of each algorithm.

Epinions, Synthetic, Human and Human Disease data sets do not have time stamps of the edges. The performance of the of the algorithms' needed parameters. We chose as values for the parameters those providing the best performance on the results, based on two-tailed t -test, are statistically significant at the 0.05 level.

 users/proteins in the future set of the target user/protein). 5.4. Sensitivity analysis for the SpectralLink algorithm number of clusters and (iii) with different controllable sparsity.

As discussed in Section 4.1, we have introduced two new similarity equations (Eqs. (1) and (2) ) to quantify the similarity between nodes that belong to same clusters and between nodes that belong to different clusters. Here, we perform experiments by considering also the following similarity measures [15]:
Eqs. (7) and (8) capture the proximity between two nodes by taking into consideration their distance from the cluster centroid. However, they do not consider the triangular inequality between the two nodes and the cluster centroid. and (2) ) and SpectralLink without triangular inequality (Eqs. (7) and (8) ). It is obvious that our new proposed equations outperform in all cases and this happens because we take full advantage of the upper and lower bound of the triangular inequality, as shown in Section 4.1. Thus, henceforth we will use Eqs. (1) and (2) for all experiments.
In Section 2 , one of the required input values for the SpectralLink algorithm is the number k of clusters. To improve our precision for varying k values in the synthetic 50K data set.
 ADEG, as already shown above.

Next, we measure the accuracy that SpectralLink attains, with different controllable sparsity. To examine the accuracy sparsity cases, by changing the m number of friends that a node has (50, 60, 70, 80, 90), as shown in Fig. 6 a. such cases the network density is increased. 5.5. Accuracy comparison of SpectralLink with other methods
We proceed with the comparison of SpectralLink with k -means, two-way Ncut, RWR, and FOAF algorithms, in terms of the Facebook 3.7K data set, in Fig. 7 a we plot a precision versus recall curve for all five algorithms. As shown, SpectralLink outperforms k -means, because it takes into consideration also the degree of connectivity of a graph. cutting the subsequent eigenvectors, which might be perfect partitioning vectors. RWR traverses globally the social/protein network, failing to capture adequately the local characteristics of the graph. FOAF cannot provide accurate recommendations because it exploits only length-2 paths, failing to capture the notion of the global characteristic of a graph. well-connected and results to lower recommendation accuracy.
 a graph.

As already mentioned in Section 5.2 the Human data set consists a small-world network, while the Human Disease data-set does not possess this property. This is why it results to low recommendation accuracy. 5.6. Time comparison of SpectralLink with other methods The results are presented in Table 10 .
 matrix, whereas SpectralLink performs calculations on the decomposed normalized Laplacian matrix. Moreover, SpectralLink bipartition.
 As expected, FOAF outperforms the other algorithms due to its simpler complexity. However, as already shown in Section 5.5, even if FOAF presents small time complexity. Finally, notice that these experimental results correspond to the algorithms' complexities, as previously discussed in Section 4.4. 5.7. SpectralLink accuracy in signed networks outperforms SpectralLink + . The reason is that SpectralLink information about negative edges, even to predict the presence or absence of positive edges. 6. Discussion studied a synthetic network model with controllable density.
 This paper concerns unweighted and undirected networks. However, our algorithm can be easily extended to more general cases. weighted matrix. 7. Conclusions
In this paper, we introduced a framework that uses an enhanced multi-way spectral clustering method, which is based on triangular inequality to measure node proximity in OSNs/PPINs. We compared our method with previous related work, k -means, two-way Ncut spectral clustering algorithm, and other well-known link prediction algorithms, using two synthetic, three real social networks and three real human protein data sets. We have shown that our SpectralLink algorithm provides more accurate networks. Bipartite social networks can also provide valuable information by also exploiting users' co-commenting on written posts, co-rating products and co-participating in groups. Bipartite protein on the information of proteins with genes interactions.
