 the AGM postulates, is a Gentzen-type deduction system to deduce a consistent one  X   X   X  from an inconsistent theory  X   X   X  of the first-order logic, where  X  be a maximal consistent subtheory of  X   X   X  which includes  X  as a subset, where  X  |  X  of atomic formulas or negations of atomic formulas. It was proved that if  X  |  X   X   X  |  X  is deducible and  X  |  X  0 is an R -termination, i.e., there is no R -rule to reduce  X  |  X  another R -configuration  X  |  X  00 , then  X   X   X  0 is a contraction of  X  by  X  .  X  |  X   X   X  ,  X  be provable in an R -calculus. Then,  X  is a minimal change of  X  by  X  ,
