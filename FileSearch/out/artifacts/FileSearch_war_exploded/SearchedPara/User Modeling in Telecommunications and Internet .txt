Successful user modeling should be aware of several critical issues: who are the target users? How should the solutions be updated when new data come in? How should user feedback be discuss my own experience on user modeling with big data. I will draw examples from telecommunications and the Internet industry, contrasting and highli ghting some lessons learned in these industries.
