 1. Introduction
Urban planning is a process that focuses on the control and on the design of urban environments in order to increase the well being of citizens. An important concern in urban planning is the characterization of urban land use, such as residential, industrial or parks. How each part of an urban landscape is used, is mainly determined by zoning regulations. In the context of urban planning, urban zoning is de fi ned as the designation of permitted uses of land based on mapped zones which separate one set of land uses from another (for example residential areas from industrial areas). One of the problems of zoning is to actually evaluate to which extent the areas are being used as required or planned, because the collection of data has to be done on site.
Such information is usually gathered through direct observation or using questionnaires that attempt to capture how citizens interact with their urban environment. This traditional approach has some limitations such as the resiliency of citizens to provide answers or the cost of running questionnaires, which highly limits the frequency with which the information is captured. Alternative approaches such as GIS (Geographic Information
Systems) ( Yin et al., 2011 ) provide satellite imagery that might reveal some types of land use information through image processing techniques. However, such techniques fail to provide real time information as images are not captured frequently and the land uses that can be identi fi ed do not cover the variety of land uses present in a city.
 leave behind footprints of their interaction with urban environ-ments. In this context, cell phones have become one of the main sensors of human behavior, thanks, among others, to their growing penetration and wealth of social applications. As a result, new research areas, such as urban computing and smart cities, focus on improving the quality of life in an urban environment by under-standing the city dynamics through the data provided by ubiqui-tous infrastructures and technologies. New data sources (including
GPS, Bluetooth, WiFi hotspots, geo-tagged resources, cell phone traces, etc.) are becoming more relevant for urban planning applications such as transport planning ( Frias-Martinez et al., 2012b ), traf fi c estimation ( Caceres et al., 2012 ) or social studies ( Oloritun et al., 2013 ).
 pervasive infrastructures for the automatic identi fi cation of land uses such as GPS ( Yuan et al., 2012 ), cell phone traces ( Soto and
Frias-Martinez, 2011 ) or social media applications such as Four-square ( Noulas et al., 2011 ). In general these approaches tend to focus on speci fi c land uses, on a speci fi c city, and they lack a quantitative validation of the results. Also, GPS and cell phone traces are dif fi cult to obtain due to privacy concerns, and in general, the location information available in social media applica-tions is limited, with the exception of Twitter.
 automatic identi fi cation of land uses. The proposed approach exclusively makes use of spatial (geo-tagged) and temporal (time-stamped) information of tweets, without accessing personal details or the content of the user-generated information. By doing so, it preserves privacy and can potentially be applied and/or complemented with any other mobile social media dataset with geolocation information. Our novel approach is designed to identify all possible land uses using spectral clustering, it is validated using real land use data provided by city planning departments and is tested in three different urban environments:
Manhattan (NYC), London (UK) and Madrid (Spain). 2. Related work
Our work arises as a combination of two research areas mainly crowd modeling and urban computing for urban planning. Differ-ent authors have used a variety of user-generated content services for implementing crowd behavior models. Wakamiya et al. (2011) and Fujisaka et al. (2010) studied how to exploit geolocated tweets and the semantics of its content to interpret individual and crowd behavior i.e., how individuals and groups of people move across geographical areas. They propose models of aggregation and dispersion as a proxy to understand the bursty nature of human mobility. Similarly, Kinsella et al. (2011) used geolocated tweets, together with their content, to create geographical models at varying levels of granularity (from zip codes to countries). The authors use these models to predict both the location of the tweet and the user based on location changes.

Recently, in the area of urban computing for urban planning we can fi nd a variety of results using geolocated information to model land use. The approaches can be divided according to its source of information: (1) location-based social networks (LBSN) traces from
Foursquare or Twitter; (2) call detail records (CDRs) from cell-phones; and (3) GPS traces. The three data sources represent a compromise between granularity and data generality: while GPS data has longitude  X  latitude information every couple of seconds for usually a very limited number of individuals (usually less than one hundred); CDRs have location information for millions of individuals at a tower level only when an interaction (call or SMS) takes place. LBSN offer an intermediate solution where location information is in the form of longitude  X  latitude for an intermedi-ate number of individuals (usually hundred of thousands).
Regarding LBSN, Noulas et al. (2011) have used the geolocated information provided by Foursquare to model crowd activity patterns in London and New York City using spectral clustering.
For that purpose, the authors characterize the activity patterns identi fi ed by the clusters using the prede fi ned Foursquare cate-gories that give an indication of the type of check-in location (restaurants, academic, etc.). As such, this approach gives an approximated understanding of land use. Frias-Martinez et al. (2012a) , Neuhaus (2011) presented preliminary results on using
Twitter for characterizing urban landscapes. Both studies showed that geolocated tweets potentially contain enough information to identify some land uses, although with some limitations. In the case of Frias-Martinez et al. (2012a) the main limitations arise due to the problems of using k -means as clustering technique to classify the terrain. In a related work Cranshaw et al. (2012) presents a new clustering model designed to study land use and social dynamics on a large scale using Foursquare. The results are validated with personal interviews that con fi rm the clusters identi fi
As for CDRs, Calabrese et al. (2011) used cell-phone records from Rome to study the relation between phone activity and commercial land uses using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the dominant pattern in each area. The results are qualitatively presented and validated and no land use information is actually used. A similar study was done by Ratti et al. (2006) in Milan. Soto and Frias-Martinez (2011) used the tower activity to characterize and cluster similar location patterns and imple-mented a qualitative evaluation of the results. Toole et al. (2012) also used activity patterns to cluster land uses using a random forest approach in Boston.

GPS data sources are not as commonly used for land use purposes due to the privacy concerns. In general the traces available come from public transport infrastructure such as buses and taxis, which limits its generalization. Yuan et al. (2012) present an initial study using GPS traces from taxis to derive individual mobility and identify regions of different functions using a prede fi ned map of the points of interest of Beijing, i.e., information of the city was used to derive land uses.

In general, the main limitations of the previous approaches are: (1) lack of a formal validation of the results using independent land use data; (2) the studies are presented just for one city, somehow limiting the potential generality of the proposed approach; (3) some data sources (mainly cell phone traces) have strong privacy limitations and (3) in some cases supervised approaches are used, which implies the need of having initial knowledge of the city to derive land uses. Our approach over-comes such limitations by using an unsupervised technique for land use classi fi cation that is based on an intermediate data source (both in the sense of number of individuals and privacy) such as Twitter. The approach is validated with external sources and its generality is tested using three cities as examples. 3. Sensing urban land uses using Twitter
The technique we propose for the automatic identi fi cation of urban land uses from geolocated tweets has two steps: (1) land segmentation and (2) land use detection. Note that the land uses (such as residential, industrial, parks, etc.) are not de hand but identi fi ed by the unsupervised learning technique. 3.1. Land segmentation with geolocated data
Given that we want to sense land uses in different urban regions, the fi rst step consists on partitioning the land into different segments, which can then be characterized by its usage pattern. The partitioning of the area considered has to preserve the topological properties of the geolocated tweets, while respecting the actual shape of the geographical area under study. We approached this problem using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) ( Kohonen, 1990 ).

SOM is a type of neural network trained using unsupervised learning that produces a two-dimensional representation of the training samples. It consists of nodes each one having a weight vector of the same dimension as the input data and a position in the two-dimensional space. Usually the initial weight of the vectors are random values and the initial arrangement of the nodes is a rectangular grid. The procedure for placing a vector from the input data onto the map is to fi nd the node with the smallest distance metric to the data space vector, which in turn updates the weight and the position of the neuron. In our case, the input data are the latitude &amp; longitude pairs that represent the geolocated tweets over a period of time for a speci fi c urban area. As a result, we use a SOM to build a map that segments the urban land into geographical areas with different concentrations of tweets.

Our SOM consists of a collection of N neurons organized in a rectangular grid [ p, q ], with N  X  p q . Since we can choose any initial size [ p, q ] for the map, our method explores different map sizes and selects as the best land segmentation map the topology that minimizes the Davies  X  Bouldin clustering index ( Davies and
Bouldin, 1979 ). The DB index is used to evaluate clustering algorithms, where the validation of how well the clustering has been done is made using quantities and features inherent to the dataset. It is formally de fi ned as:
DB  X  1 N  X  N
 X  where N is the number of clusters (neurons), w i and w j represent the position in the two dimensional space of the SOM neurons i and j , and  X  i and  X  j represent the standard deviation of the elements (geolocated tweets) included in each cluster. The DB index is chosen for land segmentation because the partition with minimum value will minimize the maximum sum of a pair of standard deviations  X  i and  X  j , i a j and will maximize the distance between cluster representatives (neurons), ensuring that even the most disperse clusters concentrate its points (geolocated tweets) inside a compact cluster.

As a result of the process, we obtain a map where each neuron represents a pointer to a region with a high density of tweets.
Additionally, areas with larger concentrations of tweets will have larger numbers of neurons geographically located nearby. Finally,
Voronoi tessellation ( Aurenhammer, 1991 ) is applied over the location of the neurons in order to compute the land segments that each neuron represents. These land segments are used as the elements for the characterization of land use. 3.2. Unsupervised learning for detecting urban land uses
We characterize each land segment by its average tweeting activity which will then be used to identify common land uses. For each land segment s , a Tweet-activity vector X s representing the average tweeting behavior is built as: 1. An activity vector x s,n for land segment s is built for each day n  X  1 , ... ,d in the dataset. 2. Each day n in the activity vector contains 72 components x ( t ) ,t  X  1, ... , 72 where each one represents the number of tweets generated in land segment s during a 20-min interval t in day n . 3. An average activity vector for each land segment s is computed for both weekdays X s,wkd and weekends X s,wkn , each one representing the average number of tweets (during the n days) in land segment s during the corresponding time period t, just considering weekdays (Monday through Friday) in the fi rst case and weekends (Saturday and Sunday) in the second:
 X  4. The fi nal activity vector is represented as the concatenation of weekday and weekend average activity vectors X s  X  { X s,wkd ,X s,wkn } and is normalized as:  X 
After this process, each land segment s is represented by a unique activity vector X s with 144 elements representing the average weekday and weekend tweeting activity computed in 20-min timeslots. These activity vectors are used to automatically identify and characterize urban land uses using clustering. We posit that land use can be derived from a careful analysis of the tweeting behaviors in each cluster, based on its activity vector as well as on its physical layout in the city.
 potentially applied to our land segmentation problem ( k -means, hierarchical methods, decision trees, Fuzzy Clustering, etc.) we have selected spectral clustering ( Shi and Malik, 2000;
Von Luxburg, 2007 ). Spectral clustering has become increasingly popular due to its advantages, including that no assumptions about the form of the clusters is made (as opposed to k -means for example); that is able to manage large dimensional datasets by using dimensionality reduction; that it is easy to implement using standard linear algebra; and that it obtains good clustering results with a low computational cost. Also it has already been used with success in related urban computing applications, such as in Noulas et al. (2011) to divide communities.
 construct, and a similarity matrix S that represents the pair wise similarities s i,j  X  s ( X i ,X j ) of all elements. In our context X represent the tweeting activity of each one of the land segments previously obtained. The similarity s i,j of two vectors X measured as the cosine similarity: opposite to 1 meaning exactly the same. The algorithm treats the data clustering problem as a graph partitioning problem, and as such, the fi rst step is to build a similarity graph G
Each vertex v i represents a data point x i and two vertices are connected by an edge e i,j if the similarity s i,j is positive; s
Two matrices are then created, a weighted adjacency matrix W (with the values of s i,j 4 0) and a degree matrix D .Inthis context, clustering can be reformulated as fi nding a partition of D such that the edges between different groups have very low weights and the edges within a group have high weights as de fi ned in W .
 sionality reduction and then applies a clustering algorithm, typi-cally k-means . It starts by using the degree matrix D and the weight matrix W to construct a Laplacian matrix L as ( Chung, 1997; Mohar, 1997 ): L  X  D W  X  5  X  k eigenvectors of L . Then, each one of the rows of U is clustered into k clusters using k -means ( Hartigan and Wong, 1979 ), which outputs the clusters identi fi ed with its corresponding elements.
 input, the eigengap detection technique is specially suited ( Luxburg, 2007 ). With this approach the number of clusters k is de fi ned by the rank of the eigenvalues where there is the largest difference in the value of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix arranged in increasing order.
 output k clusters each one containing the set of activity vectors of the land segments included in each clusters. In order to analyze the type of land associated to each cluster, we compute an average activity vector that represents the tweeting activity of each cluster.
Finally, we hypothesize the land use for each cluster based on its tweeting activity and its distribution across the urban environ-ment under study.
 4. Evaluation of land uses
We present an evaluation of our land use detection method for three metropolitan areas: Manhattan (NYC), London (UK) and
Madrid (Spain). We have selected these three cities because they show different densities of Twitter activity computed as the number of daily tweets per square kilometer in the urban perimeter considered: Manhattan has the highest Twitter density (84.13 tweets/km 2 ) followed by London with about half of that (42.51 tweets/km 2 ) and Madrid with a density of 10.88 tweets per square kilometer. As such, these three cities represent different cultural and behavioral Twitter attitudes useful to evaluate the limits of our approach. The objective of this evaluation is twofold: (1) to analyze to which extent the land use identi fi cation algo-rithm detects different types of land uses and (2) to understand the impact of the density of tweets on the accuracy of the method proposed. For that purpose we apply the algorithm on Twitter datasets of each one of the three cities considered and draw hypothesis regarding land uses based on both tweeting activity and location. To validate our results, we contrast our clusters and land uses hypotheses against real land use information collected by the corresponding city planning department. 4.1. Twitter datasets
Twitter users are allowed to tag tweets with their current geospatial location. Speci fi cally, users can set their geographical location by specifying a city or region or by allowing Twitter to track their GPS longitude and latitude coordinates. When a new tweet is produced, Twitter records the geographical information of the user at that moment, along with a variety of other metadata.
Given that we want to model land use within an urban environ-ment, we require highly granular geolocations. Thus, we only collect tweets whose location is automatically recorded by Twitter through the GPS and not self-reported by the user.

We used the Twitter Streaming API ( Twitter, 2013 ) to gather geolocalized tweets in near real-time. The streaming API enables a high-throughput stream to be established with Twitter by which a large volume of public statuses of tweets can be gathered.
Speci fi cally, the Twitter steaming API provides a sample of all tweet public statuses, currently about one percent of the full
Firehose set of tweets. Our fi nal Twitter dataset consists of 49 days (seven weeks) of geolocated tweets worldwide from October 25th to December 12th, 2010. The geographical area for London is de fi ned by the area de fi ned by what would have been Ringway 1.
As for Madrid, we roughly consider the urban area comprised within the M  X  30 highway. 4.2. Land segmentation and land use clustering
Our method trains a SOM with the set of geolocated tweets to divide the urban area under study into different land segments s characterized by their tweeting activity vector X s . Given the different geographies of the cities under study, we evaluated N in the range N  X  [10 , ... , 300] with N de fi ned as:
N  X  p U q with p ; q 4 1 and p ; q A  X   X  6  X 
The values of p and q de fi ne the number of neurons considered in each axis: p in the north  X  south axis and q in the east (we leave out the cases where N is a prime number). To adjust the neurons to the shape of each city, we only consider cases in which p 4 q for Manhattan and Madrid and p o q for London (Manhattan and Madrid have a longer north  X  south axis and London has a longer east  X  west axis). For example, in Manhattan N  X  10 would de fi ne an initial grid with p  X  5 and q  X  2 and N  X  12 would generate ( p  X  6 ,q  X  2) and ( p  X  4 ,q  X  3).
 Due to the randomized nature of the SOM training stage, 100 SOMs are trained for each city and each pair ( p, q ) with N [10, ... , 300] and their average DB index is computed. The mini-mum DB index was associated to N  X  64 for Manhattan with p and q  X  4; N  X  168 for London with p  X  12 and q  X  14; and N  X  91 for Madrid with p  X  7 and q  X  13.
 As an example, Fig. 1 shows the land segmentation for Manhattan. We observe that the Midtown area, where the best part of the tweets are geolocated (as shown in Fig. 1 (a)), shows a high density of neurons; whereas the north of Manhattan, with a scarce number of tweets, has a reduced number of neurons. Finally, the land segmentation is computed by applying Voronoi tessellation ( Aurenhammer, 1991 )toeachSOMcentroidinthe two-dimensional space as shown in Fig. 1 (c). Notice that areas with larger polygons represent areas with reduced Twitter activity.

Each one of the land segments identi fi ed in Manhattan, London and Madrid is characterized by its Twitter activity vector X has 144 components; the fi rst 72 describe the tweeting activity during an average weekday and the last 72 the activity during and average weekend day. Note that the number of X s vectors for each city is given by the optimal number of SOM neurons identi each case (64 for Manhattan, 168 for London and 91 for Madrid). Our method uses the set of X s vectors to identify different land uses for each city identifying clusters of similar normalized activity using spectral clustering; i.e., the similarity graph G is build in each case with the set of corresponding X s vectors. In order to identify the number of clusters k , we followed the eigenvector detection approach. As a result, the best number of land segment clusters is k  X  4 for Manhattan and Madrid, and k  X  5 for London. Table 1 summarizes for each city the parameters of each urban environment.

In order to understand the types of land uses identi fi ed by these clusters, we analyze the class representatives for each cluster together with its geographical distribution over the city map. A combined analysis can be used to provide a hypothesis about the potential types of land uses. Fig. 2 presents the class representa-tives for each one of the clusters identi fi ed across the three cities. Each representative (behavioral signature) is computed as the average number of hourly tweets and is normalized per cluster and per city. For analytical purposes, we group the signatures across cities by Euclidean similarity. We hypothesize that signa-tures that share similar shapes across cities represent comparable land use types.

We observe that the activity vectors in Cluster 1 are generally characterized by a larger tweeting activity during weekdays than weekends (see Fig. 2 (a)). During weekdays the highest tweeting activity is reached at around 9:30PM, 13:00PM and 8:30PM for Manhattan, which might be associated to the times at which people typically get to work, go for lunch, and leave work. The city of London shows similar peaks but slightly shifted in time. In the case of Madrid, the signature is shifted even more, suggesting that working hours might happen a little bit later during the day. The peak of the tweeting activity during the weekends is reduced by approximately 40% when compared to weekdays. In terms of geolocation of the clusters, these cover, among others, areas like Battery Park or Wall Street in Manhattan (see Fig. 3 ), the City and Canary Warf in London (see Fig. 5 ) and the surroundings of Castellana and the area of AZCA in Madrid (see Fig. 4 ), all areas heavily associated with business/of fi ce activities. For these rea-sons, we hypothesize that the geographical area covered by this cluster represents Business areas in Manhattan, London and
Cluster 2 shows a large difference between weekend and weekday activity, in fact, the signature is almost doubled in volume (see Fig. 2 (b)). During weekends, tweeting activity increases until the afternoon, and constantly decreases after that.
Geographically, these clusters cover regions like Central Park and nearby museums in Manhattan (see Fig. 3 ), Hyde Park or Regents Park in London (see Fig. 5 ) and El Retiro Park and Casa de Campo
Recreational Park in Madrid (see Fig. 4 ). Also included are heavily touristic areas, like Sol and the Flea Market of El Rastro in Madrid, or the London Eye , Buckingham Palace and Covent Garden in
London. Thus, we hypothesize that this cluster can be associated to Leisure or Weekend activities since users are active mostly during the weekends. However, we believe that it does not represent weekend nightlife since the tweeting activity highly decreases after 16:00PM during the weekends.

On the other hand, Cluster 3 is associated to very large activity peaks at night (see Fig. 2 (c)). These peaks happen at around 20:00  X  21:00PM during weekdays and between 00:00  X  06:00AM during the weekends. We observe that the peaks happen earlier in
London and Manhattan while a little bit later in Madrid suggesting that nightlife might continue until late hours in this city. Studying the physical layout of these clusters on the city maps, we observe that they cover areas like the East Village in Manhattan; the West End in London and Malasa X a / Chueca and Alonso Martinez in
Madrid (see Fig. 4 ), areas associated with restaurants, pubs and discos. All these elements suggest that this cluster might represent nightlife activities.
 ends and weekdays, where, during weekdays, there is a peak of activity in the afternoon between 6PM and 8PM depending on the urban area considered (6PM for Manhattan and London and 8PM for Madrid). Activity during weekends is of the same magnitude as in weekdays (see Fig. 2 (d)). This is the most important cluster considering the geographical area covered and the number of clusters included. The geographic layout of the clusters cover heavily residential areas in all cities: in
Manhattan the limits of the island and in Madrid and London the outskirts of the areas considered. In Figs. 3  X  5 ,theareas include with this cluster are the ones not marked with any color.
Our hypothesis for this type of signature is that it represents residential land use with citizens tweeting from home at any time during the weekends and after working hours during the week.
 signature is characterized by a reduced activity during the week-ends. The weekdays show a peak in activity very early, at around 10AM, after which a steady decrease happens showing little activity during the rest of the day. Looking at the physical layout, these clusters cover areas in the east and south of the city, like the area around Battersea Station and the Olympic Park . As a result of that, we hypothesize that this cluster represents Industrial land use (see Fig. 5 ).
 identifying the main land use of each cluster (although there might be other minor ones), since this is the way urban planners typically compute land use maps.
 4.3. Land use validation
In order to validate our land use hypotheses, we compare the evaluation results against of fi cial land use data released by the NYC Department of City Planning and the NYC Department of
Parks &amp; Recreation through the NYC Open Data Initiative ( NYC, 2013 ); against the ward pro fi les released by the London Datastore
Open Data Initiative ( London, 2013 ) and against the district land use information computed by the Urban Planning Department in Madrid's City Hall ( Madrid, 2013 ). These catalogs are produced by city agencies typically through a combination of on-site inspec-tions, interviews and questionnaires.

The NYC Department of City Planning considers four main land use types: (1) residential, (2) commercial, (3) industrial and (4) parks &amp; recreation (see Fig. 6 (a) for details). On the other hand, the information provided by the London Datastore considers three types of wards: (1) domestic buildings, which we associate to residential areas, (2) non-domestic buildings, which we pair up with business and industrial land use wards and (3) green spaces and paths. Finally, the information provided by the Urban City
Planning Department in Madrid provides land use information at a district level and considers four types: (1) residential areas with different density levels (which we group), (2) industrial, (3) ser-vices(commercial &amp; business) and (4) green spaces, as can be seen in Fig. 6 (b).
 To understand how well the clusters we have identi fi ed using
Twitter activity represent the of fi cial land use areas, we evaluate the percentage of overlapping that exists between the physical layout of the clusters and the of fi cial land use map for each city under study. Such analysis will give us an understanding of the accuracy of our approach to identify land uses as well as of the impact that the Twitter density might have on the quality of the results. It is important to highlight that the percentage of over-lapping is an approximate measure to validate land use identi tion given that both maps have different granularities: our cluster maps represent land segment clusters based on Voronoi and tweet density whereas the of fi cial land use maps show data at a block, ward or district level, depending on the city. Table 2 shows the percentages of overlap between the of fi cial land use maps for each city (rows) and our land use hypotheses (columns). Each element ( i, j ) in the tables represents the percentage of the of region that is covered by one of our land use clusters i.e., Business,
Residential, Nightlife, Leisure and Industrial. Note that in the case of Manhattan our Voronoi approximation to the island does not precisely cover all Manhattan land due to its irregularities, and as a result the percentage does not exactly sum up to 100%. Comparing our results across cities, we observe that Manhattan shows the highest percentages of of fi cial areas covered by our clusters, whereas London and Madrid share lower accuracies in terms of land use identi fi cation. It appears that the higher tweeting density that Manhattan has (84.13/km 2 ) has, as expected, a positive impact on the quality of land use identi fi cation.

The of fi cial commercial and business land uses in the three cities are identi fi ed quite well by our business cluster with area coverage between 61 and 81%. London is a special case in which the of non-residential land use is partially identi fi ed by our business cluster (61%) but also by our industrial cluster (25%). Similarly, the of fi cial Residential/Domestic buildings land use has a high overlap with our residential cluster with coverage between 56% and 68% of the of fi cial areas. However, we observe a generalized trend across the three cities whereby around a 20% of the of fi cial residential area is also covered by our nightlife clusters, probably highlighting residential areas with high densities of bars and restaurants. This is in fact common in areas like the East Village in New York, Chelsea in London or Chueca in Madrid.

While in London we are able to detect Industrial land use, and compare it to the of fi cial non-residential land use, the of Industry land use, present in Manhattan and in Madrid, goes undetected. We consider that the main reason for that is that in both cases, within the area of the city considered, industrial land is minimum (less than 3% of the total area in Madrid and less than 8% in Manhattan), and as a result they are included in larger Voronoi elements that has a different stronger land use. In fact, most of the of fi cial industrial land use is subsumed by our residential cluster in the case of Manhattan whereas in Madrid it is mostly covered by our business cluster. This might indicate that workers in the industrial areas are not using Twitter as much as people that live and/or work in that area, and as a result our technique captures the main land use, i.e., the of fi cial land use goes undetected due to lack of activity. Finally, the of fi cial Parks &amp; Recreation and Green-space &amp; Paths land use is identi fi ed by our leisure cluster with overlaps between 71% and 81% of the of fi cial land use maps.
On the other hand, our method identi fi ed a Nightlife cluster that has no counterpart in any of the of fi cial land uses. Nightlife clusters mostly overlap with the of fi cial Residential land use.
However, we wanted to understand whether the cluster is incor-rect or whether it is modeling a different type of land use not accounted for by the city halls. For the particular case of Manhat-tan, we identi fi ed the number of noise complaints per community district made to the 311 on-line service during 2010 (see Fig. 6 (c)).
Given that the community districts have much lower granularity than our land use clusters, we computed the percentage of the
Nightlife cluster that is included within the districts with the highest number of complaints, which corresponds to an 82% of overlap. Thus, it is fair to say that the Nightlife cluster detected by our method identi fi es a Nightlife land use that could be of interest for city halls to model potential areas of noise complaints. We did not fi nd such validation information for London and Madrid.
Our evaluation and validation for three different cities with varied physical layouts shows two important results. First, our methodology constitutes a good complement to model and under-stand in an affordable and near real-time manner land uses in urban environments. In fact, we have shown that residential, commercial and parks &amp; recreation areas are well identi coverage above 70%. Also, our approach is able to identify a land use, nightlife activity, not being considered up to now by city halls.
This has implications from a planning perspective as these areas usually cause noise and security problems and can move over time.

Second, Twitter density appears to have a reduced impact on the accuracy of our land use identi fi cation approach. As reported, coverage percentages of Manhattan, with a density of 84.13 tweets/km 2 are slightly higher than those for London and Madrid with densities of and 42.51 tweets/km 2 and 10.88 tweets/km , respectively. However, although the accuracy of the land use detection is slightly lower, the results still offer signi mation for land urban planners. The reason for the reduced impact is probably that as a result of normalizing the activity vectors
X  X  {X s,wkd ,X s,wkn } , clustering groups elements that have the same shape and not the same activity which limits the impact of the density of tweets on the results. 5. Conclusions
With the deployment of pervasive infrastructures and the increasing use of geolocated user-generated content, urban plan-ning will have a relevant and real-time source of information for characterizing urban dynamics. In this paper we have presented and validated an unsupervised approach for identifying land uses using location-based social media in Manhattan, London and
Madrid. The implementation has been done with Twitter, although the same technique can potentially be used with other social media, provided it has geolocated information. The results have shown that geolocated tweets can constitute a good complement for urban planners to model and understand traditional land uses (like industrial or residential) and identify new ones (like nigh activities) in an affordable and near real-time manner. We will continue to address this challenge and expand our methodology by combining geolocated information with the content of tweets. References
