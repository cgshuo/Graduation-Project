 Rafael C. Carrasco Abstract The IMPACT -es diachronic corpus of historical Spanish compiles over one hundred books X  X ontaining approximately 8 million words X  X n addition to a complementary lexicon which links more than 10,000 lemmas with attestations of the different variants found in the documents. This textual corpus and the accom-panying lexicon have been released under an open license (Creative Commons -NC -SA ) in order to permit their intensive exploitation in linguistic research. Approximately 7 % of the words in the corpus (a selection aimed at enhancing the coverage of the most frequent word forms) have been annotated with their lemma, part of speech, and modern equivalent. This paper describes the annotation criteria followed and the standards, based on the Text Encoding Initiative recommenda-tions, used to represent the texts in digital form.
 Keywords Diachronic corpus Historical Spanish Linguistic annotation TEI 1 Introduction Diachronic corpora are a valuable source of information with which to understand the historical evolution of languages. Unfortunately, diachronic collections are relatively scarce X  X t least, when compared to the overwhelming availability of resources containing transcriptions of modern text or speech (Kocjanc  X  ic  X  2009 ; Procha  X  zkova  X  2006 ; Davies 2010 ; Francis and Kucera 1979 ) X , since creating a diachronic corpus is a costly task. The transcription of old texts must be manually reviewed because a number of features X  X uch as spelling variations, old fonts, deprecated characters, and blurred text caused by stains or page transparency X  X ay cause the accuracy of the automatic process of converting printed text into computer-encoded text (commonly referred to as OCR or Optical Character Recognition) to fall below acceptable rates. In the particular case of Spanish, access to suitable linguistic resources can be challenging since the most renowned on-line diachronic resources, such as the Corpus Diacr X nico del Espa X ol  X  X ORDE (Real Academia Espan  X  ola s.a.) X , and the Corpus del Espa X ol (Davies 2002 ) can be consulted only via Web interfaces 1 which provide limited querying capabilities (Davies 2010b ).

This paper describes the IMPACT -es diachronic corpus of historical Spanish and the accompanying lexicon created by IMPACT , 2 a research project funded by the European Commission under its seventh Framework Programme and focused on the improvement of the precision of OCR and the access to historical texts. The components developed in IMPACT include:  X  Historical language resources for nine European languages which have allowed  X  A toolkit (Depuydt and de Does 2009 ) with which to build lexical resources,  X  Better OCR engines with improved technologies for image enhancement,  X  A large ground-truth data set (a collection of images mapped onto extremely  X  A framework of service and workflow layers (Neudecker et al. 2011 ) which
In particular, the IMPACT -es corpus contains 107 Spanish texts first printed between 1481 and 1748 and covering a representative variety of authors and genres editions or faithful reprints of the early editions. This content is divided into two separate sections: 1. The GT section which compiles the 21 Spanish documents in the ground-truth 2. The BVC section which compiles 86 texts provided by the Biblioteca Virtual
Moreover, the corpus is complemented with a lexicon that links more than 10,000 lemmas X  X orresponding to the most frequent word forms X , with a representative sample of attestations in the corpus. The full IMPACT -es corpus and the accompanying lexicon are available under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 license 4 and can be downloaded at the IMPACT Centre of Competence Website. 5 A compact version of the lexicon, with no quotes from the corpus, has also been released under a dual license X  X reative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 6 and GNU GPL v3 7  X  X n order to encourage its integration into free/open-source tools for the analysis and part-of-speech tagging of historical Spanish texts (Sa  X  nchez-Marco et al. 2011 ) such as FreeLing (Carreras et al. 2004 ).
 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diachronic corpus of historical Spanish distributed under an open license. In addition to the aforementioned CORDE and Corpus del Espa X ol , some other collections serve specific purposes. For example, the Corpus de Documentos Espa X oles Anteriores a 1700  X  X ODEA (Sa  X  nchez-Prieto Borja 2012 ) X  X ontains over 1,500 documents, written between the 12th and 17th centuries, mainly collected from archives (for example, letters and administrative, legal and ecclesiastic documents). The project Website 8 provides an interface through which to access the palaeographic and critical editions on a single-document basis. The Corpus Hist X rico del Espa X ol en M X xico  X  X HEM, (Medina Urrea and Me  X  ndez Cruz 2011 ) X  X ollects documents written between the 16th and the 20th centuries, but the access to the collection is restricted to text visualisation. 9
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The following section provides an overview of the source documents in the IMPACT -es corpus. Section 3 then describes the annotation process and the criteria followed in the annotation. The markup format used to encode the documents that integrate the corpus and the lexicon is presented in Sect. 4 Finally, some concluding remarks are presented in Sect. 5. 2 Corpus description The IMPACT -es corpus was created to assist in the improvement of OCR techniques by allowing the integration of specific vocabularies in the digitisation process in both information retrieval services and comprehensive evaluation frameworks. The selection of content and the annotation criteria have therefore been oriented towards this objective: for instance, the original spelling (even if clearly unintentional) has been preserved by the accurate transcription performed to create the ground-truth documents.

The GT section of the IMPACT -es corpus compiles 21 texts printed between 1543 and 1748, and contains around 6 million (unannotated) words with a transcription accuracy (as compared to the original text) of over 99.95 %. The author, title and dates of the first and source edition of the constituent documents are listed in Appendix 1 .
In order to ensure the 99.95 % fidelity to the source texts in the GT section we followed the standard acceptance sampling (Montgomery 2009 , part 6) statistical procedure for quality control: each document was processed in batches (containing between 500 and 1,200 pages) in which each page was scanned and the automatic transcription obtained from the scanned image was manually corrected; when the transcription of a whole batch was complete, a sample containing about 4 % of the pages was randomly selected and reviewed by an external quality control team; whenever the accuracy of the digitisation was found to be below 99.95 %, the whole batch was rejected and its processing restarted.

The BVC section of the corpus compiles 86 texts printed between 1482 and 1990 which are listed in Appendix 2 together with the dates of the first and source editions. These documents contain approximately 2 million words and a significant fraction of this content X  X ver 27 % of the section X , has been manually annotated with linguistic metadata. 10
The corpus is accompanied by a lexicon which links more than 10 thousand entries (simple or compound lemmas) with their attestations in the BVC section of the corpus. The historical variants are classified under lemma, part of speech and modern form (see Fig. 4 on page 9 for an example). Each occurrence of a variant is associated with the context in which it appears (10 preceding and 10 trailing words) and a reference to the document that contains it (title, author, dates of the first and source editions). The lexicon has been generated in parallel with the linguistic markup, and an ample coverage of lemmas and word forms was sought. Higher priority for their inclusion in the lexicon has therefore been given to the forms with a greater frequency. Since some words are very frequent, at most 500 occurrences per lemma have been annotated and therefore registered in the lexicon.

The metadata added to Spanish words are lemma (in modern form), part of speech and modern equivalent. The words originating from other languages (less than 0.1 %, and principally Latin) are labelled solely with their language. The part-of-speech categories and their tags X  X hown in Table 1 together with their relative frequencies X  X re based on those defined by the Apertium machine translation platform (Forcada et al. 2011 ) for the dictionaries in the Spanish X  X atalan language pair since, to the best of our knowledge, there is no Spanish diachronic lexicon available in digital form under a free/open-source license. Having a lexicon in digital form facilitated the manual annotation of the corpus as described below. 3 Annotation process and criteria The annotation was assisted by the CoBaLT tool (Kenter et al. 2012 ), a Web-based editor which supports the annotation of corpora and creation of corpus-based lexicons. In addition the tool allows a common annotation to be assigned to a sequence of consecutive words, and also accepts compound lemmas and compound part-of-speech categories.

For the annotation of the corpus we used the 22nd edition of the Diccionario de la Lengua Espa X ola (Real Academia Espan  X  ola 2001a ) as a primary reference in determining the lemmas. For archaisms, the on-line version of the Nuevo Tesoro Lexicogr X fico de la Lengua Espa X ola (Real Academia Espan  X  ola 2001b ), which compiles Spanish historical dictionaries dating from 1726 (up to the 21st edition of the Diccionario de la Lengua Espa X ola ), was employed as a secondary reference.
The annotation process was as follows. Initially, the texts (in plain text format), and a lexicon with pre-annotated word forms obtained from the Apertium dictionary aforementioned, were loaded into the CoBaLT tool. The texts were then tokenised and the word forms sorted by their frequency. Finally, the most frequent word forms were annotated. During the annotation, CoBaLT presented every word form and its attestations, and used the lexicon to suggest the lemma, modern equivalent and part-of-speech category. This lexicon was incrementally updated to simplify the annotation of word forms with multiple occurrences.

The following criteria have been applied during the annotation of the BVC section:  X  Modern forms with compound lemmas : word forms which cannot be associated  X  Word boundaries : whenever two or more consecutive words in the transcription  X  Archaisms : when the reference dictionary (Real Academia Espan  X  ola 2001a )  X  Numbers : all cardinal numbers share a single part-of-speech category (called  X  Optional diacritics : optional diacritics used only for disambiguation (for  X  Apocopation : the full form has been preferred as the lemma for words with  X  Past participles : past participles have been classified as verbs only if they follow  X  Proper nouns : all lemmas and modern forms, with the exception of proper
We have not split those word forms that are annotated with a compound lemma and a compound part of speech because they are written as single forms both in old and modern Spanish. A shared annotation has been assigned to those contiguous old word forms which in modern Spanish are written as a single word form. However, those contiguous old word forms that express numbers have been annotated independently of one another because they may either refer to a single number (e.g. diecis X is , Spanish word for sixteen) or to different numbers (e.g. diez y seis , Spanish words for six and ten). 4 Markup schema The IMPACT -es corpus is distributed as a collection of XML files, each of which corresponds to a different work, and organised in one folder per section. The XML standard (World Wide Web Consortium 2008 ) specifies how metadata must be elements that make up the logical structure of the document. The names of the elements and their attributes (optional features whose value can make the meaning markup vocabulary follows the Text Encoding Initiative P5 Guidelines. 11
The TEI vocabulary is widely and actively used in digitisation projects in the area of humanities, example of which are: Europeana Regia, 12 the Perseus Digital Library, 13 or the British National Corpus. 14 The TEI vocabulary defines a rich variety of elements such as paragraphs, words, and characters, in addition to a number of optional attributes X  X uch as type or language X  X or each element, and only a reduced subset has therefore been employed in this case. Other corpora released in the scope of the IMPACT project use a similar TEI vocabulary (Erjavec 2012 ).

Every document in the corpus is encoded in a single XML file whose root element (with tag TEI ) contains a header (under the element tag teiHeader ) X  X ith descriptive metadata of the document (marked as fileDesc ) X , and a body ( body ) X  with the digitised content structured in one or more divisions (elements div ) X . The descriptive metadata element includes the bibliographical description of the source (under tag bibl ) together with the information concerning the digital edition (under title element, an author element, the year of the first edition (as a date element with a first-edition value of the type attribute), and the year of the source edition (as a date second element with a source-edition value of the type attribute).
 Figure 2 illustrates the elements and attributes employed in the annotation of the BVC section within a single main division (element with a div tag) for each document:  X  Anonymous blocks (an element with an ab tag) contain one block of text (e.g., a  X  Every anonymous block contains one or more words (elements with a w tag).  X  Punctuation characters ( pc tag) and other characters ( c tag) can appear between
The subset of tags described above is similar to that used by Sa  X  nchez Marco et al. ( 2009 ).

The GT section documents contain one division per page (see Fig. 3 ) which accepts some sub-elements:  X  Page number, drop capital, footnote and table-of-content entries are tagged as  X  A heading is tagged as a head element.  X  Paragraphs are marked with a p tag.

Other constituents of the source document, such as figures, catchwords X  X ords placed at the foot of a page to anticipate the first word of the following page X  X r glosses were not digitised owing to the OCR orientation of the corpus.
 Because of its specific nature, a different subset of elements defined by the TEI P5 guidelines (module  X  X 9 dictionaries X  X ) has been employed for the lexicon (see Fig. 4 ). Indeed, the body of the lexicon document consists of entries (elements with an entry tag) which contain:  X  A lemma as an element with a form name (a form is defined by TEI as an  X  A number of modern variants of the lemma, labelled as elements with a form
On the one hand, every form element of a lemma type contains:  X  The lemma under the orth TEI element (which is defined as the orthographic  X  The part-of-speech category (under the gram element that provides grammatical  X  The number of annotated occurrences in the collection, given by the content of a
On the other hand, every form element of a modern-form type contains:  X  The orthographic variant, as the content of an orth element.  X  One or more form elements with historical-form type which contains the
Finally, every attestation contains the following information:  X  The bibliographical information (within the bibl element), i.e. the reference of  X  A number of quotes within the quote element in which the historical form is 5 Concluding remarks The IMPACT -es open diachronic corpus of historical Spanish contains approximately 8 million words and has been released under an open license (Creative Commons BY-NC-SA). We have described the criteria applied for the linguistic annotation X  of nearly 7 % of the words in the corpus X  X ith lemmas, parts of speech and modern equivalents.
 The corpus is divided into two sections: the BVC section (from the Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes digital library), which has been manually annotated, and the GT section (developed by the IMPACT project), which has been digitised with a fidelity of 99.95 % to the original. Furthermore, a lexicon has been extracted from the BVC section. Every entry in the lexicon corresponds to one lemma and part of speech, and contains a sample of variants and their attestations in the corpus.
