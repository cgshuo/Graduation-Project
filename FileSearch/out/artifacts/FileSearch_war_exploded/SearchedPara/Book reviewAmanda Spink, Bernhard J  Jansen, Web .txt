This book should be seen as an essential reference work for library schools, and for information seeking courses and researchers. In the digital era, information scientists and those teaching online search skills need to know how real users find information online. But knowledge of the search process is not just of value from an information science perspective: search engines have enormous financial power ( Van Cou-vering, 2004 ), and businesses that attract Web searchers can reap huge financial rewards. Hence, search en-gine optimisers, a new breed of marketing or information professional, will benefit from knowing how search engines are used, as will conscientious Web masters who wish to attract visitors to their site. For broader sociological inquiry, as well as for information seeking and behaviour research ( Case, 2002 ), it can also be useful to know about how people search online. One important way of addressing these issues is to find out how Web surfers in general use commercial search engines. Which keywords are commonly used, and how many? Are advanced search features often used, and are they normally used correctly? How long do typical search sessions last, and how many result pages tend to be viewed? To answer these ques-tions, the best sources of information are the log files of commercial search engines. The authors of this book are two of an exclusive band of researchers that have been given access to such data, and this book usefully summarises the results of much of their research.
 The book offers three types of information in three separate sections. The first section, on the context of Web search, starts with an overview of search engine technology and the demographics of Web use. This is written in plain English, aimed at a non-technical user. The second chapter of the context section gives what is effectively the theoretical background to the main data analysis part of the book. It reviews a wide range of information behaviour and human computer interaction studies related to Web searching. These studies use different (and complimentary) approaches to that of the book, for example user studies for a particular type of searcher. Next, there is a methods chapter describing in reasonable detail the techniques used in the main part of the book. This is a self-critical chapter, highlighting methodological strengths and weaknesses.
The second book section reports the main findings, focussing on what a general user searches for and how they search the Web. The  X  X  X hat X  X  is answered by tables of the most frequent terms, co-occurrences of fre-quent terms in searches, and topic trends (1997 X 2001). The  X  X  X ow X  X  is addressed through analyses of query length, query type (advanced/Boolean or normal), documents viewed per query, and language. Natural lan-guage queries are also considered. The  X  X  X ow X  X  is also addressed through session-based analyses: i.e. multiple searches by the same user over a short period of time. Statistics reported include searches per session, results viewed per session, session lengths and multi-topic session frequency. These all help to paint a picture of typical Web search events.

The third section covers three broad search topics and one search type. The three topics are e-commerce, health and sex. Searches for each of these topics are analysed using the same methods as the previous section, but applying them to reduced data sets judged to be topic-relevant. The same approach is taken for the final chapter in this section, multimedia searching. The four chapters serve to partly offset a generic limitation of search engine log file analysis: that the aggregation of the data over a large number of users and information seeking needs inevitably results in very generalised research conclusions. This book is packed with facts and trends, so many that it is difficult to give an overall impression of the findings.
But one nugget illustrates its potential value:  X  X  X ompany or product name queries were the most common form of business query  X  X  (p. 134). This tells business Web developers that they should strive to get their site highly ranked in search engines for relevant company and product names, information that must be of significant commercial value.
 ern reader will probably be disappointed that Google is not amongst the set of search engines analysed X 
AltaVista, Excite, Ask Jeeves and AllTheWeb X  X hich is due to Google  X  s privacy policy. Moreover, the data analysed represents snapshots of Web searches over short periods of time: another unavoidable limitation. I felt that it could have included a more solid theoretical background, for example in chapter 3 (building upon the review of other studies). But these are minor points, which should not detract from the enormous value of this book. In fact, since the recent search engine mergers ( Van Couvering, 2004 ) seem likely to limit the chances for future researchers to gain access to the log files of major search engines, this may be the first and last book of its kind. This would be a real problem in information science, given the importance of Google to increasingly many types of information seeking.
