 collection of related, structured tasks that produce a speci lot of work is done in this area, we still have not developed a common agreement relative to central notions such as:  X  Quality of business process models so they can be used to achieve their purpose.  X  Appropriate modelling formalisms and extensions of modelling formalisms and approaches to support achieving and maintaining model quality.  X  Needs for tools and methods to support process modelling.
 Within process modeling we have found the move towards standardization, e.g. to the use of BPMN, but it can be argued that BPMN do not address all the goals of many years worked with SEQUAL, a framework for understanding the quality of models and modeling languages, which we have seen can subsume all main aspects [3, 4, 6, 11] with the original framework.
