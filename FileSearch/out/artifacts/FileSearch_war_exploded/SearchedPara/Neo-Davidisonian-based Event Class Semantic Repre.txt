 The event class is objective and its action, object, time and environment are also ob-jective, which do not depend on the language that describe them [1] . From the aspect of the event semantic, the meaning of the sentences in natural language can be repre-sented by the specific event semantic structure. Additionally, each event semantic structure is not completely independent and there are event semantic relationships between them. The same as eve nt classes and their relationships. Thus, it can find the essential features of semantic model in natural language by representing event classes and their relationships, which can get a new event semantic -based language cognition from the aspect of comput ational linguistics.
 There are inherent relationships between events in the real world. An event class is a set of events with common features. Thus, there are inherent relationships between event classes. Event ontology is an event class -based formal knowledge base, which is consist ent with human cognitive law . Event classes and their relations are important parts of event ontology [1] . Representing event classes and their relationships b y for-mal language benefits to event ontology. It not only indicate s the criticalness and them what they read. In this paper, Firstly, we introduced some related work abou t event representation and reasoning (section 2), Secondly, gave event class model and their relationships (sec-tion 3), and then we gave a novel framework of event class representation by marriage event class model and Neo -Davidsonian event semantic and a new framework of event class relationship representation.(section 4). Finally, we treated event classes and their relationships as knowledge base , proposed rule -based event reasoning and event class reasoning methods and gave some reasoning examples. ( sect ion 5) At present, many researchers are concerned about the event semantic representation , rather than the event class representation. Ontology language -based and Neo -Davidsonian event semantic are the main methods of event semantic representa tion .  X  Ontology Language Ontology language mainly includes RDF (S) [2] , OWL [3] and DL [4] , etc., which are usually used to represent the concept, and the classification relationship between con-cept s . However, event is dynamic, which is different from the static concept. Some researchers extended ontology language and proposed new ontology language to rep-resent event semantic. Chang Liang [5] proposed a unified formal framework called dynamic description logic, which can represent both of static and dynamic knowledge. Wei Liu considered the dynamic feature o f event and extend ed O WL and DL to represent event for event ontology and did simple event -based knowledge rea-soning [6, 7] . Based on c onceptual depe ndence theory, Schank [8] used script to repre-sent some event sequences and action se quences in specific field. Batsakis [9] propos ed a ontology language to represent the temporal and spatial information in terms of qu antity and quality, and provided a powerful set of o perations including the reason-ing from existing temporal and spatial relationships to unknown relationships.  X  Neo -Davidsonian Event Semantic The Neo -Davidsonian event semantics are derived from the marriage of formal se-mantics and event semantics. Classical work in formal semantics, such as Montague [10] , represents the meaning of a verb with n syntactic arguments as an n -ary relation. Davidson [11] argued that verbs denote relations between events and their arguments; syntactic arguments are also arguments of the semantic predicate. Neo -Davidsonian position [10, 12 -14] relates the relationship between events and their arguments by thematic roles; syntactic arguments as well as modifiers are combined with the event via thematic roles. Kratzer, A. [15] thought verb described the relation between event and its thematic roles. Champollion [16] made event semantics go well together with quantification by presenting a simple, variable -free framework which combines a Neo -Davidsonia n event semantics with a type -shifting based account of quantifier scope. And he [17] argued that distance -distributive items across languages are in essence overt versions of these operators, described and explained observable cross -linguistic differences in overt dis tributive items in the framework of Neo -Davidsonian algebraic event semantics. Ontology language, especially DL and OWL, are the concept -based knowledge representation approach, which focus on the defini-tion of concept and classification relation between co ncepts. The ontology language is good for representing the static domain knowledge through the conceptual taxonomy, and it is an effective way to represent the specific model. The Neo -Davidsonian event semantics represent the event semantic of natural lang uage from the perspective of linguistics. It treated event predicate as univariate predicate with only event argument has more detailed event semantic than Davidsonian ev ent semantic. However, the Neo -Davidsonian event semantic mainly focus on specific examples of English cor-pus and discussed specific modifiers of them. It didn X  X  discuss some other modifiers of events such as fuzzy information, complex object, complex envi ronment and some concepts describing object of event etc. There are many different event relations, which include causality, following, concurrency etc. The ontology language only described the classification relation, and the Neo -Davidsonian event semanti c didn X  X  represent them. Definition 1 event [1] : We define event as a thing occurring in a certain time and envi-ronment, which some actors take part in and show some action features. Event e can be defined with a 6 -tuple formally as formula (1)
We call elements in 6 -tuple as event elements. Where A denotes an action or a set pants and entities involved in the event. We name participant as actor and define two types of actors, action initiators and action recipients. T denotes time in the event. V denotes the location of an e vent; P denotes assertion, which describes object statuses during an event occurring, including pre -condition set, mid -condition set and post -condition set. Pre -condition describes a set of object statuses that should meet to trig-ger the event occurring. M id -condition describes a set of object statuses when the event happening. Post -condition is a result set of object statuses after event occurring; L denotes language expressions of text -based event, it includes a Core Words Expres-sions (CWE) set and a Core Words Collocations (CWC) set [1] .

Definition 2 Event class is an abstract event that represents a set of events with some common features, denoted as EC in the formula (2): C = {  X   X  1 ,  X   X  2 ,  X  ,  X   X  X  X  ,  X  } ( i  X  { A , O , T , V , P , L } , m  X  0 ) ( 2 ) Where E denotes an event set. C  X  is the set of event elements. It denotes the common features set of certain event element (element i).  X   X  X  X  denotes one of the common fea-tures of event emement i.  X   X  X  X  is also called event elements class. Liu zongtian [1] proposed an event -based ontology model, summarized a set of events wit h common features into an event class. He divided relationships between the event classes into two categories: taxonomic elation and non -taxonomic relations. He thought the taxonomic relation describes the hierarchical structure of event classes, Non -taxon omic relations describe the internal semantic relationships between events or event classes, including composition relation, follow relation, causality relation, concurrency relation and idea content relation. We represent respectively the above non -taxono mic relations with the following symbols:  X  ,  X  ,  X  ,  X  and  X  . An event class is a set of events with common features. Thus, an event class has also action, object, time, environment, assertion and language expression. We did marriage 6 -tuple event class model and Neo -Davidsonian event semantic and gave a new framewor k of event class semantic to represent event class. The framework treated event class predicate as univariate predicate including only event class argument and connected event class predicate with event class arguments by thematic roles via  X  symbol. Where the  X  symbol denotes only a connection symbol between event class predicate and event class arguments. Compared with the elements of event, the ele-ments of event class are abstracted from the corresponding elements of event, which are not the concrete con cept instances. We represented these abstracted concepts of event class in detail using Description Logic.
 The new framework of event class representation is shown in formula (3)  X  X  X   X  ( ec ,  X   X  )  X   X  X  X   X  ( ec ,  X   X  ) ) ( 3 ) Where ec denotes the argument of event class,  X  ec denotes an existing event class.  X  X  X  ment role of event class and  X   X  denotes the content of environment role.  X  X  X   X  ( ec ,  X   X  ) denotes assertion role of event class and  X   X  denotes the content of assertion role.  X  X  X   X  ( ec ,  X   X  ) denotes the language expression role of event class an d  X   X  denotes the content of language expression role.
 Event classes are derived from people's long -term accumulative cognition about the occurring probability. Thus, we introduced an occurring probability into the frame-work of event class representation. The event class semantic can be represented in the formula (4) the occ urring probability between ec i and ec j is p. Where T can be  X   X   X   X   X   X   X  and  X  .
 We took event classes  X  X njure X  and  X  X ure X  for example to represent event class and their relation.
 Example 1: The  X  X njure X  event class can be described with 6 -tuple event class model in table 1 The  X  X njure X  event class can be represented with the given framework of event class representation as (1a)  X  t )  X   X  X  X   X  ( ec , event sence )  X   X  X  X   X  ( ec ,  X  X  X   X  . Theme is ok ,  X  X  X   X  . Theme is wounded ) The  X  X ure X  event class can be described with 6 -tuple event class model in table 2  X  C ure  X  event class can be represented with the given framework of event class repre-sentation as (2a) ( 2a )  X  ec [ cure ( ec )  X   X  X  X   X  ( ec , cure , rescue , injection )  X   X  X  X   X  . Agent ( ec , doctor , nurse , etc )  X   X  X  X   X  . Theme ( ec , the wounded person , patient )  X   X  X  X   X  ( ec , t +  X  t )  X   X  X  X   X  ( ec , event sence or hospital )  X   X  X  X   X  ( ec ,  X  X  X   X  . Theme is injured or sick ,  X  X  X   X  . Theme is cured by  X  X  X   X  . Agent ,  X  X  X   X  . Theme is ok . )  X   X  X  X   X  ( ec ,  X  X  X   X  . Agent cure  X  X  X   X  . The me ,  X  X  X   X  . Theme is cured by  X  X  X   X  . Agent , etc ) ] W here doctor, nurse, the wounded and patient are concepts and can be represented with DL as follows: doctor = human  X   X  treating . person nurse = human  X   X  nursing . person the wounded person = human  X   X  injured . person patient = human  X   X  ill . person There is a causality relation between  X  X njure X  and  X  X ure X , and the occurring probabil-ity is 0.9. The causality relation between them can be represented as (1b). (1b) R (Injure  X  Cure , 0 . 9 ) Human usually use brief words to describe an event, which cause some thematic roles about the event. There is a consistent knowledge base in human brain. When people hear or see an event occur, the brain will appear the whole picture of event. Similar to human, computers can also know events . One of the main purposes of the event rep-resentation is to serve the event semantic knowledge reasoning. Event class -based knowledge reasoning is multi -lev el, mainly including event arguments entailment reasoning and event class relation reasoning. 5.1 Event entailment reasoning rule As far as an event concerned, the corresponding event class and the related another event class contain many entailment semantic i nformation of the event.
 Definition 3 event instance: event e is an event instance of event class EC, whose necessary and sufficient condition is that the set of event action is the subset of event class trigger words, and the object, time and environment is consistent with the corre-sponding restrictions of event class EC, which are represented in formula (5), event instance can be denoted as e:EC. ( {  X   X  }  X  {  X  X  X   X  X  X  |  X  X  X   X  X  X  ,  X   X  1 } )  X   X   X   X   X  X  X   X   X   X   X   X   X  X  X   X   X   X   X   X   X  X  X   X  ( 5 ) EC respectively. D efinit i on 4 element instance: if event e is an event instance of event class EC, then, the element ef of e is the corresponding element instance of EC, which is denoted as S ome event entailment reasoning rules are shown in table 3
N um ber R ule 5.2 Event element entailment reasoning W e didn X  X  consider fuzzy information reasoning. We treated event classes and their relations as knowledge base, got the entailment event arguments by rule -based rea-soning methods. The reasoning steps are show n in the following:  X  S tep 1  X  Represent event  X  S tep2  X  Treat event class that is the root node as as the starting point for the search  X  Step 3  X  If the rule 1 in table 3 is met, then to Step 4, else to Step 5.  X  Step4  X  According to the rules in table 3 , got the entailment elem e nts of the event algorithm, Else, treat  X  X  X   X  as the  X   X  . as the  X   X  . as the  X   X  . treat  X  X  X   X  as  X   X  directly. And to Step 6.  X  Step 5  X  Match the next event class , if success to Step 4, else to Step 5 until the end. two event cla sses, then compare the occurring probability with the value of thresh-event occurring and represent it, then to Step 4, else end the reasoning.
 Where we only consider th e causality relation between event classes.
 Example 2:  X  1  X  The driver is injured. (1a)  X  e [ injuring ( e )  X   X   X  ( e , injuring )  X   X   X  . Theme ( e , The driver ) ] I n example 2, the event can be represented as (1a). The action of the event Thus,  X   X   X   X  X  X   X  . Each event is in the specific time and environment. Thus,  X   X   X   X  X  X   X  ,  X   X   X   X  X  X   X  . T herefore, we can infer that the event is the event instance of  X  X njure X  event class with rule 1 in table 3.
 The event has object element in language expression. We can infer that the driver is the concept instance of animal with DL and rule 2 in table 3.
 The event has no time element in language expression. We treat the time of  X  X njure  X  X vent class as the time of the event. Thus, we can infer that the time of event is in t +  X  t with the rule 3 in table 3.
 T he event has no environment in language expression. We treat t he environment of ronment of the event is in the site of event occurred with rule 4 in table 3. replaced  X  X  X   X  as the  X   X  of the event. Thus , we can infer that the assertions of the event as follows: Pre -condition: the driver is ok.
 Mid -condition: the driver is injuring.
 Post -condition: the dri ver is injured.
 replaced  X  X  X   X  as the  X   X  of the event. Thus, we got the language expression of the event as follows: the driver is injured, injured etc.
 There is a c ausality relation between injure event class and cure event class, and the occurring probability is 0.9 represented as (1b) in example 1, which is greater than the given value of threshold 0.7. In other words, if someone is injured, it is usually cured. Th erefore, we considered that the driver is cured. Thus, the cure event occurred as (2).  X  2  X  The driver is cured. (2a)  X  e [ curing ( e )  X   X   X  ( e , curing )  X   X   X  . Theme ( e , The driver ) ] instance of  X  X ure X  event class with rule 1 in table 3.
 The event has object element in language expression. We can infer that the driver is the concept instance of the injured wi th DL and rule 2 in table 3.
 The event has no time element in language expression. We treat the time of cure event with the rule 3 in table 3.
 T he event has no environment in language expression. We treat the environment of cure event class as the environment of event. Thus, we can infer that the environment of event is in the site of event occurred or in hospital with rule 4 in table 3. W e replaced the object in  X  X  X   X  of cure event class with the driver, and treated the re-lows: pre -conditions: the driver is injured . mid -condition: doctor and nurse are curing for the driver. post -co nditions: the driver is ok. W e replaced the object in  X  X  X   X  of cure event class with the driver, and treated the re-placed  X  X  X   X  as the  X   X  of event. Thus, we got the language expression of cure event as follows: doctor cured the driver, the driver is c ured by doctor, cure etc. 5.3 E vent class relationship reasoning We treated event class relationships as knowledge base to achieve rule -based event class relationship entailment reasoning. Some reasoning rules are shown in table 4. Example 3: (3a) Causal ( Earthquake  X  Injure , 0 . 7 )  X  R ( Injure  X  Cure , 0 . 9 )  X  ( 3a ) can be interpreted as follows: there is a causality relationship between earthquake event class and injure event class, and the occurring probability is 0.7, and there is a causality relationship between injure event class and cure event class, and the oc cur-ring probability is 0.9, then, we can infer that there is a causality relationship between earthquake event class and cure event class, and the occurring probability is 0.63 with the rule 1 in table 4.
 Example 4: (4a) R ( Earthquake  X  Injure , 0 . 7 )  X  R ( Injure  X  Rescue , 0 . 8 )  X  ( 4a ) can be interpreted as follows: there is a causality relationship between earthquake event class and injure event class, and the occurring probability is 0.7, and there is a follow relationship between injure event class and rescue event class, and the occ ur-earthquake event class and rescue event class, and the occurring probability is 0.56 with the rule 2 in table 4. event class is a set of events with common features, and there is also an inherent rela-tionship between the event classes. We did marriage Neo -Davidsonian event semantic and 6 -tuple event class model and gave a novel framework of event class representa-tion and a new framework of event class relationship representation. Additionally, we took injure and cure event classes for example to represent event classes and their relationships using the frameworks . Then, we treated event classes and their relation-ships as knowledge base and gave the reasoning steps for event arguments entailment reasoning with some reasoning rules. Finally, we achieved rule -based event class relationship reasoning. The given exampl es indicate that the frameworks we gave can represent event classes and their relationships and have abilities to achieve rule -based event entailment reasoning and event class relationship reasoning. Event classes and ontology and carry out event ontology -based knowledge reasoning.
