 Abstract The paper presents the Chinese Discourse TreeBank, a corpus annotated with Penn Discourse TreeBank style discourse relations that take the form of a predicate taking two arguments. We first characterize the syntactic and statistical distributions of Chinese discourse connectives as well as the role of Chinese punctuation marks in discourse annotation, and then describe how we design our annotation strategy procedure based on this characterization. The Chinese-specific features of our annotation strategy include annotating explicit and implicit discourse relations in one single pass, defining the argument labels on semantic, rather than syntactic, grounds, as well as annotating the semantic type of implicit discourse relations directly. We also introduce a flat, 11-valued semantic type classification scheme for discourse relations. We finally demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with evaluation results.
 Keywords Discourse TreeBank Discourse relations Chinese Explicit and implicit discourse connectives 1 Introduction In a time when statistical, data-driven approaches dominate the field of computa-tional linguistics and natural language processing, a consistently annotated linguistic corpus is a crucial enabling resource that helps advance the state of the art of a particular area. For example, the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al. 1993 ) revolutionized syntactic parsing and pushed syntactic parsing performance to unprecedented levels (Collins 1999 ; Charniak 2000 ; Petrov and Klein 2007 ). The PropBank (Palmer et al. 2005 ) and FrameNet (Baker et al. 1998 ) generated a tremendous amount of research in semantic role labeling (Pradhan et al. 2004 ; Xue and Palmer 2004 ; Punyakanok et al. 2004 ; Toutanova et al. 2005 ). The TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al. 2003 ) enabled substantial amount of research in temporal processing (Mani et al. 2006 ). The successes of this general approach of  X  X  X nnotate and learn X  X  inspired the creation of similar resources in other languages (Xue et al. 2005 ; Xue and Palmer 2009 ). In this article, we describe our effort to create a Chinese Discourse TreeBank and we hope this corpus will spur the development of Chinese discourse analyzers, among its other possible uses.

The creation of a corpus annotated with discourse structures starts with identifying a well-grounded linguistic theory that can be easily operationalized and can scale up to domain-independent texts. There are many alternative conceptions of the discourse structure of natural language text (Hobbs 1985 ; Mann and Thompson 1988 ; Asher 1993 ), and some of them have been tested against empirical data and have been used to guide discourse annotation efforts (Carlson et al. 2003 ; Wolf and Gibson 2005 ). We adopted the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) (Miltsakaki et al. 2004 ; Prasad et al. 2008 ) discourse annotation framework. The PDTB annotation framework has grown out of the DLTAG (Webber and Joshi 1998 ; Webber et al. 1999 , 2003 ), a lexicalized conception of the discourse structure of a text. As is often the case, when a theoretical framework is used to guide an annotation project, the theoretical framework may need to be modified based on empirical evidence encountered in the annotation process. This is the case here. While the PDTB project preserves the fundamental assumptions of the DLTAG, it does not subscribe to all aspects of the DLTAG theoretical framework and strives to maintain a  X  X  X heory-neutral X  X  stance regarding the high-level representation of the global discourse structure of a text.

In the PDTB conception, discourse relations revolve around discourse connectives, explicit or implicit. Each discourse connective functions as a predicate and takes two arguments. The discourse connective, together with its two arguments, instantiates a discourse relation, and in this sense discourse relations are lexicalized. Lexicalization makes highly abstract discourse relations grounded to a lexical item, the discourse connective, and in doing so, it also localizes the ambiguity in discourse annotation to discourse connectives, where a lexical item can have a discourse connective use or a non-discourse connective use (e.g.,  X  X  X hen X  X ), and one discourse connective can be ambiguous between different discourse relations (e.g.,  X  X  X ince X  X ). Part of the annotation effort is devoted to resolving such ambiguity. When an explicit discourse connective is not present, the PDTB assumes that there is an implicit discourse connective that relates its two arguments, which are typically (parts of) adjacent sentences. This is operationalized by identifying punctuation marks (e.g., periods) that serve as boundaries of two adjacent sentences as anchors of implicit discourse relations. The semantic classification of the discourse relation is determined by testing which discourse connective can be plausibly inserted between these two adjacent sentences. In doing so, the PDTB assumes that (1) the range of possible discourse relations anchored by implicit discourse connectives are basically the same as those anchored by explicit discourse connectives, and (2) discourse relations anchored by implicit discourse connectives are mostly local.

By insisting that discourse relations be lexicalized, the PDTB framework reduces the cognitive load of the discourse annotation task because each annotator can focus on only one discourse connective at a time instead of having scores of discourse relations to choose from. Similarly, by focusing on local implicit discourse relations that occur between adjacent sentences, the PDTB conception of the discourse structure does not commit to a global structure for the entire text and attempt to annotate the dependencies between separate discourse relations. This means that the annotator does not have to hold the global discourse structure of the text in memory when annotating a new chunk of text. We believe that these are very attractive properties, especially for large-scale annotation projects where many annotators are involved and inter-annotator consistency is crucial to the utility of the annotation.

Although the successful annotation of the Penn Discourse TreeBank proved the feasibility of this annotation framework for English, when it is applied to a new language, the annotation framework may have to be adapted to fit the facts of the language in question. For example, while it is reasonable to assume that the same high-level discourse relations hold across languages, it is almost certainly too much to expect that discourse relations are lexicalized in the same way across languages. When annotating discourse relations in Chinese text, we found that we have to make significant adaptations to the PDTB annotation framework that we have previously reported in (Zhou and Xue 2012 ). Qualitatively, Chinese has the same types of discourse connectives (subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, and discourse adverbials) as English. Quantitatively, however, explicit discourse connectives occur much less frequently in Chinese than they do in English, as they are often dropped. The ratio of implicit and explicit connectives is about 80/20 (Zhou and Xue 2012 ) rather than the roughly 50/50 split reported for PDTB (Prasad et al. 2008 ). This means that it is not as efficient to annotate explicit and implicit connectives in two separate steps, as they do for the PDTB Project. In addition, the sentence boundary in Chinese text is conventionalized differently as it is in English. Like English, modern Chinese also uses periods, question marks and exclamation marks to indicate sentence boundaries in text. However, the boundaries of such a conventionalized Chinese sentence may not always align with those of its English translation. A comma can sometimes be used in places where a period would be appropriate in a corresponding English sentence. To put it differently, if we assume there is a universal notion of  X  X  X entence X  X  that works the same way for both English and Chinese, the Chinese comma can sometimes also signal sentence boundaries (Xue and Yang 2011 ; Yang and Xue 2012 ). This means that we cannot annotate implicit discourse relations by just locating periods, exclamation marks and question marks, and we also have to examine commas as well. Otherwise we will overlook a significant number of legitimate discourse relations. For purposes of consistency, when we talk about  X  X  X entences X  X  in Chinese, we still mean conventionalized sentences that can be identified algorithmically by looking for periods, question marks and exclamation marks, with the understanding that  X  X  X entence X  X  is conventionalized differently for the two languages.
 The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 , we present the core PDTB annotation framework to establish a reference point for our actual Chinese annotation methodology. In Sect. 3 we outline the linguistic characteristics of Chinese discourse connectives and punctuation marks and discuss how they impact our annotation approach. In Sect. 4 we describe our annotation procedure as well as our approach to annotate the arguments of a discourse relation and its semantic type. Section 5 presents the outcome of annotation effort, a corpus of 164 documents (about 70K words) with 5,534 discourse relations. We also present annotation agreement statistics for this corpus. In Sect. 6 , we discuss related work. Section 7 concludes this article. 2 Penn Discourse TreeBank In this section, we outline the core elements of the Penn Discourse TreeBank annotation framework. The building blocks of the Penn Discourse TreeBank annotation are discourse relations that consist of a predicate taking two arguments. The predicates are discourse connectives that relate two arguments that are abstract objects such as events, propositions or situations. Syntactically, the arguments are typically realized as clauses although they can also be realized as noun phrases that denote events or situations. The arity of the discourse connective is always two, that is, a discourse connective always takes two arguments. The PDTB makes the distinction between two types of discourse relations, explicit and implicit discourse relations. The PDTB annotates explicit and implicit discourse relations separately following slightly different procedures, but the fundamental paradigm of one predicate taking two arguments is maintained. The PDTB also annotates the attribution of the predicate as well as its arguments, but for now we will gloss over this aspect of the annotation due to the limitation of resources. 2.1 Explicit discourse relations Explicit discourse relations are those anchored by explicit discourse connectives in text. When annotating an explicit discourse relation, the discourse connective anchoring the discourse relation must be first identified. The PDTB recognizes three different types of discourse connectives as characterized by their syntactic function:  X  Subordinating conjunctions: e.g.,  X  X  X ecause X  X ,  X  X  X hen X  X ,  X  X  X ince X  X ,  X  X  X lthough X  X ;  X  Coordinating conjunctions: e.g.,  X  X  X nd X  X ,  X  X  X r X  X ,  X  X  X or X  X ;  X  Discourse adverbials: e.g.,  X  X  X owever X  X ,  X  X  X therwise X  X ,  X  X  X hen X  X ,  X  X  X s a result X  X ,  X  X  X or Some discourse connectives also have non-discourse connective uses. For example,  X  X  X hen X  X  is a discourse connective when it is a subordinating conjunction introducing an adverbial phrase. It is not a discourse connective when it is a relative pronoun introducing a relative clause. Disambiguating such lexical items is part of the annotation effort. In other cases, the boundary between a discourse connective and a non-discourse connective is drawn based on annotation expediency. For example, coordinating conjunctions appearing in VP coordinations, such as  X  X  X nd X  X  in (1a), are not annotated as discourse connectives but they are considered to be discourse connectives if they connect two clauses (1b). (1) a. More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the Determining the text spans of the two arguments of a discourse connective is an important part of the annotation task. There is no limit on the length of an argument other than the Minimality Principle , which states that only as many clauses and/or sentences should be included in an argument selection as are minimally required and sufficient for the interpretation of the relation. The labels of the two arguments, ARG1 and ARG2 , are defined based on the physical location of the connective: ARG2 is the argument expressed by the clause syntactically bound to the connective, and ARG1 is the other argument. In other words, the argument labels are determined based on syntactic rather than semantic grounds. 2.2 Implicit discourse relations Implicit discourse relations are cases where an explicit discourse connective is not present, but a discourse relation can nevertheless be inferred. In actual annotation, the first question that needs to be answered is where such implicit discourse relations should be inferred in the absence of explicit discourse connectives. Due to the inevitable time and resource constraints, to make the annotation task practical, some restrictions must be placed on the  X  X  X nnotation space X  X , possible places where discourse relations can be inferred. The PDTB annotation relies on sentence boundaries, and they can be easily identified in English by looking for periods, question marks and exclamation marks. In addition, semi-colons are also considered but commas are not. To further narrow down the possible discourse relations, the PDTB also imposes the adjacency constraint : At least some part of the spans selected for ARG1 and ARG2 must belong to the pair of adjacent sentences initially identified for annotation. In addition, implicit relations across a paragraph boundary are not annotated.

After the locale of the implicit discourse relation is determined, the annotator is asked to insert a discourse connective that best conveys the implicit discourse relation. When no such connective is appropriate, the annotator is asked to assign a label that indicates one of the three possibilities:  X  AltLex: when insertion of a connective leads to redundancy due to the presence  X  EntRel: when the only relation between the two arguments is that they describe  X  NoRel: when neither a lexicalized discourse relation nor entity-based coherence (2) And she further stunned her listeners by revealing her secret garden design (3) [ Arg1 Hale Milgrim, 41 years old, senior vice president, marketing at Elecktra 2.3 Senses of the discourse connectives Discourse connectives, whether originally present in the data in the case of explicit relations, or filled in by annotators in the case of implicit relations, along with text spans marked as  X  X  X ltLex X  X , are annotated with respect to their senses or semantic type. In the PDTB, the senses are defined by an hierarchical ontology of discourse relations. There are three levels in this hierarchy:  X  Class: There are four major semantic classes: TEMPORAL, CONTINGENCY,  X  Type: A second level of types is further defined for each semantic class. For  X  Subtype: A third level of subtypes is defined for some, but not all, types. For It is worth noting that a type of implicit relation, namely those labeled as  X  X  X ntRel X  X , is not part of this sense hierarchy. 3 Discourse relation anchors in Chinese: discourse connectives and punctuation marks In this section, we present an overview of Chinese discourse connectives as well as punctuation marks that serve as  X  X  X riggers X  X  for the annotation of implicit discourse relations. We show that while Chinese has similar types of discourse connectives as English, they have different syntactic and statistical distributions and lexical realizations that have to be factored into a strategy of how to annotate Chinese discourse relations. We also show that sentence boundaries in Chinese text are not conventionalized in the same way as they are in English due to the different functions of the punctuation marks, but in general, punctuation marks are good indicators of discourse unit boundaries. This has implications on how discourse relations are annotated as well. 3.1 Explicit discourse connectives 3.1.1 Types of explicit discourse connectives Chinese has similar types of explicit discourse connectives as English: subordinat-ing conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, discourse adverbials. In addition, Chinese also has  X  X  X ocalizers X  X , a type of postpositions, that can sometimes be used as discourse connectives. Discourse relations can also be alternatively lexicalized in some cases.

Subordinating conjunctions : There are two types of subordinating conjunctions in Chinese by their lexical realization, single and paired . With single subordinating conjunctions, the subordinating conjunction introduces the subordinate clause, as in (4). The subordinate clause generally precedes the main clause in Chinese, but sometimes it can also follow the main clause (4) Chinese also abounds in paired subordinating conjunctions, where the subordinating conjunction introduces the subordinate clause and another discourse connective introduces the main clause, as in (5). (5) Coordinating conjunctions : The second type of explicit discourse connectives is coordinating conjunctions. Like subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions can either be single (6a) or paired (6b) 1 : (6) a. Adverbial connectives : The third type of explicit discourse connectives are discourse adverbials. A discourse adverbial differs from other adverbs in that they relate back to an antecedent that is a proposition or a set of related propositions. (7) Localizers : Localizers are a class of words that occur after clauses or noun phrases to denote temporal or spatial relations. They can introduce a subordinate clause by themselves or together with a preposition. While the preposition is optional, the localizer is not. When both the preposition and the localizer are present, they form a paired discourse connective and anchor a discourse relation as a whole. Example (8) shows the preposition and the localizer form a paired discourse connective equivalent to the English subordinating conjunction  X  X  X hen X  X . (8) Alternative lexicalization Discourse connectives such as subordinating and coordinating conjunctions, discourse adverbials or localizers form a close set and they are generally easy to identify. Discourse relations can also be achieved using other linguistic expressions that are hard to characterize, and these are called alternative lexicalizations in PDTB terms. For example, ( X  X  X hat is even more striking X  X ) is not a discourse connective but it signals a discourse relation between the two arguments: ARG2 is a progression of ARG1 in significance. (9) In our annotation, we have also expanded cases of AltLex to include a small number of verbs that indicate discourse relations. These verbs are all variants of the Chinese verb ( X  X  X ause, lead to X  X ), which generally introduces a causal relation between two propositions or situations and this is illustrated in (10). (10) 3.1.2 Connective sense disambiguation Like English, some lexical items in Chinese can be used as both a discourse connective and a non-discourse connective, and one discourse connective can have different senses and anchor different discourse relations. The examples in (11) show the different senses of , which can be translated into  X  X  X hile X  X  (11a),  X  X  X nd X  X  (11b) and  X  X  X nstead X  X  (11c). Note that in (11c) it is important for the first argument to be negated by  X  X  X ot X  X . In (11d), however, it is not a discourse connective. It does not seem to contribute any meaning to the sentence and is just there to satisfy a prosodic constraint that makes the sentence read more natural. (11) a. 3.1.3 The syntactic distribution of discourse connectives In Chinese, discourse connectives are generally clause-initial or clause-medial, although localizers are clause-final. Subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions and discourse adverbials can all occur in clause-initial as well as clause-medial positions. The distribution of the discourse connectives is not uniform, and varies from discourse connective to discourse connective. Some discourse connectives alternate between clause-initial and clause-medial positions. The examples in (12) show that ( X  X  X ven though X  X ), which forms a paired connective with ( X  X  X ut X  X ), occurs in both clause-initial (12a) and clause-medial (12b) positions. The distribution of subordinating conjunctions, in particular, is different from that of their English counterpart in that the latter almost always occur in clause-initial positions. (12) a. 3.2 Implicit discourse relations and punctuation marks The presence of an explicit discourse connective is a clear signal for the existence of a discourse relation, but not all discourse relations can be identified by looking for discourse connectives. Like English, in many cases, a discourse relation can be inferred even in the absence of a discourse connective. In (13), for example, there is clearly a contrast relation between the two statements separated by the semicolon, even though there is not a connective. (13) To make the annotation task practical, when annotating implicit discourse relations, there clearly have to be some restrictions on where implicit discourse relations can be inferred to make the annotation task manageable. As we have discussed in Sect. 6 , the PDTB approach is to impose the adjacency constraint and limit the annotation of implicit discourse relations to adjacent sentences. There is no attempt to annotate intra-sentential implicit discourse relations due to the limitation of available resources. The only exception is made for clauses separated by semi-colons. Such a strategy crucially hinges on the assumption that sentence boundaries can be reliably identified, an assumption that largely holds up for English. Sentence boundaries in English can be identified by looking for periods, question marks and exclamation marks. In Chinese, however, the sentence boundary is conventionalized differently and there are problems if this strategy is applied without modification to the annotation of Chinese implicit discourse relations. This is illustrated in (14): (14) This sentence reports on how a pilot program worked in Dongguan City. Because all that is said is about the pilot program, it is perfectly natural to include it all in a single sentence in Chinese. Intuitively though, there are two different aspects of how the pilot program worked: the number of records and the response from the affected companies. To report the same facts in English, it is more natural to break them down into two sentences or two semi-colon-separated clauses, but in Chinese, not only are they merely separated by comma, but also there is no connective relating them. If we apply the PDTB annotation strategy to the English translation, regardless of whether the two pieces of facts are expressed in two sentences or two semi-colon-separated clauses, at least one discourse relation will be annotated, relating these two text units. In contrast, if we apply the same strategy to the Chinese sentence, no discourse relation will be picked out because this is just one comma-separated sentence with no explicit discourse connectives in it. In other words, the discourse relation within the Chinese sentence, which would be captured in its English counterpart following the PDTB procedure, would be lost when annotating Chinese. Such loss is not a sporadic occurrence but rather a very prevalent one since it is associated with the customary writing style of Chinese. To ensure that we do not overlook such discourse relations, we need to consider comma-delimited intra-sentential implicit relations when annotating Chinese text.
Annotating comma-delimited intra-sentential implicit discourse relations means that we have to disambiguate the Chinese comma because it does not always indicate a discourse relation. The first comma instance in (14), the one immediately following ( X  X  X ccording to reports X  X ), for example, clearly does not indicate a discourse relation, because the previous text is not a possible argument to a discourse relation. So it is important to exclude such comma instances as indicators of implicit discourse relations. We think, however, that disambiguating the comma in Chinese text is valuable in its own right and is a necessary step in annotating discourse relations. The comma disambiguation task is basically one of deciding whether a comma-separated chunk of text is a clause that can be a potential argument in a discourse relation.

One area of complication when performing comma disambiguation is regarding whether it is possible to reliably make the distinction between  X  X  X ree adjuncts X  X  that the PDTB does not annotate (Prasad et al. 2008 ) and clauses that the PDTB does annotate. For example, text chunks marked  X  X  X 2 X  X  and  X  X  X 4 X  X  in (14) may appear to be clear cases of free adjuncts in PDTB terms judging from their English translation but there is no clear justification for treating them as such in Chinese. This is because there is no inflectional morphology to differentiate free adjuncts from main clauses. For example, one can be reasonably certain that ( X  X  X cknowledge X  X ) functions as a verb in (14), however, there is no way to determine whether it is in a form corresponding to  X  X  X cknowledging X  X  or  X  X  X cknowledged X  X  in English. The second reason is that since Chinese is a pro-drop language, the absence or presence of the subject in a clause is not an indication of whether the clause is a main clause or a free adjunct, or whether it is part of a VP coordination without a connective. For example, in the two-sentence sequence below, the subject of (15b) is dropped since it is clearly the same as the subject of the previous sentence in (15a). (15) a. So if we take into account both the lack of differentiating morphological clues and the possibility of dropped subject,  X  X  X 4 X  X  in (14) may be literally translated as  X  X  X enerally acknowledging acceptance X  X , or  X  X (and) generally acknowledged accep-tance X  X , or  X  X (companies) generally acknowledged acceptance X  X , or  X  X (companies) generally acknowledged (they) accepted (it) X  X . Since in Chinese, there is no reliable indicator for making the distinction between main clauses and free adjuncts, or between coordination of clauses without the subject and coordination of VPs, we will not rely on these distinctions in our annotation.

Despite the fact that the Chinese comma needs to be disambiguated when annotating intra-sentential implicit discourse relations, one nice property with Chinese punctuation marks is that with few exceptions, potential arguments to discourse relations, explicit or implicit, are always delimited by punctuation marks. The same cannot be said about most of the discourse connectives, which can occur in either clause-initial or clause-medial positions. From an annotation point of view, it is desirable not to have a discourse connective in the middle of an argument, leading to discontinuous arguments. 2 In addition, as we will show in Sect. 5 , there are far fewer explicit discourse relations signaled by explicit discourse connectives than implicit discourse relations signaled by punctuation marks. These need to be taken into account when fashioning our annotation strategy. 4 Annotation methodology In this section, we will describe our annotation methodology adapted from the PDTB approach based on our observations about explicit discourse connectives and punctuation marks in Chinese. To reiterate, these observations are: (1) because the sentence boundary is less conventionalized in Chinese, we have to consider intra-sentential implicit discourse relations to ensure adequate coverage, (2) partly as a consequence of this, there are far more implicit discourse relations than explicit discourse relations, and (3) where there are explicit discourse connectives, they often occur in pairs and they can be in clause-initial or clause-medial positions. Based on these observations, we make adaptations in our annotation methodology accordingly, as compared with the PDTB approach for English. 4.1 Annotation procedure The first adaptation we made is regarding the annotation procedure. In the PDTB, explicit and implicit relations are annotated separately. When annotating explicit discourse connectives, each connective instance is identified and its arguments are then annotated. When annotating implicit discourse relations, the annotator is asked to insert a discourse connective that best conveys the implicit discourse relation between adjacent discourse units that can be identified by locating punctuation marks that indicate sentence boundaries. This annotation procedure makes sense partly because explicit connectives are abundant in English, accounting for nearly half of all discourse relations in the PDTB 2.0 (Prasad et al. 2008 ), and partly because the project evolved in stages, expanding from the more canonical case of explicit relations to implicit relations.

When annotating Chinese text, maintaining this procedural division makes much less sense. First of all, the landscape of discourse relation has been mapped out by the PDTB work, and it has been shown that the implicit discourse relations fundamentally work the same way as explicit discourse relations and it takes on the same basic structure, a predicate with two arguments. More importantly, as we will show in Sect. 5 , explicit discourse relations in Chinese only account for 22 % of all discourse relations. Setting up a separate task to cover just 22 % of the data does not seem to be very economical. So the question now is how to annotate explicit and implicit relations in one fell swoop? As we have shown in Sect. 3 ,in Chinese text, the use of a discourse connective is almost always accompanied by a punctuation mark or two (usually period and/or comma), preceding or flanking it. So a sensible solution is to rely on punctuation as the denominator between explicit and implicit relations; and in the case of explicit relations, the connective will be marked up as an attribute of the discourse relation. For paired connectives, this means that both connectives will be marked as the attribute, but there is one discourse relation that will be annotated. This unified approach simplifies the annotation procedure while preserving the explicit/implicit distinction in the process. 4.2 Definition of argument labels Having an overwhelming number of implicit relations in the data and a substantial number of paired connectives also affects how ARG1 and ARG2 should be defined. As mentioned in Sect. 6 , discourse relations in the PDTB annotation framework are viewed as a predicate with two arguments. These two arguments are defined based on the physical location of the connective in the PDTB: ARG2 is the argument expressed by the clause syntactically bound to the connective and ARG1 is the other argument. In the case of implicit relations, the label is assigned according to the text order. Assigning argument labels based on text order means there is no substance to the argument label itself, because the same argument might appear in different textual positions. In an annotation task where implicit relations constitute an overwhelming majority, the distinction between ARG1 and ARG2 is meaningless in most cases if it is simply based on text order.

In addition, as we have shown in Sect. 3 , the phenomenon of paired connectives is pre-dominant in Chinese. English has a limited number of paired connectives, e.g.,  X  X  X f..then X  X ,  X  X  X ither..or X  X , and  X  X  X n the one hand..on the other hand X  X  while in Chinese, most connectives are part of a pair. Though some can be dropped from their pair, it is considered  X  X  X roper X  X  or formal to use both. Many paired connectives in Chinese do not have a paired English counterpart, and two such examples are presented in (16): (16) a. With paired connectives, it is no longer possible to simply say that the argument bound to the connective is ARG2 and the other one is ARG1 . We either need to define the arguments syntactically and say the subordinate clause is ARG2 , which is difficult to do for implicit discourse relations which is between two sentences, or define it semantically. Defining the arguments semantically unifies how arguments are defined for both explicit and implicit discourse relations. It will not create too much additional work beyond the distinction of different senses of discourse relation in the PDTB, which has to be done in any case. For example, in the semantic type CONTINGENCY:Cause, we can define  X  X  X eason X  X  as ARG1 and  X  X  X esult X  X  as ARG2 . In this scheme, no matter which one of ( X  X  X ecause X  X ) and ( X  X  X herefore X  X ) appears without the other, or if they appear as a pair in a sentence, or if the relation is implicit, the ARG1 and ARG2 labels will be consistently assigned to the same clauses. This obviously does not apply to symmetrical discourse relations such as Conjunction, where arguments are still labeled based on text order. That is, ARG1 is the argument that occurs first in the text, and ARG2 is the other argument. 4.3 Annotation of senses In the PDTB, annotators are asked to insert a discourse connective that best conveys the implicit discourse relation between two adjacent discourse units. When no such connective expression is appropriate, the implicit discourse relation is further distinguished as  X  X  X ltLex X  X ,  X  X  X ntRel X  X , or  X  X  X oRel X  X . The inserted connectives and those marked as  X  X  X ltLex X  X , along with explicit discourse connectives, are further annotated with respect to their senses. In the PDTB, the senses of the discourse connectives form a three-level semantic hierarchy of discourse relations, as described in Sect. 6 . When a connective needs to be inserted in a majority of cases as is the case with Chinese, the difficulty of the task really stands out. In many cases, the wording rejects the insertion of a connective even if it expresses the right underlying discourse relation. So to try to insert a connective expression may very well be too hard a task for annotators. This seems to be the case for English as well. The inter-annotator agreement for providing an explicit connective in place of an implicit one is computed based on the semantic type of explicit connectives (e.g. cause-effect relations, temporal relations, contrastive relations, etc.), rather than based on their textual identity (Miltsakaki et al. 2004 ). This suggests that a reasonable degree of agreement for such a task can only be reached with a coarse classification scheme.

Given this consideration, our solution is to annotate implicit discourse relations with their senses directly, bypassing the step of inserting a connective expression. The main motivation for inserting discourse connectives when annotating implicit discourse relations stems from the concern that it might be too hard to train annotators to reason about pre-defined abstract relations with high reliability (Prasad et al. 2008 ). This difficulty can be overcome by associating each semantic type with one or two prototypical explicit connectives and asking annotators to consider each to see if it expresses the implicit discourse relation. This way, annotators have a concrete aid to reason about abstract relations without having to choose one connective from a set expressing roughly the same relation or having to worry about whether insertion of the connective is somehow awkward.

It should be noted that annotating implicit relations directly with their semantic type means that sense annotation is no longer restricted to those that can be lexically expressed, but also includes those that cannot, notably those labeled  X  X  X ntRel/NoRel X  X  in the PDTB. In other words, we annotate senses of discourse relations, not just connectives and their lexical alternatives (in the case of AltLex). 4.4 Semantic types of discourse relations Different from the PDTB X  X  three-level sense hierarchy described in Sect. 6 ,we have adopted a flat, 11-valued classification scheme. A flatter sense structure is a direct consequence of defining the arguments semantically. For example, in the PDTB sense hierarchy,  X  X  X eason X  X  and  X  X  X esult X  X  are subtypes under type CONTIN-GENCY:Cause:  X  X  X eason X  X  applies to connectives like  X  X  X ecause X  X  and  X  X  X ince X  X  while distinction is syntactic in nature and encodes the order of the two arguments. Since we define the argument labels semantically, this information is now manifested in the argument labels (i.e., ARG1 and ARG2 . There is no longer any need for further division under CONTINGENCY:Cause since both types of connectives express the same underlying discourse relation when we move to annotating senses of discourse relations instead of specific discourse connectives.

Merging the subtypes in the PDTB sense hierarchy does not in itself lead to a completely flat structure, and there is another consideration for the decision to make the sense structure absolutely flat. The PDTB allows annotators to use the higher-level label when a finer distinction cannot be made. For example, in the PDTB sense hierarchy,  X  X  X ause X  X  and  X  X  X ondition X  X  are two types under the class CONTINGENCY, so if the annotator cannot decide between  X  X  X ause X  X  and  X  X  X ondition X  X , they can go up one level and use the class label  X  X  X ONTIN-GENCY X  X . Although this allowance is very reasonable, it increases the number of choices that an annotator has to make in practice: not just the choice between the two types, but also the choice between the two levels. For example, when faced with the uncertainty between  X  X  X ause X  X  and  X  X  X ondition X  X , the annotator now has three options:  X  X  X ause X  X ,  X  X  X ondition X  X  and  X  X  X ONTINGENCY X  X . By eliminating the higher-level CONTINGENCY, the choice is between  X  X  X ause X  X  and  X  X  X onditional X  X , which is a truthful reflection of the choice the annotator faces.

In addition to making the sense structure flat, we have also adjusted the sense type inventory based on the Chinese data. On the one hand, we consolidated some of the fine distinctions made in the PDTB, for example,  X  X  X ause X  X  is merged with  X  X  X ragmatic Cause X  X .  X  X  X ist X  X  is folded into  X  X  X onjunction X  X . These merges were effected when two fine distinctions were often hard to make in annotation, and there was a substantial degree of confusion between them in the preliminary annotation results. On the other hand, we have also added some new semantic types. For example, we have added  X  X  X rogression X  X  and  X  X  X urpose X  X . These are highly motivated in Chinese. This adjustment gave rise to eleven semantic types in the inventory for Chinese.

These eleven semantic types, in practice, are each associated with a prototypical discourse connective, with ARG1 and ARG2 properly positioned. For example,  X  X  X ausation X  X  is associated with ( X  X  X ecause X  X ) [ARG1] to the annotator along with the semantic type label for two purposes: (1) to concretely show the semantic definition of the two argument labels for each semantic type; (2) to help annotators reason about implicit discourse relations. Given that implicit discourse relations are overwhelmingly abundant in Chinese, it is necessary to provide a prototypical connective to help the annotator think about the sense of the relation. This practice is made easier by a flat structure in the organization of the senses. If the senses are hierarchically organized, each semantic type at the upper level of the hierarchy would be associated with multiple discourse connectives, and it would probably provide more confusion than aid.

Below we define the set of eleven semantic types along with their associated prototypical connectives, each illustrated with an example.
Alternative : Relation between two alternatives. Prototypical connective: (17) Causation : Relation between cause and effect. Prototypical connective: (18) Conditional : relation between a supposed condition and a supposed result. Prototypical connective: ( X  X  X f X  X ) [ ARG1 ] ( X  X  X hen X  X ) [ ARG2 ]. (19) Conjunction : Relation between two equal-status statements serving a common sense. Prototypical connective: [ ARG1 ] ( X  X  X nd X  X ) [ ARG2 ].
 (20) Contrast : Relation between two statements, co-occurrence of which seems contradictory, counter-intuitive, out-of-ordinary, etc. Prototypical connective: ( X  X  X lthough X  X ) [ ARG1 ] ( X  X  X ut X  X ) [ ARG2 ]. (21) Expansion : relation in which one argument is an elaboration or restatement of another. Prototypical connective: [ ARG1 ] ( X  X  X or example X  X ) [ ARG2 ]. (22) Purpose : Relation between an action and the intention behind it. Prototypical connective: ( X  X  X hrough X  X ) [ ARG1 ] ( X  X  X n order to X  X ) [ ARG2 ]. (23) Temporal : Relation that is temporal in nature, expressing temporal precedence, etc. Prototypical connectives: [ ARG1 ] ( X  X  X t X  X ) [ ARG2 ] ( X  X  X efore X  X ), [ ARG2 ] ( X  X  X t X  X ) [ ARG1 ] . In a synchronous relation, as in the case in (24), ARG1 and ARG2 are defined in text order.
 (24) Progression : Relation in which one argument represents a progression from the other, in extent, intensity, scale, etc. Prototypical connective: ( X  X  X ot only X  X ) [ ARG1 ] ( X  X  X ut also X  X ) [ ARG2 ]. (25) EntRel : Relation between two statements that are connected only by the fact that they are about the same entity or entities. (26) NoRel : No relation can be inferred between two adjacent discourse units. (27) When no obvious relation can be inferred between two adjacent sentences, as is the case in Example (27), it is often the case that the second argument is related in some way to text beyond the immediate previous sentence. Due to the limitation of resources, we currently do not look beyond the immediate previous sentence unless it is at least part of the argument to the discourse relation in question. 5 Corpus statistics and annotation evaluation 5.1 Corpus statistics We have completed the annotation of the discourse relations in 164 documents (about 70K words) 3 selected from the Chinese TreeBank (Xue et al. 2005 ). The Chinese TreeBank Project was first initiated at the University of Pennsylvania in 1998, and later moved to the University of Colorado at Boulder. It is currently under expansion at Brandeis University. As of this writing, eight versions of the Chinese TreeBank corpus have been released from the Linguistic Data Consortium, and the latest version, the Chinese TreeBank 8.0, consists of Xinhua newswire, Hong Kong news articles, Sinorama news magazine articles, broadcast news, broadcast conversations from various news outlets, weblogs and discussion forums. It has 1.6 million words, which have all been segmented into word tokens, tagged with part-of-speech (POS) information and Penn TreeBank-style constituent structures. The entire Chinese TreeBank has also been annotated with semantic roles as part of the Chinese Proposition Bank Project (Xue and Palmer 2009 ). The discourse annotation we describe in this article can be viewed as an additional layer of annotation to the Chinese TreeBank corpus. As such, all the discourse information, such as the text spans of the connectives and their arguments, are indexed to the word tokens in the underlying corpus. This way, the discourse connectives can be easily identified by their POS tag, and the arguments correspond to clauses and sentences in the Chinese TreeBank.
 The 164 documents we selected are from the Xinhua Newswire portion of the Chinese TreeBank, which was the first data genre annotated in the Chinese TreeBank Project. There are 256 total explicit connectives, and 132 of them are paired. As we have described in Sect. 3 , they are realized as subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, discourse adverbials, and localizers, each of which corresponds to a POS tag. Determining whether a connective is single or paired can sometimes be tricky, as a single connective can also be viewed as paired connective with one part of the connective missing but still expressing the same discourse relation. For example, the paired connective one connective that has different variations. For accounting purposes here, they are computed as separate discourse connective types, but they are obviously related.

Table 1 shows the distribution of discourse relations. 5,534 discourse relations are annotated, and 75.8 % of the discourse relations are implicit. Only 22.1 % of the discourse relations have explicit discourse connectives. The remaining 2.1 % are alternatively lexicalized, meaning that they are realized with expressions that are not canonical discourse connectives.

Table 2 shows the distribution of discourse relations by their sense and connective type.  X  X  X onjunction X  X  is by far the most frequent sense, with 3,418 discourse relation bearing this sense, followed by  X  X  X xpansion X  X , which has 895 instances. There are relatively fewer other types of discourse relations. We suspect that genre plays a role in the distribution of the semantic types. An  X  X  X xpansion X  X  relation generally consists of a general or conclusive statement followed or preceded by some examples or explantations. This is very typical of the kind of articles we have annotated. We suspect that the distribution could be quite different for another genre. It is also interesting to see that discourse relations of different senses have different tendencies of being realized as explicit or implicit discourse relations. While  X  X  X lternative X  X ,  X  X  X onditional X  X ,  X  X  X ontrast X  X ,  X  X  X rogression X  X ,  X  X  X urpose X  X ,  X  X  X emporal X  X  relations are more often associated with an explicit connective than not,  X  X  X onjunction X  X  and  X  X  X xpansion X  X  relations are overwhelmingly implicit. These statistics can be taken advantage of in an automatic relation sense determination task.

As we discussed in Sect. 1 , in the PDTB annotation framework, each discourse relation is annotated independently without attempting to consider the high-level global discourse structure, one discourse relation can still be connected to another as a consequence of selecting the text spans for the arguments of a discourse connective, implicit or explicit. For example, the text span of one discourse relation may be embedded in the arguments of another discourse relation. There can also be partial overlaps between the text spans of different discourse relations. Based on our calculation, out of the 5,534 total discourse relations we annotated, 4,995 of them are properly embedded in another relation, and 2,937 relations have another discourse relations embedded in them. Note these two numbers are not equal because some discourse relations may embed more than one discourse relation. 3,273 of all discourse relations partially overlap with another. The example below illustrates how one discourse relation can be connected to another: (28) a. There are three discourse relations relating four discourse segments in (28), and their relationships are illustrated in Fig. 1 . Relation  X  X  X onn2 X  X  is embedded in both Relations  X  X  X onn1 X  X  and  X  X  X onn3 X  X  because the relation as a whole is Arg1 for  X  X  X onn1 X  X  and Arg2 for  X  X  X onn2 X  X . This also means that  X  X  X onn1 X  X  and  X  X  X onn3 X  X  partially overlap with each other because they share one argument. 5.2 Annotation evaluation Our annotation procedure is one of double-blind annotation and adjudication. That is, a document is first double-annotated by two annotators who do not look at each other X  X  annotation. When the document is done, it is checked by the adjudicator, a third more experienced annotator who reconciles the differences if there are any. The annotation is performed using the PDTB annotation tool. 4 All of the 164 documents are double annotated and adjudicated, so we can compute agreement statistics for purposes of annotation evaluation.

As we have discussed in Sect. 4 , we annotate explicit and implicit relations in one pass rather than separately in two passes. Potential discourse relations are identified by examining the punctuation marks in the text. There are a number of decisions that the annotator has to make at each punctuation instance. 5 The first one is to determine whether a discourse relation exists (a step we call  X  X  X elation identification X  X ). Once a discourse relation is identified, the annotator needs to classify the type as one of  X  X  X xplicit X  X ,  X  X  X mplicit X  X , or  X  X  X ltLex X  X  (a step we call  X  X  X elation type classification X  X ). As should be clear from Table 3 , these two steps can be performed with high inter-annotator consistency with an agreement of 94.8 and 95.2 % respectively.

Another decision that the annotator has to make is the semantic type or the  X  X  X ense X  X  of the discourse relation. As we have discussed in Sect. 4 , in the case of implicit discourse relations, we bypass the step of inserting a connective and classify the semantic type directly. To help annotators think about semantic type, we associate each semantic type with a prototypical discourse connective e.g.,  X  X  X ausation: ARG2 X  X  ( X  X  X ausation: because ARG1 therefore ARG2 X  X ). This approach works well, as evidenced by 84.5 % agreement. 6 The top 10 sense pairs that are easiest to confuse with one another are presented in Table 4 . From the table, we can see that  X  X  X onjunction X  X  is the most frequent sense and it is also the one that is the easiest to confuse with other senses.

We calculate two measures for the agreement on argument spans and both measures group explicit and implicit discourse relations together. The first measure is based on exact match, where each argument span is treated as a separate token, and there is a match only if both boundaries of the argument match. The agreement is computed as the number of matched argument spans between the two annotators divided by the total number of discourse relations both annotators picked. By this measure, the accuracy is 77.1 %. The second measure treats each argument boundary as a separate token, so represents a partial span match. Typically, an argument span has two boundaries, but it can have four (or more) boundaries when an argument span is discontinuous and interrupted by a connective and/or an AltLex item. This metric is less stringent than exact match but more stringent than the partial match used by the PDTB (Miltsakaki et al. 2004 ) where as long as one boundary matches it counts as a match for the argument. We computed the precision, recall and F1-score for this measure. The precision is the number of matched argument boundaries divided by the total number of boundaries proposed by one annotator and the recall is the number of matched argument boundaries divided by the total number of boundaries proposed by the other annotator. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. By this metric, the precision is 0.88, the recall is 0.883, and the F1-measure is 0.881. The argument span agreement statistics show that determining the boundaries of an argument is a challenging aspect of discourse annotation. (29) is an example where two annotators agree on the span of ARG1 but not ARG2. This is a  X  X  X onjunction X  X  relation anchored by a comma, and one annotator includes an extra clause as part of ARG2. The correct annotation is to exclude it from ARG2. This type of annotation decisions are similar to the attachment decisions in the annotation of the syntactic structure of a sentence and it is an area where disagreements are more likely to occur. (29) 6 Related work There now exist a range of different discourse annotation frameworks for natural language text, reflecting different conceptions of the discourse structure of a text. The RST Discourse TreeBank (Carlson et al. 2003 ), based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson 1988 ), is committed to recursively building a tree structure for the discourse, using non-overlapping contiguous text spans called EDUs as basic building blocks. Both the Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) (Asher and Lascarides 2003 ) and the Discourse Graph Bank (Wolf and Gibson 2005 ) view the discourse structure of a text as a directed graph where nodes are discourse segments or groups of discourse segments, and labeled directed arcs represent coherence relations. The use of a graph as a representation device opens the door for long-distance attachments as well as crossed dependencies, and this is a property shared by both SDRT and the Graph Discourse Bank annotation framework, but the former is constrained by the right frontier principle which postulates that each new EDU is attached either to the last discourse unit or to one that is superordinate to it. Annotating the discourse structure of an entire text as a single tree or graph is a complex task. It is perhaps no co-incidence that existing discourse-annotated corpora are generally small, with perhaps the exception of the PDTB. As we discussed in Sect. 1 , we adopted the PDTB annotation framework because it annotates independent discourse relations and does not a priori assume a single connected structure for the entire text, thus reducing the cognitive load on the annotators and potentially increasing annotation speed and making it feasible for large-scale annotation. Essentially we trade off some representation expressiveness for annotation practicality.

The development of the PDTB has spawned a number of discourse annotation projects in other languages. These annotation projects are at different stages of development but they all share the same basic conception that a discourse relation is composed of a discourse connective taking two abstract objects as their arguments and treat each discourse relation independently without committing to a high-level global structure. At the same time, they all made adaptations to the PDTB annotation framework to make it better fit the language that is annotated. These adaptations fall within two main areas. The first one is what constitutes a discourse connective and what can be arguments for these discourse connectives for that language. For the Leeds Arabic Discourse TreeBank (LADT) (Al-Saif and Markert 2010 ), for example, discourse connectives include prepositions and clitics due to the rich morphology of the language. In addition to clauses and sentences, potential arguments also include  X  X  X oun sentences X  X , which is equivalent to an English clause or phrase. Similarly, the Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) (Zeyrek and Webber 2008 ; Zeyrek et al. 2009 , 2010 ), which has not yet annotated implicit discourse relations, annotates nominal arguments for subordinators which always have at least one nominal argument as well as other discourse connectives that have nominal arguments. In addition to subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, and discourse adverbials, the Hindi Discourse Relation Bank (HDRB) (Oza et al. 2009 ) also recognizes sentential relatives (relative pronouns that conjoin a relative clause and its matrix clause), subordinators (postpositions, verbal particles, and suffixes that introduce non-finite clauses with an abstract object interpretation), and described work on adding a discourse layer of annotation to the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajic  X  et al. 2003 ) centered on discourse connectives, which like English include conjunctions, subordinations, adverbs as well as some particles. The second area of adaptation is regarding the taxonomy of discourse relations. For example, like the CDTB, the HDRB also defines the arguments based on their semantics and eliminates the argument-specific labels in the discourse relations. In addition, it replaces the PDTB pragmatic senses with a uniform three-way classification. Each pragmatic sense at the type level is further distinguished into three subtypes:  X  X  X pistemic X  X ,  X  X  X peech act X  X , and  X  X  X ropositional X  X . In addition, it also adds a  X  X  X oal X  X  sense under  X  X  X ontinguency X  X . The LADT reduces the number of types to 18, and adds two other types: Expansion.Background and Comparision.Similarity. Mladova  X  of the PDTB in the discourse layer annotation for the Prague Dependency TreeBank by introducing new relations such as  X  X  X urpose X  X  and  X  X  X radation X  X .

Discourse-related annotation is still relatively rare for Chinese. The CJPL Project is based on the the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) and considers non-overlapping consecutive text spans as the basic units of discourse relations (EDUs). The CLPJ corpus consists of 97 texts from a Chinese news commentary corpus. One important difference between the CDTB annotation scheme and the CJPL annotation scheme, other than the fact that the CDTB is adapted from the PDTB annotation scheme and the CJPL corpus is based on RST, is that in the CJPL corpus, the EDUs are identified by punctuation marks such as periods, question marks, explanations, colons and semi-colons, as well as paragraph boundaries to the exclusion of commas because, as we have discussed in Sect. 3.2 , commas are ambiguous and they do not always signal the boundary of discourse units. We chose to use commas as signals for argument boundaries by disambiguating them as we believe this adds value to the annotated corpus. After all, one of the most important reasons for performing annotation is to disambiguate based on the context. Huang and Chen ( 2011 , 2012a , b ) describe pilot efforts to perform PDTB-style annotation on data selected from the Sinica TreeBank (Chen et al. 2004 ). The initial annotation (Huang and Chen 2011 ) was focused on just inter-sentential discourse relations using the upper-level relations from the PDTB taxonomy. That was later extended to intra-sentential relations (Huang and Chen 2012b ), and sentiment polarity was also added as part of the annotation (Huang and Chen 2012a ). It is not clear to us, however, whether implicit relations were annotated and whether comma was disambiguated in their annotation effort. 7 Conclusions We presented the Chinese Discourse TreeBank, a corpus annotated with PDTB-style discourse relations that take the form of a predicate with two arguments. Based on the syntactic and statistic distributions of Chinese discourse connectives as well as the distribution of punctuation marks, we made a few significant adaptations to the PDTB annotation approach. These include designing an annotation procedure where we annotate explicit and implicit discourse relations in one pass, defining the arguments based on semantic rather than syntactic grounds or textual order, and annotating the semantic type or sense of implicit discourse relations without first inserting an explicit discourse connective. We annotated a significant amount of data (164 texts, around 70 thousand words) selected from the Chinese TreeBank, and provided agreement statistics that demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.

 Abstract The paper presents the Chinese Discourse TreeBank, a corpus annotated with Penn Discourse TreeBank style discourse relations that take the form of a predicate taking two arguments. We first characterize the syntactic and statistical distributions of Chinese discourse connectives as well as the role of Chinese punctuation marks in discourse annotation, and then describe how we design our annotation strategy procedure based on this characterization. The Chinese-specific features of our annotation strategy include annotating explicit and implicit discourse relations in one single pass, defining the argument labels on semantic, rather than syntactic, grounds, as well as annotating the semantic type of implicit discourse relations directly. We also introduce a flat, 11-valued semantic type classification scheme for discourse relations. We finally demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with evaluation results.
 Keywords Discourse TreeBank Discourse relations Chinese Explicit and implicit discourse connectives 1 Introduction In a time when statistical, data-driven approaches dominate the field of computa-tional linguistics and natural language processing, a consistently annotated linguistic corpus is a crucial enabling resource that helps advance the state of the art of a particular area. For example, the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al. 1993 ) revolutionized syntactic parsing and pushed syntactic parsing performance to unprecedented levels (Collins 1999 ; Charniak 2000 ; Petrov and Klein 2007 ). The PropBank (Palmer et al. 2005 ) and FrameNet (Baker et al. 1998 ) generated a tremendous amount of research in semantic role labeling (Pradhan et al. 2004 ; Xue and Palmer 2004 ; Punyakanok et al. 2004 ; Toutanova et al. 2005 ). The TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al. 2003 ) enabled substantial amount of research in temporal processing (Mani et al. 2006 ). The successes of this general approach of  X  X  X nnotate and learn X  X  inspired the creation of similar resources in other languages (Xue et al. 2005 ; Xue and Palmer 2009 ). In this article, we describe our effort to create a Chinese Discourse TreeBank and we hope this corpus will spur the development of Chinese discourse analyzers, among its other possible uses.

The creation of a corpus annotated with discourse structures starts with identifying a well-grounded linguistic theory that can be easily operationalized and can scale up to domain-independent texts. There are many alternative conceptions of the discourse structure of natural language text (Hobbs 1985 ; Mann and Thompson 1988 ; Asher 1993 ), and some of them have been tested against empirical data and have been used to guide discourse annotation efforts (Carlson et al. 2003 ; Wolf and Gibson 2005 ). We adopted the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) (Miltsakaki et al. 2004 ; Prasad et al. 2008 ) discourse annotation framework. The PDTB annotation framework has grown out of the DLTAG (Webber and Joshi 1998 ; Webber et al. 1999 , 2003 ), a lexicalized conception of the discourse structure of a text. As is often the case, when a theoretical framework is used to guide an annotation project, the theoretical framework may need to be modified based on empirical evidence encountered in the annotation process. This is the case here. While the PDTB project preserves the fundamental assumptions of the DLTAG, it does not subscribe to all aspects of the DLTAG theoretical framework and strives to maintain a  X  X  X heory-neutral X  X  stance regarding the high-level representation of the global discourse structure of a text.

In the PDTB conception, discourse relations revolve around discourse connectives, explicit or implicit. Each discourse connective functions as a predicate and takes two arguments. The discourse connective, together with its two arguments, instantiates a discourse relation, and in this sense discourse relations are lexicalized. Lexicalization makes highly abstract discourse relations grounded to a lexical item, the discourse connective, and in doing so, it also localizes the ambiguity in discourse annotation to discourse connectives, where a lexical item can have a discourse connective use or a non-discourse connective use (e.g.,  X  X  X hen X  X ), and one discourse connective can be ambiguous between different discourse relations (e.g.,  X  X  X ince X  X ). Part of the annotation effort is devoted to resolving such ambiguity. When an explicit discourse connective is not present, the PDTB assumes that there is an implicit discourse connective that relates its two arguments, which are typically (parts of) adjacent sentences. This is operationalized by identifying punctuation marks (e.g., periods) that serve as boundaries of two adjacent sentences as anchors of implicit discourse relations. The semantic classification of the discourse relation is determined by testing which discourse connective can be plausibly inserted between these two adjacent sentences. In doing so, the PDTB assumes that (1) the range of possible discourse relations anchored by implicit discourse connectives are basically the same as those anchored by explicit discourse connectives, and (2) discourse relations anchored by implicit discourse connectives are mostly local.

By insisting that discourse relations be lexicalized, the PDTB framework reduces the cognitive load of the discourse annotation task because each annotator can focus on only one discourse connective at a time instead of having scores of discourse relations to choose from. Similarly, by focusing on local implicit discourse relations that occur between adjacent sentences, the PDTB conception of the discourse structure does not commit to a global structure for the entire text and attempt to annotate the dependencies between separate discourse relations. This means that the annotator does not have to hold the global discourse structure of the text in memory when annotating a new chunk of text. We believe that these are very attractive properties, especially for large-scale annotation projects where many annotators are involved and inter-annotator consistency is crucial to the utility of the annotation.

Although the successful annotation of the Penn Discourse TreeBank proved the feasibility of this annotation framework for English, when it is applied to a new language, the annotation framework may have to be adapted to fit the facts of the language in question. For example, while it is reasonable to assume that the same high-level discourse relations hold across languages, it is almost certainly too much to expect that discourse relations are lexicalized in the same way across languages. When annotating discourse relations in Chinese text, we found that we have to make significant adaptations to the PDTB annotation framework that we have previously reported in (Zhou and Xue 2012 ). Qualitatively, Chinese has the same types of discourse connectives (subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, and discourse adverbials) as English. Quantitatively, however, explicit discourse connectives occur much less frequently in Chinese than they do in English, as they are often dropped. The ratio of implicit and explicit connectives is about 80/20 (Zhou and Xue 2012 ) rather than the roughly 50/50 split reported for PDTB (Prasad et al. 2008 ). This means that it is not as efficient to annotate explicit and implicit connectives in two separate steps, as they do for the PDTB Project. In addition, the sentence boundary in Chinese text is conventionalized differently as it is in English. Like English, modern Chinese also uses periods, question marks and exclamation marks to indicate sentence boundaries in text. However, the boundaries of such a conventionalized Chinese sentence may not always align with those of its English translation. A comma can sometimes be used in places where a period would be appropriate in a corresponding English sentence. To put it differently, if we assume there is a universal notion of  X  X  X entence X  X  that works the same way for both English and Chinese, the Chinese comma can sometimes also signal sentence boundaries (Xue and Yang 2011 ; Yang and Xue 2012 ). This means that we cannot annotate implicit discourse relations by just locating periods, exclamation marks and question marks, and we also have to examine commas as well. Otherwise we will overlook a significant number of legitimate discourse relations. For purposes of consistency, when we talk about  X  X  X entences X  X  in Chinese, we still mean conventionalized sentences that can be identified algorithmically by looking for periods, question marks and exclamation marks, with the understanding that  X  X  X entence X  X  is conventionalized differently for the two languages.
 The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 , we present the core PDTB annotation framework to establish a reference point for our actual Chinese annotation methodology. In Sect. 3 we outline the linguistic characteristics of Chinese discourse connectives and punctuation marks and discuss how they impact our annotation approach. In Sect. 4 we describe our annotation procedure as well as our approach to annotate the arguments of a discourse relation and its semantic type. Section 5 presents the outcome of annotation effort, a corpus of 164 documents (about 70K words) with 5,534 discourse relations. We also present annotation agreement statistics for this corpus. In Sect. 6 , we discuss related work. Section 7 concludes this article. 2 Penn Discourse TreeBank In this section, we outline the core elements of the Penn Discourse TreeBank annotation framework. The building blocks of the Penn Discourse TreeBank annotation are discourse relations that consist of a predicate taking two arguments. The predicates are discourse connectives that relate two arguments that are abstract objects such as events, propositions or situations. Syntactically, the arguments are typically realized as clauses although they can also be realized as noun phrases that denote events or situations. The arity of the discourse connective is always two, that is, a discourse connective always takes two arguments. The PDTB makes the distinction between two types of discourse relations, explicit and implicit discourse relations. The PDTB annotates explicit and implicit discourse relations separately following slightly different procedures, but the fundamental paradigm of one predicate taking two arguments is maintained. The PDTB also annotates the attribution of the predicate as well as its arguments, but for now we will gloss over this aspect of the annotation due to the limitation of resources. 2.1 Explicit discourse relations Explicit discourse relations are those anchored by explicit discourse connectives in text. When annotating an explicit discourse relation, the discourse connective anchoring the discourse relation must be first identified. The PDTB recognizes three different types of discourse connectives as characterized by their syntactic function:  X  Subordinating conjunctions: e.g.,  X  X  X ecause X  X ,  X  X  X hen X  X ,  X  X  X ince X  X ,  X  X  X lthough X  X ;  X  Coordinating conjunctions: e.g.,  X  X  X nd X  X ,  X  X  X r X  X ,  X  X  X or X  X ;  X  Discourse adverbials: e.g.,  X  X  X owever X  X ,  X  X  X therwise X  X ,  X  X  X hen X  X ,  X  X  X s a result X  X ,  X  X  X or Some discourse connectives also have non-discourse connective uses. For example,  X  X  X hen X  X  is a discourse connective when it is a subordinating conjunction introducing an adverbial phrase. It is not a discourse connective when it is a relative pronoun introducing a relative clause. Disambiguating such lexical items is part of the annotation effort. In other cases, the boundary between a discourse connective and a non-discourse connective is drawn based on annotation expediency. For example, coordinating conjunctions appearing in VP coordinations, such as  X  X  X nd X  X  in (1a), are not annotated as discourse connectives but they are considered to be discourse connectives if they connect two clauses (1b). (1) a. More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the Determining the text spans of the two arguments of a discourse connective is an important part of the annotation task. There is no limit on the length of an argument other than the Minimality Principle , which states that only as many clauses and/or sentences should be included in an argument selection as are minimally required and sufficient for the interpretation of the relation. The labels of the two arguments, ARG1 and ARG2 , are defined based on the physical location of the connective: ARG2 is the argument expressed by the clause syntactically bound to the connective, and ARG1 is the other argument. In other words, the argument labels are determined based on syntactic rather than semantic grounds. 2.2 Implicit discourse relations Implicit discourse relations are cases where an explicit discourse connective is not present, but a discourse relation can nevertheless be inferred. In actual annotation, the first question that needs to be answered is where such implicit discourse relations should be inferred in the absence of explicit discourse connectives. Due to the inevitable time and resource constraints, to make the annotation task practical, some restrictions must be placed on the  X  X  X nnotation space X  X , possible places where discourse relations can be inferred. The PDTB annotation relies on sentence boundaries, and they can be easily identified in English by looking for periods, question marks and exclamation marks. In addition, semi-colons are also considered but commas are not. To further narrow down the possible discourse relations, the PDTB also imposes the adjacency constraint : At least some part of the spans selected for ARG1 and ARG2 must belong to the pair of adjacent sentences initially identified for annotation. In addition, implicit relations across a paragraph boundary are not annotated.

After the locale of the implicit discourse relation is determined, the annotator is asked to insert a discourse connective that best conveys the implicit discourse relation. When no such connective is appropriate, the annotator is asked to assign a label that indicates one of the three possibilities:  X  AltLex: when insertion of a connective leads to redundancy due to the presence  X  EntRel: when the only relation between the two arguments is that they describe  X  NoRel: when neither a lexicalized discourse relation nor entity-based coherence (2) And she further stunned her listeners by revealing her secret garden design (3) [ Arg1 Hale Milgrim, 41 years old, senior vice president, marketing at Elecktra 2.3 Senses of the discourse connectives Discourse connectives, whether originally present in the data in the case of explicit relations, or filled in by annotators in the case of implicit relations, along with text spans marked as  X  X  X ltLex X  X , are annotated with respect to their senses or semantic type. In the PDTB, the senses are defined by an hierarchical ontology of discourse relations. There are three levels in this hierarchy:  X  Class: There are four major semantic classes: TEMPORAL, CONTINGENCY,  X  Type: A second level of types is further defined for each semantic class. For  X  Subtype: A third level of subtypes is defined for some, but not all, types. For It is worth noting that a type of implicit relation, namely those labeled as  X  X  X ntRel X  X , is not part of this sense hierarchy. 3 Discourse relation anchors in Chinese: discourse connectives and punctuation marks In this section, we present an overview of Chinese discourse connectives as well as punctuation marks that serve as  X  X  X riggers X  X  for the annotation of implicit discourse relations. We show that while Chinese has similar types of discourse connectives as English, they have different syntactic and statistical distributions and lexical realizations that have to be factored into a strategy of how to annotate Chinese discourse relations. We also show that sentence boundaries in Chinese text are not conventionalized in the same way as they are in English due to the different functions of the punctuation marks, but in general, punctuation marks are good indicators of discourse unit boundaries. This has implications on how discourse relations are annotated as well. 3.1 Explicit discourse connectives 3.1.1 Types of explicit discourse connectives Chinese has similar types of explicit discourse connectives as English: subordinat-ing conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, discourse adverbials. In addition, Chinese also has  X  X  X ocalizers X  X , a type of postpositions, that can sometimes be used as discourse connectives. Discourse relations can also be alternatively lexicalized in some cases.

Subordinating conjunctions : There are two types of subordinating conjunctions in Chinese by their lexical realization, single and paired . With single subordinating conjunctions, the subordinating conjunction introduces the subordinate clause, as in (4). The subordinate clause generally precedes the main clause in Chinese, but sometimes it can also follow the main clause (4) Chinese also abounds in paired subordinating conjunctions, where the subordinating conjunction introduces the subordinate clause and another discourse connective introduces the main clause, as in (5). (5) Coordinating conjunctions : The second type of explicit discourse connectives is coordinating conjunctions. Like subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions can either be single (6a) or paired (6b) 1 : (6) a. Adverbial connectives : The third type of explicit discourse connectives are discourse adverbials. A discourse adverbial differs from other adverbs in that they relate back to an antecedent that is a proposition or a set of related propositions. (7) Localizers : Localizers are a class of words that occur after clauses or noun phrases to denote temporal or spatial relations. They can introduce a subordinate clause by themselves or together with a preposition. While the preposition is optional, the localizer is not. When both the preposition and the localizer are present, they form a paired discourse connective and anchor a discourse relation as a whole. Example (8) shows the preposition and the localizer form a paired discourse connective equivalent to the English subordinating conjunction  X  X  X hen X  X . (8) Alternative lexicalization Discourse connectives such as subordinating and coordinating conjunctions, discourse adverbials or localizers form a close set and they are generally easy to identify. Discourse relations can also be achieved using other linguistic expressions that are hard to characterize, and these are called alternative lexicalizations in PDTB terms. For example, ( X  X  X hat is even more striking X  X ) is not a discourse connective but it signals a discourse relation between the two arguments: ARG2 is a progression of ARG1 in significance. (9) In our annotation, we have also expanded cases of AltLex to include a small number of verbs that indicate discourse relations. These verbs are all variants of the Chinese verb ( X  X  X ause, lead to X  X ), which generally introduces a causal relation between two propositions or situations and this is illustrated in (10). (10) 3.1.2 Connective sense disambiguation Like English, some lexical items in Chinese can be used as both a discourse connective and a non-discourse connective, and one discourse connective can have different senses and anchor different discourse relations. The examples in (11) show the different senses of , which can be translated into  X  X  X hile X  X  (11a),  X  X  X nd X  X  (11b) and  X  X  X nstead X  X  (11c). Note that in (11c) it is important for the first argument to be negated by  X  X  X ot X  X . In (11d), however, it is not a discourse connective. It does not seem to contribute any meaning to the sentence and is just there to satisfy a prosodic constraint that makes the sentence read more natural. (11) a. 3.1.3 The syntactic distribution of discourse connectives In Chinese, discourse connectives are generally clause-initial or clause-medial, although localizers are clause-final. Subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions and discourse adverbials can all occur in clause-initial as well as clause-medial positions. The distribution of the discourse connectives is not uniform, and varies from discourse connective to discourse connective. Some discourse connectives alternate between clause-initial and clause-medial positions. The examples in (12) show that ( X  X  X ven though X  X ), which forms a paired connective with ( X  X  X ut X  X ), occurs in both clause-initial (12a) and clause-medial (12b) positions. The distribution of subordinating conjunctions, in particular, is different from that of their English counterpart in that the latter almost always occur in clause-initial positions. (12) a. 3.2 Implicit discourse relations and punctuation marks The presence of an explicit discourse connective is a clear signal for the existence of a discourse relation, but not all discourse relations can be identified by looking for discourse connectives. Like English, in many cases, a discourse relation can be inferred even in the absence of a discourse connective. In (13), for example, there is clearly a contrast relation between the two statements separated by the semicolon, even though there is not a connective. (13) To make the annotation task practical, when annotating implicit discourse relations, there clearly have to be some restrictions on where implicit discourse relations can be inferred to make the annotation task manageable. As we have discussed in Sect. 6 , the PDTB approach is to impose the adjacency constraint and limit the annotation of implicit discourse relations to adjacent sentences. There is no attempt to annotate intra-sentential implicit discourse relations due to the limitation of available resources. The only exception is made for clauses separated by semi-colons. Such a strategy crucially hinges on the assumption that sentence boundaries can be reliably identified, an assumption that largely holds up for English. Sentence boundaries in English can be identified by looking for periods, question marks and exclamation marks. In Chinese, however, the sentence boundary is conventionalized differently and there are problems if this strategy is applied without modification to the annotation of Chinese implicit discourse relations. This is illustrated in (14): (14) This sentence reports on how a pilot program worked in Dongguan City. Because all that is said is about the pilot program, it is perfectly natural to include it all in a single sentence in Chinese. Intuitively though, there are two different aspects of how the pilot program worked: the number of records and the response from the affected companies. To report the same facts in English, it is more natural to break them down into two sentences or two semi-colon-separated clauses, but in Chinese, not only are they merely separated by comma, but also there is no connective relating them. If we apply the PDTB annotation strategy to the English translation, regardless of whether the two pieces of facts are expressed in two sentences or two semi-colon-separated clauses, at least one discourse relation will be annotated, relating these two text units. In contrast, if we apply the same strategy to the Chinese sentence, no discourse relation will be picked out because this is just one comma-separated sentence with no explicit discourse connectives in it. In other words, the discourse relation within the Chinese sentence, which would be captured in its English counterpart following the PDTB procedure, would be lost when annotating Chinese. Such loss is not a sporadic occurrence but rather a very prevalent one since it is associated with the customary writing style of Chinese. To ensure that we do not overlook such discourse relations, we need to consider comma-delimited intra-sentential implicit relations when annotating Chinese text.
Annotating comma-delimited intra-sentential implicit discourse relations means that we have to disambiguate the Chinese comma because it does not always indicate a discourse relation. The first comma instance in (14), the one immediately following ( X  X  X ccording to reports X  X ), for example, clearly does not indicate a discourse relation, because the previous text is not a possible argument to a discourse relation. So it is important to exclude such comma instances as indicators of implicit discourse relations. We think, however, that disambiguating the comma in Chinese text is valuable in its own right and is a necessary step in annotating discourse relations. The comma disambiguation task is basically one of deciding whether a comma-separated chunk of text is a clause that can be a potential argument in a discourse relation.

One area of complication when performing comma disambiguation is regarding whether it is possible to reliably make the distinction between  X  X  X ree adjuncts X  X  that the PDTB does not annotate (Prasad et al. 2008 ) and clauses that the PDTB does annotate. For example, text chunks marked  X  X  X 2 X  X  and  X  X  X 4 X  X  in (14) may appear to be clear cases of free adjuncts in PDTB terms judging from their English translation but there is no clear justification for treating them as such in Chinese. This is because there is no inflectional morphology to differentiate free adjuncts from main clauses. For example, one can be reasonably certain that ( X  X  X cknowledge X  X ) functions as a verb in (14), however, there is no way to determine whether it is in a form corresponding to  X  X  X cknowledging X  X  or  X  X  X cknowledged X  X  in English. The second reason is that since Chinese is a pro-drop language, the absence or presence of the subject in a clause is not an indication of whether the clause is a main clause or a free adjunct, or whether it is part of a VP coordination without a connective. For example, in the two-sentence sequence below, the subject of (15b) is dropped since it is clearly the same as the subject of the previous sentence in (15a). (15) a. So if we take into account both the lack of differentiating morphological clues and the possibility of dropped subject,  X  X  X 4 X  X  in (14) may be literally translated as  X  X  X enerally acknowledging acceptance X  X , or  X  X (and) generally acknowledged accep-tance X  X , or  X  X (companies) generally acknowledged acceptance X  X , or  X  X (companies) generally acknowledged (they) accepted (it) X  X . Since in Chinese, there is no reliable indicator for making the distinction between main clauses and free adjuncts, or between coordination of clauses without the subject and coordination of VPs, we will not rely on these distinctions in our annotation.

Despite the fact that the Chinese comma needs to be disambiguated when annotating intra-sentential implicit discourse relations, one nice property with Chinese punctuation marks is that with few exceptions, potential arguments to discourse relations, explicit or implicit, are always delimited by punctuation marks. The same cannot be said about most of the discourse connectives, which can occur in either clause-initial or clause-medial positions. From an annotation point of view, it is desirable not to have a discourse connective in the middle of an argument, leading to discontinuous arguments. 2 In addition, as we will show in Sect. 5 , there are far fewer explicit discourse relations signaled by explicit discourse connectives than implicit discourse relations signaled by punctuation marks. These need to be taken into account when fashioning our annotation strategy. 4 Annotation methodology In this section, we will describe our annotation methodology adapted from the PDTB approach based on our observations about explicit discourse connectives and punctuation marks in Chinese. To reiterate, these observations are: (1) because the sentence boundary is less conventionalized in Chinese, we have to consider intra-sentential implicit discourse relations to ensure adequate coverage, (2) partly as a consequence of this, there are far more implicit discourse relations than explicit discourse relations, and (3) where there are explicit discourse connectives, they often occur in pairs and they can be in clause-initial or clause-medial positions. Based on these observations, we make adaptations in our annotation methodology accordingly, as compared with the PDTB approach for English. 4.1 Annotation procedure The first adaptation we made is regarding the annotation procedure. In the PDTB, explicit and implicit relations are annotated separately. When annotating explicit discourse connectives, each connective instance is identified and its arguments are then annotated. When annotating implicit discourse relations, the annotator is asked to insert a discourse connective that best conveys the implicit discourse relation between adjacent discourse units that can be identified by locating punctuation marks that indicate sentence boundaries. This annotation procedure makes sense partly because explicit connectives are abundant in English, accounting for nearly half of all discourse relations in the PDTB 2.0 (Prasad et al. 2008 ), and partly because the project evolved in stages, expanding from the more canonical case of explicit relations to implicit relations.

When annotating Chinese text, maintaining this procedural division makes much less sense. First of all, the landscape of discourse relation has been mapped out by the PDTB work, and it has been shown that the implicit discourse relations fundamentally work the same way as explicit discourse relations and it takes on the same basic structure, a predicate with two arguments. More importantly, as we will show in Sect. 5 , explicit discourse relations in Chinese only account for 22 % of all discourse relations. Setting up a separate task to cover just 22 % of the data does not seem to be very economical. So the question now is how to annotate explicit and implicit relations in one fell swoop? As we have shown in Sect. 3 ,in Chinese text, the use of a discourse connective is almost always accompanied by a punctuation mark or two (usually period and/or comma), preceding or flanking it. So a sensible solution is to rely on punctuation as the denominator between explicit and implicit relations; and in the case of explicit relations, the connective will be marked up as an attribute of the discourse relation. For paired connectives, this means that both connectives will be marked as the attribute, but there is one discourse relation that will be annotated. This unified approach simplifies the annotation procedure while preserving the explicit/implicit distinction in the process. 4.2 Definition of argument labels Having an overwhelming number of implicit relations in the data and a substantial number of paired connectives also affects how ARG1 and ARG2 should be defined. As mentioned in Sect. 6 , discourse relations in the PDTB annotation framework are viewed as a predicate with two arguments. These two arguments are defined based on the physical location of the connective in the PDTB: ARG2 is the argument expressed by the clause syntactically bound to the connective and ARG1 is the other argument. In the case of implicit relations, the label is assigned according to the text order. Assigning argument labels based on text order means there is no substance to the argument label itself, because the same argument might appear in different textual positions. In an annotation task where implicit relations constitute an overwhelming majority, the distinction between ARG1 and ARG2 is meaningless in most cases if it is simply based on text order.

In addition, as we have shown in Sect. 3 , the phenomenon of paired connectives is pre-dominant in Chinese. English has a limited number of paired connectives, e.g.,  X  X  X f..then X  X ,  X  X  X ither..or X  X , and  X  X  X n the one hand..on the other hand X  X  while in Chinese, most connectives are part of a pair. Though some can be dropped from their pair, it is considered  X  X  X roper X  X  or formal to use both. Many paired connectives in Chinese do not have a paired English counterpart, and two such examples are presented in (16): (16) a. With paired connectives, it is no longer possible to simply say that the argument bound to the connective is ARG2 and the other one is ARG1 . We either need to define the arguments syntactically and say the subordinate clause is ARG2 , which is difficult to do for implicit discourse relations which is between two sentences, or define it semantically. Defining the arguments semantically unifies how arguments are defined for both explicit and implicit discourse relations. It will not create too much additional work beyond the distinction of different senses of discourse relation in the PDTB, which has to be done in any case. For example, in the semantic type CONTINGENCY:Cause, we can define  X  X  X eason X  X  as ARG1 and  X  X  X esult X  X  as ARG2 . In this scheme, no matter which one of ( X  X  X ecause X  X ) and ( X  X  X herefore X  X ) appears without the other, or if they appear as a pair in a sentence, or if the relation is implicit, the ARG1 and ARG2 labels will be consistently assigned to the same clauses. This obviously does not apply to symmetrical discourse relations such as Conjunction, where arguments are still labeled based on text order. That is, ARG1 is the argument that occurs first in the text, and ARG2 is the other argument. 4.3 Annotation of senses In the PDTB, annotators are asked to insert a discourse connective that best conveys the implicit discourse relation between two adjacent discourse units. When no such connective expression is appropriate, the implicit discourse relation is further distinguished as  X  X  X ltLex X  X ,  X  X  X ntRel X  X , or  X  X  X oRel X  X . The inserted connectives and those marked as  X  X  X ltLex X  X , along with explicit discourse connectives, are further annotated with respect to their senses. In the PDTB, the senses of the discourse connectives form a three-level semantic hierarchy of discourse relations, as described in Sect. 6 . When a connective needs to be inserted in a majority of cases as is the case with Chinese, the difficulty of the task really stands out. In many cases, the wording rejects the insertion of a connective even if it expresses the right underlying discourse relation. So to try to insert a connective expression may very well be too hard a task for annotators. This seems to be the case for English as well. The inter-annotator agreement for providing an explicit connective in place of an implicit one is computed based on the semantic type of explicit connectives (e.g. cause-effect relations, temporal relations, contrastive relations, etc.), rather than based on their textual identity (Miltsakaki et al. 2004 ). This suggests that a reasonable degree of agreement for such a task can only be reached with a coarse classification scheme.

Given this consideration, our solution is to annotate implicit discourse relations with their senses directly, bypassing the step of inserting a connective expression. The main motivation for inserting discourse connectives when annotating implicit discourse relations stems from the concern that it might be too hard to train annotators to reason about pre-defined abstract relations with high reliability (Prasad et al. 2008 ). This difficulty can be overcome by associating each semantic type with one or two prototypical explicit connectives and asking annotators to consider each to see if it expresses the implicit discourse relation. This way, annotators have a concrete aid to reason about abstract relations without having to choose one connective from a set expressing roughly the same relation or having to worry about whether insertion of the connective is somehow awkward.

It should be noted that annotating implicit relations directly with their semantic type means that sense annotation is no longer restricted to those that can be lexically expressed, but also includes those that cannot, notably those labeled  X  X  X ntRel/NoRel X  X  in the PDTB. In other words, we annotate senses of discourse relations, not just connectives and their lexical alternatives (in the case of AltLex). 4.4 Semantic types of discourse relations Different from the PDTB X  X  three-level sense hierarchy described in Sect. 6 ,we have adopted a flat, 11-valued classification scheme. A flatter sense structure is a direct consequence of defining the arguments semantically. For example, in the PDTB sense hierarchy,  X  X  X eason X  X  and  X  X  X esult X  X  are subtypes under type CONTIN-GENCY:Cause:  X  X  X eason X  X  applies to connectives like  X  X  X ecause X  X  and  X  X  X ince X  X  while distinction is syntactic in nature and encodes the order of the two arguments. Since we define the argument labels semantically, this information is now manifested in the argument labels (i.e., ARG1 and ARG2 . There is no longer any need for further division under CONTINGENCY:Cause since both types of connectives express the same underlying discourse relation when we move to annotating senses of discourse relations instead of specific discourse connectives.

Merging the subtypes in the PDTB sense hierarchy does not in itself lead to a completely flat structure, and there is another consideration for the decision to make the sense structure absolutely flat. The PDTB allows annotators to use the higher-level label when a finer distinction cannot be made. For example, in the PDTB sense hierarchy,  X  X  X ause X  X  and  X  X  X ondition X  X  are two types under the class CONTINGENCY, so if the annotator cannot decide between  X  X  X ause X  X  and  X  X  X ondition X  X , they can go up one level and use the class label  X  X  X ONTIN-GENCY X  X . Although this allowance is very reasonable, it increases the number of choices that an annotator has to make in practice: not just the choice between the two types, but also the choice between the two levels. For example, when faced with the uncertainty between  X  X  X ause X  X  and  X  X  X ondition X  X , the annotator now has three options:  X  X  X ause X  X ,  X  X  X ondition X  X  and  X  X  X ONTINGENCY X  X . By eliminating the higher-level CONTINGENCY, the choice is between  X  X  X ause X  X  and  X  X  X onditional X  X , which is a truthful reflection of the choice the annotator faces.

In addition to making the sense structure flat, we have also adjusted the sense type inventory based on the Chinese data. On the one hand, we consolidated some of the fine distinctions made in the PDTB, for example,  X  X  X ause X  X  is merged with  X  X  X ragmatic Cause X  X .  X  X  X ist X  X  is folded into  X  X  X onjunction X  X . These merges were effected when two fine distinctions were often hard to make in annotation, and there was a substantial degree of confusion between them in the preliminary annotation results. On the other hand, we have also added some new semantic types. For example, we have added  X  X  X rogression X  X  and  X  X  X urpose X  X . These are highly motivated in Chinese. This adjustment gave rise to eleven semantic types in the inventory for Chinese.

These eleven semantic types, in practice, are each associated with a prototypical discourse connective, with ARG1 and ARG2 properly positioned. For example,  X  X  X ausation X  X  is associated with ( X  X  X ecause X  X ) [ARG1] to the annotator along with the semantic type label for two purposes: (1) to concretely show the semantic definition of the two argument labels for each semantic type; (2) to help annotators reason about implicit discourse relations. Given that implicit discourse relations are overwhelmingly abundant in Chinese, it is necessary to provide a prototypical connective to help the annotator think about the sense of the relation. This practice is made easier by a flat structure in the organization of the senses. If the senses are hierarchically organized, each semantic type at the upper level of the hierarchy would be associated with multiple discourse connectives, and it would probably provide more confusion than aid.

Below we define the set of eleven semantic types along with their associated prototypical connectives, each illustrated with an example.
Alternative : Relation between two alternatives. Prototypical connective: (17) Causation : Relation between cause and effect. Prototypical connective: (18) Conditional : relation between a supposed condition and a supposed result. Prototypical connective: ( X  X  X f X  X ) [ ARG1 ] ( X  X  X hen X  X ) [ ARG2 ]. (19) Conjunction : Relation between two equal-status statements serving a common sense. Prototypical connective: [ ARG1 ] ( X  X  X nd X  X ) [ ARG2 ].
 (20) Contrast : Relation between two statements, co-occurrence of which seems contradictory, counter-intuitive, out-of-ordinary, etc. Prototypical connective: ( X  X  X lthough X  X ) [ ARG1 ] ( X  X  X ut X  X ) [ ARG2 ]. (21) Expansion : relation in which one argument is an elaboration or restatement of another. Prototypical connective: [ ARG1 ] ( X  X  X or example X  X ) [ ARG2 ]. (22) Purpose : Relation between an action and the intention behind it. Prototypical connective: ( X  X  X hrough X  X ) [ ARG1 ] ( X  X  X n order to X  X ) [ ARG2 ]. (23) Temporal : Relation that is temporal in nature, expressing temporal precedence, etc. Prototypical connectives: [ ARG1 ] ( X  X  X t X  X ) [ ARG2 ] ( X  X  X efore X  X ), [ ARG2 ] ( X  X  X t X  X ) [ ARG1 ] . In a synchronous relation, as in the case in (24), ARG1 and ARG2 are defined in text order.
 (24) Progression : Relation in which one argument represents a progression from the other, in extent, intensity, scale, etc. Prototypical connective: ( X  X  X ot only X  X ) [ ARG1 ] ( X  X  X ut also X  X ) [ ARG2 ]. (25) EntRel : Relation between two statements that are connected only by the fact that they are about the same entity or entities. (26) NoRel : No relation can be inferred between two adjacent discourse units. (27) When no obvious relation can be inferred between two adjacent sentences, as is the case in Example (27), it is often the case that the second argument is related in some way to text beyond the immediate previous sentence. Due to the limitation of resources, we currently do not look beyond the immediate previous sentence unless it is at least part of the argument to the discourse relation in question. 5 Corpus statistics and annotation evaluation 5.1 Corpus statistics We have completed the annotation of the discourse relations in 164 documents (about 70K words) 3 selected from the Chinese TreeBank (Xue et al. 2005 ). The Chinese TreeBank Project was first initiated at the University of Pennsylvania in 1998, and later moved to the University of Colorado at Boulder. It is currently under expansion at Brandeis University. As of this writing, eight versions of the Chinese TreeBank corpus have been released from the Linguistic Data Consortium, and the latest version, the Chinese TreeBank 8.0, consists of Xinhua newswire, Hong Kong news articles, Sinorama news magazine articles, broadcast news, broadcast conversations from various news outlets, weblogs and discussion forums. It has 1.6 million words, which have all been segmented into word tokens, tagged with part-of-speech (POS) information and Penn TreeBank-style constituent structures. The entire Chinese TreeBank has also been annotated with semantic roles as part of the Chinese Proposition Bank Project (Xue and Palmer 2009 ). The discourse annotation we describe in this article can be viewed as an additional layer of annotation to the Chinese TreeBank corpus. As such, all the discourse information, such as the text spans of the connectives and their arguments, are indexed to the word tokens in the underlying corpus. This way, the discourse connectives can be easily identified by their POS tag, and the arguments correspond to clauses and sentences in the Chinese TreeBank.
 The 164 documents we selected are from the Xinhua Newswire portion of the Chinese TreeBank, which was the first data genre annotated in the Chinese TreeBank Project. There are 256 total explicit connectives, and 132 of them are paired. As we have described in Sect. 3 , they are realized as subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, discourse adverbials, and localizers, each of which corresponds to a POS tag. Determining whether a connective is single or paired can sometimes be tricky, as a single connective can also be viewed as paired connective with one part of the connective missing but still expressing the same discourse relation. For example, the paired connective one connective that has different variations. For accounting purposes here, they are computed as separate discourse connective types, but they are obviously related.

Table 1 shows the distribution of discourse relations. 5,534 discourse relations are annotated, and 75.8 % of the discourse relations are implicit. Only 22.1 % of the discourse relations have explicit discourse connectives. The remaining 2.1 % are alternatively lexicalized, meaning that they are realized with expressions that are not canonical discourse connectives.

Table 2 shows the distribution of discourse relations by their sense and connective type.  X  X  X onjunction X  X  is by far the most frequent sense, with 3,418 discourse relation bearing this sense, followed by  X  X  X xpansion X  X , which has 895 instances. There are relatively fewer other types of discourse relations. We suspect that genre plays a role in the distribution of the semantic types. An  X  X  X xpansion X  X  relation generally consists of a general or conclusive statement followed or preceded by some examples or explantations. This is very typical of the kind of articles we have annotated. We suspect that the distribution could be quite different for another genre. It is also interesting to see that discourse relations of different senses have different tendencies of being realized as explicit or implicit discourse relations. While  X  X  X lternative X  X ,  X  X  X onditional X  X ,  X  X  X ontrast X  X ,  X  X  X rogression X  X ,  X  X  X urpose X  X ,  X  X  X emporal X  X  relations are more often associated with an explicit connective than not,  X  X  X onjunction X  X  and  X  X  X xpansion X  X  relations are overwhelmingly implicit. These statistics can be taken advantage of in an automatic relation sense determination task.

As we discussed in Sect. 1 , in the PDTB annotation framework, each discourse relation is annotated independently without attempting to consider the high-level global discourse structure, one discourse relation can still be connected to another as a consequence of selecting the text spans for the arguments of a discourse connective, implicit or explicit. For example, the text span of one discourse relation may be embedded in the arguments of another discourse relation. There can also be partial overlaps between the text spans of different discourse relations. Based on our calculation, out of the 5,534 total discourse relations we annotated, 4,995 of them are properly embedded in another relation, and 2,937 relations have another discourse relations embedded in them. Note these two numbers are not equal because some discourse relations may embed more than one discourse relation. 3,273 of all discourse relations partially overlap with another. The example below illustrates how one discourse relation can be connected to another: (28) a. There are three discourse relations relating four discourse segments in (28), and their relationships are illustrated in Fig. 1 . Relation  X  X  X onn2 X  X  is embedded in both Relations  X  X  X onn1 X  X  and  X  X  X onn3 X  X  because the relation as a whole is Arg1 for  X  X  X onn1 X  X  and Arg2 for  X  X  X onn2 X  X . This also means that  X  X  X onn1 X  X  and  X  X  X onn3 X  X  partially overlap with each other because they share one argument. 5.2 Annotation evaluation Our annotation procedure is one of double-blind annotation and adjudication. That is, a document is first double-annotated by two annotators who do not look at each other X  X  annotation. When the document is done, it is checked by the adjudicator, a third more experienced annotator who reconciles the differences if there are any. The annotation is performed using the PDTB annotation tool. 4 All of the 164 documents are double annotated and adjudicated, so we can compute agreement statistics for purposes of annotation evaluation.

As we have discussed in Sect. 4 , we annotate explicit and implicit relations in one pass rather than separately in two passes. Potential discourse relations are identified by examining the punctuation marks in the text. There are a number of decisions that the annotator has to make at each punctuation instance. 5 The first one is to determine whether a discourse relation exists (a step we call  X  X  X elation identification X  X ). Once a discourse relation is identified, the annotator needs to classify the type as one of  X  X  X xplicit X  X ,  X  X  X mplicit X  X , or  X  X  X ltLex X  X  (a step we call  X  X  X elation type classification X  X ). As should be clear from Table 3 , these two steps can be performed with high inter-annotator consistency with an agreement of 94.8 and 95.2 % respectively.

Another decision that the annotator has to make is the semantic type or the  X  X  X ense X  X  of the discourse relation. As we have discussed in Sect. 4 , in the case of implicit discourse relations, we bypass the step of inserting a connective and classify the semantic type directly. To help annotators think about semantic type, we associate each semantic type with a prototypical discourse connective e.g.,  X  X  X ausation: ARG2 X  X  ( X  X  X ausation: because ARG1 therefore ARG2 X  X ). This approach works well, as evidenced by 84.5 % agreement. 6 The top 10 sense pairs that are easiest to confuse with one another are presented in Table 4 . From the table, we can see that  X  X  X onjunction X  X  is the most frequent sense and it is also the one that is the easiest to confuse with other senses.

We calculate two measures for the agreement on argument spans and both measures group explicit and implicit discourse relations together. The first measure is based on exact match, where each argument span is treated as a separate token, and there is a match only if both boundaries of the argument match. The agreement is computed as the number of matched argument spans between the two annotators divided by the total number of discourse relations both annotators picked. By this measure, the accuracy is 77.1 %. The second measure treats each argument boundary as a separate token, so represents a partial span match. Typically, an argument span has two boundaries, but it can have four (or more) boundaries when an argument span is discontinuous and interrupted by a connective and/or an AltLex item. This metric is less stringent than exact match but more stringent than the partial match used by the PDTB (Miltsakaki et al. 2004 ) where as long as one boundary matches it counts as a match for the argument. We computed the precision, recall and F1-score for this measure. The precision is the number of matched argument boundaries divided by the total number of boundaries proposed by one annotator and the recall is the number of matched argument boundaries divided by the total number of boundaries proposed by the other annotator. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. By this metric, the precision is 0.88, the recall is 0.883, and the F1-measure is 0.881. The argument span agreement statistics show that determining the boundaries of an argument is a challenging aspect of discourse annotation. (29) is an example where two annotators agree on the span of ARG1 but not ARG2. This is a  X  X  X onjunction X  X  relation anchored by a comma, and one annotator includes an extra clause as part of ARG2. The correct annotation is to exclude it from ARG2. This type of annotation decisions are similar to the attachment decisions in the annotation of the syntactic structure of a sentence and it is an area where disagreements are more likely to occur. (29) 6 Related work There now exist a range of different discourse annotation frameworks for natural language text, reflecting different conceptions of the discourse structure of a text. The RST Discourse TreeBank (Carlson et al. 2003 ), based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson 1988 ), is committed to recursively building a tree structure for the discourse, using non-overlapping contiguous text spans called EDUs as basic building blocks. Both the Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) (Asher and Lascarides 2003 ) and the Discourse Graph Bank (Wolf and Gibson 2005 ) view the discourse structure of a text as a directed graph where nodes are discourse segments or groups of discourse segments, and labeled directed arcs represent coherence relations. The use of a graph as a representation device opens the door for long-distance attachments as well as crossed dependencies, and this is a property shared by both SDRT and the Graph Discourse Bank annotation framework, but the former is constrained by the right frontier principle which postulates that each new EDU is attached either to the last discourse unit or to one that is superordinate to it. Annotating the discourse structure of an entire text as a single tree or graph is a complex task. It is perhaps no co-incidence that existing discourse-annotated corpora are generally small, with perhaps the exception of the PDTB. As we discussed in Sect. 1 , we adopted the PDTB annotation framework because it annotates independent discourse relations and does not a priori assume a single connected structure for the entire text, thus reducing the cognitive load on the annotators and potentially increasing annotation speed and making it feasible for large-scale annotation. Essentially we trade off some representation expressiveness for annotation practicality.

The development of the PDTB has spawned a number of discourse annotation projects in other languages. These annotation projects are at different stages of development but they all share the same basic conception that a discourse relation is composed of a discourse connective taking two abstract objects as their arguments and treat each discourse relation independently without committing to a high-level global structure. At the same time, they all made adaptations to the PDTB annotation framework to make it better fit the language that is annotated. These adaptations fall within two main areas. The first one is what constitutes a discourse connective and what can be arguments for these discourse connectives for that language. For the Leeds Arabic Discourse TreeBank (LADT) (Al-Saif and Markert 2010 ), for example, discourse connectives include prepositions and clitics due to the rich morphology of the language. In addition to clauses and sentences, potential arguments also include  X  X  X oun sentences X  X , which is equivalent to an English clause or phrase. Similarly, the Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB) (Zeyrek and Webber 2008 ; Zeyrek et al. 2009 , 2010 ), which has not yet annotated implicit discourse relations, annotates nominal arguments for subordinators which always have at least one nominal argument as well as other discourse connectives that have nominal arguments. In addition to subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, and discourse adverbials, the Hindi Discourse Relation Bank (HDRB) (Oza et al. 2009 ) also recognizes sentential relatives (relative pronouns that conjoin a relative clause and its matrix clause), subordinators (postpositions, verbal particles, and suffixes that introduce non-finite clauses with an abstract object interpretation), and described work on adding a discourse layer of annotation to the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajic  X  et al. 2003 ) centered on discourse connectives, which like English include conjunctions, subordinations, adverbs as well as some particles. The second area of adaptation is regarding the taxonomy of discourse relations. For example, like the CDTB, the HDRB also defines the arguments based on their semantics and eliminates the argument-specific labels in the discourse relations. In addition, it replaces the PDTB pragmatic senses with a uniform three-way classification. Each pragmatic sense at the type level is further distinguished into three subtypes:  X  X  X pistemic X  X ,  X  X  X peech act X  X , and  X  X  X ropositional X  X . In addition, it also adds a  X  X  X oal X  X  sense under  X  X  X ontinguency X  X . The LADT reduces the number of types to 18, and adds two other types: Expansion.Background and Comparision.Similarity. Mladova  X  of the PDTB in the discourse layer annotation for the Prague Dependency TreeBank by introducing new relations such as  X  X  X urpose X  X  and  X  X  X radation X  X .

Discourse-related annotation is still relatively rare for Chinese. The CJPL Project is based on the the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) and considers non-overlapping consecutive text spans as the basic units of discourse relations (EDUs). The CLPJ corpus consists of 97 texts from a Chinese news commentary corpus. One important difference between the CDTB annotation scheme and the CJPL annotation scheme, other than the fact that the CDTB is adapted from the PDTB annotation scheme and the CJPL corpus is based on RST, is that in the CJPL corpus, the EDUs are identified by punctuation marks such as periods, question marks, explanations, colons and semi-colons, as well as paragraph boundaries to the exclusion of commas because, as we have discussed in Sect. 3.2 , commas are ambiguous and they do not always signal the boundary of discourse units. We chose to use commas as signals for argument boundaries by disambiguating them as we believe this adds value to the annotated corpus. After all, one of the most important reasons for performing annotation is to disambiguate based on the context. Huang and Chen ( 2011 , 2012a , b ) describe pilot efforts to perform PDTB-style annotation on data selected from the Sinica TreeBank (Chen et al. 2004 ). The initial annotation (Huang and Chen 2011 ) was focused on just inter-sentential discourse relations using the upper-level relations from the PDTB taxonomy. That was later extended to intra-sentential relations (Huang and Chen 2012b ), and sentiment polarity was also added as part of the annotation (Huang and Chen 2012a ). It is not clear to us, however, whether implicit relations were annotated and whether comma was disambiguated in their annotation effort. 7 Conclusions We presented the Chinese Discourse TreeBank, a corpus annotated with PDTB-style discourse relations that take the form of a predicate with two arguments. Based on the syntactic and statistic distributions of Chinese discourse connectives as well as the distribution of punctuation marks, we made a few significant adaptations to the PDTB annotation approach. These include designing an annotation procedure where we annotate explicit and implicit discourse relations in one pass, defining the arguments based on semantic rather than syntactic grounds or textual order, and annotating the semantic type or sense of implicit discourse relations without first inserting an explicit discourse connective. We annotated a significant amount of data (164 texts, around 70 thousand words) selected from the Chinese TreeBank, and provided agreement statistics that demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.
