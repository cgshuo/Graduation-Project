 Collaborative tagging has become an increasingly popular means for sharing and organizing Web resources, leading to a huge amount of user generated metadata. These tags represent quite a few dif-ferent aspects of the resources they describe and it is not obvious whether and how these tags or subsets of them can be used for search. This paper is the first to present an in-depth study of tag-ging behavior for very different kinds of resources and systems  X  Web pages ( Del.icio.us ), music ( Last.fm ), and images ( Flickr )  X  and compares the results with anchor text characteristics. We an-alyze and classify sample tags from these systems, to get an in-sight into what kinds of tags are used for different resources, and provide statistics on tag distributions in all three tagging environ-ments. Since even relevant tags may not add new information to the search procedure, we also check overlap of tags with content, with metadata assigned by experts and from other sources. We discuss the potential of different kinds of tags for improving search, com-paring them with user queries posted to search engines as well as through a user survey. The results are promising and provide more insight into both the use of different kinds of tags for improving search and possible extensions of tagging systems to support the creation of potentially search-relevant tags.

Web 2.0 tools and environments have made collaborative tagging very popular  X  any user can assign freely selectable words, in the form of keywords or category labels, to shared content to describe and organize these resources. Several of these tagging systems have been acquired by search engine companies  X  Flickr and Del.icio.us by Yahoo!, YouTube by Google  X  which now also extend search to these communities.

One of the earliest Web 2.0 applications, Flickr , is currently the most popular photo sharing website and online community plat-form. Flickr asks photo submitters to describe images using tags, to allow searchers to (re-)find pictures using place name, subject mat-ter, or other aspects of the picture. For the music domain, Last.fm is the world X  X  largest social music platform, with over 20 million active users based in more than 230 countries. Since August 2005, Last.fm supports tagging of artists, albums, and tracks to create a site-wide folksonomy of music. Tags can describe genre ( X  X arage rock X ), mood ( X  X hill X ), artist characteristic ( X  X aritone X ), or any other form of user-defined classification ( X  X een live X ). Del.icio.us is the premiere social bookmarking Web site for storing, sharing, and discovering Web bookmarks, where users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely chosen keywords. A combined view of ev-eryone X  X  bookmarks with a given tag is available and users can view bookmarks added by similar-minded users.

However, users X  motivations for tagging resources, as well as the types of assigned tags differ across systems, and their potential to improve search remains unclear, despite initial investigations. First studies have started to investigate tagging motivations and patterns, usually for one specific collection, including some initial work on how to support the tagging process and improve information re-trieval algorithms in general using tags. There are no studies so far investigating these questions across different collections, and there is only limited research regarding the usefulness of tags for search. Do tags provide new information about the content they annotate, or do they just replicate what is already available from content or other metadata? What kinds of tags are used, and which types can improve search most? These are some of the questions we inves-tigate in this paper by analyzing tag data from three very different tagging systems: Del.icio.us , Flickr and Last.fm , as well as anchor texts from a Stanford Web crawl. Results are promising and pro-vide interesting insights into the use of different kinds of tags for improving search.

The paper is structured as follows: After a discussion of relevant previous work in Section 2, Section 3 provides a description of the datasets which we use in our investigation. Section 4 focuses on tag analysis and tagging behavior, to provide more information about the types of tags that are used in several tagging environments. We provide information on the distribution of different types of tags in different collections. We investigate  X  by comparison with ex-pert created metadata  X  the reliability of these annotations and their information gain over already existing content. Based on these re-sults, Section 5 then explores the potential of tags to answer queries and improve search, using both user queries from a search engine log as well as user studies focusing on perceived usefulness of dif-ferent types of tags in searching as well as users X  ability to remem-ber tags. Finally, in Section 6 we conclude and present ideas for future work.
While tagging behavior has been studied in previous work, these studies either focus only on one specific collaborative tagging sys-tem [8, 9, 19, 1, 10] or only provide first qualitative insights across collections from very small samples [15, 22]. The next paragraphs give a short overview over existing work, from which we started our investigations.

Tagging Motivations. First analyses of tagging systems show that reasons for tagging are quite manifold and with them the kinds of tags used. Marlow et al. [15] identifies organizational motiva-tions for tagging, other more social tagging motivations include opinion expression, the attraction of attention, and self-presentation [8, 15] or providing context to friends [1]. The predominant mo-tivation seems to vary depending on tagging rights, tagging sup-port, aggregation model, object type, source of material, resource connectivity and social connectivity  X  all influencing why certain tags are used or not [15]. According to [22], in free-for-all sys-tems opinion expression, self-presentation, activism and perfor-mance tags become more frequent, while in self-tagging systems like Flickr or Del.icio.us users tag almost exclusively for their own benefit of enhanced information organization [8]. Still, stable struc-tures do emerge in collaborative tagging systems [8, 9, 11]. Like for other complex systems the evolving pattern follows a scale-free power law distribution, indicating convergence of the used vocabu-lary coexisting with a long tail of highly idiosyncratic terms [9, 11]. Sen et al. [19] showed in an experiment on vocabulary formation in the MovieLens system how different design choices affect the nature/types of tags used, their distributions and the convergence within a group  X  an assumption made by Marlow et al. [15] when introducing a general taxonomy of tagging systems.

This paper investigates these issues for and across several large collections in more detail, comparing and discussing their common characteristics as well as their differences, plus the implications of tagging behavior in different collections on search.

Tags Supporting Search. Based on the idea that tags in book-marking systems usually provide good summaries of Web pages and that they indicate the popularity of a page, [2] investigated the use of tags for improving Web search. The proposed SocialSimi-larityRank measures the association between tags and SocialPage-Rank accounts for the popularity among taggers in terms of a fre-quency ranking. In [11] the authors suggest an adapted PageRank-like algorithm, FolkRank, to improve efficient searching via per-sonalized and topic-specific ranking within the tag space. This can be used to recommend interesting users, resources and related tags to increase the chance of  X  X erendipitous encounters X . In music re-trieval, tags can be used as an alternative or additional possibility to find songs: In [7] Last.fm songs are not only recommended based on track-lists (song and artist) of similar users, but also by con-sidering (descriptive) tags. Their experimental results showed that tag-based search algorithms provide better and faster recommenda-tion results than traditional track-based collaborative filtering meth-ods. In [10], the authors try to answer the question whether social bookmarking data can be used to augment Web search. Their anal-ysis of a Del.icio.us dataset shows that tags tend to gravitate toward certain domains and that tags occur in over 50% of pages they an-notate. Only in 20% tags do not occur in page text, back-link text, or forward-link page text of the pages they annotate. We extend these results, by investigating in detail several different datasets containing tagged data, covering pictures ( Flickr ), music ( Last.fm ) and bookmarks ( Del.icio.us ), and by investigating the potential of different kinds of tags for improving search.

Anchor Text Used for Search. Anchor text ( AT ) or link label is the visible, clickable text in a hyperlink. AT are broadly and suc-cessfully used in Web search engines [3]; the idea of attaching AT to the linked object dates back to the first Web search engines [16] in 1994. Because AT accurately describe the content of a linked ob-ject [5, 3], they can also be used for computing similarity between objects and in particular Web pages [12, 20] or for query refine-ment [14]. Given that anchor text has been investigated in detail, we compare our results on tags characteristics with those of AT .
In the following we present the datasets we used for our studies, the methods used for gathering the data and some basic statistics on tag distributions.
Last.fm . For our analysis, we have crawled an extensive subset of the Last.fm website in May 2007, focusing on pages correspond-ing to tags, music tracks and user profiles. We obtained informa-tion about a total number of 317,058 tracks and their associated attributes, including track and artist name, other metadata as well as tags for these tracks plus their corresponding usage frequencies. Starting from the most popular tags, we found a number of 21,177 different tags, which are used on Last.fm for tagging tracks, artists or albums. For each of these tags we extracted the number of times each tag has been used, number of users which used the tag, as well as lists of similar tags together with their similarity scores.
Flickr . For comparison with Flickr characteristics, we took ad-vantage of data crawled by our research partners during January 2004 and December 2005. The crawling was done by starting with some initial tags from the most popular ones and then expanding the crawl based on these tags. We used a small portion of the first 100,000 pictures crawled, associated with 32,378 unique tags as-signed with different frequencies.

Del.icio.us . The Del.icio.us data for our analysis was kindly pro-vided by research partners as well. This data was collected during July 27 and July 30, 2005 by gathering a first set of nearly 6,900 users and 700 tags from the start page of Del.icio.us . These were used to download more data in a recursive manner. Additional users and resources were collected by monitoring the Del.icio.us start page. A list of several thousand usernames was collected and used for accessing the first 10,000 resources each user had tagged. From the collected data we extracted resources, tags, dates, descriptions, usernames, etc. The resulting collection comprises 323,294 unique tags associated to 2,507,688 bookmarks.

Web Anchor Texts . Although the text in HTML anchors ( &lt;a&gt; ) is not part of an explicit collaborative tagging system, it represents a similar annotation mechanism. Since most web search engines already use AT to improve results, we compare it with the collabo-rative tagging systems investigated in this paper. Our dataset con-sisted of 8,453,043 Web pages parsed from a Stanford WebBase crawl of the Web from January 2006. We extracted 10,348,807 dif-
WebBase crawls available at http://www-diglib. stanford.edu/~testbed/doc2/WebBase/ ferent AT ignoring case. 7,902,047 AT were links to a page in the same domain ( internal ), while 2,756,377 were links to pages in dif-ferent domains ( external ). Interestingly, only a very small portion, 3%, of all AT , were used for both internal and external links. Figure 1: Frequency distribution log scale plot comparing tag-ging systems and anchor text usages
Figure 1 presents a comparison of the collaborative tagging sys-tems we analyzed. Usage of tags basically follows a power law distribution for each system. We observe a sharp drop at the end for the Flickr and Last.fm curves, due to the crawling mechanism which focused more on popular tags.

Disregarding the exact number of tags (this was dependent on each system X  X  architecture and the crawling methods), we analyzed the slopes of the different systems. A more abrupt slope shows that popular tags are being used more often while tags in the tail have less weight. A more gradual inclination indicates a more even use of tags throughout the collection. The most evenly distributed system is Flickr where people almost always tag only their own pictures, not much influenced by others. For Del.icio.us , influence of others is more visible as the slope gets steeper. Last.fm shows the steepest slope, with a few very popular tags and 60% of the top 100 representing genre information. Last.fm covers a very specific domain  X  music  X  which explains why tags are more restricted than in Flickr where images can include everything and in Del.icio.us which has an even broader range of topics (in the ODP 2 catalog, about 4 million Web sites are filed into more than 590,000 different categories).

The AT distribution plot shows two visibly different parts with different slopes. The head (top 750 external AT ; top 2,000 internal AT ) is more even than for all three collaborative tagging systems, while the tail for the external AT is comparable to Del.icio.us tags, and for external AT is not a perfect power law distribution. We think this is mainly due to the fact that in our analyzed sample these top AT point to a small set of very popular Web pages. These are external AT sites like search engines, important news sites and portals, as well as internal AT links to key pages for the Web site like table of contents, site map and home pages. As Figure 1 shows, all our datasets exhibit power law characteristics, so that even if the sizes of the collections differ, results are still consistent and comparable.

The following section presents and discusses the results of our comparative investigations of tag usage in Last.fm , Del.icio.us , Flickr , and in AT , providing answers to relevant questions and as-pects. Looking at the usage of different types of tags, we first iden-tify and quantify the distinctions occurring in users X  tagging behav-ior. Most of the tags are potentially useful for search, though not all kinds of tags are equally valuable. We further investigate reliability of tags and added value, comparing how well tags correspond to metadata assigned by experts as well as looking into the amount of new, non-redundant information provided by tags.
Tags serve various functions based on system features like re-source type, tagging rights, etc. [15], and not all these tags are equally useful for the community or for interpersonal retrieval [8]. For being able to improve tag based search, we first need to know how tags are used and which types of annotations we can expect to find along with resources. For this purpose, we propose and use an extended tag taxonomy appropriate for different tagging systems. This builds on and extends previous work, which has discussed classification schemes for tags, restricted however to only a single tagging system or based on very small data samples. We then in-vestigate tag distributions in different collections, based on our tag classification scheme, and also provide measures on the accuracy of our taxonomy.
We started with an exploratory analysis of existing taxonomies (see [8, 19, 21]), as well as possible attribute fields for the differ-ent resources to be considered. As a resource can be characterized by different attributes, tag types shed light on what distinctions are important to taggers [8]. We kept and refined the most fine-grained scheme presented by Golder &amp; Huberman [8], adding the classes Time and Location , in order to make it applicable to systems other than Del.icio.us , which only focuses on Web page annotation. We went through several iterations to improve the scheme by classify-ing sample tags and testing for agreement between multiple raters as described in Section 4.1.3. Our final taxonomy comprises eight classes, presented together with example tags from our datasets in Table 1. Table 2 presents an approximate mapping between our taxonomy and other existing tag classification schemes.

Topic is probably the most obvious way to describe an arbitrary resource, describing what a tagged item is about. For music, Topic was defined to include theme (e.g.  X  X ove X ), title and lyrics. The Topic of a picture refers to any object or person displayed. While such Topic information can partially be extracted from the content of textual resources [10], it is not easily accessible for pictures or music. Tags in the Time category add contextual information about month, year, season, or other time related modifiers. This includes the time a picture was taken, a music piece or Web page was pro-duced. Similarly, Location is an additional retrieval cue, providing information about sights, country or town, or the origin of a mu-sician. Tags may also specify the Type , which mainly corresponds to file, media or Web page type ( X  X df X ,  X  X log X , etc.). In music this category comprises tags specifying format as well as instrumen-tation and music genre. For pictures, this includes camera settings and photographic styles like  X  X ortrait X  or  X  X acro X . Yet another way to organize resources is by identifying the Author/Owner who cre-ated the resource (author, artist) or owns it (a music and entertain-ment group like Sony BMG or a Flickr user). Tags can also com-ment subjectively on the quality of a resource, expressing opinions based on social motivations typical for free-for-all-tagging systems, or are simply used as rating-like annotations for easing personal re-trieval. Usage context tags suggest what to use a resource for, or the context/task the resource was collected in and grouped by. These tags ( e.g.  X  X obsearch X ,  X  X orProgramming X , etc.), although subjec-tive, may still be a good basis for recommendations to other users. Last, Self reference contains highly personal tags, mostly helpful for the tagger herself. For comparison, we applied this tag classi-fication scheme also to our AT collection  X  defining Self reference in terms of site internal and system-reference comprising frequent navigational AT pointing to pages within the domain or sections of a Web page.
To make manual tag classification feasible we had to sample our data  X  we manually investigated 1200 tags in total. For the three different tagging systems as well as for our AT collection, we took three samples of 100 tags each to be manually classified. These three samples per system included the top 100 tags, 100 tags starting from 70% of probability density (based on absolute occur-rences), and 100 tags beginning from 90%. These different sam-ples based on rank percentages were chosen based on the results of prior work [9] which suggested that different parts of the power law curve exhibit distinct patterns. Our goal was to provide descriptive statistics about tag type usage depending on popularity to formulate appropriate hypotheses based on relative frequencies of distinct tag types. Some samples range over slightly more than 100 tags, as some tags had to be skipped as they were completely unreadable or not understandable. Also, since our data sets have different sizes, the long tail is cut off at different points, which may lead to slight shifts in ranks. However, as the long tail consists mostly of id-iosyncratic tags with very low usage frequencies, the influence of this adjustment should be negligible.
 We classified the different types of tags across different systems. The resulting distributions are shown in the Figure 2. The most obvious general conclusion is that tag types are very different for different collections. Specifically, the most important category for Del.icio.us and Flickr is Topic , while for Last.fm , the Type category is the most prominent one, due to the abundance of genre tags, which fall into this class. Obviously, genre is the easiest way of characterizing and organizing music  X  one of the rare exceptions was for the theme  X  X ove X  and some parts of the lyrics/title. In con-trast, a similar dominance can be observed for Topic in case of Web resources and pictures. Type is also common in Del.icio.us , as it specifies whether a page contains certain media. As Flickr is used only for pictures, Type variations only include fine grained distinc-tions like  X  X acro X   X  most users do not seem to make such pro-fessional annotations. For pictures only, Location plays an impor-tant role. Usage context seems to be more used in Del.icio.us and Flickr , while Last.fm as a free-for-all-tagging system (with lower motivation for organization) exhibits a significantly higher amount of subjective/opinion tags. Time and Self reference only represent a very small part of the tags studied here. Author/Owner is a little more frequent, though very rarely used in Flickr due to the fact that people mainly tag their own pictures [15]. For AT , specifying the Topic is the main functional category. External AT are mostly titles of pages or very similar to titles. Self (or system) reference is the second most important function for AT ; AT for internal site naviga-tion falls into this category. Time , Location and Opinions/Qualities are rare for AT .

To better understand how importance of tag categories varies with tag popularity, Figure 3 shows the distributions for all systems across all samples. Again, we observe Type as the predominant tag category for music, while for URLs and pictures it is Topic  X  mostly increasing across samples. For the long tail of the Last.fm sample, usage of Type category decreases, and opinion expression and artist labeling ( Author/Owner ) get more important. For AT , internal Self or system reference decreases in importance for less frequent AT . This is probably related to the fact that the vocabulary for many navigational AT is highly standardized ( X  X ome X ,  X  X op X ) and so highly ranked. The same argument holds for types of linked resources.

The type distribution between systems shows a clear tendency of preferred tag functions that do not depend much on the popu-larity of the tags. With respect to search, it is encouraging to see,
Figure 3: Tag type distributions across systems and samples that most tags  X  Topics and resource Type in general, Topic and Location for pictures, and to a certain degree Type for music  X  are factual in nature, verifiable and thus potentially relevant to the com-munity and other users. Subjective and personal tags (categories 6, 8) are only a minor part (except for category 8 in AT ). Similar to re-sults reported in [22], Opinions/Qualities are only characteristic for social, free-for-all music tagging systems (like Last.fm ), possibly because for young people (exposing) music taste is one important aspect in forming one X  X  own personal identity.
Clearly, such classification schemes only represent one possi-ble way of categorizing things. Quite a few tags are ambiguous due to homonymy (especially for Flickr and Del.icio.us , e.g.  X  X p-ple X ,  X  X hannon X ) and therefore it is difficult to decide in which of the categories they would fit best. We based our decision on the most popular resource(s) tagged. In general, it was often necessary to check co-occurring tags and associated resources to clarify tag meaning, especially for the very technical Del.icio.us bookmarks. During classification we even found some tags considered as  X  X ac-tual X  difficult to classify directly. For example,  X  X acation X  can be considered as the Topic of a Web resource, as well as a personal tag of type Usage context grouping resources for the next holidays. Similarly  X  X oo X  or  X  X estival X  may be depicted in a picture or used as context attributes not directly inferable from the resource. De-pending on the intended usage such tags fit into more than one cat-egory. This problem of concise category boundaries also applies to the other categorization schemes presented in section 4.1.1. Again, our classification decisions were based on popularity of associated resources.

These observations prompt the interesting questions of how much accuracy, i.e. consistency, can be obtained for such a tag clas-sification scheme. Hence, we evaluated inter-rater agreement, to get a quantitative measure on possible accuracy. From our initial sample we selected 75 tags per system (25 randomly chosen tags per range) plus 75 per anchor tags and had them also assessed by students unfamiliar with the tag categorization scheme. We com-puted Cohen X  X  Kappa (  X  ) [4] which indicates the achieved inter-rater agreement beyond-chance, as the standard measure to assess concordance for our nominal data.

Our raw agreement value for the  X  calculation is about 0.79 given the sum of 0.77 for the by chance expected frequencies, resulting in a  X  of 0.71  X  considered as good and substantial inter-rater re-liability [4]. Looking more closely at the values for the individual systems, we found the classification for Last.fm the most consis-tent with actual agreement of 0.85 and  X  value of 0.74 ( Flickr : 0.8 and 0.69; Del.icio.us : 0.67 and 0.46; AT : 0.83 and 0.7). We ob-serve that for more constrained systems concordance seems to be higher. The partial disagreement observed may be caused by ambi-guity of the classification scheme, but also because the Topic cate-gory is so prevalent: Since this category is very frequently assigned (264 out of 300 ratings) chance agreement (expected frequency) is enormously high which leads to a reduced  X  value independent of the actual agreement rate [6]. To account for the ambiguity in tag meaning and tag function for certain resources, we gave the rater a chance to name a second category that would fit as well. Tak-ing into account this second possible category for a tag, our  X  im-proved considerably to 0.80  X  0.76 for Last.fm , 0.9 for Flickr , 0.59 for Del.icio.us and 0.75 for AT respectively.

It is interesting to investigate how existing tag categorization schemes including ours can be improved further. The confusion matrix created for the  X  calculation reveals several prominent con-fusion patterns for the Del.icio.us tags  X  always involving the  X  X efault X  Topic category. Specifically, in several cases we found disagreement on whether a tag indicated the Topic or Type , Au-thor/Owner or Usage context respectively.
Given the huge amount of metadata created through collabora-tive tagging, another interesting question concerns its reliability: is it worth using tags for search, or should we use instead annota-tions produced by experts? To answer this question, we compared metadata created by experts against metadata produced by commu-nities of users. The music domain is very suitable for this kind of analysis, since there are a lot of online available music reviews for albums, tracks, and artists, produced by human experts. At the same time, on the Last.fm portal, we can find most metadata in the form of tags, assigned to the same kinds of entities (tracks, albums and artists).

Tags in music reviews. In this experiment, we analyzed the overlap between tags assigned to Last.fm tracks and music reviews extracted from Google results for the same set of tracks. From the 317,058 Last.fm tracks in our original dataset, we randomly se-lected 8,130 tracks, for which we tried to find music reviews by sending queries in the form [  X  X rtist X   X  X rack X  music review -lyrics ] to Google  X  the same query as used in [13]. For each of the selected tracks we considered the top 100 Google results, and extracted the text of the corresponding pages to create one single document in-side which we searched for the tags corresponding to the track. The tag distribution found was linear and 73.01% of the track tags occurred inside review pages. This overlap is rather high, and prob-ably caused by the fact that most of the Last.fm tags represent genre names, which also occur very often in music reviews.

Second, we investigated how many of the tags assigned to tracks occurred in the manually created reviews from www.allmusic. com . We randomly selected music tracks from our Last.fm dataset and crawled the Web pages corresponding to their AllMusic re-views. If no review was available for one track, we tried to find the review Web page of the album featuring that track. The resulting dataset consisted of 3,600 reviews. Following the same procedure as for the previous experiment, with reviews crawled from Google results, we found that 46.14% of the tags belonging to a track oc-curred on the AllMusic review pages. Again the tag distribution we found is linear. We hypothesize that the lower number of matches is due to the fact that AllMusic reviews are created by a relatively small number of human experts, which use a more homogeneous and thus restricted vocabulary than found in arbitrary reviews on the Web. A graphical representation of tag distributions for both Web and AllMusic reviews is given in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Tags Distribution in Web and AllMusic Reviews
It is also interesting to investigate the added value of tags: do they provide new information on the content they annotate, or just replicate what is already available from the content itself?
Tags and AT in Web pages. From the Del.icio.us crawl we ex-tracted 20,911 URLs for which we had the full HTML page in the WebBase crawl. For these we counted how many tags appear in the Web page text they annotate and found that this is the case for 44.85% of the selected Del.icio.us tags. This result is close to the value of 50% found in [10] and thus confirms their finding. Com-paring how many AT are present in pages they link to, we analyzed 8,614,990 AT and found that 44.7% of external AT and 81.24% of internal AT are already present in the linked page text. Results are thus similar to those of Del.icio.us tags as only external AT should be regarded as a collaborative annotation scheme comparable to Del.icio.us .
 We also computed the overlap between Bookmarks from Del.icio.us and the URLs from the Web crawl, and found 77,756 URLs present in both analyzed datasets. When manually compar-ing the tags to the AT of the corresponding pages it became obvious that most AT look like page titles, while tags relate to page content descriptions. We computed text matches between tags and AT . As Del.icio.us tags consist only of one word, we found a very low rate, of 4.71%, of the URLs that have at least one exact match between a tag and an AT , and 42.52% of the URLs that have at least one partial match, i.e., the tag was contained in the AT . For the same overlapping dataset we computed Pearson X  X  correlation coefficient between the frequency of tags and that of AT . We found that these frequencies are uncorrelated (for internal AT p = 0 . 0002 , for ex-ternal AT p = 0 . 0411 ) although there is a slight, yet insignificant, increase in correlation for external AT .

Tags in track lyrics. To get an indication of how often tags are used to describe the theme of songs, we computed the overlap between track tags and track lyrics. The dataset used in this ex-periment consisted of the intersection of our Last.fm collection and a crawl of the site www.lyricsdownload.com . The intersec-tion of the two sets consisted of 77,498 tracks, for which attributes, such as lyrics, name of the track, album featuring the track, and tags assigned by Last.fm listeners are available.

To analyze how many of the tags assigned by the users describe what the songs are about, we took all tags corresponding to the tracks and tried to find them in the track lyrics. Due to space lim-itations, we do not include the graphic depicting the distribution of the number of tags which occur in the text of the corresponding tracks X  lyrics. The curve follows a power law distribution: the max-imum number of tags which also appeared in the lyrics text was 11, which was the case for only one track; approximately 3,000 tracks had more than 1 tag occurring in the corresponding tracks X  lyrics; around 10,300 tracks had only 1 tag that could be exactly matched inside lyrics text and for the rest of about 63,000 tracks none of the tags was found in this  X  X riginal X  content. On average, 1.54% of the tracks X  tags occurred in the lyrics  X  which is in line with our manual tagging classification results (see Section 4.1.2).
The results presented in Section 4.1.2 show that the tag distri-butions depend on the resource domain: pictures and Web pages can contain objects referring to any topic, whereas music resources are very restricted in content, leading to a much more focused set of top tags. Analyzing tag types, we were able to show that more than 50% of the tags in Del.icio.us , Flickr and AT are Topic -related keywords. As non-subjective annotations, these tags are usable for search by all users, not just the tagger. A probable motivation for using these tags is that Web pages and pictures can belong to any topic category, thus classifying these resources with topics is a very natural way to organize them.

In contrast, for Last.fm the Type category is predominant: most of the tags correspond to music genres. In Last.fm we also find more opinion related tags, whose top tags might be useful for a majority of users, but not for people disagreeing with popular opin-ion. Opinion/Quality and Author/Owner are the second and third most used classes for tagging music resources.
 Regarding added informational value of tags we observe that Del.icio.us tags are, like AT , present in 45% of the pages they anno-tate. Only 43% of Del.icio.us tags are included in AT for the same URL they point to. This means that over 50% of tags bring new information to items they annotate or describe. In contrast, Last.fm tags are usually not contained at all in lyrics (the only textual orig-inal content available): the percentage of new tags is 98.5%. Re-garding music reviews (another source of information about music,
Figure 5: Distribution of query types for different resources manually created by human experts), at least one Last.fm tag occurs in the review texts for almost all analyzed tracks. This proves tags to be a reliable source of metadata about songs, created more easily by a much higher number of users.
Extending and complementing our final discussion in the previ-ous section, we also explored how users X  search and tagging behav-ior compare. We analyze how much a query log overlaps with tags and conduct a user study which shows what tag types users con-sider most useful for search and which ones they remember best -being thus easily available to be used as retrieval cues in search.
In this experiment, we investigated how much current Web queries overlap with tags. We used the AOL query logs [18] to calculate overlap between Web queries and tags, and contrasted tag and query classes.

First, we counted what percentage of queries consist of tags used in our three systems. Regarding Del.icio.us , 71.22% of queries con-tain at least one Del.icio.us tag, while 30.61% of queries consist en-tirely of Del.icio.us tags. This confirms the findings in [10] that due to the significant overlap Del.icio.us tags may help finding Web re-sources matching queries to tags. For Flickr and Last.fm the num-bers are 64.54% and 12.66%, and 58.43% and 6%, respectively. Here we have to take into account that our tag vocabulary contains 323,294 Del.icio.us tags, while we only have 32,378 Flickr tags and 21,177 Last.fm tags. Nevertheless, we notice that Del.icio.us tags (for tagging general resources) appear much more often in queries than Flickr or Last.fm tags (images or music related tags). Also, tags describing images are used almost twice as much in queries than music related tags.

For our comparative analysis of tags and queries we tried to find the tag classes established before within queries  X  investigating which kind of tags could best answer a given query. We built a frequency sorted list of all queries in the AOL log and took three samples, as in Section 4.1.2. For comparing system specific behav-ior, we similarly sampled 300 queries for music and 300 for image queries, by filtering the query log for queries containing a keyword (like  X  X usic X ,  X  X ong X ,  X  X icture X  etc.) or having a click on Last.fm or Flickr . The resulting queries were classified into our eight cate-gories, with queries belonging to multiple classes in case they con-sisted of terms corresponding to different functions. The results are shown in Figure 5. Not quite surprisingly, general Web queries often name the Topic of a resource  X  just like tags in Del.icio.us do to an even larger extent. The query distribution pattern seems to fit to tag types except for a clear difference regarding category 5 ( Author/Owner ). Usage context is more often used for tag based information organization than for search. For obvious reasons, Self reference is not a useful query type for public Web resources.
For images, our tag type distribution almost perfectly corre-sponds to the query type patterns. As figure 5 shows, Topic ac-counts for about half of the queries, as well as of the tags in Flickr . Slight differences exist for Location , used more for tagging than for searching and Author/Owner being somewhat more important for queries than for tagging. Interestingly, there seem to be many more subjective queries beside the Topic asking for Opinions/Qualities like  X  X unny X ,  X  X ublic X  or  X  X rotic X  pictures. This however may also be influenced by our samples which often contained queries for adult pictures. With decreasing popularity of tags this category becomes somewhat less important  X  with increasing emphasis on Topic and Location .

The biggest deviation between queries and tags occurs for music queries. While our tags in Last.fm are to a large extent genre names, user queries belong to the Usage context category (like  X  X edding songs X  or  X  X raduation songs X , or songs from movie or video games, category 7). Also, users search for known music by artist (cate-gory 5) and title or theme (category 1). This difference may be due to information value considerations: as artist and title are already provided in Last.fm as formal metadata there is no need to tag re-sources with this information. In the less frequent tags of Last.fm these become more important, so our sampling of popular tags for this system may underestimate their importance. Lyrics are not fre-quently searched for. An interesting and surprising observation is that searching by genre is rare: Users intensively use tags from this category, but do not use them to search for music. One reason for this might be the fact that many music pieces get tagged with the same genre and thus search results for genre queries would contain far too many hits. Categorizing tracks into genre is also subjective to a certain extent, as it depends on the annotator X  X  expertise. The amount of subjective qualities asked for or tagged is comparable for the Last.fm system, with about 16% each.

For music we did not find any structural differences across the three samples that could be generalized. We also remark that we found similar morphological variations and spelling errors in queries as in tags across all resource types.
On the Web, users X  searching behavior might be different than when searching directly inside a tagging system. We therefore also conducted a user survey on how users describe and remember re-sources, based on the methodology described in [17]. Specifically, we wanted to discover:
We had 30 participants in our user study: all of them are re-searchers and PhD students in Computer science, of different na-tionalities, 23 men and 7 women, with ages ranging from 23 to 40. The experiment consisted of two different parts: for the first part participants were asked to mentally recall 6 desktop items  X  2 pic-tures, 2 songs and 2 URLs from the users X  bookmark list  X  which they did not access for a long time. For the case that study par-ticipants did not have some of the requested items on the personal desktop, we asked them to recall 2 photos which they once saw, 2 songs which they like hearing (e.g. on the radio) and 2 URLs of pages which they once visited and found interesting. Users had to write textual descriptions for each of them, BUT without looking at the pictures/Web pages and without listening to the music. They were requested to write descriptions as detailed as they could. Be-sides, for each of these resources, users had to provide a set of keywords best describing them.

In the second part of the experiment, participants were provided with the tag category descriptions and examples of tags for pictures, music and Web pages corresponding to each category. They were then asked to answer 3 questions: For all questions, users rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0  X  meaning  X  X ot useful at all X  (for the first two questions) /  X  X ot remembering at all X  (for question 3)  X  to 4  X  corresponding to  X  X ery useful for search X  and respectively  X  X ery good remembering X .
In the first part of the experiment we aimed at identifying which of the 8 tag categories were used by the users for describing re-called resources -and thus are implicitly most salient and best re-membered.

For this part we could only use the data of 24 participants, since for the remaining ones either descriptions or keywords were miss-ing. In total, we had descriptions and keywords for 145 resources (48 pictures, 49 songs and 48 URLs). We identified 1,307 concepts in either keywords or descriptions  X  Pictures: 291 in descriptions and 208 in keywords; Songs: 243 and 178; URLs: 223 and 164. On average, a picture had 6.06 concepts attached in the description and 4.33 in keywords. For songs the numbers are: 4.96 and 3.36 and for URLs: 4.65 and 3.42. The personal pictures elicited more memories written down in detail. This is probably partially due to their personal nature  X  in contrast to rather public songs and web pages. In general descriptions contained many details about the Usage context and Self reference .

Figure 6 shows the relative frequencies of the different cate-gories for descriptions and keywords. We observe that for URLs Topic and Usage context are most used in both descriptions and keywords; due to its factual nature Topic reaches over 50% for keywords. Self reference and Opinions/Qualities are also very fre-quently appearing in descriptions, but not as often in keywords. Looking at the descriptions, this is caused by people telling quite detailed stories about these resources and their associations. The category distribution for pictures is very similar to URLs except for a small drop in Topic and an increase in Location and Time . As we have already seen in earlier sections, the music domain is quite different. When describing songs, people tend to use much more Opinions/Qualities , Usage context and Self reference concepts then when using only keywords. Vice versa keywords are used more for Type and Author/Owner .

The keywords assigned by our participants thus exhibit simi-lar characteristics found in the analysis of Flickr , Del.icio.us and Last.fm presented in section 4.1.2. For web pages and pictures, actual relative frequencies deviate a little but ordering of category importance is almost the same except for the swap of Usage con-text and Location in Flickr . For music, we find more significant deviations: while in Last.fm Type is by far the most important cat-egory, the keywords are more often Author/Owner than Type and Topic . This is explained by Last.fm  X  X  system features, as artist and title are already provided as formal metadata. Independent of the resource type, Usage context is a very well remembered cat-egory, which certainly could be exploited and supported more in current tagging systems. Especially for pictures it provides new and only partially subjective information (e.g.  X  X HI2007 X ,  X  X ni-versiteit Twente X ). Also for music, we found them useful as inter-personal recommendations or associations (e.g.  X  X alsa course X ).
Except for the type frequencies, their appearance order is also an indicator of importance, as well as of easiness in recalling details pertaining to the different categories. In our study the participants almost always named Topic first in descriptions and keywords. The exception is music where for keywords Author/Owner was usually first, followed by Topic .
In the second part of the user study, we wanted to get an indi-cation of the users X  perception regarding the usefulness of differ-ent tag categories for searching both personal and non-personal re-sources (pictures, music files or Web pages). We also investigated which kinds of tags are best cues in order to recall a resource.
Figure 7a presents a detailed comparison of the 30 users X  rat-ings for usefulness and remembering of tag types for images. Rat-ings are very similar across the different activities of searching personal or public pictures and remembering  X  except Time and Type . Our participants remembered Time very well for their pic-tures and found it equally useful to search for them, but for public resources it is less valued as a retrieval cue. Often users do simply not know it. For Type it is opposite: Similar to the results of [17] people seem to find Type more useful for searching others X  pic-tures and also remember them, but they do not use it to search their own items  X  since they do not annotate or describe their pictures with such (semi-)professional photographic aspects. Differences Figure 7: User study results: a) Usefulness for personal, useful-ness for public, and level of remembrance of images; b) Useful-ness for public resources for different resource types are even smaller for most of the categories for Web resources and music.

As the ratings are very similar across the different activities of searching personal or public resources and remembering (the pair-wise Pearson correlation coefficients between the three activities range from 0.85 to 0.97), Figure 7b compares the 30 users X  rat-ings only on usefulness for searching public resources across Web pages, images, and music. Values vary across resources. Topic is the most useful and best remembered type of information for Web pages, followed by Usage context , Author/Owner and Type . Self reference , Time , and Location are judged neither useful nor well remembered. For pictures on the other hand, while Topic is still the most valuable category, the next ones are Location and Time . Usage context and Type are judged least important, probably due to perceived subjectivity of context and low (semi-)professional pho-tography knowledge. For music, best ratings were given for Au-thor/Owner , Type , and Topic , the others receiving a rather mediocre or low importance value. Opinions/Qualities is considered more useful for searching songs you do not have in your collection than it is for searching your favorite songs. As a surprise, it seems that people assume quite some agreement on subjective characteristics and opinions. We also found this tendency for URLs and pictures, though less pronounced.

Summarizing the results, substantial differences in perceived value of tag types exist only between resource types, each resource type having its own noticeable categories (e.g. Location for im-ages). Concerning the activity (remembering or searching for own or other people X  X  resources), there was only minor impact for Time or Type for pictures and Opinions/Qualities for music. However, for all resource types users rated  X  X actual X  categories, especially Topic , very high. On the other hand, Usage context and Opin-ions/Qualities were valued higher than we had intuitively expected.
Comparing categories of tags and queries as well as perceived usefulness provides some interesting insights: Figure 8 summarizes the differences and commonalities of how our eight categories are used for the different resource types. It compares the usage of tags (as described in Section 4.1.2) with the usage of queries (as de-scribed in Section 5.1) and the perceived level of usefulness by the users for public resources (as described in Section 5.2.3) for each of the categories. 3
Most of the general Web queries are Topic -related queries (as most of the tags for Del.icio.us , Flickr and AT ) and this category is also considered by far the most useful for search in particular for Web pages. Except for Topic users do not voice major differences in usefulness of the eight categories. However, we observe that some categories are more useful than others. For Web resources Topic tags are very useful, as over 30% of the queries target this cate-gory; but we also see that although users query the Author/Owner category, they usually do not tag in this way. For images the Topic category is considered by experiment participants very useful for search, and tags and queries of this kind are equally present. For images many queries are about Opinions/Qualities but users tend to add more Location tags than the needed Opinions/Qualities . So, even if users actually like to search for  X  X unny X  or  X  X trange X  pic-tures and judge them explicitly as partially useful for search, they often do not tag them in this way. As for the music domain, tags generally fall into the Type (i.e., genres) class, although more tags from Usage context and Topic categories would be needed ( Au-thor/Owner is already present).
Tag usage is rapidly increasing on the Web, providing potentially interesting information to improve search. To tap that potential, in this paper we extended previous preliminary work with a thorough analysis of the use of tags for different collections and in different environments. For the three popular and quite different collabo-rative tagging systems Del.icio.us , Flickr and Last.fm , as well as for Anchor Text ( AT ), we investigated the kinds of tags used, their distribution, and their suitability for improving search.
The paper provides evidence for the usefulness of a common tag classification scheme for different collections, which allows us to compare the kinds of tags used in different tagging environ-ments. We have shown that the distributions of tag types strongly depend on the resources they annotate: For Flickr , Del.icio.us and AT Topic -related tags are appearing in more than 50% of the cases, while for Last.fm the Type category is the most prominent one.
Other interesting findings reported in this paper refer to the added value of tags to existing content: More than 50% of exist-ing tags bring new information to the resources they annotate and for the music domain, this is the case for 98.5% of the tags. A large amount of tags is accurate and reliable, for the music domain for example 73.01% of the tags also occur in online music reviews.
Regarding search, our studies show that most of the tags can be used for search, and that in most cases tagging behavior ex-hibits approximately the same characteristics as searching behav-ior. We also observed some noteworthy differences: For the mu-sic domain, Usage context is very useful for search, yet underrep-resented in the tagging material. Similar, for pictures and music Opinions/Qualities queries occur quite often, although people tend to neglect this category for tagging. Clearly, supporting and moti-vating tags within these categories could provide additional infor-mation valuable for search.

Our results are promising and provide more insight into the use of different kinds of tags for improving search. They also indicate potential extensions of tagging environments to add an incentive for encouraging users to provide potentially search-relevant tags.
Note that usefulness scores have been scaled from a 0-4 scale to sum up over all categories to 100% in order to be suitable for this comparison.
Future interesting research questions include automatic tag clas-sification, as well as investigations for which kinds of queries can be supported by which kind of information (from tags, content or other metadata). This will help us to strategically extend existing information  X  gathered from different sources  X  and provide bet-ter support to queries especially for pictures and music resources which cannot be handled well enough by existing techniques.
