 1. Introduction In the field of Information Retrieval (IR), the Vector Space Model (VSM) is an important, well-understood and extensively researched classical model, which has been widely used to process texts efficiently and retrieve information for some forty years (Salton 1966). feature space based on frequencies of keywords appearing in the text. The feature space is mathematically modelled by the orthonormal Euclidean space, i.e., the space (or geometry) terms. So far, the Euclidean geometry is the only type of space used in the VSM in general, bu t non-Euclidean Geometry is becoming increasingly important in modern science and technology.

The application of non-Euclidean spaces to information processing in general seems to e xperience its beginnings: they are used for information visualisation. In a non-Euclidean e xponentially growing trees can be derived (Phillips and Gunn 1992, Phillips et al. 1993). They draw 3D hyperbolic pictures of large hierarchies or graphs (such as the Web) in the Thus, an effective way to visualise structures is obtained (more can be represented in less space, although in a distorted way; in a fisheye view style). 266 G  X  OTH AND SKROP
In Dominich (2002), using the concept of Shannon amount of information, an amount of uncertainty U associated with answers in VSM was defined as where  X  denotes the similarity measure X  X etween document d j and query q  X  X eing used. In Dominich (2002) the following results were obtained: (i) it was shown experimentally that the quantity U v aries depending on the similarity of information U in case of four retrieval measure, with three weighting schemas, and the percentages of the decrement of H in every case, for Belief Database.

From the point of view of the user, a parallel can be drawn between uncertainty and for Jaccard X  X  coefficient or Dot product with maxnorm scheme. In other words, such a VSM is less categorical as regards its answers.
 Example . The following example illustrates uncertainty, categoricity and the parallel be-tween them. Using the Google Search 1 with its Page Rank toolbar, the experiment with two different queries was carried out on the 2nd of January 2004.  X  X eat X  and  X  X orth Sea X  query terms were issued. The results are the following: V ARYING RETRIEVAL CATEGORICITY USING HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY 267 1. case : answers and their relevance degrees for the query  X  X eat X , as follows: 2. case : answers and their relevance degrees for the query  X  X orth Sea X , as follows: second case. Albeit in the VSM ranking determines the sequence order of answers, users, however, may prefer categorical answers as well, as these may be more convincing and help weighting scheme or similarity measure X  X his in turn yields costly re-computation of both weights and similarity measure values.

The present paper investigates the possibility of defining a new VSM, where the categoric-ity of the proposed retrieval system can be varied with less computation. A non-Euclidean space was applied to IR by defining a VSM in the hyperbolic space with a hyperbolic sim-ilarity measure. Experimental results are also reported, and it is shown that the new model is equivalent with the Cosine-based VSM with normalised weighting scheme. Moreover, it will be shown that the categoricity of the proposed retrieval system in the non-Euclidean space can be modified at lower computation costs, than in the VSM by just varying the radius of the space. 2. Vector Space Model and  X  -Space in a form used in the present paper.

Given documents D j , j = 1 ,..., m  X  N ( N denotes the set of natural numbers), and terms t i , i = 1 ,..., n  X  N .In the V ector Space Model (van Rijsbergen 1979, Salton and McGill 1983, Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999), briefly VSM ,o f Information Retrieval, W = ( w scheme (Berry and Browne 2000) is as follows: The vectors w j and q belong to the E n Euclidean orthonormal space, in which the weights w j and q are regarded as Cartesian coordinates (of points corresponding to document D j 268 G  X  OTH AND SKROP each other in one common point O (called the origin), they are pairwise perpendicular separate point for each document D j ). Thus, every document D j is represented by a vector w follows: where w j q denotes the inner X  X r dot X  X roduct of the vectors w j and q . Depending on the formula used to calculate the denominator ,s ev eral well-known similarity measures have been proposed over time, such as the Dot product, Cosine, and the coefficients (overlap, is obtained for = w j  X  q (  X  denotes the Euclidean norm of a vector). The concept of a  X  -space , introduced in Dominich (2001), is a formal generalization of the VSM in with a symmetric and reflexive similarity measure, i.e., are considered when computing the similarity value is indifferent; predefined and fixed maximal value  X  if the query and the document are exactly the same; the reverse is not necessarily true; for example, if  X  is normalised then  X  may be taken as being equal to 1. here without proof: Theorem. Let E , X  be a ( pseudo-) metric space (  X  is normalised , which is always a  X  -space.

The Cayley-Klein hyperbolic geometry or space (C-KHS) X  X r model X  X s an example for a Non-Euclidean geometry (Bolyai 1987); this is different form the Euclidean geometry line through a given point that is not on the given line) does not hold. Let R n denote the Rutherford 1965): Let radius r  X  R , r &gt; 0. The space C-KHS is S ( O , r ). The points P of the C-KHS are all of the hyper-sphere S deprived of their endpoints. If the lines m and n have one common endpoint (on the boundary of the hyper-sphere in the Euclidean space) they are referred to geometries is well-known (Anderson 1999). In our context, however, the hyperbolic distance rather than parallelism will play an important role.

The C-KHS space satisfies Hilbert X  X  axioms on incidence, ordering and congruence, as well as Archimedes X  and Cantor X  X  axioms on continuity (Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen 1932), the points U, A, B, V (figure 1(b)) as follows: where k  X  R is a positive constant, U and V are the points of intersection of the Euclidean line through the points A and B with the hyper-sphere. In the following, we will assume, without loss of generality, that k = 1.

Hyperbolic Information Retrieval Model In this part, a Hyperbolic IR (HIR) model is defined. This is the new VSM model in non-Euclidean space, where categoricity can be varied with less computation.

Given a VSM. Let R n denote the n -dimensional Euclidean space obtained by translating consider the following C-KHS: translated space S ( Q , r )i sa s follows: follows: V ARYING RETRIEVAL CATEGORICITY USING HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY 271 (b) metric-induced Hyperbolic similarity measure is defined as follows: Thus, the explicit form of the Hyperbolic similarity measure  X  H ( w , q )i sa s follows: Appendix B contains the proofs that the Hyperbolic similarity measure  X  H satisfies the similarity properties. 5. VSM and HIR: Equivalent models In this part, it will be shown that the HIR model and the VSM equiped with the Cosine measure are equivalent in an important practical case.

Tw oI R models or systems are equivalent if they produce the same ranking (Dominich 2001). As known (e.g., Meadow et al. 1999, Berry and Browne 2000), for technical disci-plines, the usage of the tfn weighting scheme is recommended as yielding good results. It will now be shown that the cosine similarity measure and the Hyperbolic measure preserve the rank order of documents under this weighting scheme.

Let d i , j mean the number of occurrences of term t i in document D j .( d ij could be any other value, in fact.) The normalised weighting scheme means that the terms are assigned normalised weights w ij as follows: under this weighting scheme, the Cosine and Hyperbolic measures  X  j become: 272 G  X  OTH AND SKROP respectively. Thus, one can write the following equivalence: from which it follows that: In other words, a given VSM based on the Cosine measure and using the tfn weighting scheme can be replaced with an hyperbolic IR model (producing exactly the same answers and ranking). 6. Radius of space as control variable for categoricity it is less categorical for the Cosine measure and tfn scheme, and most categorical for Dot product (or Jaccard coefficients) and maxnorm scheme.
 weighting scheme and without changing the similarity measure: it will suffice to vary the represents the advantage of being a means to make the categoricity of the Cosine-and tfn -based VSM (which is less categorical, see above) adjustable depending on only one control v ariable, namely the radius of the C-KHS. Thus, a modifiable categoricity can be obtained at much lower re-computation costs: only the similarity values need be re-computed but not the weights.

Given m documents D j , j = 1 ,..., m  X  N ( N denotes the set of natural numbers), and following:  X  X  n HIR, based on formula (1): mK = O ( m ), where K is a constant, corresponding to the time required by additions and multiplications (  X  H needs to be computed m times, without the computation of A , because the weighting schema does not change):  X  X  n VSM, based on the Dot product with maxnorm schema, and Cosine measure with tfn : 2 nm + C = O ( mn ) , where C is a constant ( Dot measure needs to be computed n  X  m V ARYING RETRIEVAL CATEGORICITY USING HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY 273 times, and the weights n  X  m times, because the weighting schema also change): in Section 7.3.

It is easy to see that the higher the radius r of the C-KHS the closer the hyperbolic similarity  X  H to unity, i.e.
This means that the higher the radius r the closer the amount of uncertainty U to its max-imum. In other words, increasing the radius of the hyperbolic space yields less categorical retrieval system, and conversely: decreasing the radius leads to more categorical answers. How much can the radius be reduced? It can be easily seen that the radius should be such that: In theory, if r becomes equal to max of the space, the document simply  X  X isappears X  in the infinity of the hyperbolic space, as shown by the following derivation: Hence, the categoricity of the hyperbolic retrieval system can be varied by changing its radius r between the following limits: 7. Experimental results In what follows, a medical database 2 will be used to illustrate the equivalence of VSM and HIR (Section 7.1), and the adjustable categoricity in HIR (Section 7.2). The Belief Test Database containing 2704 Hungarian belief texts, and Reuters Test Database containing 274 G  X  OTH AND SKROP using Hyperbolic Information Retrieval Model (Section 7.3).

The medical retrieval system is using a database containing medical cases. Each case includes two parts (figure 2 shows an example): (i) Computer Tomography (CT) images of the human patients X  brains (each case contains The cases were indexed using relevant medical terms in the written reports and a set of criteria relative to image content (figure 3).
 Both the medical terms and criteria were assigned weights. Thus, a document-term matrix case j (corresponding to a  X  X ocument X  D j ). 7.1. Equivalence of VSM and HIR HIR and VSM equiped with the Cosine measure are equivalent when using the tfn weighting schema. This property was proved formally in Section 5.

Experiments using the medical database with ten documents and ten index terms were the Cosine and Hyperbolic similarity values for the same query and for ten ( D 1 ... D 10 ) form. The solid line represents the similarity values of the Cosine measure, and the dotted line shows the Hyperbolic values. It can be clearly seen, that for every two documents the similarity values follows the same order, i.e., and the documents are rank in exactly the same order. E.g. document D 6 is the most relevant to the query Q in the Cosine measure (0.617), and in the Hyperbolic measure (0.483) also. 7.2. Adjustable categoricity in HIR In HIR, changing the radius of the space can vary categoricity of the system. Table 3 and figure 5 represent the modification of categoricity as a function of radius. Table 3 shows the similarity values for a given query and ten ( D 1 ... D 10 ) documents from the medical database in the case of Hyperbolic measure with 4 different radii, and Cosine measure. In figure 5 the X-axis denotes the documents, and Y-axis the similarity values. The solid line 276 G  X  OTH AND SKROP represents the categoricity extent of the VSM, which is unchanged in all (a X  X ) cases. The dotted line shows the extent of categoricity in HIR model. The radius rises from case (a) becomes more uncertain by increasing the radius. 7.3. Modifiable categoricity at lower re-computation costs by using HIR V ARYING RETRIEVAL CATEGORICITY USING HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY 277 coefficient or Dot product with maxnorm scheme (Table 1). Due to this property, taking another similarity measure and weighting schema can vary the categoricity in VSM model. However, in HIR categoricity can be varied without taking another similarity measure and goricity can be obtained at lower re-computation costs: only the similarity values need be re-computed but not the weights.

Comparative experiments were carried out using the following databases: 7.3.1. Belief Database. It contains 2704 belief text, and 2607 index terms. The text pre-as well as conjugated/declined forms) were identified manually as baring no or very little 278 G  X  OTH AND SKROP akkire  X . After the automatic removal of the stop words there remained 14,286 word forms. The word forms were then stemmed manually. For example, the following declined word to  X  csont  X  meaning  X  X one X . A further difficulty stemmed from the very many composed w ords, which are typical for the Hungarian language (just like in German or Finnish, for instance). A further and very special difficulty was posed by old homonym words which are not being used anymore in contemporary Hungarian; for example, the words  X  bety  X  oleges, number of 2,607 terms in a correct contemporary Hungarian spelling, which were used as index terms for the belief texts. The average number of terms per text was 15. 7.3.2. Part of Reuters Database. It contains 7000 documents and 32589 index terms. The text pre-processing was carried out automatically. After the automatic removal of the stop w ords using the stop list TIME, terms were generated automatically, without stemming. Stemming was not necessary for these experiments, because the database is not being used for retrieval. The average number of terms per document was 73. 7.3.3. Generated term-by-document matrix. The influence of a larger database on running time a term-by-document matrix wa s generated using a program written in C language for this purpose. The dimension of the matrix is 2000  X  100000 simulating 100000 documents, and 2000 index terms. The average number of terms per document is 15, which was generated by RAND (random number variable) function.
 The computational time of the weights ( tfn , maxnorm ) and similarity values (Cosine, Hyperbolic, Dot) can be seen in Table 4 (for Belief Test Database), in Table 5 (for Reuters T est Collection) and in Table 6 (for the generated term-by-document matrix). The compu-tational time was measured by using the clock function. The time is given in seconds, and one clock tick is 1 ms.

Cosine similarity measure with tfn is equivalent to hyperbolic measure with tfn (it was proved in part 5 and 7.1.), and to Dot product with maxnorm weighting scheme also. V ARYING RETRIEVAL CATEGORICITY USING HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY 279
The result of the comparison (running time of varying uncertainty for the same ranking order) can be seen in Table 7. It shows that the time of modifying categoricity in HIR is much less than in the VSM (from Cosine with tfn to Dot with maxnorm ), because in HIR only the radius of the space is changing, so only a part of the similarity measure needs be re-computed, while in VSM the weighting scheme and similarity measures are both 280 G  X  OTH AND SKROP changed, so they both need be re-computed. Consequently, it can be clearly seen that a system with modifiable categoricity can be obtained at much lower re-computation costs by just changing the radius in HIR . 8. Conclusions Euclidean geometry is the only type of space used in the VSM thus for. The paper pro-posed a retrieval model over the Cayley-Klein Hyperbolic Geometry. After presenting the classical Vector Space Model, and the Cayley-Klein Geometry with their properties, the Hyperbolic Information Retrieval model was defined using a similarity measure, derived from the hyperbolic distance. It was shown that this model was equivalent with the tradi-tional Vector Space Model using a normalized weighting scheme, because both preserved the ranking order of the retrieved documents. Experiments were also reported implementing the proposed hyperbolic VSM.

It was also shown that the uncertainty (or categoricity) of answers in HIR can be varied by only changing the radius of the space but keeping the weights; while in the VSM, the same effect can only be obtained by applying a different weighting scheme and similarity measure, and hence this means much more computation to be carried out.
