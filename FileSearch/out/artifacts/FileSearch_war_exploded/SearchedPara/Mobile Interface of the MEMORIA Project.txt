 This project develops tools to manage personal memories that include a multimedia retrieval system and user inter-faces for different devices. This paper and demonstration presents the mobile interface which allows browsing, retriev-ing, and taking pictures that are automatically annotated with GPS data and audio information. The multimedia re-trieval system uses multimodal information: visual content, GPS metadata and audio information. The interface was evaluated in a cultural heritage site.

People are collecting a huge amount of media information related to their personal experiences and they have difficul-ties in organizing these agglomerations. In effect, the lack of structure in multimedia collections can result in misplaced images or inability to appreciate recollections. If possible, collecting and retrieving personal memories should not mean time-consuming file organization but a pleasing experience. The Memoria project develops a new set of tools for storing and retrieving personal digital memories without any kind of user organization. It comprises a multimedia retrieval system, and several user interfaces. This paper describes the mobile version, which runs on a PDA. With the mobile interface users can access the system features ubiquitously, share their pictures instantly and on location.

The proposed mobile interface allows browsing, retrieving of photos and taking pictures that are automatically anno-tated with GPS data and audio information. The multi-media retrieval system that uses visual content and context metadata (GPS data and audio information) is triggered by the user interface by means of queries composed by the user. These queries can be defined by concepts [1], location information, audio information and visual content or also by a composition of the previous ones. The queries results are visualized in the user interface. This application was
