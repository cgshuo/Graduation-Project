 In this paper, we propose a personalized and contextual ranking algorithm implemented on top of the 3A interaction model. The latter is a generic model intended for designing and describing social and collaborative learning platforms integrating Actors, As sets and group Activities (the 3  X  X  X ). The target user X  X  interactions with his/her environment are modeled in a heterogeneous graph. Then, the algorithm is applied to simultaneously rank actors, assets and group activities taking into account the target us er and his/her context. As an illustrative application and a preliminary evaluation, we apply the algorithm on data related to the activities carried out in a European Research Project, especially the collaboration between its members through the joint pro duction of deliverables in workpackages.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: information search and retrieval  X  information filtering Algorithms, Design, Human Factors Collaboration, Markov models, PageRank, Recommendation systems, CSCW, Social Software Early CSCW (Computer -Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) and CSCL (Computer -Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) apparatus reported the problem of low participatio n [1]. Today, Web 2.0 social software applications better succeed in fostering user -generated content, online interaction, and information sharing. Their popularity is due to their low -entry barriers, user -friendly interfaces, flexibility, and easy -to-use features. Furthermore, their initial success in informal settings for building and/or maintaining friendship ties, have lead to their adoption in formal environments. Enterprise 2.0 is a term referring to the adoption and the spreading of the social softwa re bottom -up sharing philosophy among employees of the same enterprise, as well as beyond enterprise boundaries. In the same way, eLearning 2.0 refers to the application of social software in education in order to support personal and group learning. As o nline exchange in different forms is continuously growing thanks to the success of Web 2.0 solutions, the challenge is no longer to trigger contribution. It is rather to drive the user X  X  attention to the most important contributions depending on his/her co ntext. In this paper, the 3A contextual ranking system that takes its roots from the original PageRank random walk algorithm is presented. This algorithm simultaneously ranks assets, actors and group activities for a particular target user within a particu lar context. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly presents the 3A interaction model and then describes our contextual and multi -relational ranking approach. Section 3 describes the algorithm X  X  application and the results of its preliminary evaluation in the context of the Palette European Research Project (http://palette.ercim.org/). Related work is discussed in Section 4. The paper is concluded in Section 5 with hints on future work. The 3A interaction model takes its roots from Activity Theory but is particularly intended for designing and describing social and collaborative environments [2]. It consists of three main constructs referred hereafter as entities: Actors represent entities capable of initiating an event in a collaborative environment, such as regular users or agents. Actors conduct Group Activities to reach specific objectives. Assets represent artifacts produced, edited, shared and annotated by actors in order to mediate collaboration and meet objectives of group activities. They can consist for example of simple text files, RSS feeds, content of wikis, as well as video and audio files. There are three types of asset access rights: own ership , edit orship and read -on ly. A role consists of a label and an associated set of rights granted to an actor within an activity. Furthermore, the latter can possibly have a well -defined planning of expected assets with concrete submission and evaluation deadlines, predefined evalua tors and submitters. This is particularly useful in project management communities and online educational environments. The model accounts for Web 2.0 features: entities can be tagged, shared and rated. Moreover, actors can define any type of bidirectional and unidirectional semantic links between entities of the same type. For instance, an actor can be a  X  X o -worker X  of another actor and a group activity can consist of a  X  X ub -activity X  of another one. Section 3 presents an example of a mapping of the Palett e project X  s structure and members X  interactions into the 3A model.
 The objective is to develop a ranking algorithm able to order the 3A entities (actors, assets, and group activities) according to their importance to a target actor and to his/her specific context. We rely on the target user X  X  relations and interactions with the workspace to leverage the importance of the different entities to the target user and his/her current context. This is motivated by two main reasons. First, early studies have revealed that people are not always ready to explicitly express their preferences and priorities . As a matter of fact, people perceive such actions as extrinsic to their work and as requiring extra effort [1]. Second, studies have shown that when it comes to assessing and filtering the information at hand, people are highly influenced by the ir trusted networks of friends and colleagues [3,4]. The link -based approach adopted to achieve contextual and multi -rela tional ranking can be summarized in four main steps. First, for each target user, a directed graph is constructed, where the target user X  X  related actors, assets and group activities are represented as nodes, and the inter -relations between them as edges. Intermediary entities such as roles and tags are also incorporated in the graph as nodes, depending on the relations considered and the level of granularity worth keeping track of. In addition, each bidirectional relation is translated into two directed ed ges. Moreover, some initially unidirectional relations (e.g. being the author of an asset) are complemented by another edge going in the opposite direction , in such a way that the two related nodes reinforce one another. Second, a set of nodes is selected representing the target user X  X  context. If the actor is working within a particular activity, then its members, assets, roles, and explicitly related activities constitute its context. In the case where a user is performing a query, the assets, actors, rol es, group activities and tags that are in his/her network and contain in their name or description the entered keyword(s) are considered as target nodes. In the future, m ore sophisticated content -based techniques such as tf/idf (term frequency -inverse document frequency ) will be considered for selecting contextual nodes based on their relevancy to a target user X  X  query . Third , the multi -relational contextual ranking algorithm is applied on the graph. Last but not least, separate lists of actors, assets, and group activities are extracted whilst respecting their relative order in the original heterogeneous list. The algorithm presented in this paper takes its roots from the original PageRank algorithm developed by Page and Brin for ranking hypertext documents for Google [6]. The key idea of this algorithm is that the importance of a Web page, or the probability to land on it, depends upon the number of the pages that point to it as well as their importance. We explain below how Web pages are ranked using this algorithm. Let N denote the total number of Web pages, OutDegree( j ) the total number of outgoing links from a page(node) j . A transition matrix T ( N  X  N ) is defined such that, each entry T 1/OutDegree( j ) if j points to i , and 0 otherwise. Dangling pages (pages with no outgoing links) are considered to link to all nodes in the graph with an equal probability. For that, a matrix 
D ( N  X  N ) is defined such that all entries are 0 except for the dangling columns where entries are equal 1 N . Let defined as the random jump parameter and d as the damping factor. d represents the probability to follow page links instead of jumping on a random page. Then, the iterative stationary probability equation of landing on a node i (or rank of a Web page i ) is given by: It can be understood as the probability for a random surfer to land on a page or node probability, following random links with a probability of d and randomly jumping on a page with a prob ability of Unlike the graph of hypertext documents of the original PageRank algorithm, our social graph involves heterogeneous nodes (i.e. actors, assets, group activities, tags) related by different types of edges th at are not necessarily equally important. In that case, a node X  X  importance rank does not only depend upon the number of nodes linking to it and their importance as it is the case for the original PageRank algorithm, but also on the weight of its incoming links. In this section, we explain how we adapted the original algorithm to take this into account. Let E denote the set of all types of edges. We define for each edge type e  X  E a transition matrix T e ( N  X  N ) a nd a corresponding weight w e . Let OutDegree e ( j ) be defined as the number of edges of type e outgoing from j . Then, as in PageRank, T of a few collaborative a ctions where transition probabilities between nodes are treated in a special way. Notably, in the transition matrix corresponding to the action of "rating", the transition probability equal to the actual rate value normalized by dividing it by the sum of all rates given by actor i . In the same way, in the case of  X  X pdates X , node j , divided by the total numb er of updates performed by j . Moreover, nodes that don X  X  have outgoing links of type e are considered as dangling nodes for relation e. Consequently, for each type of relation e , we define a matrix D e ( N  X  N ) such that all entries are 0 exc ept for the dangling nodes columns where entries are equal to 1 N . Then, the iterative stationary probability equation of landing on a node i, is given by: with w e In order to take into account the evolution of the graph over time, we suggest defining significant time frames, and then grouping relations according to their nature as well as the time frame during which they occurred, giving a higher relative weight to more recent ones. White and Smith [7] showed how PageRank can be extended to rank nodes according to their relative importance to a root set of N X  nodes. Their approach consists of evaluating the probability for a random surfer of landing on a node n in a Markov chain, starting at a root set with adequate prior probabilities, and ending with a probability  X  in the root set (where it restarts again). Borrowing from their work, we make the 3A ranking algorithm contextual. In our case, the ranking should be biased towards the target user and his/her context. To do so, we introduce two parameters  X  c and  X  u .  X  c represents the probability to jump back to the contextual nodes and probability to jump back to the target user. Also, the initial probability is set to 0 except for contextual nodes. Let N X  be the number of contextual nodes, then each of them receives an equal initial probability of 1 N ' . We define p c as a variable equal to 1 N ' for contextual nodes, and 0 otherwise, and p variable equal to 1 for the target user X  X  node and 0 otherwise. Then, the complete iterative stationary probability equation of landing node i is given by: with w e To sum up, equation 3 can be interpreted as the probability to fall on a node in the graph , starting within a set of contextual nodes, follow ing different types of links with a probability of d (each wi th a probability of w e ), jump ing to random nodes with a probability of , jump ing to the target actor with a probability of  X  u , then go ing back to one of the contextual nodes with a probability of  X  c (and restarting again). As an illustrative application and a preliminary evaluation of the proposed algorithm, we apply it on data related to the scientific community involved in the Palette research Project. This community is composed of 106 researchers ( i.e. actors) and includes 65 deliverables (i.e . submitted assets), 9 workpackages (or WPs), and 19 institutions. We use a collaborative Web 2.0 application ( http:// elogbook.epfl.ch/) based on the 3A model to represent the Palette network shown in Figure 1. WPs and institutions are considered as group activities where actors can have administrative or non -administrative rol es. We treat the keywords associated with each deliverable as tags, but we have no trace of who among the asset authors had added it. Throughout the evaluation we choose d = 0.64 ,  X  c = 0.3 , and  X  u = 0.01 . The evaluation is performed using a post -collaboration questionnaire addressed to Palette members. 20 people replied to the questionnaire. The first question consisted of ranking the 8 research WPs according to one X  X  personal activity (an administrative WP w as omitted for consistency). The average Spearman coefficient obtained by comparing personal rankings and automatic rankings is 0.915 with a standard deviation of 0.15. It is indeed not surprising that the activity of people in WPs coincides with the proje ct structure and plan (membership in WPs, joint production of preset deliverables). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that this high correlation was obtained after having tuned the relative importance of the 9 different relations as illustrated in Figure 1: from the thickest to the thinnest, edges represents relations having a weight of 2/11, 1/11 an 1/22 respectively. For instance, having edited or submitted a deliverable is con sidered as twice more important than being a WP leader and four times more important than having accessed or evaluated a deliverable. The high correlation obtained from this preliminary study, shows that when it comes to assessing one X  X  activity in WPs , having managed and contributed to the production of a WP  X  X  deliverable matters more than being a WP leader or having evaluated a deliverable. In general, f or relations that are not intuitive to order , similar studies can give an insight into which combinatio n of weight s best meet s people X  X  expectations.
 In the second question, researchers were asked to choose among the 106 Palette researchers those with whom they have interacted the most. Answers are compared to lists of researchers generated by the algorithm taking as target actors the people who answered the questionnaire, one by one. The average R -precision for that question is 0.52 with a standard deviation of 0.17. This low correlation can be partially explained by the fact that the collaboration between people doesn X  X  only depend on the joint production of project deliverables. Had there been a trace of the members X  discussions and interactions, the algorithm would have possibly returned a more precise measure of collaboration. Finally, the last task con sisted of recommending researchers from the Palette network for an imaginary learner seeking help on four different topics. The topics chosen (namely  X  X wareness X ,  X  X sability X ,  X  X emantic Web X ,  X  X nteroperability X ) are topics that Palette researchers have wor ked on during three years within different WPs. For each topic, we form ed a reference list of the top 10 most cited researchers. The algorithm was then run taking as context all the WPs and deliverables whose tags, names and descriptions match the topic. W e obtain ed an average R -precision of 0.73 with a standard deviation of 0.1. Many studies tackled the problem of ranking and recommending resources and experts to users of online Web applications. A big part of those studies focus on tagging and social bookmarking behavior [8,9,10]. For example, TC -SocialRank [10] presents a link -based algorithm for folksonomy systems that ranks users, bookmarks and shared resources taking into account temporal and user -clicks information. The 3A model summarized in this paper is focused on collaborative environments where actions are not limited to social bookmarking and tagging and are not necessarily equally important. This requires more general approach es than the ones described above. General link -analysis algorithms can be found in the literature [11,12,13]. Wang et al. present in [12] a genera l approach based on a random walk algorithm that computes the importance of objects of different types in an educational portal. In [13], Li et al. tackle the same problem of ordering the users activities according to their predicted priority. They present a personalized activity prioritization approach based on a ranking Support Vector Machine model, which learns the user priorities according to his/her past interactions with the system. Our approach also exploits the user actions. Nevertheless, ranking is not limited to activities but also extends to assets and actors. Second, our approach allows defining different weights for the different relations considered. Third, borrowing from [7], our algorithm takes into account the target user X  X  context, which is not the case for the other approaches discussed in this section. The paper describes a contextual and multi -relational ranking algorithm intended to rank actors, assets, and group activities. The algorithm relies on the target us er previous interactions with the workspace to predict the importance of each entity to him/her. A future study of the algorithm X  X  sensitivity to its different parameters is essential for its validation. In addition, further experiments will be run to iden tify adequate weights X  distribution for the significant relation types linking entities of a collaborative platform. Furthermore, the algorithm will be evaluated using larger datasets and compared to other uni -relational and multi -relational recommendation algorithms. Moreover, we plan to deploy it and evaluate it within a collaborative Web 2.0 platform (elogbook.epfl.ch). Finally, we will also consider implementing recommender applications dedicated to users of popular networking platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn, and then assessing their efficiency and acceptability.
