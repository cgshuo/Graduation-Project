 1. Introduction
The research problem addressed in this paper is the growing and crucial need for a greater understanding of human multitasking and information problem ordering processes. Multitasking is the human ability to handle
When humans multitask, they work on two or more tasks, order those tasks, and switch between those types of tasks such as talking on the telephone, computing tasks or reading tasks and information tasks. In problems can evolve and change over time.

In addition, the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines ordering as arranging or regulating to elimi-nate confusion and setting a sequence. Task ordering studies are important to the study of human factors, enable humans to choose, prioritize and order tasks, and monitor, interrupt and adjust task performance tasks and allocate resources to them thus allowing efficient multiple-task performance X  X  (p. 2).
In the realm of information and human-computer interaction tasks, when people use a Web search engine multiple information problems or second they begin with a single information problem and then develop addi-during a search session. For example, a person may switch between seeking health information and new car information as they think and work on multiple information problems concurrently ( Spink et al., 2006 ).
In this paper we report the results of a study of information problem ordering during Web search. Spink (2004) suggested that factors that affect personal or non-assigned information problem ordering driven are level of personal interest and problem familiarity. Limited research has focused on how people order their information problems when seeking information or search the Web. Information problem ordering is an important research area for understanding the cognitive processes associated with information behavior, including Web search with implications for personalization and user modeling.

The next section of the paper provides some background research related to our study. 2. Related research 2.1. Multitasking, dual tasking and task switching
Multitasking is a critical human behavior that allows people to cope with ever more complex environments microsecond level of behavior, experimental psychologists are studying many aspects of multitasking, dual of tasks simultaneously can reduce human productivity on both tasks. Schumacher et al. (2001) discuss how humans perform two distinct perceptual-motor or cognitive tasks simultaneously and argue that dual-task performance of perceptual motor tasks does slow due to mental scheduling process problems. Rogers and
Monsell (1995) examine the costs of switching between simple cognitive tasks. Kray and Lindenberger (2000) found adult age differences in task switching. 2.2. Task prioritization/ordering
Freed (2000) suggests that task management and prioritization are affected by urgency, time, importance, importance, and environmental stimuli and events. They state that  X  X  X ne open issue is how executive control identify task importance as the main factor in task prioritization by pilots.

More generally, Gopher and North (1977) and Navon and Gopher (1979) found that during laboratory task prioritization.
 Alternatively, a growing body of studies is beginning to investigate multitasking information behavior.
However, limited studies have investigated how people order information tasks. 2.3. Multitasking information behavior and information problem switching
Recent studies have begun to explore multitasking information behavior and information problem switch-an important research area for information and Web technology designers ( Maclntyre et al., 2001 ). Studies show that Web users often engage in multitasking information behaviors ( Spink, Ozmutlu, &amp; Ozmutlu, of technologies that support multitasking search and lead to improvement in search technology performance.
Our approach to studying and modeling multitasking search is strongly based on and extends previous research findings from empirical studies that are discussed below.

Spink et al. (2002) found that Web searchers often search on more than one information problem during a of 2 X 10+ problems per search, and (3) are longer than single problem search sessions with more keywords and mation problem and then switching to search for items on another information problem. Users often think and work concurrently on multiple information problems, but search for information on Web/IR technologies sequentially. IR system users X  expressed problems in coordinating, tracking and managing their multitasking searches ( Spink et al., 2002 ). Users X  multitasking, coordination and management of different information search tasks is little understood or supported by current search technologies.
 Studies show that people often have many information problems at hand at the same time ( Spink, 2004 ).
For example, a person may pool their information problems together and interact with the Web on more than library may consist of seeking information on single or multiple information problems, and also switching among information problems ( Spink et al., 2002 ).
 In 1999, Spink, Bateman, and Greisdorf (1999) found that 11 (3.8%) of the 287 Excite users responding to a information seeking and searching is a common human behavior as many IR system users conduct information sessions are longer than single information problem sessions with mean problems per Web search ranging from one to more than 10 information problems and a mean of 2.11 information problem changes per search session.
Recent studies have examined multitasking searching on the Excite and AlltheWeb.com Web search multitasking sessions on AlltheWeb.com and show that almost one third of AlltheWeb.com users perform multitasking Web searching. Multitasking Web search sessions often included more than three information problems per session, are longer in duration than regular searching sessions, and most of the information problems in multitasking searches were switching among general information, computers and entertainment.
Ozmutlu, Ozmutlu, and Spink (2003b) found that multitasking Web searches are a noticeable user behav-titasking Web search sessions are longer than regular search sessions in terms of queries per session and duration, with both Excite and AlltheWeb.com users searching for about three information problems per mul-titasking session and submitting about 4 X 5 queries per information problem.

They found that library users often engage in multitasking and complex information problem switching during when people have multiple concurrent information problems, they seek information on higher domain knowl-edge information and high personal interest problems before other information problems. Spink X  X  (2004) com-ments were based on a case study where the study participant was seeking information on their own personal problems.

Spink, Park, and Cole (2005) conceptualize IR as a multitasking process. Spink et al. (2006) analyzed a 2002. Sessions ranged in duration from less than a minute to a few hours. Findings include: (1) 81% of two-query sessions included multiple information problems, (2) 91.3% of three or more query sessions included multiple information problems, (3) there are a broad variety of information problems in multitasking search sessions, and (4) three or more query sessions sometimes contained frequent information problem changes. Multitasking is found to be a growing element in Web searching.

Spink and Park (2005) discuss the interplay of information and non-information problems, provided a model of problem switching between information problem ( Fig. 1 ).

Based on an examination of previous multitasking research, Spink and Park (2005) suggest that informa-tion problem ordering and switching may be affected by the many factors, including the (1) nature and com-plexity of content in relation to the information seeker X  X  domain knowledge , (2) amount and depth of the information seeker in relation to their information problem.

In summary, various studies have identified that people often engage in information problem switching and have suggested factors that may affect information problem ordering. Further research is needed to under-stand how people order their information problems, to contribute to the development of better theoretical model of information searching or seeking behavior. 3. Research goals
The overall goal of our exploratory study is to investigate human assigned information problem ordering to enhance our understanding of Web search behavior.

The specific goals of the study are to examine: (1) If users seek information on higher level of domain knowledge or higher personal interest information (2) Factors that affect users X  ordering of assigned information problems during Web search.
This study is a continuation and enlargement of multitasking information behavior studies by the authors ( Spink, 2004; Spink et al., 2002; Spink et al., 2005; Spink et al., 2006 ). 4. Research design 4.1. Data collection 4.1.1. Study participants The study included the collection of data from 40 students engaged in information search problems via a Web search engine about their search behavior. A group of 40 volunteers participated in the study. They are demic or administrative activities. They regularly search the Web, CD-ROM databases, and computerized technologies for information.

A Call for Participation in the study was distributed throughout the School via email and notice-to allow for any attrition or data collection problems from some participants, to ensure that data is col-regarding their participation and rights/protections under the University of Pittsburgh Institutional
Review Board (IRB) Human Subjects Research guidelines. A pilot study was conducted during the first month of the study with two student participants to pretest and refine the data collection and analysis techni-ques. 4.1.2. Study procedures
Each of the 40 study participants searched the Web using the Web search engine of their choice for infor-mation on three general knowledge problems listed below in the University of Pittsburgh, School of Informa-tion Sciences Computing Lab. Three general knowledge problems were chosen: 1. Find biographical information on Bill Gates of Microsoft. 2. Find information on the disease rheumatic fever. 3. Create a one-page list, which includes 5 items of books, articles or papers about Miami Beach.
Participants were also asked to find information on the same three information problems that were pre-sented to then in random order. During the data collection, user search interaction was recorded using Cam-tasia Studio. Think aloud protocols were collected and each participant was interviewed about their Web search processes.

A pre-search interview questionnaire, provided in Appendix A , was used to collect data on individual level express the reasons for their Web search actions. This  X  X  X hinking aloud X  X  stream was audio-taped and later transcribed by the research assistant. Subjects X  searches were recorded and stored onto a disk for further analysis. 4.2. Data analysis
Both quantitative and qualitative analysis methods were used. The data analyzed included the search logs, with these interactions. We focused on understanding how users construct and manage multitasking searches, including the process of information problem switching and coordination. Results of the content analysis of the questionnaires and interview notes were used to develop preliminary typologies and orderings of Web search behaviors. 5. Results 5.1. Demographic characteristics Table 1 shows the age of the forty (40) study participants.

Most of the study participants were between the age of 21 and 34 years old. No person under the age of 18 was included in the study. Two-thirds of the study participants were male and one-third was female. Most of ment ( Table 2 ). 5.2. Web use characteristics 5.2.1. Frequency of Web use Table 3 show the frequency of Web use by study participants.

Most study participants stated that they used the Web on a daily basis. This finding is not unexpected for student study participants. 5.2.2. Web browser use Table 4 shows the Web browser used by the study participants.

Most study participants were users of the Internet Explorer or the Firefox Web browsers. 5.2.3. Years of Web experience Table 5 shows the years of Web experience by the study participants.
 Most study participants had between 6 and 10 years of Web experience.
 5.2.4. Web search engine used Table 6 shows the Web search engine used by each study participant.

Most study participants were users of the Google Web search engine. 5.3. Information problem ordering Table 7 shows how the study participants ordered the three Web search problems.
 The problem ordering data shows that: Nearly 1 in 2 study participants X  first Web search was for information on Bill Gates.
 Nearly 2 in 3 study participants conducted their second Web search on the information problem of Miami Beach.

Nearly 2 in 3 study participants conducted their third Web search on the information problem of rheumatic fever.
 Overall, the search information problem order for most study participants was first Bill Gates, then Miami ticipants X  information problem ordering.
 5.4. Factors affecting information problem ordering Table 8 shows the factors that affected study participants X  information problem ordering.
Our study findings show that information problem ordering was affected by the following factors X  X roblem problem knowledge were the major factors in determining information problem ordering shown in Table 7 . 5.4.1. Personal interest X  X igh to low the most interesting problem amongst the three X  X . 5.4.2. Problem familiarity-high to low
Some 25% of the study participants listed high problem familiarity as a major factor in their information  X  X  X y my estimation of my familiarity with each of the problems X  X . 5.4.3. Ease of finding problem information on the Web X  X igh to low
Nearly 20% of study participants listed high ease of finding problem information on the Web as a major participants than personal interest or problem knowledge. One study participant stated  X  X  X  thought findings books articles about Miami Beach will be easy. I decided to do that problem first X  X . 5.4.4. Problem knowledge X  X ow to high
Interestingly, four study participants focused first on Web searches for which they had low problem knowl-edge. Such ordering may have been driven by curiosity or a desire to explore new problems. One study par-ticipant stated  X  X  ordered my problems from least knowledge to most knowledge. In other words, I picked the problem I had the least knowledge about to the one I had more knowledge about. Sometimes, it takes longer to find valuable information about problems with which I have little knowledge X  X . This study participant ordered their problems as first rheumatic fever, followed by Miami Beach and then Bill Gates.
A second study participant stated  X  X  X  ordered my search problems by how much I thought I knew about life so I did that one last. I wanted to do the hardest problem first X  X . 5.4.5. Personal interest X  X ow to high
One participant ordered their Web searches by focusing first on problems for which they had low interest lowed by Bill Gates and then rheumatic fever. The other study participant who also ordered their searches from low to high interest, started with rheumatic fever, followed by Bill Gates and then Miami Beach. 5.4.6. Random order
Two study participants listed randomness as a factor in their information problem ordering. Serendipity is more unusual in problem ordering that involves using equipment such as airplanes, but previous studies have ordered them randomly, I don X  X  really mind what order I searched for them in X  X . 5.4.7. Level of problem importance X  X ow to high ing. This study participant first searched for information on Bill Gates, followed by Miami Beach and then rheumatic fever, and stated  X  X  X inally looked for books, articles and papers about Miami Beach because ... matic Fever X  X . 5.4.8. Search problems X  X east specific to most specific
One study participant ordered their Web searches from least specific to most specific problem. This study participant first searched for information on Bill Gates, followed by Miami Beach and then rheumatic fever, come up with search terms and I thought it sounded like the most general X  X .

In summary, personal interest was the major factors driving assigned information problem ordering, fol-lowed by a high level of problem knowledge and a high ease of finding information on that problem. 6. Discussion
Our study results provide insights into the information behavior of people seeking information. Spink (2004) suggested that factors that affect personal or non-assigned information problem ordering driven are information problems, personal interest and problem familiarity affected information problem ordering. Per-tion on a problem were also major factors.

Previous studies show that due to complex information needs, many people are seeking information on more than one problem concurrently. People may batch their interaction with an IR system and search on mation problem batching process, the priority/order of people X  X  information problems is influenced by their level of personal interest in and personal knowledge of the information problem.

Interestingly, most people ordered their information problems from a high to low level of personal interest or problem familiarity. However, some study participants ordered their information problems from low to high level of personal interest or problem familiarity. Those who approached the problems from low to high This may also reflect how these study participants approach different types of problems in general.
Some study participants were conducting the harder, more challenging or more unpleasant problems first, first and then move to more difficult or challenging problems. Within information behavior studies, Chatman tion. However, limited research has examined information behavior and gratification theory.
Our findings differ from previous task ordering studies that have largely focused on crew and pilot prob-lem management ( Iani &amp; Wickens, 2004 ). Key factors that affected problem ordering in previous human factors studies were task importance, time and duration. The differences may reflect the differences in the tasks studied. Crew and pilot task performance studies largely focus on safety and effectiveness issues.
Our study found limited focus by study participants on information problem importance, time or duration as factors that affected information problem prioritization and ordering. For Web information problems that are embedded in seeking behaviors, performance is measured as the quality of the information retrieved and its contribution to the resolution of peoples X  information problems ( Spink, 2002 ). However, these factors may be different in Web search situations where the subjects are under time pressure, e.g., in a business environment.

Limitation of this study include the use of assigned information problems using a small sample size of Uni-ted States undergraduate and graduate students as study participants. Further studies are needed to examine information problem ordering for non-assigned information problems.

Findings from this exploratory study have implications for our understanding and modeling of human information behavior. Information systems and services are needed to support people working through their multiple and complex information problems. The current study is in need of replication and expansion. 7. Conclusion and further research
In conclusion, the results reported here support Spink X  X  (2004) suggestion that when people have multiple concurrent information problems, they seek information on higher domain knowledge information and high and critical area of information science research.

We are conducting further studies of information problem prioritization and ordering in non-assigned problem environments. Further research is also need to examine the relationship between information prob-lem management and gratification theory.
