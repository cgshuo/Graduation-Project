 The task of information extraction (IE) involves au-tomatic extraction of typed entities and relations from unstructured text. IE systems (Cowie and Lehnert, 1996; Sarawagi, 2008) are trained to extract facts that are stated explicitly in text. However, some facts are implicit, and human readers naturally  X  X ead between the lines X  and infer them from the stated facts using commonsense knowledge. Answering many queries can require inferring such implicitly stated facts. Consider the text  X  X arack Obama is the president of the United States of America. X  Given the query  X  X arack Obama is a citizen of what coun-try? X , standard IE systems cannot identify the an-swer since citizenship is not explicitly stated in the text. However, a human reader possesses the com-monsense knowledge that the president of a country is almost always a citizen of that country, and easily infers the correct answer.

The standard approach to inferring implicit infor-mation involves using commonsense knowledge in the form of logical rules to deduce additional in-formation from the extracted facts. Since manually developing such a knowledge base is difficult and arduous, an effective alternative is to automatically learn such rules by mining a substantial database of facts that an IE system has already automatically extracted from a large corpus of text (Nahm and Mooney, 2000). Most existing rule learners assume that the training data is largely accurate and com-plete. However, the facts extracted by an IE sys-tem are always quite noisy and incomplete. Conse-quently, a purely logical approach to learning and in-ference is unlikely to be effective. Consequently, we propose using statistical relational learning (SRL) (Getoor and Taskar, 2007), specifically, Bayesian Logic Programs (BLPs) (Kersting and De Raedt, 2007), to learn probabilistic rules in first-order logic from a large corpus of extracted facts and then use the resulting BLP to make effective probabilistic in-ferences when interpreting new documents.

We have implemented this approach by using an off-the-shelf IE system and developing novel adap-tations of existing learning methods to efficiently construct fast and effective BLPs for  X  X eading be-tween the lines. X  We present an experimental evalu-ation of our resulting system on a realistic test cor-pus from DARPA X  X  Machine Reading project, and demonstrate improved performance compared to a purely logical approach based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) (Lavra  X  c and D  X  zeroski, 1994), and an alternative SRL approach based on Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) (Domingos and Lowd, 2009).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that employs BLPs for inferring implicit information from natural language text. We demonstrate that it is possible to learn the structure and the parameters of BLPs automatically using only noisy extractions from natural language text, which we then use to in-fer additional facts from text.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-tion 2 discusses related work and highlights key dif-ferences between our approach and existing work. Section 3 provides a brief background on BLPs. Section 4 describes our BLP-based approach to learning to infer implicit facts. Section 5 describes our experimental methodology and discusses the re-sults of our evaluation. Finally, Section 6 discusses potential future work and Section 7 presents our fi-nal conclusions. Several previous projects (Nahm and Mooney, 2000; Carlson et al., 2010; Schoenmackers et al., 2010; Doppa et al., 2010; Sorower et al., 2011) have mined inference rules from data automatically extracted from text by an IE system. Similar to our approach, these systems use the learned rules to infer addi-tional information from facts directly extracted from a document. Nahm and Mooney (2000) learn propo-sitional rules using C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) from data extracted from computer-related job-postings, and therefore cannot learn multi-relational rules with quantified variables. Other systems (Carlson et al., 2010; Schoenmackers et al., 2010; Doppa et al., 2010; Sorower et al., 2011) learn first-order rules (i.e. Horn clauses in first-order logic).

Carlson et al. (2010) modify an ILP system simi-lar to F OIL (Quinlan, 1990) to learn rules with prob-abilistic conclusions. They use purely logical de-duction (forward-chaining) to infer additional facts. Unlike BLPs, this approach does not use a well-founded probabilistic graphical model to compute coherent probabilities for inferred facts. Further, Carlson et al. (2010) used a human judge to man-ually evaluate the quality of the learned rules before using them to infer additional facts. Our approach, on the other hand, is completely automated and learns fully parameterized rules in a well-defined probabilistic logic.

Schoenmackers et al. (2010) develop a system called S HERLOCK that uses statistical relevance to learn first-order rules. Unlike our system and others (Carlson et al., 2010; Doppa et al., 2010; Sorower et al., 2011) that use a pre-defined ontology, they auto-matically identify a set of entity types and relations using  X  X pen IE. X  They use H OLMES (Schoenmack-ers et al., 2008), an inference engine based on MLNs (Domingos and Lowd, 2009) (an SRL approach that combines first-order logic and Markov networks) to infer additional facts. However, MLNs include all possible type-consistent groundings of the rules in the corresponding Markov net, which, for larger datasets, can result in an intractably large graphical model. To overcome this problem, H OLMES uses a specialized model construction process to control the grounding process. Unlike MLNs, BLPs natu-rally employ a more  X  X ocused X  approach to ground-ing by including only those literals that are directly relevant to the query.
 Doppa et al. (2010) use F ARMER (Nijssen and Kok, 2003), an existing ILP system, to learn first-order rules. They propose several approaches to score the rules, which are used to infer additional facts using purely logical deduction. Sorower et al. (2011) propose a probabilistic approach to modeling implicit information as missing facts and use MLNs to infer these missing facts. They learn first-order rules for the MLN by performing exhaustive search. As mentioned earlier, inference using both these ap-proaches, logical deduction and MLNs, have certain limitations, which BLPs help overcome.

DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and RESOLVER (Yates and Etzioni, 2007) learn inference rules, also called entailment rules that capture synonymous re-lations and entities from text. Berant et al. (Berant et al., 2011) propose an approach that uses transitiv-ity constraints for learning entailment rules for typed predicates. Unlike the systems described above, these systems do not learn complex first-order rules that capture common sense knowledge. Further, most of these systems do not use extractions from an IE system to learn entailment rules, thereby mak-ing them less related to our approach. Bayesian logic programs (BLPs) (Kersting and De Raedt, 2007; Kersting and Raedt, 2008) can be con-sidered as templates for constructing directed graph-ical models (Bayes nets). Formally, a BLP con-sists of a set of Bayesian clauses , definite clauses of the form a | a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , .....a n , where n  X  0 and a , a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ,......, a n are Bayesian predicates (de-fined below), and where a is called the head of the clause (head( c )) and ( a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ,...., a body (body( c )). When n = 0 , a Bayesian clause is a fact. Each Bayesian clause c is assumed to be universally quantified and range restricted, i.e variables { head }  X  variables { body } , and has an associated conditional probability table CPT( c ) = P(head( c ) | body( c )). A Bayesian predicate is a pred-icate with a finite domain, and each ground atom for a Bayesian predicate represents a random variable. Associated with each Bayesian predicate is a com-bining rule such as noisy-or or noisy-and that maps a finite set of CPTs into a single CPT.

Given a knowledge base as a BLP, standard logi-cal inference (SLD resolution) is used to automat-ically construct a Bayes net for a given problem. More specifically, given a set of facts and a query, all possible Horn-clause proofs of the query are con-structed and used to build a Bayes net for answering the query. The probability of a joint assignment of truth values to the final set of ground propositions is defined as follows: where X = X 1 , X 2 , ..., X n represents the set of random variables in the network and P a ( X i ) rep-resents the parents of X i . Once a ground network is constructed, standard probabilistic inference meth-ods can be used to answer various types of queries as reviewed by Koller and Friedman (2009). The parameters in the BLP model can be learned using the methods described by Kersting and De Raedt (2008). 4.1 Learning Rules from Extracted Data The first step involves learning commonsense knowledge in the form of first-order Horn rules from text. We first extract facts that are explicitly stated in the text using S IRE (Florian et al., 2004), an IE system developed by IBM. We then learn first-order rules from these extracted facts using L IME (Mc-creath and Sharma, 1998), an ILP system designed for noisy training data.

We first identify a set of target relations we want to infer. Typically, an ILP system takes a set of positive and negative instances for a target relation, along with a background knowledge base (in our case, other facts extracted from the same document) from which the positive instances are potentially in-ferable. In our task, we only have direct access to positive instances of target relations, i.e the relevant facts extracted from the text. So we artificially gen-erate negative instances using the closed world as-sumption , which states that any instance of a rela-tion that is not extracted can be considered a nega-tive instance. While there are exceptions to this as-sumption, it typically generates a useful (if noisy) set of negative instances. For each relation, we gen-erate all possible type-consistent instances using all constants in the domain. All instances that are not extracted facts (i.e. positive instances) are labeled as negative. The total number of such closed-world negatives can be intractably large, so we randomly sample a fixed-size subset. The ratio of 1:20 for positive to negative instances worked well in our ap-proach.

Since L IME can learn rules using only positive in-stances, or both positive and negative instances, we learn rules using both settings. We include all unique rules learned from both settings in the final set, since the goal of this step is to learn a large set of po-tentially useful rules whose relative strengths will be determined in the next step of parameter learn-ing. Other approaches could also be used to learn candidate rules. We initially tried using the popular A
LEPH ILP system (Srinivasan, 2001), but it did not produce useful rules, probably due to the high level of noise in our training data. 4.2 Learning BLP Parameters The parameters of a BLP include the CPT entries as-sociated with the Bayesian clauses and the parame-ters of combining rules associated with the Bayesian predicates. For simplicity, we use a deterministic logical-and model to encode the CPT entries associ-ated with Bayesian clauses, and use noisy-or to com-bine evidence coming from multiple ground rules that have the same head (Pearl, 1988). The noisy-or model requires just a single parameter for each rule, which can be learned from training data.
We learn the noisy-or parameters using the EM algorithm adapted for BLPs by Kersting and De Raedt (2008). In our task, the supervised training data consists of facts that are extracted from the natural language text. However, we usually do not have evidence for inferred facts as well as noisy-or nodes. As a result, there are a number of variables in the ground networks which are always hidden, and hence EM is appropriate for learning the requisite parameters from the partially observed training data. 4.3 Inference of Additional Facts using BLPs Inference in the BLP framework involves backward chaining (Russell and Norvig, 2003) from a spec-ified query (SLD resolution) to obtain all possi-ble deductive proofs for the query. In our context, each target relation becomes a query on which we backchain. We then construct a ground Bayesian network using the resulting deductive proofs for all target relations and learned parameters using the standard approach described in Section 3. Fi-nally, we perform standard probabilistic inference to estimate the marginal probability of each inferred fact. Our system uses Sample Search (Gogate and Dechter, 2007), an approximate sampling algorithm developed for Bayesian networks with determinis-tic constraints (0 values in CPTs). We tried several exact and approximate inference algorithms on our data, and this was the method that was both tractable and produced the best results. 5.1 Data For evaluation, we used DARPA X  X  machine-reading intelligence-community (IC) data set, which con-sists of news articles on terrorist events around the world. There are 10 , 000 documents each contain-ing an average of 89 . 5 facts extracted by S IRE (Flo-rian et al., 2004). S IRE assigns each extracted fact a confidence score and we used only those with a score of 0 . 5 or higher for learning and inference. An average of 86 . 8 extractions per document meet this threshold.

DARPA also provides an ontology describing the entities and relations in the IC domain. It con-sists of 57 entity types and 79 relations. The entity types include Agent, PhysicalThing, Event, TimeLocation, Gender, and Group, each with sev-eral subtypes. The type hierarchy is a DAG rather than a tree, and several types have multiple super-classes. For instance, a GeopoliticalEntity can be a HumanAgent as well as a Location. This can cause some problems for systems that rely on a strict typing system, such as MLNs which rely on types to limit the space of ground literals that are considered. Some sample relations are attended-School, approximateNumberOfMembers, mediatin-gAgent, employs, hasMember, hasMemberHuman-Agent, and hasBirthPlace. 5.2 Methodology We evaluated our approach using 10-fold cross vali-dation. We learned first-order rules for the 13 tar-get relations shown in Table 3 from the facts ex-tracted from the training documents (Section 4.1). These relations were selected because the extrac-tor X  X  recall for them was low. Since L IME does not scale well to large data sets, we could train it on at most about 2 , 500 documents. Consequently, we split the 9 , 000 training documents into four disjoint subsets and learned first-order rules from each sub-set. The final knowledge base included all unique rules learned from any subset. L IME learned sev-eral rules that had only entity types in their bodies. Such rules make many incorrect inferences; hence we eliminated them. We also eliminated rules vio-lating type constraints. We learned an average of 48 rules per fold. Table 1 shows some sample learned rules.

We then learned parameters as described in Sec-tion 4.2. We initially set all noisy-or parameters to 0 . 9 based on the intuition that if exactly one rule for a consequent was satisfied, it could be inferred with a probability of 0 . 9 .
For each test document, we performed BLP in-ference as described in Section 4.3. We ranked all inferences by their marginal probability, and evalu-ated the results by either choosing the top n infer-ences or accepting inferences whose marginal prob-ability was equal to or exceeded a specified thresh-old. We evaluated two BLPs with different param-eter settings: BLP-Learned-Weights used noisy-or parameters learned using EM, BLP-Manual-Weights used fixed noisy-or weights of 0 . 9 . 5.3 Evaluation Metrics The lack of ground truth annotation for inferred facts prevents an automated evaluation, so we resorted to a manual evaluation. We randomly sampled 40 documents ( 4 from each test fold), judged the ac-curacy of the inferences for those documents, and computed precision , the fraction of inferences that were deemed correct. For probabilistic methods like BLPs and MLNs that provide certainties for their inferences, we also computed precision at top n , which measures the precision of the n inferences with the highest marginal probability across the 40 test documents. Measuring recall for making infer-ences is very difficult since it would require labeling a reasonable-sized corpus of documents with all of the correct inferences for a given set of target rela-tions, which would be extremely time consuming. Our evaluation is similar to that used in previous re-lated work (Carlson et al., 2010; Schoenmackers et al., 2010).

S IRE frequently makes incorrect extractions, and therefore inferences made from these extractions are also inaccurate. To account for the mistakes made by the extractor, we report two different precision scores. The  X  X nadjusted X  (UA) score, does not cor-rect for errors made by the extractor. The  X  X djusted X  (AD) score does not count mistakes due to extraction errors. That is, if an inference is incorrect because it was based on incorrect extracted facts, we remove it from the set of inferences and calculate precision for the remaining inferences. 5.4 Baselines Since none of the existing approaches have been evaluated on the IC data, we cannot directly compare our performance to theirs. Therefore, we compared to the following methods:  X  Logical Deduction : This method forward  X  Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) : We use the 6.1 Comparison to Baselines Table 2 gives the unadjusted (UA) and adjusted (AD) precision for logical deduction. Out of 1 , 490 inferences for the 40 evaluation documents, 443 were judged correct, giving an unadjusted preci-sion of 29.73%. Out of these 1 , 490 inferences, 233 were determined to be incorrect due to extraction er-rors, improving the adjusted precision to a modest 35 . 24% .

MLNs made about 127 , 000 inferences for the 40 evaluation documents. Since it is not feasible to manually evaluate all the inferences made by the MLN, we calculated precision using only the top 1000 inferences. Figure 1 shows both unadjusted and adjusted precision at top-n for various values of n for different BLP and MLN models. For both BLPs and MLNs, simple manual weights result in superior performance than the learned weights. De-spite the fairly large size of the overall training sets (9,000 documents), the amount of data for each target relation is apparently still not sufficient to learn particularly accurate weights for both BLPs and MLNs. However, for BLPs, learned weights do show a substantial improvement initially (i.e. top 25 X 50 inferences), with an average of 1 infer-ence per document at 91% adjusted precision as opposed to an average of 5 inferences per docu-ment at 85% adjusted precision for BLP-Manual-Weights. For MLNs, learned weights show a small improvement initially only with respect to adjusted precision. Between BLPs and MLNs, BLPs per-form substantially better than MLNs at most points in the curve. However, MLN-Manual-Weights im-prove marginally over BLP-Learned-Weights at later points (top 600 and above) on the curve, where the precision is generally very low. Here, the superior performance of BLPs over MLNs could be possibly due to the focused grounding used in the BLP frame-work.

For BLPs, as n increases towards including all of the logically sanctioned inferences, as expected, the precision converges to the results for logical deduc-tion. However, as n decreases, both adjusted and unadjusted precision increase fairly steadily. This demonstrates that probabilistic BLP inference pro-vides a clear improvement over logical deduction, allowing the system to accurately select the best in-ferences that are most likely to be correct. Unlike the two BLP models, MLN-Manual-Weights has more or less the same performance at most points on the curve, and it is slightly better than that of purely-logical deduction. MLN-Learned-Weights is worse than purely-logical deduction at most points on the curve. 6.2 Results for Individual Target Relations Table 3 shows the adjusted precision for each relation for instances inferred using logical de-duction, BLP-Manual-Weights and BLP-Learned-Weights with a confidence threshold of 0 . 95 . The probabilities estimated for inferences by MLNs are not directly comparable to those estimated by BLPs. As a result, we do not include results for MLNs here. For this evaluation, using a confidence thresh-old based cutoff is more appropriate than using top-n inferences made by the BLP models since the esti-mated probabilities can be directly compared across target relations.

For logical deduction, precision is high for a few relations like employs, hasMember, and hasMem-berHumanAgent, indicating that the rules learned for these relations are more accurate than the ones learned for the remaining relations. Unlike rela-tions like hasMember that are easily inferred from relations like employs and isLedBy, certain relations like hasBirthPlace are not easily inferable using the information in the ontology. As a result, it might not be possible to learn accurate rules for such tar-get relations. Other reasons include the lack of a sufficiently large number of target-relation instances during training and lack of strictly defined types in the IC ontology.
 Both BLP-Manual-Weights and BLP-Learned-Weights also have high precision for several re-lations (eventLocation, hasMemberHumanAgent, thingPhysicallyDamaged). However, the actual number of inferences can be fairly low. For in-stance, 103 instances of hasMemberHumanAgent are inferred by logical deduction (i.e. 0 confidence threshold), but only 2 of them are inferred by BLP-Learned-Weights at 0 . 95 confidence threshold, in-dicating that the parameters learned for the corre-sponding rules are not very high. For several rela-tions like hasMember, hasMemberPerson, and em-ploys, no instances were inferred by BLP-Learned-Weights at 0 . 95 confidence threshold. Lack of suffi-cient training instances (extracted facts) is possibly the reason for learning low weights for such rules. On the other hand, BLP-Manual-Weights has in-ferred 26 instances of hasMemberHumanAgent, out which all are correct. These results therefore demon-strate the need for sufficient training examples to learn accurate parameters. 6.3 Discussion We now discuss the potential reasons for BLP X  X  su-perior performance compared to other approaches. Probabilistic reasoning used in BLPs allows for a principled way of determining the most confident inferences, thereby allowing for improved precision over purely logical deduction. The primary dif-ference between BLPs and MLNs lies in the ap-proaches used to construct the ground network. In BLPs, only propositions that can be logically de-duced from the extracted evidence are included in the ground network. On the other hand, MLNs in-clude all possible type-consistent groundings of all rules in the network, introducing many ground liter-als which cannot be logically deduced from the ev-idence. This generally results in several incorrect inferences, thereby yielding poor performance.
Even though learned weights in BLPs do not re-sult in a superior performance, learned weights in MLNs are substantially worse. Lack of sufficient training data is one of the reasons for learning less accurate weights by the MLN weight learner. How-ever, a more important issue is due to the use of the closed world assumption during learning, which we believe is adversely impacting the weights learned. As mentioned earlier, for the task considered in the paper, if a fact is not explicitly stated in text, and hence not extracted by the extractor, it does not nec-essarily imply that it is not true. Since existing weight learning approaches for MLNs do not deal with missing data and open world assumption, de-veloping such approaches is a topic for future work.
Apart from developing novel approaches for weight learning, additional engineering could poten-tially improve the performance of MLNs on the IC data set. Due to MLN X  X  grounding process, sev-eral spurious facts like employs(a,a) were inferred. These inferences can be prevented by including ad-ditional clauses in the MLN that impose integrity constraints that prevent such nonsensical proposi-tions. Further, techniques proposed by Sorower et al. (2011) can be incorporated to explicitly han-dle missing information in text. Lack of strict typ-ing on the arguments of relations in the IC ontol-ogy has also resulted in inferior performance of the MLNs. To overcome this, relations that do not have strictly defined types could be specialized. Finally, we could use the deductive proofs constructed by BLPs to constrain the ground Markov network, sim-ilar to the model-construction approach adopted by Singla and Mooney (2011).

However, in contrast to MLNs, BLPs that use first-order rules that are learned by an off-the-shelf ILP system and given simple intuitive hand-coded weights, are able to provide fairly high-precision in-ferences that augment the output of an IE system and allow it to effectively  X  X ead between the lines. X  A primary goal for future research is developing an on-line structure learner for BLPs that can directly learn probabilistic first-order rules from uncertain training data. This will address important limita-tions of L IME , which cannot accept uncertainty in the extractions used for training, is not specifically optimized for learning rules for BLPs, and does not scale well to large datasets. Given the relatively poor performance of BLP parameters learned using EM, tests on larger training corpora of extracted facts and the development of improved parameter-learning al-gorithms are clearly indicated. We also plan to per-form a larger-scale evaluation by employing crowd-sourcing to evaluate inferred facts for a bigger cor-pus of test documents. As described above, a num-ber of methods could be used to improve the per-formance of MLNs on this task. Finally, it would be useful to evaluate our methods on several other diverse domains. We have introduced a novel approach using Bayesian Logic Programs to learn to infer implicit information from facts extracted from natural lan-guage text. We have demonstrated that it can learn effective rules from a large database of noisy extrac-tions. Our experimental evaluation on the IC data set demonstrates the advantage of BLPs over logical deduction and an approach based on MLNs.
