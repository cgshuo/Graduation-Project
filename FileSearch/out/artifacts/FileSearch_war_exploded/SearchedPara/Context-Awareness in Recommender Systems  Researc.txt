 CARS and CAMRa were organized under the Context-awareness in Recommendation Systems special event and gathered academic researchers as well as industrial practi-tioners in a workshop and challenge.

The importance of contextual information has been recog-nized by researchers and practitioners in many disciplines, including personalization, information retrieval, ubiquitous and mobile computing, data mining, and management. While a substantial research has already been performed in the area of recommender systems, the vast majority of exist-ing approaches focuses on recommending the most relevant items to users and does not consider additional contextual information, such as time, location, weather, or the company of other users. This joint workshop and challenge brought together researchers with wide-ranging backgrounds to iden-tify important research questions, to exchange ideas from different research disciplines, and to facilitate discussion and innovation in the area of context-aware recommender sys-tems in general (CARS 1 ) and tackle practical challenges of context-aware movie recommendation (CAMRa 2 ). http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/cars2010/ http://www.dai-labor.de/camra2010/
The CARS area has experienced significant growth over the last few years after several papers have been published on the subject. The goal of the 2nd CARS workshop is two-fold: (1) to bring together the leading CARS researchers in order to discuss the key issues and problems of incorporating and utilizing contextual information in recommender sys-tems, and (2) to move the CARS area forward by overview-ing various existing approaches, identifying key themes, and developing new directions. Some of the CARS-related is-sues included the development of novel context modeling and user modeling techniques, algorithms for detecting rel-evance of contextual data and for incorporating contextual information into the recommendation methods, and how to scale these methods to large volumes of data and to rich and numerous classes of contextual information. The goal of the workshop was accomplished through presentation of peer-reviewed technical papers, a research keynote, and having a panel-style discussion of the key issues by the workshop participants.
CAMRa was set up as a challenge to give industrial and academic representatives working in recommender systems an opportunity to focus their efforts on a common goal. The challenge focused on two datasets (released exclusively for the challenge by Movepilot and Filmtipset movie recommen-dation websites) and three context-aware recommendation tasks (event-, mood-, and social-based recommendations) that the participants were asked to address. In this en-vironment we were able to identify important aspects in context-aware recommendation, compare developed meth-ods and obtained results.
 The challenge attracted over 40 teams from 21 countries. The primary outcomes of the challenge were presented in the papers accepted to the workshop. The proceedings are available in the ACM International Conference Proceeding Series. Extended versions of the best papers will be pub-lished in a special issue of the ACM Transaction on Intelli-gent Systems and Technology (TIST).
