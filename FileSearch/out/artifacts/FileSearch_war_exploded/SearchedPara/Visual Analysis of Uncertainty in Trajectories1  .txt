 In recent years, there has been a dramatic in crease in GPS-embedded devices used for navigation and tracking, which enables the collection of large volumes of GPS trajecto-ries [8]. Trajectory data play important roles in urban planning, route recommendation, traffic analysis, and transpor tation management. Usually, tra jectories are presented in two styles: curves (parameterized by time) in a 2D plane or trajectory samples that are discrete spatial-temporal points. The latter style is widely adopted in trajectory datasets since the cost of capturing and maintaining data is relatively low. However, the tra-jectories represented by samples often involve uncertainty which might appear as data imprecision due to sampling/measurement e rrors or fuzziness caused by pre-processing for preserving anonymity. Uncertainty in trajectories poses challenges for enhancing, reconstructing, and mining trajectories.

Uncertainty that appears a s measurement errors has been studied for enhancing his-torical trajectories [9]. Limited by the technology used, the trajectory data are not pre-cise due to measurement and sampling errors. Therefore, the recorded GPS positions often need to be matched with the given road network (referred to as road map). This process is called map-matching . Map-matching is integrated in many trajectory-based applications as a pre-processing module, which aligns trajectory samples with the given road networks. Quddus et al. [14] summarized the existin g map-matching approaches
