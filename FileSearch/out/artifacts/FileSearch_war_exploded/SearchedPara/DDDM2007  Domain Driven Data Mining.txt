 Real-world data mining generally must consider and in-volve domain and business oriented factors such as human knowledge, constraints and business expectations. This en -courages the development of a domain driven methodology to strengthen data-centered pattern mining. This report presents a review of the ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Do-main Driven Data Mining (DDDM2007), held in conjunction with the Thirteenth ACM SIGKDD International Confer-ence on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD07), which was held in San Jose, USA on 12 August, 2007. The aims and objectives of this workshop were to provide a pre-mier forum for sharing innovative findings, knowledge, in-sights, experiences and lessons in tackling challenges met in domain driven, actionable knowledge discovery in the real world.
In the last decade data mining has emerged as one of the most vivacious areas in information technology. Classi c data mining is heavily dependent on data itself, and relies on data-centered methodologies. Existing approaches eith er view data mining as an autonomous data-driven trial-and-error process, or analyze business issues in an isolated and case-by-case manner. As a result, very often the knowledge discovered does not always generally satisfy real business needs.

As pointed out by SIGKDD panelists [5, 10] and recent re-search [8, 1, 11], actionable knowledge discovery is one of t he grand challenges for the next generation of KDD research and development. There is at present a lack of method-ologies, techniques, and applications which can effectivel y bridge the gap between academia and business [6]. We need to address business interestingness [9, 12] and successful ly deliver knowledge [4] and patterns that are operationalisa ble and dependable. Domain driven data mining targets such challenges and objectives.

A high level of domain driven data mining framework has been discussed in [2, 3]. Domain driven, actionable knowledge discovery should involve, support and integrate the following intelligence and constraints: domain expert  X  X  role and computational capability, domain knowledge and intelligence, network and web intelligence, in-depth data intelligence, and the constrained environment and deliver -ables in specific domains. This naturally involves many gen-eral issues in domain driven data mining, including human-cooperated or centered [7] data mining and computing, the involvement and representation of domain knowledge and intelligence, the involvement and development of web and network mining and intelligence, processing mixed data and multi-data sources, in-depth data mining, constraint min-ing [7], business interestingness, combining technical si gnif-icance with business expectations, actions in decision sup -port, as well as issues of privacy, security, trust, dependa bil-ity, and workability.

Certainly, it is a non-trivial effort to narrow gap between technical outputs and business expectations. It is promis-ing but challenging to promote the paradigm shift from  X  X ata-centered pattern mining X  to  X  X omain-driven action-able knowledge discovery. X  A broad attention and effort in the research community, active interaction and collabora-tion between academia and industry, and innovation in data mining education are expected to contribute toward these goals. This report of the  X 2007 ACM SIGKDD International Workshop on Domain Driven Data Mining (DDDM2007) X  summarizes one of the lines of effort addressing this field.
DDDM2007 has provided a premier forum for sharing findings, knowledge, insight, experience and lessons by:
The DDDM2007 is organized by the Faculty of Informa-tion Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, Aus-tralia. The half-day workshop has competitively selected eight papers from five countries. These papers have ad-dressed specific domain problems in crime, social security, blog, business, healthcare, finance, as well as theoretical is-sues. A common feature of contributed papers was that spe-cific data mining techniques and approaches were developed and tested in specific domain problems. In the following, we briefly discuss each contribution.

The workshop started with crime detection for credit ap-plications. In  X  X daptive Communal Detection in Search of Adversarial Identity Crime X , Clifton Phua, Vincent Lee, Kate Smith-Miles and Ross Gayler present an updated adap-tive Communal Analysis Suspicion Scoring (CASS) algo-rithm. At pre-defined time intervals and by measuring cur-rent input size and previous output suspiciousness, CASS adaptively changes the appropriate parameter setting to trade off efficiency/speed and effectiveness/security. Their approach is validated with three sets of experiments on real credit applications.

A domain ontology can contribute to attribute selection and in the interpretation of mining results to make data min-ing better aligned with business understanding. In  X  X omain Ontology Driven Data Mining: A Medical Case Study X , Yen-Ting Kuo, Andrew Lonie, Liz Sonenberg and Kathy Paizis explore the possibility of utilizing a medical domai n ontology to categorize attributes for association rule min ing Mined rules were reviewed by comparison to domain knowl-edge derived from a domain expert. It is claimed to deliver more meaningful results.

Effective and integrative use of patterns in distributed data sources may disclose combinational patterns that are informative and useful for business needs. In their work  X  X ining for Combined Association Rules on Multi-ple Datasets X , Yanchang Zhao, Huaifeng Zhang, Fernando Figueiredo, Longbing Cao and Chengqi Zhang propose a new association rule method, named Combined Association Rules. It first extracts patterns in transactional data and specifies class labels with domain expert supervision. Then demographic patterns are attached to these patterns. The method was tested on real-world social security data for gov -ernmental debt recovery.

Steganalysis methods are proposed for detecting hidden information. A general steganalysis framework is investi-gated by Shen Ge, Yang Gao and Ruili Wang in  X  X east Sig-nificant Bit Steganography Detection with Machine Learn-ing Techniques X . It applies machine learning to detecting Least Significant Bit steganography hidden information in image data. Features derived from conventional methods are extracted, and then varying classifier methods based on them for detecting hidden information. They show better steganalysis with more effective classifier methods.
Identifying leading indicators is not easy, but critical fo r implementing business intelligence. This is addressed in  X  A Semi-automatic System with an Iterative Learning Method for Discovering the Leading Indicators in Business Pro-cesses X . The co-authors Wei Peng, Tong Sun, Philip Rose and Tao Li propose a semi-automatic system and methods to iteratively discover leading indicators from real-time wo rk-flow events, equipment logs, and other metrics sources. The method utilizes domain knowledge to filter indicators, and enables incremental adjustment of underlying domain model through involving domain knowledge.

Customer and firm-specific information plays an impor-tant role in improving prediction accuracy. This is evidenc ed by Sai Zeng, Prem Melville, Christian A. Lang, Ioana Boier-Martin and Conrad Murphy in their paper  X  X redictive Mod-eling for Collections of Accounts Receivable X . They use a supervised learning method to build models for predicting the payment outcomes of newly created invoices, thus en-abling customized collection actions tailored for each inv oice or customer. They illustrate the application in several firm s.
The involvement of expert and business knowledge is es-sential in discovering new knowledge valuable for  X  X mart X  data mining algorithms. Based on real-life experience in en -terprise data mining, in  X  X oward Knowledge-Driven Data Mining X , Warwick Graco, Tatiana Semenova and Eugene Dubossarsky summarize a number of issues that may en-hance the effectiveness of data mining if solved. They stress the necessary involvement of tools and techniques, expert knowledge, smart data, business knowledge and intelligenc e towards knowledge driven data mining.

Last but not least, blog-specific search and mining tech-niques are emerging. In  X  X log Search and Mining in the Business Domain X , Latent Semantic Analysis and Proba-bilistic Latent Semantic Analysis based probabilistic mod -els are investigated for searching and mining business blog s. Various term weighting schemes and factor values are used for similarity search. Yun Chen, Flora S.Tsai, and Kap Luk Chan claim that domain driven data mining can better strengthen business intelligence in complex enterprise ap pli-cations.

We hope the above contributions can promote the research and development of discovering actionable knowledge from complex domain problems, enhancing interaction and reduc-ing the gap between academia and business, and driving a paradigm shift from interesting hidden pattern mining to actionable knowledge discovery in varying data mining do-mains. In this paper, we present a brief review of the ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Domain Driven Data Mining (DDDM2007). DDDM2007 has brought together the re-searchers and experienced data miners in the real world who are interested in developing innovative methodologies, ap -proaches, and enterprise applications for workable, depen d-able, and actionable knowledge discovery in the real life. A t-tendees have clearly realized the need for domain driven dat a mining, and informed of the promising efforts in developing corresponding techniques and applications. We hope such efforts can be encouraged and maintained through other pro-fessional activities in the community and industries.
