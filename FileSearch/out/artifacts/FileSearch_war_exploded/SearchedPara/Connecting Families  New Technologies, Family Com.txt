 H.5 INFORMATION INTERFACES AND PRESENTATION (I.7): H.5.3 Group and Organization Interfaces; Computer-supported cooperative work Families, communication, home, synchronous, asynchronous Computer-mediated communication (CMC) has been a longstanding focus of study in the fields of HCI and CSCW dating back to the first incarnations of the media space in the early 1980s [4]. Since then, this research sphere has explored teleconferencing to email and instant messaging. The early focus of this work was largely workplace-oriented where researchers focused on improving and understanding workplace communication practices. However, over the last decade, there has been an increasing focus on studying computer-mediated communication in the home. In the domestic realm, the goal of computer-mediated communication research is to understand the communication practices of families both within and extending outside of the home as family members seek to communicate, coordinate, and connect with their loved ones and friends. Our focus is on technologies that allow family members to directly connect with one another either synchronously (e.g., video conferencing) or asynchronously (e.g., instant messaging), as opposed to technologies where one broadcasts or shares information with many (e.g., social networking sites). Here research typically aims to support communication between parents, children, grandparents, and close friends. As examples, research in this space has spanned many areas of study including the role of locations within the home [3], distributed-family communication [2 ,5], organizing systems [16], family awareness [13], video conferencing practices [1,7,9], and mobile media [12]. Similarly, it has seen the design of many new technologies to support family rou tines, such as Digital Family Portraits [11], the Remote Presence Lamp [17], VideoProbe [6], Home Note [14], and the Family Window [8]. Computer-mediated communicati on for the home has also now moved out of the research lab and into actual everyday practice. Computing technologies are rapidly changing the way families can communicate, coordinate, and connect with others through readily-available (and often free) applications, such as Google Talk, Skype, or iChat. The accessibility and proliferation of these applications means that family members are increasingly faced with new mechanisms to reach out and connect with their family and friends. For this reason, technology is now rapidly reconfiguring the way we thi nk about and design for domestic spaces. As it does so, researchers now must directly confront issues of family relations and the subtle negotiations that are part of that realm.  X  X onnection X  can be emotionally expressive or merely informational. Analytic frameworks as well as technologies developed to support work may not be appropriate for understanding this setting. The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers, designers, and practitioners who study family practices or domestic technology design with a particular emphasis on mediating family communicati on within the home and also between homes. We want to bu ild community around this topical area, explore the themes of this research over the last decade, and discuss the relevant research themes of the next decade. We also wish to discuss possibilities for a follow-on special journal issue or book on the topic. Intended workshop participants include academics, industrial researchers, designers, software developers and other practitioners who actively work in the area of computer-mediated communication in the domestic real m. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to: -family coordination -family communication -video communication -communication across time zones -social relations in families -analytic frameworks for ICT in the domestic realm -domestic awareness appliances We also seek participation by representatives from the major industrial players in this space, including Nokia, Google, Skype, Microsoft, Apple, Cisco, etc. Workshop participants will be selected based on refereed submissions. We will solicit 2-4 page position papers (CHI extended abstract format) and expect to accept 15-20 participants. Authors will be asked to direct th eir paper at describing their area communication along with the future direction they see research in this space taking. We also ask that authors include short biographies for each of the position paper X  X  authors. We expect workshop, though we may be able to accommodate a small number of special requests. The workshop will be a full day with the following tentative workshop schedule: Introduction: Workshop organizers will introduce themselves and present the workshop goals a nd schedules to attendees. Morning Session: A selection of attendees will provide 8-10 minute presentations of their re search or design work. We will select presenters who will provide a broad range of application areas, methodologies, and perspectiv es. These pres entations will foster discussion points for synthesi s discussions later in the day. Early Afternoon Session: Attendees will break into subgroups to discuss and identify the primary themes of research in domestic computer-mediated communication over the last decade. They will also identify the research tr ajectories of importance for the next decade. This session may be accompanied by some brainstorming and/or analysis activities such as affinity diagramming. Late Afternoon Session: Attendees will come together and the organizers will lead a discussion around the themes that were identified in the preceding discussions. They will also discuss possibilities for a follow-on special journal issue or edited book. We will require a digital projector, power strips and associated electricity, and Internet connectivity.

His main research interests are in human-computer interaction and design with special interests in computer-supported cooperative work, ubiquitous computing, and domestic computing. In these areas, he seeks to understand the socio-technical factors of ubiquitous technology design to support the everyday social practices of individuals and groups . Many of Carman X  X  projects have focused on designing for fa milies, including studies of domestic media spaces, digital and print photos, family calendars, and family communication informa tion. Carman previously co-organized a Designing for Families workshop at CSCW 2008, a follow-up SIG at CHI 2009, and a workshop at CHI 2010 on transitioning between requireme nts analysis and design. Tejinder Judge, Virginia Tech Tejinder Judge is a PhD candida te in the Center for Human-Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech. Her research interests are in human-computer interacti on with a focus on domestic computing, computer mediat ed communication, computer-supported collaborative work, de sign, and design methodologies. Her dissertation research focuses on understanding the implications of domestic media spaces on communication, connectedness and awareness be tween families separated by distance. Tejinder is involved in ongoing projects that include designing collaborative tools fo r designers and developing a methodology to aid designers in transitioning from contextual analysis, to the design of a new system. She co-organized a workshop at CHI 2010 on the transition between contextual analysis and design. Steve Harrison, Virginia Tech Prior to joining Virginia Tech, he was at Xerox PARC where he developed the first media space. That work focused on collaborative work but was driven out of an interest in the social aspects of space and place. He has recently edited the book, Media Space: Twenty+ Years of Mediated Life, which brings together many of its key ideas. His current work extends those research interests to the domestic realm. Mr. Harrison was the CHI 2006 Workshop Chair and has been an organizer of workshops at CSCW (which resulted in the Media Space book) and at CHI.
