 1. Introduction With the rapid development of Internet, information on the Internet is increasing exponentially ( Gray, 1996 ).
Finding useful information from this huge and mixed depository has been a challenge to the traditional infor-mation retrieval technology, and great interest and substantial investment have focused on it. Search engine
You may often get irrelevant hits when query a general-purpose search engine for specific information about chemical web pages to improve the performance of chemistry-focused search engine, which attempts to help chemists to find information more conveniently and precisely on Internet. Dumais, Cutrell, and Chen (2001) grating the corresponding category information with the web search results can be a substantial approach to statistical classification and machine learning techniques have been applied to this problem, including Rocchio machines (SVMs) ( Joachims, 1998 ), and neutral networks ( Wiener, Pedersen, &amp; Weigend, 1995 ). In general, much research has been done on comparing the performance of different text categorization techniques using several datasets ( Aas &amp; Eikvil, 1999; Lewis &amp; Ringuette, 1994; Yang, 1999; Yang &amp; Liu, 1999 ).
Among these popular methods, we choose the nearest neighbor classifier, for its simplicity, efficiency and robustness, to classify the chemical web pages using a hierarchical chemical categorization system.
Since text categorization performance is highly dependent on the data collections ( Yang, 1999 ) and the chemical web pages often focus on more similar topics than general-purpose documents, the classifier shows undesirable results when applied to classify these pages in our experiments. So we build a chemistry dictionary to extract the domain knowledge hidden in the chemical web pages and implement a new text categorization system based on it. We also present a voting method to get better categorization performance according to the characteristics of the data sets used.

The paper is organized as follows. An overview of text categorization techniques, such as feature extraction and text categorization method, is presented in Section 2 . Section 3 provides the detail of the chemistry dic-tionary we build, and explains the new dictionary-based text categorization system. In Section 4 , the experi-mental results are analyzed and discussed. The final section presents conclusion. 2. Text categorization techniques
This section gives an overview of conventional text categorization techniques used in this paper. 2.1. Feature extraction
Feature extraction is a technique that tries to select the informative terms from the documents to form the vector space that will be used in text retrieval. All documents including test and training ones are converted from the original format to word vectors through the following steps. 2.1.1. Preprocessing
Each word in the document except the HTML (or other) tags are extracted and the stop words are removed word stemming is performed by using the Porter stemmer ( Porter, 1980 ). 2.1.2. Indexing
To represent the documents as term vectors, term weights should be computed. A well-known approach is the TF-IDF weighting ( Salton &amp; Buckley, 1988 ). Normally weighting scheme can be presented as the global weight of the term t and N ( d ) is the normalization of document d .

According to Wang (2003) , we use the following formulas to compute the term weights to ensure the effec-tiveness of information retrieval: where tf td is the frequency of term t within document d , gf ndocs is the total document number in the data set. 2.1.3. Dimensionality reduction
Since not every document contains all terms, the feature vector space is usually very large and sparse. The high dimensionality of it is the major difficulty of text categorization. Both feature selection and re-parame-terization are performed to reduce the original feature dimensionality in this paper.

Firstly the terms that occur in only one document are removed, for these rare terms are either non-infor-mative or not influential in global performance. Then latent semantic indexing (LSI) ( Berry, Dumais, &amp; ture vector space. As a re-parameterization approach, LSI is based on the assumption that there is some underlying or latent structure in the pattern of word usage across documents, and that statistical techniques can be used to estimate this structure. LSI uses singular-value decomposition (SVD), a technique closely re-lated to eigenvector decomposition and factor analysis, to reduce the dimensionality of the input feature space and obtain some semantic relations hidden in the space. The key issue of LSI is the assignment of calculated singular values (LSI-k ), which will be discussed in Section 4.2 . 2.2. Text categorization method
As a simple approach, the k -nearest neighbor ( k -NN) algorithm has shown very good performance on text document. Though its categorization performance is not as good as that of SVMs, k -NN is easy to implement than SVMs ( Ko &amp; Seo, 2004 ). So, k -NN is used to classify chemical web pages in this paper.
To find the k most similar neighbors, we use the traditional information retrieval techniques. Based on the feature vector space, the distance (or similarity) between the query document q and a training document d is measured by the cosine value of the angle between the corresponding vectors ( Yang et al., 2002 ):
Next, find the k nearest neighbors of the query from the ranked list of the training documents, where the r ( q ) of category c for the query document q is computed by where cos( q , d i ) is the cosine similarity between query q and the neighbor d neighbor d i .

Finally, the relevant categories are assigned to the query document if the corresponding ranks r higher than a threshold value. The threshold value is also an important parameter in text categorization and will be discussed in Section 4.2 together with the LSI-k and k -NN-k . 3. Dictionary-based text categorization
The chemical web pages usually focus on more similar topics than general-purpose documents. This seman-tic similarity brings more difficulties when retrieving the k nearest neighbors by identifying the differences among the documents to rank them, which makes the text classifier perform poorly for the chemical pages.
These have motivated us to build a chemistry dictionary, which represents the chemistry-specific knowledge, to extract the domain information more exactly from chemical web pages. Then based on the dictionary, a new text categorization approach is proposed in this section. 3.1. Chemistry dictionary
We have built a machine-readable chemistry dictionary (ChemDict). The dictionary is a simple term list, combination of three electronic resources, an electronic chemistry dictionary ( Kingsoft, 2004 ), keyword terms extracted from selected chemical journals ( Cqvip.com, 2004 ) and vocabulary bank of ChIN, the
Chemical Information Network ( IPE, 2004 ). ChIN is a comprehensive chemistry resources directory and is now the chemistry portal of Chinese National Science Digital Library ( CAS, 2004 ). ChemDict is a
Chinese X  X nglish chemistry dictionary and have been further processed into three collections. In this paper, we only discuss the terms in English. Here, ChemDict-I is the original chemistry dictionary directly constructed from the sources; ChemDict-II is the dictionary removing those terms not associated with chem-istry from ChemDict-I by filtering each term with a general-purpose English dictionary; and after manually examined, ChemDict-II turns into ChemDict-III. In the dictionaries, each chemistry phrase, for example  X  X  X uel cell X  X , is considered as a term since it represents a whole and exact concept. The profiles of the three dictionaries used in our experiments can be found in Table 1 , that include the term number, phrase term number, average length and proportion of phrase terms of each dictionary. These dictionaries have differ-ent refined levels that should have influence on the categorization efficiency, which will be discussed in
Section 4.4.1 . 3.2. Dictionary-based text categorization
Since phrase terms in the dictionaries include more than one word, they need a more complicated method to identify them from text but not just separate words with white-space delimited tokens. Automatic segmenta-the task as selecting a partition on the sequence of characters that corresponds to term boundary positions. As a well-known segmentation algorithm, longest substring matching ( Levow et al., 2005 ) is adopted in this paper. In the algorithm, a sentence is traversed from left to right, matching the longest dictionary term that begins at the present position.

Fig. 1 illustrates the data flow between the key components in our dictionary-based text categorization architecture. The shadow rectangle in the figure highlights the automatic segmentation parts of the architec-ture, which makes the system different from and more effective than the conventional text categorization meth-ods. In the system, automatic segmentation is performed separately on the test and training documents to find chemical single or phrase terms, and the matched terms are added to the documents to improve semantic pre-tion as described in Section 2.1 is done to produce the final vectors. Then the information retrieval system finds the k nearest neighbors of the test document from the training vector space, and the relevant categories of the test are finally obtained based on the k -NN text categorization algorithm.
 4. Experiments
In this section, the experimental results are provided and discussed. Data sets and performance measures used in the experiments are firstly described. Next, results of baseline runs using conventional k -NN text categorization method are offered. Then, a series of dictionary-based runs are done, that include the runs to test the effect of the refined level of dictionary on the categorization performance, the runs to study the effectiveness of different dictionary term expansion strategies, and the tests to compare the efficiency of the dictionary-based runs with that of the baseline runs. Results show that the effectiveness of dictionary-based text categorization is better than that of the traditional method. Finally, a new voting method is implemented to make full use of the characteristics of the data sets and the experimental results are provided. 4.1. Date sets In our experiments, there are four data sets used to test the text categorization performance.
We used a subset of the chemical web pages indexed in ChIN, the pages that were created before July 27, 2003 by ChIN editors, to construct the first data set ChIN-URL, and their corresponding English summary pages that briefly outline the web pages were taken as another data set ChIN-SE. In addition, to investigate the effect of domain knowledge on categorization effectiveness, we also appended the chemical keywords as-signed to the summary page by ChIN editors into the corresponding summary page, and built the third data set, the English summary pages with keywords (ChIN-SEK). Each chemistry resource indexed in ChIN is manually classified into one or more categories by editors. ChIN uses a hierarchical chemical categorization schema ( NSFC, 2004 ) adopted by Natural Science Foundation of China. It is a three level hierarchical struc-ture and has total 341 categories.

To compare the efficiency of dictionary-based text categorization for chemical web pages with that for gen-eral-propose documents, the popular text categorization data set, Reuters-21578 ( Lewis, 2004 ) collection, was used as the fourth data set.

The distributions of categories in the data sets are shown in Table 2 , where ChIN data set represents all the three data sets from ChIN since they have the similar categorization information. Close observation will find that the data sets are all uneven multi-label data sets with different categorization complexity. So, we can suppose that the categorization effectiveness on ChIN data sets would not be as good as that on Reuters-21578. The results of our experiments have proven the presumption.

To split train/test data, we used the  X  X  X odApte X  X  split ( Lewis, 2004 ) to divide the Reuters collection into a training set and a test set. ChIN data sets were split according to the created dates of the documents. We also removed the documents, which had no category or no text besides the tags, from all the data sets. Table 3 shows the distributions of documents in the resulting data sets. We collected the chemical web pages in
ChIN-URL from the Internet by a real-time crawler, and many pages were not be available when crawled for the reason of the dynamic property of Internet, so the ChIN-URL data set has less documents than the
ChIN-SE and ChIN-SEK. 4.2. Performance measures and preferences
For evaluating the average performance across categories, we followed the traditional micro-averaging method ( Yang, 1999 ). It counts the decisions for all the categories in a joint pool and computes the global recall, precision and F 1 values for that global pool, where F
In our text categorization experiments, optimal values should be assigned for three parameters. The first one is LSI-k which determines the singular value of SVD decomposition in the indexing phase, the second one is k -NN-k which determines how many neighbors should be chosen to compute the ranks of categories, and the third is the threshold value which determines the final relevant categories of the unknown document. the other two parameters, the micro-average recall decreases, the precision increases and the corresponding F firstly increases then decreases as Fig. 2 shows.

In Fig. 2 , we can also find that micro-average F 1 reaches its maximum value just in the point where preci-sion and recall have an equal value, that point is called break-even point. In this paper, the micro-average F used as the performance measurement and the basic criterion of the three parameters. In our experiments we changed the value of LSI-k to an integer between 70 and 230 by step 10, k -NN-k to an integer between 5 and 50 by step 5 and threshold to a value between 0.1 and 0.55 by step 0.05 to get the optimal micro-average F
Fig. 2 , the best system performance can be obtained when the threshold value is set to 0.35. 4.3. Baseline runs
It is well known that the system performance is sensitive to the collection characteristics, so we focus on comparisons of text categorization on the same data set. In this section, we establish the traditional text categorization system. On each data set, we applied the text categorization techniques described in Section 2 , and computed the micro-average F 1 of all the categories and the 10 most frequent categories. The best
F results with the corresponding preferences of the baseline runs are shown in Table 4 , where  X  X  X hIN-SEK ! ChIN-URL X  X  means that the training set of ChIN-SEK is used to predict the categories of the web pages in the test set of ChIN-URL, and  X  X  X hIN-SEK + ChIN-URL ! ChIN-URL X  X  means using the training sets of ChIN-SEK and ChIN-URL together to predict the test set of ChIN-URL.

The results show that the performance on Reuters-21578 is better than that on the ChIN data sets, which can be explained by the category distributions in the data sets described in Table 2 and the hierarchical cat-egorization of ChIN data sets. We can also find that the performance of the 10 most frequent categories is always better than that of all categories on each data set. It is because that a larger category often has more voting documents than a smaller category in an uneven data set. For the ChIN data sets, the 10 most frequent categories include all the top-level seven categories of the hierarchical category structure. It means that the to that of the lower-level categories.

Comparing the results on ChIN-SEK with ChIN-SE, we can find the improvement of effectiveness by appending the corresponding keywords, domain knowledge in some sense, to the summary pages. So we prefer
ChIN-SEK to ChIN-SE as data sets in the following runs.
The results also show that the categorization effectiveness on chemical web pages in ChIN-URL is inferior to that on summary pages. It is perhaps because that ChIN-URL data set has fewer training documents and more noisy data than ChIN-SE. When using the training documents in ChIN-URL and ChIN-SEK together to predict the categories of the test chemical web pages in ChIN-URL, we found in surprise that the perfor-mance did not become better as supposed. The cause of the problem is probably that the entropy of the united training set is increased, which makes the useless information hide the useful information and confuses the semantic representation of the training vector space. So, a new voting method is introduced in Section 4.5 to try to resolve this problem. 4.4. Dictionary-based runs
In this section, the experimental results of the dictionary-based text categorization on the data sets are discussed. 4.4.1. Effects of refined level of dictionaries on performance
Table 5 show that using dictionary can improve the categorization performance and the more refined the dic-tionary is, the better effectiveness can be got. We can also find that when the dictionary includes too many noisy data that are not about chemistry, such as ChemDic-I, the performance becomes worse on the ChIN-SEK data set.

Integrating automatic segmentation, the dictionary-based text categorization system consequently needs more time to extract features. The corresponding running time of the dictionary-based categorization with dif-ferent dictionaries on ChIN-SEK is listed in Table 6 . In the training phase, SVD decomposition costs most of the time, while in the test phase the k -NN classification of each test document is the main task. We can find that ChemDict-III again has the faster execution speed than other dictionaries but is still slower than without dictionary. A well-refined dictionary not only improves the performance but also accelerates the execution speed of dictionary-based categorization system. So the manually revised dictionary ChemDict-III is used to represent the chemical knowledge in the following tests.

It may be worth mentioning that the running speed is not the key issue in text categorization task for web pages in the chemistry-focused search engine, since the categories of web pages are usually previously assigned before showing to users.
 4.4.2. Effects of expansion strategies of dictionary terms on performance
After term matching between a document and chemistry dictionary, it should be considered how to deal with those matching terms in the dictionary-based method. We tried two strategies to expand the documents by the matching terms, and compared the experimental results with the traditional system that did nothing about the terms as shown in Table 7 . The two strategies are separately adding the matching terms one time or two times into the documents. Results show that the second strategy can get relatively better performance.
It denotes that different strategies have influence upon the categorization performance, and the corresponding strategy optimization is a considerable issue in the future. 4.4.3. Performance comparison of dictionary-based runs with baseline runs
The dictionary-based text categorization is done on the data sets with ChemDict-III and expansion strategy by adding the matching terms two times. The results are listed in Table 8 . We can find the improvements in categorization effectiveness on all the ChIN data sets when compared with the traditional text categorization, while the deterioration on the Reuters-21578 collection as shown in Fig. 3 .

The different effects of the dictionary-based categorization on the data sets are mainly caused by the differ-that ChIN-URL and ChIN-SEK have the similar distributions of dictionary terms and have more frequency and number of dictionary terms than Reuters-21578 collection. The linear regression analysis between dictio-nary terms and all the terms in the documents also shows that the dictionary terms have more significant roles in the ChIN data sets than in the Reuters-21578. That is why the categorization effectiveness becomes not bet-ter but worse, when the dictionary-based categorization is applied on Reuters-21578.

We can also observe that the frequency of dictionary terms in ChIN-SEK is more than in ChIN-URL. It causes less improvement of categorization effectiveness on ChIN-SEK than that on ChIN-URL ( Fig. 3 ), when directly adding the matching dictionary terms to expand the documents.

Macro significance test (S-test) ( Yang &amp; Liu, 1999 ) is used to compare the detailed F nary-based run and the baseline run on all the categories of ChIN-URL data set and shows that the P -value ( Z P 3.53) is 0.0002078. This indicates that the improvement of the dictionary-based runs over the baseline runs is significant.
 4.5. Voting runs
In this section, a new voting method is introduced to improve the categorization effectiveness for chemical web pages in ChIN-URL test set. Since the documents in ChIN-SEK and ChIN-URL data sets represent the chemical information from the same sources and use the same categorization structure, they should be com-bined together to predict the categories of chemical pages more effectively. However, Tables 4 and 8 both show that using the united training set of ChIN-SEK and ChIN-URL to classify the chemical web pages in the
ChIN-URL test set just leads to undesirable results. So, we propose a new voting method to make full use of the information in the ChIN data sets. First, the dictionary-based categorization is done separately using the training set of ChIN-SEK and that of ChIN-URL to predict the web pages in the test set of ChIN-URL, relevant categories as follows: where r ci ( q ) is the rank of category ci for query page q , r query q from categorization results separately on ChIN-SEK and ChIN-URL training sets, Cs and Cu mean the sets of resultant categories from categorization separately on ChIN-SEK and ChIN-URL training sets.
Finally, the relevant categories are assigned to the query web page if the corresponding rank r than a threshold value. The threshold value is also determined by the optimal micro-average F
The experimental results are shown in Table 10 . Comparison with the baseline runs, we can found signif-icant improvement of effectiveness when the voting method is used ( Fig. 5 ).  X  X  X hIN-SEK &amp; ChIN-URL !
ChIN-URL X  X  in Table 10 means using the categorization results separately on ChIN-SEK and ChIN-URL training sets to vote out the final relevant categories of chemical web pages in the ChIN-URL test set.
The macro sign test comparing the voting runs with the baseline runs shows that the P -value ( Z P 4.84) is 6.492E 7. This also indicates that the improvement of voting runs over baseline runs is significant. 5. Conclusion
A new dictionary-based categorization approach is proposed and implemented to classify the chemical web pages in this paper. This approach has been examined on the Reuters-21578 and data sets from the ChIN web site.

The experimental results show that the dictionary-based categorization system outperforms the traditional k -NN categorization system when classifying the chemical web pages, and using the more refined chemistry dictionary can get the more improvement of both effectiveness and execution speed. The results also show that the distributions of categories, documents and dictionary terms of data sets have significant effects on the categorization efficiency of the system. Moreover, a new voting method is introduced to achieve better perfor-mance by combining the results of two data sets to predict the categories of the chemical web pages.
So, when domain knowledge is represented as a machine-readable dictionary, the proposed dictionary-based text categorization approach and the relevant conclusion in this paper should be applicable to classify the chemical web pages or other domain documents more efficiently.

Future research is needed on the issues, such as strategy optimization of expanding a document by match-ing dictionary terms, applying the dictionary-based text categorization approach to other machine learning formance for domain-specific web pages.
