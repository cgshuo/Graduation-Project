 Twitter, a new microblogging website, has attracted hundreds of millions of users who publish short messages (a.k.a. tweets ) on it. They either pub-lish original tweets or retweet (i.e. forward) oth-ers X  tweets if they find them interesting. Twitter has been shown to be useful in a number of appli-cations, including tweets as social sensors of real-time events (Sakaki et al., 2010), the sentiment pre-diction power of Twitter (Tumasjan et al., 2010), etc. However, current explorations are still in an early stage and our understanding of Twitter content still remains limited. How to automatically under-stand, extract and summarize useful Twitter content has therefore become an important and emergent re-search topic.

In this paper, we propose to extract keyphrases as a way to summarize Twitter content. Tradition-ally, keyphrases are defined as a short list of terms to summarize the topics of a document (Turney, 2000). It can be used for various tasks such as document summarization (Litvak and Last, 2008) and index-ing (Li et al., 2004). While it appears natural to use keyphrases to summarize Twitter content, compared with traditional text collections, keyphrase extrac-tion from Twitter is more challenging in at least two aspects: 1) Tweets are much shorter than traditional articles and not all tweets contain useful informa-tion; 2) Topics tend to be more diverse in Twitter than in formal articles such as news reports.
So far there is little work on keyword or keyphrase extraction from Twitter. Wu et al. (2010) proposed to automatically generate personalized tags for Twit-ter users. However, user-level tags may not be suit-able to summarize the overall Twitter content within a certain period and/or from a certain group of peo-ple such as people in the same region. Existing work on keyphrase extraction identifies keyphrases from either individual documents or an entire text collec-tion (Turney, 2000; Tomokiyo and Hurst, 2003). These approaches are not immediately applicable to Twitter because it does not make sense to ex-tract keyphrases from a single tweet, and if we ex-tract keyphrases from a whole tweet collection we will mix a diverse range of topics together, which makes it difficult for users to follow the extracted keyphrases.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose to study the novel problem of extracting topical keyphrases for summarizing and analyzing Twitter content. In other words, we extract and organize keyphrases by top-ics learnt from Twitter. In our work, we follow the standard three steps of keyphrase extraction, namely, keyword ranking, candidate keyphrase generation and keyphrase ranking. For keyword ranking, we modify the Topical PageRank method proposed by Liu et al. (2010) by introducing topic-sensitive score propagation. We find that topic-sensitive propaga-tion can largely help boost the performance. For keyphrase ranking, we propose a principled proba-bilistic phrase ranking method, which can be flex-ibly combined with any keyword ranking method and candidate keyphrase generation method. Ex-periments on a large Twitter data set show that our proposed methods are very effective in topical keyphrase extraction from Twitter. Interestingly, our proposed keyphrase ranking method can incorporate users X  interests by modeling the retweet behavior. We further examine what topics are suitable for in-corporating users X  interests for topical keyphrase ex-traction.

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study how to extract keyphrases from mi-croblogs. We perform a thorough analysis of the proposed methods, which can be useful for future work in this direction. Our work is related to unsupervised keyphrase ex-traction. Graph-based ranking methods are the state of the art in unsupervised keyphrase extrac-tion. Mihalcea and Tarau (2004) proposed to use TextRank, a modified PageRank algorithm to ex-tract keyphrases. Based on the study by Mihalcea and Tarau (2004), Liu et al. (2010) proposed to de-compose a traditional random walk into multiple random walks specific to various topics. Language modeling methods (Tomokiyo and Hurst, 2003) and natural language processing techniques (Barker and Cornacchia, 2000) have also been used for unsuper-vised keyphrase extraction. Our keyword extraction method is mainly based on the study by Liu et al. (2010). The difference is that we model the score propagation with topic context, which can lower the effect of noise, especially in microblogs.

Our work is also related to automatic topic label-ing (Mei et al., 2007). We focus on extracting topical keyphrases in microblogs, which has its own chal-lenges. Our method can also be used to label topics in other text collections.

Another line of relevant research is Twitter-related text mining. The most relevant work is by Wu et al. (2010), who directly applied Tex-tRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) to extract key-words from tweets to tag users. Topic discovery from Twitter is also related to our work (Ramage et al., 2010), but we further extract keyphrases from each topic for summarizing and analyzing Twitter content. 3.1 Preliminaries Let U be a set of Twitter users. Let C = {{ d u,m } M u m =1 } u  X  X  be a collection of tweets gener-ated by U , where M u is the total number of tweets generated by user u and d u,m is the m -th tweet of u . Let V be the vocabulary. d u,m consists of a where N u,m is the number of words in d u,m and w u,m,n  X  V ( 1  X  n  X  N u,m ). We also assume that there is a set of topics T over the collection C .
Given T and C , topical keyphrase extraction is to discover a list of keyphrases for each topic t  X  T . Here each keyphrase is a sequence of words.

To extract keyphrases, we first identify topics from the Twitter collection using topic models (Sec-tion 3.2). Next for each topic, we run a topical PageRank algorithm to rank keywords and then gen-erate candidate keyphrases using the top ranked key-words (Section 3.3). Finally, we use a probabilis-tic model to rank the candidate keyphrases (Sec-tion 3.4). 3.2 Topic discovery We first describe how we discover the set of topics T . Author-topic models have been shown to be ef-fective for topic modeling of microblogs (Weng et al., 2010; Hong and Davison, 2010). In Twit-ter, we observe an important characteristic of tweets: tweets are short and a single tweet tends to be about a single topic. So we apply a modified author-topic model called Twitter-LDA introduced by Zhao et al. (2011), which assumes a single topic assignment for an entire tweet.
 The model is based on the following assumptions. There is a set of topics T in Twitter, each represented by a word distribution. Each user has her topic inter-ests modeled by a distribution over the topics. When a user wants to write a tweet, she first chooses a topic based on her topic distribution. Then she chooses a bag of words one by one based on the chosen topic. However, not all words in a tweet are closely re-lated to the topic of that tweet; some are background words commonly used in tweets on different topics. Therefore, for each word in a tweet, the user first decides whether it is a background word or a topic word and then chooses the word from its respective word distribution.

Formally, let  X  t denote the word distribution for topic t and  X  B the word distribution for background words. Let  X  u denote the topic distribution of user u . Let  X  denote a Bernoulli distribution that gov-erns the choice between background words and topic words. The generation process of tweets is described in Figure 1. Each multinomial distribution is gov-erned by some symmetric Dirichlet distribution pa-rameterized by  X  ,  X  or  X  . 3.3 Topical PageRank for Keyword Ranking Topical PageRank was introduced by Liu et al. (2010) to identify keywords for future keyphrase extraction. It runs topic-biased PageRank for each topic separately and boosts those words with high relevance to the corresponding topic. Formally, the topic-specific PageRank scores can be defined as follows: where R t ( w ) is the topic-specific PageRank score of word w in topic t , e ( w j ,w i ) is the weight for the edge ( w j  X  w i ) , O ( w j ) = P w 0 e ( w j ,w 0 ) and  X  is a damping factor ranging from 0 to 1. The topic-specific preference value P t ( w ) for each word w is its random jumping probability with the constraint that P w  X  X  P t ( w ) = 1 given topic t . A large R t (  X  ) indicates a word is a good candidate keyword in topic t . We denote this original version of the Topi-cal PageRank as TPR .

However, the original TPR ignores the topic con-text when setting the edge weights; the edge weight is set by counting the number of co-occurrences of the two words within a certain window size. Tak-ing the topic of  X  X lectronic products X  as an exam-ple, the word  X  X uice X  may co-occur frequently with a good keyword  X  X pple X  for this topic because of Ap-ple electronic products, so  X  X uice X  may be ranked high by this context-free co-occurrence edge weight although it is not related to electronic products. In other words, context-free propagation may cause the scores to be off-topic.

So in this paper, we propose to use a topic context sensitive PageRank method. Formally, we have
Here we compute the propagation from w j to w i in the context of topic t , namely, the edge weight from w j to w i is parameterized by t . In this paper, we compute edge weight e t ( w j ,w i ) between two words by counting the number of co-occurrences of these two words in tweets assigned to topic t . We denote this context-sensitive topical PageRank as cTPR .
After keyword ranking using cTPR or any other method, we adopt a common candidate keyphrase generation method proposed by Mihalcea and Tarau (2004) as follows. We first select the top S keywords for each topic, and then look for combinations of these keywords that occur as frequent phrases in the text collection. More details are given in Section 4. 3.4 Probabilistic Models for Topical Keyphrase With the candidate keyphrases, our next step is to rank them. While a standard method is to simply aggregate the scores of keywords inside a candidate keyphrase as the score for the keyphrase, here we propose a different probabilistic scoring function. Our method is based on the following hypotheses about good keyphrases given a topic: Relevance : A good keyphrase should be closely re-lated to the given topic and also discriminative. For example, for the topic  X  X ews, X   X  president obama  X  is a good keyphrase while  X  math class  X  is not. Interestingness : A good keyphrase should be inter-esting and can attract users X  attention. For example, for the topic  X  X usic, X   X  justin bieber  X  is more inter-esting than  X  song player . X 
Sometimes, there is a trade-off between these two properties and a good keyphrase has to balance both.
Let R be a binary variable to denote relevance where 1 is relevant and 0 is irrelevant. Let I be an-other binary variable to denote interestingness where 1 is interesting and 0 is non-interesting. Let k denote a candidate keyphrase. Following the probabilistic relevance models in information retrieval (Lafferty and Zhai, 2003), we propose to use P ( R = 1 ,I = 1 | t,k ) to rank candidate keyphrases for topic t . We have Here we have assumed that I is independent of t and R given k , i.e. the interestingness of a keyphrase is independent of the topic or whether the keyphrase is relevant to the topic. We have also assumed that R is independent of t when k is unknown, i.e. without knowing the keyphrase, the relevance is independent of the topic. Our assumptions can be depicted by Figure 2.

We further define  X  = P ( R =0) P ( R =1) . In general we can assume that P ( R = 0) P ( R = 1) because there are much more non-relevant keyphrases than relevant ones, that is,  X  1 . In this case, we have
We can see that the ranking score log P ( R = 1 ,I = 1 | t,k ) can be decomposed into two components, a score log P ( I = 1 | k ) . The last term log  X  is a con-stant and thus not relevant.
 Estimating the relevance score
Let a keyphrase candidate k be a sequence of words ( w 1 ,w 2 ,...,w N ) . Based on an independent assumption of words given R and t , we have
Given the topic model  X  t previously learned for topic t , we can set P ( w | t,R = 1) to  X  t w , i.e. the probability of w under  X  t . Following Griffiths and Steyvers (2004), we estimate  X  t w as
Here C t denotes the collection of tweets assigned to topic t , #( C t ,w ) is the number of times w appears in C , and #( C t ,  X  ) is the total number of words in C t .
P ( w | t,R = 0) can be estimated using a smoothed background model.

Here #( C ,  X  ) denotes the number of words in the whole collection C , and #( C ,w ) denotes the number of times w appears in the whole collection.
 After plugging Equation (5) and Equation (6) into Equation (4), we get the following formula for the relevance score: of words in k .
 Estimating the interestingness score
To capture the interestingness of keyphrases, we make use of the retweeting behavior in Twitter. We use string matching with RT to determine whether a tweet is an original posting or a retweet. If a tweet is interesting, it tends to get retweeted mul-tiple times. Retweeting is therefore a stronger indi-cator of user interests than tweeting. We use retweet zero frequency, we use a modified add-one smooth-ing method. Finally, we get
Here | ReTweets k | and | Tweets k | denote the num-bers of retweets and tweets containing the keyphrase k , respectively, and l avg is the average number of tweets that a candidate keyphrase appears in.
Finally, we can plug Equation (7) and Equa-tion (8) into Equation (3) and obtain the following scoring function for ranking: Incorporating length preference
Our preliminary experiments with Equation (9) show that this scoring function usually ranks longer keyphrases higher than shorter ones. However, be-cause our candidate keyphrase are extracted without using any linguistic knowledge such as noun phrase boundaries, longer candidate keyphrases tend to be less meaningful as a phrase. Moreover, for our task of using keyphrases to summarize Twitter, we hy-pothesize that shorter keyphrases are preferred by users as they are more compact. We would there-fore like to incorporate some length preference.
Recall that Equation (9) is derived from P ( R = 1 ,I = 1 | t,k ) , but this probability does not allow us to directly incorporate any length preference. We further observe that Equation (9) tends to give longer keyphrases higher scores mainly due to the term | k |  X  . So here we heuristically incorporate our length preference by removing | k |  X  from Equation (9), re-sulting in the following final scoring function: 4.1 Data Set and Preprocessing We use a Twitter data set collected from Singapore users for evaluation. We used Twitter REST API 1 to facilitate the data collection. The majority of the tweets collected were published in a 20-week period from December 1, 2009 through April 18, 2010. We removed common stopwords and words which ap-peared in fewer than 10 tweets. We also removed all users who had fewer than 5 tweets. Some statistics of this data set after cleaning are shown in Table 1.
We ran Twitter-LDA with 500 iterations of Gibbs sampling. After trying a few different numbers of topics, we empirically set the number of topics to 30. We set  X  to 50 . 0 / |T| as Griffiths and Steyvers (2004) suggested, but set  X  to a smaller value of 0.01 and  X  to 20. We chose these parameter settings be-cause they generally gave coherent and meaningful topics for our data set. We selected 10 topics that cover a diverse range of content in Twitter for eval-uation of topical keyphrase extraction. The top 10 words of these topics are shown in Table 2.

We also tried the standard LDA model and the author-topic model on our data set and found that our proposed topic model was better or at least com-parable in terms of finding meaningful topics. In ad-dition to generating meaningful topics, Twitter-LDA is much more convenient in supporting the compu-tation of tweet-level statistics (e.g. the number of co-occurrences of two words in a specific topic) than the standard LDA or the author-topic model because Twitter-LDA assumes a single topic assignment for an entire tweet. 4.2 Methods for Comparison As we have described in Section 3.1, there are three steps to generate keyphrases, namely, keyword rank-ing, candidate keyphrase generation, and keyphrase ranking. We have proposed a context-sensitive top-ical PageRank method ( cTPR ) for the first step of keyword ranking, and a probabilistic scoring func-tion for the third step of keyphrase ranking. We now describe the baseline methods we use to compare with our proposed methods.
 Keyword Ranking
We compare our cTPR method with the original topical PageRank method (Equation (1)), which rep-resents the state of the art. We refer to this baseline as TPR .

For both TPR and cTPR , the damping factor is empirically set to 0 . 1 , which always gives the best performance based on our preliminary experiments. We use normalized P ( t | w ) to set P t ( w ) because our preliminary experiments showed that this was the best among the three choices discussed by Liu et al. (2010). This finding is also consistent with what Liu et al. (2010) found.

In addition, we also use two other baselines for comparison: (1) kwBL1 : ranking by P ( w | t ) =  X  t w . (2) kwBL2 : ranking by P ( t | w ) = P ( t )  X  t w Keyphrase Ranking
We use kpRelInt to denote our relevance and inter-estingness based keyphrase ranking function P ( R = 1 ,I = 1 | t,k ) , i.e. Equation (10).  X  and  X  are em-pirically set to 0.01 and 500. Usually  X  can be set to zero, but in our experiments we find that our rank-ing method needs a more uniform estimation of the background model. We use the following ranking functions for comparison:  X  kpBL1 : Similar to what is used by Liu et al.  X  kpBL2 : We consider another baseline ranking  X  kpRel : If we consider only relevance but 4.3 Gold Standard Generation Since there is no existing test collection for topi-cal keyphrase extraction from Twitter, we manually constructed our test collection. For each of the 10 selected topics, we ran all the methods to rank key-words. For each method we selected the top 3000 keywords and searched all the combinations of these words as phrases which have a frequency larger than 30. In order to achieve high phraseness, we first computed the minimum value of pointwise mutual information for all bigrams in one combination, and we removed combinations having a value below a threshold, which was empirically set to 2 . 135 . Then we merged all these candidate phrases. We did not consider single-word phrases because we found that it would include too many frequent words that might not be useful for summaries.

We asked two judges to judge the quality of the candidate keyphrases. The judges live in Singapore and had used Twitter before. For each topic, the judges were given the top topic words and a short topic description. Web search was also available. For each candidate keyphrase, we asked the judges to score it as follows: 2 (relevant, meaningful and in-formative), 1 (relevant but either too general or too specific, or informal) and 0 (irrelevant or meaning-less). Here in addition to relevance, the other two criteria, namely, whether a phrase is meaningful and informative, were studied by Tomokiyo and Hurst (2003). We then averaged the scores of the two judges as the final scores. The Cohen X  X  Kappa co-efficients of the 10 topics range from 0.45 to 0.80, showing fair to good agreement 2 . We further dis-carded all candidates with an average score less than 1. The number of the remaining keyphrases for each topic ranges from 56 to 282. 4.4 Evaluation Metrics Traditionally keyphrase extraction is evaluated using precision and recall on all the extracted keyphrases. We choose not to use these measures for the fol-lowing reasons: (1) Traditional keyphrase extraction works on single documents while we study topical keyphrase extraction. The gold standard keyphrase list for a single document is usually short and clean, while for each Twitter topic there can be many keyphrases, some are more relevant and interesting than others. (2) Our extracted topical keyphrases are meant for summarizing Twitter content, and they are likely to be directly shown to the users. It is there-fore more meaningful to focus on the quality of the top-ranked keyphrases.

Inspired by the popular nDCG metric in informa-define the following normalized keyphrase quality measure ( nKQM ) for a method M : where T is the set of topics, M t,j is the j -th keyphrase generated by method M for topic t , score (  X  ) is the average score from the two hu-man judges, and IdealScore ( K,t ) is the normalization factor X  X core of the top K keyphrases of topic t un-der the ideal ranking. Intuitively, if M returns more good keyphrases in top ranks, its nKQM value will be higher.

We also use mean average precision (MAP) to measure the overall performance of keyphrase rank-ing: where 1 ( S ) is an indicator function which returns 1 when S is true and 0 otherwise, N M ,t,j denotes the number of correct keyphrases among the top j keyphrases returned by M for topic t , and N M ,t de-notes the total number of correct keyphrases of topic t returned by M . 4.5 Experiment Results Evaluation of keyword ranking methods
Since keyword ranking is the first step for keyphrase extraction, we first compare our keyword ranking method cTPR with other methods. For each topic, we pooled the top 20 keywords ranked by all four methods. We manually examined whether a word is a good keyword or a noisy word based on topic context. Then we computed the average num-ber of noisy words in the 10 topics for each method. As shown in Table 5, we can observe that cTPR per-formed the best among the four methods.

Since our final goal is to extract topical keyphrases, we further compare the performance of cTPR and TPR when they are combined with a keyphrase ranking algorithm. Here we use the two baseline keyphrase ranking algorithms kpBL1 and kpBL2 . The comparison is shown in Table 3. We can see that cTPR is consistently better than the three other methods for both kpBL1 and kpBL2 .
 Evaluation of keyphrase ranking methods
In this section we compare keypharse ranking methods. Previously we have shown that cTPR is better than TPR , kwBL1 and kwBL2 for keyword ranking. Therefore we use cTPR as the keyword ranking method and examine the keyphrase rank-ing method kpRelInt with kpBL1 , kpBL2 and kpRel when they are combined with cTPR . The results are shown in Table 4. From the results we can see the following: (1) Keyphrase ranking methods kpRelInt and kpRel are more effective than kpBL1 and kpBL2 , especially when using the nKQM metric. (2) kpRe-lInt is better than kpRel , especially for the nKQM metric. Interestingly, we also see that for the nKQM metric, kpBL1 , which is the most commonly used keyphrase ranking method, did not perform as well as kpBL2 , a modified version of kpBL1 .

We also tested kpRelInt and kpRel on TPR , kwBL1 and kwBL2 and found that kpRelInt and kpRel are consistently better than kpBL2 and kpBL1 . Due to space limit, we do not report all the results here. These findings support our assumption that our pro-posed keyphrase ranking method is effective.
The comparison between kpBL2 with kpBL1 shows that taking the product of keyword scores is more effective than taking their sum. kpRel and kpRelInt also use the product of keyword scores. This may be because there is more noise in Twit-ter than traditional documents. Common words (e.g.  X  X ood X ) and domain background words (e.g.  X  X in-gapore X ) tend to gain higher weights during keyword ranking due to their high frequency, especially in graph-based method, but we do not want such words to contribute too much to keyphrase scores. Taking the product of keyword scores is therefore more suit-able here than taking their sum.
 Further analysis of interestingness
As shown in Table 4, kpRelInt performs better in terms of nKQM compared with kpRel . Here we study why it worked better for keyphrase ranking. The only difference between kpRel and kpRelInt is that kpRelInt includes the factor of user interests. By manually examining the top keyphrases, we find that the topics  X  X ovie-TV X  ( T 5 ),  X  X ews X  ( T 12 ),  X  X usic X  ( T 20 ) and  X  X ports X  ( T 25 ) particularly benefited from kpRelInt compared with other topics. We find that well-known named entities (e.g. celebrities, politi-cal leaders, football clubs and big companies) and significant events tend to be ranked higher by kpRe-lInt than kpRel .

We then counted the numbers of entity and event keyphrases for these four topics retrieved by differ-ent methods, shown in Table 6 . We can see that in these four topics, kpRelInt is consistently better than kpRel in terms of the number of entity and event keyphrases retrieved.
On the other hand, we also find that for some topics interestingness helped little or even hurt the performance a little, e.g. for the topics  X  X ood X  and  X  X raffic. X  We find that the keyphrases in these top-ics are stable and change less over time. This may suggest that we can modify our formula to handle different topics different. We will explore this direc-tion in our future work.
 Parameter settings
We also examine how the parameters in our model affect the performance.  X  : We performed a search from 0.1 to 0.9 with a step size of 0.1. We found  X  = 0 . 1 was the optimal parameter for cTPR and TPR . However, TPR is more sensitive to  X  . The performance went down quickly with  X  increasing.  X  : We checked the overall performance with  X   X  { 400 , 450 , 500 , 550 , 600 } . We found that  X  = 500  X  0 . 01 |V| gave the best performance gener-ally for cTPR . The performance difference is not very significant between these different values of  X  , which indicates that the our method is robust. 4.6 Qualitative evaluation of cTPR + kpRelInt We show the top 10 keyphrases discovered by cTPR + kRelInt in Table 7. We can observe that these keyphrases are clear, interesting and informative for summarizing Twitter topics.

We hypothesize that the following applications can benefit from the extracted keyphrases: Automatic generation of realtime trendy phrases: For exampoe, keyphrases in the topic  X  X ood X  ( T 2 ) can be used to help online restaurant reviews. Event detection and topic tracking: In the topic  X  X ews X  top keyphrases can be used as candidate trendy topics for event detection and topic tracking. Automatic discovery of important named entities: As discussed previously, our methods tend to rank important named entities such as celebrities in high ranks. In this paper, we studied the novel problem of topical keyphrase extraction for summarizing and analyzing Twitter content. We proposed the context-sensitive topical PageRank (cTPR) method for keyword rank-ing. Experiments showed that cTPR is consistently better than the original TPR and other baseline meth-ods in terms of top keyword and keyphrase extrac-tion. For keyphrase ranking, we proposed a prob-abilistic ranking method, which models both rele-vance and interestingness of keyphrases. In our ex-periments, this method is shown to be very effec-tive to boost the performance of keyphrase extrac-tion for different kinds of keyword ranking methods. In the future, we may consider how to incorporate keyword scores into our keyphrase ranking method. Note that we propose to rank keyphrases by a gen-eral formula P ( R = 1 ,I = 1 | t,k ) and we have made some approximations based on reasonable assump-tions. There should be other potential ways to esti-mate P ( R = 1 ,I = 1 | t,k ) .
