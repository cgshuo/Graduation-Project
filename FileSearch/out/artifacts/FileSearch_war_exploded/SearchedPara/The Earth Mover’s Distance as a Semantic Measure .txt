 independent in most existing similarity measures, which is not often true in practice. The sema ntic relatedness between words cannot be conveniently employed in the existing measures. We propose a novel similarity measure based on the earth mover X  X  distance (EMD). In the proposed m easure, the semantic distances between words are computed based on the electronic lexical database-WordNet and then the EMD is employed to calculate the document similarity with a many-to-many matching between words. Experiments and results de monstrate the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure.

Measuring pairwise document simila rity is essential to various text retrieval and mining tasks, su ch as clustering, filtering and similarity search. Most existing similarity measures (e.g. cosine measure) assume that different w ords are unusually semantically independent and in the similarity calculation process one word in a document can only be matched to the same word in another document. However, different wo rds could express the same or similar meanings due to the synonym phenomenon. An example of synonyms is the words  X  X at X  and  X  X eline X . Moreover, a word could express different meanings in different context due to the polysemy phenomenon in natural language. For Example, the word  X  X ank X  can mean  X  X he ri sing ground bordering a lake, river, or sea X  or  X  X n establishment for the custody, loan, exchange, or issue of money X  in different contex ts. There is also other semantic hypernymy/hyponymy, and all these phenomena in natural language argue that words are not independent with each other in reality. Extremely, a document c ontaining one set of words might be semantically simila r to another document containing a different set of words. Most existing measures cannot conveniently employ the semantic relatedn ess between words and capture the semantic similarity between documents. 
We propose a novel similarity measure based on the earth mover X  X  distance (EMD) to address this problem. In the proposed measure, the semantic distances between words are computed based on the electronic lexical database-WordNet and then the EMD is employed to measure document similarity with a many-to-many matching between words. The EMD-based measure naturally extends the notion of a semantic distance between single words to that of a similarity distance between documents. The similarity between documents is attained by solving a many-to-many matching problem. 
In the proposed similarity mea sure, the semantic distances computed with the vector measure [3] based on the electronic lexical database-WordNet. Where either or both of the words have more than one synset in Wordnet, we take the semantic distance of the most-related pair of synsets. The more  X  X imilar X  two words are, the smaller the semantic distance is. For example, the semantic distance is 0.000 between  X  X ar X  and  X  X utomobile X , and 0.173 between  X  X ar X  and  X  X us X . Given n words, totally n(n-1)/2 calculations are needed. 
The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) [4] is a method to evaluate dissimilarity between two multi-di mensional distributions in some feature space where a distance measure between single features, which we call the ground distance is given. The EMD  X  X ifts X  this distance from individual features to full distributions. Computing the EMD is based on a solution to the well-known transportation distributions of documents, and a weighted graph is constructed to model the similarity between two documents, and then the EMD is employed to compute the minimum cost of the weighted graph as the similarity value between two documents. The problem is formalized as follows: 
Given two document A and B, a weighted graph G is constructed as follows: z Let D={d ij } as the distance matrix where d ij is the semantic z Let G={A, B, D} as a weighted graph constructed by A, B 
In the weighted graph G, we want to find a flow F={f ij }, where f is the flow between t ai and t bj , that minimizes the overall cost subject to the following constraints: Constraint (2) allows moving w ords from A to B and not vice by the words in A to their weights. Constraint (4) limits the words in B to receive no more words than their weights. Constraint (5) forces to move the maximum amount of words possible. We call this amount the total flow. On ce the transportation problem is solved, and we have found the optim al flow F, the earth mover X  X  distance is defined as the resulting work normalized by the total flow: 
The normalization factor is in troduced in order to avoid favoring shorter document in the cas e of partial ma tching. Finally, the similarity between documents A and B is defined as: 
Sim EMD (A,B) is normalized in the range of [0,1]. The higher the value of Sim EMD (A,B) , the more similar the documents A and B. 
Efficient algorithms for the transportation problem are available, which are important to compute EMD efficiently. 
Figure 1 shows a many-to-many ma tching example. The word  X  X ar X  in text A can flow to the words  X  X us X  and  X  X utomobile X  in text B. The word  X  X otorcar X  in text A can also flow to both the words  X  X us X  and  X  X utom obile X  in text B. 
We employ document similarity search to test the effectiveness of similarity measures, includ ing the EMD-based measure, the cosine measure, the jaccard measure, the dice measure, the overlap measure and the information the oretic measure (IT-sim) [2]. A query document is compared with all documents in the collection based on different similarity measures and a ranked list of 200 most similar documents is returned for each measure. Then the returned document list is compared with the ground truth list. We build the ground truth data set fr om the TDT-3 corpus, which has been used for evaluation of the task of topic detection and tracking [1] in 1999 and 2000. 120 topics are defined and about 9000 stories are annotated over these topics with an  X  X n-topic X  table presenting all stories explicitly mark ed as relevant to a given topic. The on-topic stories within the same topic are similar and relevant. After removing the stories writte n in Chinese, we use 40 topics and more than 2500 stories as a test set, while the others are used topic is considered as the query document and all the other documents within the same topic are the relevant (similar) documents, while all the documents within other topics are considered irrelevant (dissimilar) to the query document. We use P@5, P@10 and average precision (AverageP) for evaluation. 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95
Figure 2. Performance comparison for different similarity 
The results are shown and compared in Figure 2. The upper bounds are the ideal values under the assumption that all the relevant (similar) documents are re trieved and ranked higher than those irrelevant (dissimilar) documents in the ranked list. If the number of relevant documents for a query document is smaller than 5 or 10, the P@5 or P@10 for this query will never reach 100%. We can see that the EMD-based similarity measure outperforms all other similarity measures. The many-to-many matching between semantically related words benefits the performance improvement. Though the semantic distances between words in the documents are computed regardless of their contexts, it might approximate to the accurate semantic distances to some extent. In future work, the technique of word sense disambiguation will be employed to accurately compute the semantic distances between words in different contexts.
