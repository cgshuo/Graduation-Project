Collaborative information technologies are generally understood as electronic technologies that support the work of groups of individuals engaged in collaborative tasks, usually in organizations. Let us assume, for example, a group of five mechanical engineers employed by the same automaker. Those mechanical engineers are located in five different cities and are engaged, through a Web-based conferencing system, in discussions about the design of a new fuel injection system for one of the company  X  s car models. The group would then be said to be making use of a collaborative information technology, in this case the just mentioned Web-based conferencing system.

The use of collaborative information technologies in organizations is on the rise, a trend that is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Such technologies, if properly used, may serve as the basis for serious cost-cutting and quality-enhancing organizational strategies such as outsourcing, strategic modularization, telecommuting, and virtual teamwork, such as in the automaker  X  s new product development team example provided above.

The practical relevance of collaborative information technologies has been reflected in academic research on the topic, which has taken a more applied orientation since the late 1990s and early 2000s. Yet, book volumes on the topic have been surprisingly scarce. This is a gap that  X  X  X ollaborative Information Technol-ogies X  X , a book edited by Mehdi Khosrow-Pour, aims at filling.

The book is a collection of 19 chapters by several authors; many of whom are well-known scholars and consultants in areas directly or indirectly related to the main topic of the book. The chapters cover a wide range of topics related to the main topic of collaborative information technologies. The book generally progresses from the discussion of conceptual issues in connection with the use of collaboration technolo-gies, to an exploration of the impact of those technologies on knowledge management and learning, to a review of issues and empirical findings related to virtual teams, and concluding with an exploration of what seem to be  X  X  X pecial topics X  X , like e-mail spam and mobile collaborative technologies.

The chapters devoted to conceptual issues in connection with the use of collaboration technologies cover topics such as organizational learning and knowledge communication, as well as define the different elements that characterize collaborative information technologies as such. They lay the foundation for the chapters that explore the impact of those technologies on knowledge management and learning, which in-clude a chapter on the award-winning longitudinal research on virtual team-based innovation by Ann Maj-chrzak and colleagues. This part of the book also includes two chapters on the use of collaborative information technologies in educational organizations that will be of interest to academics and higher edu-cation administrators.

The chapters reviewing issues and empirical findings related to virtual teams include a discussion on a very important subject, from the perspective of organizations that employ collaborative information tech-nologies, namely that of ad hoc virtual teams. That discussion is presented in a chapter, written by Guy
Pare and Line Dube, which explores the stages that an ad hoc virtual team goes through, and the role of collaborative information technologies as a team progresses through those stages.

The chapters exploring  X  X  X pecial topics X  X  target four main areas that are likely to be of interest to applied researchers, and particularly information technology managers. Two of those areas are the above mentioned e-mail spam and mobile collaborative technologies. The other two are meeting automation and a somewhat underrepresented area of inquiry, which Gill Mallalieu and colleagues refer to as the  X  X  X icked relationship between organizations and information technology X  X . This latter chapter is not really focused on collabora-tive information technologies, but its non-positivist, grounded theory-based (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998) explo-ration of the interplay between organizations  X  business processes and information systems will most likely be of interest to those implementing collaborative information technologies in organizations.

The book  X  s main strength is its breadth of coverage, and the depth of exploration of specific topics that is typical of edited academic volumes. Another key strength of this book is that it brings together topics that are likely to be relevant for several years, because they are not very dependent on technological issues or specific technologies that are likely to go away soon. For example, the issues of virtual teamwork and e-mail spam are likely to be as relevant five years from now as they were when the book was published in 2002.
One of the book  X  s two key weaknesses is the lack of a broad level grouping of chapters covering related topics, which can be easily addressed in further editions. In that respect, the chapters could have been grouped into 4 main categories, or book parts, namely: conceptual issues, knowledge management and dis-tributed learning, virtual teamwork, and special issues. In my opinion, the lack of such broad level grouping is likely to leave more than a few readers somewhat confused.

The other weakness of the book, which can only be considered an academic shortcoming, is in fact a the-oretical coverage deficiency that plagues much of the current research on collaborative information technol-ogies. That research often incorporates explanations and predictions that refer to both the technology itself and the social aspects surrounding the technology  X  s use. Yet, it almost completely ignores the notion that human beings are unlikely to be designed, from a biological perspective, to use collaborative information technologies X  X imply because we evolved over millions of years communicating face-to-face and face-to-face only. This perspective is not explored in the book, even though it provides a theoretical basis on which we can understand much of the behavioral responses that characterize virtual teams and  X  X  X icked problems X  X  in con-nection with the use of collaborative information technologies in organizations (see, e.g., Kock, 2004).
Nevertheless, the book  X  s strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The book is a great contribution to the scarce literature on collaborative information technologies, and hopefully a catalyst to more publish-ing initiatives in this area. It is an invaluable addition to both individual and institutional libraries, and an excellent resource for both researchers and organizational users of collaborative information technologies. Tech Mining: Exploiting New Technologies for Competitive Advantage. By Alan L. Porter and Scott W. Cunningham, John Wiley &amp; Son, 2005, 384 pages, $84.95, ISBN 0-4714-7567-X
Tech Mining is a book about how to inform technology management by mining a wide variety of pub-licly available databases on science and technology, notably scientific publications and patents. The pri-mary aim of the book is to introduce the basic objectives and tools of tech mining. The book aims to introduce pragmatic methods for what is also known as research profiling so as to inform decision making with the  X  big picture  X  of growing technologies.

The 16-chapter book is written with two distinct groups of readers in mind, corresponding to the two-part organization of the book. The first part, consisting of Chapters 1 through 5, aims to provide concep-tual bases for practical tech mining actions, for example, how it works, what it can do, and what to watch for in tech mining. A particular emphasis is on understanding how science and technology leads to success-ful technology commercialization. This part is especially written for professionals and managers, engineers, researchers, and business analysts. The second part, from Chapter 6 to Chapter 16, is devoted to detailed descriptions of how to put tech mining in practice. This part is primarily for information scientists, patent analysts, R&amp;D managers, and strategic planners.

According to Porter and Cunningham, tech mining is the application of text mining tools to science and technology information, informed by understanding of technological innovation processes. They distin-guish tech mining from data mining and text mining by its reliance on science and technology domain knowledge to inform its practice.

The book is also sending a strong message that tech mining is an integral part of a decision-making process. Porter and Cunningham utilize Herbert Simon  X  s three-phase decision making process to delineate the practical and procedural characteristics of tech mining, namely (1) intelligence , (2) design/analysis , and (3) choice . Using the three-phase process model has the advantage of describing how tech mining ought to be done in practice and how tech mining is actually performed; it contributes greatly to the clarity of the book.

The intelligence phase is introduced in Chapters 6 X 9. In particular, Chapter 6 is on finding the right sources. Chapter 7 is on forming the right query. Chapter 8 is on getting the data. Chapter 9 is on basic analyses.
 The design and analysis phase is developed in Chapters 10 X 12. Chapter 10 is on advanced analyses. Chapter 11 is on trend analyses. Chapter 12 is on patent analyses.

The choice phase is demonstrated in Chapters 13 X 16. Chapter 13 focuses on generating and present-ing innovation indicators. Chapter 14 addresses issues concerning managing the tech mining process.
