 In this paper, we propose a framework of multi-modal multi-correlation person-centric news retrieval, which integrates news event correlations, news entity correlations, and event-entity correlations simultaneously by exploring both text and image information. The proposed framework is con-fined to a person-name query and enables a more vivid and informative person-centric news retrieval by providing two views of result presentation, namely a query-oriented multi-correlation map and a ranking list of news items with neces-sary descriptions including news image, news title and sum-mary, central entities and relevant news events. First, we pre-process news articles using natural language techniques, and initialize the three correlations by statistical analysis about events and entities in news articles and face images. Second, a Multi-correlation Probabilistic Matrix Factoriza-tion (MPMF) algorithm is proposed to complete and refine the three correlations. Different from traditional Probabilis-tic Matrix Factorization (PMF), the proposed MPFM addi-tionally considers the event correlations and the entity cor-relations as well as the event-entity correlations during the factor analysis. Third, the result ranking and visualization are conducted to present search results relevant to a target news topic. Experimental results on a news dataset collected from multiple news websites demonstrate the attractive per-formance of the proposed solution for news retrieval.

Along with information technology development and in-ternet globalization, online news articles have enjoyed ex-plosive growth and received high popularity from over half of web users. Such spurting growth urges the necessity for efficient organizing the large amount of news articles from multiple new sources.

A news article is defined as a specific event arose by spe-cific people or an organization which happens at a certain time and place. That is, a news article corresponding to a specific news event can be identified according to the fol-lowing  X 4W X  elements: Who (person or organization), When (time), Where (locations), and What (event). In particu-lar,  X  X ho X  as a news entity should be paid special attention because the social network among different persons can be viewed as a kind of indirect connection among news events as well as their textual relevance. Accordingly, news event and news person should be considered as the two basic items in news retrieval, special for person-centric news retrieval in this paper. The both items are correlated to each other. Specifically, different news articles may be relevant when the news events happen on the same or related persons, and the persons appearing in the same news event should also be related by certain social interaction. As shown in Figure 1, the five news articles are related to some extent due to a shared person ( Yao Ming ), and different persons appearing in these articles are connected with specific social relation-ships, such as Yao Ming is the teammate of McGrady and Battier , the husband of Ye Li , and the rival of Howard . It is an important and challenging problem to effectively explore the both items and their within-and inter-correlations to organize and search possible relevant news events on Inter-net, so as to enable an informative overview about a target news topic.

Some researchers have fixed their attention on exploring correlations within news events or news entities in various news-related applications. However, most of them depend on the text analysis and neglect the inter-correlation mining between event and entity. Usually, news web pages con-tain news images to vividly describe a specific news event, in which central news actors (persons or an organization) and locations maybe appear. Thus, the importation of news images as well as textual details is valuable to deeply under-stand news articles, and to describe them more precisely. Currently, few work attempt to employ the multi-model analysis in news description, and jointly explore available correlations among events and entities to discover or correct some implicit ones during news retrieval.
 In this paper, we propose a framework of Multi-modal Multi-correlation Person-centric News Retrieval (MMPNR) by integrating news event correlations, news entity correla-tions, and event-entity correlations simultaneously and seam-lessly and employing both text information and image infor-mation. First, we pre-process news articles using common natural language techniques and face recognition technolo-gies to obtain event correlations, entity correlations, and partial event-entity correlations respectively. Second, a com-plete event-entity correlation is estimated by a Multi-correlation Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (MPMF), which is an ex-tended version of traditional Probabilistic Matrix Factoriza-tion (PMF) [23] with additional consideration of the with-in item correlations, i.e., the event correlation and the en-tity correlation. Third, the result ranking and visualization are conducted to present news searching results. Different from a typical news browser, which only presents a rank-ing list of relevant news items, we will additionally provide user a query-oriented multi-correlation map as an intuitive and concise resulting presentation. Experimental results on a news dataset collected from multiple sources demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MMPNR framework.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief review of related work. Section 3 gives an overview of our news retrieval system. Section 4 presents the correlation initialization using multi-modal analysis. We in-troduce the proposed MPMF model to complete and refine the three correlations in Section 5. Section 6 gives the re-sult ranking and visualization in MMPNR. Section 7 shows our evaluation of the methods using a large news article set and discusses our analysis of the results in detail. Section 8 concludes this paper.
The task of relation extraction has been traditionally stud-ied as to extract predefined semantic relations between pairs of entities in text. The supervised methods [30, 11, 32, 10] require a set of labeled training examples of the predefined relations to learn an extractor. However, the labeled ex-amples are scarce and expensive. The bootstrapping ap-proaches [4, 1, 33, 8] relax the requirement on training data through iteratively discovering extraction patterns and iden-tifying entity relations with a small number of seeds. Based on bootstrapping methods, some bootstrapping systems [4, 1, 33] have been explored. Brin [4] extracted many author-title relationships from the Web by matching phrases, sup-posing that a syntactic pattern corresponded to a relation. Similar to Brin X  X , the well-known Snowball [1] employed the pattern-entity duality to iteratively extract specific relation-ships from the Web. Taking Snowball as the basis, Zhu et al. [33] produced a system named StatSnowball, which signifi-cantly improved the retrieval performance on recall and pre-cision. It used the general discriminative Markov logic net-works, which subsumed logistic regression and conditional random fields, weights each pattern by maximum likelihood estimation, and can be configured to perform open infor-mation extraction (OpenIE) [2]. StatSnowball can perform joint inference by using the Markov logic networks, while the O-CRFs [3] treat sentences independently. Probabilistic relation model [9, 18] has been proposed to estimate the re-lations among entities. Relational techniques such as PRMs [9] extended generative methods to deal with various combi-nations of probabilistic dependency among entities. Such mehods can be computationally expensive, and may not scale to the large amount of data typically collected by so-cial media websites. Some work focus on relational learning methods [18] through pairwise relationships among entities, which involve loss of information when data has high-order interactions.

Sekine et al. [25] proposed 150 types of named entity, which were useful in information extraction and Question and Answering (Q&amp;A) in the newspaper domain. KnowItAll [7, 8, 26] is a system for automating the tedious process to extract large collections of facts from the web, which is based on generic extraction rules to generate candidates, co-occurrence statistic, and a naive Bayes classifier. It learned an effective pattern to extract relevant entities from relevant and irrelevant terms for expected entities. It found entity names in the same class as a given example by using several syntactic patterns. However, it required large numbers of search queries and downloaded web pages.

Event detection from news articles has been extensively studied. There are some approaches based on clustering [22, 29, 24]. Naughton et al. [22] discovered clusters at sentence level using hierarchical algorithms and regarded that each cluster pointed to an event with assumption that a news article could point to different events. Yang et al. [29] pro-posed an agglomerative clustering algorithm, in which the similarities between the incoming document and the known events were computed and a threshold was applied to make a decision. A new model was proposed in [24] to detect news events using a label based clustering approach. A unique thinking was proposed in [31], where the authors distinguished the concepts of relevance and redundancy. A probabilistic model [15] attempted to identify events within a corpus of historical news articles with the help of time information, user feedback, and content information.
Factor analysis [27] has been widely utilized in many fields [34, 12, 20, 21, 23, 19, 5, 16]. Zhu et al. [34] proposed a joint matrix factorization combining both linkage and document-term matrices to improve the hypertext classification. The content information and link strictures were seamlessly com-bined through a single set of latent factors. The discov-ered latent factors (bases) explained both content informa-tion and link structures, and were used to classify the web Figure 2: The framework of the proposed MMPNR. pages. A variety of probabilistic factor-based models have been proposed [12, 20, 21], which can be viewed as graph-ical models in which latent factor variables have directed connections to variables that represent user ratings. The major drawback is that potentially slow or inaccurate ap-proximations are required for the estimation of the poste-rior distribution over latent factors. Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) [23] was proposed to find only point estimates of model parameters and hypermeters, instead of inferring the full posterior distribution over them. It mod-els the user-item matrix as a product of two low-rank user and item matrices. The computation cost of PDF is linear with the number of observations. A social recommenda-tion has been proposed based on the probabilistic matrix factorization model, named as SoRec [19]. It fused the user-item matrix with the users X  social trust networks by sharing a common latent low-dimensional user feature matrix. A probabilistic polyadic factor model [5] was proposed to an-alyze multiple-dimensional data such as networked data in social networks and directly model all the dimensions si-multaneously in a unified framework. In order to discover community structure from various social contexts and inter-actions, MetaFac (MetaGraph Factorization) [16] proposed an efficient factorization approach through analyzing time-varying and multi-relational data.

To make full use of the within-and inter-correlations among events and entities, in this paper, we propose a MPMF model to learn the person latent space and the event latent space by exploring the three correlation matrices simultane-ously and seamlessly. Based on the reconstructed correla-tions over the latent spaces, we provide users a concise and informative result browsing with a query-oriented correla-tion map and a ranking list of news items. As far as we know, the proposed MPMF-based news retrieval is the first one attempting to mine the within-and inter-correlations among events and entities in a simultaneous and seamless form.
In this section, we will briefly overview the framework of the proposed MMPNR (shown in Figure 2), which in-cludes four components, namely data preprocessing, corre-lation initialization, correlation reconstruction, and result ranking and visualization.

First, we collect and preprocess news data. A large scale of news articles are crawled from some distinguished news sites including ABCNews.com 1 , BBC.co.uk 2 and CNN.com 3 . We first parse these news articles into news titles, summaries, texts, URLs and images of news pages. Necessary text pre-processing including word separation and stop-words filter-ing are conducted. Then we extract news entities (Time, Person or Organization, and Location) according to [25]. In this paper, we view Person (or Organization)as entities, while the time and location are used to identify news events.
The second component introduced in Section 4 aims to initialize three kinds of correlations: the event correlation, the person correlation, and the person-event correlation. In particular, the event correlation is estimated via the TF-IDF model on text information (news title, summary, and details) from news web pages. For the person correlation, a linear combination of the two co-occurrences of person name entities within text information and faces on person images respectively. We utilize the occurrence of a specific person in an event to obtain a binary relationship between the person and the event.

The third component is the basic component in MMPNR, which is demonstrated in Section 5. We apply the multi-correlation probabilistic matrix factorization model to mine the hidden relations. We connect these three different cor-relations simultaneously and seamlessly through the shared person latent feature space and event latent feature space, that is, the person latent feature space in the news person relational matrix is the same in the person-event correla-tion matrix and the event latent feature space in the news event similarity matrix is the same in the person-event cor-relation matrix. By performing factor analysis via MPMF, the low-dimension person latent features and event latent features are learned, which can be used to reconstruct the news person-event correlations.

The fourth component described in Section 6 is the re-sult ranking and visualization in MMPNR, which obtains and displays query-related search results to the end users. To give users vivid and informative organization of news re-sults, we divide the user interface into two parts. The left part gives users a query-oriented relation graph, in which the relations between the query and events (or persons) are illustrated. In the right part, we present a ranking list of related news events with their titles, and the most relevant persons and events respectively.
In this section, we will explain how to estimate the three correlations from multi-modal information on news web pages. The estimated correlations is viewed as the initialized inputs of the MPMF model, which will be introduced in Section 5. The details about the estimation are presented as follows.
As mentioned above, we employ the binary relationship to measure the person-event correlation R , that is, if a news person i appears in a news event j , R ij = 1 and R ij = 0 http://abcnews.go.com/ http://www.bbc.co.uk/ http://edition.cnn.com/ otherwise. Because the amount of online news articles is too large, the person-event relation matrix R is very sparse, which is one of the reasons we employ the probabilistic ma-trix factorization model.
From the aspect of utilizing the contents, TF-IDF is still the dominant technique to represent document, and cosine similarity is the generally used similarity metric. Therefore, we adopt the TF-IDF model and cosine similarity to mea-sure the news event similarity matrix S . Considering the difference of the importance of news article X  X  title, summary and text to a news event, we process them separately and linearly combine them. Besides, the information of title is the most important to the news event and the information of summary is more important than the information of text to the news event. In our experiments, we combine these three kinds of similarities as where S , S title , S summary and S text represent the similarity of event, title, summary and text, respectively.
In view of current news web pages containing images and persons always appearing in images of news articles, we are supposed to utilize not only the text information, but also the information of images to calculate the co-occurrence of people in news events. Thus, we combine the text informa-tion and the image information to calculate the relationship between news person and event. First, we use the formula C iq = 2 f ( i; q ) = ( f ( i )+ f ( q )) to calculate the co-occurrence based on the textual information, where f ( i; q ), f ( i ) and f ( q ) denote the number of news articles including person i and person q simultaneously, the count of news articles containing person i , and the count of news articles con-taining person q , respectively. We apply the face detection and matching methods to process the information of image, which will be explained in detail as follows. We employ the same formula to calculate the co-occurrence based on the image information C Img iq .

We first submit names of persons to Wikipedia 4 , crawl and parse the corresponding returned web pages, and download images in the resume tables. And then we adopt the face detection approaches to detect the face parts in images.To determine whether a specific person appears in the news im-ages or not, we adopt SIFT flow [17] to match the face part of the specific person X  X  image from Wikipedia with any face part detected in the image from news web page. An illus-trate example is given in Figure 3. The face parts (b), which are the face parts of images derived by submitting persons X  names in (a), are used to be matched with the face parts in image (c) from news web pages. The matched results by SIFT flow algorithm are presented in (c). According to the matching results, we can derive the image co-occurrence matrix as shown in (d).

The SIFT flow approach assumes SIFT descriptors ex-tracted at each pixel location are constant with respect to the pixel displacement field and allows a pixel in one image to match any other pixel in the other image. We still want to encourage smoothness of the pixel displacement field by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main Page Figure 3: An illustrate example of face detection and matching. (a) the names of news persons; (b) the faces detected in images crawled from Wikipedia by submitting names in (a); (c) the face matching results; (d) the co-occurrence matrix based on (c). The red, green, blue and yellow boxes represent \Barack Obama ", \Michelle Obama ", \Joy Biden" and \Jill Biden", respectively. encouraging close-by pixels to have similar displacements. It formulates the correspondence search as a discrete opti-mization problem on the image lattice with the following cost function l ( w ) = + where w ( p ) = ( u ( p ) ; v ( p )) is the displacement vector at pixel location p = ( x; y ), s i ( p ) is the SIFT descriptor ex-tracted at location p in image i and q is the spatial neighbor-hood of a pixel. Parameters = 300, = 0 : 5 and d = 2 are fixed in our experiments. Based on the results of matching, we decide whether a person emerges in the news images. Finally, we obtain an indicator matrix with each column representing whether a news person appears in news images or not. We statistic term frequency and calculate the co-occurrence similar to text processing. We linearly integrate these two co-occurrences as follows:
Through the initializing component, we have accomplished the preparation for the following correlation reconstruction i.e., the complement and refinement of the initialized cor-relations. For clarity, we first introduce the standard PMF model. Then, we present our proposed MPMF model with additional consideration of the within correlations about events and entities respectively. Figure 4: Graphical model for Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF).
PMF model [23] was proposed to handle very large, sparse, and imbalanced dataset in collaborative filtering, based on the assumption that users who have rated similar sets of movies are likely to have similar preferences. Following, let us take collaborative filtering for example to illustrate the probabilistic matrix factorization model.

In order to learn the characteristic of the users, matrix factorization is employed to factorize the user-item matrix. Suppose we have m users, n movies, and the rating values within the interval [0, 1]. If the rating values are integer from 1 to Q (a bigger integer value more than 1, such as 3 and 5), we can map the ratings 1 ; :::; Q to the internal [0, 1] using the function h ( x ) = ( x  X  1) = ( Q  X  1). Let R note the rating of user i for movie j , R  X  R m n denote the rating matrix. The basic idea of probabilistic matrix fac-torization is to derive two high-quality d -dimensional ( d is lower than min( m; n ) : ) latent feature spaces P  X  R d m E  X  R d n , which denote the latent user and movie feature spaces respectively. The column vectors P i and E j repre-sent user-specific and movie-specific latent feature vectors, which are not unique. A probabilistic model with Gaussian observation noise is employed as shown in Figure 4, and the conditional distribution over the observed rating is defined as: where N ( x | ; 2 ) denotes the probabilistic density function, in which the conditional distribution is defined as the Gaus-sian distribution with mean and variance 2 , and I ij is the indicator function that is equal to 1 if user i rated movie j and equal to 0 otherwise. The function g ( x ) is a logistic function defined as g ( x ) = 1 = (1 + exp (  X  x )), which makes it possible to bound the range of P T i E j within the interval [0, 1]. As described in [6, 28], zero-mean spherical Gaussian priors are placed on user and movie feature vectors: where I is an identity matrix.

Through a Bayesian inference, the posterior distribution over the user and movie features is given by: p ( P;E | R; 2 R ; 2 P ; 2 E )  X  p ( R | P; E; 2 R ) p ( P Thus, we can derive the log of the posterior distribution given by Eq. 6, described as: where C is a constant that does not depend on the param-eters. Maximizing the log-posterior distribution over user and movie features given by Eq. 7 with hyperparameters (i. e. the observation noise variance and prior variances) kept fixed is equivalent to minimizing the following sum-of-squared-errors objective functions with quadratic regular-ization terms: in which p = 2 R = 2 P , E = 2 R = 2 E , and  X  X  X  X  2 F denotes the Frobenius norm. Eq. 8 can be solved using gradient meth-ods, such as the conjugate gradient, quasi-Newton methods and steepest descent method. Through performing gradient descent in P and E as described in Eq. 9 and Eq. 10, we can find a local minimum of the objective function given by Eq. 8. g exp ( x )) 2 .

The experimental results in [23] demonstrate that proba-bilistic matrix factorization performs very well on the very large, sparse and imbalanced dataset and takes time linear in the number of observations using steepest descent. The graphical model shown in Figure 4 represents the method how to derive the users latent feature spaces based on the user-item matrix without considering the users X  social net-work and the items X  similarities. In the next subsection, we will propose an algorithm to integrate the user-item matrix, users X  social network and items X  similarity matrix simulta-neously and seamlessly.
In the problem of our person-centric news retrieval, we consider two issues: news person and event. We can have three kinds of relations: person-event correlation, person correlation and event correlation. The person-event relation in the problem of person-centric news retrieval can be anal-ogous to user-item relation in recommender system. Fur-thermore, due to the fast explosion of online news articles, the correlations among news persons and news events are usually very sparse. The probabilistic matrix factorization algorithm as a natural and feasible option is employed to conduct our work. However, the standard probabilistic ma-trix factorization model can only employ one relation. Then we extend the model to integrate the news person correla-tion and news event correlation, named as Multi-correlation Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (MPMF). We employ the probabilistic factor analysis to factorize person-event corre-lation matrix, person correlation matrix and event correla-tion matrix, and connect these three different data resources through the shared person latent feature space, that is, the person latent feature space in the person-event correlation matrix is the same in the person correlation space, and the shard event latent feature space, that is, the event latent feature space in the person-event correlation matrix is the same in the event correlation matrix.

To learn the person and event latent feature spaces, we model our problem using the graphical model described in Figure 5. Suppose we have m persons and n events. Let R  X  R m n , C  X  R m m and S  X  R n n denote the person-event relation matrix, person correlation matrix and event similarity matrix respectively. Let R ij represent the relation of person i and event j within the range [0, 1], C iq  X  [0 ; 1] denote the relation between person i and person q , and S jk  X  [0 ; 1] denote the similarity between event j and event k . Let P  X  R d m , E  X  R d n , X  X  R d m and Z  X  R d n be person, event, person factor and event factor latent feature matrices, with column vectors P i , E j , X q and Z k represent-ing person-specific, event-specific, person factor-specific and event factor-specific latent feature vectors, respectively.
The probabilistic model with Gaussian observation noise is adopted and the conditional distributions are defined as: where I R ij is the indicator function that is equal to 1 if the relation between news person i and news event j is more than 0 and equal to 0 otherwise. I C iq and I S jk are defined similarly.

We also place zero-mean spherical Gaussian priors on per-son, event, person factor and event factor feature vectors.
Hence, similar to Eq. 7, through a simple Bayesian infer-ence, we can obtain the log of the posterior distribution: ln p ( P; E;X; Z | R; C; S; 2 R ; 2 C ; 2 S ; 2 P ; 2 As described above, the equivalent optimization problem is to minimize the following objective function:
L ( P; E; X;Z ) = 1 of the objective function given by Eq. 19 can be found by performing gradient descent in P i , E j , X q and Z k , respec-tively. @L To reduce the model complexity, in all of our experiments, we set P = E = X = Z .
Provided with the latent feature spaces by MPMF, we can give users more information than the traditional news engines, which can only present the list of related news arti-cles. Figure 6 gives the interface of our MMPNR system. It presents the discovered relations and the relative news events to the end users in a visualized view. Basically, it comprises two types of views: relation view and relative event view.
In the relation view, we give users three relations to an-swer their queries: person relation, event relation and query person-event relation. In the person relation part, we present a social network about the most relevant persons, which enables users to explore highly relevant information during searching to discover interesting relationships about persons associated with their queries. We also show users a news event relation map about the most related events in the event relation part. Through MPMF, we have got the latent spaces P , E , X and Z , which can be utilized to reconstruct the three correlation matrices by the following formulas: If user submits a query corresponding to the person i in our dataset, we can rank persons and events by sorting the i -th column of  X  C and  X  R by descending order. We can also derive the relevant events to the query from the matrix  X  S . We only present the top 10 relevant persons in the social network and the top 10 relevant events in the news event relation map. As shown in the left part of Figure 6, we give names and face images of persons and keywords of events. The weighted edges between persons or events denote the relations be-tween them. The thicker the line between persons or events, the stronger the relation they have. The query person-event view shows the relations between the relative news events and the query person using weighted edges. Users can also see the detailed information about a specific event or person through putting the mouse pointer on the suitable position.
In the relative events view, as done in a traditional news searcher, we also present a ranking list of relative news events with general introduction. We present news event not only with the title and a shot part of summary simi-lar to the traditional news searcher, but also with the top 3 relevant persons and the top 3 relevant news events, which can be obtained by sorting the reconstructed event correla-tion matrix  X  S . Users can browse more information through clicking the title of events.
The objective of our experiments is to examine the ef-fectiveness of our proposed models in person-centric news retrieval. we first explain the data set we collected for our evaluation, the metrics, and the parameter setting in our ex-periments. Then we present the experimental results using our algorithm as well as its comparison with other methods.
Our experiments are performed on a web news dataset, in which news articles were crawled from ABCNews.com, BBC.co.uk and CNN.com. Two news articles are considered to be duplicate when they correspond to the same news event according to the  X 4W X  criterion. With the crawled news articles, we first remove the duplicate ones and conduct the evaluation on the deduplicated dataset. That is, one news article stands for a news event in our experiments. We got 99,885 articles in total, whose distribution over the three websits is shown in Table 1. In addition, we extracted 9,345 persons X  names as the entities from the news dataset after deleting the ones which appear less than 10 times. Number of articles 47,163 11,073 41,649 99,885
Similar to previous work on information retrieval, we adopt normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) [13] as a measure to evaluate the effectiveness of web search algo-rithm, which is defined as DCG (Discounted Cumulative Gain) is to measure the cu-mulative gain of the resulting documents on its position and IDCG is the ideal discounted cumulative gain vector. At last, nDCG values for all queries can be averaged to obtain a measure of the average performance of a ranking algorithm.
No well-defined ground-truth dataset can be used to eval-uate the performance of news retrieval. Thus, we invite a group of ten people to judge the relevance of searching re-sults. As defined in Table 2, the participators can present three types of graded relevance, which is used in the calcu-lation of nDCG. The specific task of each participator is to randomly select ten queries from the query list as shown in Table 3 to search news information and evaluate the perfor-mance according to our predefined evaluating criterions.
There are some parameters to be set in advance. We set = 0 : 5, = 0 : 3, = 0 : 4, P = E = X = Z = 0 : 001,
C = 10, S = 25 and d = 100. The initial values for P are set by Random Acol [14] through averaging 1,000 columns randomly chosen from R . The matrices E , X and Z are initialized similarly.

We perform the experimental comparisons among six re-trieval systems. They are MMPNR considering both per-son correlation and event correlation (our proposed system), MMPNR-Text only employing text information in correla-tion initialization, EPMF only considering event correla-tion, PPMF only considering person correlation, and PMF with no consideration of the both correlations. Additionally, Google News search engine 5 is employed as a baseline in the comparison.

In the first experiment, the participators were asked to search on the six systems to give scores about the relevance to queries as shown in Table 2. The ranking quality is mea-sured using the average nDCG@ k for k from 1 to 10. Figure 7 presents the average scores on the top 10 events returned for each query. Figure 8 presents the corresponding gains of ranking quality over baseline. From Figure 7 and Figure 8, we can draw the following observations. First, all the fac-tor analysis based methods achieve the superior effectiveness over Google News, which only considers the text relevance to a given query. Among these, the proposed MMPNR achieves the best performance by simultaneously employing the three correlations and multi-modal information analysis. Second, the worse performance is achieved by MMPNR-Text com-pared with MMPNR. This demonstrates that the process of face detection and matching is useful in the entity cor-relation initialization. Third, with additional consideration of entity (or event) correlation, PPMF (or EPMF) obtains more attractive performance than PMF. Fourth, PMF is better than Google news when K is no less than 4, because PMF is able to find more relevant results by mining hidden correlations between entities and events. However, when K is less than 4, i.e., the top 1-3 returned results is considered, a little worse performance is obtain by PMF compared with Google News. It is understandable because Google News adopt a more comprehensive ranking strategy (e.g., PageR-ank and log analysis in search) to measure the query-oriented relevance. http://news.google.com/ Figure 9: Impact of Parameter C on MMPNR Second, we evaluate our system from a subjective view. While browsing results of the ten queries, each participator was asked to give a score within the interval [1, 5] (the big-ger the score, the better the result) based on the following aspects:
The average scores are shown in Figure 11. It is obvious that users prefer the interface of our system and our sys-tem can give relevant and various results conveniently and efficiently. Additionally, the users are satisfied with the pre-sented social network and the relevant event map, which demonstrates the MPMF model is effective to mine the hid-den relationships. Additionally, our system is useful and convenient for user to understand news events.

In summary, the above experiments demonstrate that our system is able to mine more relations and give users multi-view relations. They can more easily understand the news events and obtain more information about their queries.
The main advantage of our person-centric news retrieval is that it incorporates the social network information and event correlation information. In our model, parameters C and S balance the information from the person-event re-lation matrix, person social network and event correlation matrix. If C = 0 (or S = 0), it is equivalent to EPMF Figure 10: Impact of Parameter S on MMPNR Figure 11: The average scores of the subjective eval-uation (or PPMF), respectively. Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the impacts of C (while holding S = 25 fixed) and S (while holding C = 10 fixed) on nDCG@10 respectively, which demonstrate that the values of C and S impact the re-sults. As C increases, the average nDCG@10 increases at first, but when C surpasses a certain threshold, the aver-age nDCG@10 decreases with further increase of the value of C . The impact of parameter S is similar to C . This phenomenon coincides with the intuition that purely using the person-event relation matrix, the person social network or the event correlation matrix can not generate better per-formance that fusing these three sources.
In this paper, we propose a news retrieval approach based on multi-modal analysis and multi-correlation exploration. We explore the information of both text and correspond-ing images for the initialization of entity correlation. In particular, we adopt statistical co-occurrences in the two modalities to derive the news entity correlations. To fully employ the multi-correlation information, we proposed a Multi-correlation Probabilistic Matrix Factorization model (MPMF) to analyze news entity correlation, news event cor-relation and entity-event correlation. The proposed MPMF model explores the three correlations simultaneously to rank news events and news persons relevant to a given query. We build a news retrieval system named MMPNR (Multi-modal Multi-correlation Person-centric News Retrieval) based on it. The reasonable and comprehensive evaluations are per-formed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.
The MPMF model opens a broad way for future improve-ment and extension. As part of future work, we will investi-gate the following directions: (i) kernel based representation for the two low-dimensional vectors; (ii) considering the in-formation diffusion between persons (events). We believe they would lead us to more promising results.
