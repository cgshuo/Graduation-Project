 ORIGINAL PAPER Farnood Merrikh-Bayat  X  Massoud Babaie-Zadeh  X  Christian Jutten Abstract Digital documents are usually degraded during the scanning process due to the contents of the backside of the scanned manuscript. This is often caused by the show-through effect, i.e. the backside image that interferes with the main front side picture due to the intrinsic transparency of the paper. This phenomenon is one of the degradations that one would like to remove especially in the field of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or document digita-lization which require denoised texts as inputs. In this paper, we first propose a novel and general nonlinear model for canceling the show-through phenomenon. A nonlinear blind source separation algorithm is used for this purpose based on a new recursive and extendible structure. However, the results are restricted due to a blurring effect that appears during the scanning process due to the light transfer function of the paper. Consequently, for improving the results, we introduce a refined separating architecture for simultaneously remov-ing the show-through and blurring effects.
 Keywords Show-through reduction  X  Blind source separation  X  Linear-quadratic  X  Blurring effect 1 Introduction Archives usually need automatic methods for improving the readability of the digital versions of the ancient or printed documents. This processing is also recommended for the applications concerned with the production of the machine-readable digital document from ancient handwriting for example by using character recognition algorithms; these algorithms require clean versions of the original documents. In this paper, we consider one of the most common degrada-tions, usually appearing in ancient documents that are writ-ten or printed on both sides of the page: this phenomenon is generally called print-through. Print-through is an undesired appearance of a printed image or text of the reverse side of the paper and can be divided into three additive components, each of them corresponding to a physical phenomenon [ 1 ]:  X  The show-through component related to the paper X  X   X  The pigment penetration component;  X  The vehicle oil component, which is related to the loss of
When the ink of the printer does not penetrate the paper considerably, effects of pigment penetration and of vehicle oil are negligible and print-through can be approximated only by show-through. Show-through can significantly impair the readability of the document and also cause visual fatigue for the reader. When the show-through degradation is significant (the darkness of the show-through is comparable to, or even greater than, that of some parts of the desired writing), then it is practically impossible to remove show-through by only using a simple thresholding operation.
Several approaches for show-through reduction have been already investigated. In [ 2 , 3 ], the authors used various features in the document for distinguishing show-through from the foreground image and presented show-through removal techniques involving only one side of the document. Although these methods certainly perform better than simple thresholding, there is no way to unambiguously differentiate foreground from show-through without comparing both sides of the document especially in grayscale images. Other works process both sides of the document simultaneously, in order to identify regions that are mainly show-through, and replace them by an estimate of the background [ 4 , 5 ]. Most of these works deal with only text or handwriting, and the original images are degraded after the show-through removal proce-dure. Recent investigations are applying Blind Source Sepa-ration (BSS) algorithms for solving this problem. In [ 6 , 7 ], the authors assume that the show-through effect can be modeled by linear superimposition of the back and front sides. Then, the scanned front-side image (corrupted by the backside) and the scanned back-side image (corrupted by the frontside) are linear mixtures of the pure front and back images, assumed to be independent, which can be estimated by BSS tech-niques. Tonazzini et al. in [ 8 ] represent an effective method for removing show-through in color images by using only one side of the paper. However, the method is not appli-cable for grayscale images. Although these methods give good results, the results are not perfect especially in regions where the images of the front and back sides of the paper overlap and the front side X  X  image is nearly black. In such regions, the recovered front image is whiter than other sec-tions where there is no overlap. The main reason of these poor results is that show-through is a nonlinear effect as we will show in the next section, and as it has also been previ-ously considered and modeled, e.g. in [ 9 ]. Sharma in [ 10 ] considered a nonlinear model for this phenomenon and pro-posed to compensate for this effect by using adaptive filters. The main disadvantage of using adaptive filters, as we will see later, is that the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the out-puts cannot be more than the noise to signal ratio of the input images (due to the power inversion property in adaptive fil-ters [ 11 , page 78]). Castro et al. [ 12 ] used fuzzy classifica-tion for detecting degraded sections of the input images. The proposed algorithm is fully dependent on the specific appli-cation (only applicable to ancient music notes) and suffers from disadvantages of fuzzy classification. Moreover, they did not consider the blurring effect that we will point out in Sect. 4.1 . By taking into account the nonlinearity of show-through, Almeida used in [ 13 ] the MISEP method based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks for separating the real-world nonlinear image mixtures. The main drawback of using these kinds of  X  X niversal nonlinear networks X  for BSS is the separability issue: the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) does not necessarily lead to BSS using such networks. Note that based on the way that the show-through phenomenon is modeled, this or other nonlinear BSS tech-niques [ 14  X  17 ] may be applicable for solving this problem. In fact, finding a suitable BSS method for separating the show-through from the original sources based on the acquired model is one of the main goals of this paper.
 Here, it is worth to mention that, although there are some Markov Random Field (MRF)-based show-through removal methods [ 18 , 19 ], in this paper, we only focus on BSS-based algorithms. This is because of the fact that in the framework of BSS, considering MRF nature of images requires one to take into account the joint distribution of neighbor pixels, which leads to very tricky estimation problems and very cost-consuming algorithms. In fact, the Markovian nature has already been considered in BSS, for instance by Hosseini et al. [ 20 ]. In addition in the framework of hyperspectral pro-cessing, it has been shown that MRF and BSS, although based on different properties, lead to very similar results [ 21 ].
In this paper, we first show that show-through is a non-linear phenomenon and introduce a nonlinear model based on experiments. Then, we show that, in addition to nonlin-ear mixing models, we have to take into account a blurring effect. Our method is derived from the nonlinear BSS recur-sive structure presented by Hosseini and Deville [ 22 , 23 ], in which we add refinements for jointly compensating for the degradation caused by show-through and blurring effects, as it will be demonstrated by some simulation results. Although the principles and preliminary results have briefly been pre-sented in [ 24 ], the current paper, both in theoretical and exper-imental parts, contains many new extensions.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 , we exper-imentally show that show-through is a nonlinear phenome-non and introduce our nonlinear model. Section 3 describes a basic blind separation structure for dealing with this nonlin-ear model. The blurring effect and the usage of adaptive filters for its compensation, and the combination of these filters with the non-linear BSS structure are developed in Sect. 4 . Finally, a few experimental results with real and artificial printed or manuscript documents are presented in Sect. 5 , before the conclusions and perspectives of Sect. 6 . 2 Show-through nonlinear modeling Show-through appears when a fraction of the verso is mixed with the recto pixel by pixel in the scanning process. How-ever, as we will demonstrate in this section, this fraction is proportional to the grayscale of the front image, i.e. as the front image becomes darker, the show-through will be lower. Therefore, the mixing model cannot be linear. Figure 1 illus-trates this claim based on an experiment explained below.
In this experiment, the two images shown in Fig. 1 aare first printed on the two sides of a sheet of paper and then scanned as illustrated in Fig. 1 b. Then, the grayscales of the pixels on two scanning lines shown in Fig. 1 b (solid line in the region with show-through and dashed line in the region without show-through) are plotted in Fig. 1 c. It is obvious in this figure that as the front image becomes darker, the difference between the pixels with show-through and the pixels without show-through decreases with the pixel value. This demonstrates that the appearance of the show-through in the scanned image depends on the grayscale of the front image of the paper. This means that the gain by which the backside image is added to the front side image is variable, and it is proportional to the brightness of the image printed on the front side of the paper. We model this variable gain at any pixel of the scanned image of the front side of the paper by g 1 f i r ( m , n ) and at any pixel of the back side by g resent the dependency of the mentioned gain to the pixel values of the front side and back side images, respectively.
Therefore, we model the show-through effect and its dependency to the grayscale of the front image as f ( m , n ) = a f ( m , n ) = a where  X  m and n are the 2-D spatial coordinates on the paper  X  the subscript r is related to the front side (recto),  X  the subscript v is related to the back side (verso),  X  the superscript i denotes the ideal (without show- X  the superscript s denotes the scanned image (having  X  the function g  X  and f (., .) denotes a 2-D signal (image).

Note that if the function g i is cancelled, (i.e. if g i (  X  ) = Eq. ( 1 ) becomes a simple linear mixing model. Since the scanning process of both sides of a paper is symmetric and usually done under the same conditions, in [ 6 ] it has been assumed that a 1 = a 2 , b 1 = b 2 and g 1 (  X  ) = g 2 (  X  ) = (because in [ 6 ] the authors assumed the model was linear). However, in this paper and for preserving the generality of our nonlinear model as much as possible, we only assume that the nonlinear functions g 1 and g 2 have the same shape. By rewriting ( 1 ) we obtain f f v ( m , n )  X  a 2 f i v ( m , n ) where is a small positive number inserted to avoid divi-sion by zero. Note that adding is useful only if b 1 f i v never becomes negative. b 1 f i v ( m , n ) is the attenuated back-side image which appears in the scanned image of the front side of the paper. Since in the scanned image it is possible to see the same image of the backside of the paper (and not its negative), it means that b 1 f i v ( m , n ) has been added and not subtracted from the image of the front side of the paper and therefore, b 1 f i v ( m , n ) is nonnegative. For another rea-side and backside printed images are white (have pixel values near 255), the scanned image should be nearly black which equation in ( 2 )versus f i r ( m , n ) for particular images hav-ing show-through, it is possible to draw the general shape of the function g i (  X  ) . As an experiment, we used images were printed on sides of a sheet of paper and then were scanned. By choosing these images, we are sure that in the final scanned pictures, we have all possible combinations of grayscales.

Figure 3 shows the plot of g 1 ( f i r ( m , n )) versus f Note that for plotting this image, parameters a 1 and b 1 needed. Since in this experiment, we have the original pure unknown and by using Eq. ( 1 ), they can be estimated from the images used for performing this simulation. For example, a can be approximated by comparing f i r ( m , n ) and f s r where there is no image printed on the backside. Similarly, b 1 can be estimated by comparing f i v where this time, there is no image printed on the front side. Based on Fig. 3 , we propose to model the function g i ( u an exponential function g i ( u ) =  X  i e  X  i u for i = 1  X  and  X  i are constant. This model implies that as the front image becomes whiter, the backside image will be added to the front image with a higher gain. Note that if show-through was a linear phenomenon then g would be a constant, i.e. a horizontal line in Fig. 3 .

By replacing g 1 (  X  ) by  X  1 e  X  1 (  X  ) in ( 1 ) we get f ( m , n ) = a where b 1 = b 1  X   X  1 . Equation ( 3 ) can be simplified by replacing the exponential function by its first order Taylor expansion. As it will be seen in the experimental results, this approximation works well. Moreover, the experiments also show that  X  1 is usually small for documents having show-through, which is consistent with the first order expansion. This can also be justified by Fig. 3 , which shows that g is close to being linear, i.e.  X  1 is small. Using this approxima-tion, we obtain f ( m , n )  X  a where d 1 = b 1  X   X  1 . Similar to ( 4 ), the scanned image of the back side can be written as v ( m , n ) = a 2 f i v ( m , n ) + b 2 f i r ( m , n )  X  Finally, since the gains a 1 and a 2 are undetermined, Eqs. ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) can be simplified as follows [ 22 , 23 ]: f ( m , n ) = f i f ( m , n ) = f i v ( m , n )  X  l
For separating the sources in the above model, we first have to find the mixing coefficients and then to solve the nonlinear system of Eq. ( 6 ) numerically. This will be done using nonlinear BSS techniques, as explained in the next sections. 3 Basic linear-quadratic blind source separation structure The nonlinear model ( 6 ) actually is a linear-quadratic (or bilinear) mixing model, whose blind separation has already been addressed by Hosseini and Deville [ 22 , 23 ] based on the recurrent separating structure of Fig. 4 , which is inspired from the early work of H X rault and Jutten [ 25 ]. Note that (i) by setting q 1 = 0 and q 2 = 0in( 7 ) and in Fig. 4 ,this structure is reduced to the basic linear network proposed by H X rault and Jutten and (ii) this structure has the capability to be generalized to arbitrary polynomial models [ 22 , 23 ].
The computation of the outputs of the structure requires the realization of the following recurrent iterative expression y y where t is the iteration index. It has been shown in [ 26 ] that the necessary and sufficient condition for local stability of this model at the separating point ( y 1 , y 2 ) = f i r , the absolute values of the two eigenvalues of J 1 be smaller than one where J 1 is the Jacobian matrix of ( 7 )at f i v By defining s 1 = f s r ( m , n ) and s 2 = f s v ( m , n matrix can be written as J and its eigenvalues are  X 
The Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimate of the parame-rule p where L denotes the likelihood of p based on the given sam-of the mixing model ( 6 ),  X  L  X  p can be written as [ 22 , 23 ]:  X

In ( 11 ), E denotes the spatial averaging operation on all of the samples and  X  i (  X  ), i = 1 , 2 are the score func-tions [ 22 , 23 ] of the source images (original images without show-through, i.e. f i r and f i v ).

Here, it is worth mentioning that as explained and proved in [ 22 , 23 ], the linear-quadratic mixing model of ( 6 )isnot bijective in general. Consequently, the recurrent structure shown in Fig. 4 has two equilibrium points corresponding to a non-permuted solution and a permuted one, while only one of them is stable. Moreover, if the Jacobian of the mix-ing model, J 2 , is always positive or always negative for all of the values of the sources, the recurrent structure leads to the entirely permuted or entirely non-permuted sources for all of the image pixels and therefore, it can be used for separating the sources. On the other hand, if J 2 is positive for some values of the sources and negative for other values, the recurrent structure leads to the non-permuted sources for some image pixels and to the permuted sources for other pixels. In this case, although the sources are separated  X  X am-ple by sample X , each retrieved image contains samples of the two image sources. From the explanations provided in this section, it should become clear that the recurrent net-work generally may diverge in many cases. But fortunately, using this structure for show-through removal adds some con-straints (which come from the physics of the problem) on the sources and parameter values which can somehow relax this drawback. For example, since in this particular application, the sources are images, they can only have bounded non-negative values. In addition, by referring to ( 6 ) and con-sidering the explanations provided in the previous section about the signs of coefficients, e.g. b 1 and b 2 , it is clear that l and l 2 are always negative and their values are close to each other, i.e. l 1  X  l 2 (because of the symmetric nature of the scanning process in scanning two sides of the paper). More-over, we know that q 1  X  q 2 and both of them have a small positive value as will be seen in the experimental results. Applying these constraints to the aforementioned conditions may reduce the divergence probability of the recurrent struc-ture when it is used for this application.

Eventually, the show-through cancelation algorithm based on the structure of Fig. 4 can be summarized as follows: 1. align the front side and the back side scans by a regis-2. Initialize the structure of Fig. 4 with y ( t ) 1 , y ( 3. Apply the registered front and back side images to the 4. Compute the outputs of the structure, i.e. y 1 and y 2 5. Update the parameter vector p by iterating ( 10 ). Note 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until convergence is achieved (for
For experimentally validating this approach, we applied this structure and the algorithm of Hosseini and Deville [ 22 , 23 ] to the scanned image of Fig. 5 a and b. The result of the algorithm is shown in Fig. 5 c and d. The result proves a certain capability of the structure of Fig. 4 in removing show-through, but it also emphasizes residual errors, i.e. show-through is not perfectly canceled by the above non-linear model. 4 Adaptive linear-quadratic blind source separation structure In this section, we first explain that the poor results obtained with the previous nonlinear model can be due to a blurring effect. We then propose a new structure based on a modi-fication on the structure of Fig. 4 for jointly removing the show-through and blurring effects. 4.1 Blurring effect Figure 5 c and d show that the show-through has not been removed perfectly in regions where there is no text or image in one of the two sides.

In fact, during the scanning process, if the page is not com-pletely opaque and the scanner uses a white backing behind the page, the sensor of the scanner receives a light that is reflected from the backing and transmitted back through the paper. Thus, the light may scatter in different directions, espe-cially due to an unsmooth surface of the paper. This scattering phenomenon, which acts as a low-pass filter, is known as the blurring effect and some methods for its compensation have already been studied in the literatures [ 7 , 10 , 27 ]. How-ever, the blurring effect changes the nonlinear model that we considered previously. In fact, when scanning the recto, the scanned image is not a mixture of the front and back side images, but it is a mixture of the front side image and of the low-pass filtered image of the back side image . Clearly, this filtering cannot be canceled with the separating structure of Fig. 4 .

Therefore, to take into account the blurring effect in our model, we modify the show-through model of ( 6 )asfollows f f where  X  denotes the convolution operator, while H 1 and H are the point spread functions of the paper which are unknown. Therefore, the computation of the structure outputs requires the realization of the following recurrent iterative expression y y
Usually, as is confirmed by our simulations, q 1 and q are very small. Moreover, noting also that y ( t ) i and y although different, are in fact very similar, (only here and for illustrating the effectiveness of this new model by an exam-ple) we ignore the filtering operation in the quadratic part of ( 14 ), and we obtain [ 24 ]: y y
Figure 6 shows the structure associated with this recurrent iterative expression with fixed and known averaging filters. Here, we simplified the model and used fixed averaging fil-ters as an approximation of the point spread function of the paper only for demonstrating the excellence of this new con-figuration. The validity of this model will be illustrated by an experiment. Note that, as we used fixed and known filters and because of the similarities between y ( t ) i and y ( parameter vector p can be updated using equations derived in Sect. 3 . Figure 7 a and b show the results obtained by using this separating structure on images of Fig. 5 a and b. The results demonstrate the ability of this structure to reduce the blurring effect even by using these approximations.
Figure 7 c shows one of the outputs of the structure of Fig. 6 when it is configured as a linear separation structure (enforc-ing q 1 = 0 and q 2 = 0). An interesting part of the figure is magnified in Fig. 7 d to better understand the problem associ-ated with linear modeling of show-through. Arrows empha-size the whitening effect produced by using linear mixing models discussed in the introduction. This figure confirms that the averaging filters (in the structure of Fig. 6 ) are not sufficient and that a nonlinear modeling of show-through is required.

The disadvantage of using fixed filters (and the approxi-mations we did in the above experiment) is that it requires prior knowledge about the shape of these filters. In addition, especially in ancient documents and due to the heterogene-ity transparency of the paper, the filter can vary according to the location on the page. Therefore, it will be appropriate to determine the filter coefficients based on the actual shape of the point spread function of the paper which is propor-tional to the type of the paper. In this case, since the non-linear mixing model in ( 13 ) is different from ( 6 ), we must find a new way to estimate the parameter vector, p , and to find the coefficients of the filters, H 1 and H 2 . The nonlinear mixing model ( 13 ) is not an instantaneous mixture; there-fore, its blind separation is much more difficult. However, by adding some simplifying assumptions, it will be possible to estimate the shape of these filters as explained in the next subsection. 4.2 Estimating the shapes of the filters If we assume that show-through is a linear phenomenon (i.e. q 1 = q 2 = 0) and also assume that we are near the convergence which implies y ( t ) 1 | t  X  X  X  to be almost equal to f r (or f ( 14 ), then the filter coefficients (entries of H 1 and H be determined through the minimization of the following cost functions with respect to the filter coefficients (note that in these cost functions, f s r , f s v , f i v and f matrices) F F
These equations are inspired from ( 13 ) by setting q 1 and q to zero. In addition, it is worth mentioning that by consid-ering ( 13 ) and the fact that f i r and f i v are independent from each other, the minimum values of these two cost functions are equal to f i r and f i v respectively. However, since the orig-inal images f i v and f i r are unknown (actually it is our aim to determine them), it will be impossible to estimate the fil-ter coefficients accurately by this way. However, from the show-through model of ( 13 ), it is obvious that the amplitude of the filters can be changed by the parameter vector, p ,so it will be sufficient to only estimate the shape of these filters up to a gain indeterminacy. By considering the fact that, as the iteration number ( t ) increases, outputs of the structure are expected to be closer to the original independent sources, we propose to approximately estimate the shape of the filters in each iteration by minimizing the following cost functions
F
F
Note that we ignored the quadratic parts of the show-through model for estimating the shape of the filters because they are only used for modeling the nonlinearity of this phe-nomenon and therefore, have a weak contribution in the final scanned images (which means q 1 and q 2 have small values as we can check in the experimental results). Thus, using the linear model for show-through provides accurate enough estimation of the shape of the deblurring filters (point spread functions of the paper).

For minimizing the cost functions of the first equation in ( 17 ) with respect to the coefficients of the filter H used the adaptive structure shown in Fig. 8 . In this structure, for calculating the output in ( 14 ). A similar structure can be used for estimating H 2 . Figure 9 shows the final Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm for minimizing these cost functions and estimating the filter coefficients. To avoid divergence of the adaptive filters, the input images are normalized (such that they have zero mean with a unit variance) before being applied to the structure.

Since the SNR of e ( t ) 1 or e ( t ) 2 cannot be more than the noise to signal ratio of the input images (due to the power inversion property in adaptive filters) [ 11 , page 78], we cannot use this adaptive method by itself for separating the sources (as done by Sharma [ 10 ]), since it will not lead to good separation results. 4.3 The modified structure In the previous subsection, we proposed to use an adap-tive filter to estimate the point spread functions of the paper in each iteration. The new separating structure associated with ( 14 ) is shown in Fig. 10 . In this figure, each filtering block is the same as the adaptive filter detailed in Fig. 8 .In this structure and at each iteration, we apply first the algo-rithm shown in Fig. 9 to the output images of the struc-ture in the previous iteration. During the computation of also updated to be used in the next iteration. Then, using the current value of the parameter vector, the outputs of the structure are calculated for all of the input pixels through the recurrent iterative expression of ( 14 ). Finally, the param-eter vector of the structure is updated by using these new outputs. As we mentioned earlier, a new method should normally be introduced for updating the parameters vector in each iteration since we have changed the mixing model (compared to the show-through model represented in ( 6 ). However, because the effect of regions belonging to the blurring effect is small compared to the image itself, we propose to use the followings approximations: H 2  X  y ( t y 1 and H 1 updating the parameter vector of the structure of Fig. 4 can be used for updating the parameter vector of the struc-ture of Fig. 10 . The approximation leads to a simplified algorithm.

Figure 11 shows the final show-through (and blurring) removal algorithm which we used for obtaining the results presented in Sect. 5 . Note that since we do normalization at the beginning of this algorithm, there is no need to nor-malize the inputs of the algorithm described in Fig. 9 again. Applying this algorithm to Fig. 5 a and b leads to results shown in Fig. 12 a and b and demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in removing the blurring effect as well as the show-through. 5 Experimental results In this section, we will demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm for jointly removing the show-through and the blurring effects by performing experiments on real and artificial images. In the field of image processing, it is well known that usually subjective measures are better than quantitative measures (like SNR) for comparing the quality of two images. In addition, it is very hard to find a unique quantitative criterion for evaluating the performance of show-through removal algorithms and this is because of the fact that in almost all of the experiments performed on real degraded manuscripts or documents, original pure sources are not available. Therefore, quantitative criteria such as SNR are not always applicable. As a consequence, for comparing our method to previously developed algorithms qualitatively, we use the same images utilized in those works. In all of the following experiments, the initial value for parameters vec-tor p and the coefficients of the adaptive filters are zero. In addition,  X  adaptive and  X  ML are set to 0.00001 and 0.005, respectively. Registration of the input images is done sim-ply by shifting and rotating one of the input images with respect to the other one and minimizing the mean square error between them. Note also that in nonlinear BSS based on ICA, each source is retrieved at best up to an unknown nonlinear function [ 14 , 28 ]. Since for the recurrent structure utilized in this work the separability analysis has not yet be performed, indeterminacies involved in this problem are unknown. Nevertheless, we know that the two stable points of this recurrent structure differ from each other in scaling, permutation and additive constant [ 26 ]. Therefore, at the end of each simulation, we should adjust the DC and scaling of the output images. Since the retrieved images are similar to the scanned images except in those areas having show-through, the DC and scale of the images should not change significantly during the show-through removal process. As a result, in all of the following experiments, we change the DC and the scale of the output images so they will be equal to the DC and the scale of the input scanned images. As it is seen in ( 11 ) and ( 12 ), maximizing the likelihood needs estimation of the score functions. For this purpose, we used polynomial estimation of score functions [ 29 ] instead of the kernel estimation method used in [ 22 ], to obtain a fast and still accurate algorithm.

We can use two criteria for stopping the iterations: we can stop the algorithm (i) when the changes in the coeffi-cients of the adaptive filters are less than a specific amount or (ii) when the changes in the parameter vector, p ,issmall enough. Experimentally, the second option works better than the first one (because the second one is related to the show-through removal algorithm). However, since the two optimi-zation algorithms (the one for obtaining the coefficients of the filters and the one for determining the parameter value) are working independently, it is relevant to check both criteria as we have done in our simulations.

In the following experiments, we ran the algorithm described in Fig. 11 in MATLAB 7.1 on a Windows XP PC with a 1.7 GHz CPU and 256 MB of RAM.

The results of the first simulation that we performed by using the structure shown in Fig. 10 are shown in Fig. 13 c and d. The original images (Fig. 13 a and b) with show-through are obtained from the paper [ 27 ]. These images have been produced artificially by adding a blurred version of the original images and then noise. Therefore, it is obvi-ous that here the images have been mixed linearly, and not bilinearly.

The size of the input images is 99  X  98 pixels. The size of the adaptive filters was 9  X  9 and after the con-vergence of the structure, the final parameter vector was p =[ X  0 . 454 ,  X  0 . 42 , 0 . 007 , 0 . 012 ] T which confirms the approximate symmetry property assumed in Sect. 2 .The very small values of q 1 and q 2 confirms that this mixture is almost perfectly linear. For these particular input images, the algorithm converged after 26 iterations and each iteration took about 14 s. Output results are as perfect as the ones presented in [ 27 ] in removing show-through. Outputs of the structure of Fig. 4 for these input images are shown in Fig. 13 e and f. In these images, show-through has been removed almost completely but the blurring effect does still exist. Note that in this and all of the following experiments, absolute val-ues of l 1 and l 2 are less than unity. By considering ( 6 ), this is because of the fact that the strength of the show-through is less than the strength of the image which is printed on the backside of the paper. Moreover, these parameters have neg-ative signs which shows that the back-side image is added to and not subtracted from the front-side image. The most time consuming part of the algorithm is the calculation of the score functions of the sources which are needed in ( 12 ). In addition, as the size of the input images or adaptive fil-ters increases, computational time of the proposed algorithm increases as well.

In the next experiment, we considered the images pre-viously used in [ 7 ]. These are real data obtained through the scanning process, with an image size equal to 401 401 pixels. In this case, the structure of Fig. 10 converged after 29 iterations and the final parameter vector equals to p =[ X  0 . 311 ,  X  0 . 287 , 0 . 024 , 0 . 031 ] T . In this experiment, the size of the adaptive filters in that structure was 11 Each iteration took about 57 s. Figure 14 c and d show the final results. It is obvious especially in the right black part of the recovered image that the estimated front image has not become whiter in regions where the two (front and back) images have overlap, like what had been seen in Fig. 7 c and d. Finally, Fig. 14 e and f show the results obtained using the structure of Fig. 4 , which demonstrate the relevance of adap-tive filters in improving the quality of the output images.
Figure 15 illustrates the convergence of the coefficients of one of the adaptive filters through the run of the algorithm.
In the above experiments, the two input images were almost text and have little overlap with each others. Consequently, we performed another experiment on two real pictures strongly distorted by show-through as shown in Fig. 16 a and b. These scanned images are obtained by scan-ning both sides of a paper on which the images shown in Fig. 16 c and d had been printed. The image size is 326  X  and the algorithm converged after 71 iterations, and each iteration took about 35 s. The size of the adaptive filters was 5  X  5. After the convergence of the structure, the estimated parameter vector was p =[ X  0 . 476 ,  X  0 . 46 , 0 . 041 , The outputs of the algorithm are shown in Fig. 16 e and f. It is seen that the proposed structure removed the show-through considerably.

Another experiment is presented in Fig. 17 . The recto and verso images with the size of 570  X  698 are obtained from http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~edubois/documents . However, to improve visual quality, only parts of them are shown in Fig. 17 a and b. These are real ancient manuscripts whose readability is degraded due to the presence of show-through. The result of applying our show-through removal method to these figures is shown in Fig. 17 c and d. The amount of enhancement achieved in the read-ability of the manuscripts is evident in these figures. In this simulation, adaptive filters of size 3  X  3 have been used. Execution time of this experiment was about 2,163 s and the values of parameters vector converged to p [ X  0 . 301 ,  X  0 . 318 , 0 . 027 , 0 . 032 ] T .

In all of these simulations, the approximate size of the fil-ters is determined heuristically based on the severity of the blurring effect that we visually observed in scanned images: as the blurring effect becomes worse, the filter size should be increased. Then, the exact size of the filters are determined by trial and error. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we experimentally showed that show-through is a nonlinear phenomenon and can be approximately repre-sented by a linear-quadratic model. For such a mixing model, based on [ 22 , 23 ], we first used a linear-quadratic separating structure which is able to extract the original sources. Sim-ulations show that this structure can remove show-through but cannot cancel the blurring effect implied by the scanning process due to the paper X  X  intrinsic transparency. Therefore, we proposed a newer adaptive linear-quadratic blind source separating structure, in which one adds adaptive filters to estimate the shape of the point spread function of the paper. Therefore, using this separating structure, one can simulta-neously remove show-through and blurring effects. Finally, we justified the effectiveness of this new method with a few experiments on simulated mixtures and real-world scanned images. The results were very satisfactory in comparison with other current show-through removal methods.

The main advantages of this show-through removal method can be summarized as:  X  It may be extended to more complicated polynomial  X  Filter coefficients are updated adaptively. Therefore, the  X  This structure is also applicable to linear mixtures: in
For the near future, we are planning to complete our study about the theoretical invertibility of bilinear mixing models. In addition, investigating of the effects of those simplify-ing assumptions that we used in our method can be useful for improving the performance of the proposed algorithm. Another problem to be addressed is to find a procedure to evaluate the quality of the output results. By these objective performance indexes, we can provide more consistent com-parisons between show-through removal algorithms.
