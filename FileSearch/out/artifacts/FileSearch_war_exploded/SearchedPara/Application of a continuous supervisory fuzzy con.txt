 1. Introduction
In most of the industrial processes of practical significance, the production-flow control involves decision making in shop-floor operations such as part release, product routing, production orders scheduling, set-up times planning, etc. with the objective of produ-cing the customer demands in needed times and with minimum to find optimal production-flow control policies mainly due to the combinatorial and the multi-criteria nature of the decision problem.
Particularly, in scheduling problems the objective is to find a way to assign and sequence the use of shared resources such that production constraints are satisfied. These prob lems are traditionally addressed by: management science, operation research and industrial engineer-ing. However, the complexity and the importance of scheduling problems have concentrated the eff orts of different research commu-programming, system simulation ( Gertosio et al., 2000 ; Habchi and
Berchet, 2003 ) and control theory ( Cho and Prabhu, 2000 ; Gershwin, 2000 ; Wiendahl and Breithaupt, 2000 ).

More precisely, the scheduling of job-shop manufacturing systems with flexible machines and producing multiple part types have been studied by many approaches. The most developed ones have been enumerative algorithms that provide exact solutions either by means of elaborated and sophisticated mathematical constructs, such as linear and constraint programming ( Pinedo, 2002 ; Sanghoon and Mooyoung, 2003 ), or by means of the branch and bound enumerative strategy, which involves the search of a dynamically constructed tree that represents the solution space ( Brucher et al., 1994 ). However, the limitations of the enumera-tive techniques have led to suboptimal approximation methods using simulation with priority dispatching rules ( Chan et al., 2003 ; Jeong and Kim, 1998 ). Furthermore, in the case of incom-plete or imprecise data knowledge such as task durations due dates and production targets, some solutions for scheduling problems have been provided according to artificial intelligence techniques, including neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms and agent-based systems ( Akyol and Bayhan, 2007 ; Al-Hakim, 2001 ; Dang and Frankovic, 2002 ; Dubois et al., 2003 ;
Homayouni et al., 2009 ; Precup and Preitl, 2004 ; Suhail et al., 2009 ; Tsourveloudis et al., 2007 ).

From the above analysis, the research reported in this paper deals with the practical application of the discrete scheduling problems addressed by the continuous supervisory control previously developed in Tamani et al. (2009 ) on the basis of the fuzzy control and fuzzy interval arithmetic. Indeed, in our previous work, a supervisory control strategy based on the fuzzy arithmetic interval has been developed in order to provide the appropriate adjustment of the lower level fuzzy distributed controllers under multiple objectives. The supervisory controller combines multiple and possibly conflicting objectives such that a best compromise can be achieved. In this case, the overall objectives are quantified by fuzzy intervals since they are speci-fied as imprecise and uncertain information. The provided super-visory control actions aim to compensate the myopic of the distributed local control when the overall system performances deviate from their objectives.

In order to decrease the risk of implementation of the proposed control methodology in practical context and minimize the danger of the consequences (outcomes or results) of an insufficient synthesis, it is necessary to analyze the problem of stability. In the literature, several approaches have been proposed (qualitative and geometrical techniques, Lyapunov and LMI approaches, etc. ( Bellomoa et al., 2008 ; Lam and Leung, 2008 ; Mollov et al., 2002 ; Sala and Arino, 2007 )) to deal with this problem. In this paper, the stability is ensured in the sense that all the inputs, states and outputs quantities remain limited and bounded. This property of stability is guaranteed from the assumption that the system has a sufficient average capacity relative to an average demand. In this case, a feasibility condition of the demand is needed. From the robustness point of view, the proposed technique is analyzed in the presence of random disturbances such as machine failures.

Given the production rates computed by the intelligent supervisory control methodology, the objective is to perform a scheduling problem by managing the transient from the flow purpose, the developed scheduler is based on sampling procedure that translates the continuous-tim e production rates, computed at the flow control level, to a series of loading times at the shop-floor level. Moreover, in the contex t of multiple product systems, the selection of the actual part type to be processed at each machine of the scheduling decisions ( Shnits et al., 2004 ). In this case, the actual loading part is processed according to the route priority. This priority is measured using some c riterion based on the computed production rate values, the surplus performances (tracking error between the actual production and the demand) and the order of operations for re-entrant flow (the case where the parts visit the same machines several times).

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the continuous-flow approximation to model the discrete flow of parts in manufacturing systems. In Section 2, a short description of the proposed intelligent continuous flow control methodology, originally developed in Tamani et al. (2009 ), is presented. Section 4 introduces the sampling and dispatching procedure for discrete real-time scheduling of part types at shop-floor level. Section 5 illustrates the scenario and the experimental results for re-entrant and multi-product actual manufacturing systems. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 6. 2. Continuous-flow dynamic model
Many industrial production sy stems, such as semiconductor and stochastic systems. They involve different kinds of operation (transformation, assembly or disa ssembly), operate in an uncertain and unpredictable environment and manufacture a high-volume and medium-variety of products. For such a process, the discrete materials flow can be approximated with a continuous model ( Brandimarte et al., 1996 ; Kouikoglou and Phillis, 1997 ), which may reduce the (real) values ( Gershwin, 2000 ).

At the shop-floor level, the manufacturing system can be viewed as a network of a finite number of machines and buffers. Thus, when considering a system composed of N machines M i ( i  X  1, y according to the operation type ( transformation, assembly and disassembly), it may be decomposed into N generic production modules PM ( i ). Each one is composed of a machine M i and its sets of upstream and downstream buffers denoted B  X  ( i )and B ( i ), card{ B  X  ( i )}  X  card{ B ( i )}  X  1with B  X  ( i )  X  { B the production module can be defined as PM ( i )  X  { B i 1
For the sake of simplicity, the developments are given for a single-
B is given by the variable x i , collecting continuously the products coming from machine M i and feeding machine M i  X  1 .Themachines and downtimes are assumed to be exponentially distributed with rates l i and m i , respectively. The production rate of machine M , is supposedly known and deterministic. When machine is up, i.e., b to any value between zero and its maximum rate u i max  X  1/ 0 r u i ( t ) r u i max . When the machine is down, i.e., b tion rate is zero. Thus, the increasing rate of buffer B i the production rate u i of the feeding machine M i .Thedecreaseof buffer level x i is in relation with the processing rate u downstream machine M i  X  1 . Therefore, by aggregating the increasing and decreasing rates, the dynamic model of the evolution of buffer level (production-flow) x i is given by _ x  X  t  X  X  u i  X  t  X  u i  X  1  X  t  X  , with 0 r x i  X  t  X  r x max
This dynamic equation represents the basis of the continuous-flow model used in simulation. The restriction in (1) concerns the inability of buffer x i to increase its content while the capacity bound x i max is reached. When considering a manufacturing com-posed of N production modules, its dynamic is governed by N differential equations according to (1).

To ensure a stable system, and thus, the existence of feasible control policies, the average system capacity is assumed to be larger than the demand rate d , i.e., Perkins and Kumar (1989) :  X  u i m i =  X  l i  X  m i  X  4 d  X  2  X 
In this case, let us define the fraction of the capacity of M devoted for processing at time t as follows: r  X  t  X  X  that adjusts the production rate between zero and its maximum.
Further, in order to track the demand (requirement) at each thedifferencebetweenthecumul ative production (performance measure) at this means (denoted y i )andthedemand,istakeninto account in the design of the closed loop control system. 3. Intelligent continuous-flow control methodology
Given a manufacturing system represented by the production-flow dynamic model (1), the control objective is to adjust the production rates, through an appropriate capacity allocation policy, in such a way to reach a predefined required production (demand) while keeping all overall performance measures within their acceptable values ( Ioannidis et al., 2004 ; Tamani et al., 2009 ). For this purposes, in our previous work, the continuous-flow control methodology of two levels has been developed with a set of distributed fuzzy controllers at the lower level and a supervisory controller at the higher level. This section recalls the flow control methodology principles with focuses on the super-visory control strategy. 3.1. Distributed fuzzy control for machine X  X  capacity allocation
Given a generic production module PM ( i ), the control law is determined on the basis of the expert knowledge, where a fuzzy system, constituting a controller FC ( i ), has been used. The control objective is to track the demand while keeping the upstream and downstream buffers of M i neither full nor empty. This is achieved by allocating an optimized machine capacity to production at each instant according the following rules:
If the surplus level is satisfying (normal), then try to prevent starving or blocking by increasing or decreasing the produc-tion rate of the machine.

If the surplus level indicates backlog or excess inventory, then produce with the maximum rate or stop the production, respectively.

Thus, the input variables of the levels of upstream and down-stream buffers x i 1 ( t ), x i ( t ) and the production surplus s
PM ( i ) have been considered. The output variable of the controller
PM ( i ) between zero and its maximum u i max . Fig. 2 illustrates the fuzzy control structure FC ( i ) for a transformation operation. The fuzzy controller FC ( i ) has been formalized using a Takagi X  Sugeno system ( Galichetetal.,2004 ; Sugeno, 1999 ; Takagi and Sugeno, 1985 ), given by a collection of rules in the following form:
R i : IF x i 1 is X where
X input variables x i 1 , x i and s i , taken respectively from the sets
X i-1  X  X i  X  {Empty, Almost Empty, Normal, Almost Full, Full} and S i  X  {Backlog, Normal, Inventory}. f i is the real value involved in the rule conclusion to processing.

When assuming a strict partitioning of the different universes of discourse of the input variables, the output generated by the fuzzy controller is given by r  X  t  X  X  truth value of the premises of the rules (4), and I  X  I 1 indicates the set of labels representing the rules base, with i n A
I  X  {1, y ,5} for n  X  1, 2 and i 3 A I 3  X  {1, 2, 3}.

Fig. 3 shows the response surfaces of the fuzzy controller where the surplus is investigated. The universe of discourse of the buffer levels x i-1 and x i are normalized with regard to the buffer sizes x and x max , respectively, in order to take values within [0.1] ( Fig. 3 ), while the universe of discourse of the surplus s i is normalized with regard to the hedging level z i representing the target state of the buffers is able to absorb the disturbances.

Thecompleterulebaseforafuzzycontrollerofatransformation module is given in Tamani et al. (2009 ). In the case of assembly and disassembly modules, the local fuzzy controller is designed similarly by taking into account more than o ne upstream buffer level and more than one downstream buffer level, respectively, as input variables in a way to synchronize the operations with the objective of balancing the system load.

Finally, when considering a general manufacturing system composed of N modules, the fuzzy control design detailed above 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 is Normal has been deployed for each ones, which leads to a distributed fuzzy control (DFC) structure. The major advantage of this control architecture resides in its modularity and distributivity that enhance the flexibility of the system and make easily the implementation phases in complex manufacturing systems. 3.2. Supervisory based fuzzy arithmetic interval
In fully distributed control systems, global optimization is hard to obtain due to the difficulty of proving that a sufficient level of performance can be attained. This difficulty is mainly due to the order to maintain a certain performance level, it is frequently necessary to deal with myopic beha vior by defining a kind of  X  X  X lobal optimizing mechanism X  X  (GOM) ( Trentesaux, 2009 ).

There are several ways to integrate GOM into distributed control systems. Common solutions are to e nsure that local decisions are tions within which global performa nce level must be maintained. In our case, the last idea has been considered in order to integrate GOM through a supervisory controller. Indeed, given a set of performance indicators P  X  { P 1 , y , P L } with associated objectives P through an additive component in order to compensate the devia-tions of performance measures from their objectives. Since these the supervision function resides in
The fuzzy intervals representation of the objectives to handle uncertainty.

The aggregation process based on the fuzzy interval arithmetic to deal with conflicts.

For the first point, a trapezoidal fuzzy interval, denoted by P , has been used to represent the objective associated to the performance indicator P l as illustrated in Fig. 4 . The shape of the fuzzy interval is specified by two functions that link the support and the kernel values according to the vertical dimension. These functions, denoted by ( P l obj ) (the increasing part in Fig. 1 ) and ( P case of trapezoidal shape, they are defined by 8 &lt; :  X  6  X 
According to the trapezoidal representation of the objective, the satisfaction may be total when the performance indicator evolves within the kernel (normal mode), not satisfactory at all if it is outside the support (fully degraded mode), and not satisfac-tory with different degrees when it is limited by the left or right profiles (switching mode) ( Fig. 4 ). These different situations distinguish the operating modes of the production system.
For the second point, given the fuzzy intervals of the objec-tives, the principle of the supervision mechanism is summarized on the following three steps: Step 1 : Combine the objectives P obj  X  { P 1 obj , y , P uncertain operator C , since they are defined by fuzzy intervals ( Boukezzoula et al., 2007 ). The combined objective is a fuzzy interval denoted by P obj T .
 Step 2: Combine the performance indicator measures
P  X  { P 1 , y , P L } using the precise version of the operator C , denoted as c . The combined measure is denoted as P T .
Step 3: Evaluate the resulted precise measure P T with regard to the fuzzy objective P obj T . The result represents the satisfaction degree of the combined objective (the a -cut), which indicates the current operating mode.

At the first step, the arithmetic operations on fuzzy intervals are 2007 , 2006 ; Klir 1997 ). In this case, the uncertain operator can be implemented as the weighted mean operator, OWA operator ( Yager and Kacprzyk, 1997 ), Choquet integral operator ( Grabisch and
Roubens, 2000 ), etc. For instance, when using the weighted mean operator, the resulted fuzzy interval is expressed as follows:
P
T  X  C  X  P where P is the fuzzy addition betwee n fuzzy intervals such that ( P
The second step is performed in the same way by considering the precise performance indicator measures according to the step, the resulted satisfaction degree (the a -cut) is used to determine the additive component (supervisory control action), denoted r s i , under the constraint of the local control r illustrates the synopsis of the supervision principle.
The different values of r s i are encapsulated within a triangular fuzzy interval R s i with the support R s i  X  0  X  X  X  r c i -cut (1  X  r c is still trapezoidal, it can be observed that the switching between the operating modes is gradual, which reduces the chattering phenomenon that may occur around the limits of conventional interval, and thus involves more stable performances. The limit values of the supervisory control action consist to allocate the maximum remaining capacity  X  1 r c i  X  or to stop the production  X  r
 X  of the module PM ( i ). The intermediate values allow weight-ing the support bounds of R s i according to the satisfaction degree (the a -cut) of the combined overall objective ( Fig. 6 ).
For practical implementation, the supervisory control is deter-mined according to the following statements: normal mode. This means that the satisfaction degree of the objective is total ( a  X  1). In this case, the supervisor does not provide additive component ( r s i  X  t  X  X  0).

If P T evolves outside the support of P T obj , a fully degraded operating mode is detected. The objective in this case is totally unsatisfied ( a  X  0), and the supervisory action is given by r  X  t  X  X  D r c i  X  t  X  with D  X 
It consists in either allocating the maximum remaining capa-city ( D  X  1) or stopping the productivity of the module ( D  X  0).
If P T evolves in the switching modes, the corresponding a -cut of the fuzzy interval P T obj is used to determine the supervisory control. Whether P T evolves on the left or right profile, the a -cut level is given by the reverse of the corresponding profile function. That is, on one hand, when P T evolves on the left profile, the supervisory control is given as r  X  t  X  X  X  1 a  X  X  1 r c i  X  t  X  X  with a  X  X  X  P obj T  X   X  P T  X  X 
In this case, the action attempts to allocate a fraction of the remaining capacity. On the other hand, when P l evolves on the right profile, the supervisory action attempts to reduce the productivity of the controlled module as follows: r  X  t  X  X  X  1 a  X  X  r c i  X  t  X  X  with a  X  X  X  P obj T  X   X   X  P T  X  X 
The functions (9) and (10) represent, respectively, the right and left profiles of a triangular fuzzy interval R s i of the supervisory control domain ( Fig. 5 ). They timely provide the weighting factors for the supervisory action into the switching modes according to the satisfaction degree of the overall combined objective.

Finally, according to the local control given by the local fuzzy controller and the supervisory control, the production rate is adjusted as follows: u  X  t  X  X  X  r c i  X  t  X  X  r s i  X  t  X  X  u max i  X  r i  X  t  X  u max
The proposed intelligent supervisory control structure is illustrated in Fig. 7 for the case of transfer line composed by
N transformation modules. 3.3. Stability of the control methodology
Intuitively, the stability analysis of the proposed control technique is based on the balance between the input and the output production flows. The difference between two flows represents the number of parts in intermediate buffers and those in the transformation process on the machines. A non-bounded accumulation of flow can be interpreted as an instability of the system. Moreover, a prolonged rupture of buffers causes an important delay on the production. This phenomenon can be also viewed as an instability problem.

For a given feasible demand d , the production surplus s i defines the tracking error, i.e., the difference between the cumu-lative production and the demand, must be bounded for all production modules. In other words, an important tracking error can generate a signal that may deteriorate performances or even cause instability. In this context, it has been proved ( Perkins and
Kumar, 1989 ; Sharifnia, 1994 ) that the stability of the supervisory control methodology is mainly related to the satisfaction of the feasibility condition (2), which represents a necessary condition.
Indeed, it is assumed that the system has a sufficient average capacity to ensure a stable system, i.e., the average capacity is no less than the average demand. Thus, the control structure composed of N machines M i is said to be stable if there exists finite constants L i such that sup where T is the production makespan, i.e., the time period elapsing until the production goal is achieved for all products types.
As it has been pointed out in fuzzy control literature, fuzzy controllers have good performances only over finite input space regions (universes of discourse). This remark implies that the stability of the developed control method is only guaranteed when the controller inputs remain within the operating universes

PM ( i ) of discourse ( Sugeno, 1999 ). Although this limitation induces some theoretical drawbacks, it does not result in practical difficulties. Indeed, in most industrial applications the operating system region is restricted to a finite one by physical constraints. In this case, the stability can be ensured if the controller variables are defined on the possible physical range of the system inputs. In our case, this condition is ensured by Eqs. (1) and (12). 4. Discrete real-time scheduling methodology
Conventional formulation of the scheduling problem consists in the optimization of some criterion, such as the makespan and total production cost, under time and resource constraints. In the previous section, the production rates (11) are approximated by a continuous expression while the production operations are of discrete nature. Therefore, considering the criterion of makespan and production cost minimization, the scheduling problem involves two types of decisions at this level: to determine the loading times of actual parts, and to resolve the conflicts in the case of multiple-part-type systems.

For the first decision, a dispatching policy has to be used in order to determine the loading times of actual parts. More precisely, the obtained continuous-time control variables have to be translated into a dispatching time series through a sampling procedure. Indeed, since the machine operation frequency is equivalent to the time between two successive machine loads, at a certain time, the sampled value is held constant during a time interval equal to its reverse. The holding period includes the operation and the idle times. Thus, the continuous time produc-tion rate is translated to a piece-wise constant function as shown in Fig. 8 .

Using this definition, as the production rate evolves between 0 and u i max , the lower bound corresponds to an infinite idling time (no production) while the upper bound corresponds to the operation time (no idle time). For practical use, in order to limit the idle period when the production rate is too low, the lower bound is chosen equal to 50% of its maximum. 4.1. Multipe-part-type formulation
For the case of a multiple-part-type system, a machine M i re-entrant flow if K j 4 1). In this case, the original machine M virtually divided into N ( i )  X  P { j 9 j A Q ( i )} K j m ijk . Set-up times are assumed to be insignificant. When considering a constant demand rate d j of the production of the part type j ,the feasibility condition (2) becomes
X where t j ( k ) is the processing time of the sub-machine m the k th operation of part type j on M i . To distribute the machine operating time to the different p art types, and consequently the decision of the production rate u ijk of every sub-machine m assumption that all part types are o f equal importance is considered.
In this case, the maximum production rate of the sub-machine m equal to u
Thus, the production rate u ijk of each operation k of every product j would be u
M is calculated as follows:
RT  X  t  X  X  1
The value of (16) is distributed to the operations with the highest priority. It is given to the operations having the global control law r ijk equal to 1. The extra machine time devoted to the operations with the highest priority is
E  X  t  X  X  RT i  X  t  X  C ijk  X  t  X  X  17  X  where
C  X  t  X  X 
Finally, the production rate of the sub-machine m ijk is u  X  t  X  X  r ijk  X  t  X  u max ijk  X  E ijk  X  t  X 
Considering the assumption that only one sub-machine is allowed to work at a time, the fractions of production capacity
A ijk and remaining time C ijk are equal to one. Consequently, the entire production capacity (15) and the remaining operating time (17) are devoted to the selected sub-machine. 4.2. The selection criterion
In order to deal with conflicts in the scheduling problem, the actual parts to be processed at each machine are determined according to a decision function based on some criterion repre-senting the route priority measurement. The derivation of the criterion value is based on the control input values: the surplus performances (local and final) and the order of the operation in the case of re-entrant flow. The part to be loaded is the one with the largest criterion value. The proposed criterion value for each sub-machine m ijk of a certain multiple-part-type machine M u ( t s u u ( t s given by the following weighting sum:
J  X  where ijk is the sampled value of the computed production rate ^ u the sub-machine m ijk , ijk is its corresponding local surplus such that c the last sub-machine of its route. That is, it is track at each instant whether there is backlog or surplus in the finished production of the part-type j . ijk is the order k in which the part of type j visits the machine M
In the criterion definition above, g (.) is a positive monotoni-cally increasing non-linear function, with g (0)  X  0 and g  X  c l for c l dals of the form: g  X  c l ijk  X  X  1 =  X  1  X  exp  X  2 c l ijk gives the maximum value for the route (sub-machine), which presents the highest calculated production rate, the largest back-log (negative local and final surpluses) and the latest operation in the state of the actual route. The parameters p l are the weighting factors to be chosen according to the importance of each element . The following algorithm summarizes a practical implementa-tion of the discrete dispatching procedure:

In this section, the developed scheduling methodology is illustrated through a simulation study performed on realistic manufacturing cells taken from Rovithakis et al. (1999 , 2001 ).
Comparisons with the results reported herein of the existing scheduling policies and those obtained with the first in first out largest buffer (CLB) ( Perkins and Kumar, 1989 )andthedynamic neural network scheduler (DNN) developed in Rovithakis et al. (1999 ) have been employed. In order to analyze the robustness of the scheduling methodology, the simulation runs are performed in both deterministic and unreliable machines with heterogeneous part processing times. 5.1. Practical implementation considerations
In this section, the practical implementation of the scheduling methodology is discussed. For the studied applications, the control parameters are chosen as follows:
The fuzzy distributed control parameters consist to define the universes of discourse for the inputs of each sub-machine fuzzy controller (operation). The stock capacities for all buffers in the system and the desired target states (hedging levels of the buffers) define the parameters of the fuzzy controllers. In the studied case, all intermediate buffers X  target states have been set equal to one. Thus, the universe of discourse of the buffer x i is [0, x i max ] while the surplus s i is [0, 2 z representing the target state.

The supervisory control parameters consist to choose the overall performance indicators and to quantify their associated objectives by managing the uncertainties. In both cases, the overall objectives are specified in terms of backlog; work-in-process and production cost minimization.

Then, the overall performance indicators of the average and the instantaneous finished surplus, and the total production cost are adopted. This total cost is given by Total Cost  X  c wip WIP  X  c inv INV  X  c bck BCK  X  c lt LT  X  21  X 
The first two terms of (21) represent the cost measures of storing parts in buffers. Specifically, measures for the work-in-process and inventory costs are provided by means of the average integral of the intermediate and output buffers, respectively. P
Real-time scheduling (discrete dispatching) Flow control level Shop-floor level 
Discretisation (applied intermediate and output buffers in the cell, and T is the produc-tion makespan.

The two last terms of (21) are concerned with the average backlog costs (i.e., the cost resulting from the delay in achieving production targets) and the average lead time costs (i.e., the average of the time elapsing between the input of a raw material in the cell and the output of the respective finished product). Specifically, the employed average backlog is defined as follows: BCK  X  1 =  X  TN out  X  entered the cell and released it until time t .

The cost units c wip , c inv , c bck and c lt for all the performance measures in (21) are taken equal to 1 for simplicity. The associated objectives, expressed by fuzzy intervals through the profile functions (6), for the surplus performances (the instantaneous and the average importance, the arithmetic mean operator (7) is used to combine the resulted interval is P
T  X  C  X  P Obtaining: P obj T  X  X  1 : 996  X  1 : 363 a , 2 : 366 1 : 366 a .
The discrete scheduling algorithm parameters consist to choose the weight factors p l of the route priority selection criterion (20). Since, the production rate value is considered as the more important criterion and the surpluses (local and finished) are of equal importance, the factors p l are taken respectively equal to 0.4, 0.25, 0.25 and 0.1.

For the simulation process, the proposed scheduling metho-dology is implemented by means of Matlab/Simulink and
Floulib toolbox ( Foulloy et al., 2006 ) (available at http:// www.listic.univ-savoie.fr ), while the FIFO policy is tested through discrete event simulator with the help of the Apollo platform ( Habchi and Berchet, 2003 ). 5.2. Manufacturing cell description
The considered system consists of five machines and produces five different part types. Due to one assembly process, six routes are The routes 1 and 6 lead to the part types to be assembled on machine 5. The table elements show the order in which every product visits the machines. A production demand of 20 parts for each of the 5 part types has to be achieved. For simplicity, the operation times for all products on the same machine are assumed to be equal. The machine operation times are taken equal to 5, 6, 5, 4 and 3 time units. In this case, all the machines are homogenous, that is the operation of all sub-machines of the same machine is of equation duration. The number, of intermediate and output buffers are N in  X  16 and N out  X  5, respectively.

The number of operations for the second machine is equal to 7 instead of 6, since it serves part type 1 twice (re-entrant flow). The same holds for machine M 3 , where part type 4 is also served twice. Furthermore, raw materials arrive in the cell at a rate of 0.03 part per time unit, implying that for each route a raw material arrives every 34 time units, and is stored in the buffer of raw materials. All buffers in the cell are considered to have a capacity of 15 parts. Raw materials arrive to the system at the specified rate, for so long as the production of the respective product is not complete, and the buffer storing raw materials has not reached its capacity.

Based on the workload of the cell bottleneck machine, i.e., machine M 2 , the authors in Rovithakis et al. (1999 ) define a lower bound for the achievement of the production demand (make-span), which serves as the reference for comparison purposes.
Specifically, the machine M 2 (7 sub-machines for 7 different operations) must process 140 parts requiring 7 20 6  X  840 time units. As the first raw material arrives in the cell at time 34, a lower bound of 874 time units has been derived. Thus, the demand rate of the bottleneck machine is given as d  X  (sum of demands of each sub-machine)/(lower bound of makespan), i.e., d  X  (20 7)/874  X  0.1602 part per time unit.

In order to guarantee stable poli cy, it is necessary to verify the feasibility condition that can be expressed by min i  X  1, for reliable machines, min i  X  1 y 5 [1/5,1/6,1/5,1/4,1/3]  X  0.1667 4 0.1602, resulting that the system has sufficient capacity to ensure a stable control policy within the makespan as defined above. Fig. 10 illustrates the Matlab/Simulink implementation model used in the simulation of the manufacturing cell. 5.3. The simulation results
In order to evaluate the effect of the supervision, the proposed methodology is simulated in both cases: without supervision (distributed fuzzy control  X  DFC) and with supervisory control (supervisory fuzzy control  X  SFC). The obtained results are com-pared to the conventional FIFO strategy and those provided in
Rovithakis et al. (1999 ), and are summarized in Table 2 for the case of reliable machines. In this case, the machine utilization rates are given in Table 3 , while Fig. 11 presents the comparison of the evolution of the finished cumulative production for each part type obtained by the schedulers FSC, DFC and FIFO.
Table 4 shows, in terms of average of ten simulation runs, the generate as much the downtimes as the repair times, the exponential model was used. The repair rates are all equal to m i  X  0.5 repair per feasibility condition in this case is expressed as min i  X  1 production (demand) cannot be achieved within the makespan as defined previously. Best results are obtained for a period of 965.7 time units, which represents 0.1450 parts per time unit (20 7/965.7). With unreliable machines, a reference makespan 5.4. Discussion
Based on the obtained results, both the SFC and the FIFO emerge as schedulers guaranteeing accurate achievement of production. Indeed, the SFC methodology achieves the demand with the exact calculated lower bound in the case of reliable machines (value in bold in Table 2 ), and with a deviation of 10.49% from the lower bound when unreliable machines are considered (see Table 4 ). The conventional FIFO scheduler rule achieves the production goal in 877 time units for reliable manufacturing cell, thus obtaining very short deviation from the lower bound (0.34%, Table 2 ). In presence of machine failures, the deviation observed by FIFO scheduler is equal to 14.88% ( Table 4 ). The utilization rate of the bottleneck machine ( M 2 ) in the case of
SFC and FIFO methodologies, which is approximately 96%, is improved in comparison to the rate reached with a DFC metho-dology ( Table 3 ). This behavior was expected since the super-visory goals are to maintain the overall production objectives within their specified domain limits by allocating the remaining production capacity when delays are detected.

The four last columns of Tables 2 and 4 represent average cost measures of storing parts, backlo gs and lead times for the reliable and unreliable manufacturing ce ll, respectively. The last column provides the total production cost in both cases. It can be observed that the SFC methodology achieves efficient WIP cost by keeping intermediate buffers state as small as desired, while guaranteeing system stability and robustness in presence of machine X  X  failure.
Inventory and lead time costs are also of acceptable levels compared to the conventional scheduling policies FIFO, CAF and CLB due to the overall faster fulfillment of the demand. Conversely, the backlog cost is relatively worse than the values obtained by the conventional (CLB, CAF) and DNN schedulers, while it is better when compared to
FIFO and DFC. These results are due to the fact that the buffers storage performances (positive surplus  X  WIP and inventory) and thebacklog(negativesurplus)areconflictingandtheproposed supervisory control attempts to achieve the best compromise that is obtained in term of total production cost ( Table 2 ,inbold). 5.5. Heterogeneous job-shop application
In order to enhance the robustness of our research, the proposed scheduling methodology was also applied for scheduling existing mechanical workshop derived from Rovithakis et al. (2001 ). The results led a thorough assessment of our algorithm in the case of deterministic large scale job shop system with extremely hetero-geneous part processing times. The scheduling problem has been posed as the problem of production of 18 different order types.
Tables 5 and 6 provide the different product type routes and processing steps duration in minutes, respectively (18 machines with N  X  77 and N out  X  18). The detailed description of the manufacturing cell is provided in Rovithakis et al. (2001 ).

The simulation is performed when demanding D j ( j  X  1, y 5, 2, 20, 20, 15, 10 and 20 parts. The arrival rate of 0.035 parts per minute implying one part arrives every 28.6 min is assumed. According to the notation given in Section 4.1 for the multiple-part-type system, the time required for the minimum work of specific test case, considering the minimum time required for a single part to reach machine input (28.6 min), the lower bound of the makespan has been found equal to 18723.7 min, which is the workload of the cell bottleneck machine 731. For this latter, the feasibility condition (13) is expressed as follows:
X 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 0 5 10 15 20 25 Time resulting that the system has enough capacity to ensure stable control policy within the makespan.

The main results, summarized in Table 7 , obtained under the same assumptions given in Section 5.1, show that the SFC methodology achieves the production goal (demand of 273 parts) with a deviation of 6.61% from the calculated lower bound of the makespan. This represents slight improvement when compared to the FIFO scheduler, while the WIP and the average lead time are considerably reduced.

Finally, the derived results are very promising, since the decision method is flexible when considered in conjunction with the real-time property and the multiple production objectives.
This may help to cope with the conflicting control objectives and make the scheduling process more efficient in the real-time control of manufacturing systems. 6. Conclusion
In this paper, the potential application of the production-flow control for discrete scheduling of a manufacturing cell is inves-tigated. The production-flow control methodology, initially devel-oped in Tamani et al. (2009 ), consists of distributed fuzzy controllers that are supervised by a higher level of decision-making. The objective is to allocate the limited production capacity by adjusting the machine processing rates such that the specified global performances are guaranteed. The super-visory mechanism based on arithmetic fuzzy interval provides additive components to the local controllers when degraded operating modes are detected. The supervisor is built according to the satisfaction degree of the different and possible conflicting objectives quantified by fuzzy intervals.

At the shop-floor level, the scheduling problem is addressed in two steps. The first step performs the transition from a computed continuous control to a discrete dispatching control through a sampling procedure. The principle consists to transform the calculated production rates to time intervals by taking their inverse. The second step deals with the conflicts of multiple routes using some criterion representing a measure of the priority. The proposed criterion is based on the production rates, the surplus performances and the order in which the products visit the machine. Comparisons through simulations show that the proposed methodology achieves the production in the short-est time with regard to conventional schedulers.

The only uncertainties considered in this paper are the overall objectives quantification and the machine failures. An important open issue is the robustness of the methodology when other forms of uncertainty are present, such as random arrival, service time, set-up times, etc. Another interesting extension would be the integration of the diagnosis function in the control level in order to schedule the maintenance activities in the shop-floor level.
