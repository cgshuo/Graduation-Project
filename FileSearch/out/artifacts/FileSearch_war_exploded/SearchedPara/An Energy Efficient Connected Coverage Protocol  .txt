 Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of a large number of sensors. They can sense and collect information from all kinds of objects in the monitored area. Furthermore, they can process the gathered information and send it back to users. Therefore, they are being widely employed for military fields, national security, environmental monitoring, and disaster prevention and recovery [1]. However, due to addition, it is usually hard to recharge the battery after deployment, either because the deployment area is hostile, or because the number of sensor nodes is too large. Once deployed, a WSN is expected to keep working for several weeks or months. Therefore, energy efficiency becomes the essential requirement in WSNs. Sensor scheduling plays a critical role for energy efficiency in WSNS. 
On the other hand, it is required that WSNs can provide the high quality of sensing area coverage and ensure the network connectivity. The connected coverage is one of the most important problems in WSNs. The existing algorithms in maintaining connected coverage usually rely on the availability of accurate location information such as that obtained with the GPS systems and the directional antenna technology. However, the energy cost and system complexity involved in obtaining the accurate location information may compromise the effectiveness of proposed solution as a since GPS and other complicated hardware devices consume too much energy and the without accurate location information, how to energy-efficiently schedule sensor nodes to meet both constraints of sensing area coverage and network connectivity. 
Our work is based on the (connected) dominating set (CDS), which has extensively been investigated sparse structure in ad hoc wireless networks. Much work has been done to derive distributed algorithms [3],[4],[5],[6],[7] to construct minimal (connected) dominating set (MDS) with different objective functions. It is obvious that MDS provide coverage of points in an area (termed point coverage) when the point coverage is equivalent to area sensing area coverage in the high density of deployed sensors [8]. However, point coverage is in general not equivalent to area coverage. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between them, and derive the upper and lower bound that the point coverage of MDS is equivalent to area coverage in random geometric graphs. Based on the theoretical results, we propose an energy efficient connected coverage protocol (EE CCP) that incorporates existing connected dominating set (CDS) selection algorithms to determine the set of active sensor nodes. In EECCP, every sensor nodes can adjust its own Rt based on local nodes density, and schedule its own status to construct CDS without accurate location information. The active nodes can maintain both high quality of Rs and network connectivity. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of related work in connected coverage. The next section introduces some necessary notations and preliminaries. Section 4 establishes the analytical results on relationship between the point coverage and sensing are coverage. A connected coverage protocol, EECCP is proposed and evaluated in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively. Finally, we conclude the paper. Recently, researches have considered conn ectivity and coverage in an integrated platform. In [9], the authors consider an unreliable sensor network and sensor nodes are deployed strictly in grids. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the area coverage and network connectivity with high probability are provided. In [10], it is proved that to ensure that the full sensing area coverage of a convex area also guarantee the connectivity of the active nodes, the communication range should be at least twice of the sensing range. Therefore, the connected coverage problem is simplified to maintain a complete coverage. Based on the analytical results, Zhang et al. proposed a distributed, localized de nsity control algorithm named OGDC [10]. Wang et al. draw the same conclusion in [11], and presented a unified framework to study both coverage and connectivity problems. They used the SPAN [12] protocol to maintain coverage, and a separate CCP prot ocol to maintain coverage. Carle et al. proposed SCR-CADS algorithm to maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity when Rs equals to Rt [13]. Gupta et al defined the connected sensor cover, and demonstrated that the calculation of the smallest connected sensor cover is NP-hard and they proposed both centralized and distributed approximate algorithms to solve it and provide the performance bounds as well [14]. Zou et al considered the variable radii k1-connected k2-cover problem by adjusting the sensing range and transmission range [15]. The authors proposed a distributed and local Voronoi X  X ased and relative neighborhood graph (RNG)-based algorithm to preserve k1 connectivity and k2 coverage. However, unlike our appro ach, the above algorithms all require each redundancy. In this paper, we address how to ensure both sensing area coverage and network connectivity without accurate location information. A dominating set (DS) of an undirected graph G(V, E) is a subset V X  of the vertex set V such that every vertex in V-V X  is adjacent to a vertex in V X . A minimal dominating  X  are as follows. According to the definition of MDS, the nodes in the MDS set can control the nodes in the non-MDS set. When Rt = Rs , the MDS can provide coverage of points in the region M (termed point coverage). In addition, MDS  X  CDS, CDS not only meet the requirement of point coverage, but can ensure the network connectivity. However, point coverage is in general not equivalent to area coverage. In this section, we analyze the relationship between the point coverage and sensing area coverage, and derive the upper and lower bound that point coverage is equivalent to area coverage in random geometric graphs. Theorem 1. Given sensing range Rs and transmission range Rt, let Area(V) be the geometric area covered by all nodes in the network and Area(MDS) be the geometric area covered by the MDS. We have disks [16]. Before delving to the proof, we first introduce some lemmas. Lemma 1. Assume A be the geometric area covered by n disks deployed in a plane R is In lemma 1,  X  i denotes the contribution of disk B i  X  X  boundary to the perimeter of A . In particular, if a disk is fully contained inside A , the disk does not share boundary with A , and  X  i =0.The proof of lemma 1 refers to [16]. Lemma 2. Let A ( r ) be the numeric area of the union of n disks with the same radius r on a plane. Its derivative with respect to r is given by Area(S i  X  S j )=0. Due to the limit of the length of paper, we omit the proof of Lemma 2, 3 and 4. Now we are in the position to prove Theorem 1. Proof. (Theorem 1) A) () 1 Thus, M DS V  X  , maximum possible geometric area covered by D u is Area( D u )=  X  ( Rs+Rt ) 2 . The numeric areas covered by u and D u is 2 we have (1) None of the coverage area of the nodes in MDS overlap. Summing up coverage area of all the nodes in MDS, we have 2 While prove 2 show that the derivative 2() '( ) , 0 Ar Ar r
From Lemma 2, we have 
The term of B i that is at the boundary of A ( r ). A ( r ) and the line segments that join the end points of the arc segments and its center z , where m i is the number of disks which intersect with disk B i . Therefore, 
Since S i,mi  X  S i  X  B i , combining Equation (1) and (2), we get By definition of MDS, nodes in MDS can dominate all of the nodes in the network. Obviously, if the nodes are densely deployed, MDS can coverage almost of the monitored region when Rt = Rs . That is to say, the denser the deployment of sensors is, Theorem 1, we can see as long as Rt is significantly small, MDS can provide comparable sensing coverage as that of all sensor nodes. However, as Rt goes smaller, the number of nodes in MDS becomes larger, which results in the more energy node to ensure MDS can provide the high quality of sensing coverage. 
The upper and lower bound that point coverage is equivalent to sensing coverage in random geometric graphs will be discussed as follows. Theorem 2. Suppose sensor nodes follow Poisson point process of density  X  in the Proof. Consider an arbitrary point p  X  R 2 . A sufficient condition that point p is within distance from point p . cases. Case one: If u  X  MDS, point p must lie within ( r + Rt ) distance from the node u , within Rt distance from dominator v , d ( u,v )  X  Rt . Combining two cases, we get dominator node v (as illustrated in Fig 1). The sufficient condition holds. when d ( u,p )&lt; r &lt; Rs . Therefore, the following equality holds, P (  X  v  X  MDS , s.t. d ( v,p )  X  r+Rt )  X  P (  X  u  X  V , s.t. d ( u,p )&lt; r )= 2 Let  X  r =min( Rs , From Theorem 2, we have the following result: Theorem 3. Given sensing range Rs, if all points in the monitored region are covered by sensor nodes, then there exists a point p not covered by MDS for Rt&gt;2Rs. Proof. We use a proof by contradiction. Suppose every point in the region is covered by MDS for Rt&gt;2Rs . Without loss of generality, consider an arbitrary dominator v  X  MDS. Let S v be the set of nodes in MDS that are on the boundary or inside of disk B (the region is B v ( Rt /2)-B v ( Rs ), as illustrated in shadow part of Fig 2) are not covered by either node v (since Rt /2 &gt;Rs ) or other nodes excluding node v in MDS (since these covered by the MDS, which contradicts every point is covered by the MDS. 
Since S v  X   X  , S v can dominate the node v . These are two cases about the relationship between S v and D v , Define D v ={ w | d ( w,v )  X  Rt , w  X  V }. the nodes in S v still dominate the nodes in D v . In another word, the resulting set MDS-{ v } is still a dominating set. This contradicts with the definition of MDS.  X  Based on the assumption that every point is covered by MDS, the point p must be point p is not covered by MDS. can be removed from MDS, the nodes in S v still dominate the nodes in D v . Equivalently, the resulting set MDS-{ v } is still a dominating set. This contradicts with the definition of MDS. By case 1 and case 2, Theorem 3 holds.  X  Theorem 2 and 3 give the up the upper and lower bound that transmission range of sensors respectively. By Theorem 2, adjusting the appropriate Rt , CDS can provide the same sensing coverage as that of all sensor nodes with probability at least 1- X  and ensure the connectivity. We propose an Energy Efficient Connected Coverage Protocol (EECCP) that provides good sensing coverage and ensures the network connectivity. EECCP protocol consists of two parts. First, nodes adjust the appropriate transmission range. Second, construct CDS using Rule K algorithm [7] to meet the requirement of connected coverage. It is proved that the resulting dominating set from the Rule K algorithm must be connected [7]. Therefore, EECCP protocol can provide the good sensing coverage and ensure the network connectivity. EECCP like other coverage algorithm also involves round-operation for energy-consumption balance. In every round, each sensor node adjusts the appropriate Rt and executes the Rule K algorithm to construct the CDS. The nodes in CDS become the working nodes to execute the monitoring task and transfer the sensory data. 5.1 Network Model Assume N sensor nodes are deployed randomly with a uniform distribution on a square field M. The sensor density is high enough that any point can be monitored by mode. The sensing range of a sensor is modeled by a disk of radius Rs , and the radio transceiver can adjust its transmission range by changing the transmission power. All sensors have the same sensing range. Sensors are location-unaware. 5.2 Adjust the Transmission Range By the Equation (3), we have Rt=Rs-min (Rs, value of  X  is changing. For a single node, it is very difficult to know the change of  X  . Therefore, each sensor determines a local node density  X  local by counting the number of nodes in its k -hop neighborhood using the maximum transmission range Rt max . reflect the variations of node density.  X  local can be computed as follows: where | c | is the number of k -hop neighbors. However, the increase of the number of messages will results in the more energy consumption. EECCP estimates the local density  X  local by counting the number of Combing the Equation (3) and (4), we have 
Therefore, each sensor can adjust the appropriate the transmission range by the number of nodes in its 1-hop neighbors and Equation (5). In this section, we evaluate EECCP X  X  performance by conducting simulations in terms of evaluating the number of working nodes, coverage ratio, the network lifetime and control overhead. In the simulation, 400-800 sensor nodes are randomly deployed in a 100 X 100 (m 2 ) region, and each sensor has a sensing range of 10 meter and the maximum transmission range of 20 meter. 6.1 Effectiveness of EECCP In the experiment, we vary  X  0 in the EECCP from 0.1 to 0.9 and investigate its impact on the sensing area coverage of the resulting working nodes (Fig. 3) and the number of working nodes (Fig. 4). Two scenarios are considered with sensor nodes 400 and 800 randomly distributed in the monitored area respectively. 
From Fig. 3 and 4, we observe that the value of  X  0 has no much impact on the sensing coverage and the number working nodes for EECCP. In general, when  X  =0.5, EECCP can provide the best sensing coverage and the least number of working nodes in the different node density. Therefore, we choose  X  0 =0.5 when investigating the network lifetime and control overhead for EECCP. Compared to EECCP, OGDC and GAF is not relevant to the parameter  X  0 =0.5. Thus, for OGDC and GAF, their curves of the number of working nodes and sensing coverage are parallel to X axis. 
On the other hand, in the most situations, EECCP can provide above 99.5% sensing coverage for the different node density. EECCP requires 2-hop neighboring information to provide the connected coverage without the location information of sensors; therefore the number of working nodes by EECCP is greater 13%~30% and 7%~26% than that of OGDC and GAF respectively. However, compared with the number of all deployed sensor nodes, the number of working nodes by EECCP is reasonable. In addition, the number of working nodes under EECCP does not greatly increases with the number of deployed nodes. 6.2 Network Lifetime If the current sensing coverage is lower than the threshold or the network is disconnected, WSNs could not perform the monitoring task. Thus, we consider the lifetime of sensor network is over in such a situation. In our simulation, we choose the threshold of sensing coverage is 70%. In another word, if the sensing coverage is lower than 70 % or the network is disconnected, we think the network lifetime is over. 
Fig. 5 shows the curves of lifetime for EECCP and OGDC with the different density of deployed sensors. From Fig. 5, for EECCP and OGDC, in the given network configuration, the network is disconnected before the sensing coverage drop to 70%. In addition, the coverage ratio drop more slowly in EECCP than that in OGDC, and the lifetime of EECCP is 35% longer than that of OGDC. This is due to the fact that every node must use the maximum transmission range to guarantee the network connectivity, while in EECCP, every node can adjust its own transmission range to make its decision, which consumes less energy than OGDC protocol. 6.3 Control Overhead For EECCP, first, each node needs to count the number of 1-hop neighbors and compute the appropriate transmission. Thus, each node consumes energy to receive and send control messages. Second, each n ode needs to know the information of 2-hop neighbors during the construction of CDS. Thus, each node also consumes energy. In addition, for EECCP, the smaller sleeping time in each round should increase the number of control messages and consume more energy. Therefore, the round interval have an impact on the energy consumption of the network. 
Fig. 6 shows the relationship among the deployed sensor nodes, the round interval and control overhead. The control overhead is calculated as the ratio of energy consumption in the sending and receiving th e control messages to the total of energy consumption in the network. From figure 6, the control overhead is relatively For instance, for a network with 800 sensors, the control overhead is about 15% when the round interval is 5 TDMA frames, and about 7% when the round interval is 20 TDMA frames. Another observation is that a denser network tends to have larger control overhead. This is because a denser network has to exchange more messages to turn off more sensors for same coverage ratio. The increase of control overhead due to the increase of the network density, however, is not very large when the round interval is long. This demonstrates that although the network density has an impact on the control overhead, the overhead can be effectively controlled by setting a long round interval. In this paper, we studied the area coverage property of minimal dominating set, and established the relationship between point coverage and area coverage, and derive the upper and lower bound that point coverage is equivalent to area coverage in random geometric graphs. Based on the analytical results and Rule K algorithm, EECCP protocol is proposed. The experiment studies show that the proposed EECCP protocol can indeed provide comparable coverage using the similar number of working nodes as compared to other location-based so lutions. EECCP protocol can effectively maintain both high quality sensing coverage and connectivity for a long time. Acknowledgments.
