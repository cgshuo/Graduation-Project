 In this report, we summarize the research issues, contents, and outcomes of the two recent workshops on Mining Multi-ple Information Sources (MMIS-07, 08) collocated with the 13th and the 14th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-07 and KDD-08). We first summarize the research issues and topics which in workshop co-chairs X  view are the major challenges for mining multiple information sources. Then we briefly in-troduce the content of the contributed papers in two years X  program, along with the introduction to three keynote talks given by the invited speakers.
 Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery, Multiple Information Sources, Multi-Source Data Mining The first ACM International Workshop on Mining Multi-ple Information Sources (MMIS) was organized and collo-cated with the 13th ACM KDD Conference on August 12 2007 in San Jose, CA. The main challenges identified by the workshop co-chairs, then, were threefold: (1) how to effi-ciently identify quality knowledge from a single data source, where patterns reveal local knowledge for each particular data repository, commonly referred to as local patterns ; (2) how to integrate and unify multiple information sources into one single view such that previous unseen patterns can be discovered, commonly referred to as global patterns ; and (3) how to discover the relationships of the patterns hidden across multiple information sources, where the features of the patterns (pattern frequencies and their utilities) across different data repositories define inter-repository relation-ships, which we refer to as inter patterns . The program committee selected seven papers which covered multi-source data mining applications and solutions from traditional ma-chine learning, business intelligence, life science, and soft-ware engineering.
 After the organization of the MMIS-07, the workshop co-chairs expanded the themes of the multi-source mining to address broader areas of multi-source data mining challenges. Such as data integration for multiple information sources, clustering multi-source data, supervised learning with mul-tiple data sources, association rule mining and stream data mining under multi-source data environments. Such changes helped the workshop co-chairs successfully organized the sec-ond MMIS workshop collocated with the 14th ACM KDD Conference on August 24 2008 in Las Vegas, NV. The com-mittee selected six papers which addressed the multi-source mining from clustering, frequent itemsets, and supervised learning perspectives. As data collection sources and channels continuous evolve, mining and correlating information from multiple informa-tion sources has become a crucial step in data mining and knowledge discovery. On one hand, comparing patterns from different databases and understanding their relation-ships can be extremely beneficial for applications such as Bioinformatics, Sensor Networking, and Business Intelligence. On the other hand, many data mining and data analysis tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering, can significantly improve their performance if information from different sources can be properly leveraged and if the min-ing process has the power to survey all the data sources involved.
 Unleashing the full power of multiple information sources is, however, a very challenging problem, considering that schemas used to represent each data collections might be dif-ferent (data heterogeneousity), data distributions and pat-terns underlying different data sources may undergo contin-uous changes (concept evolving), and mining tasks for each data source might also be different (mining diversity). Even though existing researches have demonstrated several ap-proaches to utilize multiple information sources, these meth-ods are still rather ad-hoc and inadequately address some of the fundamental research issues in this field: (1) Har-nessing Complex Data Relationship: Multiple information sources represent a collection of highly correlated data, is-sues such as data integration, data integration, model in-tegration, and model transferring across different domains, play fundamental roles in supporting KDD from multiple in-formation sources; (2) Integrative and Cooperative Mining: For heterogeneous information sources with diverse mining tasks, the mining should be able to unify all data to gener-ate enhanced global models, as well as help individual data collections to cooperatively achieve their respective mining goals; and (3) Differentiation and Correlation: Differenti-ate and coordinate the difference between data sources at the knowledge level is one crucial step for users to gain a high-level understanding of their data.
 The aim of the MMIS workshop is to bring together data mining experts to revisit the problem of pattern discovery from multiple information sources, and identify and synthe-size current needs for such purposes. Representative ques-tions to be addressed include but are not limited to: MMIS-07 workshop program consists of two sections (4 reg-ular papers and 3 short papers) and one invited keynote talk. The keynote speaker Dr. Xianghong Jasmine Zhou from the Department of Molecular and Computational Bi-ology, University of Southern California, addressed the prob-lem of functions, networks, and phenotypes by integrative genomics. In her talk, she discussed computational and statistical methods for integrative analysis of diverse ge-nomic sources, including microarray data, proteomics data, sequence data, and the text data. This includes the algo-rithms for network-based data mining and methods for the integrative analysis of cross-platform microarray data. The first section of the MMIS-07 program consists of the following three papers: The authors of the first paper ( X  X  Combinatorial Fusion Method for Feature Mining X ) proposed to use information fusion to improve the performance of a classifier by con-structing ( X  X using X ) new features that are combinations of existing numeric features. The quality of the fused fea-tures is measured with respect to the performance in clas-sifying minority-class example, which makes the proposed method effective for imbalanced datasets. In the second paper ( X  X ining Vector-Item Patterns for Annotating Pro-tein Domains Paper X ), the authors indicated that the di-versity of information collected in Bioinformatics and other application areas makes it increasingly important to develop techniques for associating data of different types. Conse-quently, they introduced an algorithm to find patterns in-volving items and vector data, and the proposed method was evaluated on yeast cell cycle gene expression data in combi-nation with domain annotations from the Interpro database and on time series data. In the third paper ( X  X ombining Mining Results from Multiple Sources in Clinical Trials and Microarray Applications X ), the authors proposed a mining framework to gather high quality information from hetero-geneous and multi-dimensional time series data and applied it to two important classes of biomedical data mining appli-cations: Clinical Trials and Microarray Gene Expressions. Experimental results demonstrated that the quality of the mining results can be continuously improved with the num-ber of data sets and/or metrics used for mining. The second section of the MMIS-07 program consists of the following four papers. The first paper ( X  X inding New Customers Using Unstruc-tured and Structured Data X ) addressed a very interesting and practical problem on identifying new customers for any sales-oriented businesses. In their paper, the authors demon-strated that the content of company web sites can often be a rich source of information in identifying particular busi-ness alignments. The authors proposed solution to employ supervised learning to build effective predictive models on unstructured web content as well as on structured firmo-graphic data. In addition, they also explored methods to leverage the strengths of both sources by combining these data sources. The authors of the second paper ( X  X ncorporat-ing Background Knowledge from the World Wide Web for Rule Evaluation using the Minimum Discriminative Infor-mation Principle X ) presented a methodology for augment-ing background information from an authoritative source on the World Wide Web to the subjective evaluation of as-sociation rules. In the paper, the authors focused on the problem of mining association rules in the medical domain, where background information automatically acquired from the MEDLINE database of biomedical citations was used to evaluate the quality of association rules extracted from an electronic medical records (EMR) database. In the third pa-per ( X  X ntegrating Projects from Multiple Open Source Code Forges X ), the authors presented a method for integrating data of the open source projects through project (entitie) matching across multiple code forges. The authors of the last paper ( X  X n Ensembled based Bayesian Network Learn-ing Algorithm on Limited Data X ) addressed the problem of Bayesian Network learning for limited data. In their pa-per, they proposed a sampling method, namely Root Nodes based Sampling, based ensemble framework and component integration method to support BN learning (due to the visa problem, the authors of this paper were unable to attend the workshop and present their work). Similar to the last year, the program of MMIS-08 workshop also has two sections. In addition, we invited two keynote speakers this year, one from academia and one from indus-try.
 The keynote talk of Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan (from Virginia Tech) addressed the problem of harnessing multiple informa-tion sources using compositional data mining. The theme is to build a compositional approach to building complex data mining applications from simple algorithms, which will enable users to capture complex patterns as compositions of simpler patterns. Two basic pattern classes: redescrip-tions and biclusters, were addressed in the talk, where re-descriptions identify patterns within a domain and biclus-ters identify patterns across domains. Given a relational database and its schema, the schema can be automatically compiled into a compositional data mining program, and compositional patterns can be efficiently computed without  X  X asteful X  data mining.
 The second keynote speaker Dr. Haixun Wang (from IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center) addressed the prob-lem of resource allocation in mining multiple data streams, namely load shedding in stream process. Due to the large volume and the high speed of streaming data, mining algo-rithms must cope with the effects of system overload. How to realize maximum mining benefits under resource constraints becomes a challenging task. In his talk, Dr. Wang proposed a load shedding scheme for classifying multiple data streams with focus the following two problems: i) how to classify data that are dropped by the load shedding scheme? and ii) how to decide when to drop data from a stream? The proposed method uses a quality of decision (QoD) metric to measure the level of uncertainty in classification when exact feature values of the data are not available because of load shedding. A Markov model is used to predict the distribu-tion of feature values and we make classification decisions us-ing the predicted values and the QoD metric. Consequently, resources are allocated among multiple data streams to max-imize the quality of classification decisions.
 The first section of the MMIS-08 program consists of the following three papers: The work reported in the first paper ( X  X ignalling Poten-tial Adverse Drug Reactions from Multiple Administrative Health Databases X ) was motivated by the real-world chal-lenge of detecting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), which is a leading cause of hospitalization and death worldwide, from multiple administrative health databases. To signal un-expected and infrequent patterns characteristic of ADRs, the authors proposed to discover Unexpected Temporal As-sociation Rules and further suggested the corresponding in-terestingness measure, unexlev. In the paper, the authors reported a new algorithm, HUNT, for highlighting infre-quent and unexpected patterns by comparing the rankings of the patterns based on the unexlev measure and the tradi-tional leverage measure. Notice that internet and Web have resulted in many distributed information resources which in general are structurally and semantically heterogeneous, whereas the heterogeneity itself has not yet been studied in a formal way, the authors of the second paper ( X  X n Explo-ration of Understanding Heterogeneity through Data Min-ing X ) provided a brief survey on various ways to categorize heterogeneity in the literature, and then performed a case study on detecting a specific class of heterogeneity in the setting of Semantic Web ontologiesCthe one that can be dis-covered by only data-driven approaches. The authors of the third paper ( X  X ulticlass Multifeature Split Decision Tree Construction in a Distributed Environment X ) addressed the problem of decision tree induction in distributed settings. The paper provided solutions to construct compact decision trees using multifeature splits for distributed data. The second section of the MMIS-08 program consists of the following three papers. In the first paper ( X  X  Novel Approach for Discovering Chain-Store High Utility Patterns in a Multi-Stores Environment X ), the authors argued that existing methods on utility mining were mostly designed for centralized databases but not suit-able for the environment with multiple data sources like a chain-store enterprise. Consequently, the authors proposed to discover Chain-Store High Utility Pattern that contains not only individual profit and quantity of items but also common selling periods and stores of items in a multi-stores environment. The authors of the second paper ( X  X arge Scale Security Log Sources Integration: An Ensemble Method X ) proposed an ensemble framework for large scale security log sources integration. The proposed efforts intended to solve two challenges in integrating heterogeneous data from dif-ferent monitoring sensors, this includes (1) how to unify the heterogeneous log data at the schema-level; and (2) how to understand the large scale instances with different encoding format? (Due to the visa problem, the authors of this paper were unable to attend the workshop. Their paper was pre-sented by one of the workshop co-chairs instead). In the last paper ( X  X pplying MDA to Integrate Mining Techniques into Data Warehouses: A Time Series Case Study X ), the authors complained that existing data mining lacks a modeling archi-tecture that allows analysts to consider it as a truly software-engineering process. Consequently, the authors proposed a model driven approach based on (i) a conceptual modeling framework for data mining, and (ii) a set of model transfor-mations to automatically generate analysis models for data mining. As a result, the analysts can concentrate on under-standing the analysis problem via conceptual data-mining models instead of wasting efforts on low-level programming tasks related to the underlying-platform technical details. All together, the papers selected in the MMIS-07 and MMIS-08 proceedings represent a subset of existing research on knowledge discovery from multiple data sources. The exam-ples and applications reported in the papers spanned numer-ous domains from life science, business intelligence, network security, software engineering, and traditional artificial in-telligence and machine learning. The algorithms proposed in the paper covered numerous data mining areas such as supervised learning, clustering, association rule mining, and data streams. This asserts that as data mining is rapidly be-coming a useful tool for different applications, the needs of collaborating multiple data sources for effective data mining are indeed a critical issue facing the data mining community. We wish to provide the MMIS workshop series as a platform to encourage a wide community of researchers to communi-cate and exchange ideas in areas of mining multiple infor-mation sources. We expect to continue this workshop in the following years and hope our efforts can eventually lead to a break-through to bring multi-source data mining to the next level. We are grateful to the members of the MMIS workshop pro-gram committee for their constructive comments in orga-nizing the workshops and finishing all the reviews in a very short amount of time. We also thank all keynote speakers for their support and excellent presentations. Finally, we would also like to thank all the authors who submitted their papers to the workshops. It would be impossible to make success workshops without their contributions.
