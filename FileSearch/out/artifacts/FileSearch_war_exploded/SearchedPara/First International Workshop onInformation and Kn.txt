 Several issues arise with management of content that is gen-erated in developing regions. Some result from linguistic diversity (as in India and Africa), some result from con-tent being available only in forms that are more difficult to computationally manipulate (e.g., handwriting, speech, and legacy digital text in nonstandard encodings), some result from underinvestment in language resources for the languages of these regions, and some result from increased contact between cultures that have different views regard-ing the proper use of information and information artifacts. Such issues warrant focused attention if we are to optimally leverage information and knowledge management to the ad-vantage of populations in developing regions. That is the purpose of this workshop.
 K.4 [ Computing Milieux ]: Computers and Society Information management, knowledge management, interna-tional development
Data management, information retrieval, and knowledge management have significant potential to contribute to so-cial development. This First International Workshop on In-formation and Knowledge Management for Developing Re-gions (IBM4DR) aims to bring together researchers and prac-titioners to identify those opportunities and to address the challenges that arise. Our twin goals are to help to iden-tify new applications for existing information and knowl-edge management technologies in developing regions and to inspire new research on problems that arise in developing region contexts.
IKM4DR will be a full-day workshop. The first session will include a keynote address and a panel discussion, which together will provide participants with a broad perspective
We aim to complement that activity with this IKM4DR workshop by crafting a venue that brings information and knowledge management researchers and practitioners together around these important issues.
This IKM4DR workshop has benefited from the perspec-tives of a diverse international program committee:
