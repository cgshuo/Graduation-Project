 Temporal information plays an important role in many research areas such as infor-mation extraction, topic detection, question answering, query log analysis, and Web search. Temporal information usually appears in Web pages as temporal expressions, which are typically divided into two types, namely explicit expressions, e.g., March 7, 2012, and implicit expressions, e.g., Today. The various forms of temporal expres-sions impose some challenging issues to temporal information extraction within the scope of Web search: (a) How to determine the right temporal information for implicit expressions con-found in a calendar, the implicit expressions need a transformation process and usual-ly a referential time is required. (b) How to determine the focused time for a Web page? A Web page may contain a lot of temporal information, but which ones are the most appropriate times associated with the Web page? This is very important to temporal-textual Web search engines which support both terms-based and time-based queries. resolve implicit expressions. For example, to determine the exact time of the implicit expression  X  X esterday X  in a Web page, we must know the date of NOW under the context. For the second issue, namely focused time determination, the difficult part is to develop an effective scoring technique to measure the importance and relevance of the extracted temporal information. For instance, suppose  X  X pril, 2011 X  and  X 17 2011 X . Therefore, even  X  X pril, 2011 X  rarely appears in the Web pages, it will still be the focused time for the page in case that there are a great number of extracted time words contained by  X  X pril, 2011 X . 
In this paper, the main contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows: (a) We propose a new reference time dynamic-choosing approach to extract impli-cit temporal expressions in Web pages (see Section 3). (b) We present a score model to determine the focused time for Web pages. Our score model takes into account both the frequency of temporal information in Web pages and the containment relationship among temporal information (see Section 4). GUTime is part of the TARSQI (Temporal Awareness and Reasoning Systems for natural-language processing task, it has a good performance in the extraction of expli-cit temporal expressions, but it does not perform very well in dealing with the implicit temporal expressions, especially in the case of lack of the document publication time. To improve the GUTime performance, we need to improve the reference choosing mechanism of GUTime. 
Most of the works on temporal expression normalization do not give an effective reference time choosing method for implicit times in real texts. More specifically, the pioneer work by Lascarides [2] investigated various contextual effects on different temporal-reference relations. Then Hitzeman et al. [3] discussed the reference-choosing taking into account the effects of tense, aspect, temporal adverbials and rhetorical relations. Dorr and Gaasterland [4] presented the enhanced one in addition considering the connecting words. But they are theoretical in nature and heavily dependent on languages. Currently, the static choosing mechanisms [5, 6] for refer-ence time are applied into some systems wi dely. Nevertheless, they are not adaptable to universal implicit times. Zhao [7] proposed a novel reference time dynamic-choosing mechanism which considers the gl obal reference time and local reference time respectively. 
In general, we can use the frequency of the temporal expressions to determine which the most relevant time is, but it does not take the relation among temporal ex-focused locations, such as the algorithm proposed by Zhang [8] and Web-a-where [9]. Inspired by them, we proposed a score model which takes the relation between tem-poral expressions into account to determine the focused time for a web page. The explicit temporal expressions can be recognized by many time annotation tools, employ the GUTime tool to extract explicit temporal expressions. The biggest differ-ence of recognition between the explicit and implicit temporal expressions is that the implicit temporal expressions need to determine a reference time, so choosing the right reference is the key to the identification of the implicit temporal expression. In this paper, we classify temporal expressions two classes. One is called Global Time (GT) whose temporal semantics is independent of the local context, and takes current context. Table 1 gives some examples of GT and LT in real texts. 
In our approach, there is a reference time table which is used to hold full reference time for the whole text, and we need to update and maintain it dynamically after each normalizing process. The time table consists of two parts: Global Reference Time (GRT) and Local Reference Time (LRT). 
In Fig. 1, we notice that different classes of time dynamically and automatically choose references based on their respective classes rather than doing it using the fixed value or the inconsiderate rule under the static mechanism. temporal expression, namely the term frequency of the temporal expression and the relevance between temporal expressions. Here, we define the score of a temporal score is related to the contribution made by all its children expressions. Table 2 shows the parent-child relationships among all the six time granularities we consider. compared to implicit temporal expressions, the explicit temporal expressions are more expressions. The explicit score of T i is defined as formula (1). ES(T i ) = TF ETE (T i ) + d * TF ITE (T i ) . (1) which are recognized as T i . TF ITE (T i ) refers to the term frequency of the implicit tem-poral expressions which are calculated as T i . d is the weighting factor. C , C 2 , ... , C n respectively, and we use the letter N to represent how many children unit T i contains. For example, if the granularity of T i is MONTH, then the value of N is 30 because a month contains about 30 days. Here, we use the factor  X  to represent defined as formula (2). 5.1 Dataset Two real data sets are chosen in the experiments. The first small data set consists of 3,148 People X  X  Daily news articles published in January, 1998. This data set is used to measure the performance of temporal expression extraction. The data collection con-tains 21,176 manually annotated Basic Temporal Expressions. 
The second large data set consists of 1,812,933 English news articles crawled from temporal information of the New York Times articles and use mean reciprocal rank-ing (MRR) to measure the effectiveness of the focused time extraction algorithm. 5.2 Evaluation on Temporal Expressions Extraction For evaluating our algorithm objectively, we compare the experiment data with other two methods on the same testing corpus. The first compared method applies the pub-nearest narrative time (NNT) by Lin [6] is taken as the second compared method. evidently. 5.3 Evaluation on Focused Time Determination We extract all the news articles in our corpus. It contains a total of 6,455,985 tempor-al expressions, and it includes 3,763,923 (58%) explicit temporal expressions and 2,692,062 (42%) implicit temporal expressions. More specifically, it mainly contains 3,157,156 DAY expressions (49%), 2,317,796 YEAR expressions (36%) and 959,747 MONTH expressions (15%). 
To evaluate the effectiveness of the focused time extraction algorithm, we random-sions. The parameter d in our algorithm is set to 0.5, the parameter  X  ranges from 0.1 to 1.0, and the step is 0.1. For each value of  X  , using mean reciprocal ranking (MRR) evaluation standard, we estimate the ranking result of temporal expressions in each news article. Fig. 2 shows that the reference time dynamic-choosing mechanism mance when  X  is set to 0.6. In this paper, we present an approach to determine the focused time for web pages. In particular, we apply the reference time dynamic-choosing mechanism to the temporal expressions extraction tool GUTime, which makes it more effective in recognizing. In addition, we make an exhaustive statistics on the temporal information of the New York Times articles. The reference time dynamic-choosing mechanism cannot be integrated into GUTime duo to the restric tion of application architecture of GUTime. So rewriting the GUTime and making full use of the temporal information, particular-ly the focused time, in web pages are our next research focuses in the future. Acknowledgement.
