 Recommender systems have received much attention in re-cent years, and they have been successfully applied in many different domains. With each domain come new constraints that require system designers to make choices about how to apply and extend generic algorithms in their context. Book-ing.com is planet earth X  X  number one accommodation reser-vation site. The accommodation recommendation problem that it needs to solve has several interesting and unique chal-lenges that make that a straightforward matrix factorization or a basic bi-linear model are not sufficient to provide the required predictions.

A concrete challenge is the high-stakes nature of select-ing accommodations. Whereas, say, a movie can be stopped after a few minutes, a holiday is more costly to stop. And whereas, say, an expensive television can often be returned, cancelling a reservation upon arrival leaves you with signifi-cantly less choice for alternatives. Because of this, users will interact with the recommendation system more and will re-quire guidance in understanding a market and preferences before making a decision. This effect is clearly visible in the data for instance by the number of re-rankings users make before making a final decision.

Another concrete challenge is that the inventory is not static and all decisions are made in a very specific context. For example when a particular user makes a selection not all properties might be available and the price of both the selected and alternative properties will vary through time. This requires model components that describe the choice process and keeps track of the context of each decision.
Other challenges include the mix of business and leisure bookings by the same person, the sparsity and long-tail ef-fects in all dimensions, the multi-level nature of recommen-dations that span from destination to dates and to hotels, the anonymity of users in many browsing sessions continued on different devices, and more.

In this talk, we will discuss several of the challenges we have encountered and solutions we have developed.
