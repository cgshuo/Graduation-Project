 fi ers, the former focussed on the prediction of the rainfall occurrence, and 1. Introduction many applications such as agriculture ( Wei et al., 2005 ), water resources management ( Yu et al., 2006; Kisi and Cimen, 2011;
Wu et al., 2009; Kannan and Ghosh, 2013; Salvi et al., 2013 ), hydrology ( Chen and Chau, 2006; Taormina et al., 2012; Chau et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2005 ) or facilities maintenance and control ( Benedetto, 2002 ), among others ( Tapiador et al., 2012; Muttil and
Chau, 2006 ). Currently, numerical weather prediction models have improved their performance, but they are still unable to provide accurate models for expected precipitation amount at high spatial and time resolutions. Different previous works have applied soft-computing approaches to overcome this dif fi culty, mainly based on neural networks and related approaches. These approaches have several advantages over global numerical models: they are much more easy and fast to train, they can be applied to data from a speci fi c point of measurement, and their performance is really competitive compared to global techniques.
 to be applied about 20 years ago ( Kuligowski and Barros, 1997; Navone and Ceccatto, 1994; Hall et al., 1999; Luk and Ball, 2001 ).
Some of these fi rst works applied multi-layer perceptrons to a set of predictive variables, carefully chosen to be related to rainfall, and with data from precipitation gauges (pluviometers) to obtain rainfall quantity ( Hall et al., 1999; Kuligowski and Barros, 1998;
Hung et al., 2009 ). The majority of these approaches considered short-term precipitation prediction, from 6 h to 24 h time-hori-zons, obtaining good results in the prediction ( Yuval and Hsieh, 2003 ). There are other approaches focused on long-term rainfall prediction and precipitation trends in a given zone, such as Philip and Joseph (2003) , where the rainfall trend in the southern part of Indian Peninsula is analyzed by using an Adaptive Basis Function Neural Network with a back-propagation training algorithm. In
Silverman and Dracup (2000) a multi-layer perceptron is applied to a problem of long-term precipitation prediction in California.
More recently, in Nastos et al. (2013) an arti fi cial neural network has been applied to model and forecast precipitation in Athens,
Greece. In Shukla et al. (2011) a neural network was applied to forecast precipitation during the summer Monsoon station in
India, using El Ni X o South Oscillation (ENSO) indices. In Manzato et al. (2007) a neural network approach is applied to the short-term forecasting of thunderstorms rainfall.
 been applied to problem of rainfall prediction and modelling.
In Ingsrisawang et al. (2008) a comparison of machine learning algorithms (decision trees (DT), neural networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs)) has been carried out for a short-term precipitation prediction problem in Thailand. In Wu et al. (2010) a hybrid SVM for regression with particle swarm optimization was applied to a problem of rainfall prediction. In Lu and Wang (2011) a SVM approach with different kernel functions is presented to predict monthly rainfall in a region of China. In Kisi and Cimen (2012a) a novel wavelet-SVM approach was applied to precipitation forecasting from past data. SVMs have also been recently applied to precipitation related studies, such as precipitation downscaling ( Tomassetti et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010 ) or stream fl ( Kisi and Cimen, 2012b ). One of the main advantages of machine learning classi fi ers is that they do not consider strong assumptions about the distribution of the training data, as opposite to other traditional statistical methods.

In spite of this huge work on rainfall prediction, there are not many papers focussed on the modelling and forecast of precipita-tion occurrence and amount together. There are two main articles dealing with this problem. In Harpham and Wilby (2005) several types of neural network models are applied to solve a problem of rainfall occurrence and amount modelling in northwest and southeast of England. The input data of this study are different measurement stations and also some large-scale climate predic-tors such as atmospheric circulation, thickness or moisture content at the surface, 850 and 500 hPa. More recently, in Hasan and Dunn (2010) a simple model for modelling rainfall occurrence and amount simultaneously has been proposed. It is based on a tweedy generalized linear modelling and the authors show that it per-forms well in modelling both occurrence and precipitation amount in Australia. Data from over 200 measurement stations spread all over Australia are used as inputs to the model. The use of joint models for simultaneous modelling of rainfall occurrence and amount is a hot topic in hydrology, since it provides information that can then be used in agriculture production systems and other applications.

In this paper we propose a novel system for simultaneous prediction of rainfall occurrence and amount, based on a hier-archical classi fi er, composed of a nominal and ordinal SVM classi fi er. First, a nominal SVM is used to set the rainfall occurrence model, that is, no-rain or rain prediction in the following 6 h. A second ordinal SVM is then hybridized with the previous nominal classi fi er, in order to obtain the expected rainfall amount (for those cases in which occurrence is predicted by the fi rst model) from a set of three different ordinal classes. The proposal includes a cost sensitive SVM model to alleviate the imbalanced nature of the problem and we simultaneously optimize the hyper-parameters associated with both SVM models. In addition to the proposed model, we use a novel set of predictive variables, which improve the classi fi ers performance in this problem. First, we consider signi fi cant meteorological variables from atmospheric soundings. We also include as predictive variable the synoptic con fi of the atmosphere (synoptic situation using Hess  X  Brezowsky classi fi cation), that, to our knowledge, has not been either con-sidered in precipitation prediction studies with machine learning techniques, in spite of its signi fi cance to establish precipitation regimes in mid-latitude regions ( Trigo and DaCamara, 2000 ). We also evaluate the importance of other predictive variables such as humidity and Equivalent Potential Temperature (both measured in vertical soundings), and of groups of these variables in the proposed hierarchical SVM performance. Regarding the objective variables, real rainfall data from a measurement station at San-tiago de Compostela (Airport), Spain, are considered to establish the performance of the proposed system.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: next section presents a review of the main predictive variables and precipita-tion data used in the study. We also state the exact modelling carried out, which includes the estimation/forecasting of rainfall occurrence and amount in the next 6 h. Section 4 presents the proposed nominal and ordinal hierarchical SVM for rainfall mod-elling. Section 5 presents the experimental part of the paper. Finally, we give some concluding remarks for closing the paper in Section 6 . 2. Predictive and objective variables used
Rainfall requires the existence of adequate clouds to produce precipitation. Therefore in order for precipitation to occur, three basic factors should be combined in an adequate way: condensa-tion nuclei, enough water vapor (moist) and vertical movements (updrafts and downdrafts as well as the atmospheric stability). As a consequence, data selection should cover all these three ele-ments so as to obtain a robust group of predictive meteorological variables related to the physical processes involved in the produc-tion of precipitation. Fortunately, an adequate number of conden-sation nuclei (such as smoke from industrial, particles of salt) on which water vapor undergoes condensation to form water dro-plets or deposition to form ice crystals are almost always present in the atmosphere. Then, it is only necessary to select meteor-ological variables related to the presence of enough water vapor and vertical movements.
 As has been shown in some studies ( Hall et al., 1999; Kuligowski and Barros, 1998 ), it is dif fi cult to determine the criteria that should be followed to select the best set of meteor-ological variables to use in machine learning classi fi ers, based solely on an understanding of the physical mechanism of pre-cipitation. Moreover, because precipitation is highly dependent on small-scale processes and local geography ( Applequist et al., 2002 ) a standardized pool of meteorological variables to forecast pre-cipitation would be dif fi cult to set. Nevertheless, considering the satisfactory results obtained in Hall et al. (1999) and Kuligowski and Barros (1998) using neural network approaches with back-propagation training algorithm, it is possible to choose a reason-able group of meteorological variables following similar criteria.
In our study we combine observed variables, taken from an upper air sounding station, and meteorological variables derived from a numerical weather prediction model, plus the observed precipitation.

As mentioned before, observed precipitation (target variable) data was obtained from Santiago de Compostela Airport ground automatic station (latitude: 42.89; longitude: 8.41; altitude: 370 m). We chose this target area because Santiago de Compostela is located in one of the rainiest areas of the Iberian Peninsula, without a dry season and with an average annual precipitation of 1886 mm ( AEMET, 2004 ). This station is part of the State Meteor-ological Agency of Spain (AEMET) surface observing network and reports all meteorological data every 10 min (it calculates the average value for each meteorological variable every 10 min). Although the data are available on a ten-minute basis, we consider the rainfall prediction in a time horizon of 6 h. Thus, the pre-cipitation data's temporal resolution selected for this study is 6 h. The meteorological data and variables employed for this study span the dates from 1 September 2009 to 31 August 2010, i.e., this study covers the 2009  X  2010 hydrological year.

We have used different predictive variables in order to predict precipitation occurrence and amount. First of all, data from La Coru X a (latitude: 43.36; longitude: 8.41; altitude: 67 m) radiosonde station is considered, which is the nearest upper air station to our study area. This station belongs to AEMET and its data are freely available on the Internet http://weather.uwyo.edu/ upperair/sounding.html . The second set is formed by the data from the medium-range global prediction model GFS (Global Forecast System) maintained by the National Center for Environmental
Prediction (USA) ( Kanamitsu et al., 1991 ). In this case, the variables were taken at the grid point closest to the ground station used in this study. Likewise, the reason for using this numerical weather model is that data from GFS are freely available on the Internet.
In addition, in this study we have used a novel predictive variable, trying to get better results in the forecast precipitation model proposed: the synoptic situation. As it is well known, some atmospheric circulation patterns promote precipitation whereas others make it dif fi cult. In fact, some recent studies have been devoted to determine the more probable weather patterns that cause rainfall as well as the possible changing in fl uence of the atmospheric circulation on surface precipitation ( Planchon et al., 2009; Jones and Lister, 2009 ). In line with this idea, we have selected the subjective Hess  X  Brezowsky classi fi cation ( Kysely and
Huth, 2006 ) of large scale circulation patterns as another pre-dictive variable. This classi fi cation has shown its ability to improve the skill of a predictive model in a problem of daily maximum temperature prediction using a support vector regression algo-rithm ( Paniagua-Tineo et al., 2011 ). In order to take into account water vapor content in the atmosphere, we have selected as predictors the meteorological variables shown in Table 1 , whereas the meteorological variables chosen to determine updrafts and downdrafts as well as the atmospheric stability are shown in Table 2 .
 describes the amount of rainfall in mm within a 6 h interval. This variable has been discretized in four classes in order to transform the problem into an ordinal classi fi cation problem. It can be argued that the problem can be tackled as a standard regression problem, however the large amount of rain values equal to zero is a handicap for applying any regressor algorithm. Moreover, the exact amount of rain is not needed by experts to take decisions. The rainfall amount is mapped to different classes according to
Table 3 , corresponding to the state of the airport runway condi-tions: considering European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) de -nitions on runway conditions, we have named the considered classes as Dry runway (no rain), and the three classes correspond-ing to rain as
The target value is the rainfall amount in the next 6 h, which has to be predicted from the input variables of the last 6 h. from three different sources: an upper air sounding station (i.e. observations), a numerical weather prediction model and a subjective classi fi cation of large scale circulation patterns. On the other hand, our proposal has been tested using two sources of information: precipitation measured by an automatic station and precipitation observed by Aeronautical Meteorological Observers.
It is a fact that observations and forecasts have inherent errors that in one way or another can in fl uence the fi nal results. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that all the possible errors are perfectly stipulated in the documents that describe these meteorological sources of information. Speci fi cally, upper air data and automatic stations comply with the requirements established in the manual on the global observing system published by the World Meteor-ological Organization, and the GFS model characteristics are out-lined in Kanamitsu et al. (1991) .
 regression, is a supervised classi fi cation problem in which there is an order arrangement ( ! ) between categories. That order is often induced by the problem nature, as it is the case because
C 1 ! C 2 ! C 3 ! C 4 (see Table 3 ). Ordinal classi fi ers exploit this relationship of the data with the goal of improving performance.
However, this performance cannot be measured as in nominal classi fi cation tasks. Here, in addition to the error rate, the magnitude of the error should be considered. For instance, if we have a new unseen pattern of class C 3 , an error classifying it as C is more severe than classifying the pattern as C 4 . For this reason speci fi c performance metrics should be used (see Section 5 ). distribution, where a signi fi cant amount of patterns are from class C (no-rain). Problems with this structure are commonly known as imbalanced classi fi cation problems, and they have to be tackled by using speci fi cally designed learning algorithms. 3. Background
This section brie fl y introduces the foundations of some com-putational intelligence methods that are necessary to understand the paper proposal. 3.1. Support vector machine for nominal classi fi cation
The SVM ( Boser et al., 1992; Cortes and Vapnik, 1995 )isperhaps the most common kernel learning method for statistical pattern recognition. The basic idea behind SVMs is to fi nd a hyperplane that separates two different classes  X  positive and negative classes. This hyperplane, w x  X  b ,isspeci fi ed by its normal vector w and the bias b . SVMs overcome the limitations of linear models by working with the patterns via a mapping function  X  which transforms the patterns representation in the attributes or input space X to a high dimensional Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). This is done by the reproducing kernel function used, de fi ned as k  X  x ; x 0  X  X  where  X   X  denotes inner product in the RKHS.

Then, the hyperplane can be given as  X  w  X   X  x  X   X   X  b  X  0, which yields the corresponding decision function: f  X  x  X  X  y n  X  sgn  X   X  w  X   X  x  X   X   X  b  X  ;  X  1  X  where y n  X  X  1if x belongs to the corresponding class and y otherwise. In this way, SVMs are based on a linear combination of the kernel function evaluated at the training data points.
The solution to the problem of fi nding the maximum separat-ing hyperplane is proven to be a convex optimization problem with a single global optimum. This optimization process implicitly selects a subset of patterns for building the model, which are known as support vectors . The initial formulation of SVMs is known as the hard-margin approach, which tends to suffer over fi Latter approaches included the concept of soft-margin in order to better generalize in the presence of noise, outliers or pre-labeling errors, which are common in real world problems. The soft margin is achieved with the inclusion of slack-variables  X  i in the optimiza-tion process ( Cortes and Vapnik, 1995 ).

As Vapnik ( Cortes and Vapnik, 1995 ) shows, the optimal separating hyperplane is the one which maximizes the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest points of both classes (called margin) and results in the best prediction for unseen data. This optimal separating hyperplane with maximal margin can be formulated as the following Quadratic Programming (QP) problem: min subject to y  X   X  w  X   X  x  X   X   X  b  X  Z 1  X  i ;  X  i Z 0 ; 8 i  X  1 ; ... ; where y i is the class of the input pattern x i . In order to deal with the multiclass case, a  X  1-versus-1  X  approach can be considered, follow-ing the recommendations of Hsu and Lin (2002) . The idea is to construct a binary classi fi er per each pair of classes and joining their multiple responses to obtain a fi nal prediction.

Finally, among other speci fi c issues, SVMs can have problems when dealing with imbalanced data (i.e. the number of patterns of each class signi fi cantly differs). This can lead to models that tend to ignore minority populated classes. As shown in Table 3 , the rainfall prediction problem is a clear example of imbalanced dataset, where the no-rain case is much more frequent than the rain cases. For dealing with imbalanced datasets, recently, the Cost Support Vector Classi fi er (CSVC) has been proposed ( Thai-Nghe et al., 2010 ). In this case, different misclassi fi cation costs are assigned to each class, so the total misclassi fi cation cost C is replaced with the sum of two terms: C C  X  and C being the soft-margin constants for positive and negative samples, respectively and I  X  and I the sets of positive and negative samples, respectively. Given a value for C , these constants are set in such a way that the total penalty for each class should be equal ( Ben-Hur and Weston, 2010 ), that is C  X   X  C = n  X  ; C  X  C = n C n  X   X  C n ;  X  5  X  where n  X  and n are the number of positive and negative examples, respectively. 3.2. Support vector machines for ordinal regression (SVOR).
The SVM formulation has been adapted to the ordinal classi cation case (SVOR). In this case, classes are separated by different thresholds b j and only one projection w , and the QP problem is adapted ( Shashua and Levin, 2003 ). In contrast to the binary case, where the class of the pattern is determined by the sign of the projection w T x , the corresponding real line will be split into different intervals by using a threshold vector b . This de a set of parallel hyperplanes with the same w and different thresholds b j .

In this paper we will work with SVOR with Implicit constraints of Chu and Keerthi (2007) (SVORIM). On contrary to the binary case, where only a pair of classes contributes to the error when fi nding the separating hyperplane, SVORIM rede fi nes the QP problem for considering errors from the samples of all the cate-gories when de fi ning each hyperplane. In this way, the ordinal inequalities on the thresholds are implicitly satis fi ed at the optimal solution ( Chu and Keerthi, 2007 ). The SVORIM model can separate multiple ordered classes by projecting patterns with a single hyperplane. The projected values are then transformed into class labels, by using a set of ordered thresholds which are also obtained from the training process. The main advantage of SVORIM over the standard binary SVM is that it can handle multiple ordered categories in a natural way, given that the patterns are ranked by a single projection function and the order between the categories is part of the obtained model.

There are other SVM based alternatives for ordinal classi tion, for instance the SVOR with Explicit constraints (SVOREX), also proposed by Chu and Keerthi, or the reduction to weighted binary classi fi cation (RED) framework to SVM (RED-SVM) ( Lin and Li, 2012 ). However, based on previous experience ( Guti X rrez et al., 2012 ), we selected SVORIM because it has a suitable generalization performance, whereas the training time is lower than other approaches such as SVOREX. Other ordinal regression approaches are brie fl y presented in Section 5 . 4. Proposed hierarchical nominal  X  ordinal SVM
This paper proposes to address the rainfall prediction problem as an ordinal regression problem that will be tackled by using a hierarchical classi fi er. This hierarchical classi fi er is composed of a binary classi fi er and an ordinal classi fi er. The binary one deter-mines whether or not rain can occur, and an ordinal classi model is applied to perform a fi ner classi fi cation of the predicted rain cases. In this way we establish a hierarchy between classes, being  X  rain  X  and  X  no-rain  X  in the top of the hierarchy, and the three  X  rain  X  subclasses in the bottom of the hierarchy. We call this method BInary and ORdinal Kernel classi fi er (BIORK). binary and the ordinal model with different subsets of the training patterns. For the binary model f  X  x  X  , rainfall classes ( C grouped as the positive class ( y  X  X  1) whereas the no-rain class ( C 1 ) is the negative class ( y  X  1) of the binary problem. The ordinal model g  X  x  X  is trained only with rain classes so the model of binary and ordinal models are adjusted independently with the purpose of getting a better fi t of the models to the data. In addition, since the current data set is highly imbalanced regarding no-rain and rain patterns (see Table 3 ), we have selected the CSVC classi fi er for the binary model, where the cost C  X  is weighted according to the criteria shown in Eq. (5) .
 tion, and then performing a second classi fi cation of the positive class patterns with the ordinal model. Fig. 1 shows the two models decision fl ow. 5. Experiments 5.1.

Pairwise Class Distances for Ordinal Classi fi cation (PCDOC) ( S X nchez-Monedero et al., 2013a ) with the  X  Support Vector Regression (SVR) as the underlying regressor (SVRPCDOC). All the methods except BIORK and SVM consider one single classi fi er for the four classes. BIORK assumes the hierarchical structure previously discussed, while SVM considers a decomposi-tion scheme of the multiclass problem in several binary ones. 5.3. Experimental results
Regarding the experimental proce dure, 30 different random splits of the dataset have been considered, with 75% and 25% of the instances in the training and generalization sets respectively. The partitions were the same for all compared methods. All the variables were property standardized and the SVM hyper-parameters have been adjusted by using a grid search in the parameter values space. The grid search consisted of a 5-fold validation procedure (exclusively using training data) with AMAE as the parameter selection criteria.

All the kernel methods were con fi gured to use the Gaussian kernel. For the support vector algorithms, i.e. BIORK, SVC, RED-SVM, SVORIM and  X  SVR (for SVRPCDOC), the corresponding hyper-parameters (regularization parameter, C , and width of the Gaussian functions,  X  ) were adjusted using a grid search over each of the 30 training sets by a 5-fold nested cross-validation with the follo-wing ranges: C A f 10 3 ; 10 2 ; ... ; 10 3 g and  X  A f 10 These sets of values are the ones used by the authors of SVORIM and SVRPCDOC for SVMs methods (see Chu and Keerthi, 2007; S X nchez-Monedero et al., 2013a ). In the case of RED-SVM, even though the values set are different to the ones used in the original paper, we use the same range to establish a cleared comparison. Regarding  X  SVR, the additional  X  parameter was adjusted considering the range  X  A f 10 0 ; 10 1 ; 10 2 ; 10 3 g as done in S X nchez-Monedero et al. (2013a) . For KDLOR, the width of the Gaussian kernel was adjusted by using the same range used for the SVMs methods  X  A f 10 3 ; 10 2 ; ... ; 10 3 g , and the regularization parameter, u , for avoiding the singularity problem values were u
A f 10 2 ; 10 3 ; ... ; 10 5 g . For ONN, the number of neurons in the hidden layer was selected by considering the following values, M
A f 5 ; 10 ; 15 ; 20 ; 30 ; 40 g . In the case of EELMOR, M value was chosen from the set f 5 ; 10 ; 15 ; 20 ; 25 ; 30 ; 35 ; 40 of iterations was fi xed to 50, the population size 40, and the crossover and mutation operators are the same suggested by the authors ( S X nchez-Monedero et al., 2013b ). Finally, POM does not have hyper-parameters.

Table 4 shows the generalization performance of the different algorithms in terms of mean and standard deviation in the 30 generalization partitions. The results correspond to the previous explained metrics: Accuracy ( Acc ), geometric mean of the Sensi-tivities ( GM ) and AMAE . For each metric, the best result is high-lighted in bold face and the second best result is highlighted in italics. Note that Accuracy alone is not enough to assess the performance of a classi fi er. As an illustrative example, a trivial classi fi er labelling all the patterns as no-rain class ( C an Accuracy performance near 69.04%. Observe that EELMOR have the best Acc performance, however it is not able to classify any pattern of one or more classes since GM result is zero. Regarding the proposed method, it obtained the best performance both in GM and AMAE , which are more suitable performance metrics for the rainfall problem nature.

To observe with more detail the performance of each algo-rithm, Fig. 2 shows per class accuracy for the train and general-ization sets. The results are shown in terms of mean (boxes) and variance (vertical lines). A general view reveals that, in general, the classi fi cation accuracy is worse in the rain cases. This makes sense since we are proposing a fi ner second classi fi cation in the rain classes, then, class overlapping and noise makes more dif train models with decision boundaries with accurate general-ization ability to distinguish between these fi ner classes. The second conclusion that can be drawn is that classi fi cation perfor-mance of upper classes decreases. From the classi fi er point of view this can be justi fi ed with the fact that those classes represent more rare patterns. Observe that this accuracy decay is soften in the case of BIORK.

To determine the statistical signi fi cance of the performance differences we applied several statistical tests. First, we used Kolmogorov  X  Smirnov's test (KS-test) at a signi fi cance level The result of each test for each metric ( Acc , GM , AMAE )concludedthat none of the methods follows a normal distribution. As a consequence, a non-parametric Friedman's tes t for dependent samples (because we have 30 dependent hold-out partitions) was selected to checkiftheappliedmethodsigni fi cantly affects the obtained results. The test concluded that these differences were signi fi cant with a p value  X  0 : 00. At this point there are several statistical tests which are candidates for performing the fi nal comparison. Some alternatives such as Nemenyi or the Bonferroni  X  Dunn tests are suitable when there are multiple methods and multiple datasets, however in our case we have multiple-methods and a single dataset. In this case, according to Dem  X  ar (2006) , the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for all pairs of algorithms ( Wilcoxon, 1945 )isa more appropriate option.
 Therefore, each pair of algorithms is compared by means of the Wilcoxon (1945) test. A level of signi fi cance of  X   X  0.05 was considered, and the corresponding correction for the number of comparisons was also included. The results of these tests are shown in Table 5 . The table includes the number of times each algorithm signi fi cantly outperforms any of the others (Wins), the number of times it is beaten by any other algorithm (Loses) and the number of times its results are similar (in the sense that no signi fi cant differences can be assessed) to those of other algorithm (Draws). These fi gures are studied for the three performance metrics. As can be seen, BIORK method obtains the highest number of signi fi cant wins and no loses for GM and AMAE . The results are specially good for AMAE which is the only measure which takes the two speci fi c characteristics of this dataset into account, i.e. skewed distribution and penalization of mistakes with respect to the ordinal scale.

Last but not least, speci fi c attention need to be focused on the comparison of BIORK to SVC and SVORIM for GM and AMAE .Both the descriptive results in Table 4 and the statistical tests in Table 5 show that BIORK is able to improve the results of SVC and SVORIM by the suitable application of two models in the proposed hierarchical scheme. The use of the Cost SVC de fi nitively helps the model to give more priority to the classi fi cation of rain cases.
These improvements with respect to SVORIM justify the proposal of this paper. 5.4. Discussion: system usefulness for improving airport operations seriously affect airport operations. When heavy or very heavy rainfall rates are expected, raindrops impacting airplane wind-screens can lead to a reduction of the visibility, and depending on the atmospheric conditions, windscreen wipers may not be able to fully cope with the rainfall rate. Not to mention that light, non-pressurized aircraft may fi nd the heaviest rain rates allow water ingestion into the cabin, the cockpit or the engine compartments with subsequent risks to electronic equipment. On the other hand, precipitation can lead to runway fl ooding, what may directly affect take-off and landing performances.
 each airport, the International Civil Aviation Organization, in collaboration with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), regulates the provision of meteorological services in support of airport operations. Speci fi cally, the Annex 3 to the Convention on
International Civil Aviation states that it is necessary to deliver speci fi c weather forecasts and warnings to meet the needs of operations at each aerodrome. Thus, aeronautical meteorological service providers prepare and disseminate speci fi c aeronautical weather forecasts for airports, such as TAF as well as Aerodrome Warnings: 1. TAF is the name of the code for reporting weather forecast information (  X  TAF  X  is an acronym of Terminal Aerodrome
Forecast). The TAF describes weather conditions that are expected to occur over a speci fi c period of time, that can range from 9 up to 30 h. The TAF is one of the most valuable sources for the predicted weather at a speci fi c airport. Among others,
TAF speci fi es the occurrence of precipitation. 2. Aerodrome Warnings give concise information of meteorologi-cal conditions which could adversely affect aircraft on the ground, including parked aircraft, and the aerodrome facilities and services. An aerodrome warning is issued when a speci weather phenomenon is observed or forecasted. Among others, accumulated precipitation is one of them.

Therefore, it is clear that aeronautical meteorological service providers need speci fi c tools to accurately forecast precipitation occurrence and amount at each speci fi c airport in order to deliver weather forecasts and warnings appropriated to contribute towards the safety, regularity and ef fi ciency of airport operations. Thus, the BIORK system proposed in this paper could be useful as complementary system to obtain TAF reports and aerodrome warnings of rain occurrence and expected rainfall amount. The good performance in terms of accuracy and probability of error exhibited by BIORK system makes it a very interesting tool in rainfall prediction (which is one of the most dif fi cult meteorolo-gical variables to be forecasted).

In future works we plan to improve the performance of the system by including speci fi c predictive and objective data from convective  X  non-convective precipitation and extreme events, with a larger range of applications in alternative facilities or cases. 6. Conclusions
In this paper we have proposed a system for simultaneous prediction of rainfall occurrence and amount. The proposed system is based on a hierarchical system of nominal and ordinal Support Vector Classi fi ers, the so-called BInary and ORdinal classi fi cation Kernel (BIORK) method, and we have also used a novel set of predictive meteorological variables. We have evalu-ated the proposed system in a real problem of rainfall forecast at Santiago de Compostela airport, Spain, comparing the BIORK system against several alternative computational intelligence methods in the literature. We have shown that the BIORK approach is able to obtain the best results in terms of different metrics and according to the Wilcoxon test, these results are signi fi cant. This system can be used as part of the airport weather forecast and warning system, in order to improve airport opera-tional performance.

Nevertheless some limitations of the proposal depict chal-lenges that may be considered for future work. Firstly, as revealed in Section 5 , classi fi cation accuracy decays for rare classes. As in other forecasting problems, rare cases are often hard to model. However, they used to be the most interesting patterns. Then, improving the detection of these unusual situations is a future work objective. This would imply both data processing and modelling. Secondly, regarding the BIORK method, the main limitation is the hyper-parameters optimization since four hyper-parameters have to be adjusted (typically, SVM methods have two). This implies a higher computational cost for the grid search, which can be a serious handicap in larger datasets. However, some ideas can be applied to reduce this computational cost, for instance, to reduce the number of values in the grid search or to use alternative parameters optimization techniques, such as metaheuristic search.
