 We describe a system that monitors social and mainstream media to determine shifts in what people are thinking about a product or company. We process over 100, 000 news articles, blog posts, review sites, and tweets a day for mentions of items (e.g., products) of interest, extract phr ases that are mentioned near them, and determine which of the phrases are of greatest possible interest to, for example, brand managers. Case studies show a good ability to rapidly pinpoint emerging subjects buried deep in falling in significance as they relate to the firms interests. The tool and algorithm improves the signal-to-noise ratio and pinpoints communications professionals and their organizations. I.2.7 [ Artificial Intelligence ]: Natural Language Processing, Text Analytics Algorithms Text Mining, Sentiment Detec tion, Trend Detection, Entity Extraction, Brand Manageme nt, Buzz, Communication, Competitive Intelligence, Reputation Management, Social Media Companies want to be able to quickly discover what the media, including twitter, blogs, and the mainstream press, are saying about a company or a product. Since popular products are mentioned thousands of times in the press, simple collation and summary of known mentions, wh ile useful, limits knowledge summarize the reports quickly and cost effectively is not always practical. We present in implemented system for what we term associated with products of interest. In our system, implemented as part of the Dow Jones product communication professionals, the user specifies a fixed set of discovered. We then identify  X  X nt eresting/significant X  phrases that occur near the terms of interest . Note that the products are phrases can be anything, and, in fact, often have never been seen that this paper addresses. As desc ribed in detail below, interesting phrases show a dramatic increase in usage, are mentioned sufficiently frequently, and are sufficiently specific to a given topic area. communication professionals answ er one of the most pressing questions for the firm:  X  X hat is th e next big threat to/opportunity for my business? X  A key challenge in today X  X  plethora of media content is to offer a tool that can help improve the signal-to-noise ratio by cutting through thousands of issues and opportunities emerging in relation to their or ganization and pinpointing the ones within a firm (e.g. Competitive Intelligence) can detect off-the-radar and emerging issues fast er and act quickly on hidden opportunities and possible threats to companies, brands, and people. A tool designed to improve signal-to -noise can be used to answer different questions and de tect different issues: The product based on the methodology presented in this paper was launched Q4 2009 and is now commercially available A variety of companies like Twitter have services like  X  X rendingtopics X  that track which phrases are most increasing in use. Recent work [9] has expanded such phrase tracking to by developing better methods for determining which phrases out of the hundreds of thousands of new phrases used daily (or weekly) are most likely to be  X  X nteresting X  to users. Our discovery method has the following steps: We present a detailed case study, which illustrates how our method works. Consider a user working for A pple computer. They might choose to monitor articles, blogs, and tweet s relating to the IT industry, to monitor a set of companies including Apple, Microsoft, HP, and and Macintosh. are extracted using an entity extraction system. The system automatically identifies and extracts key entities -such as people, dates, places, companies or other things -from the text data source, in multiple languages, based on queries crafted on the companies (e.g. Apple) or products (e.g. iPhone). Phrases occurring within a narrow window (&lt;100 characters) of the target products are extracted and counted. A phrase is determined to be  X  X xploding X  in a given corpus (for example, either the IT industry or specific to the iPod) if the phrase has: The goal of restriction 2 is to a void  X  one day wonders X , where an follow-up articles. Values for the parameters are customizable (e.g. at least eight occurrences, comparison against the past three weeks, and at least a 50% increase in mention frequency.) For a phase to be interesting and it should both be mentioned frequently, and should be relatively unique to the product with which it is associated. We trade off these two criteria by taking the ratio of the number of times a phrase occurs in connection with the product of interest to the number of times it occurs overall in the corpus raised to a power. We use (# mentions with phrase)/(# mentions overall) 0.95 . If the exponent were one, this would the product of interest. This fails to take into account the overall rare phrases being included. If the exponent were zero, this would rank the phrases by how of ten they occur with the product; this has the disadvantage of neglecting whether the phrase is specific to the product. Our power law formula gives a good trade-off between these. 2 terms identified are a combination of frequently mentioned terms such as  X  X TT: and  X  baby shaker X  and terms that are particularly exclusive to iPod. Of these top 10 terms, the one that is by far of application for the iPod which cries like a baby until it is shaken. Although this application was releas ed by a third party and not by Apple, it generated a tremendous am ount of press, and resulted in identify such potentially contentious problems that users are most eager to identify rapidly. In order to achieve high performance, a number of technical details needed to be addressed. The number of articles that their interest. Newspaper articles are often duplicates or near article from the newswire services such as Dow Jones Newswires or Associated Press (AP). On e could run duplication detection We have found, however, that most such large-scale duplications mainstream news we do not repor t potentially interesting phrases unless they appear days in a row. We had initially planned to use a more formal statistical method (e.g., a Bayesian model such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation; see standard probabilistic models re quire making strong distributional assumptions, and specifying at leas t as many parameters as our computational cost. Figure 1. Interesting terms found to be exploding in the preceding two columns: iPod over IT industry. The column labeled power law gives our interestingness result.

One can see that several topics of potentia l importance to HP have been  X  X oorjani X , is a financial analys t who made some widely reported comments about HP. The next three terms relate to a problem printing supplies. Each of these id entified terms is linked back to key documents from which they were extracted, so that users can determine what it is that people are concerned with. For example, HP can see what Moorjani is writing about the company, and soft, potentially effecting HP profits). _________________________________________________

The speed of decline is often proportional to the speed of the rise. Once a term has been drops back close to its pr e-exploding occurrence levels. Any data driven tool requires simp le visualization which can help issues and topics identified. This is even more important with this tool, given the large volume of content being processed on a daily basis. companies and products, interactive visualization of the results is terms. Figure 3 shows an example screenshot. One potential challenge when collating and collecting results is terms are identified. This is addressed by listing all the exploding terms in the form of a list view in the visualization with users able to review and deselect the irre levant terms from the view. In visualization to narrow their view of terms. Figure 4 shows an example screenshot with list view of terms. The cross fertilization between social and mainstream media is an important aspect for users. Emerging issues can predominate in one form of media and become viral. Users typically need a snapshot view of the media types that are driving the issue. Figure 5 shows an example screenshot of the split between mainstream and social media on an issue. Once users have understood the issue and the media split where the issue is being discussed, they prefer to deep-dive into the type. This lets users for their own opinion and views on the overall message being conveyed in the articles. Figure 6 shows an example screenshot of the product page where the users can select and read specific articles. Figure 3. Sample Dow Jones solution screenshot . chart term can read the complete article by clicking on the headline. The most obvious potential improve ment in our method would be emerging stories or topics, rather then emerging phrases. This can greatly reduce the number of phrases that the user needs to examine. Preliminary work in this direction shows that clustering phrases based on co-occurrence give s a sensible set of related phrases, and can substantially help with interpretation of what the phrases (e.g.  X  X oorjani X ) refer to . However, due to the sparseness of the data, even fairly widely covered stories still result in more than one or two clusters of phr ases; perfect clustering is not possible. identified in the proximity of each occurrence of the target product or company as an  X  X bser vation X  and clustered these standard TF/IDF weighted cosine measure. Because the number of observations can be quite larg e, we used a highly scalable streaming clustering algorithm [5]. cluster is taken to be the maximu m of the interestingness scores of the phrases in it.) The first cluste r relates to a set of comments on a financial analyst by the name of Dinesh Moorjani. Note that the cluster includes different versions of his name, phrases relating to computer demand and sales and c onsumer spending, and phrases identifying related terms such as  X  X rinting supplies X  and  X  printer  X  X eak spending X  and  X  X oft spending X  (which might, with  X  X ersonal computer demand X  a nd  X  X ersonal computer sales X  (which would require a sophisticat ed ontology of similar terms). Clusters two through five show any weakness of our clustering recalled lithium ion batteries.

Our work differs from the TDT work in the application to business, rather than military intelligence and, more importantly, in that our method focuses on supplies X  or  X  X haken baby X  are fa r more specific and informative which they are composed. Clustering at the level of docum ents, as is done in projects ranging from the TDT to Google News is a reasonable alternative to identifying phrases, offering potentially better recall due to lower sparsity. However, increased recall comes at some cost in precision. Regardless of whether trends are identified in phrases or documents, one needs to determine which of the many emerging topics are potentially significant to users. One cannot simply present all statistically significant emerging phrases or clusters, even using a good interac tive interface; there are simply too many of them. We process millions of unique novel phrases each year; analysts or users cannot even skim that many phrases. Earlier work on topic detection ignores the question of what is interesting or, like Google News, assumes that  X  X nteresting X  is synonymous with  X  X ccurs more X . By taking into account the increased frequency, highlighting those most likely to actually be significant. A number of researchers have a pplied more rigorous probabilistic models to the problem of iden tifying topic trends in document documents [2, 17] rather than looking in real time at emerging topics or emerging trends are likely to be of interest to an analyst. corpora we work with) fail to address our major concern: finding significant emerging trends. We presented a method of identifying significant emerging phrases associated with products, companies, or people of interest. The method is broadly applicable, applying to a broad Times, but also emerging social media (e.g. Twitter), and to phrases associated with politician as well as products. Our choice considerations, as we proce ss over 100,000 new articles per day from a heterogeneous mix of main stream (e.g., business news vs. financial news) and social media (e.g., blogs vs. discussion boards vs. tweets) sources. The product based on the methods described above is now being used by a number of clients, and is proving able to rapidly detect emerging stories of interest to the clients. For example, we were prototype iPhone (which Gizmodo acquired and publicly the case studies presented above, key phrases like "lost phone" are of high significance when associated with iPhone, but do not show up with related products. Several factors contribute to dete rmining what emerging topic or phrase might be most interesting to a given user. First, the topic or with products, people or companies specified by the user. Second, the use of the phrase must be significantly increased compared to interesting requires more than just seeing whether the phrase is distribution of words, new phrases are continually being seen. We observe that most such increased usages are not interesting to similar products. We presented an empirically verified formula specificity. A number of enhancements could be made to the above discovery process. We have focused on th e rapid identification of  X  X ot X  breaking concerns. Similar methods could be applied for more slowly developing trends (e.g. At kin X  X  diet,). The parameters in the algorithm can be modified to use the longer time horizons needed to capture these  X  X immering X  trends. No fundamental changes are needed. In fact, some concerns vanish: there is no longer any need to filter out  X  X ne day wonders. X  One could also supplement our sy stem by adding in sentiment (positive or negative) about the topics identified. One might expect stronger sentiment to corre late with higher interest from users. Note that because we identify specific short regions of text, we have the advantage that the sentiment would be associated with the news article as a whol e as is more commonly done with more objective measures of  X  X nt erestingness X  such as forecasting future rates of occurrences of identified phrases in media or communications of interest. One key question is how often one can identify emerging topics in social media before they are taken up by the mainstream press. Othe r work [6] suggests that most, but not all, phrases flow from the mainstream press to blogs. However, feeds from sources like tw itter are typically faster than those from mainstream media, and so may still provide useful leading indicators of emerging hot topics. [1] J. Allen.
