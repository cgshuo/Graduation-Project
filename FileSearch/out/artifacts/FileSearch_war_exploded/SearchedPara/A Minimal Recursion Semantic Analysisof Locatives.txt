Implementation In this section, we first describe the framework the grammar was implemented in. grammar. 6.1 Framework for the Implementation
MRS is a general format for representing different formal object languages and may be combined with different syntactic models. It has in particular been com-bined with HPSG grammars where it has been used in the large English Resource
Grammar (Flickinger 2002). HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994) is a unification-based fragment of an HPSG grammar to illustrate the analysis. This fragment was imple-mented in the Linguistic Knowledge Builder (LKB) system (Copestake 2002). The LKB system is an implementation environment for writing HPSG grammars. The grammar described by Copestake, Lascarides, and Flickinger (2001), are also encoded in the grammar. We refer to J X rgensen (2004) for details of the implementation. 6.2 Goals while having minimal redundancy in the lexicon. We furthermore want to under-specify ambiguities wherever possible.

NorGram is a computational Lexical Functional Grammar for Norwegian. It has been extended to produce MRSs, as part of the LOGON system (Oepen et al. 2004). applied to the English sentence in Example (7), we would get the analysis given in
Example (103).

Conclusion 1. Uniformity: Our analysis provides a uniform analysis of locatives, 2. Simplicity: We underspecify both mode ambiguity and the two roles of 3. Denotational Soundness: All our representations have model-theoretic expression, which may vary more unsystematically between the two languages. Acknowledgments References 270
