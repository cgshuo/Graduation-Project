 Web search has revol u tionized the way u sers obtain Web information by providin g lar g e q u antities of information efficiently and freely. Beca u se of the differences achieve the perfect balance between sponsored and or g anic search res u lts g iven the fact that sponsored search is a major so u rce of reven u e for commercial search en g ines. It is therefore important to g ain a g ood u nderstandin g of how people interact with search en g ine res u lt pa g es (SER P s), especially with sponsored links. information, have been widely adopted to explore search u sers  X  examination behavior. D u e to the behavior of examination is closely related to the decision whether u sers improve relevance feedback performance based on click-thro ug h behavior lo g s. In this paper, we perform an eye-trackin g analysis to explore the potential impact of sponsored search res u lts on u sers  X  examination behavior and st u dy the u ser  X  s decision process on the SER P s that contain sponsored search res u lts. 
There are already a n u mber of existin g eye-trackin g st u dies which looked into u ser  X  s interaction with sponsored search res u lts. For example, [11] indicated that attention allocation. [2] showed people behave differently on a same sponsored search Most of them only concentrated on the content-based infl u ence and rarely considered the presentation biases on sponsored links. search en g ines. By considerin g the u sers  X  online experience, most commercial search them even provide two different appearances of the same advertisement at different [4], it is reasonable to pres u me that the diversity in advertisement presentation styles may also lead to different u ser behaviors in a web search. Takin g it one step f u rther, we seek to u nderstand how u ser behavior (e. g ., examination, click preference) is affected by different presentation of the sponsored search res u lts and why certain existin g factors do not s u ffer from the impact of these differences. 
D u e to the existence of banner blindness [1], sponsored links may only have types of sponsored links, which are displayed on the top position of SER P s, mi g ht ads if there is no difference between the sponsored and or g anic res u lts? How do u sers chan g e their behavior if we man u ally vary the sponsored link  X  s style? Takin g this case into acco u nt, we also analyze the effects of u sers  X  examination and click behavior on presentation forms of sponsored links. 
The rest of the paper is or g anized as follows: we first present an overview of the related work. Then, we introd u ce the experimental desi g n for collectin g u ser behavior based on the eye-trackin g experiment, we provide several concl u sions in Section 4. A s u mmary of the experiment res u lts is presented in Section 5. 2.1 Web Search Behavior become increasin g ly pop u lar in many domains associated with u ser behavior research, [7] proposed an eye-trackin g approach to analyze u ser behavior on SER P s and to infer the relevancy of doc u ments in the Web search. Comparin g the implicit feedback and indicated that u sers tend to choose one of the top res u lts on the SER P s. They also proposed a site rep u tation bias in their research. [4] fo u nd that the existence of presentation bias may also lead to different behavioral biases on federated searches. res u lts. 2.2 Studies on Sponsored Search Results Beca u se sponsored search res u lts are becomin g essential and important components of the SER P s in c u rrent commercial search en g ines, considerable work has foc u sed on this re g ard. [11] reported that the u sers  X  vis u al attention devoted to SER P s depends on both the task type and ad q u ality, and the order in which ads of different q u ality were links into a sin g le listin g on SER P s. They showed that the combination of these res u lts does not appear to increase the clicks on sponsored listin g s. Even tho ug h they made no difference between sponsored and or g anic links on SER P s, the rankin g and mixt u re of these res u lts, which depends on the b u ilt-in al g orithm of meta-search en g ines, mi g ht not be widely representative of the web search. Essentially, the position of the sponsored and or g anic res u lts is relatively fixed and are separated rather than mixed in the major search en g ines. [1] proposed text advertisin g blindness, which may ca u se a u ser to skip ads on a web pa g e. F u rther, [2] foc u sed on the u ser  X  s with the SER P s that contained advertisements on mobile phones. Interestin g ly, they fo u nd that Generation Y did not exhibit banner blindness on mobile screens when most of them viewed both the advertisements and or g anic res u lts. 
Overall, most prior st u dies on sponsored links adopted a controlled experimental approach to characterize the vis u al attention or mo u se movements on SER P s. Nevertheless, to the best of o u r knowled g e, previo u s work rarely considered the presentation effects of sponsored res u lts and strictly analyzed the infl u ence, which or g anic res u lts. Considerin g the existence of presentation biases on res u lt lists (shown in Section 2.1), we are c u rio u s abo u t whether the presentation forms of sponsored links co u ld also lead to different u ser behavior. In this paper, we analyze the infl u ence of presentation forms on the u sers  X  examination as well as the click preference when different styles of sponsored links are presented in random order. We also attempt to determine how sponsored res u lt styles affect u ser satisfaction to provide a reasonable strate g y on the presentation of sponsored res u lts. 3.1 Participants Thirty-three participants, all of whom were u nder g rad u ate st u dents from a major a g e from 17 to 20 with a mean a g e of 18.5 and have vario u s majors in this u niversity. The g ender distrib u tion is split between 14 males and 19 females. Beca u se of the precision limitation of the eye tracker, not all of their eye movement data were available. As a res u lt, 30 of the st u dents that went thro ug h the calibration of correctness were finally taken into acco u nt. P artic u larly, all b u t two participants self-reported that the search en g ine we provided in this experimentation was their primary search instr u ment in their daily life, and they were very familiar with its operation. 3.2 Tasks P articipants had to complete the same set of 24 search tasks by u sin g the same search en g ine, which we assi g ned. Each of these participants was req u ired to solve these tasks initial res u lt pa g e comparable, we assi g ned an initial q u ery for each task. All of these q u eries were selected from real-world commercial search lo g s so that they co u ld reflect search en g ine in China. Then, the ori g inal SER P s related to these q u eries were examined one by one, and the SER P s that contained more than three sponsored links (i.e., to acq u ire specific information) in o u r experimentation. Moreover, we also provided a short description for each q u ery to avoid possible ambi gu ities. Several examples of the initial q u eries are shown in Table 1. 
We transferred the search sever that stored the static set of SER P s capt u red from the ori g inal search en g ine. This allowed u s to have a consistent initial SER P for each q u ery and to strictly control the experimental factor, which may affect the u ser  X  s behavior. After the initial SER P was presented, there were no restrictions on u sers  X  behavior on the search res u lt pa g es. Th u s, participants co u ld be free to behave on the SER P as u s u al in ways, s u ch as clickin g the related search links, j u mpin g to the next pa g e of res u lts, and reconstr u ctin g the q u ery. The aim of this desi g n is to achieve the real u ser appearances on search res u lts in a laboratory environment.

Unlike previo u s work that only concentrated on u ser behavior, we also consider the the initial res u lt pa g e after completin g a task session. They co u ld score their extent, these scores co u ld reflect the relative level of u sers  X  online experience across these tasks. 3.3 SERP Generation As we described in section 1, the appearance of sponsored links may be lar g ely different amon g different search en g ines. Even tho ug h this may lead to a wide variety of sponsored styles, there is still commonality amon g them. After observin g the layo u t of major search en g ines s u ch as Goo g le, Bin g , Baid u and Yahoo!, we classify the presentation styles of sponsored search res u lts into two cate g ories:  X 
With back g ro u nd color (WBC): this style of sponsored links ordinarily contains a partic u lar color back g ro u nd, which makes the sponsored ads more special and most widely u sed in contemporary search en g ines, s u ch as Yahoo! and Bin g .  X 
No back g ro u nd color (NBC): Compared with the WBC, sponsored links with this style seem to be more similar to the or g anic res u lts. Int u itively, there is no difference between the sponsored links and or g anic res u lts except for several u nobvio u s sponsored ta g s or brands. A g ood example of this is Goo g le sponsored res u lts. 
Dependin g on the analysis above, we foc u s on the infl u ence of these two types of sponsored link styles in this paper, which co u ld cover the majority of the application effects mi g ht be ca u sed by the different layo u ts of SER P s, it is important to provide a u niform interface for each initial res u lt pa g e. For this reason, we finally g enerate o u r sponsored links (WBC and NBC style) as a realistic component of the SER P s. 
In the st u dy, each of the initially fixed SER P s mainly consists of three top sponsored links and ten or g anic res u lts. All of the res u lt lists, incl u din g the sponsored links and or g anic res u lts, were capt u red from the same ori g inal search en g ines so that while the sponsored search res u lts were shown in different styles, both the content of remained consistent for the same q u ery. Fi g . 2 shows an example of the interface for the SER P s, which has a different sponsored link style. other elements on the SER P s that we do not expect. 
Followin g the pre-proced u re steps above, we implemented 48 initially fixed SER P s in total. Half of them contain WBC sponsored links, and the rest contain NBC sponsored links. The 24 tasks were eq u ally split between these two types of styles. For each of the participants, these two types of sponsored link styles were selected randomly and were shown alternatively for a specific q u ery. 3.4 Measurements The main g oal of this paper is to st u dy how u sers distrib u te their vis u al attention and clicks on different components of the res u lt lists when sponsored links are presented on SER P s. For this reason, both the u sers  X  eye movements and clicks are collected in o u r experimentation. 
We u se the Tobii X2-30 eye tracker, which is able to record the main indicators of participants  X  eye movements. Beca u se fixations are the most relevant metric for eval u atin g information processin g in an online search [8], we detect fixations by u sin g g aze d u ration above 100ms aro u nd a specific location. Additionally, to analyze the bo u ndary man u ally and recorded the fixation d u ration per res u lt doc u ment. we also capt u re and analyze u sers  X  mo u se movements d u rin g the search tasks, n u mber of clicks on sponsored links and or g anic res u lts, respectively. Moreover, u ser been disc u ssed in the previo u s section. O u r st u dy foc u ses on the potential infl u ence of sponsored search res u lts. We look into the u sers  X  act u al examination and click behavior on sponsored and or g anic res u lts and attempt to explore several potential impacts of sponsored links on SER P s. The followin g sections present this work in detail. 4.1 How do Users Examine/Click on Spons ored Search Results with Different compares the avera g e fixation d u ration on sponsored links that are displayed in WBC and NBC style. 
It is clear that the fixation d u ration on the NBC sponsored res u lts (  X  =2197.667  X  = 131.783) was consistently hi g her than that on the WBC sponsored res u lts (  X  = participants to view the sponsored res u lts when the NBC style was presented. From this bar chart, we can see the vis u al attention devoted to the sponsored links that were displayed in the NBC style is approximately twice as m u ch as that displayed in the more time distin gu ishin g the real or g anic res u lts from the whole res u lt lists beca u se of the extremely similar appearances between the sponsored and or g anic res u lts. 
Similarly, this behavior bias also ca u ses si g nificant differences in the avera g e click n u mbers, which are shown in Fi g . 4. We can find that the avera g e click n u mber on the NBC style (  X  = 0.165  X  = 0.027) is almost three times g reater than that of the WBC third-ranked res u lt receives the lowest click-thro ug h amon g the three sponsored links, it acco u nts for the hi g hest proportion from the total amo u nt of vis u al attention. It can be observed that participants mi g ht more easily reco g nize the search advertisements and avoid clickin g them when they spend more time examinin g these links. 
In concl u sion, the presentation forms of the sponsored links had a noticeable infl u ence on u sers  X  performance, incl u din g u ser examination and click behavior. When the appearances of sponsored links were similar to the or g anic links, it seemed click-thro ug h. In addition, we fo u nd that additional examination on sponsored res u lts did not absol u tely increase the correspondin g click-thro ug h or even reverse the click-thro ug h on them. 4.2 How do Users Examine/Click on Organic Results on A SERP with fixation d u ration for or g anic links that are broken down separately for the sponsored links, which were presented in the WBC and NBC styles. Compared with the infl u ence on the sponsored res u lts, there is a smaller difference in the examination of participants distrib u ted to the third ranked sponsored res u lt (mean time = 2383.958ms  X  = 904.634) was very close to that of the first or g anic res u lt (mean time = 2623.667ms  X  = 827.776). To a certain extent, this reflects the fact that participants were more likely to be conf u sed by the hidden appearance of sponsored links and devote more time to the examination to these links to eliminate misleadin g clicks. F u rthermore, u nlike the performance on the NBC style, we can see that participants tended to overlook the WBC sponsored links and foc u sed more on the first or g anic important factor that can ca u se u sers  X  banner blindness differently. 
Conversely, we fo u nd that the sponsored links  X  presentation affected the attention and clicks, the avera g e click n u mber for the or g anic res u lts in the NBC style (  X  = 0.150) is less than that in the WBC style (  X  = 0.177). Beca u se of the considerable distraction from the sponsored links, especially those whose appearances are similar to the or g anic res u lts, it mi g ht be easier for u sers to lose patience when examinin g and clickin g the links on the or g anic res u lt lists. Additionally, we fo u nd that u sers  X  banner blindness mi g ht be infl u enced by the appearances of sponsored res u lts to some extent. 4.3 How does the Task Type Affect Users X  Examination/Click-Through It can be observed from Fi g . 7 that most of the or g anic res u lts attracted more examination for informational tasks than navi g ational tasks, whereas the distrib u tion of vis u al attention was u naffected on the sponsored res u lts. These res u lts are consistent with the prior st u dies concernin g the effects of the task type, s u ch as [11], [13,14]. 
To take a f u rther step, we analyze the correspondin g click-thro ug h behavior We can see that the distrib u tion of click-thro ug hs on the or g anic res u lts (or g anic 2 to 9)also reflected this bias in which u sers allocated more clicks on the links in the informational tasks rather than in the navi g ational tasks. However, the distrib u tion of vis u al attention on these click-thro ug h was almost the same. For example, the click-three sponsored res u lts in navi g ational tasks, while it made u p the lowest proportion in the informational tasks. This indicated that the task type bias mi g ht also lead to the click-thro ug h of sponsored res u lts differently even tho ug h it did not have a noticeable effect on the distrib u tion of the examination on them. 4.4 How does the Sponsored Result Style Affect User Satisfaction? Beca u se the sponsored res u lt style ca u ses a different infl u ence on both the sponsored when the different sponsored link style was displayed. Fi g . 9 shows the avera g e score for the initial SER P s of 24 tasks, which contained the NBC or WBC style. 
The avera g e satisfaction score for the NBC style is 4.098 (  X  = 0.275), while the score for the WBC style is 4.188 (  X  = 0.259). Interestin g ly, u ser satisfaction seemed to be u naffected by the varied style of sponsored links in o u r experimentation. In other words, there was nearly no difference between the u sers  X  online experience on SER P s when the sponsored links were presented in the WBC or NBC style (r = 0.798 really discover the existence of sponsored links if their presentation styles were similar to the or g anic res u lts. This means that participants mi g ht re g ard these hidden advertisements as or g anic res u lts and mi g ht be more tolerant toward the misleadin g clicks on SER P s. Th u s, the presentation forms, which are similar to the or g anic style, may provide better strate g ies for improvin g the placement of sponsored search res u lts on SER P s. We presented a st u dy u sin g eye-trackin g techniq u es to explore the effects of sponsored search res u lts on u ser decision strate g ies for web searches. Different from most previo u s approaches that foc u sed on a specific presentation form of sponsored links, we systematically investi g ate how variations in the appearance of sponsored res u lts affect u ser behavior on SER P s. 
First, we fo u nd that the presentation styles of sponsored links have a si g nificant infl u ence on u sers  X  examination and clicks, where participants contrib u ted to both the sponsored and or g anic res u lts. There is a shape difference in the res u lt for the examination and click-thro ug h behavior when the different sponsored styles were presented. In partic u lar, we fo u nd that u sers  X  examination and clicks were not strictly correlated with each other on the same sponsored link style. In other words, the more click-thro ug h to them. 
Second, o u r st u dy showed that the or g anic res u lt entries capt u re more vis u al However, the u sers  X  examination behaviors on sponsored res u lts are not infl u enced by this factor, and there is still a real difference in click-thro ug h for the different types of tasks. Finally, based on the analysis into u sers  X  satisfaction on different interfaces of the online experience even tho ug h these res u lts mi g ht more easily lead to u sers  X  distraction on the SER P s. 
In the near f u t u re, we hope to extend this work to incorporate the effects of sponsored res u lts into a search click model and f u rther apply this to lar g e-scale data. Moreover, we plan to analyze the infl u ence of sponsored links on federated searches based on o u r findin g s in this paper. Acknowledgements.
