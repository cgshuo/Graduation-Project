 We propose a method for discovering the dependency re-lationships between the topics of documents shared in so-cial networks using the latent social interactions, attempt-ing to answer the question: given a seemingly new topic, from where does this topic evolve? . In particular, we seek to discover the pair-wise probabilistic dependency in topics of documents which associate social actors from a latent so-cial network, where these documents are being shared. By viewing the evolution of topics as a Markov chain, we es-timate a Markov transition matrix of topics by leveraging social interactions and topic semantics. Metastable states in a Markov chain are applied to the clustering of topics. Applied to the CiteSeer dataset, a collection of documents in academia, we show the trends of research topics, how re-search topics are related and which are stable. We also show how certain social actors, authors, impact these topics and propose new ways for evaluating author impact.

Mining text documents has many basic tasks including topic classification [17], topic novelty detection [16, 22], and Copyright 2006 ACM 1-59593-433-2/06/0011 ... $ 5.00. topic summarization [2, 14]. In particular, document sum-marization is often based on the discovery of topics (or themes). Methods applied to topic discovery in static docu-ments encompass probabilistic modeling [2], matrix factor-ization [9], and entropy optimization [1]. More recent work has been concerned with temporal documents using a col-lection of incremental and efficient algorithms [14, 16, 22].
While there are a rich set of choices regarding topic dis-covery in set of temporally related documents, our concern is when and where these topics evolve and how the topics relate, if any, dependencies with each other. In Fig. 1, for example, we illustrate the probability of appearance in doc-uments in CiteSeer of four research topics discovered using Latent Dirichlet Allocation [2], which is similar to previous topic trend discovery [20]. Figure 1: Probability of four research topics over 14 years in CiteSeer.

Some topics in Fig. 1 have been growing dramatically in popularity while other topics seem to be less popular, at least according to the CiteSeer database. A more interest-ing question is whether a newly emergent topic is truly new or rather a variation of an old topic? We address this by re-vealing the dependencies among the discovered topics. With the temporal dependencies among topics available, one can survey a research area from a ge nealogical graph of related topics instead of perusing the citation graphs.

One may assume that the discovery of pair-wise dependen-cies between topics can be achieved via document content analysis. A naive approach would be to cluster documents recursively yielding a hierarchical structure of topics. Alter-natively, one might define a similarity metric between prob-ability distributions (e.g. the Kullback-Leibler distance) if the topics discovered are represented in terms of probability distributions over words. In this paper, we introduce con-sideration of social factors into traditional content anlysis.
In order to interpret and understand the changes of topic dynamics in documents, we resort to discovering the so-cial reasons of why a topic evolves and relates dependen-cies with others. We hypothesize that one topic evolves into another topic when the corresponding social actors interact with other actors with different topics in the latent social network. Consider an actor a u associating a topic t i at time k . For some reason, this actor meets and establishes a social tie with actor a v who is mostly associated with a new topic probability. At a later time 2 k ,weobservethat a u is more likely to be concerned with t j rather than the previous t i . In return, t j has received a higher popularity than t i .When such a switch of topics in actors is statistically significant, we will observe an aggregate transition tendency from t i to of t i and t j moving towards different directions over time, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Such a trend is defined as transition be-tween topics. The dependency of t i on t j is measured by the probability of transition from t j to t i . Abstracted from the above example, our goal seeks to estimate the dependencies between topics using social interactions.

We consider this work as an attempt to bridge the dy-namics of topics in documents with the latent social net-work. In particular, we hypothesize the changes of topics in documents in a social network as a Markov chain process which is parametrized by estimating the social interactions among individuals conditioned on topics. The primary as-sumption is that topics in social documents evolve due to the development of the latent social network. This assumption has been supported in recent work [7] which experimentally shows that the information diffusion in a social network cre-ates new topics in the Web blog space.

Our contributions are: (1) a model of the topic dynam-ics in social documents which connect the temporal topic dependency with the latent social interactions; (2) a novel method to estimate the Markov transition matrix of topics based on social interactions of different order; (3) the use of the properties of finite state Markov process as the basis for discovering hierarchical clustering of topics, where each clus-ter is a Markov metastable state; (4) a new topic-dependent metric for ranking social actors based on their social impact. We test this metric by applying it to CiteSeer authors.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we introduce related research. The definitions and our problem framework are given in  X  3.  X  4 describes our probabilistic modeling of topic dynamics and the au-thor/topic dependency network. In  X  5 we introduce the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm for parameteriz-ing the Markov chain model.  X  6 interprets the metastable state discovery in the Markov chain as an approach for topic clustering. Experimental results are presented in  X  7 ending the conclusions and future work in  X  8.
A variety of statistical approaches have been proposed to model a text document. The unigram model models each document with a multinomial distribution and the words in the document are independently drawn from the multino-mial distribution [17]. It argued that each document in the document corpus has a distinct topic and developed mixture of unigrams based on the unigram. The mixture of unigrams models each document by considering the words in a docu-ment as generated from the conditional probability p ( w | where t is the topic of this document.

The probability latent semantic analysis (pLSA) [9] has each document generated by the activation of multiple top-ics, and each topic is modeled as multinomial distributions over words, which relaxes the mixture of unigrams model which considers each document as generated from only one topic. However, pLSA model uses a distribution indexed by training documents, which means the the number of param-eters being estimated in a pLSA model must grow linearly with the number of training documents. This suggests that pLSA could be prone to overfitting in many practical appli-cations.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [2] addresses the over-fitting of pLSA by using the Dirichlet distribution to model the distribution of topics for each document. Each word is considered sampled from a multinomial distribution over words specific to this topic. As an alternative, the LDA model is a well-defined generative model and generalizes eas-ily to new documents without overfitting. Recent work has been concerned with discovering dynamics in topics [14] and incremental discovery [16].
The social network analysis is an established field which proposes to analyze the relationships between social actors in a social network [21]. The evolution of the Web and the wide usage of socially related e-formated communica-tion media (e.g. emails, blogs) has promoted the interest in computational social network analysis, such as web com-munity discovery [5]. In the Referral Web project, social networks were mined from online information and used to help users target experts who can answer their questions with geographical proximity [10].

The above research mostly focused on static properties of social networks. However, social networks are dynamic in essence and evolve over time. The dynamic property of a social network greatly impacts evolution of the communi-cations content among its social actors, usually in terms of social documents [23].

The dynamics of social ties in a social networks can be shown by tracking the changes in large-scale data by peri-odically clustering data and examining the extracted tem-poral clusters [11]. Link structures can be used to predict future interactions among social actors [12]. Based on the assumption that the observed social networks are outcomes of a Markov process evolving in continuous time, models of the changes in the social ties [19] can be derived.
Despite of these traditional emphasis on structural ap-proaches, content-based analysis of social networks is only a recent trend [23, 7]. In fact, the content of documents shared in social networks, or social documents ,embracesthevalu-able information of both the changes of topics and the de-velopments of social interactions. Mining social documents to interpret and understand the changes of dynamics in doc-uments as well as the dynamics of social ties is becoming an important direction for computational SNA.

This paper attempts to bridge the changes in social ties with the changes in their communication patterns. We ad-dress the discovery of dynamics in social communications and how these dynamic changes link to the latent social in-teractions.
The primary goal of this paper is the discovery of pair-wise dependencies in the topic dynamics from a social document corpus. The definition of a social document isbasedona social network :
Definition 1. A Social Network (SN) is defined as a ho-mogeneous network (graph), in which each vertex denotes an individual, also known as a Social Actor (SA), and each edge represents a certain relationship between two SA X  X . A typical SN instances encountered everyday include the SN of authors, Web blog owners or Email users. The social ties between two SA X  X  can be recognized in a variety of ways depending on the application settings. For example, the collaboration between authors can be seen as one social tie between authors.

A SN in real world is not isolated. It is always preferable to perform the analysis of a SN by studying the correspond-ing information carrier (a Social Document), e.g. the Email text in Email SNs, which motivates and maintains the social ties in a SN. Social documents are defined as:
Definition 2. A social document is a document com-posed of a set of SAs in a SN for the purpose of exchanging information or soliciting future social ties.

A social document collection embodies valuable informa-tion regarding the social ties in the hidden SN and defines the social ties for modeling the topic dynamics in a social document corpus.

With the many document summarization tools previously developed [17, 9, 2], each social document can be seen as a mixture of topics. By a topic, we mean a certain probability distribution over the document vocabulary. The topic dy-namics refer to the series of topic with various strength of probabilities over time.
Given the definitions in  X  3.1, we outline our problem setting and the solution framework. Consider the evolution of topics in a social document corpus as a Markov chain. Per definition, the description of every finite dimensional Markov chain includes the specification of a finite state set and a Markov transition matrix. In the social document setting, we first recognize the topics from the corpus and consider each topic as a state in the Markov chain whose marginal probability can be estimated. As such, we need to address the estimation of the Markov topic transition matrix in the topic dynamic system spanned by a social document stream.

For a formal definition of the problem, denote the social document stream as a matrix DW X  R D  X  W ,where D is the number of documents and W the number of words. Define the matrix DA X  R D  X  A = {  X  i,j } D  X  A denoting the creators of these documents, where A is the number of social actors and  X  i,j = 1 ( d i ,a j ), an indicator function of whether docu-ment d i is composed by actor a j . Note that one document may have several actors. (For our experiments actors will be denoted as authors.) Using the summarization tools (LDA [2]) we transform DW into DT X  R D  X  T ,where T is the number of pre-specified topics. We assume that DT is normalized by row such that each document is a distribution over topics.
Using the matrix DA , a collaboration matrix A is ob-tained by setting {  X  i,j } A  X  A = A =( DA ) t DA ,where  X  i,j denotes the number of collaborations between social actors a i and a j if i = j and the number of composed documents by a i if i = j . Let the author set be  X . Using matrix and DA ,weobtainaset Q = { a , t | a  X   X  , t  X  R 1  X  T } , where a is the set of authors on a document and t is the distribution over topic specifying this document. Here each element q i in Q denotes an observation of a document. Now the problem becomes, given a set Q = { a , t | a  X   X  , t  X  R 1  X  T } and A X  R A  X  A that can be calculated from find a Markov transition matrix  X   X  R T  X  T that captures the dependencies among the discovered topics, i.e. determine a function  X  such that  X  =  X ( Q , A ).
In our setting, where topics are those discovered from so-cial documents , we propose a measurement method that ac-centuates the social interactions in the latent SN in order to estimate the topic transitions. The function  X  determines the measurement of pair-wise dependencies between topics.
Namely, we limit our search for  X  to consider only the social interactions mediating the evolution of topics. The assumption is supported by the intuition that topics created by close social actors in a SN sense[21] represent greater dependencies than those created randomly. For example, atopic t a is more likely to be dependent on t b if the social actors found in t a are tightly connected to those social actors found in t b . The idea here is similar to but different from that of collaborative filtering [15] in that now heterogeneous social ties are taken into consideration.
 Figure 2: Different dependency networks among two sets of variables: topics (squares) and social actors (circles) .

The estimation of Markov topic transition matrix  X  breaks down to a set of estimation tasks each in the form of P ( t i which denotes the probability that topic t j transits to t i in the Markov chain process.

In order to estimate P ( t i | t j ) using social ties in a SN prop-erly, we first set up the probability independence among two sets of variables: topics and social actors. Let Fig. 2 illus-trate our assumptions of the dependencies of variables. The topics are assumed to be of no direct dependency between each other. The social actors are assumed to be pair-wise de-pendent. For two social actors with no relationships, we can consider their dependency as zero. In Fig. 2, we show that three actors u , v and w are socially connected (solid lines). The two topics associated with them, T 1 and T 2 respectively, are linked (dashed lines) to all actors.

Following the above, consider the joint distribution P ( t i ,t j ) resulting from the interactions in the latent SN. In partic-ular, we consider the social interaction bounded by order two, i.e. P ( t i ,t j ) is constrained by single self and pairs of social interactions only, respectively denoted by P ( t i ,t j ) and P ( t i ,t j ) (2) . This can be denoted by: =  X  where a u and a v are social actors in the underlying SN.  X  is a smoothing parameter that weighs the importance of 1st-order social interactions. Eq. 2 assumes independence when
Note the assumption above regarding the order of social interaction can be relaxed to deal with higher order. We leave it to the readers to generalize Eq. 2 in high order case.
Multiple types of social ties can be considered as a ba-sis for determining the estimation of the topic transition probability. In this subsection, we provide a solution to the estimation problem based on social interactions, one typical social tie in a SN, with different orders. Denote the measure-ments based on 1st-order and 2nd-order social interactions from our social interaction considerations.

First, we consider the estimation of P ( t i ,a u ,t j )asa1st-order social interaction. We illustrate the 1st-order proba-bility dependence between topics and social actors in Fig. 3. The social actor u is present in both topics T 1 and T 2 . Figure 3: 1st-order probability dependence between topics and a social actor.
 We can estimate P ( t i ,a u ,t j )byEq.3: We derive Eq. 3 using the chain rule for a joint probability. Based on the assumption of the dependency network among probability P ( t i ,a u ,t j ) as a chain of probabilities:
The intuition behind the 1st-order social interaction is that a new topic may be initiated by the same actor who is present in an older topic but without collaboration with any other social actors.
 sidering the 2nd-order social interaction (a dyad in SN no-tation [21]). The 2nd-order probability dependency between topics and social actors is presented in Fig. 4. Here we in-troduce the pair-wise interaction in the latent SN as the motivation for the evolution of topics.
 Figure 4: 2nd-order probability dependence be-tween topics and social actors.

Again, consider the joint distribution P ( t i ,t j )asbeing constrained by the relationship between two social actors The constraint is captured in Eq. 1 by P ( t i ,t j ) (2) 2nd-order SN interaction constraints can be seen as the resented as: to Eq. 8 using chain rule:
Based on the independence assumption in Fig. 4, we arrive where P ( a u | a v ) can be seen as the conditional probability that social actor a u interacts with another social actors a v .
Note that the idea of relating the evolution of topics in SNs with the various orders of social interactions naturally coin-cides with the assumption that  X  X ollaborations bring about new topics X .

The assumptions we made about the independence net-works in 1st-and 2nd-order social interactions help the deriva-tions of Eq. 4 and Eq. 9. In traditional topic discovery methods where social factors are not considered (e.g. LDA), topics are assumed to be unconditionally independent from each other. Thus we see the assumptions of our approach as weaker and relaxed in conditions.
With the derivation for the joint probability of two topics with 1st-and 2nd-order social interactions, the estimation for Markov transition matrix,  X , becomes straightforward. In particular, we define  X   X  R T  X  T , where each element  X  i,j is the conditional probability P ( t i | t j ): where the transition probably is a directional estimate such will be normalized by row such that the row elements sum to one.
 Next we revisit the estimation of the joint probability cordingtoEq.3andEq.8,werewriteEq.2as:
So far we have given analytical formulas for P ( t i | t j )which are required for deriving the Markov transition matrix  X . However, we still cannot write out the closed form solu-tion from the observations for P ( t i | t j ) because of the un-known quantities in Eq. 12, such as P ( t i | a u ), P ( a u estimation of these quantities.
Here we estimate P ( t i | a u ), P ( a u | t i )and P ( a u to obtain the Markov transition matrix  X . Remember that our goal is to estimate  X  given the document set Q ,which we assume is already sorted by time.
 An algorithm that estimates a solution to the function  X  uses the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for the collaboration matrix A as well as the set of conditional prob-abilities required for Eq. 12. Let  X  be the author set. Fig. 5 illustrates the algorithm which has three phases: (1) initial-ization; (2) training, and (3) estimation.

In particular, A and T are matrices recording the co-occurrence of authors and author-topic pairs. We update T by adding the probabilities of each topic to the correspond-ing row of T (in step 5). The same idea is applied when incrementing the  X  X ount X  for each topic in step 7. Step 6 increments the count of author a i . Author collaborations are recorded by step 8 -step 9. Note that the estimation phase (step 10 -step 12) is not needed in training and can be carried out whenever estimations are required. We design the training algorithm in an incremental counting manner so that online estimations becomes easy to compute.
Let us now consider the analytical complexity of train-ing and estimation. For training, step 3 -step 9 consumes a computation complexity of O ( NLT + NL 2 ) on average, where L is the average length of author list on a docu-ment, usually a small integer. N and T are number of doc-uments and number of topics. The overall computational complexity to obtain the estimation of P ( t i | t j )viaEq.12 is further enhanced by a ratio of A for 1st-order and A 2 2nd-order dependence estimation. The P ( t i | t j )thencosts O (( NLT + NL 2 )( A + A 2 )), which is bounded by O ( A 2 Input: observation set Q = { a , t | a  X   X  , t  X  R 1  X  T } Output: estimations of P ( t i | a u ), P ( a u | t i )and P ( a u (3) for a , t in Q //topic-author counting (4) for a i in a (7) c T  X  c T + t (8) for a j in a //author-author counting

Now we have topic and topic-topic dependencies respec-tively estimated as the system states and the stochastic tran-sition probability of a Markov chain. We will explore other topic discovery using well established methods in Markov analysis [18]. This section describes the discovery of metastable states[3]inaMarkovchainasanapproachtoidentifying hierarchical clustering of topics.

Consider a Markov chain with its transition matrix P , state set S with the marginal distribution of S as  X  .Let A  X  S , B  X  S be two subsets of S . Then the transition probability from B to A with respect to  X  is defined as the conditional probability from B to A : where a , b are dummy variables denoting the states in S . Let A 1 ,..., A K be disjoint K subsets of S . We define a new K  X  K transition matrix W = {  X   X  ( A i | A j ) } ij as described above. Thus we arrive at another Markov chain with di-mensionality reduced to K in which each state now is an aggregate of the unit states from the previous state space.
Markov chains are called nearly uncoupled if its state space can be decomposed into several disjoint subsets A such that  X   X  ( A i | A j )  X  1for i = j and  X   X  ( A i | A j )  X  0for i = j . Each aggregate in a nearly uncoupled Markov chain M is called a metastable state of M . In our setting, a metastable state in  X  is a cluster of topics. Recursively discovering the metastable states[3], we may obtain a hierarchical cluster-ing of topics that capture their taxonomy. Identification of the metastable states in a Markov chain has been studied extensively [4, 3]. In numerical analysis, the identification can be viewed as a process which seeks the matrix permu-tation such that the transition matrix is as block diagonal as possible; a method [4] we also use.
For experiments, we use data from CiteSeer [6], a popu-lar online search engine and digital library which currently has a collection of over 739,135 academic documents in Com-puter Sciences, most of which were obtained by web crawling and the others by author submissions. The documents have 418,809 distinct authors after name disambiguation. Each document is tagged with a time-stamp giving the parsed time of the first crawled date.
We associate each document with the list of disambiguated authors [8]. Then we construct a co-authorship graph where two nodes share an edge if they ever coauthored a docu-ment. Next we perform breadth-first-search search on the co-authorship graph from several predefined well known au-thor seeds until the graph is completely connected or there are no new nodes. For seeds selection, we choose two re-searchers with a large number of publications in CiteSeer, Michael Jordan and Jiawei Han, from statistical learning and data mining and database respectively. The constructed subgraph of authors is further pruned by eliminating the authors with less than 50 publications in CiteSeer over the last fourteen years. We end up with a sampling of CiteSeer containing 3,974 authors and 108,676 documents spanning from 1991 to 2004. The number of documents acquired w.r.t years is illustrated in Fig. 6(a). We observe that the number of documents written by individual authors follows a power law distribution (Lotka X  X  law) [13].
We train a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model over our entire sample collection of CiteSeer by setting the topic number as T = 50, resulting in 50 discovered topics illus-trated in Table 1. The setting of desired topic number is small because we only work on a small subset of authors in CiteSeer (3,974 authors out of 418,809). Due to the limited space, we cannot present all the automatically extracted top words for all topics. Instead, we manually tag all the topics with labels using ranked keywords in the words.

For a more detailed description of some topics, in Table 4, we give a sample of six topics from Table 1 and their top words. Here the last row is manually labeled to summarize the topics. We are able to observe that LDA easily discovers the topics from a variety of areas 1 . note that Topic 17 denotes the affiliation and venues in
After the models are trained, we re-estimate each docu-ment with the LDA model to obtain the mixture of topics for each document. We further normalize the weights of the mixture components. It should be noted that this permits us to track the topic over time using some recently proposed online methods(e.g. [16]). We visualize the four topic dynamics w.r.t. time in Fig. 7. Given a year, the strength of a topic is calculated as the nor-malized sum of all the probabilities of this topic inferred for all documents in this year. The topics trend is an indica-tor of the trend of interests in social documents andinour setting, the research interest trends. Figure 7: Topic probability of eight topics over 14 years in CiteSeer.

The eight topics we choose to plot are (1) query process-ing (Topic 02); (2) svm learning (Topic 08); (3) digital li-brary (Topic 019); (4) information retrieval (Topic 026); (5) knowledge representation (Topic 032); (6) natural language processing (Topic 038); (7) neural network learning (Topic 046), and (8) Bayesian learning (Topic 050) (similar results are in[20]).. This raises the question of where do the re-searchers in a declining trend go (ex. neural networks)? Do they switch to new topics, and which topics? Our next goal is to automatically extract the dependencies among these discovered topics.
In order to explore the temporal dependencies among a group of discovered topics, we identify the Markov topic transition matrix via maximum likelihood estimation of the 1st-and 2nd-order constraints brought about by the hidden social interactions of authors (interactions of single social actors, or collaboration between social actor pairs).
The Markov transition matrices  X  are shown in Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 8(b) to highlight the extraction of metastable topic states. The values of matrix entities are scaled with the color intensity with the darker color denoting large value. Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 8(b) visualize the  X  with 1st-order and 2nd-order social relationship, before block diagonalization. which the keywords are university, department, email, con-ference, proceedings, etc which are also considered as topics since there was no deliberate removal of such information from the title/abstracts in CiteSeer. (c) Transition under 1st-order interaction after block diagonal-ization From Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 8(b), we observe that  X  is a sparse matrix, with large values in diagonal elements. The sparse-ness shows that these topics are separate though some tran-sitions among them exist. The large diagonal values indi-cates that the discovered topics in our case are relatively stable with mostly transitions to themselves. Authors in our CiteSeer sample prefer to remain in their own topics rather than switching between topics.

While the separateness among topics is for future investi-gation, we now take a closer look at the diagonal elements. Diagonal elements in  X  indicate the probability that an au-thor (and author pair collaboration as well) will continue to work on the same topics over time. This self-transition prob-ability shown in Fig. 9 allows us to rank the topics according to the authors reluctance to change topics.

Note that Topic 17 (affiliation and venue info.) is that with largest self-transition probability. The rational is obvi-Figure 9: The self-transition probability ranking of topics. Topics with high probability are more stable. ous since most authors tend to continue including their af-Table 2: Discovery of mTopics via block diagonal Markov transition matrix. # Topic IDs mT 1 1281018 19 23 26 32 38 41 mT 2 0572021 22 27 28 35 43 45 mT 3 6 25303637 40 44 mT 4 13 14 15 17 24 31 33 39 42 47 48 mT 5 3491112 16 29 34 46 49 filiation/venue information which was part of the meta data used. In addition, we can see that generally the topics with heavy methodology requirements (e.g. np problem, linear system) and/or popular topics (e.g. mobile computing, net-work) are more likely to remain stable. By contrast, topics closely related to applications are more likely to have higher transition probabilities than other topics (e.g. data mining in database, security) all things being equal.

Second, in order to investigate the sparseness in matrix  X , we perform metastable state recognition (introduced in $ 6), viewing  X  as the adjacency matrix of the Markov transition graph. In particular, we permute  X  in such a way that  X  is approximated by a block diagonal matrix. The resultant  X   X  is illustrated in Fig 8(c) and Fig. 8(d), on 1st-order and 2nd-order consideration of social relationship respectively.
The metastable states have in effect reduced the orig-inal Markov transition process to a new Markov process with fewer states and each diagonal block can be seen as a metastable state [3] which is a cluster of topics with tight intra-transition edges.

From Fig 8(c) and Fig. 8(d), we are able to initially break the two  X   X  into two major blocks, as noted by the dashed lines. Recursively, we can arrive at five smaller blocks, il-lustrated by solid lines, with each block as a metastable topic (or mTopic). Even though there exists a transition be-tween topics, the transitions are more likely to occur within a metastable topic rather than between them. Table 2 gives the list of mTopics and the corresponding topics.
Comparing Table 2 with Table 1, we observe that the topic descendants discovered readily capture natural intuitions of includes programming language, system and architecture; chine learning and numerical analysis; mT 5 are mainly sta-tistical methods.
With metastable topics (mTopic) discovered according to the approach introduced in  X  6, we are able to compute the accumulated transition probability among mTopics. Fig. 10 illustrates the uncoupled Markov transition graph among five mTopics we have discovered from the original stochastic matrix. Transitions with probability lower than 0.16 are hid-den from the graph to clarify the major transition among the five mTopics. Such transition probabilities among metastable topics are useful information for understanding the trends of topics and their dependencies in social document corpora.
Comparing Fig. 10 with the descriptions of each mTopic in Table 2, we can outline the major dependencies between mTopics. Out data indicates that mT 4 (numerical analy-sis) has been essential in these mTopics. And there is a transition to mT 5 (statistical methods) and which is tightly coupled with research in mT 1 (data management and data mining). Results also imply that researchers in mT 3 (net-works) will be concerned with mT 2 (systems) and that data management research is coupled with systems issues due the high mutual transition probability between mT 1 and mT 2 . Figure 10: The Markov transition graph among mTopics. Transitions with probability lower than 0.16 are not shown.

Next we look at the transitions within these metastable topics. Now that we know the topics within a metastable topic (mTopic) are very less likely to jump across mTopics, questions may be asked about how tightly the topics in the same metastable state are aggregated. We present the stochastic matrices of mT 1 and mT 4 in Fig. 11(a) and Fig. 11(b). Figure 11: The Markov transition structure in metastable topics
We observe that diagonal elements show the existence of high self-transition probabilities and that both matrices are almost symmetric, meaning the pairwise transition between topics in the same mTopic are largely balanced.
If one accepts the above interpretation of Markov transi-tions among the topics discovered in social document collec-tions, a natural question to ask is what author or authors cause such a transition between topics, evaluating their roles as prominent social actors.

In particular, in the CiteSeer data setting, we seek to pro-vide rank of authors based on their impact on the transition from one topic to another. We give a new metric  X  ( a u )for the author impact ratio of a u as measuring the difference between the obtained P ( t i | t j ) X  X , with and without a u .

Formally, consider how the transition probabilities change if an author a u does not exist. Denote the estimation of
The new author ranking differs from previous ranking by citation counting, currently done in CiteSeer, Google Scholar, and ISI, by now incorporating social interactions while ranking social actors. In addition, the new ranking is dependent on the specified topic pairs thus quantifying the impact of social actors w.r.t. certain field(s).

Next, we choose all pairs of topics from the 50 discovered topics in our data and test our hypothesis. This ranking of social actors captures common knowledge of the impor-tance of these social actors w.r.t. to different fields. Due space limitations, we select three topic transition instances ( T 2  X  T 1, T 49  X  T 26, and T 1  X  T 33) and present the corresponding top ten ranked CiteSeer authors in Table 3.
We observe that many commonly believed influential re-searchers in data management to data mining ( T 2  X  T 1), Bayesian learning to search engine ( T 49  X  T 26), and rule mining to bioinformatics ( T 1  X  T 33) are well ranked 2 . Figure 12: Ranking of authors w.r.t. their impact on the transition from Topic 02 to Topic 01.

Finally we give the distribution of impact over all authors in Fig. 12 for the transition of topic 02 to 01. The impact some researchers are not on the list because of no (indi-rect) collaboration with our seed authors and/or having the number of papers in CiteSeer necessary for our cut. distribution is a power law, indicating that only a few social actors have large effects over a certain topic transitions.
It is interesting to consider what can be obtained by in-vestigating social relationships with higher order. For that purpose, we compare the entropy of matrices [20] based on 1st-and 2nd-order social interactions. We can see that as the orders increase, the entro py of the matrix increases as well. This observation shows that the separation in social ac-tors generally decreases as the collaboration social network increases. In addition, we can see that high-order effects of the social ties does not really help identify topic transitions. Here we limited our consideration of social orders to two.
We develop new methods for relating social actors to their associated social topics and use them to derive topic trends. We show that certain topics are stable while others have a tendency to change over time. Certain social actors can beshowntoplaymoreimportantrolesthanothersintopic transitions.

In particular, we model the topic dynamics in a social doc-ument corpus as a Markov chain and discover the probabilis-tic dependency between topics from the latent social interac-tions. We propose a novel method to estimate the Markov transition matrix of topics using social interactions of dif-ferent orders. With the properties of Markov process with finite states, we apply the application of Markov metastable states as an approach for discovering the hierarchical clus-tering of topics and new topics. In addition, we give an experimental illustration of our methods using Markov tran-sitions of topics to rank social actors by their impact on the CiteSeer database. An initial evaluation of our methodol-ogy on authors as social actors presents other methods for author impact besides citation counting. Future work could refine our estimation of topic dependency, use larger data sets, derive social ranking of actors independent of topics, explore better estimation methods and generate new com-munities of actors. We believe our approach of introducing social factors to traditional document content analysis could be useful in other discovering the impact of social actors in other areas. [1] R.
