 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  Relevance Feedback Keywords: CLIR, Translation Enhancement (TE), Query Expansion (QE), Relevance Feedback (RF), ICE-TEA In cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), relevance feedback (RF) has been demonstrat ed to be effective in improving retrieval results, especially when reliable RF information can be obtained from users. Though query e xpansion (QE) is the leading RF approach in CLIR and it can take place before or/and after translating the query, it should not be the only possible RF method. In our demonstration, beside s an implementation of post-translation QE, we also implem ent a novel RF approach called translation enhancement (TE) and the integration of TE and QE. ICE-TEA is an interactive multilingual information access system with complete relevance feedback techniques. It is developed to utilize the RF information from users to conduct TE, QE, and the integration of them to improve CLIR results. ICE-TEA performs query translation based CLIR. It is built on top of Indri, a leading open-source monolingual search engine. As illustrated in Figure 1, the followings are the main functions of ICE-TEA: Translation Enhancement. As discussed in iCLEF, and as demonstrated by Google X  X  cross-la nguage search engine, returned documents in CLIR need to be translated back to the query language side so that they can be selected and examined by the users. The main idea of TE, therefore, is to extract intended translation relationships of query terms from the relevant document pairs (original returned documents and their translations) and then to enhance the query translation. Through a set of experiments, we design a TE me thod that acquires translation relationships in relevant docum ent pairs by word alignment obtained using GIZA++. Such transl ation relationships are used to re-calculate the corresponding translation probabilities of the query terms, so that the transl ated query obtained from the new translation probabilities will be closer to the true meaning of the user X  X  request. Query Expansion. In current version of ICE-TEA, we implement post-translation QE, which has been proved to perform better than pre-translation QE. Our system utilizes Indri's QE mechanism
