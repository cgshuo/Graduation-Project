 At some point of their life, most people have searched for medical information. An online medical search behaviour survey reports people between the ages of 18-34 go online to find healthcare information while people above the age of 50 seek for medical information online after consulting their physician [10]. As more health care questions and challenges arise, many turn to online resources to obtain information [15]. There is also a trend among patients today where they prefer to be more informed before, during and after consulting their physicians [3]. 
Previously, medical search engines were exclusive for medical professionals; other types of users were only passively exposed to medical information online [4]. Today, non-medical professionals are aware of many medical search engines and utilize them to search for medical based information. Me dical and health queries have declined as a proportion of all web queries, as the use of specialised medical/health websites have and treatment [16,11]. 
Searching for medical information is certainly not as straightforward as other types of search task. A health information seeker must know within the realm of language, the near specific location of the knowledge they seek [12] otherwise it is likely that a search might become unsuccessful. Medical terms have multiple sense and can be discussed from different perspectives [3]. Performing a medical search on a huge and information intensive domain such as a medical search domain where there are massive amounts of information available at disposal [3] could intimidate a non-medical professional. 
Little is known about the search behaviour of non-medical professionals on this domain. This information will enable medi cal search engines to categories users based on search behaviour and subsequently tailor relevant information retrieval strategies to enhance a user X  X  search session. 
In this paper, we present results of an exploratory survey of studying interactive search behaviour for non-medical professionals on Medline Plus 1 . To better understand the search behaviour of non-medical professionals we study query and browsing patterns using simulated work task scenarios. We attempt to report and classify non-homogenous search behaviour of non-medical professionals when searching on a medical domain. We believe these classifications will allow for better understanding of search behaviour of non-domain experts. The rest of the paper is our research methodology, in Section 4 we provide demographic details of our participants, in Section 5 we provide our results and analysis, in Section 6 we discuss our findings and in Section 7 we conclude the paper with future work. Domain experts search differently compared to non-domain experts. They prefer technical sites, complete tasks faster an d use specialised vocabulary [18]. Research has also found when domain experts perform a search task outside their domain or topic expertise only general purpose strategies were utilised [1]. There were obvious differences in site selection and search goal sequencing. Software engineers demonstrate distinct and unique search behaviour when searching on work-related tasks in comparison to when a search is performed for a non-work related task [5]. They issue longer queries, used technical terminology and acronyms in 66% of their work related tasks. Domain knowledge has also been found to influence search behaviour [1,8]. Users with domain knowledge used elaborate reformulation strategies in comparison to users without domain knowledge. Users without domain knowledge used simple stemming and backtracking modification techniques in a search session. Specific topic knowledge ha s also been found to influence search behaviour. Searchers with high topic knowledge expressed queries more effectively and found more search results [7]. non-self rated domain experts. Self-rated domain experts used significantly more unique query terms while non-self rated domain experts required supplemental features to augment their search experience [6]. Search experience also affects search behaviour. When an experienced searcher had little knowledge on a domain, more time is spent preparing queries and examinin g search results [8]. Search novices were more likely to reformulate queries and access websites through search engines rather than accessing websites directly [7]. 
Hu, Zeng and Niu [9] were able to determine the gender of a searcher simply by analysing words on a page that is clicked on and topic classifiers used. Similarly, Jones [14] was able to determine the age bracket of searchers based on queries used. Webber and Castello [17] conducted an in -depth study to relate specific search behaviours with demographic details. They found older and younger searchers use different terms to arrive at the same result page. Searchers from higher income per-capita brackets locate web site addresses using navigational queries. Demographic information based on age and ethnic backgroun d also helped to effectively determine the second query term for the purpose of query expression. 
In summary, previous work focused on the differences amongst domain experts session of a non-domain expert on an expert domain (i.e. medical domain). Nor is there research to relate medical search ing to demographic details. This deeper understanding will allow medical search engines to categorize search behaviour of searchers and provide relevant assistance during a search session. An interactive study such as this provides initial understanding of search behaviour and eliminates issues with noisy and data sparcity from search logs. We performed an exploratory survey on a convenient sample of 30 participants in a university setting. In this paper, to qualify a participant as a non-medical professional we ensured participants did not have any formal medical education. We utilized the following data gathering techniques in our survey: pre-experiment interview, simulated work task scenario, observation and post-experiment interview. Participants were told that the entire search session had to be performed on Medline Plus. Medline Plus was chosen as the domain of search as it currently only enables basic text matching techniques and spelling correction. This domain enables us to obtain true user interaction when searching for medical information without being affected by additional information retrieval strategies. The search was limited to Medline Plus as we did not want participants to perform medical searching on non-medical domains which could interfere or influence data gathered. There was no time limit for each search task and participants were told that they may stop searching once they have found satisfactory results or were not able to locate satisfactory results (user perceived satisfaction). Each participant was given an instruction letter to explain their involvement in the experiment. None of the participants had prior search experience on Medline Plus . Hence, we gave them some time to familiarize themselves with this medical domain.. Each participant had to perform 3 searches using simulated work task scenarios. These scenarios were rotated for each participant. 3.1 Pre-experiment Interview The pre-experiment interview was used to obtain demographic details, information on general search experience, medical knowle dge and medical search experience. We asked participants to self rate their medical knowledge using one of three options: expert, average or poor. 3.2 Simulated Work Task We developed 3 (Task A,B,C) simulated work task scenarios according to [2]. We used simulated work task scenarios to study interactive search behavior as it not only invokes a common information need amongst participants but also allows participants to engage in the task. We developed clinical-based scenarios as this type of medical search is typically performed by non-medical professionals. We provide the scenario for Task A, B and C in Figures 1,2 and 3. Task A describes a common health complain amongst young and old adults in a surveyed health clinic. Task B describes a prevalent health condition surveyed at a public hospital and Task C describes a condition experienced by one of out of 25 children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Each work task focuses on different medical topics to provide variety. Each work task also invokes several search goals within a search session. 3.3 Observation We observed the following query activities: the number of queries issued, the type of query issued (medical/non-medical), usage of query operators, ineffective queries (queries which returned no search results), length of the query (number of terms) and query re-issues (exact). We also observed the following search results evaluation behavior: number of search results clicked, sub-links clicked and going beyond the first page of results. We also kept track of unsuccessful search session (users ended These observations were performed for each task. 3.4 Post-experiment Interview The post experiment interview took place after participants completed each individual search task. At this stage, we obtained feedback from the search session. There were 30 participants in our experiment. There were 16 female participants and the rest were males. The average age of was 33.7 years (SD=9.6). The youngest participant was 19 and the oldest was 57 years. Participants ranged from undergraduate students from the business and information technology discipline (13.3%) and post-graduate students from the information technology, business and health sciences discipline (40%). Other participants include industry researchers, university lecturers, managers, consultants and retirees with undergraduate or/and post-graduate degrees in the following disciplines: Physics, Business, Health Science, Information Technology, Bio-medical and Engineering. 30% of participants who were working professionals had postgraduate education. Participants were of different nationalities: 60% of participants were Malaysians, 6% were from the Middle East, 6% were Sri Lankans, and the remaining 28% were made up of Indonesians, Burmese, Africans, Japanese, Indians and Bangladeshi. 
The average general search experience was 10.3 years (SD=3.5). The most experienced searcher had been searching on the Internet for 16 years and the least experienced searcher had been searching on the Internet for 2 years. 67% of participants self rated their medical know ledge as average, 27% self-rated their medical knowledge as poor and 6% self-rated their medical knowledge as expert. Only 2 participants had never searched for medical information. The rest have searched for medical information using general search engines or medical search engines. 9 participants had searched for medical information using medical search engines. The average search experience on a medical search engine was 6.2 years (SD=3.5). The minimum and maximum time participants had searched on a medical search engine was 2 and 12 years respectively. Other participants who had been searching for medical information on general search engines had been doing so for an average of 9.9 years (SD=3.5). The least experienced medical searcher on a general search engine had been doing so for one year and the most experienced searcher had been doing so for 10 years. 
Participants from the health sciences and biomedical discipline performed medical searches on an average of 3 hours per day. Typically they searched for research articles and treatment options for clients. Other participants performed medical searching as and when there was a need to do so. Typically, they searched for information on diagnosis, medication options and general healthcare. We provide an overview of results from 90 search sessions conducted by 30 participants using 3 simulated work task scenarios in Table 1. We analyze search behavior based on querying behavior, search results evaluation behavior and querying versus result browsing ratio. These search features were investigated as they represent typical interactions during a search session. 5.1 Querying Behavior In this section we analyze querying details in Table 1. 5.1.1 Medical Query Heading Database (MeSH) 2 database and not used to describe our work task. We provide samples of medical queries issued by participants: epilepsy, hydronephrosis, retrograde pyelogram, ureteroscopy, t uberous sclerosis, polycystic kidney . Our observation data show medical queries are only issued in the middle of a search session. Participants who issued medical queries discovered the medical query as a result of thorough browsing and evaluation of search results. This explains why a 
Note: A query may fall into more than one query detail category medical query is only issued mid-way in a search session. Participants continued to use the medical query as part of their query iteration process for subsequent queries. 
Participants who issued medical queries all had experience searching for medical information on medical domains (mean=6.2 SD=3.5) regardless of age and education background. Participants who issued medi cal queries did so at least once while searching on Task B and C. Other participants without medical search experience on medical domains did arrive at result pages that contained medical queries but did not  X  X iscover X  the medical query in the results page. Participant X  X  prior search experience on medical domains allowed for an active learning process to take place during the search session. These participants had the ability to acquire and use  X  X ew X  knowledge discovered during the search process. This factor led to the ability of expressing medical queries within this group of participants. We note medical queries were not issued for Task A. 5.1.2 Natural Language We define natural language queries as queries that form a complete English sentence. We provide samples of natural language queries: what is a stricture, what are causes measure for children with seizure, what is the care for swelling of lymphatic nodes on language queries observed in total. 
Whenever a natural language query was issued, participants did not click on returned search results. Instead, they continued to issue natural language queries or immediately ended the search session. In search sessions where natural language queries were issued, participants ended the search without arriving at satisfactory search results. 
In the 10 observations of natural language usage, 20% of these search session only consisted of natural language queries. In the remaining 80% of search sessions keyword based queries were issued first before natural language queries. Participants who issued natural language queries were above the age of 50 years. There were 3 participants above the age of 50 and all three participants issued natural language general search experience of 9 years (SD=6.5). These participants have never searched on a medical domain but have performed medical searching on general search engines (mean= 2.6, SD= 2.0). The use of natural language queries is usually related to novice Internet searches. Our results indicate an experienced searcher searching on an unfamiliar domain could also demonstrate search behaviour akin to novice Internet searchers. Domain specific search experience plays a more important factor in influencing search behaviour. The use of natural language queries in a search session had two implications. Firstly, a search session is coming to an end and secondly a search session was going to be unsuccessful. 5.1.3 Structured Queries We define a structured query as a semi-complete English sentence. We provide some examples of structured queries: precautionary measures for fitting, solutions to consequences for kidney enlarged, alternati ve for urine retention, pain kidney surgery treatment, treatment for swelling neck, relief for stiff neck, medication for lymph were between the ages of 27 and 32 regardless of education background. Only three participants out of 15 participants who fell within this age group did not issue structured queries. Participants within this age range had an average general search experience of 11 years (SD= 1.8) and medical search experience of 6.2 years (SD=3.7). 
Participants outside this age range did not issue structured queries but used keyword queries instead. Participants within this age group did not only use structured queries in their search session, but also issued keyword based queries (10%). Structured queries appeared mid-way of a search session. Once a structured query is issued participants did not revert to using keyword based queries. Structured queries were issued by participants within this age group for all three tasks. 5.1.4 Branching Away from Query Usage Some participants branched out from using queries to use MedlinePlus built-in search features such as Health Topics, Drugs and Supplements. After briefly using these features, participants continued the search process by using the Search MedlinePlus feature and did not continue to use these built-in features. Participants who used these features were mapped into two categories. The first category was participants with experience using medical search domains (mean=6.5 SD=0.7 ) and had health sciences and bioinformatics background. The second category was participants who have never searched for medical information. The post-experiment interview reveals other participants were aware of this search feature but opted not to use them. Participants with medical domain search experience and background in health sciences and biomedical used the same search utilities as an in-experienced medical searchers. 5.2 Search Results Evaluation Behaviour In this section we analyze search results evaluation details in Table 1. 5.2.1 Preference for Non-text Based Search Results Majority of participants favoured search re sults that contained only text information, while 26.7% participants preferred search results with images, embedded video files and interactive tutorials. In the post-experiment interview participants who had selected search results with these multimedia elements made comments to say they preferred such search results. Participants who favoured these results were between the ages of 27  X  32 had post-graduate education or were pursuing post-graduate education. Other participants outside this age group and education level did arrive at the same page but favoured text-based results instead. Multimedia based pages were education level favoured text results instead. 5.2.2 Interaction on Search Results Page function available on web-browsers. In all cases the searched item within the page was domain information. We provide samples of items searched for : URS, kidney stricture, fits, seizure, lymphatic nodes . This search behaviour was demonstrated for 70% of result pages that were clicked. Participants who demonstrated this behaviour either had or were pursuing post-graduate degrees in Information Technology, Biomedical or Health Sciences. 5.2.3 Medline Plus Features Used in Refining the Query Among MedlinePlus features used to refine search results were: Refine by keyword, results were displayed. Participants used these features to further refine returned search results. This behaviour occurred in 30% of search sessions. Participants who used these MedlinePlus features were either experienced medical searchers on medical search domains (mean= 6.2 years SD=3.5) or were students or post-graduate degree holders from the Information Technology field. The post-experiment interview reveal other participants were aware of these features but opted not to use them. 5.3 Querying versus Results Browsing Behaviour There were three patterns of querying to browsing ratios: high and equal querying to browsing ratio, high querying and low browsing ratio and low and equal querying and browsing ratio. Participants who had search experience using medical domains (Mean=7.5 SD= 3.1) demonstrated high and similar ratios for querying and browsing behaviour (87:97) Participants with more than 10 years of general search experience (mean= 13.3 SD=1.8 ) demonstrated uneven and high querying ratios compared to browsing ratios (16:5). Other participants who did not fit into these two categories had relatively low and almost equal querying and browsing behaviour (4:5). Our study dwells into the finer details of search behavior of non-medical professionals on a medical domain. We were able to identify non-homogenous search patterns amongst non-medical professionals. Our results are not without limitation. The use of operators, query re-issues, clicking on sub-links, going beyond the first search result page were too few to analyze. Queries without clicks and ineffective determine which category of user is prone to experience unsuccessful search sessions. There were two patterns as to how search results are viewed. Half of participants viewed results serially while the other half viewed results in parallel. In serial browsing results are not re-visited and the search session stops as soon as a satisfactory result is found or when participants decide to terminate the search. In parallel browsing, pages are often re-visited and compared. We were not able to classify this behavior to any particular category. self-rated medical knowledge, general search experience, medical search experience, nationality, gender and native language and only report classifications where participants matched 100%. Hence, gender, nationality, native language, self-rated medical knowledge did not affect a non-medical professional X  X  search behavior. 
There were many interesting outcomes of this research study. We were able to generally classify users into demographic groups based on search behavior. Medical search engines could exploit these findings to enhance a user X  X  search session. We suggest several personalization approaches based on our findings. The usage of a medical query suggests users with above average medical knowledge and search experience. Similarly this group of users could also be identified by the high querying to browsing ratio. Search engines could return pages that require higher level understanding to these users. Providing these users with medical query suggestions multimedia based search results. Hence, once a structured query is identified search engines should aim to provide multimedia based pages to these searchers. These pages should appear at the top of a page with some information on the content of the page. 
The use of natural language queries should immediately signal the retrieval strategy that the user is an inexperienced medical search and is having difficulty in the session. To enhance the users experience we suggest that retrieval strategies exploit the search strategies of participants from the Information Technology background or had prior experience on medical search engines (branching away from query, highlighting keywords in the results page, using query refining features). These comparison to other participants. We conducted an exploratory survey on medical information search behavior of non-medical professionals.. Our study is not without limitation, our results is limited to the population of study and does not necessarily represent medical search behavior of non-medical professionals as a whole. In addition, results obtained are specific to the domain where the search is performed. substantiate our findings. Similarly we would also like to study the search behavior of medical professionals and medical students. Acknowledgement. We thank participants of this survey.
