 Better tools for content-based access of video are needed to improve access to time-continuous video data. Particularly information about linear TV broadcast programs has been available in a form limited to program guides that provide short manually described overviews of the program content. Recent development in digitalization of TV broadcasting and emergence of web-based services for catch-up and on-demand viewing bring out new possibilities to access data. In this paper we introduce our data mining system and ac-companying services for summarizing Finnish DVB broad-cast streams from seven national channels. We describe how data mining of novelty concepts can be extracted from DVB subtitles to augment web-based  X  X atch-Up TV Guide X  and  X  X ovelty Cloud X  TV services. Furthermore, our system al-lows accessing media fragments as Picture Quotes via gen-erated word lists and provides content-based recommenda-tions to find new programs that have content similar to the user selected programs. Our index consists of over 180 000 programs that are used to recommend relevant programs. The service has been under development and available on-line since 2010. It has registered over 5000 user sessions.

Our system records TV programs continuously from seven national TV channels while skipping chat shows. We use MythTV [1] to schedule recordings into a FIFO cache of MPEG-2 TS files. Our data mining process starts with the extraction of subtitle data from the DVB recordings. We look for all possible sources for subtitle data: Teletext, DVB subtitle bitmaps and subtitles embedded in video frames us-ing OCR. Novelty word detection extracts unique and de-scriptive text concept word lists and stores this extracted metadata in a database along with the EPG metadata of the programs. The  X  X atch-up TV Guide X  and  X  X ovelty Cloud X  end-user services use extracted metadata to sum-marize broadcast news as well as other content.

Figure 1 shows our data mining process in detail. Novelty word detection uses machine learning and statistical data mining techniques to extract descriptive novelty concepts automatically from TV program subtitles. Since subtitles may be extracted directly from video frames, they need to go through language preprocessing to reduce errors and prepare the text for further analysis. Next, the words are divided into categories before they are incorporated into trained broadcast corpus and used in novelty word detection. Nov-elty word detection extracts unique and descriptive words for a single program in the Catch-up TV Guide service and a set of descriptive concepts to summarize a group of pro-grams in the Novelty Cloud service.
We capture TV programs from Finnish DVB-C broadcast channels and look for DVB subtitles or teletext if available. We also detect embedded subtitles from video frames if both DVB subtitles and teletext subtitles are unavailable. De-pending on the source of bitmap subtitles, we apply image morphology and histogram analysis to preprocess bitmaps for optical character recognition (OCR). For OCR we use gocr and tesseract software. For video frame embedded sub-titles, we post-process detected text data using error correc-It stores the frequencies of all the recognized words and con-tains over 274 000 generic words, 53 000 unique names and 5 000 abbreviations. The word frequencies in a program were normalized using respective ordinal numbers to even out differences between longer and shorter programs. Nor-malization was achieved by sorting the list into descending order by word frequency and by dividing the ordinal number with the number of words on the list.
Novelty word extraction carries out statistical comparison between a group of TV programs (hereafter subcorpus) and the broadcast baseline corpus. We used three time ranges (day, week, month) and 10 program genres (news and cur-rent affairs, cooking, nature, lifestyle, documentaries, sci-ence, travel, comedy, crime stories and all programs) to construct subcorpora. Each subcorpus contained a set of themed programs from which we wanted to detect novelty words.

We repurposed equations 1 and 2 from [7] to detect nov-elty words, i.e. words that are non-normative in a typical TV broadcast. Table 1 explains the used notations. These equations were used to compute novelty values for generic, name and abbreviation word lists. We also modified Eq. 2 to detect low frequency novelty words that are most unique for a single program. We did this by calculating the logarithm of the subcorpus and leaving out the weight balance multi-plier O i . The modified equation was used on generic words and as an outcome we obtained novel and unique informa-tion entities to describe program contents. These words were stored into a list of special novelty words.

We use the extracted novelty concept lists to add descrip-tive metadata for each individual program in a sub-corpus. In the demonstration we show how novelty concept meta-data is used to create semantic access to the parts of TV pro-grams in the Catch-up TV Guide service and how content-based similar program recommendations are carried out us-ing novelty concept metadata.
Novelty Cloud service provides a word cloud visualization that is generated from the extracted novelty concept words. In order to generate novelty cloud, word lists from novelty word extraction are combined to visualize novel concepts from generic, special and name word lists. To account for recurrence of novelty concepts over a series of programs in a sub-corpus, more frequent novelty words are given more weight in the cloud by increasing the font size for the most streams to find out if program content is relevant and inter-esting for their needs. Instead they can assess the relevancy of the information before committing to viewing the stream. When relevant content has been found, The Catch-up TV Guide enables easy access to the actual program content by providing links to the program X  X  web stream on the broad-caster X  X  site, if available. The aims of Catch-up TV Guide service are to give easy access to new and interesting con-tent inside TV programs and facilitate finding new and in-teresting TV content for on-demand viewing. In addition to program summaries, we demonstrate how extracted novelty concepts are used in recommending programs similar to se-lected program from the dynamically updating index of 180 000 TV programs. The service is first in Finland that is able to dynamically promote similar content across different TV channels using content-based techniques.
 Another prototype end-user service is Novelty Cloud [4]. It is a service that summarizes novel news topics from TV news broadcasts for a week or a month. It combines generic, special and name novelty word lists and generates a large novelty word cloud from them. Novelty Cloud service dis-plays novelty word summaries from a group of programs over a period of time instead of displaying individual pro-grams. It portrays an overview of news events and allows users to navigate overviews monthly or weekly from the re-cent events to the beginning of 2012. Figure 4 shows a Novelty Cloud for the week 4 of 2013. The most novel words in the word cloud are Katainen (Finnish prime min-ister), Turku (a major Finnish city), Million euro loss (2012 Helsinki European Athletics Championships), Algeria, Bor-der guard, Mali, church visit (Obama inauguration), trade union, Ice Hockey Federation, Islamic extremist etc. Users may click any word on the Novelty Cloud to retrieve TV pro-grams that have mentioned the topic during the time period. Furthermore, users may see the original news broadcast at the broadcaster X  X  site if the stream is still available. With the proposed design, Novelty Cloud service allows users to skim through broadcasts news topics for the past weeks and months in a quick and effortless manner. We have collected user logs of over 5000 sessions. The statistics of 1267 clicks show that selecting a novelty word in our Catch-up TV Guide service collected 51% of the clicks in the program summary. Key frame images had 29% of the clicks whereas program titles had 20%. Since 2013 Novelty Cloud service has collected 410 sessions with average click rate of 1.72 words per session.
We demonstrate our broadcast TV data mining system with two end-user applications that utilize rich text content in time-continuous video. Novelty concept extraction pro-duces semantic content descriptions that facilitates finding new and relevant information from dynamically updating TV program index in a content-rich manner. We demon-strate the applicability of our data mining system with new end-user services: Catch-up TV Guide for browsing recently aired programs and Novelty Cloud for quick overviews of broadcast news topics. Novelty word summaries were the most popular way to examine program content in our Catch-up TV Guide service.
