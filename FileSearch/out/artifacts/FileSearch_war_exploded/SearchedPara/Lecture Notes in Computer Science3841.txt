 It is our great pleasure to welcome you to Harbin for the 8th Asia Pacific Web Conference (APWeb 2006). The winter snow festival is one of the reasons to have chosen January and the setting of beautiful Songhuajiang Riverside. and practical aspects of W eb engineering in the Asia Pacific region. Previous APWeb conferences were held in Beijing (1998), Hong Kong (1999), Xi X  X n (2000), Changsha (2001), Xi X  X n (2003), Hangzhou (2004) and Shanghai (2005). the difficult and highly competitive selection of research papers. APWeb 2006 at-tracted more than 400 papers from 23 countries and regions. Industrial Program Chair Xiaowei Kan, Panel and Tutorial Chair Athman Bouguettaya, and Demo Chairs Yoshiharu Ishikawa and Haiyang Wang all contributed significantly to make an attractive program. We thank David Abramson, Ding-Zhu Du, Ling Liu and Justin Zobel for their keynote s as the highlights of the conference. lent conference and banquet places we re managed by Local Arrangement Chair Hong Gao. Publicity Chairs Chengfei Liu and Ge Yu promoted this conference. Treasurer Qing Li played an important role in financial management. workshops on emerging topics were organ ized, which were selected and coordi-nated by Workshop Chair Jeffrey Yu. The Workshop on Metropolis/Enterprise Grid and Applications (MEGA) was organized by Minglu Li. The Workshop on Sensor Network (IWSN) was run by Xiaohua Jia, Jinbao Li, and Yingshu Li. The Workshop on Web-based Internet Computing for Science and Engineer-ing (ICSE) was run by Jack Dongarra and Jun Ni and the Workshop on XML Research and Applications (XRA) was organized by Wei Wang and Raymond Wong.

 each submission by the Program Committee (with 148 PC members!) and spe-cialists recommended by P rogram Committee members, APWeb accepted 56 regular papers and 42 short papers (the acceptance rates are 14% and 11%, respectively). This volume also include s invited keynote papers, presented by four leading experts at APWeb 2006: David Abramson (Monash University), Ding-Zhu Du (University of Minnesota), Ling Liu (Georgia Institute of Technol-ogy) and Justin Zobel (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). Other papers in this volume include selected papers fo r special sessions on ICT advances for water resources management organized by Yanchun Zhang (Victoria University of Technology), industry papers organized by Xiaowei Kan (Ricoh Co., Ltd.), and demo papers organized by Yoshiharu Ishikawa (Tsukuba University) and Haiyang Wang (Shandong University).
 papers were compiled in a separate volume of proceedings, also published by Springer in its Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.
