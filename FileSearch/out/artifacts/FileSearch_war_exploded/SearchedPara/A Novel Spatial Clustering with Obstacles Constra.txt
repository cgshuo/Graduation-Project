 Spatial clustering with constraints is an important topic in Spatial Data Mining Spatial Clustering with Obstacles Constraints (SCOC).An obstacle is a physical object highway etc. whose impact on the result should be considered in the clustering constraints leads to incorrect interpretation of the correlation among data points. The some operation limiting conditions in the clustering process. In this paper, we mainly discuss SCOC. Handling these obstacles constr aints can lead to effective and fruitful data mining by capturing application semantics [3-8]. Since K.H.Tung put forward a clustering question COE (Clustering with Obstacles Entities) [3] in 2000, a new studying direction in the field of clustering research have clustering spatial data with obstacles cons traints have been proposed very recently: COD-CLARANS [3] based on the Partitioning approach of CLARANS, AUTOCLUST+ [4] based on the Graph pa rtitioning me thod of AUTOCLUST, and DBCluC [5]-[8] based on the Density-based algorithm. Although these algorithms can deal with some obstacles in the clustering process, many questions exist in them. COD-CLARANS algorithm inherits the shortcoming of CLARANS algorithm, which only gives attention to local constringency. AUTOCLUST+ algorithm inherits the limitation of AUTOCLUST algorithm, which builds a Delaunay structure to cluster inherits the shortcoming of DBSCAN algorithm, which cannot run in large high dimensional data sets etc. We proposed GKSCOC (Genetic K-Medoids Spatial Clustering with Obstacles Constraints) based on Genetic algorithms (GAs) and IKSCOC (Improved K-Medoids Spatial Clustering with Obstacles Constraints) in the literature [9]. The results of the experiments on real datasets show that it is better than IKSCOC. But the drawback of GKSCOC is a comparatively slower speed in clustering. 
Recently, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been applied to data clustering Constraints based on PSO and K-Medoids, called PKSCOC. The PKSCOC can not clustering. The results on real datasets show that the PKSCOC algorithm performs better than the IKSCOC algorithm in terms of quantization error. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. SCOC based on K-Medoids, called KSCOC, is discussed in Section 2. Section 3 introduces PSO. Section 4 presents SCOC based on PSO and K-Medoids, called PKSCOC. The performances of PKSCOC on datasets in comparison with the IKSCOC are showed in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes the paper. K-Means, K-Medoids and CLARANS. K-Means takes the average value of a cluster as the cluster centre. While adopting this algorithm, a cluster center possibly just falls cluster center cannot fall on the obstacle. In view of this, K-Medoids algorithm is adopted in this paper. CLARANS algorithm can be adopted to handle large number of data sets. 2.1 Motivating Concepts introduced. corresponding node in V , and two nodes 1 v and 2 v in V are joined by an edge in E if and only if the correspondi ng vertices they represent are visible to each other. To generate VG , we use VPIA (VGRAPH Point Incorporation Algorithm) as presented in [14]. Definition 2 (Obstructed distance). Given point p and point q , the obstructed points p and q without cutting through any obstacles. We can use Dijkstra Algorithm to compute obstructed distance. The simulation result is in Fig.3 and the red solid line represents the obstructed distance we got. 2.2 Improved SCOC Based on K-Medoids K-Medoids algorithm selects the most central object of a cluster as the cluster centre. adopted here, and its definition can be defined as: is the direct Euclidean distance between the two points p and q . 
To handle obstacles constraints, accordi ngly, criterion function for estimating the quality of spatial clustering with obstacles constraints can be revised as: off by any obstacle. As we know, the cost of computing obstruc ted distance is much more than direct Euclidean distance X  X , so computing o E is much more costly than computing E . In order to improve the efficiency of whole algorithm, the method of Improved KSCOC (IKSCOC) is adopted as follows [9]. 
While IKSCOC still inherits two shortcomings because it is based on standard cause different results of the spatial clusteri ng and even have no solution. The other is that it only gives attention to local constringency and is sensitive to an outlier. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based optimization method first proposed by Kennedy and Eberhart [15, 16]. In order to find an optimal or near-optimal solution to the problem, PSO updates the current generation of particles (each solution obtained by each particle and the entire population. In the context of PSO, a best position discovered by the particle so far and, the best position discovered by the There is one version of PSO called global PSO in which all the particles are considered to be neighbors of each other. A ll particles start with randomly initialized position for the th i particle are updated by using the following equations: where w is the inertia weight, corresponding particle. Velocity magnitudes are often clipped to a predetermined maximum value, max V .The PSO is usually executed with repeated application of Alternatively, the algorithm can be terminated when the velocity updates are close to zero over a number of iterations. 
PSO is effective in nonlinear optimization problems and it is easy to implement. In optimum under some initialization conditions [17]. In order to overcome the disadvantage of partitioning approach which only gives with Obstacles Constraints based on PSO and K-Medoids (PKSCOC). the PKSCOC algorithm in section 4.2. 4.1 PSO Clustering In the context of clustering, single particle represents the N c cluster centroid. That is, each particle x i is constructed as follows: where c1usterings for the current spatial data. population. Therefore, it needs to be designed so that an individual with a high fitness Here, objective function is defined as follows: 4.2 Spatial Clustering with Obstacles Constraints Based on PSO and Using the standard gbest PSO, Spatial Clustering with Obstacles Constraints based on PSO and K-Medoids (PKSCOC), which is similar to the K-means PSO hybrid as presented in [11],is adopted as follows. where max t is the maximum number of iteration,  X  is the minimum velocity. STEP 1 constringency speed of the global PSO. 
The population-based search of the PKSCOC algorithm reduces the effect that multiple positions in parallel. Section 5 shows that the PKSCOC algorithm performs better than the IKSCOC algorithm in terms of quantization error. experiments were run on a 2.4GHz PC with 512M memory. We have made experiments separately by K-Medoids, IKSCOC and PKSCOC. The number of particles 12 max max 50, 0.72, 2, 0.4, 100, 0.001. nw ccV t  X  == == = = =
Fig.4 shows the results on synthetic Dataset1. Fig.4 (a) shows the original data IKSCOC. Fig.4 (d) shows 4 clusters found by PKSCOC.

It is showed that optimum points by starting at different initial value while PKSCOC constringes nearly in the same optimum points each time. Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that PKSCOC has stronger global constringent ability comparing with IKSCOC; and PKSCOC has not only considered high local constringent speed but also kept good global constringent characteristic. Spatial clustering has been an active research area in the data mining community. novel PKSCOC based on PSO and K-Medoids. The comparison proves that our value and extensive application prospect.
