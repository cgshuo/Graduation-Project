 Interpreting news requires identifying its constituent events. Information extraction ( IE ) makes this feasi-ble by considering only events of a specified type, such as personnel succession or arrest (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996; LDC, 2005), an approach not extensible to novel events, or the same event types in sub-domains, e.g. sport. On the other hand, topic detection and tracking ( TDT ; Allan, 2002) disregards individual event mentions, clustering together arti-cles that share a topic.

Between these fine and coarse-grained ap-proaches, event identification requires grouping ref-erences to the same event. However, strict corefer-ence is hampered by the complexity of event seman-tics: poison , murder and die may indicate the same effective event. The solution is to tag mentions with a canonical identifier for each news-triggering event.
This paper introduces event linking : given a past event reference in context, find the article in a news archive that first reports that the event happened. The task has an immediate practical application: some online newspapers link past event mentions to relevant news stories, but currently do so with low coverage and consistency; an event linker can add referentially-precise hyperlinks to news.

The event linking task parallels entity link-ing ( NEL ; Ji and Grishman, 2011), considering a news archive as a knowledge base ( KB ) of events, where each article exclusively represents the zero or more events that it first reports. Coupled with an ap-propriate event extractor, event linking may be per-formed for all events mentioned in a document, like the named entity disambiguation task (Bunescu and Pa  X sca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007).

We have annotated and analysed 150 news and opinion articles, marking references to past, news-worthy events, and linking where possible to canon-ical articles in a 13-year news archive. Approaches to news event processing are subsumed within broader notions of topics, scenario templates, or temporal entities, among others. We illustrate key challenges in processing news events and motivate event linking through the example story in Figure 1. Salience Our story highlights carjackings and a police warning as newsworthy, alongside events like feeding , drove and told which carry less individual weight. Orthogonally, parts of the story are new events, while others are previously reported events that the reader may be aware of (illustrated in Fig-ure 1). Online, the two background carjackings and the police warning are hyperlinked to other SMH arti-cles where they were reported. Event schemas tend not to directly address salience: MUC -style IE (Gr-Figure 1: Possible event mentions marked in an ar-ticle from SMH , segmented into news (N) and back-ground (B) event portions. ishman and Sundheim, 1996) selects an event type of which all instances are salient; TDT (Allan, 2002) operates at the document level, which avoids differ-entiating event mentions; and TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) marks the main event in each sentence. Critiquing ACE05 event detection for not addressing salience, Ji et al. (2009) harness cross-document fre-quencies for event ranking. Similarly, reference to a previously-reported event implies it is newsworthy. Diversity IE traditionally targets a selected event type (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996). ACE05 con-siders a broader event typology, dividing eight thematic event types ( business , justice , etc.) into 33 subtypes such as attack , die and declare bankruptcy (LDC, 2005). Most subtypes suffer from few annotated instances, while others are impracti-cally broad: sexual abuse, gunfire and the Holocaust each constitute attack instances (is told considered an attack in Figure 1?). Inter-annotator agreement is low for most types. 1 While ACE05 would mark the various attack events in our story, police warned would be unrecognised. Despite template adapta-tion (Yangarber et al., 2000; Filatova et al., 2006; Li et al., 2010; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011), event types are brittle to particular tasks and domains, such as bio-text mining (e.g. Kim et al., 2009); they can-not reasonably handle novel events. Identity Event coreference is complicated by par-titive (sub-event) and logical (e.g. causation) re-lationships between events, in addition to lexical-semantic and syntactic issues. When consider-ing the relationship between another carjacking and grabbed , drove or stabbed , ACE05 would apply the policy:  X  X hen in doubt, do not mark any corefer-ence X  (LDC, 2005). Bejan and Harabagiu (2008) consider event coreference across documents, mark-ing the  X  X ost important events X  (Bejan, 2010), al-beit within Google News clusters, where multiple articles reporting the same event are likely to use similar language. Similar challenges apply to iden-tifying event causality and other relations: Bejan and Harabagiu (2008) suggest arcs such as feeding  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  tions of FrameNet X  X  frame relations (Fillmore et al., 2003). However, these too are semantically subtle. Explicit reference By considering events through topical document clusters, TDT avoids some chal-lenges of precise identity. It prescribes rules of in-terpretation for which stories pertain to a seminal event. However, the carjackings in our story are neither preconditions nor consequences of a semi-nal event and so would not constitute a TDT clus-ter. TDT fails to account for these explicit event ref-erences. Though Feng and Allan (2009) and Yang et al. (2009) consider event dependency as directed arcs between documents or paragraphs, they gener-ally retain a broad sense of topic with little attention to explicit reference. Given an explicit reference to a past event, event linking grounds it in a given news archive. This ap-plies to all events worthy of having been reported, and harnesses explicit reference rather than more general notions of relevance. Though analogous to NEL , our task differs in the types of expressions that may be linked, and the manner of determining the correct KB node to link to, if any. 3.1 Event-referring expressions We consider a subset of newsworthy events  X  things that happen and directly trigger news  X  as candidate referents. In TimeML  X  X  event classification (Puste-jovsky et al., 2003), newsworthy events would gen-erally be occurrence (e.g. die , build , sell ) or aspec-tual (e.g. begin , discontinue ), as opposed to percep-tion (e.g. hear ), intentional state (e.g. believe ), etc. Still, we are not confined to these types when other classes of event are newsworthy. All references must be explicit, reporting the event as factual and com-pleted or ongoing.

Not all event references meeting these criteria are reasonably LINKABLE to a single article: MULTIPLE many distinct events, or an event type, AGGREGATE emerges from other events over time, COMPLEX an event reported over multiple articles 3.2 A news archive as a KB We define a canonical link target for each event: the earliest article in the archive that reports the given event happened or is happening . Each archival arti-cle implicitly represents zero or more related events, just as Wikipedia entries represent zero or one entity in NEL . Links target the story as a whole: closely related, co-reported events link to the same article, avoiding a problematically strict approach to event identity. An archive reports only selected events, so a valid target may not exist ( NEL  X  X  NIL ). We link to a digital archive of the Sydney Morn-ing Herald: Australian and international news from 1986 to 2009, published daily, Monday to Saturday. 2 We annotate a randomly sampled corpus of 150 arti-cles from its 2009 News and Features and Business sections including news reports, op-eds and letters.
For this whole-document annotation, a single word of each past/ongoing, newsworthy event men-tion is marked. 3 If LINKABLE , the annotator searches the archive by keyword and date, selecting a target, reported here (a self-referential link) or NIL . An annotation of our example story (Figure 1) would produce five groups of event references (Table 1). Table 1: Event linking annotations for Figure 1 Table 2: Inter-annotator and adjudicator F 1 scores
All documents were annotated by external anno-tator A; external annotators B and C annotated 72 and 24 respectively; and all were adjudicated by the first author (J). Pairwise inter-annotator agreement in Table 2 shows that annotators infrequently select the same words to link, but that reasonable agree-ment on the link target can be achieved for agreed tokens. 4 Adjudicator-annotator agreements are gen-erally much higher than inter-annotator agreements: in many cases, an annotator fails to find a target or selects one that does not first report the event; J accepts most annotations as valid. In other cases, there may be multiple articles published on the same day that describe the event in question from differ-ent angles; agreement increases substantially when relaxed to accept date agreement. Our adjudicated corpus of 150 documents is summarised in Table 3.
Where a definitive link target is not available, an annotator may erroneously select another candidate: an opinion article describing the event, an article where the event is mentioned as background, or an article anticipating the event.

The task is complicated by changed perspective between an event X  X  first report and its later reference. Table 3: Annotation frequencies: no. of mentions, distinct per document, and document frequency Can overpayed link to what had been acquired ? Can 10 died be linked to an article where only nine are confirmed dead ? For the application of adding hy-perlinks to news, such a link might be beneficial, but it may be better considered an AGGREGATE .

The schema underspecifies definitions of  X  X vent X  and  X  X ewsworthiness X , accounting for much of the token-level disagreement, but not directly affecting the task of linking a specified mention to the archive. Adjectival mentions such as Apple X  X  new CEO are easy to miss and questionably explicit. Events are also confused with facts and abstract entities, such as bans, plans, reports and laws. Unlike many other facts, events can be grounded to a particular time of occurrence, often stated in text. To assess task feasibility, we present bag-of-words (
BoW ) and oracle results (Figure 2). Using the whole document as a query 5 retrieves 30% of gold targets at rank 10, but only 60% by rank 150. Term win-dows around each event mention perform close to our oracle consisting of successful search keywords collected during annotation, with over 80% recall at 150. No system recalls over 30% of targets at 1-best, suggesting a reranking approach may be required.
Constraining search result dates is essential; an-notators X  constraints improve recall by 20% at rank 50. These constraints may draw on temporal expres-sions in the source article or external knowledge. Successful automated linking will therefore require extensive use of semantic and temporal information.
Our corpus also highlights distinctions between explicit event reference and broader relationships. Yang et al. (2009) makes the reasonable assumption that news events generally build on others that re-cently precede them. We find that the likelihood a linked article occurred fewer than d days ago re-duces exponentially with respect to d , yet the rate of decay is surprisingly slow: half of all link targets precede their source by over 3 months.

The effect of coreporting rather than coreference is also clear: like { carjacking , grabbed } in our ex-ample, mention chains include { return , decide , re-contest }, { winner , Cup } as well as more familiar in-stances like { acquired , acquisition }. We have introduced event linking , which takes a novel approach to news event reference, associating each newsworthy past event with a canonical arti-cle in a news archive. We demonstrate task X  X  fea-sibility, with reasonable inter-annotator agreement over a 150 document corpus. The corpus highlights features of the retrieval task and its dependence on temporal knowledge. As well as using event link-ing to add referentially precise hyperlinks to a news archive, further characteristics of news will emerge by analysing the graph of event references.
