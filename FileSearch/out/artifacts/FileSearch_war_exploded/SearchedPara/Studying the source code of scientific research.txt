 Just as inspecting the source code of programs tells us a lot about the process of programming, inspecting the  X  X ource code X  of scientific papers informs on the process of scien-tific writing. We report on our study of the source of tens of thousands of papers from Computer Science and Mathe-matics. In understanding software artifacts, the source code is the primary subject of study. The open source movement em-phasizes the availability of source code as a mechanism to al-low extensibility and maintenance of software projects. Even within  X  X losed source X  development, source code is typically accessible and readable to most users within version con-trol systems. The study of source code helps to understand design decisions, and explains the detailed logic behind the final software object.
 Meanwhile, in the world of research, the unit of production X  the research paper X  X s typically presented in  X  X ompiled X  form, say as a PDF file. However, this is also created from some underlying source code: a document that is processed to produce the PDF output. In contrast to the software set-ting, the source code here is typically guarded closely, and not even shared with close colleagues outside of the core au-thorship team. This practice is unfortunate, since the study of the source code of research papers has the potential to provide great insight into the process of communicating re-search work, and the differing norms and traits across fields. The source code of a research paper can include many fea-tures that are either not present or hard to extract from the final object. For example, this can include multiple earlier versions of the text, internal comments and notes, and sec-tions of text which are absent from the final version. It can also include descriptions of how to create complex format-ting (e.g. tables) in a way that is easier to parse; internal labels for sections and references that are replaced by nu-meric references or hyperlinks in the final version, and so on. Such features can cast more light on the internal thought process that goes into producing the final paper, and allow automatic extraction of trends and patterns. In this article, we describe some of the observations we have been able to make in this direction, thanks to access to a large trove of research source code.
 the second choice tool in these areas is the Microsoft Word word-processor.
 A secondary feature of how L A T E X is used is whether the input is structured into multiple files. Strikingly, 66% of Mathematics papers have a single .tex source file, indicating that the paper is fully self-contained: it does not call on any external figures or bibliographic files. In contrast, 82% of Computer Science submissions are formed of multiple source files.
 Vocabulary choice. Given the source data, it is straight-forward to extract all the words used in the corpus of sci-entific papers. We can then compare the relative frequency of different terms between such corpora. Comparing Com-puter Science and Mathematics, we can measure the occur-rence frequency of words in each, and identify those that have the sharpest difference in usage. Perhaps most telling is the term that is used most differently in each: in Com-puter Science, the word that is used most in comparison to Mathematics is  X  X lgorithm X , while in the other direction it is  X  X quation X . Arguably, this cuts to the heart of the differ-ence in focus between the two fields.
 The top-ten words that are used most often in Computer Science compared to Mathematics are while in the reverse direction, we obtain While these terms should be intelligible to researchers in ei-ther field, it is clear that notions such as  X  X ata X  and  X  X nfor-mation X , techniques such as  X  X robability X  and  X  X lgorithm X  and concerns such as  X  X ime X  are central to Computer Sci-ence. Meanwhile, the words that distinguish mathemati-cal writing are primarily for common symbols:  X  X lpha X ,  X  X ambda X ,  X  X amma X ,  X  X mega X ,  X  X nfty X ; or for formatting in L A T E X, like  X  X rac X  and  X  X athbb X .
 Signs and symbols. L A T E X makes it easy to express math-ematical symbols. It is instructive to study their relative oc-currence. For example, we noted that the symbol for  X  X ess than or equal to X  (  X  ) is dramatically more common than  X  X reater than or equal to X  (  X  ): there are 85% more occur-rences of  X  . We suggest that this is indicative of a common expressive trope to bound a quantity of interest, and then provide subsequent upper bounds on this quantity that are progressively simpler to state. Comparing the number of open parentheses to the number of close parentheses, we observed that 0.7% of open parentheses are not closed. If anything, this is lower than we might expect.
 Summertime, and the living is easy? The arXiv also provides metadata, such as the date of upload of a paper. The pattern of uploads is non-uniform throughout the year, with a pronounced drop during July and August, as illus-trated in Figure 1). The number of papers uploaded in Au-gust is 16% below the average amount. These two months are when the majority of research universities in the north-ern hemisphere have their summer vacations. This seems at odds with the oft-repeated complaint of academics that they can X  X  wait for the summer in order to get more research In other cases however, it seems that profanity is used inter-nally to reflect the author X  X  true feelings: there are examples where a particularly difficult example is given the (internal) label  X  X astard X ; a macro for a complexity class is given the handle  X  X rap X ; and an initial theorem is labeled  X  X ullshit X  with an improvement provided. One particular notable ex-ample is of the occurrence of  X  X ollocks X  (a British-English idiom with broadly negative connotation) which occurs over fifty times within a single paper. Closer inspection reveals that this is because the central theorem in the paper is given the label  X  X ogs-bollocks X  and referred to extensively throughout; this phrase is a (coarse) British-English idiom with a strongly positive connotation. There are examples of profanity used in comments: the observation that  X  X he \ thanks layout looks crappy! X ; the single word  X  X ullshit X  prefacing some technical text which has been commented out; and the comment  X  X ho the fuck is  X ? X  immediately after an acknowledgment to the named individual.
 Size isn X  X  everything. We also analyze the size of papers picture is worth a thousand words X , suggests that adding illustrative figures should tend to reduce the length of a document. However, we observe the opposite trend from Figure 3(b): in both Math and CS, adding figures increases the length of a paper. In Math, the trend seems to be fairly consistent, and we have a new adage:  X  X  pictures costs three hundred words X . For CS, the trend is more variable, and weaker: the cost is an average of 120 words per figure. We might conjecture that in Math, figures are typically used to illustrate technical concepts which require some effort to describe, whereas in CS, many figures are data plots that need less text to interpret.
 Performing the same calculation with the use of theorems to encapsulate central results, both CS and Math show a sim-ilar trend, which is very consistent: each theorem lengthens the paper by around 600 words. This makes sense: the statement, discussion and proof of a theorem should require some reasonable amount of additional text. Use of theorems is more characteristic of Math: at least 71% of Math papers contain a theorem, while only 48% of CS papers contain theorems. However, for papers with theorems, the distribu-tion is not so different: CS papers have 4.85 theorems on average, while Math papers have 5.51. From these observations, we have demonstrated that there are many trends, patterns and behaviors in the writing of research papers that can be found by study of their  X  X ource code X . In the description of our full study, we provide more examples, and motivate the development of the area of  X  X ci-enceography X , as the study of scientific writing [3]. This complements the much more substantial body of work that analyzes other facets of the scientific corpus, such as biblio-metrics and scientometrics, which focus on citation patterns across papers [1; 2; 4]. While there has been detailed study of scientific writing in the past, such as considering the dif-ferent forms of argument and persuasion used, these have tended to study on a single paper at a time [5; 6]. The hope is that the study of larger data sets can have an effect akin to the impact of online social network data on social network analysis.
 Many future directions are possible. The natural direction is to expand the scope of this study, in terms both of the subject areas studied and types of data used in the analy-sis. In addition to L A T E X documents, there is relevant in-formation with other formats of document (principally the Microsoft Word formats), and from other sources: say, mul-tiple versions of a paper from a version control system; or in the (source code for) slides for a conference presentation or poster. Here, the first challenge is to identify suitable sources which can provide sufficient quantity of data to pro-vide statistically meaningful insights.
