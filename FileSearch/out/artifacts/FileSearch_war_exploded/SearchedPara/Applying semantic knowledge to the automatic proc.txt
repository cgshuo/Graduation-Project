 1. Introduction is the automatic anchoring and ordering of its events in time. This task can be divided into three steps: (i) recognizing exes in order to anchor and order the events in time.

For example (1) contains a timex ( October 1999 ) and an event ( went ); the normalized value for October 1999 is 1999 X  1910; and there is a temporal relation  X  the time of the event went is included in the 1999 X 1910 time-span.

Temporal information processing has various applications. These include, but are not limited to, the following. In question answering, temporal reasoning is required to allow complex questions to be answered, such as  X  X  Who was the president of US 2007 ) and in real applications (e.g., Google Timeline).

When applying temporal information processing to other tasks the performance of the computational approaches must whole process is negatively affected. The computational approaches to this subtask are currently based principally on mor-phosyntactic knowledge. These approaches have difficulty in coping with semantic ambiguity and generalization. Our hypothesis is that approaches using semantic knowledge will be (i) capable of solving the morphosyntactic ambiguity of some timexes and events; (ii) more general than those based solely on morphosyntax owing to the higher abstraction level of semantics as compared to morphosyntax; and (iii) useful for multiple languages.

The aim of this paper is to apply semantic knowledge as additional information in order to improve the efficacy of cur-rent temporal information processing techniques. We therefore present a data-driven approach: TIPSem (Temporal Informa-tion Processing using Semantics). This is based on semantic knowledge (semantic networks and semantic roles) plus morphosyntactic knowledge. In order to measure the influence of semantics in a precise manner, our approach and a base-line (TIPSem-B), which is based only on morphosyntactic knowledge, are evaluated and compared. Furthermore, in order to test the validity of the hypothesis in different languages, the approaches are developed and evaluated for English and Spanish.
 This paper completes two previous works in this line of research: (i) our earlier version of TIPSem evaluated in
TempEval-2 ( Llorens, Saquete, &amp; Navarro-Colorado, 2010b ) and (ii) our initial data-driven implementation for English event processing ( Llorens, Saquete, &amp; Navarro-Colorado, 2010a ). With regard to (i), this paper presents a new version which tackles timexes and events separately. This permits the semantics of each entity to be captured better, and in fact, improves upon the performance obtained in TempEval-2. With regard to (ii), we present an improved event processing approach which we evaluate over the new TempEval-2 dataset. TempEval-2 represents a fair benchmark for the compar-ison of different approaches. Moreover, we analyze lexical semantics and semantic roles independently, and from a multilingual perspective.

The following section includes the background to and the motivation for the use of semantics. Section 3 provides a de-tailed description of our proposal. Section 4 includes its evaluation and a comparative analysis of the results for English and Spanish. Finally, in Section 5 , we draw conclusions and make suggestions for further studies. 2. Background and motivation (iii) a discussion concerning our motivation for using specific semantic knowledge which differentiates our approach from those reviewed in the related work. 2.1. Temporal information annotation in natural language
The aim of studying temporal information in natural language has led the scientific community to define different tem-poral entities such as timexes and events.

Several efforts have been made to define standard ways in which to annotate the temporal information in texts. The main objective of annotation is to make temporal information explicit through standard schemes. Since temporal information extraction was first included in the context of Message Understanding Conference (MUC) ( Grishman &amp; Sundheim, 1996 ), there have been three important annotation schemes: TIDES, STAG, and TimeML.
 2000 ) emerged in order to annotate only temporal expressions and their normalized values in text. TimeML ( Pustejovsky et al., 2003a ) combined and extended features of both the aforementioned schemes.
This paper is focused on the TimeML 1 annotation scheme because it has been adopted as a standard by a large number of researchers owing to its completeness and the comprehensive improvements it makes on the previous schemes. Furthermore, tence annotated with TimeML temporal expressions ( TIMEX3 (2) John &lt; EVENT class="OCCURRENCE" &gt; came &lt; /EVENT 2.2. Related Work
Several computational approaches address the automatic recognition and classification of temporal expressions and events. In order to summarize the sate-of-the-art, we analyze the current temporal information processing systems as re-to provide a broader comparison, we analyze the performance results that these approaches obtained in the last interna-tional evaluation (see Table 2 ).

In Table 2 , we detail the results obtained by the best approaches in the TempEval-2 evaluation exercise ( Verhagen et al., 2010 ) in order to compare their efficacy.
 As is shown in Table 2 , the best scores for timex recognition were obtained by the HeidelTime system, closely followed by TIPSem and TRIOS. For event processing, the best scores were obtained by TIPSem, followed by the Edinburgh-LTG system.
With regard to the strategies used, many of the systems are rule-based, particularly those which only address timex pro-cessing. Rule-based and data-driven approaches obtained a very close performance in timex processing, while data-driven and hybrid systems were more popular among those approaches that tackled event processing, and show better results than rule-based systems in this task.

In particular, among the data-driven and hybrid approaches, the most popular machine learning techniques are: (i) support vectormachines(SVM)whichareusedbyMarchetal.andSTEPand(ii)conditionalrandomfields(CRF)whichareusedbyTRIOS andTIPSem.SVMs( Cortes&amp;Vapnik,1995 )arewidelyknownclassifierswhichhavebeensuccessfullyappliedtovariousnatural sequence labeling problems. This makes it useful for recognizing timexes and events, because they appear in word sequences.
Regardingthelinguisticknowledgeused,mostsystemsarebasedonmorphosyntax.Someofthemincludelexicalsemantics and only two of them apply compositional semantics (TRIOS and TIPSem). The results obtained by those systems that use only morphosyntax are reasonably high for timex processing (HeidelTime), while their performance is lower for event processing.
Finally, with regard to the target language, the approaches reviewed were only developed for English, with the exception of our approach (TIPSem) which tackles English and Spanish. For Spanish, TIPSem obtained the best results for timex and event processing. Only one other system participated in TempEval-2 for Spanish, UC3M ( Vicente-D X ez, Moreno-Schneider, &amp; Mart X nez, 2010 ). UC3M is a rule-based system which uses morphosyntactic knowledge. It addresses timex processing, but not event processing. Our approach is therefore the most complete approach that is currently available for Spanish. 2.3. Motivation for applying semantic knowledge
As described previously, our proposal is focused on the use of semantic knowledge. The following subsections report on each type of semantic knowledge applied to timex and event processing. We first describe the application of lexical seman-tics and, we then explain the application of semantic roles, which are our main focus. 2.3.1. Lexical semantics
As previously mentioned, many of the approaches that tackle the proposed tasks are based on morphosyntactic knowl-edge. Furthermore, they achieved a high performance when using morphosyntax, particularly in the timex processing task.
We attribute the high performance obtained to the inclusion of word-triggers. These predefined lists of keywords that are likely to appear within timexes or events have proven to be useful for recognition.

From our point of view, the application of word-triggers could be considered a naive form of domain-oriented lexical semantics. However, the application of general lexical semantic resources such as semantic networks has two advantages (as a char sequence) in a specific domain (e.g., time/eventuality) but the semantics of the word (as a specific concept or sense) within a general domain, encoded in a lexicon with a semantic network structure. Secondly, general semantic net-works tend to be standard and complete, and they are maintained and improved by third parties independently of our sys-tem. Their use increases the modularity of the approaches and avoids the costly task of developing a complete trigger-list.
WordNet and EuroWordNet ( Vossen, 1998 ) are the most popular semantic networks for English and European languages respectively. Semantic networks have been widely used in the temporal expression identification task. Negri and Marseglia hyponyms of the calendar _ day synset. In Saquete, Mart X   X  onyms of timex words from WordNet and also from the Latent Words Language Model, which predicts synonyms in context state hyponyms. 2.3.2. Semantic roles
Semantic roles capture the meaning of a sentence as regards how their arguments are related. A semantic role is the semantic relationship held between a syntactic constituent and a predicate. For each predicate, all the constituents are ing the predicate (to write), AM-TMP refers to the temporal adjunct ( when it took place), is the patient argument (thing written), AM-MNR is the manner adjunct ( how was it done), and ( where ). In (3d), AM-CAU represents the causative adjunct ( why ). (3) a. [In July 1277 AM TMP ], [John A 0 ] wrote [a letter
With regard to the relationship between semantic roles and temporal entities, in general lines, it will be noted that main verbs representing events and temporal expressions tend to be contained by temporal adjuncts. Furthermore, the verb  X  X  X o to appear under specific adjuncts (3d), or to play the A1 role of certain verbs (3c).

The first modern proposals concerning semantic roles were enumerated by Fillmore (1968), Fillmore (1971) . These pro-agent and proto-patient.

In NLP, the most widely used semantic role sets are the set developed in the FrameNet (FN) project ( Baker, Fillmore, only covers most general English verbs and nouns.
 cerning the application of semantic roles have demonstrated that this information is very useful for different NLP purposes timex and event processing, they are only used by one other system apart from ours: the TRIOS system. TRIOS uses a logical form representation of semantic roles based on a variation of FrameNet. The variation reduces the FrameNet roleset to approximately 2500 semantic types and 30 semantic roles.

In this paper, we cover the following issues not tackled in the state-of-the-art. The few approaches that include semantics ence of semantics on performance has not, therefore, been analyzed in depth. We analyze the PropBank role set which has never been used for temporal information processing. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of combining lexical semantics and semantic roles. 3. Our proposal: TIPSem
We tackle the automatic recognition and classification of timexes and events in natural language. This is done by follow-ing the TimeML annotation scheme and involves bounding them in the text using XML tags and assigning each one a class from the TimeML taxonomy. Example (4) illustrates a raw text input and the expected output after the processing described. (4) Input : John came on Monday. After, he left US. Then, he told us he was born in 1980.

The objectives of our proposal are: (i) the application of lexical semantics and semantic roles in addition to morphosyntax gual study of the proposal, for English and Spanish, in order to ascertain its degree of language independence.
Prior to developing the approach, we considered two possible strategies for the application of semantics: rule-based and data-driven. The rule-based strategy can be applied to timex recognition owing to the relationship that timexes have with
However, the relatedness of semantics with events is more complex, particularly with regard to semantic roles. The manual construction of high coverage rules is costly and is limited to our prior knowledge of the task addressed.
The data-driven strategy is becoming common among related works since corpora are available (e.g., TempEval-2 data-set). This strategy prevents us from coding rules based on our prior knowledge, which may be incomplete or inconsistent with the real examples  X  especially when the task is complex, as in the case of event processing.
Given this analysis, we chose to develop TIPSem as a data-driven approach. We then analyzed two possible ways in which architecture: first, bound the element (e.g., timex) and second classify it (e.g., duration). The latter merges recognition Sem has therefore been developed as a classify-after-recognition approach.

In the proposal, first, given annotated examples in one of the languages, four models are trained: timex recognition, timex classification, event recognition and event classification. Once the models have been generated, the system uses them to annotate any input raw text. We trained two approaches, TIPSem (semantics + morphosyntax) and TIPSem-B (morphosyn-tax). The difference in the correctness of their outputs will reflect the contribution of semantics.
The external tools and resources used to obtain the morphosyntactic and semantic features for each language are the fol-lowing. For English, the morphological features are obtained from TreeTagger ( Schmid, 1994 ), lexical semantics from Word-Net ( Fellbaum, 1998 ), and syntactic and semantic roles (PropBank) features from the CCG SRL tool ( Punyakanok, Roth, Yih, the exception of lexical semantics, which are extracted from EuroWordNet ( Vossen, 1998 ). 3.1. Learning models for the recognition and classification of temporal expressions (Timexes)
We tackled timex recognition and timex classification separately as two sequential steps. 3.1.1. Timex recognition
A timex is a linguistic representation of a time point or period. It is normally denoted by a noun, adjective, adverb, or a noun phrase, adjective phrase, or adverb phrase. The timexes shown in example (5) are underlined. (5) a. John came on Monday and he will leave on October 9th, 2012 .
Recognition implies the bounding of TimeML time expressions in the text. This problem can be viewed as a sequence labeling problem. Given an input text (token sequence), each token must be labeled with an IOB2 value (label sequence) recognition task. (6) input text solution The aforementioned problem is tackled with the following morphosyntactic features .

Morphological : The lemma and PoS context, in a 5-window ( 2,+2), is employed. This proved to have a better perfor-mance than considering only the information of each token individually (without context), or a smaller (3-window) or larger context (7-window).

The lemma is crucial for the recognition of time expressions, such as that in (7). (7) The conference ended [ yesterday TIMEX 3 ].
As is shown in the example, some lemmas, such as  X  X  X esterday X  X , are very likely to represent timexes (8) shows a temporal expression which may be ambiguous at a lexical level,  X  X  X ay (8) May you find what you are looking for.

Here, the information concerning the word class (PoS) solves the ambiguity owing to the fact that the first  X  X  X ay X  X  is a modal verb while the second is a proper noun (a month).

The context window is also very important for the recognition of multi-token expressions, because some tokens only rep-resent a temporal expression if their neighboring tokens hold specific lemmas and PoS  X  see example (9). (9) This is the chief of the company.
 ordinal and its right neighboring word is a proper noun with a specific lemma (a month), but not if its left neighboring
In example (10), we can see how a number is more likely to be part of a temporal expression if it is preceded by a prep-osition and not followed by a noun. (10) He owns 1999 properties.

Although morphological information is very useful, it is not always sufficient to allow temporal expressions to be distin-guished from the rest of the text.
 (11) a. (S (NP She) (VP stayed (PP during (NP [the second half of the year
Furthermore, if an NP is governed by a PP, the heading prepositions may be useful to increase the probability of the NP containing a timex, and it is therefore also included as a feature. In the example (11), the PP headed by  X  X  X uring X  X  intro-duces a timex in the NP it governs (11a), while the PP headed by  X  X  X ehind X  X  does not (11b). However, examples (12a) and (12b) show the same syntactic structure, but only (12a) represents a timex. (12) a. (S (NP She) (VP won (PP in (NP April))). ( timex )
This motivates the use of higher level linguistic information like semantics. Lexical semantics indicate that the concept  X  X  X pril X  X  is related to time and semantic roles show that  X  X  X n April X  X  plays a temporal role.
 The semantic features used to enhance the timex recognition model are:
Lexical Semantics : The top ontology classes of WordNet have been widely used to represent word meaning at the onto-logical level. Most of the nouns contained in timexes are hyponyms of time , time _ period or time _ unit . These concepts are distributed between the third and the forth level from the top concept, entity . Our approach therefore considers the top four hypernyms ( top 4 hypers ) of the most common sense for every noun and verb as a feature, excluding the top con-cept  X  see example (13). (13) The top 4 hypers for  X  X  X ecades X  X  is: representing timexes for tokens that obtain such values, even if their lemmas do not appear in training, which favors gen-eralization.

Semantic roles : Semantic roles provide the structural semantic relations of the predicates in which TimeML elements might participate. The temporal semantic role ( AM-TMP ) represents the temporal adjunct and often contains a time will increase the probability of all the tokens belonging to the AM-TMP role being timexes, regardless their lemmas. Fur-thermore, the combination role + lemma is included as a feature. This will specifically increase the probability of being able to represent a timex of the combinations of timex-related lemmas (e.g., April, week, etc.) with an AM-TMP role.
Semantic roles are also useful for tackling morphosyntactic ambiguity  X  X ee example (14). (14) [April A 0 ] likes apples. (female proper name) week X  X  do not necessarily represent temporal expressions, as is shown in the example. The semantic role labeling provide valuable information by marking them in a non-temporal semantic role (i.e., A0). In short, the approach must learn from the annotated examples which semantic roles are more likely to contain temporal expressions.

Fig. 2 illustrates the feature-vector described. 3.1.2. Timex classification According to TimeML scheme, timexes can be classified in four classes: Date . Expressions with date granularities (e.g.,  X  X  X onday X  X ).
 Duration . Periods of time (e.g.,  X  X  X wo weeks X  X ).
 Time . Expressions with time granularities (e.g.,  X  X 8 p.m. X  X ).
 Set . Recurring patterns in time (e.g.,  X  X  X onthly X  X ).

Classification involves the selection of one type for each recognized timex  X  see example (15). (15) TIMEX solution manner. For timexes spanning one token (e.g., yesterday), the features remain the same. For timexes spanning more than one just one value (e.g., role (two years) = AM-TMP). 3.2. Learning models for the recognition and classification of events
Event recognition and classification tasks are defined in the same way as the timex tasks. 3.2.1. Event recognition underlined in example (16). (16) a. John came on Monday.
We address event recognition as illustrated in example (17). (17) input text solution This problem is tackled by defining the following morphosyntactic features .

Morphological : The lemma and PoS context, in a 5-window ( 2,+2), is again employed. Events are generally expressed
Given this definition, PoS may assist in the recognition of verbs, and specific lemmas may identify certain nouns that rep-resent events such as  X  X  X ar X  X  or  X  X  X onference X  X . However, the performance in detecting unseen nominal events may be weaker. Example (18) illustrates some cases. (18) He went to the house.
 and the PoS, does not therefore make it possible to decide whether or not  X  X  X eeting X  X  should be an event.
Syntactic : The syntactic structure aids in the recognition of events. Example (19) shows sentences which may benefit from the consideration of syntactic information. (19) a. (S (NP America) (VP [has EVENT ] (NP the tanks)))). In (19),  X  X  X as X  X  is either an event or simply an auxiliary verb depending on the VP hierarchy.
 The semantic features used are:
Lexical Semantics : Most verbs in a text denote events. However, only some nouns denote events in particular semantic settings. Semantic networks provide useful information with which to recognize nominal events. Many nominal events are hyponyms of event , act or state . These concepts are distributed between the fourth and the fifth level from the top concept ( entity ) in the WordNet hyponym hierarchy. Our approach therefore considers the top four hypernyms  X  exclud-ing the top hypernym entity  X  for the most common sense for every word as a feature  X  see example (20). (20)  X  X  X itter led his team in a 10-h tour  X  X .
 of representing events for tokens that obtain these values, even if their lemmas do not appear in training.
Semantic roles : The relation between semantic roles and events is two fold: (i) many events are denoted by main verbs which will have arguments that play different roles and (ii) events also appear under specific roles for particular verbs. We therefore consider that semantic roles can be used to recognize and classify events.

We used four role-based features in our approach:  X  role represents the semantic role each token plays in a predicate. Apart from the main verbs (those that govern argu-(21) a. [The tax rates A 1 ] were [lower A 2 ]. ments (A0, AM-MOD, A4) contain an event.

This shows that events normally appear as main verbs, when they are verbal, and under the influence of certain roles when role does not guarantee that an event will be found, and the fact of finding an A0, AM-MOD or A4 does not mean that it is impossible to find an event. However, the probability of finding an event within A1 or A2 is higher.  X  role + word is the combination of the token and the semantic role it plays: (22) a. [He A 0 ] made [an offer A 1 ]. states. This feature merges the word and the role it plays to capture this information.  X  role + verb is the combination of the semantic role and the governing verb of the predicate. This distinguishes roles (23) a. [The tax rates A 1 ] were [lower A 2 ]. role of  X  X  X o eat X  X  which represents the thing eaten.  X  role + top 4 hypers is the combination of the role and the top4hypers feature of the token. This feature generalizes the
Fig. 3 illustrates the features described. 3.2.2. Event classification According to TimeML scheme, there are seven classes of events: Reporting . Action of declaring or narrating an event (e.g.,  X  X  X ay X  X ,  X  X  X eport X  X ).
 Perception . Physical perception of another event (e.g.,  X  X  X aid X  X ,  X  X  X ear X  X ).
 Aspectual . Aspectual predication of another event (e.g.,  X  X  X tart X  X ,  X  X  X ontinue X  X ).
 I _ Action . Intentional action (e.g.,  X  X  X ry X  X , X  X  X ttempt X  X ).
 I _ State . Intentional state (e.g.,  X  X  X eel X  X ,  X  X  X ope X  X ).
 State . Circumstance in which something holds the truth (e.g.,  X  X  X ainy X  X ,  X  X  X ad X  X ).
 Occurrence . Events that describe things that happen (e.g.,  X  X  X ame X  X ,  X  X  X onference X  X ).

Event classification, as illustrated in (24), consists of assigning a TimeML event-class to each event. The same strategy tures for event classification. (24) event solution 3.3. Machine learning techniques
As described previously, TIPSem implements a two-step architecture. It performs first the recognition and then the clas-sification of timexes and events.

On the one hand, the recognition step is defined as a sequence labeling problem. Of the techniques that are available, our cient supervised learning technique for sequence labeling and is thus appropriate for our purpose. Not only the word se-quence, but also the morphological, syntactic and semantic structure, which are present in the previously described features of our approach, benefit from the use of this learning technique. CRF has also been used to learn timex processing Kolya, Ekbal, &amp; Bandyopadhyay, 2010 ).

In the tasks tackled in this paper, we assume that X is a random variable over the data sequences to be labeled, and Y is a random variable over the corresponding label sequences, where all Y components ( Y possible IOB2 labels. The random variables X and Y are jointly distributed, and CRFs construct a conditional model from paired observation and label sequences: p ( Y j X ). The CRF++ toolkit was carried out using the parameters: CRF-L2 algorithm and hyper-parameter C =1.

On the other hand, the classification step is defined as the classification of those elements which have already been rec-techniques most widely used in the related works (see Section 2.2 ).

SVMs are defined as binary classifiers. Training examples of each class are represented graphically by points in space and an SVM constructs a hyperplane in an n-dimensional space, which separates the points pertaining to one category from the others with the largest margin. The problems tackled in this paper are multi-class classification problems. SVMs may be ex-tended to these problems, thus reducing the multi-class problem to multiple binary classification problems, which predict whether or not an example pertains to a single class. In particular, TIPSem uses the one-vs-one SVM classifier included in YamCha 7 (parameters: C = 1 and polynomial_degree = 1).

The parameter configurations described were selected because they obtained the best results in a previous comparative experiment. 4. Multilingual evaluation and discussion
The objective of this evaluation is to measure and analyze the effect of applying semantic knowledge to TimeML timex and event processing. We shall therefore evaluate the proposal described in this paper, a data-driven approach based on semantic features plus morphosyntactic features (TIPSem), and compare it with a baseline based on morphosyntactic fea-tures only (TIPSem-B). Since two types of semantic knowledge are used, we shall study the contribution of each kind of semantics by including two intermediate approaches using only one type, TIPSem-LS (lexical semantics) and TIPSem-SR (semantic roles).

In order to provide a multilingual perspective of the problem tackled in this paper, the approaches presented are evalu-ated for English and Spanish. In our research we are specifically interested in analyzing whether the inclusion of semantic knowledge in the feature set of the learning framework improves our approach in a similar way for different languages. 4.1. Evaluation framework
In this section, we describe the corpora and the evaluation criterion used to measure the performance of the approaches presented. 4.1.1. Corpora for English and Spanish
The approaches presented have been trained and tested using TempEval-2 datasets for English and Spanish. These are our main focus because they enable our results to be compared with those obtained in this recent evaluation exercise.
English Corpus : We used the TempEval-2 data for English, which supposes a revision of the previous TimeML gold stan-dard: TimeBank ( Pustejovsky et al., 2003b ). The data text originates from a variety of news articles from the Automatic
Content Extraction program (ACE) and PropBank texts (TreeBank2). Articles from the former are transcribed broadcast news and those supplied by PropBank are from the Wall Street Journal. Table 3 shows a summary of the statistics of the TempEval-2 data for English.

Spanish Corpus : We used the TempEval-2 data for Spanish, which originates from AnCora corpus ( Saur X , Saquete, &amp; Pust-ejovsky, 2009 ). It consists of 500 K words mainly taken from newspaper texts. This corpus is annotated and manually reviewed at: morphological level, and syntactic level, and semantic level ( Navarro, Civit, Mart X , Marcos, &amp; Fern X ndez, 2003 ). Table 4 shows a summary of the dataset statistics. 4.1.2. Criterion and measures
We applied the criterion used in TempEval-2 (SemEval-2010). The recognition was evaluated using the following metrics: number of tokens that are part of an extent in the key but not in the approach output.

Since the class _ score depends on the amount of instances which are correctly recognized, two systems recognizing a dif-score , which makes this comparison easier. 4.2. Results
The results of timex and event processing are presented separately. Moreover, they have been analyzed by considering the peculiarities of the recognition and the classification task. The best F in bold type to simplify their interpretation. 4.2.1. Results for temporal expressions (timexes)
Table 5 shows the results obtained in timex processing for English and Spanish. of semantic knowledge obtained the greatest error reduction (59%), which indicates that their contribution is complementary.

For Spanish, the error reduction was 33%. The contribution of both types of semantic knowledge was also complementary and then the combination obtained the highest results.
 reduction is statistically significant with a confidence of 95% for both languages.
For English, and with regard to lexical semantics, the presence of time-related semantic classes ( top 4 hypers feature) in timexes contributed to their correct recognition. Example (25) shows a timex that was missed by the baseline but recognized by the TIPSem-LS approach. (25) TempEval-2 test set  X  file: VOA19980501.1800.0355  X  sentence: 1
The baseline missed the timex  X  X  X onday X  X  because its 5-window context is not common in the training data. The proba-therefore, the probability of it being a timex increases.

Although, the application of lexical semantics has been mostly positive for the task in some cases it decreased the per-formance. For example (26). (26) TempEval-2 test set  X  file: WSJ900813-0157  X  sentence: 2  X  X  X his Week X  X  was not recognized as a timex by the baseline because  X  X  X eek X  X  followed by a double-quote is not found as a recognition of ambiguous cases.

The contribution of semantic roles is clearly focused on the temporal role. In the sentence analyzed above (26), semantic
Semantic roles also helped in (27). The number  X  X 1360 X  X  was marked as a timex by the baseline and the problem was solved by using semantic roles. (27) TempEval-2 test set  X  file: wsj _ 0505  X  sentence: 6
The non-semantic role approaches failed because it is highly probable that the sequence  X  X  X rom + number  X  X  represents a there is nothing related to time.

Another advantage of semantic roles is that they bound the temporal arguments for a predicate. This is useful in the detection multi-token temporal expressions. The timex in (28) was incorrectly bounded by the baseline and TIPSem-LS, and only  X  X  X he week X  X  was recognized. However, it was correctly bounded by the approaches including semantic roles because  X  X  X he end of this week X  X  was signaled by the AM-TMP role. (28) TempEval-2 test set  X  file: wsj _ 0073  X  sentence: 0
In some cases, such as that of (29), the application of semantic roles reduced the performance. (29) TempEval-2 test set  X  file: APW19980306.1001  X  sentence: 13
In (29),  X  X  X eb. 23 (accord) X  X  does not hold the temporal role and TIPSem thus failed to recognize it as a timex. Timexes as does not hold any temporal meaning and considering it as a timex would lead to a wrong temporal interpretation. The rec-ognition of a noun-modifier timex depends on the noun modified, for instance,  X  X  X ccords X  X  are likely to be modified by real timexes but  X  X  X treets X  X  are not.

Assuming that every annotated corpus may contain errors, we also found some false positives caused by human annota- X  X  X ach July X  X ,  X  X 20th century X  X ,  X  X  X wo decades X  X .

For Spanish, the analysis leads to the same conclusions. Semantic knowledge aided in the recognition of real timexes missed by the baseline, as is the case of (30a). Furthermore, semantic roles improved the bounding of long timexes, as in (30b). (30) TempEval-2 test set  X  file: 108 _ 20000601 _ d.txt  X  sentence: 3
For both languages, the contribution of semantics can be summarized in two ideas. Both lexical semantics and semantic roles are an advantage for the approaches X  generalization capabilities. The application of lexical semantics increases the probability of being able to represent a timex for all the concepts that are semantically related to time (even if they do not appear in the training). By using semantic roles, the approach increases the probability to represent a timex for all recall is very difficult if we consider that even the agreement between human annotators in the dataset is 83%. 0.99 (0.80) to 0.94 (0.84). This could be interpreted as an improvement, because TIPSem classified more timexes correctly. However, this could also mean that only the new expressions recognized by using semantics are also classified correctly.
Since we had no evidence as to whether they would also be correctly classified by the baseline, in order to compare the approaches on classification when isolated from the recognition, the following experiment was carried out: the baseline and TIPSem classifiers were evaluated over the same set of timexes (i.e., those correctly recognized by TIPSem).
For English, the results obtained were the same for the baseline and the TIPSem classifiers. This signifies that the appli-cation of semantics in timex classification had no effect.
 For Spanish, the same experiment was carried out and it was verified that semantic information was not discriminative. year) that share the top four hypernyms, and with regard to semantic roles, both timex classes may appear under a temporal argument (e.g., [this year AM TMP ], [for 15 years AM TMP
Most errors appeared as a result of the wrong classification of poorly represented classes. Time s represent 1% of timexes, with by extending the available corpora with documents containing more instances of time and set timexes. As regards that is capable of distinguishing, for example, dates (e.g., Monday) from times (e.g., morning). We used a general resource (WordNet), in which Monday and morning are hyponyms of period (i.e., equivalent). This can be improved using a resource distinguishing different granularities, i.e., finding one more detailed than WordNet. 4.2.2. Results for events
Table 6 shows the results obtained for event processing for English and Spanish. application of lexical semantics and semantic roles is complementary. For Spanish, the highest error reduction was also ob-tained by the combination (17%). We used a paired t-test to verify that the improvements are significant with a confidence above 95%. 10
For English, lexical semantics improved the baseline in cases such as that of (31). (31) TempEval-2 test set  X  file: APW19980306.1001  X  sentence: 0 (32) This is your work.

The noun  X  X  X ork X  X  is an event in (31) but not in other situations such as (32). Since there are more instances of this noun for many nominal events (e.g., inspection, occupation, negotiations, invasion).

The application of semantic roles increased the number of correctly recognized events. In (33a) and (33b), the events  X  X  X hakeup X  X  and  X  X  X nspection X  X  were missed by the baseline and TIPSem-LS but were correctly recognized by using semantic roles. (33) a. TempEval-2 test set  X  file: wsj _ 0586  X  sentence: 38
The baseline fails because these lemmas do not appear in the training. Although lexical semantics increases the proba-roles are concerned, another sign adds probability to the model. Since they hold the A1 role, and many nominal events tion X  X  holds the A1 role for the verb  X  X  X o carry out X  X , which normally defines events (e.g., carry out + action/process).
With Spanish, since the properties of the evaluation data signified that the baseline had already obtained an F there was less room for improvement. However, the performance was still improved by using semantics, for instance in (34). (34) TempEval-2 test set  X  file: 108 _ 20000301 _ b.txt  X  sentence: 8
In this sentence, the noun  X  X  sorteo  X  X  (EN: draw) is an event that was missed by the baseline. However, the combination of lexical semantics ( top 4 hypers = event) and semantic roles ( role = A1) assisted in the correct recognition.
The contribution of semantics to event recognition is focused on recall. The precision obtained is comparable to that ob-tained by human annotators (agreement of 81%), and its improvement is thus difficult if a high recall is to be maintained. 0.80 (0.70) for TIPSem. For Spanish, it ranges from 0.66 (0.57) to 0.68 (0.60).
 application of semantics, we carried out the classification of the total events recognized by the best recognition approach
TIPSem as we did for timex. The results obtained for English and Spanish were the same for the baseline and TIPSem clas-sense (most frequent). Moreover, verbal events like  X  X  X o complete X  X  may represent an puzzle A 1 ]) or an ASPECTUAL event (e.g., [He A 0 ] completed [the transaction the same values for the role-based features.

Although the current semantic features are not discriminative, we noted that the semantic features could aid in classifi-cation with the following updates. With regard to lexical semantics, the application of word sense disambiguation (WSD) another event (e.g., transaction) may aid the classification.

This performance distribution do not match the training example distribution shown in Table 3 , and the results obtained instead indicate the complexity of each different class.

For Spanish, perception (1.0), reporting (0.86) and occurrence (0.77) again obtained the highest results, while i_state (0.55), aspectual (0.54) and i_action (0.46) obtained a lower performance. However, state events obtained a score of 0.72.
Although the datasets for English and Spanish are different in content, and the results are not directly comparable, they tained in the English experiment (0.33). Moreover, if we observe the training example distribution, the proportion of state events, which does not occur in the English dataset. 4.3. Comparing results with the baseline, the state of the art, and between English and Spanish
This subsection presents the results previously analyzed in a comparative chart. Fig. 4 illustrates the results for English of-the-art (SoA) appears in hatched white. The scores shown for the classification correspond to its normalized value tion, these columns are empty.

TIPSem outperforms the baseline (TIPSem-B) in all tasks for both languages. This indicates that semantic knowledge is nificant improvement in recognition tasks. For timexes, this improvement occurs as a result of the direct relation between these elements with temporal roles and with temporal semantic classes in WordNets. For events, the semantic knowledge aided learning in more general models based on the event-related semantic classes, the detection of main verbs, and the identification of semantic roles that often contain events.

The state-of-the-art is outperformed by TIPSem. This indicates that the approach presented herein addresses the pro-posed problem in a highly competent manner. Our approach was considerably better than SoA in event recognition, thus indicating that semantic knowledge is needed to achieve a high-performance in this task. TIPSem results are also an improvement on those obtained in TempEval-2 with its earlier version, indicating that the individualized treatment of tim-el (LWLM) to timex recognition. Their approach (0.84 F1) does not outperform TIPSem, but it showed that LWLM is beneficial. It would be interesting to add this new semantic knowledge to TIPSem in order to verify whether it improves the results.

The results for English and Spanish cannot be compared because, although both consist of news articles, the datasets are training data size is slightly greater than that used for English. 5. Conclusions and further work
This paper analyzes the application of semantic knowledge to the automatic recognition and classification of temporal expressions and events in English and Spanish. The performance level of these tasks is crucial for high performance in the broader task of temporal information processing. Our aim is to ascertain whether the use of semantics leads to an improve-ment on the results obtained by state-of-the-art approaches which are principally based on morphosyntax.
The specific goals of this paper are: (i) to analyze the advantages that lexical semantics (semantic networks) and semantic English and Spanish, evaluating the degree of language independence of these advantages.

We have therefore presented a data-driven approach (TIPSem), which uses semantic knowledge in addition to morpho-syntax. We have evaluated TIPSem for English and Spanish over the datasets employed in the last international evaluation exercise on temporal information processing (TempEval-2). In order to measure the influence of semantics, the results have been compared with a baseline (TIPSem-B) which only uses morphosyntactic information, and with the state-of-the-art.
The results demonstrate that semantic knowledge is particularly useful for recognition tasks, showing an F1 error reduc-tion of 59% for timexes and of 21% for events. This improvement has been proven to be statically significant with a confi-dence of 95%. The contribution of lexical semantics and semantic roles has been found to be complementary, so that their of timexes and events which only share semantic properties. Semantics also helped in the recognition of timexes and events that were ambiguous at lower language analysis levels. With regard to classification, the application of semantics did not lead to a remarkable improvement, since the semantic features applied are not sufficiently discriminative. Although our ap-proach did not show conclusive improvements, after analyzing the causes, we have proposed more advanced semantic fea-tures that might be discriminative, as is discussed in Section 4 .

As compared with the state-of-the-art, TIPSem outperforms other approaches, particularly in event recognition. This sup-ports the hypothesis that semantic knowledge is needed to achieve high performance. These results are also an improvement and events with specific feature sets is useful.

Although we applied a combination of semantic features to timex and event extraction, these features may be useful for other information processing tasks, particularly those that face morphosyntactic ambiguity, or those in which the training have been applied to Information Retrieval and Question Answering ( Moreda, Navarro, &amp; Palomar, 2007; Moreda et al., 2011 ).

As further work, we shall add to TIPSem other kinds of semantic knowledge (i.e., LWLM), which have been shown to be proved by using word sense disambiguation techniques, in addition to intra-sentential syntactic and semantic dependencies between events.
