 With the explosion of social media over the past decade, more and more user-generated data is available on the Web for expressing users X  opinions and emo-tions. Among various types of social media, online news is an important form that attracts billions of users to read, and actively respond. Opinions and emotions of individual users often have huge impacts on other users and the community. Users often have subjective emotions such as sadness, surprise and anger after reading the online news articles. Grasping such emotions can help understand the perspectives and preferences of individual users, and thus may facilitate online publishers to provide more personalized services or statistically study readers X  attitudes toward social events. Emotion tagging for online news is an applica-tion of the research area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which has attracted much attention in information retrieval and natural language process-ing communities.

Conventional emotion tagging research primarily focuses on determining the emotions of the authors who created the articles, while few focus on the reader X  X  perspective. Reader X  X  emotion predictio n study aims to explore the reader X  X  emo-tions aroused by the affective text. Evid ences have shown that reader X  X  emotions are not necessarily consistent with writer X  X  [16]. Moreover, the existing works on emotion prediction from r eader X  X  perspectives [6] are mostly based on single-label classification techniques which are concerned with learning from a set of online news that are each associated wi th a single emotion label. It is conflict to the observation that some news articles could belong to multiple emotional states. An increasing number of social news websites provide a novel service via which users can share their emotions after reading news articles by voting for a set of predefined emotion tags. Fig. 1 shows an example from a popular Chinese news website (i.e., Sina News 1 ). We can observe that the news article evokes more than one major emotion, including sad, angry and sympathetic. Therefore, it is desirable that automatic emotion tagging be regarded as a multi-label clas-sification task which can predict one or more than one emotions. To the best of our knowledge, the existing literature contains no study on multi-label reader X  X  emotion tagging for online news, which is to be discussed in this paper.
Most existing multi-label classification methods are word-level models. How-ever, the underlying assumption that  X  X ord X  is the only essential feature in emotion tagging has many flaws. one same word always has different emotions in different subjects or contexts. Besides, some background words will bring noise because each word is regarded independently in the word-level emotion lexicon, many relevant words associated with certain emotions are usually mixed with background noisy words which do not co nvey affective meaning [1]. Therefore, it is more sensible to associate emotions with a specific emotional topic, which means a real-world event, object or abst ract entity that indicates the subject or context of the emotion, inst ead of only a single word.

In this paper, we propose a multi-label supervised emotion-topic model (ML-sETM) for tagging the emotions of the document effectively. In more details, the model follows a three-step generation pr ocess, which first gen erates an emotion from a document-specific emotion distributions with an emotion prior, then gen-erates a latent topic conditioned on the emotion and finally generates document terms based on the latent topic as the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [2]. The ML-sETM model is supervised by the observed emotion label set and associates each topic with reader emotions jointly as well as distinguishes between different emotions of the same word since the expression of emotion is characterized by its topic rather than an individual word.
 We evaluate the proposed model on an online news corpus collected from the Sina news website. Experimental results show that the proposed model concerns multi-label classification for news articles and can classify the documents into emotion categories more effectively compared to the state-of-art models.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first piece of research that focuses on modeling multi-label emotion tagging for online news from reader X  X  perspectives. Our proposed model can be also generali zed and applied to the other multi-label applications.

The rest of the paper is organized as fo llows. Section 2 reviews some related work. Section 3 formalizes the multi-label emotion tagging problem and describes our proposed ML-sETM model. Datasets and experimental results are discussed in Section 4. The last section provides conclusions and possible future work. Sentiment analysis [7] has become an important subfield of information manage-ment. Past researches on sentiments delivered by documents focused on detecting the sentiment that the authors of the documents were expressing. Pang etal. [8] exploited the positive or negative sentiment contained in movie reviews by applying support vector machines (SVM) with word unigram features. Quan and Ren [9] built the emotion lexicons for eight basic emotions and computed the similarities between sentences and the ei ght emotion lexicons to recognize the emotions presented in a sentence. Mishne [4] classified blog text according to the emotion reported by its author during the writing using SVM.

While the author might insert certain emotion and opinions towards the facts by omitting or stressing upon some aspect of text, the interpretation of the text largely depends on the personal background knowledge. Due to this emotion bias, only emotions of readers can accura tely represent the emotion categories of online news. Therefore, researches begin to focus on analyzing the emotion expressed explicitly by readers. Lin etal. [6] firstly studied the emotions of read-ers and classified documents into reader -emotion categories. They also studied the approaches to ranking reader emotions of documents by either minimizing pairwise ranking errors or utilizing regression to model emotion distributions [5]. Zhang etal. [19,20] proposed a meta-classification model and corresponding domain adaption approaches for predicting emotions for the comments of online news from reader X  X  perspective.

Since news always evokes multiple emotions of readers, predicting emotions of news can be formulated as a multi-label classification task to more accurately describe the emotions of readers. Tsoumakas and Katakis [13] reviewed the multi-label classification methods and grouped the existing methods into two main categories: problem transformation methods and algorithm adaption methods [18]. The first category is to transform the multi-label classification problem either into one or more single-label classification or regression problems, such as Binary Relevance (BR), Classifier Chains (CC) [12], Calibrated Label Ranking (CLR) [3] and RAndom k -labELsets (RA k EL) [15]. The second category is to extend specific learning algorithms to handle multi-label data directly. ML k NN is considered as one of the widely-used algorithm adaption methods [18].
However, most multi-label classification methods mainly focus on exploiting the sentiments of individual words. The same word in different subjects or con-texts may express different emotions. As a r esult, it is more sensible to associate emotions with a specific emotional topic instead of only a single word. Bao etal. [1] proposed an emotion-topic model (ETM) to explore the sentiments of partic-ular topics. ETM is a joint emotion-topic model that introduces an intermediate layer into Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [5] to bridge the gap between emo-tions and topics. Unfortunately, ETM is criticized for only annotating emotions from the writer X  X  perspective. Therefore, Rao etal. [10,11] came up with the sentiment topic models and affective topic model to associate latent topics with evoked emotions of readers. Nonetheless, few of topic-based sentiment analysis methods can be applied to solve the multi-label emotion classification problems.
In light of these considerations, we here develop a supervised topic model for multi-label emotion classification for online news from reader X  X  perspective. This section introduces our proposed supervised topic model for multi-label emotion tagging for online news, namely Multi-label supervised Emotion-Topic Model (ML-sETM). Before providing the details of this model, we first briefly introduce the problem definition and notations that will be used to describe the ML-sETM model.
 3.1 Problem Definition In this paper, we cast predicting emotions for online news into a multi-label classification problem that classifies news articles into multiple emotion tags. The with a vocabulary V , an emotion category set is defined as E = { e 1 ,e 2 ,...,e M } . Multi-label emotion tagging problem is to tag online news with a corresponding subset of predefined emotion labels E  X  X  utilizing a set of labeled news articles D . A news article is described as a feature vector w = { w i } ( i =1 , 2 ,...,V )where V is the number of distinct words in vocabulary V . For convenience, we associate each news article with a ta rget indicator variable  X  = {  X  k } ( k =1 , 2 ,...,M ) denotes which emotions evoked by the news article. More precisely,  X  k equals to 1 if the news article d is tagged with emotion e k or 0 otherwise. Thus the labeled where n is the number of labeled news articles. The set of all possible emotion label combinations can be written as U = { 0 , 1 } M , thus the multi-label classifier can be expressed as a decision function f : D X  X  .

Traditional classification models dealing with multi-labeled data simply treat words individually without considering the contextual information. While it is more sensible to utilize topic model to discover the topics from document, it fails to bridge the connection between reader  X  X  emotions and effective words. So our objective is to accurately model the conn ection between reader X  X  emotions and specific topics and utilize the emotion label set to guide the topic generation. 3.2 Multi-Label Supervised Emotion-Topic Model In this paper, we propose a supervised topic model for multi-label emotion tag-ging for online news called multi-label supervised emotion-topic model (ML-sETM). The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, also referred to as topic model, is an unsupervised learning technique for extracting topics from a corpus. However, as an unsupervised model it can not directly applicable to document classification problem and fails to brid ge the connection between reader X  X  emo-tions and words. The proposed ML-sETM model incorporates supervision of observed emotion labels to guide the doc ument generation process and accounts for emotion labels by introducing an additional emotion layer to traditional LDA.
The proposed multi-label supervised em otion-topic model (ML-sETM) is rep-resented as a probabilistic graphical model in Fig. 2. Formally, let M be the number of emotion labels and K be the number of latent topics in the corpus. Each topic is modeled as a multinomial distribution  X  over observed words and each emotion label is modeled as a multinomial distribution  X  over topics.  X  and z are corresponding emotion and topic assignment for word w .Fordocument d , both the words as well as the emotion labels are observed variables. The random vector  X  is sampled from a symmetric Dirichlet distribution with hyperparameter  X  andsupervisedbyitsemotionlabels  X  . Given the distribution over emotions  X  , the ML-sETM model generat es latent topics and words similar to LDA model. The generative process for ML-sETM is shown below. 1. For each emotion choose  X   X  Dirichlet (  X |  X  ) 2. For each topic choose  X   X  Dirichlet (  X |  X  ) 3. Choose  X  d  X  Dirichlet (  X |  X  )  X  ( d ) is restricted to only over the emotions corresponding to its emotion labels  X  ( d ) by setting the probability of irrelevant emotions to zero in order to ensure that all the emotion assignments are limited to the emotion labels of online news. 3.3 Model Learning and Inference Since it is intractable to perform an exact inference for the multi-labeled emotion-topic model, we use an approximate inference method based on Gibbs sampling. According to the above generative process, the joint probability of all the random variables for a document collection is For each word, we estimate the posterior distribution on emotion e and topic z based on the following conditional probabilities, which can be derived by marginalizing the above joint probabilities in Equation 1.

P (  X  i = e |  X   X  i ,z,w ;  X ,  X ,  X  )  X 
Where e and z are the candidate emotion and topic for sampling, respectively. d  X  D indicates the document from which the current word w is the number of times topic z has been assigned to emotion e , N  X  i number of words in document d i has been assigned to emotion e . Similarly, n  X  i  X  ,z,w is the number of times a word w has been assigned to topic z . The superscript -i means the count that does not include the current assignment of emotion and topic for word w i , respectively.

In more details, we start the algorithm by randomly assigning all the words to emotions and topics. Then we repeat Gibbs sampling on each word in the document collection by applying the Equation 2 and the Equation 3 sequentially. This sampling process is repeated for I iterations when the stop condition is met. With the sampled topics and emotions available, it is easy to estimate the distribution of  X  ,  X  and  X  as follows: Once the emotion-topic distribution  X  e,z and topic-word distribution  X  z,w are learned from the training set, during testing time (document labels are un-known), our model is free to sample from any of M emotion labels, and any K topics in ML-sETM. For no ambiguity, given the optimal  X  e,z and  X  z,w ,we simply reword a full cycle update process of the inference method here as follows: 1. Update the assignment of the word tokens to one of M emotions by 2. Update the assignment of the word tokens to one of K topics by 3. After I iterations, we predict a testing document d via the estimation of posterior over emotions  X  d,e by the Equation 4. A threshold method [14] defined as the Equation 9 can decide whether an emotion is included in the final output for a given testing document. where p is the threshold and g j ,( j =1 ,...,M ) is the predicted score of emotion label e j for a given test document. In this section, we first introduce the experimental setups including datasets, comparison baselines and evaluation met rics. We then report an extensive set of experiment results of proposed model an d baseline methods and finally explore the influence of parameters in our model. Analysis and discussions are presented based on the results. 4.1 Experimental Setups Dataset. We collected most-viewed online n ews between January and June in 2011 from the society channel of Sina News. The online users voted these news articles with one of the eight social emotions, including touched, sympathetic, bored, angry, amused, sad, surprised and fervent. We can only utilize this Chinese dataset since we have not found similar emotion votes services in English yet, but the proposed model is language independent. We extracted the title and main body as the content of each news article, then segmented all news articles to terms with a Chinese word segmentation software ICTCLAS [17] and at last removed the most general terms and the most sparse terms. A threshold method defined as Equation 9 assigned multiple emotion labels for the news articles by selecting the representative emotion l abels voted by online users. The applied dataset after preprocessing and cleaning contained 4,383 distinct terms in 4,654 news articles. The statistics of top ranked emotion label sets are listed in Table 1. In the whole dataset, 25.01% have two emotion labels, 10.06% have three emotion labels and about 3.5% have four or more emotion labels. As previously discussed, a large amount of news articles evoke more than one emotion. It is therefore necessary to classify emotions with multiple labels rather than only a single label.
 Comparison Baselines. We have selected several well-known modern high-performing methods from the literature for our benchmark comparison. For easy reference, Table 2 lists all the algorithms compared in the experiments, their corresponding abbreviations, some default parameters, and citations. We adapt Multi-class Logistic Regression (MLR) to the multi-label emotion tagging problem using the same threshold method, due to MLR X  X  effective performance in the single-label classification task [19]. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is chosen as base classifier for problem transformation methods including BR, CC, RA k EL and CLR, since SVM performs bes t among several base classifiers in the multi-label classification task [13].
 Evaluation Metrics. The evaluation metrics ar e different from those used in single-labeled classification problems. Here we use an evaluation dataset of emotion multi-label examples ( x i ,Y i )( i =1 , 2 ,...n ), where Y i  X  X  is the set of true labels and E = { e 1 ,e 2 ,...,e M } is the set of all labels. Given an instance x , the set of labels predicted by a mul ti-label classifier is denoted as Z i ,where Z are widely used in the literature and indicative of the performance of multi-label classification methods [13]. 1. HammingLoss 2. subsetAcc 3. F  X  measure 4.2 The Performance of Multi-Label Emotion Tagging Models Experiments in this section investigat e the effectiveness of our proposed ML-sETM model and baseline methods with 10-fold cross-validation in the multi-label emotion tagging task.

The hyperparameters  X  and  X  of ML-sETM are set to symmetric Dirichlet priors with values of  X  =50 /K ,  X  =0 . 1, similar to previous work [2]. The hyperparameter  X  is set as 50/K. For the topic number, we find ML-sETM performs best when K = 650 by empirical study. The choice of topic number and  X  will be discussed in Section 4.3 in detail.

Table 3 summarizes the evaluation results of the proposed ML-sETM model and baseline methods. Obviously, the proposed ML-sETM model leads the per-formance in most cases. Based on these results, we can make the following ob-servations: 1) MLR performs worst in terms of all evaluation measures, which validates the necessity of multi-label classification methods of emotion tagging for online news. 2) ML k NN performs worse according to HammingLoss and subsetAcc and better according to F  X  measure . This means that besides the emotion labels that are originally relevant, ML k NN predicts non-relevant emo-tion labels as relevant. 3) Among the four kinds of Problem Transformation methods, BR performs worst since BR tackles the multi-label classification prob-lem by simply splitting the original multi-labeled dataset into M single-labeled datasets, which will easily lead to data skew problem. CC and RA k EL per-form better than BR and ML k NN by considering the co rrelations between the different emotion labels of each instan ce. This reflects that the emotion label correlations may provide helpful extra information. 4) ML-sETM consistently outperforms all the existing multi-label classification algorithms above. This in-dicates that it is more effective to associate topic information of online news with emotion labels. In addition, a pair ed t-test shows that all improvements of ML-sETM over BR, ML k NN, CC, RA k EL and CLR are statistically significant with p-value &lt; 0 . 001.
 4.3 The Influence of Parameters to ML-sETM Model The proposed ML-sETM model is conditioned on four parameters: the Dirichlet hyperparameters  X  ,  X  ,  X  and the number of latent topics K . Experiments in this section were conducted to explore the influence of different values of latent topics and hyperparameter  X  to our proposed model.
 Influence of Latent Topic Number. We first evaluate the influence of latent topic number K by fixing  X  ,  X  and  X  and explore the consequence of varying K , ranging from 50 to 800. In particular, we set  X  =  X  =50 /K and  X  =0 . 1 with 500 iterations and 10-fold cross-validation. Fig. 3 shows the performance on ML-sETM with a growing number of topic numbers. We omitted subsetAcc due to it X  X  consistency with F  X  Measure and the limited space. It can be seen that the performance of ML-sETM model converges when K is larger than 400 and reaches a peak at K = 650. This indicates that when the topic number equals to 650, our ML-sETM is being rich enough to fit the information available in the data, yet not as complex as being fitting noise. Therefore we can conclude that the topic number can be treated as the discriminate granularity of the ML-sETM model and it operates a tradeoff between the generality and specificity. Influence of Hyperparameters. There are three hyperparameters in ML-sETM model  X  ,  X  and  X  , the choice of which has important implications for the results produced by ML-sETM model. Similar to previous work [1][2],  X  and  X  are set to symmetric Dirichlet prior with the value of 50 /K and 0.1, respectively. The hyperparameter  X  represents the prior observation counts for the number of times emotions sampled from topic before any emotion label is observed, which can reflect how different the documents a re in terms of emotion labels. We fix topic number K = 400 and vary the value of  X  from 0.01 to 1.

The experimental results with different values of  X  is exhibited in Fig 4. We can make the following observations: 1) The ML-sETM model gets best performance when the value of  X  equals to 50 /K . 2) The variance of HammingLoss and F-Measure are 0.0093 and 0.0151 respectively, which are all smaller than the variance of different topic numbers. This indicates that the performance of ML-sETM model with hyperparameter  X  is more stable than parameter K . This paper proposes a novel framework to address the task of predicting multiple reader X  X  emotion for online news by supervised topic model. Specifically, we incorporate supervision of observed emotion labels to guide the topic generation and introduce an additional emotion layer into LDA to associate each topic with reader X  X  emotions jointly. As far as we know, this is the first piece of research on multi-label emotion tagging for online news from reader X  X  perspectives. The empirical results on real dataset have shown the effectiveness of our approach.
This work is an initial step towards a promising research direction. In the future work, we will propose more sophisticated topic models by taking account of dependencies among emotions additionally. Furthermore, we will also conduct a more comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate the proposed model on more large-scale testbeds.
