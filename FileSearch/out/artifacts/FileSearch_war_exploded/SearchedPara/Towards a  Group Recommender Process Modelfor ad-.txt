 Movie recommender systems simplify the movie selection by providing movie suggestions based on the respective user X  X  personal taste. Most of the current systems address individual users, support stationary use, and require pre-configuration. In this paper we present an approach for group recommendations for movies based on a novel group recommender process model for ad-hoc groups with on-demand recommendations.

Recommender systems provide users personalised suggestions of choices to make that facilitate their decision-making espe-cially in situations where they lack the personal experience of the alternatives [10]. They  X  X reate recommendations tailored to individual users rather than universal recommendations for, well, everyone X  [5, p. 15].
 Early related work focused on individual users in work settings with stationary use. Many use collaborative filtering of user ratings for email recommendations based on users X  annotations (e.g., Tapestry [2]) and for Usenet News recommendations based on users X  ratings (e.g., GroupLens [9]). More recent sys-tems still mostly target at single users, but in leisure and mo-bile scenarios. Some use preferences and locations of users to make real-time suggestions of places (e.g., Restaurant Recom-mendation [8]); others synchronise recommendations from personal computers to mobile devices to provide later offline recommendations on the spot (e.g., MovieLens Unplugged [4]). Only few aim to support groups to find a compromise. For instance, PolyLens [7] provides group recommendations as single movies fitting the group members X  taste best. The AGReMo group interaction concept leverages on the group process model and was designed to facilitate the interaction of the group with the AGReMo app. It combines the theoretical concepts of the process model with the practical insight gained from low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototyping of the AGReMo app. The AGReMo group interaction concept follows the above phases and was implemented in the AGReMo app for the Apple iPhone. Subsequently we describe the concept from the perspective of the users using the AGReMo app. The users start with the Preparation Phase. The group meets and specifies its preferences. As personal preferences, individual users rate movies they already watched. The system then gener-ates individual profiles based on each user X  X  ratings. After login the main view of the AGReMo app (cf. Figure 2) allows starting a recommendation process and shows recent group recommendations. The agent, on which the group mem-bers agree, specifies the group X  X  preferences, and enters the essential and optional attributes on one view.
 Essential attributes are group members, vote weights of the group members, and date and time to watch the movie. The agent selects group members from a friend list. In the AGReMo system, by default all group members have the same vote weight, but it can be doubled or tripled for privileged group members. A drop-down list presents the selection for date and time.
 Optional attributes are a pre-selection of cinemas and movies. A list of cinemas (with details on each cinema on demand) is generated automatically according to the current position. The agent can deselect cinemas to exclude. A list of movies is automatically populated through the selected cinemas and show time. The agent can also deselect movies that the group does not want. The agent then sends a request for movie recommen-dations.
 In the Decision Phase the system merges the predictions to movie recommendations by maximising the minimal frustra-
