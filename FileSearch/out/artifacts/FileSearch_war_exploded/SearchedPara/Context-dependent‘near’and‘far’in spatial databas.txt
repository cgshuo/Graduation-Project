 1. Introduction comparative and superlative forms (e.g.  X  is Ghandi's nearer than Taj Mahal? answers, which restaurants qualify as  X  near  X  seems open to interpretation and arbitrary. In short, and Taj Mahal are both within 300 m of your current position. Of course context is a rather broad notion so let us stipulate the following three types:
Speaker context involves the speaker's goals, capacities and preferences. In the case of walking or driving, if they are in good health, if they are under time pressure, etc. location of the speaker and restaurants, but not track the weather.
 contexts (e.g. c 1 ) exists, whatever they are, and by giving them descriptive names (e.g. c at the capitol building in Washington, DC, we might assert Near ( Whthouse ,
We might elect to say neither Near ( WhtHouse ,  X  15-min-walk questions might be to ask whether there exists a context c
Now that we have largely side-stepped context, this paper will focus on representing vagueness of described in this paper is part of this project and addresses the special case of representing practical motivation for focussing on  X  near  X  and  X  far  X  restaurants are near the university?  X  ,  X  which hotels are near the white house but far from a highway? of spatial scenes could be described using such vague spatial predicates (e.g. objects that overlap one another) or they work hard to answer 1.1. Organization of this article with a wider discussion of alternative and future work. The work is also more focussed on the case of follow up on the more extended cases of  X  next-to  X  and  X  basing it on a concrete example for the North Western Washington, DC portion of the discussion of the work as well as criticisms and future directions. Section 6 summarizes and concludes. 2. Background 2.1. General accounts of vagueness
If a user requests  X  list the buses that travel down D st.  X  precise contexts vague relations are still inquiry resistant.
 continue adding stones to the collection with it never attaining the status of a  X  height), then we must state that the other person is also arbitrarily large height are  X  short  X  . Clearly somewhere the induction step must break down. nearness: would be  X  near  X  .

Non-transi tivity states that if object x is  X  near  X  to object y and object y is object x is  X  near  X  to object z .

We refer the interested reader to [20] . 2.2. Supervaluation  X  consistent settings of n 1 in a straightforward way (e.g. n wishes to simply use the system to deduce membership or non-membership in vague relations. parameter that determines when a distance is definitely not (  X  predicates for values in some gap. For example in the most conservative setting and n 2 = 9. Instead of embracing partial logic, a work around is to simply introduce an we have the rule, (  X  x )( x &gt; n 2  X  far ( x )) and the rule that determines mutual exclusion: ( far or neither. This gives us our  X  gaps  X  that are needed to model inquiry resistance. vague predicates and degree modifiers [15]. 2.3. Vague relations in spatial databases Typically spatial databases represent regions by adding geometric types ( as conditions or terms in queries. The canonical types of crisp queries are point queries (e.g. queries (e.g.  X  what are the Chinese restaurants between H and F streets and 9th and 11th streets? the nearest ATM from the corner of 9th street and F street? operators and functions we seek to support spatial predicates explicitly side step  X  vague, ambiguous and context dependent expressions 3. An approach to context-dependent near and far answers A is: to (or  X  far  X  from) object y in context c .The val function represents the assume this distance function is the straight line distance metric geometries (i.e. points, polygons or lines). 3.1. The de fi nition of the context-dependent near and far
Ignoring types for now, the main rules that define the vague predicates are:
These rules provide the necessary and sufficient conditions a given context, then two objects are  X  near  X  to (or  X  far parameters low ( c ) and high ( c ), for they are to be constrained by observations. rules are limited to the Horn property gives us a tractable algorithm.
Finally we model the  X  opposite  X  relation between near and far in a given context via: 3.2. Calculating thresholds from context-dependent observations
By way of example let us consider observations over the contexts c c =  X  short bicycle ride  X  . In the scene 4 in Fig. 2 we may have observations of the following sort:
Based on a set of such observations, the most conservative setting of the thresholds could be low ( c low ( c 2 ) = 750, high ( c 2 ) = 5000 and low ( c 3 ) = 780, high ( c 3.3. Representing and comparing contexts false) in contexts. To achieve this we include a predicate ist ( p , c ) (standing for on-foot, raining, day-time, on-bike. Thus we might have the following facts: ist (on-foot, c  X  ist (on-bike, c 1 ),  X  ist (on-bike, c 2 ), ist (on-bike, c ist(raining , ci) nor ist(raining , ci) will be asserted.
 contexts: Possibly equal ( c i  X  c j ) say that two contexts c i and c j are possibly equal (denoted c our example ist and observations in Section 3.2, none of the contexts can possibly be equal to one another. Generality ( c i  X  c j )
Ignoring observations we can speak of context c i being at least as general as a context c testing the consistency of these rules with the ist facts. A context c In our example c 1  X  c 2 .
 More discerning ( c i  X  c j ) is at least as discerning as c j (denoted c i  X  c j ) if everything that is context c i more discerning as c j (denoted c i  X  c j )if c following rules to the above rules and observations and test for consistency:
In our example above, it is the case that c 1  X  c 2 . 3.4. Generating views capture what is  X  near  X  and  X  far  X  in a given context. Thus the view definition of that are  X  near  X  to one another in the given context. Its form is a straightforward result of pairs
CREATE VIEW NEAR(id1,id2,context) AS for FAR(XID, YID, CONTEXT) .
 3.5. Multiple distance metrics
In practice, it is often the case that a straight line distance measure is an unreliable metric of existence of a subway system warps the notion of what is  X  fairly straightforward to develop a metric  X  driving , it is even feasible that we can develop then imagine composing these to generate metric functions such as above become:
This will then necessitate the assignment of distance metrics to various contexts:
While this requires slightly more knowledge engineering, it does not alter the tractability of the approach. 3.6. Type dependence
Based on our intuition that a person being  X  near  X  a waste paper basket and a person being the basic case although it results in many more rules  X  quadratic in the number of types. etc. For example: proposed in [14]) of including types in the rules. 4. Prototype implementation The approach of Section 3 is implemented in an initial LISP prototype integrated with the theorem prover calculated relationships between contexts and the view expressions that define the context-dependent
The query tool lets casual users obtain answers to  X  near 4.1. The teacher tool propositions in contexts to true , false or unknown , and then to make statements of what is
These descriptive names (e.g. a  X  5-minute sprint in the rain c exists a context c j , where c i  X  c j and c j  X  c i and c irrelevant. Likewise a new context c i that is more general than a prior context c teacher can author contexts as they see fit.
 definitions. This is achievable in polynomial time (see [14]). 4.1.1. Core reasoning services encode the vague observations, the ist statements, the unique names assumption and d , ... , d n . This includes Horn-based constraints such as: tractable. Further experiments are underway to improve our prototype's performance. 4.2. The query tool Given that we have the view, materialized or otherwise, that defines the vague predicate library, this will mean that a family of possible thresholds will be possible. predicates based on world state (e.g. the weather or time of day) or via explicit questions (e.g. context, etc. until all possible contexts are addressed or ruled out. 5. Discussion
The original ambition of this article was to cover a wide class of vague spatial preposition including etc. As it turned out, we decided to focus our attention on the more limited case of and varied cases.
