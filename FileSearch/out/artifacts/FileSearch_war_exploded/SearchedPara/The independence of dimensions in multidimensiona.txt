 Studies of human dialogue behaviour indicate that natural dialogue utterances are very often multifunc-tional. This observation has inspired the develop-ment of multidimensional approaches to dialogue analysis and annotation, e.g. (Allen &amp; Core, 1997) , (Larsson, 1998), (Popescu-Belis, 2005), (Bunt, 2006). The most frequently used annotation scheme that implements this approach is DAMSL (Allen and Core, 1997), which allows multiple labels to be assigned to utterances in four layers: Communica-tive Status, Information Level, Forward-Looking Function (FLF) and Backward-Looking Function (BLF). The FLF layer is subdivided into five classes, including (roughly) the classes of commissive and directive functions, well known from speech act the-ory. The BLF layer has four classes: Agreement, Understanding, Answer, and Information Relation. These nine classes, also referred to as  X  X imensions X , form mutually exclusive sets of tags; no further mo-tivation is given for the particular choice of classes.
Popescu-Belis (2005) argues that dialogue act tagsets should seek a multidimensional theoretical grounding and defines the following aspects of ut-terance function that could be relevant for choosing dimensions (1) the traditional clustering of illocu-tionary forces in speech act theory into five classes: Representatives, Commissives, Directives, Expres-sives and Declarations; (2) turn management; (3) ad-jacency pairs; (4) topical organization in dialogue; (5) politeness functions; and (6) rhetorical roles.
Structuring an annotation scheme by grouping re-lated communicative functions into clusters makes the structure of the schema more transparent. Such clusters or  X  X imensions X  are usually defined as a set of functions related to the same type of infor-mation, such as Acknowledging, Signalling Under-standing and Signalling Non-understanding, or Dia-logue Opening and Dialogue Closing. Bunt (2006) shows that this does not always lead to a notion of dimension that has any conceptual and theoretical significance, and argues that some of the function classes of DAMSL do not constitute proper dimen-sions.

In particular, a theoretically grounded multidi-mensional schema should provide an account of the possible multifunctionality of dialogue utterances. In (Bunt, 2006); (Bunt and Girard, 2005) a dimen-sion in dialogue act analysis is defined as an aspect of participating in dialogue which can be addressed:  X  by dialogue acts which have a function specifi- X  independently of the other dimensions.
 The independence of dimensions, required by this definition, has the effect that an utterance may have a function in one dimension independent of the func-tions that it may have in other dimensions, and helps to explain why utterances may have multiple func-tions. Moreover, it leads to more manageable and more adaptable annotation schemas (compared to, for instance, DAMSL and its derivatives), since it al-lows annotators to leave out certain dimensions that they are not interested in, or to extend the schema with additional dimensions; and it allows restricting or modifying the set of tags in a particular dimension without affecting the rest of the schema.

Based on the above definition and extensive theo-retical and empirical studies, 10 dimensions are de-the domain or task/activity ( Task ); feedback on the processing of previous utterances by the speaker ( Auto-feedback ) or by other interlocutors ( Allo-feedback ); managing difficulties in the speaker X  X  ut-terance production ( Own-Communication Manage-ment, OCM ) or that of other interlocutors ( Partner Communication Management, PCM ); the speaker X  X  need for time to continue the dialogue ( Time Man-agement ); establishing and maintaining contact ( Contact Management ); the allocation of the next turn ( Turn Management ); the way the speaker is planning to structure the dialogue ( Dialogue Struc-turing ); and attention for social aspects of the inter-action ( Social Obligations Management, SOM ).
This paper investigates the independence of these ten dimensions. In Section 2 we discuss the notion of independence of dimensions and how it can be tested. Section 3 reports test results and Section 4 draws conclusions. We define two dimensions D1 and D2 in an anno-tation scheme to be independent iff (1) an utterance may be assigned a value in D1 regardless of whether it is assigned a value in D2; and (2) it is not the case that whenever an utterance has a value in D1, this
Dependences between dimensions can be de-termined empirically by analyzing annotated dia-logue data. Dimension tags which always co-occur are nearly certainly dependent; zero co-occurrence scores also suggest possible dependences. Besides co-occurrence scores, we also provide a statistical analysis using the phi coefficient as a measure of relatedness. The phi measure is related to the chi-square statistic, used to test the independence of cat-egorical variables, and is similar to the correlation coefficient in its interpretation.

If a dimension is not independent from other di-mensions, then there would be no utterances in the data which address only that dimension. We there-fore also investigate to which extent it happens that an utterance addresses only one dimension. We also investigate whether a dimension is addressed only in reaction to a certain other dimension. For example, the answer dimension as defined in DAMSL cannot be seen as independent, because answers need ques-tions in order to exist. The test here is to examine the relative frequencies of pairs &lt; dimension tag, previ-ous dimension tag &gt; .

To sum up, we performed four tests, examining: 1. the relative frequency of communicative func-2. the extent of relatedness between dimensions 3. for all dimensions whether there are utterances 4. the relative frequency of pairs of dimension and Since different types of dialogue may have differ-ent tag distributions, three different dialogue corpora have been examined: All three corpora were manually segmented and tagged according to the DIT ++ annotation scheme. The test results presented in this section are similar for all three corpora.

The co-occurrence results in Table 1 show no dependences between dimensions, although some combinations of dimensions occur frequently, e.g. time and turn management acts often co-occur. A speaker who wants to win some time to gather his thoughts and uses Stalling acts mostly wants to con-tinue in the sender role, and his stalling behaviour may be intended to signal that as well (i.e., to be interpreted as a Turn Keeping act). But stalling be-haviour does not always have that function; espe-cially an extensive amount of stallings accompanied by relatively long pauses may be intended to elicit support for completing an utterance.

It is also interesting to have a look at co-occurrences of communicative functions taking im-plicated and entailed functions into account (the cor-pora were reannotated for this purpose). An impli-cated function is for instance the positive feedback (on understanding and evaluating the preceding ut-terance(s) of the addressee) that is implied by an ex-pression of thanks; examples of entailed functions are the positive feedback on the preceding utterance that is implied by answering a question, by accept-ing an invitation, or by rejecting an offer.
Co-occurrence scores are higher when entailed and implicated functions are taken into account (the scores given in brackets in Table 1). For example, questions, which mostly belong to the Task dimen-sion, much of the time have an accompanying Turn Management function, either releasing the turn or assigning it to another dialogue participant, allow-ing the question to be answered. Similarly, when accepting a request the speaker needs to have the turn, so communicative functions like Accept Re-quest will often be accompanied by functions like Turn Take or Turn Accept. Such cases contribute to the co-occurrence score between the Task and Turn Management dimensions.

Table 1 shows that some dimensions do not oc-cur in combination. We do not find combinations of Contact and Time Management, Contact and Part-ner Communication Management, or Partner Com-munication Management and Discourse Structuring, for example. Close inspection of the definitions of the tags in these pairs of dimensions does not re-veal combination restrictions that would make one of these dimensions depend on the others.

Table 2 presents the extent to which dimensions are related when the corpus data are annotated with or without taking implicated and entailed functions into account, according to the calculated phi coeffi-cient.

No strong positive (phi values from .7 to 1.0) or negative (-.7 to -1.0) relations are observed. There is a weak positive association (.6) between Turn and Time Management (see co-occurrence analysis above) and between OCM and Turn Management (.4). Weak negative associations are observed be-tween Task and Auto-feedback (-.5) when entailed and implicated functions are not considered; be-tween Task and Contact Management (-.6); and be-tween Auto-and Allo-feedback (-.6) when entailed and implicated functions are included in the analy-sis. The weak negative association means that an utterance does not often have communicative func-tions in these two dimensions simultaneously. Some negative associations become positive if we take en-tailed and implicated functions into account, be-cause, as already noted, dialogue acts like answers, accepts and rejects, imply positive feedback.
The third independence test, mentioned above, shows that each dimension may be addressed by an utterance which does not address any other di-mension. The Task dimension is independently ad-dressed in 28.8% of the utterances; 14.2% of the ut-terances have a function in the Auto-Feedback di-mension only; for the other dimensions these fig-ures are 0.7% -Allo-Feedback; 7.4% -Turn Man-agement; 0.3% -Time Management; 0.1% -Contact Management; 1.9% -Discourse Structuring; 0.5% -OCM; 0.2% -PCM; and 0.3% -SOM.

We finally investigated the occurrences of tags given the tags of the previous utterances, taking five previous utterances into account. Table 3 shows no evidence of dependences across the dialogue his-tory. There are some frequent patterns, for example, retractions and self-corrections often follow hesita-tions because the speaker, while monitoring his own speech and noticing that part of it needs revision, needs time to construct the corrected part. In this paper we investigated the independence of the dimensions defined in the DIT ++ dialogue act annotation scheme, using co-occurrences matrices and the phi coefficient for measuring relatedness be-tween dimensions.

The results show that, although some dimensions are more related and co-occur more frequently than others, on the whole the ten DIT ++ dimensions may be considered to be independent aspects of communication.
