 Over the past two decades or so, Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs; also called Multi-word Units) have been an increasingly important concern for Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The term MWE has been used to refer to various types of linguistic units and expressions, including idioms, noun compounds, phrasal verbs, light verbs and other habitual collocations. However, while there is no universally agreed definition for MWE as yet, most researchers use the term to refer to those frequently occurring phrasal units which are subject to certain level of semantic opaqueness, or non-compositionality. Non-compositional MWEs pose tough challenges for automatic analysis because their interpretation cannot be achieved by directly combining the semantics of their constituents, thereby causing the  X  X  X ain in the neck of NLP X  X  (Sag et al. 2001 ).

In fact, MWEs have been studied for decades in Phraseology under the term phraseological unit . But in the early 1990s, MWEs started receiving increasing attention in corpus-based computational linguistics and NLP. Early influential work on MWEs includes Smadja ( 1993 ), Dagan and Church ( 1994 ), Wu ( 1997 ), Daille ( 1995 ), Wermter and Chen ( 1997 ), McEnery et al. ( 1997 ), and Michiels and Dufour ( 1998 ). These studies address the automatic treatment of MWEs and their applications in practical NLP and information systems. A milestone for MWE research is the Multiword Expression Project carried out at the Centre for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University, which began in 2001 to investigate a means to encode a variety of MWEs in precision grammars ( http://mwe.stanford.edu ). Other major work in this area has been carried out at Lancaster University, which resulted in a large collection of semantically annotated English, Finnish and Russian MWE dictionary resources for a semantic annotation tool (Rayson et al. 2004 ;Lo  X  fberg et al. 2005 ; Piao et al. 2006 ; Mudraya et al. 2006 ). With recent developments in the field of corpus linguistics, researchers from a number of different fields have been coming together to look at phraseology from a variety of perspectives (Granger and Meunier 2008 ).

Since 2003, the MWE research community has organised eight MWE-focused workshops in major conferences such as ACL and LREC, reflecting the importance of MWE research to the field. These include the following:  X  ACL X 2003 workshop titled Multiword Expressions: Analysis, Acquisition and  X  ACL X 2004 workshop titled Multiword Expressions: Integrating Processing and  X  2006:  X  ACL X 2007 workshop titled A Broader Perspective on Multiword Expressions  X  LREC X 2008 workshop titled Towards a Shared Task for Multiword Expressions  X  ACL X 2009 workshop titled Multiword Expressions: Identification, Interpretation,
As reflected in the workshop topics, the community has addressed the MWE issue from several perspectives. A first concern was automatic MWE identification and extraction, and a number of algorithms based on linguistic analysis and statistical measures have been suggested for this task, with varying degrees of success. Over the course of these workshops, it has become increasingly obvious that in order to develop more efficient algorithms, we need deeper understanding of the structural and semantic properties of MWEs, such as morpho-syntactic patterns, semantic compositionality, semantic behaviour in different contexts, cross-lingual transformation of MWE properties etc.

MWE compositionality, which concerns the degree of idiomaticity (i.e., how figuratively or literally a MWE is used), is another core issue. Compositionality determines the strategy needed to interpret and translate MWEs. In particular, the semantics of a highly compositional MWE can be interpreted by aggregating that of its constituent words, whereas for a highly idiomatic MWE, we would need to resort to contextual information and specific knowledge resources.
The proper evaluation of MWE tools based on a standard and shared testbed has also emerged as an important activity in the field. So far, most MWE tools have been tested and evaluated on different data, rendering them incomparable. In the LREC X 08 MWE workshop, significant steps were taken towards building an MWE evaluation framework, starting with creation of a website for MWE community to share ideas, tools and resources (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/multiword/ ).
In the past, most MWE research was centred on English, but recently increasing effort is being devoted to coverage of a wider range of languages, including German, Russian, French, Chinese, Estonian, Czech, to name a few. Multilingual MWE research can potentially bring significant benefit to the machine/computer-assisted translation systems (McNamee and Mayfield 2006 ).

After nearly two decades of effort, the computational linguistics and NLP communities have built a number of valuable MWE resources. For example, in the Multiword Expression Project of Stanford University, US a list of MWE resources of English Verb particle constructions were built ( http://mwe.stanford.edu/ resources/ ). In the UCREL centre of Lancaster University, UK, semantically clas-sified English and Russian MWE lexicons were built ( http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/usas/ ). In the SourceForge MWE site, a set of MWE resources for five languages are available (see http://multiword.sourceforge.net/PHITE.php?sitesig=FILES&amp;page= FILES_20_Data_Sets ). These MWE resources and tools are a valuable resource for real-world NLP applications. For example, mapping of query terms to synonymous MWEs can improve information retrieval systems, and efficient identification and mapping of true MWE translation equivalents cross languages can significantly improve the performance of machine translation systems. MWEs are also valuable to foreign language teaching assistant software, in which the automatic interpretation of idiomatic expressions plays an important role. MWE research also benefits text mining research, for which the identification of multiword concept terms is a critical component.

Despite the considerable effort that has been devoted to the MWE research, there is still long way to go. The MWE issue is a tough nut, but it needs to be cracked open to further improve NLP and information systems. We hope that the research reported in this special issue will help us move a step closer toward that goal.

This is the second journal special issue dedicated to the MWE research, following the MWE Special Issue of the Journal of Computer Speech and Language (19:4) published in 2005. In this issue, we present a set of papers that reflect the recent advances and achievements in the MWE research area. These papers address several issues, including MWE identification and extraction, analysis and representation, and involve eight languages: English, Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Estonian, Portuguese and Czech.
 Among the papers, two address MWE based on bilingual corpus resources. Caseli et al. propose an approach to MWE identification in a multilingual context (English and Portuguese) as a by-product of word alignment. Their approach can also associate multiword expressions with semantics, and facilitate and speed up lexicographic work. Morin and Daille define a framework for lexical alignment of multi-word terms (MWTs) in French-Japanese comparable corpora, which involves a compositional translation process and the lexical context analysis. Their experiment showed a significant improvement for the translation of MWTs.

Next, three of the papers address the issue of MWE identification and extraction from monolingual corpora. Kim and Baldwin propose a method for automatically identifying English verb particle constructions (VPCs) in raw text, by employing the RASP parser and analysing the sentential context of each VPC candidate. Their method achieved an F -score of 0.974 at VPC identification over the Brown and Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank corpus. Pecina reports an evaluation of a set of lexical association measures and their combinations for collocation extraction based on the Prague Dependency Treebank and the Czech National Corpus. Strik et al. investigate the possible ways of automatically identifying Dutch MWEs in speech corpora. Their analyses revealed that the Dutch MWEs display extreme pronunciation variation and reduction, and the best results were obtained by using a metric that combines overall pronunciation reduction with weighted frequency.
Two other papers address the issue of lexical representation of MWEs in a lexicon and a syntactic tree bank. Gregoire X  X  paper discusses the design and implementation of a Dutch Electronic Lexicon of Multiword Expressions (DuELME), which contains over 5,000 Dutch multiword expressions. In particular, the author discusses their standard lexical representation based on the Equivalence Class Method (ECM), in which the selection of the lexical entries and their properties is corpus-based. The paper also presents the results of an evaluation of the standard representation in a Dutch dependency parser named Alpino. Bejc  X  ek and Stranak describe the annotation of multiword expressions in the Prague Dependency Treebank that involves several automatic pre-annotation steps. They use subtrees of the tree structures of the Prague dependency treebank to store representations of MWEs in the dictionary.

The penultimate paper, authored by Muischnek and Kaalep, investigates the variability of a subtype of Estonian MWEs that either consist of a verb and a particle or consist of a verb and its complement(s). They also analyse the behaviour of verbal MWEs, including opaque and transparent idioms, support verb constructions and particle verbs. They also further analyse the order of the MWE components, lexical substitution and morphosyntactic flexibility. Finally, Doucet and Ahonen-Myka present a method for measuring the similarity of MWE document identifiers and evaluate their technique in the context of document retrieval. Of particular note here, is that they deal with the problem of overlapping MWEs or phrases.

We are grateful for all the contributions and assistance given by the authors and reviewers. We believe that this special issue will help make the study of MWE a little less hard going and more plain sailing in the future.
