 We demonstrate SSNetViz that is developed for integrating, visu-alizing and querying heterogeneous semantic social networks ob-tained from multiple information sources. A semantic social net-work refers to a social network graph with multi-typed nodes and links. We demonstrate various innovative features of SSNetViz with social networks from three information sources covering a similar set of entities and relationships in terrorism domain.

The increasing popularity of social network platforms has given opportunities to capture and understand the social structures among people and other types of entities on the Web. Nevertheless, the same users or entities may appear in di ff erent social networks where di ff erent sets of attributes and relationships are maintained. This calls for a tool to combine these social networks and conduct anal-ysis on the combined network in a holistic manner.

SSNetViz o ff ers a suite of functions to: (i) integrate multiple so-cial networks through rule-based and manual matching approaches, (ii) visualize the integrated network with the ability of searching for a query relevant sub-network through entity name matching, free-text search of entity profiles, and path search, (iii) visualize the temporal evolution of the networks, and (iv) import / export the query relevant sub-network [2, 3]. The integration, free-text / path search and the sub-network import / export are the major features distinguishing our prototype from other similar systems [1, 4].
The main GUI of SSNetViz is shown in Figure 1. A query rel-evant sub-network can be defined based on the anchor nodes ( i.e., entities) selected by users in Panel 1, or node search results from Panel 4. The sub-network may also be determined from path search results which include all the intermediate nodes formulating the  X  This work was supported by Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, Project No. 062 101 0031.
