 Morphologically rich languages pose significant challenges for natural language processing. The ex-tensive use of inflection, derivation, and composi-tion leads to a huge vocabulary, and sparsity in mod-els estimated from data. Statistical machine transla-tion (SMT) systems estimated from parallel text are affected by this. This is particularly acute when ei-ther the source or the target language, or both, are morphologically complex.

Owing to these difficulties and to the natural in-terest researchers take in complex linguistic phe-nomena, many approaches to morphological anal-ysis have been developed and evaluated. We fo-cus on applications to SMT in Section 1.1, but we note the recent general survey (Roark and Sproat, 2007) and the Morpho Challenge competitive evalu-ers have focused on determining which analyzer was best suited for some particular task. For translation, we take a different approach and investigate whether competing analyzers might have complementary in-formation. Our method is straightforward. We train two identical SMT systems with two versions of the same parallel corpus, each with a different mor-phological decomposition of the source language. We combine their translation hypotheses perform-ing Minimum Bayes Risk decoding over merged N-best lists. Results are reported in the NIST 2008 Arabic-to-English MT task and an European Parlia-ment Finnish-to-English task, with significant gains over each individual system. 1.1 Prior Work Several earlier works investigate word segmenta-tion and transformation schemes, which may include Part-Of-Speech or other information, to alleviate the effect of morphological variation on translation models. With different training corpus sizes, they focus on translation into English from Arabic (Lee, 2004; Habash and Sadat, 2006; Zollmann et al., 2006), Czech (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005; Tal-bot and Osborne, 2006), German (Nie X en and Ney, 2004) or Catalan, Spanish and Serbian (Popovic and Ney, 2004). Some address the generation challenge when translating from English into Span-ish (Ueffing and Ney, 2003; de Gispert and Mari  X no, 2008). Unsupervised morphology learning is pro-posed as a language-independent solution to reduce the problems of rich morphology in (Virpioja et al., 2007). Factored models are introduced in (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) for better integration of morpho-syntactic information.

Gim  X enez and M`arquez (2005) merge mul-tiple word alignments obtained from several linguistically-tagged versions of a Spanish-English corpus, but only standard tokens are used in decod-ing. Dyer et al. (2008) report improvements from multiple Arabic segmentations in translation to En-glish translation, but their goal was to demonstrate the value of lattice-based translation. From a model-ing perspective their approach is unwieldy: multiple analyses of the parallel text collections are merged to create a large, heterogeneous training set; a sin-gle set of models and alignments is produced; lattice translation is then performed using a single system to translate all morphological analyses. We find that similar gains can be obtained much more easily.
The approach we take is Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) System Combination (Sim et al., 2007). N-best lists from multiple SMT systems are merged; the posterior distributions over the individual lists are interpolated to form a new distribution over the merged list. MBR hypotheses selection is then per-formed using sentence-level BLEU score (Kumar and Byrne, 2004). It is very likely that even greater gains can be achieved by more complicated combi-nation schemes (Rosti et al., 2007), although signif-icantly more effort in tuning would be required. For Arabic-to-English translation, we consider two alternative segmentations of the Arabic words. We first use the MADA toolkit (Habash and Rambow, 2005). After tagging, we split word prefixes and suf-fixes according to scheme  X  X 2 X  (Habash and Sadat, 2006). Secondly, we take the segmentation gener-ated by Sakhr Software in Egypt using their Arabic Morphological Tagger, as an alternative segmenta-tion into subword units. This scheme generates more tokens as it segments all Arabic articles which other-wise remain attached in the MADA D2 scheme (Ta-ble 1).
 Translation experiments are based on the NIST MT08 Arabic-to-English translation task, includ-ing all allowed parallel data as training material (  X  150M English words, and 153M or 178M Arabic words for MADA-segmented and Sakhr-segmented text, respectively). In addition to the MT08 set itself, we take the NIST MT02 through MT05 evaluation sets and divide them into a development set (odd-numbered sentences) and a test set (even-numbered sentences), each containing  X  2k sentences.

The SMT system used is HiFST , a hierarchical phrase-based system implemented with Weighted Finite-State Transducers (Iglesias et al., 2009). Two identical systems are trained from each parallel cor-pus, i.e. MADA-based and SAKHR-based. Both systems use the same standard features and share the first-pass English language model, a 4-gram es-timated over the parallel text and a 965 million word subset of monolingual data from the English Giga-word Third Edition. Minimum Error Training pa-rameter estimation under IBM BLEU is performed on the development set (mt02-05-tune), and the out-put translation lattice is rescored with large language models estimated using  X  4.7B words of English newswire text, in the same fashion as (Iglesias et al., 2009). Finally, the first 1000-best hypotheses are rescored with MBR, taking the negative sentence level BLEU score as the loss function to minimise.
For system combination, we obtain two sets of N-best lists of depth N=500, one from each system. Both lists are obtained after large-LM lattice rescor-ing, i.e. prior to individual MBR. A joint MBR de-coding is then carried out on the aggregated 1000-best list with equal weight assigned to the posterior distribution assigned to the hypotheses by each sys-tem. Results are shown in Table 2.

As shown, the scores obtained via MBR combi-nation outperform significantly those achieved via MBR for the best-performing system (MADA). The mixed case BLEU-4 for the MBR-combined system on mt08 is 44.1. This is directly comparable to the official MT08 Constrained Training Track evalua-Finnish is a highly-inflecting, agglutinative lan-guage. It has dozens of both inflectional and derivational suffixes, that are concatenated together with only moderately small changes in the sur-face forms. For instance, one can inflect the word  X  X auppa X  (shop) into  X  X aupa+ssa+mme+kin X  (also in our shop) by glueing the suffixes to the end. In addition, Finnish has many compound words, sometimes consisting of several parts, such as  X  X lko+maa+n+kauppa+politiikka X  (foreign trade policy). Due to these properties, the number of dif-ferent word forms that can be observed is enormous.
Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2007) is a method for modeling concatenative morphology in an un-supervised manner. It tries to find morpheme-like units, morphs, that are segments of the words. In-spired by the minimum description length principle, Morfessor tries to find a concise lexicon of morphs that can effectively code the words in the train-ing data. Unlike other unsupervised methods (e.g., Goldsmith (2001)), there is no restrictions on how many morphs a word can have. After training the model, the most likely segmentation of new words to morphs can be found using the Viterbi algorithm. There exist a few different versions of Morfessor. The baseline algorithm has been found to be very useful in automatic speech recognition of agglutina-tive languages (Kurimo et al., 2006). However, it often oversegments morphemes that are rare or not seen at all in the training data. Following the ap-proach in (Virpioja et al., 2007), we use the Morfes-sor Categories-MAP algorithm (Creutz and Lagus, 2005). It applies a hierarchical model with three sur-face categories (prefix, stem and suffix), that allow the algorithm to treat out-of-vocabulary words in a convenient manner. For instance, if we encounter a new name with a known suffix, it can usually sepa-rate the suffix and leave the actual name intact.
Similarly to the Arabic-to-English task, we train two identical HiFST systems. In this case, whereas one is trained on Finnish morphs decomposed by Morfessor (morph-based), the other is trained on standard, unprocessed Finnish (word-based). For this task we use the EuParl parallel corpus . Portions from Q4/2000 was reserved for testing and Septem-ber 2000 for development, both containing around 3,000 sentences. The training data comprised 23M English words, and 17M or 27M Finnish tokens for word-based or morph-based text, respectively.
The training set was also used to train the mor-phological segmentation. The quality of the seg-mentation is evaluated in (Virpioja et al., 2007). A precision of 78.72% and recall of 52.29% was mea-sured for the segmentation boundaries with respect to a linguistic reference segmentation. As the recall is not very high, the segmentation is more conserva-tive than the linguistic reference. Table 4 shows an example for a phrase in the training data.

Results are shown in Table 3, where again signifi-cant gains are achieved when simply combining out-put N-best lists via MBR. Only one reference was available for scoring. In this case we did not ap-ply large-LM rescoring, as no large additional par-liamentary data was available. Individual MBR did not yield gains for each of the systems. We demonstrated that multiple morphological anal-yses can be the basis for SMT system combination. These results will be of interest to researchers devel-oping morphological analyzers, as it provides a new, and potentially profitable way to evaluate compet-ing analysers. The results should also interest SMT researchers. SMT system combination is an active area of research, but good gains from combination usually require very different system architectures; this can be a barrier to developing competitive sys-tems. We find that the same architecture trained on two different analyses is adequate to generate the di-verse hypotheses needed for system combination.
