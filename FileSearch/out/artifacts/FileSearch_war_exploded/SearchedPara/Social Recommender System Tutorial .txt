 In recent years, with the proli feration of the social web, users are increasingly exposed to social overload and the designers of social web sites are challenged to attract and retain their user basis . Social recommender systems are becoming an integral part of virtually any leading web site, playing a key factor in its success: First, they aim to address th e overload problem by helping users to find relevant content. Second, they can provide recommendations for content creation , increasing participation and user retention. In this tutori al, we will review the broad domain of social recommender systems , their application for the social web , the underlying techniques and methodologies; the data in use, recommended entities, and target population; evaluation techniques; and open issues and c hallenges.

 Recommender systems ; social media ; social networks ; social web ; social recommender s ystems ; web 2.0 While the abundance and popularity of social media sites allow people to leave and share their own digital footprints, they overwhelm the users with mo untains of information and hence pose a great challenge for users to find relevant information. Social Recommender Systems aim to alleviate information overload by presenting the most attractive and relevant conten t, often using personalization techniques adapted for the specific user. At the same time, the proliferation of social web sites creates new challenges for user engagement and retention, as there is increased competition between social media sites . Social recommender systems can be leveraged to incentivize content creation and user engagement . http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2645710.2645778 studie d technologies in which people play a central role. Ido X  X  main area of research is social media, with special focus on social network mining and analysis and on recommender systems. He has published over 40 conference and journal papers, spanning the fields of Human-Computer Interaction, Information and Knowledge Management, and Data Mining. In recent years, Ido has been particularly active in the area of Social Recommender Systems, publishing key papers on people recommendation ([2], [14], [15]) social content recom mendation ([8], [16], [17], [18]) , and activity stream filtering [13]. He is co -chair of the Workshop on Social Recommender Systems (held at IUI 2010, CSCW 2011, UMAP 2012, and WWW 2013 -4), co -chair of the 2011, 2013, and 2014 workshop on Recommender Systems and the Social Web (all held at RecSys), and a guest editor of two ACM TIST special issues on Social Recomme nder Systems (2011 and 2013). Ido has also served as the program co-chair of the 2012 ACM conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2012).
