 Web services have been are announced as the next wave of Internet-based business applications that will dramatically change the use of the Internet[1]. Now Web Services are being instead of traditional service in many industries, especially in the travel industry. Tourists may get a satisfactory travel to use them one by one, however when it come to the question how to compose these services, they become puzzled. In this situation, a research group including author, is developing IPVita, which is short for the Intelligent Platform of Virtual Travel Agency. The aim of designing IPVita is to dynamically and intelligently organize the Web Services as a process, and then provide a satisfactory and complete travel service for the tourists. 
Nowadays, many trade or open organizes are dedicated to helping the travel industry Alliance(OTA)[1], Travel Technology Initiative(TTI)[2], UN/CEFACT[3]. At the same time, some research projects such as METEOR-S [4], iBOM[5] which have similar goal as IPVita are in developing and gain wonderful successes. Differently with these efforts, IPVita tries to provide some outstanding characters. Tourists and Services Providers can benefit from IPVita as follows: z Providers can register their services like publishing advertisements and can adjust 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Sec.2, IPVita and its overall architecture is introduced. In Sec.3, how IPVita X  X  running process is introduced. IPVita consists of four parts, namely Semantic Management Module, Meta Process Generation Module, Service Registry and Process Execution Module, as Fig1 follows. 
Semantic Management Module manages the ontology and the rule in IPVita, which is the semantic foundation of IPVita , in the form of friendly interface and convenient operation. 
Meta Process Generation Module is responsible for formalizing the requirements of tourists and creating Meta process[6] automatically. This module consists of two parts, Requirement Template Generator and Meta Process Generator . 
Service Registry manages the services X  registration information that the provider submits. Service Registry has three modules: Service Registration Module , Service Discovery Module and Service Evaluation Module . 
Process Execution Module binds the services into tour Meta process and transfers an Meta process to a real one, and then hands them over to the workflow engine. The Process Execution Module is composed of three parts, namely Travel Process Generator , Travel Line Shower and Travel Process Engine. There are three kinds of users in IPVita: travel experts, providers and tourists. Next the process will be introduced from the three different views. 
Firstly travel experts are invited to define travel ontology using Ontology Tool  X  with the helping of the platform experts and to define rules using the Rule Tool  X  .
Secondly Service Registration Module  X  generates registration template for each template is generated automatically according to meta service ontology. Service providers fill blank. Besides filling blank, providers can also describe their special characteristic of service. After being filled, the registration template becomes the service registration information and is saved in the service registry. 
Thirdly a requirement template is created by requirement template generator  X  automatically based on the meta service ontology. The requirement description of each meta service having been filled over is called a Requirement Description Class and all requirement description classes compose a Requirement Description Tree . Lastly Meta Process Generator  X  creates the Meta Process model using an Auto Generation Algorithm for Meta Process (MPGA) introduced behind. Then Travel Process Generator  X  matches actual services for meta services supported by Service Discovery Module  X  , and then generates a real travel process. Then Travel Lines execution, Service Evaluation Module  X  evaluates QoS information. In paper [7] we can see how to use QoS.
