 This poster presents research about how maps are used at an emergency service centre. It focus on emergency service operators X  work practices, how they use maps in order to find the address and communicate to others the location of incidents, such as traffic accidents and fires. We analyse how the operators juxtapose the physical paper map with the computerised counterpart. When designing new technology there is a need to take juxtaposition into account.

When developing technologies in order to support work practices paper is often thought of as being old, inefficient and expensive due to interactional shortcomings compared with digital technologies. An understanding of how it is used can inspire design of new technology, especially when considering what role paper can play when interacting with computers. In this poster we look into a very specific use of paper in combination with digital technologies, namely paper and computerised maps in emergency service centres. Our study follows the traditions of workplace studies, i.e. we want to unpack work practices by looking closely at what people actually do. Our analytical interest is what they need to know in order to do their work. There are several studies of control room settings that raise issues about how maps are used [1-3]. The contribution of the research presented in this poster is that it looks into a specific case, the map usage at the Swedish emergency service centre. We argue that an understanding of the operators X  practices and juxtaposition of artefacts can nourish innovation of new artefacts, alternative interfaces and increased points-of-interaction. Over a period of about five years we have carried out three projects in the emergency service centres. Findings from the same project has been published elsewhere [4]. Each project has consisted of an ethnographic study followed by a design phase. The research presented in this poster is based on cases observed during the third project, although the analysis is based on all three studies. In this project we conducted a field study that lasted for a month at three centres of different size. We visited the largest centre for a total period of seven days, and spent three days at the smallest centre and one day at the medium sized centre. We tried to cover as many cooperation works differently depending of if it is daytime or night time. In the centres there are maps in different formats, scale, and granularity available on different media. There are mainly two different kinds of maps X  X  rescue map and a computerised map. The rescue map is made of paper and placed in the ceiling. At one of the emergency centres the operators themselves had put together maps of different levels of detail, i.e. maps of a local military practice field and road maps giving an overview of hospitals that could be used by the ambulance helicopters. The computerised map is based on the rescue map. Today it is run on a personal computer with a screen and has a separate keyboard. It is placed next to the computer aided dispatch system terminal. It includes maps in different scales, and covers the whole of Sweden. The operators can see the location on the map by sending the address information from the incoming call to the computerized map. The address database is another artefact that is often used by the operators. By using the telephone number, the address of the subscriber can be retrieved from the database. The address information may also be shown on the computerised map as a red dot, and in some cases also transferred to the ambulance and rescue service units. The following example illustrates how the operators juxtapose the use of the computerised map and the rescue map. The operator Lisa answers a call to the emergency line 112. The call is about a man who has been found unconscious in his home by the home help service. Lisa asks what has happened and after that she asks for address information and phone number. She sends a listening-in request, which is answered by the operator Klara right next to Lisa X  X . Lisa zooms in the locality on the computerized map. She calls the number that she got from the person who made the initial call. After that she looks through the medical index and gives advice. In parallel Klara is dispatching the rescue service and the helicopter. The status report has gone into deadlock at Lisa X  X  terminal, which means that she cannot get an updated view of the dispatched unit. Klara tells her that it is visible on her computerized map. Soon after that the change is visible at Lisa X  X  terminal too. Klara contacts the coordinates for the address against the rescue map that is mounted on the ceiling behind them. She pulls down the map and makes a comparison of the coordinates from the computerized map against the rescue map. Soon after that Lisa gives the helicopter exact coordinates. Of special interest we find how Klara uses the computerised map in combination with the paper map. It is interesting since it shows that the maps are used together for different purposes. The rescue map has some information that is not available at the computerised map. In the specific centre, the rescue map is annotated with information about flying times for helicopters. They have two helicopters, which both have different timetables. The fact that maps and medical indexes are being used is visible to other operators in the traffic room. One reason for this is that the computerised map can be used when doing searches for names and coordinates, and that the location and status of emergency units shows at that map. The rescue map, on the other hand, is larger, persistent and provides a better overview. One of our findings from the research about how maps are used at the emergency service centres is that the use of the computerised map does not exclude using the paper maps. Below three design issues regarding maps that are identified based on the ethnographic study are presented. augment the rescue maps with digital functionality. When doing this we need to take the cooperative aspects of the map usage into account. Today the rescue maps are pl aced in the ceiling, and pulled down when being used. They are not used all the time, but for example when solving ambiguities about location. By adding digital properties to the rescue map it becomes possible to use it more deliberately for collaboration, not just by keeping the visibility but also by supporting the actual work. The second issue is a need to consider how we may interconnect the maps, so that tasks done on one map, for example on the wall, are There is also a need to investigate how to interconnect the maps with the cases. For example by pointing at the map, the rescue-zone could be sent to the case file. The third issue is about juxtaposition. Today the operators use the different maps and juxtapose them in order to solve the problem at hand. The usage of shared artefacts in the emergency service centre are visible for colleagues, which supports other operators when following what is going on in the centre. When designing new technology for the emergency service centre, as well as for other settings, the practices of juxtaposition is something that can inspire new designs. People need to be able to juxtapose information, and the design should not constrain this possibility. We can open up for the possibility to juxtapose artefacts, by for example allowing information to be shown at different places in different forms. Location of accidents and other incidents are important aspects for emergency service work, and information about locations needs to be communicated within the centres, between the centres as well as to other parties. Often it is hard for callers to describe their position, and the emergency service operators have certain practices for determining the location. Our study shows how the operators juxtapose the different kind of maps, in order to make the location observable and sharable. This work involves determining the location on the map and getting the corresponding rescue zone. When communicating the address, both the street address and sometimes the coordinates are used. This information is available in different resources, which are juxtaposed in the course of handling the cases. Rather than conserving the practices of using paper maps and computerised counterparts we would find it intriguing to combine the functions and properties. The computerised map in the centres has not meant exclusion of the use of paper maps. That is, the operators use both kinds of maps frequently. The maps complement each other when solving ambiguities a bout location, and figuring out where events have happened. The operators use the maps that are most efficient for their purposes. The artefacts made of paper are not used just because they are made of paper X  X ut because they s upport the work. There are many opportunities for innovation in order to support the operators' practices using maps. By using technology such as digital pens, paper, touch screens, sensors, we can provide interaction points beyond the desktop X  X hich better suits the current work practices. When designing technology for pervasive computing environments it is important to take into consideration how artefacts are used together in the work practice today. We need to take juxtaposition into account. [1] Cohen, P.R. and D.R. McGee, Tangible Multimodal Interfaces [2] Garbis, C., The Collaboration Production and Use of Cognitive [3] Martin, D., J.
