 1. Introduction
Unmanned Maritime Vehicles (UMVs) are any marine surface or underwater vehicle that does not have, because it does not need, an on-board crew. They include remotely operated marine robots as well as autonomous ones. They are distinguished from the general unmanned vehicles on the basis that UMVs are robots that only operate in water but not in other domains. This context variety entails different behaviors, limitations, requirements, con-straints, etc. which demand some speci fi c capabilities, e.g. the domain impacts on the interaction among vehicles; in addition to the fact that ground vehicles are typically wheeled-traction and maritime vehicles are thruster-propelled, underwater domain has more limited communication capacities because of the water than the ground ones. Thus, autonomous vehicle capabilities can vary in nature which makes dif fi cult to implement same metrics and assessment criteria from one domain to other.

New generations of UMVs are getting progressively sophisti-cated by increasing their autonomous capabilities that allow them to deal with more and more complex missions. In spite of the fact that undersea autonomy is a key system requirement in UMVs, there is still not a common agreement on the aspects that should be considered to know whether UMVs satisfy the autonomy expected. Well-de fi ned metrics and assessment criteria are essen-tial to know what and how has to be assessed to determine how autonomous a UMV is or how much autonomy a UMV has. The challenge is to know what has to be measured from a UMV, and what metrics should be applied (based on the above measures) to determine its autonomy by means of assessment criteria.
The motivation to measure autonomy in UMVs is that their autonomous capabilities can be  X  quanti fi ed  X  so UMVs can be compared with each other based on a common set of assessment criteria for maritime autonomy. This becomes important in cases such as select-ing a UMV or a group of them for a particular sea or ocean mission, specifying what autonomy is expected for development or operation of UMV(s), or identifying weaker and stronger architectures and designs of maritime autonomy. Ultimately, it is useful to study suitability of UMVs for different missions assigned, and provide the ocean engineering community with a  X  common language  X  to deal with UMV capabilities as well as a measurement of the UMV autonomy is useful to analyze social, legal and ethical issues ( Autonomous Systems: Social, Legal and Ethical Issues, 2009 ).
The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) a review of current approaches to assess autonomous behavior in unmanned vehicles by recapping the different development and operation aspects taken into account to evaluate autonomy in unmanned systems from diverse domains, and (2) a study to devise guidelines for an assessment methodology for maritime autonomy by taking into account the about survey.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the background for this research work by reviewing and de relevant concept for the assessment process. Section 3 studies the measurable capabilities considered by current research works for autonomy assessment, and shows a classi fi cation of existing autonomy levels. Section 4 discusses aspects that should be considered when assessing UMVs. The last section is devoted to the conclusions, and future direction for this research. 2. Lexicon for autonomy assessment
This section presents a description of some concepts and de fi nitions that are relevant in the discussion so autonomy and its assessment can be considered in more detail. 2.1. Robotics terminology
The relevant robotics terminology for this paper involves the following terms:
Capability is the ability of a system to show behaviors based on actions taken within a context given by the system environment, users, and other systems.

Automation is the ability of a system to automatically carry out processes or perform actions. It is generally accepted that an automated system is one that does not make choices for itself, but follows a script in which the choice out of all possible courses of action has already been made. If the system encounters an unplanned-for situation, it stops and waits for human help. Thus for an automated system, choices have either already been made or encoded, or they must be made externally.

Autonomy is the ability of a system to govern itself by making decision, implementing the choice made, and checking the evolu-tion of such actions taken. An autonomous system, however, does make choices on its own. It tries to accomplish its objectives locally, without human intervention, even when encountering uncertainty or unanticipated events. However, autonomous sys-tems do have an automatic and automated decision-making process. Autonomy in the context of autonomous robotics is de fi ned as the ability of a system to make choices, enforce its decisions by applying actions, and evaluate results of such actions.
Intelligence is de fi ned as the ability to determine what beha-vior will maximize the likelihood of satisfying a goal in dynamic and uncertain environments ( Gunderson and Gunderson, 2004 ).
This section recaps the concept (adopted in this paper) of intelli-gence in robotics since the literature review of this paper involves intelligent systems.

The term intelligence is included in the robotics terminology to distinct between autonomy and intelligence but the latter is out of scope of this paper. 2.2. Metrics de fi nitions The main metrics de fi nitions in this paper are as follows:
Degree of Autonomy (DoA) is a numeric value (real number) given by autonomy metrics that quantitatively speci fi es how much autonomy a system has. It can be determined based on the autonomous capabilities of the system under study.

Level of Autonomy (LoA) is a numeric value (natural number) given by a scale (table) that speci fi es the grade of autonomy provided by a system at different levels. The LoA-based scale represents autonomy-assessment criteria that are applied to the
DoA to determine to what benchmark grade autonomous capabil-ities belong to.

The de fi nition and speci fi cation of an assessment process for autonomy involves the good understanding of what is intended to be evaluated. Autonomy is considered to be a non-functional requirement which is strongly linked to the system usability where the human operator is removed from the control loop.
Maritime autonomy is a quality factor to be assessed in this research work. Autonomy is a non-functional system requirement that can be quantitatively measured by the DoA of UMVs. This quantitative measurement makes sense when it undergoes the assessment criteria de fi ned as LoA. 2.3. Classi fi cation of autonomy
There are two types of autonomies: passive autonomy, and active autonomy.

Passive autonomy involves a capability-based assessment process, and determines what a UMV is potentially able to do autonomously by manufacture without taking into account any assignment (mission with goals). The passive DoA determines the potential autonomy of the UMV whilst the active DoA determines the in-operation autonomy of the UMV. The passive DoA follows the direction established for the measurement methods proposed by other researchers as mentioned in Section 3 .

Active autonomy involves a goal-based assessment process, and determines what a UMV is potentially able to do autono-mously once assignments (mission with goals) are given. There-fore, the classi fi cation of autonomy in passive and active autonomy leads to the evaluation of two different DoAs and LoAs. The active
DoA follows the direction established for adjustable autonomy where the LoA is variable according to the assignment given.
This research work considers differently the autonomy a UMV can have by nature (innate autonomous behavior as manufactured, i.e. static or by-design autonomy; so called passive autonomy), and the autonomy it can provide once a mission is assigned (adjustable autonomy, also dynamic or operational autonomy; so called active autonomy). 3. Measurable capabilities for autonomy assessment
Several approaches have been proposed to assess autonomous behaviors in unmanned vehicles. This section recaps various viewpoints adopted by researchers, and identi fi es the system capabilities they have taken into account to assess autonomy (DoA) in such systems. 3.1. Current approaches to assess autonomy
The literature review in this section is driven by assessment perspectives and system capabilities proposed by the following relevant approaches.

An autonomy classi fi cation based on the context in which agents (autonomous entities) interact. An approach is proposed as to environment , agent interaction , agent organization , system user , and internal agent in an attempt to classify different autonomies in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) ( Carabelea et al., 2004 ). The proposed classi fi cation de fi ned the main aspects of the perspectives to autonomy assessment.

The performance measures framework for unmanned systems (PerMFUS) ( Huang et al., 2009 ), based on ALFUS ( Huang et al., 2005 ), proposes a tree-aspect approach to evaluate the perfor-mance in unmanned systems. The main aspects are missions , environment ,and systems . They correspond to mission complexity, environmental complexity, and human independence or operator independence or autonomy level respectively in ALFUS.
A generic framework for performance metrics based on differ-ent system capabilities ( Lewis and Weiss, 2005 ). The autonomy degree of unmanned vehicles is speci fi ed according to the operational and functional system capabilities as to the ability of such systems to survive in the world.

A broader consideration for autonomy assessment is proposed at an entrepreneurial level by covering two system develop-ment aspects such as Autonomous Test and Evaluation (ATE), and ATE Enterprise (ATEE) ( Ring, 2009 ). This approach addresses a wider viewpoint than the three above perspective approaches by taking into account development and business issues of autonomous systems.

Following the above perspectives and taking them as founda-tions, a classi fi cation of the existing assessment frameworks can be done based on the different perspective dimensions, and the autonomy provided from the capabilities of systems.

Table 1 shows a classi fi cation of the current autonomy assess-ment frameworks based on the above approaches. Twenty four research works are the most representative of the state of the art.
Each refereed approach listed in the table shows what system capability is considered, and what perspective dimension is taken to evaluate it. Some approaches ( Ring, 2009 ) make a categoriza-tion of the levels of autonomy for each system capability.
Table 1 groups related concerns from researchers that assess autonomy. They take into account similar perspectives by using different but equivalent names as follows. 3.1.1. Organization
Autonomy, by nature, introduces a degree of non-determinism in the system behavior since the response is not known a priori.
Social laws, conventions, and organizational structures can be used to restrain autonomy in systems. This perspective observes autonomy in systems with respect to a norm ( Carabelea et al., 2004 ). The degree of autonomy (from this perspective) is a function of the state of the technology, the degree of system reliability, and the conditions in which the unmanned vehicle must operate related to national policy considerations ( Finn and Scheding, 2010 ). 3.1.2. User
A system is autonomous with respect to the user for choosing what actions to perform if it can make the choice without the user intervention. This is known as adjustable autonomy ( Carabelea et al., 2004 ). ALFUS de fi nes human interface as an evaluation perspective for autonomous systems performance. It includes autonomy regarding frequency, duration, robot initiation, work-load, skills, and operator to autonomous systems ratio ( Huang et al., 2005 ). The user is considered a functional area ( Huang et al., 2009 ). 3.1.3. Interaction
Also socialization; it is possible to say a system is autonomous with respect to another system for the adoption of a goal if it can refuse that goal from the other. The interaction or social autonomy goes from autistic to benevolent systems ( Carabelea et al., 2004 ). A key point in this perspective is to explore how the external physical/logical properties of an autonomous system contribute or affect its performance. The user is also included in the systems aspect ( Huang et al., 2009 ).
 3.1.4. Environment
The environment can only in fl uence the behavior of an auton-omous system but not imposes it ( Carabelea et al., 2004 ). ALFUS de fi nes environmental dif fi culty as an evaluation perspective for autonomous-systems performance. It includes autonomy regard-ing terrain, soil, object frequency/density/types, urban, rural, weather, threats, decoy, and mapping ( Huang et al., 2005 ). This perspective characterizes operating environments and determines how they might affect the autonomous system's performance ( Huang et al., 2009 ). 3.1.5. Intra-action
Also self-or agent autonomy is the property of an autonomous system to have and choose between several possible behaviors ( Carabelea et al., 2004 ). A key point in this perspective is to explore how the internal physical/logical properties of an auton-omous system contribute or affect its performance. The user is also included in the systems aspect ( Huang et al., 2009 ). 3.1.6. Mission Autonomous systems carry out missions to achieve their goals.
Therefore, a key perspective is the mission one to evaluate whether and how well the goals are achieved ( Huang et al., 2009 ). ALFUS de fi nes mission complexity as an evaluation per-spective for autonomous systems performance. It includes auton-omy regarding subtasks, decisions, commanding structure, interfaces, planning, allowed latencies, and situation awareness ( Huang et al., 2005 ). 3.1.7. Development
This includes design and evaluation. The levels of autonomy are requirements for the design process ( Proud et al., 2003 ). Parsi-mony factors such as budgets constraints are considered by the test and evaluation community. Parsimony in the sense that no other system exhibits required quality at less cost of ownership.
The autonomy of the tests on autonomous systems must include the capability of persistent viability assurance. This perspective comes from the Autonomous Test and Evaluation (ATE) of systems ( Lewis and Weiss, 2005 ). 3.1.8. Enterprise
Autonomous Test and Evaluation Enterprise (ATEE) are com-mitted to deliver autonomous systems that comply with the stakeholder requirements. Key capabilities are goals, triggers, energy, competence, situation assessment, and gap closure ( Lewis and Weiss, 2005 ). Metrics at this level include accuracy in achieving mutual purpose, response time to external and internal changes, and dynamic limits with respect to rate of change.
Parsimony metrics are costs to achieve the goal, and the cost of disergy.

The above surveyed research works take into account similar system capabilities (to be evaluated to assess autonomy) by using different but equivalent names as follows. 3.1.9. Motion
The capability of utilizing movement. It is also called  X  2004 ), and  X  Act  X  ( Ring, 2009 ). Manipulation is also including in this category ( Huang et al., 2009 ). 3.1.10. Acquisition The ability to gather, store, and utilize energy ( Hasslacher and
Tilden, 1995 ). 3.1.11. Protection
The capability to defend oneself ( Hasslacher and Tilden, 1995 ). 3.1.12. Problem-solving
The capability of task planning ( Carabelea et al., 2004 ), and analysis/decision-making, and decision are considered ( Ring, 2009 ). 3.1.13. Communication
This includes cooperation, coordination, interaction, and colla-boration. Communication/cooperation is taken into account ( Ring 2009 ). 3.1.14. Perception
Situational awareness is considered ( Carabelea et al., 2004 ), and observation and orientation ( Ring, 2009 ) are considered in this category. 3.2. Categorization of the measurement approaches
A categorization of the existing measurement approaches makes it possible to draw a picture of the distribution of view-points from different researchers. This shows what they are most interested in when evaluating autonomy in different areas.
Fig. 1 shows how the researchers' perspectives are distributed according to the assessment framework approaches they propose.
The mission and intra-action perspectives are the most considered ones, and the ATE and ATEE are the least considered ones (development and enterprise). The internal autonomy (intra-action) is the most evaluated by researchers. This makes sense since it is about the internal behavior of the vehicles that is re fl ected externally. Then, it is followed by the goal-autonomy (mission), and the social-autonomy (interaction).

Fig. 2 shows how the system capabilities studied by researchers are distributed according to the assessment framework approaches they propose. The problem-solving, motion, and per-ception capabilities are the most considered ones, and the protec-tion is the least considered one. The problem-solving is the most evaluated by researchers. This makes sense since it is the key capability of the autonomy. Then, it is followed by the motion, and the perception capabilities.

Fig. 3 presents how the assessment frameworks and processes studied (24 research works) are distributed according to the application domain they are used for. General propose approaches could be included in the multi-domain group; the difference between them is that the former does not address any particular domain while the latter propose methodologies for agents that can be deployed in any application domain.
 3.3. Classi fi cation of autonomy levels
Autonomy is a characteristic of unmanned systems that has a continuous spectrum de fi ned by a range of DoA values. However, researchers and practitioners looking for a way to understand what a given DoA means have speci fi ed well-established levels (LoA).

Early attempts to de fi ne the LoA for unmanned systems mainly came from contributions by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) ( Hasslacher and Tilden, 1995 ), Draper Laboratory (DL) ( Cleary et al., 2000 ), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) ( Clough, 2002 ), and National Aeronautics and Space Administra-tion (NASA) ( Proud et al., 2003 ).There is also a particular approach from the US Army (UA) that is taken into account by the US Navy for autonomous vehicles in support of naval operations ( Naval
Studies Board (NSB), 2005 ). Collectively, they are a useful starting point for attempts at generalization.

Table 2 summarizes the key characteristics of these main existing autonomy-assessment criteria for unmanned systems.
The numbers of levels they take into account are different but the ranges of degree of autonomy are the same. The ability measures vary from one approach to other but all of them address the three basic computational elements: sensing, processing (including communicating), and actuating.

Table 3 presents an expanded version of the above approaches by detailing the levels of autonomy that are considered by each of them.

Levels of autonomy do not have a general name or description in the Mobility Acquisition Protection (MAP) and 3D Intelligence
Space (3DIS) approaches. An  X  X  X  in the cell means that level is presented in the approach but has no name. The  X   X  fi nal LoA considered by the MAP approach means that only external events can contribute to the autonomy. Empty cells means the level is not considered in the approach. Even though the different approaches have the same LoA considered, it does not mean the DoA is the same. For instance, level  X  0  X  in the initial and fi nal ACL matches  X  0  X  of the initial and fi nal ACL, and so on. 4. Metric assessment for maritime autonomy
This section discusses aspects of the autonomy-assessment process for UMVs in order to devise considerations for metrics and assessment criteria. 4.1. Existing metrics and assessment criteria for maritime autonomy
Current metrics and assessment criteria for maritime autonomy focus on underwater operations with a main concern on power consumption, e.g. oceanographic surveys. The ASTM-F2541 stan-dard ( American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), 2006 ) for autonomy and control of autonomous underwater vehicles proposes three assessment criteria for the autonomous capabilities based on the different aspects of the deliberative robotic layer, i.e. situation awareness, decision-making, planning and control, and external interaction. The US Navy implements the LoA de fi the US Army (UA) for future combat systems to autonomous vehicles that support naval operations ( Naval Studies Board (NSB), 2005 ). It has a 10-level LoA, and assesses the following capabilities: observation, perception, situation of awareness, deci-sion-making, and capabilities.

Only 19% (nine perspective-capability metrics) of the full perspective-capability metrics studied in Section 3 (eight perspec-tives and six capabilities equivalent to 48 perspective-capability metrics) is considered in current assessment approaches for maritime autonomy. An important number of perspectives and some maritime capabilities are not assessed. However, there are other approaches from different domains such those autonomy metrics (four perspective-capability metrics) that initially are proposed for spacecraft can be applied to marine systems. Now, 27% (nine  X  four perspective-capability metrics) of the full perspective-capability is taken into account but even so there are some important perspective-capability metrics that should be considered, e.g. from the organization's perspective (in particular for multiple UMVs). This clearly means that there is a lack of methodologies to assess autonomy in the maritime domain. Additionally, they do not measure autonomy but UMV performance.
 4.2. Autonomy thinking
There are some questions on the autonomy measures for UMVs to be discussed as follows. 4.2.1. Different perspectives for autonomy assessment
It is clear that a multi-perspective autonomy approach follows the philosophical mind-set  X  divide and defeat  X  in order to simplify the autonomy assessment. Nowadays, UMVs have more autono-mous capabilities which enable them to make decisions and interact with different context elements, e.g. a UMV can have autonomy with respect to the user for certain operations but it can need assistance to make decisions regarding the environment.
Thus, an autonomy classi fi cation according to perspectives is good to study such a capability by considering individually various interacting elements but is not a compressive autonomy assessment. 4.2.2. LoA in passive autonomy
There are two stages in the UMV life cycle where autonomy is assessed: the development and the operation. Passive autonomy is a requirement for UMV development but also it is part of quality criteria. The way to satisfy criteria is by means of metrics.
Autonomy requirements can be veri fi ed (also validation) through a metric assessment. Therefore, passive autonomy is important to know and con fi rm whether the UMV under development satis the autonomy requirements.
 4.2.3. Autonomy requirement dependency
If the passive autonomy of UMVs depends on the application domain, i.e. maritime domain, then any autonomous behavior is constrained and limited by the surface or underwater operations from UMV missions. Thus, maritime autonomy is subjected to what ocean/sea tasks (e.g. diving) have to be carried out, and therefore its autonomy requirements depend on them. Other dependencies can be proved as well, e.g. missions and goals. 4.2.4. Goal/action-dependent DoA
If the DoA does not depend on the goals, then it is possible to predict what the UMV could do but there is no objective refer-ences to compare it with. If it does, then it is possible to have a more accurate prediction on whether or not the UMV is able to deal with the goals given. On the other hand, if the DoA does not depend on the actions and some action policies (constraints and commitments given), then there is a risk (i.e. the UMV can perform actions that are basically critical for safety and security). Thus, even though there is a solution for the problem (mission), the collateral effects could be worse than the problem. If it does, then it is possible the UMV cannot fi nd a solution because of restric-tions on its actions. Nevertheless, it does not mean it has less autonomy but intelligence. 4.3. Autonomous decision-making for problem-solving
The autonomy performance does not affect the LoA. All the approaches studied in this paper ( Section 3 ) measure autonomy based on the system performance, e.g. a UMV could have a high
DoA because it carries out a underwater pipeline inspection successfully by following pre-planned actions ( fi xed list of actions). However, the UMV could be not successful if an unex-pected event occurs and it has to make a decision on what to do to deal with such a situation but the UMV is not able to make it.
These performance-based approaches basically measure the qual-ity of services but not the ability to make choices, implement actions, and evaluate results of executing such actions (autonomy de fi nition in Section 2.1 ) as proposed in this paper.
An assessment process for maritime autonomy has to assess the decision-making capability, the enforcement capability to make the actions happen, and evaluation capability to check the evolution of the action taken. The Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) loop ( McIntosch, 2011 ) is able to deal with the above two fi rst capabilities, i.e.  X  Observe  X  ,  X  Orient  X  , and spond to the decision-making process, and  X  Act  X  corresponds to the enforcement process. The evaluation capability is not considered by the OODA. The problem-solving process is a decision-making process plus  X  Act  X  plus  X  Evaluate  X  , i.e. OODA plus  X  (OODAE). However, the Analysis Plan Implement Evaluate (APIE) takes into account such capability.

Fig. 4 shows the decision-making process as part of the problem-solving one. It corresponds to the three fi rst stages. Both can be mapped on the OODA loop as well as the APIE loop.
According the autonomy assessment approach devised in the paper, the level of automation of each of the above OODAE stage determines the overall autonomy of the UMV. The information about the OODAE capabilities of the UMV under study can be collected by means of a description of the autonomous UMV capabilities and automation for each OODAE stage in order to calculate the DoA for each perspective. 4.4. Assessment process for maritime autonomy
Fig. 5 shows the main steps that the proposed method for assessment of UMV autonomy should have.

The process should have the following steps: 1. Speci fi cation of the levels of automation for each OODAE cap-ability with respect to each perspective. There are different ways to obtain these numbers, e.g. to de fi ne standard OODAE capabilities for UMVs, and compare them with those from the
UMV under study. 2. Calculation of the Degree of Autonomy (DoA) for each perspec-tive (this is the UMV autonomy with respect to each perspec-tive) based on results from step 1. The DoA computing can be done by different approaches, e.g. following the above exam-ple; how many standard OODAE capabilities the UMV under study has (percentage with respect to the total). 3. Obtaining of the Level of Autonomy (LoA) for each DoA. The DoAs obtained in step 2 are real numbers from 0.00 to 9.00 that are rounded off to natural numbers established (LoAs) by for the different perspectives ( Table 3 ). There are eight DoAs, therefore eight LoAs (one by each perspective). Knowing these LoAs, it is possible to draw an eight-dimensional graph as a picture to show the outcomes of a multidimensional autonomy assess-ment for UMVs. Thus, the outcome is not an only and general LoA but a set of LoAs.
 The requirements to realize the above process are De fi nition of standard OODAE capabilities for UMVs (step 1).
Speci fi cation of metric formulas to calculate DoAs for UMVs (step 2).

Speci fi cation of a natural scale (0  X  9) with the 10 LoAs for UMVs (step 3). 5. Conclusions
Different autonomy-assessment frameworks have been stu-died. In particular, the researchers' perspectives as well as system capabilities to analyze autonomy in unmanned vehicles have been reviewed from various application domains. The broad research has been carried out in order to consider current autonomy assessment processes as background to devise a metric autonomy framework for UMVs. This framework is useful to select an UMV or a group of them for a particular sea or ocean mission by specifying what DoA is expected for development or operation of UMV(s), or identifying weaker and stronger architectures and designs of maritime autonomy as well as to study suitability of UMVs for different missions assigned. The guidelines presented in this paper propose a metric assessment methodology that does not measure performance in autonomous UMVs. Instead, it measures the ability to automatically make decision, and potentially solve problems.
The justi fi cation to have a way to measure maritime autonomy is that the LoA scale is expected to be standard where anyone working with UMVs can use to compare autonomy from UMVs.
Future research work will include the implementation of a process for autonomous UMV behavior based on guidelines pre-sented for maritime autonomy metrics and assessment criteria.
The approach will take into account existing solutions as those presented in this paper for other domains (including maritime systems) as well as aspects as discussed in Section 4 to try to current gaps for assessing maritime autonomy.
