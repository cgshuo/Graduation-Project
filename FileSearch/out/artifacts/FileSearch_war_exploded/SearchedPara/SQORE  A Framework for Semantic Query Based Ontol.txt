 The Semantic Web aims to expand the World Wide Web by allowing data to be shared and reused across applications and communities via ontology [4]. However, existing ontology search engines primarily base their approaches on search terms which cannot sufficiently capture the structural and semantic information about the domain concepts that users want. Swoogle [6, 7] and OntoKhoj [9] implement the Google  X  X  PageRank -like algorithm [5] which creates the rankings based on ontology links among ontologies on the Web. OntoSearch [10] provides several criteria for users to evaluate and browse the ontologies and then uses AKTiveRank [1] as metrics for ontology ranking based on the taxonomic structure information such as class otherwise they require tremendous modification efforts. Furthermore, semantic equivalentClass , and subPropertyOf ) is not considered. 
This paper develops SQORE  X  Semantic Query based Ontology Retrieval framework which allows users to structurally and semantically formulate their ontology requirements in terms of semantic queries . It employs XML Declarative Description ( XDD ) theory [2, 3, 11] as its theoretical foundation for modeling ontology databases and evaluating semantic queries, which does not only facilitate ontology matching and retrieval, but also support reasoning capab ility to enhance the such as WordNet [8], for determining semantic relation between two given terms. when compared to a conventional keyword search. In addition, it employs similarity score to rank the resulting ontologies by focusi ng on their conceptual closeness to the formulated semantic query. 
Sect. 2 presents SQORE X  X  overview arch itecture. Sect. 3 describes ontology database modeling and its semantics. Sect. 4 develops an approach to semantic query formulation and evaluation. Sect. 5 concludes and draws future research directions. Fig. 1 illustrates SQORE X  X  system architecture which comprises four major components: i) a semantic query , ii) a retrieval engine , iii) an ontology database , and iv) a semantic lexical database . In essence, the system works as follows: First, a user formulates and submits a semantic query which precisely captures his/her ontology requirements. The system then executes such query by semantically evaluating it against the ontology database, which comprises a collection of ontologies and a set of rules defining ontology axiomatic semantics. By incorporating these rules, implicit hence enabling semantic query evaluation. Furthermore, when class/property names defined in a query and an ontology do not exactly match (=) , four possibilities occur: i) equivalence (  X  ) : the two terms are synonym, ii) more general (  X  ) : the query term is [8], is employed in order to determine their appropriate semantic relation. Finally, the system computes the semantic similarity score between a given query and an similarity), and returns as the answer the list of ranked ontologies. By employment of XDD theory, an ontology formalized in RDF(S) or OWL can readily and directly become an XDD description. In order to determine the meaning RDF(S)/OWL modeling construct is demanded. 
Fig. 2 gives an example of formalizing rdfs:subClassOf in terms of an XDD consequently, yields elements E 1  X  X  9 which are explicitly defined by O , together with for ontologies with PhDStudent modeled as a subClassOf Person , while Ontology O defines PhDStudent as a subClassOf Student which is then a subClassOf Person ; that in Ontology O , PhDStudent is also a subClassOf Person , and thus satisfying the query requirement. 
Founded on this formalism, an ontology database ODB becomes an XDD semantics of ontology modeling constructs. The database semantics, denoted by M ( ODB ), are the set of OWL elements describing classes, properties or instances collection ODB C plus those derivable from it via the axiomatic semantics ODB A . Definition 1 (Semantic Query). A semantic query is formulated as an XML element of the form: where  X  m  X  o  X  url gives a URL of a semantic lexical database,  X  w  X  semanticLexiconReference-and similarityWeightFactors-elements are optional. explicit specification of how important the mandatory conditions are, and hence 1 X  w M becomes the weight for the optional conditions. The semantic lexicon reference specifies external knowledge used for determining appropriate semantic relations between elements of Q and O . Thus, based on the discovered semantic relation between a query element t 1 and an ontology element t 2 defined as follows, the weight two elements are. In principle, it is recommended that 1 = w =  X  w  X   X  w  X   X  w  X   X  w  X  = 0. manually defined by a user. This section formally defines important similarity measures. First, let  X  be an ontology alphabet comprising ontology elements in the following sets:  X  C : Class names (such as Person , Student , PhDStudent ),  X  P : Property names (such as firstname , lastname , supervises , isSupervisedBy ),  X  D : Datatypes (such as xsd:string , xsd:nonNegativeInteger ),  X  M : Modeling constructs of RDF(S) and OWL (such as rdfs:subClassOf ),  X  R : Restrictions on classes and properties, having the form m ( a , b ) where m  X  M , The following definition first measures how well two ontology elements match. Definition 2 (Element Similarity Score: SS E ). The similarity of two ontology elements x and y is measured by: Based on this element similarity score definition, one can measure the similarity similarity score between x and each element y that is semantically defined by O . This is defined by: Definition 3 (Best Element Similarity Score: SS B ). The similarity between an element x  X  C  X  P  X  R and an ontology O  X  ODB is measured by: Next, the satisfaction scores of mandatory conditions ( SS M ) and of optional conditions ( SS O ) are defined. Definition 4 (Satisfaction Scores of Mandatory conditions: SS M and Optional mandatory conditions ( SS M ) and Q  X  X  optional conditions ( SS O ) are measured by: Finally, one can measure the similarity between a semantic query Q and an ontology O by integrating the two components: mandatory condition satisfaction score and optional condition satisfaction score, as follows: Definition 5 (Query-Ontology Similarity Score). The similarity between a semantic query Q and an ontology O is measured by: This paper proposes and develops SQORE  X  a novel framework for ontology retrieval system based on semantic query . It enables a user to precisely and structurally property names, but also their relations and restrictions. Moreover, when evaluating a query, its semantics together with an ontology X  X  semantics are also taken into account in order to correctly and semantically match them.
