 With the improved Web technology and increased Web popularity, users are commonly using online social networks to allow them to contact new friends or  X  X like X  users. Similarly, people from various different demographics have also increased the customer base of online dating networks [9]. It is reported [1] that there are around 8 million singles in Australia and 54.32% of them are using online dating services. Users of online dating services are overwhelmed by the number of choices returned by these servi ces. The process of selecting the right partner among a vast amount of candidates becomes tedious and nearly inef-fective if the automatic selection process i s not available. Therefore, a matching system, utilizing data mining to predict behaviors and attributes that could lead to successful matches, becomes a necessity.

Recommendation systems have existed for a long time to suggest users a prod-uct according to their web visit histories or based on the product selections of other similar users [2],[7]. In most cases, the recommendation is an item recom-mendation which is inanimate. On the contrary, the recommendation in dating networks is made about people who are animate. Different from item recommen-dation, people recommendation is a form of two way matching where a person can refuse an invitation but products cannot refuse to be sold. In other words, a product does not choose the buyer but dating service users can choose the dating candidates. The goal of an e-commerce recommendation system is to find prod-ucts most likely to interest a user, whereas, the goal of a social matching system is to find the user who is likely to respond favorable to them. Current recommen-dation systems cannot handle this well [6]. There are few published examples of recommendation systems applied explicitly to online dating. Authors in [4] use the traditional user-user algorithms and item-item algorithms with the use of user rating data for online dating recommendation, and failed to use many fac-tors, such as age, job, ethnicity, education etc that play important roles in match making. Authors in [6] proposed a theore tical generic reco mmendation algorithm for social networks that can easily be applied to an online dating context. Their system is based on a concept of social capital which combines direct similarity from static attributes, complementary relationship(s), general activity and the strength of relationship(s). However, this work is at a theoretical level and there have been no experiments carried out to prove the effectiveness of this theory. There are many weight factors in the proposed algorithm which may negatively influence it being an effective algorithm. Efficiency is another problem for these pairwise algorithms with a very high computation complexity.

This paper proposes a social matching system that combines the social net-work knowledge with content-based and collaborative filtering techniques [7] by utilizing users X  past relations and user similarities to improve recommendation quality. This system includes a nearest neighbour algorithm which provides the system an add-on layer to group similar users to deal with the cold-start prob-lem (i.e., handling new users). It also includes a relationship-based user similarity prediction algorithm which is applied to calculate similarity scores and generate candiadtes. Finally, a support vector machine [3] based algorithm is employed to find out the compatibility between the matching pairs. The similarity scores and the compatibility scores are combined to propose a ranked list of potential partners to the network users. The proposed system is evaluated on the dataset collected from a popular dating network. Empirical analysis shows that the pro-posed system is able to recommend the t op-N users with high accuracy. The recommendation success rate h as increased to 31% as compared to the baseline success rate of 19%. The baseline recall of the underlying dating network is also increased from 0.3% t o 9.2% respectively. Data required by a dating network for r ecommending potential partners can be divided into the following features: (1) Personal profile for each user which in-cludes self details on demographic; fixed-choice responses on Physical, Identity, Lifestyle, Career and Education, Politics and Religion and other attributes; free-text responses to various interests such as sport, music etc; and optionally, one or more photographs; (2) Ideal partner profile for each user which includes infor-mation about what user prefers in Ideal partner, usually the multiple choices on the attributes discussed before; (3) User activities on the network such as view-ing the profiles of other members, sending pre-typed messages to other users; sending emails or chat invitations; and (4) Measure of relationships with other users such as willingness to initialize relationships and responding to invita-tions, and frequency and intensity with which all relationships are maintained. A relationship is called successful for the purpose of match making when a user initiates a pre-typed message as a token of interest and the target user sends back a positive reply.

Let U be the set of m users in the network, U = u 1 ,...,u m .Let X be a user personal profile that includes a list of personal profile attributes, X = x 1 ,...,x n where each attribute x i is an item such as body type, dietary preferences, po-litical persuasion and so on. Consider the list of user X  X  ideal partner profile attributes as a set Y = y 1 ,...,y n where each attribute y i is an item such as body type, dietary preferences, polit ical persuasion and so on. For a user u j , value of x i is unary, however, the values of y i can be multiple. Let P = X + Y denote a user profile containing both the personal profile attributes and partner preference attribut es. The profile vector of a user is shown as P ( u j ). There can be many types of user activities in a network that can be used in the matching process. Some of the main activities are  X  X iewing profiles X ,  X  X nitiating and/or responding pre-defined messages (or kisses 1 ,  X  X ending and/or receiving emails X  and  X  X uying stamps X . The profile viewing is a one-sided interaction from the viewer perspective; therefore it is hard t o define the viewers X  interests. The  X  X iss interactions X  are more promising to be considered as an effective way to show the distinct interests between two potenti al matches. A user is able to show his/her interest by sending a  X  X iss X . The receiver i s able to ignore the  X  X iss X  received or return a positive or negative reply. Whe n a receiver replies a kiss with positive predefined message it is considered as a  X  X uccessful X  kiss or a  X  X ositive X  kiss. Otherwise, it is judged as an  X  X nsuccessful X  kiss or a  X  X egative X  kiss. Generation of Small Social Networks. A number of social networks which describe the past relations between user s and their previous contacted users, are derived. Let user u b be the user who has successfully interacted with more than a certain number of previous partners for a particular period. Let GrA be the set of users, GrA  X  U , who user u b has positively interacted. Let user u a be the user who user u b has positively interacted last, u a  X  GrA .Let GrB be the set of users who are ex-partners of user u a , u b  X  GrB . Note: gender( u b ) = gender( GrB ) and gender( u a ) = gender( GrA ). Users u b and u a are called seed users as they provide us the network. Users in GrA and GrB are called as relationship-based users. Th e relationship between user u b and a user in GrB , and the relationship between user u a and a user in GrA reflect the personal profile similarity between the two same gender users. This similarity value is evaluated by using an instance-based learning algorithm.

Figure 1 summarizes the proposed metho d. The process starts with selecting a number of seed pairs. A network of relationship-based users ( GrA, GrB )is generated by locating the ex-partn ers of the seed users. The size of GrA and GrB is increased by applying clustering to include new users and to overcome the lack of relationship based users f or a seed pair. The similarity between u b and users in GrB , and the similarity between u a and users in GrA are calculated to find  X  X loser X  members in terms of profile attributes. This step determines the users whose profiles match since they are the same gender users. Each pair in ( GrA, GrB ) is also checked for their compatibility using a two-way matching. These three similarity scores are combi ned by using weighted linear strategy. Finally, a ranked list of potential partner matches from GrB for each of GrA is formed.
 Personal Profile Similarity. An instance based learning algorithm is devel-oped to calculate similarity between th e seed user and the relationship-based users. Attributes in personal profile are of categorical domain. So an overlap function is used that determines how close the two users are in terms of at-tribute x i .
 where u 1 is a seed user and u 2  X  GrB or u 2  X  GrA . This matching process is conducted between a seed user u b and GrB users, as well as the corresponding partner seed user u a and GrA users. All attributes are not equally important when selecting a potential match [5],[8]. For example, analysis of dataset of a popular dating network 2 shows that attributes such as height, body type, and have children are specified more frequently than attributes such as nationality, industry and have pets in user personal profiles. Therefore, each attribute score is assigned with a weight when combined them all together. The weight is set according to the percentage that all members have indicated that attribute in their personal profiles exis ting in the network. Inclusion of the weight values according to the network statistic allo ws us to reflect the user interest in the network.
 Solving cold-start problem in the network. A recommendation system can suffer with cold-start problem [2] when in a network the number of relationship-based users is very low or new users are to be included in the matching process. This research utilizes the k-means clustering algorithm that helps to increase thesizeof GrA and GrB by finding similar users according to seed users u a and u b respectively. Users in the network f or a specified duration are grouped according to their personal profiles. Let C m = { C 1 ,...,C c } m be the cluster of male members of the network where c k is the centroid vector of cluster C m l .Let C f = C 1 ,...,C c f f be the cluster of female members of the network where c k is the centroid vector of cluster C f l . The user personal profile and preference attributes P = X + Y where X = { x 1 ,...,x n } and Y = { y 1 ,...,y n } are used in the clustering process. Appropriate clusters corresponding to gender of the seed users, u b and u a , are used to test which cluster matches best with the seed user such as ( max  X  ( c larity between a centroid vector and a us er profile vector. Cosine similarity is employed in the process. Members of the matched cluster are used in extending the size of GrA or GrB .
 The User Compatibility Algorithm. A recommendation system for social matching should consider two-way matching. For each personal attribute, the user X  X  preference is compar ed to the potential match X  X  stated value for the at-tribute. The result of the comparison is a single match score for that attribute that incorporates (1) the user X  X  preference for the match, (2) the potential match X  X  preference for the user, and (3) the importance of the attribute to both. The attribute cross score match can be thought of as a distance measure be-tween two users along a single dimension. The attribute cross match scores for all attributes are combined into a vector that indicates how closely the match is between a user and their potential match. The first step is to calculate the attribute cross match score CS x i ( u b ,u a ) that quantifies how closely a potential match fits the preferences of user u b based on profile attribute x i . That is, does a potential match X  X  stated value for an attribute fit the user X  X  preference y i for that attribute? If the user has explicitly stated a preference for the attribute then the measure becomes trivial. If the user has not explicitly stated a prefer-ence, then a preference can be inferred f rom the preferences of other members in the same age and gender group. Though a user may not explicitly state their preference, an assumption can be made tha t their preference is similar to others in the same age and gender group. The score then becomes the likelihood of a potential match up meets the preferences of a user u b for the attribute x i . where x i ( u b ) is the user u b  X  X  profile value for attribute x i and y i ( u b )isuser u  X  X  preferred match value for attribute x i . By the definition in above equation, scores range from 0 to 1. The attribute cross match score is moderated by a comparative measure of how important the attribute x i is to users within the same age and gender demographics of user u b . This measure, called the impor-tance, is estimated from the frequency of the users within the same age band and gender of the user that specify a preference for the attribute. This is done to ensure that all attributes are not equally important when selecting a potential match. Attributes such as height, body type, and have children are specified more frequently than attributes such as nationality, industry and have pets. If a user explicitly specifies a preference then it is assumed the attribute is highly important to them (e.g. when a user mak es an explicit religious preference). When it is not specified a good proxy for the importance of the attribute is the complement of the proportion of users in the same age and gender group who did specify a preference for the attribute. Mathematically, this is defined by By the definition in this equation, scores range from 0 to 1. The attribute score for x i between potential partners i s calculated as follows: Including the importance information upfront may simplify the task of training an optimisation model to map the attribute scores to a target variable. By reducing complexity of the model, accuracy may be improved. An alternative to the importance measure would be to leave the weightings for an optimisation model to estimate. It is assumed including the importance measure as part of the score calculations will assist training of the optimisation model.
Both the attribute match score and importance are also calculated from the perspective of the potential match X  X  up preference towards user u b . Finally, a single attribute match score M x i between two users for attribute x i is obtained as follows: By combining the four measures per attribute into one cross-match score per attribute the search space is reduced by three quarters.

Finding user compatibility requires a measurement that allows different po-tential matches to be compared. The measure should allow a user X  X  list of po-tential matches to be ranked in order of  X  closest X  matches. This is achieved by combining all attribute cross-matches scores into a singular match score. The goal then becomes to intelligently summarise the vector M ( u b ,u a )inaway that increases the score for matches that are likely to lead to a relationship. Technically, this becomes a search for an optimal mapping from a user u b to a potential match up based on their shared attribute cross-match vector M ( u b ,u a ) to a target variable that represents a good match. We will call this target variable the compatibility score Comp ( u b ,u a ) such that: An optimal mapping could be found by training a predictive data mining algo-rithm to learn the mapping function f provided a suitable target variable can be identified. Ideally the target relationship score would be a variable based on user activities that (1) identifies successful re lationships, and (2) increases the com-pany revenue through more contacts. In this research we have used the  X  X iss X  communication between user s as the target to learn the successful relationship. Calculation of the mapping function f from a potential match X  X  attribute cross-match vector to the compatibility score is performed using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm [3]. Each input to SVM is a real value ranging from -1 to 1. The trained SVM has a single real valued output that becomes the com-patibility score.
 Putting it all together. Once the three similarity scores, SimScore ( u b ,GrB j ) identifying profile similarity between the seed user and a potential match, SimScore ( u a ,GrA i ) identifying profile similarity between the seed partner and a recommendation object and Comp ( GrA i ,GrB j ) compatibility score between a potential match pair ( GrA i ,GrB j ) are obtained, these scores can be combined using weighted linear strategy.
 To determine these weights setting, a decision tree model was built using 300 unique seed users, 20 profile attributes and about 300,711 recommendations generated from the developed social matching system along with an indicator of their success. The resulting decision tree showed that higher percentage of positive kisses are produced when w 1  X  0 . 5and w 2  X  0 . 3and w 3  X  0 . 2. Therefore w , w 2 and w 3 are set as 0.5, 0.3 and 0.2 respectively. It is interesting to note the lower value of w 3 . It means that when two members are interested in each other, there exists high probability that both of them are similar to their ex-partners respectively.

For each recommendation object GrA i , matching partners are ranked accord-ingtotheir Match ( GrA i ,GrB j ) score and top-n partners from GrB become the potential match of GrA i . 3.1 Dataset: The Online Dating Network Theproposedmethodistestedwiththeda taset collected from a real life online dating network. There were about 2 million users in the network. We used the three months of data to generate and test networks of relationship-based users and recommendations. The activity and me asure of relationship between two users in this research is  X  X iss X . The number of positive kisses is used in testing the proposed social matching system. Figure 2 lists the details of the users and kisses in the network. A user who has logged on in the website during the chosen three months period is called as  X  X ctive X  user. The seed users and relationship based users come from this set of users. A kiss sender is called  X  X uccessful X  when the target user sends back a positive kiss reply. There are about 50 predefined messages (short-text up to 150 characters) used in the dating network. These kiss messages are manually defined as positive or negative showing the user interest towards another member. There are a large number of kisses exist in the network that have never been replied by t he target users and they are called as  X  X ull kiss X .
It can be noted that for each kiss sender, there is about 4 kiss replies (including successful and negative both) on an average. It can also be seen that about 75% kiss senders have received at least on e positive kiss reply. The amount of successful kisses is less than one fourth of the sum of negative and null kisses. A further kiss analysis shows a strong indication of Male members in the network for initiating the first activities such as sending kisses (78.9% vs 21.1%). They are defined as proactive behavior users in the paper. While female members who are reactive behaviour users u sually wait for receiving kisses. 3.2 Evaluation Criteria Let U be the set of network X  X  active users. Let GrA be the group of users who are going to receive potentia l partners X  reco mmendations and GrB be the group of users who become the potential partners. Let U = GrA GrB where GrA GrB =  X  . The recommendation performance is tested by whether the user has made initial contact to the users in the recommendation list. 3.3 Results and Discussion The SVM models were trained by changing different parameters on the datasets as shown in Figure 3. In the dataset, only a very small set of samples are positive matches. To avoid the model being overwhelmed by negative samples, a stratified training set was created. A set of at least 3500 unique users with about 20 positive and 20 negative kiss respons es per user were chosen. This created a sample training set of about 144,430 records which were used to train SVM models. The test dataset was created with 24498 records by randomly choosing users. A 10-fold cross validation experiments were performed and the average performance is shown in Figure 3. The best performing SVM model was used in the proposed matching system.

Figure 4 shows that the Success Rate (SR) decreases as the number of po-tential matches ( GrB ) is increased for a user in GrA . This result confirms that higher the total score generated by the proposed matching system, Match ( GrA i ,GrB j ), the more relevant and accurate ma tches are made. For example, users with higher total score in top-5 recommendation list recei ved highest percentage of positive kiss reply. There are a number of null kiss replies in the dataset. A null kiss reply can be transformed to positive kiss reply and negative kiss reply. If all the null kiss reply is able to transform to positive kiss reply, the success rate (SR) can be obtained as 66% for top-20 users. The BSR of the underly-ing online dating network is 19%. Figure 2 shows that the proposed system is always better. This result describes that the potential matches offered by the system interest the user (as shown by fi gure 5) and also the receivers show high interests towards these users by sending the positive kiss message back as shown by SR in figure 4 and with the increase d recall (figure 6). However, it can be seen that with the increased number of recommendations the value of SRI de-creases as shown in figure 5. It concludes that more matching recommendations will attract user attention and trigger more kisses to be sent. However, more recommendation will also lead to low q uality recommendati ons. When recom-mending potential matches, the user is more interested in examining a small set of recommendations rather than a long list of candidates. Based on all results, high quality top-20 recommendation maximize SRI without letting recall drop unsatisfactorily.

Experiments have also been performed to determine which kind of users are more important for generating high quality matches for the dating network, the similar users from clusters or relationsh ip based users? Two sets of experiments are performed.  X  In the first setting, the size of GrA and GrB is fixed as 200. The usual  X  In the second setting, the variance between the two groups Diff (# GrA, Results show that when more similar users rather than relationship-based users are added the success rate improvement (S RI) is lower than adding more relation ship-based users against the current pairs. The SR and SRI obtained from the first setting are 0.19 and 1.0 respectiv ely, whereas in the second setting SR and SRI are 0.29 and 1.4 respectively considering all suggested matching pairs. Empirical analysis ascertains that by utilising clustering to increase the size of GrA and GrB by small amount and equalising two groups, the recommendation is improved as well as new users are considered in matching.

Due to the use of small networks of relationship-based users, the proposed personalized social matching system is able to generate recommendations in ac-ceptable time frame -it takes about 2 hours to generate r ecommendations for 100,000 users excluding the offline activities such as clustering of users, training of SVM model and calculation of importance table for the members according to common gender and age to be used in SVM. The proposed social matching system is able to generate high quality recommendations to users. The quality of the recommendations is enhanced by the following techniques: 1) All the rec-ommendations are generated by good seed users who have above thirty previous partners in a defined period. 2) The recommendations are among relationship-based users who are generated by the utilization of social network X  X  background knowledge. 3) To solve the cold-start issue but still ensuring the recommenda-tion quality, the system add-on layer only groups users who are similar to the seed pairs. This method avoids introducing any random users and keeps the relationships among users. 4) Three similarity scores are utilised to determine the matching pair quality by measuring similarity level against seed pairs and relationship-based users, and compatibility between the matching pair. The de-cision tree model is used for producing the weights for these similarity scores. The proposed system gathers relationship-based users, forms relationship-based users networks, explores the similarity le vel between relationship-based users and seed users, explores the compatibility between potential partners and then make partner recommendations in order to incr ease the likelihood of successful reply. This innovative system combines the following three algorithms to generate the potential partners: (1) An instance-based similarity algorithm for predicting sim-ilarity between the seed users and relation ship-based user that forms potential high quality recommendation and reduces the number of users that the matching system needs to be considered; (2) A K-means similar user checking algorithm that helps to overcome the problems that the standard recommender techniques usually suffer, including the absence of knowledge, the cold-start problem and the sparse user data; and (3) A user compatibility algorithm that conducts the two-way matching between users by utilising the SVM predictive data mining algorithm. Empirical analysis show that the succes s rate has been improved from the baseline results of 19% to 31% by using the proposed system.
