 The automatic summarization of text is a promi-nent task in the field of natural language processing (NLP). While significant achievements have been made using statistical analysis and sentence extrac-tion,  X  X rue abstractive summarization remains a re-searcher X  X  dream X  (Radev et al., 2002). Although existing systems produce high-quality summaries of relatively simple articles, there are limitations as to the types of documents these systems can handle.
One such limitation is the summarization of mul-timodal documents: no existing system is able to in-corporate the non-text portions of a document (e.g., information graphics, images) into the overall sum-mary. Carberry et al. (2006) showed that the con-tent of information graphics is often not repeated in the article X  X  text, meaning important information may be overlooked if the graphical content is not in-cluded in the summary. Systems that perform statis-tical analysis of text and extract sentences from the original article to assemble a summary cannot access the information contained in non-text components, let alone seamlessly combine that information with the extracted text. The problem is that information from the text and graphical components can only be integrated at the conceptual level, necessitating a se-mantic understanding of the underlying concepts.
Our proposed framework enables the genera-tion of abstractive summaries from unified semantic models, regardless of the original format of the in-formation sources. We contend that this framework is more akin to the human process of conceptual in-tegration and regeneration in writing an abstract, as compared to the traditional NLP techniques of rat-ing and extracting sentences to form a summary. Furthermore, this approach enables us to generate summary sentences about the information collected from graphical formats, for which there are no sen-tences available for extraction, and helps avoid the issues of coherence and ambiguity that tend to affect extraction-based summaries (Nenkova, 2006). Summarization is generally seen as a two-phase pro-cess: identifying the important elements of the doc-ument, and then using those elements to construct a summary. Most work in this area has focused on extractive summarization, assembling the summary from sentences representing the information in a document (Kupiec et al., 1995). Statistical methods are often employed to find key words and phrases (Witbrock and Mittal, 1999). Discourse structure (Marcu, 1997) also helps indicate the most impor-tant sentences. Various machine learning techniques have been applied (Aone et al., 1999; Lin, 1999), as well as approaches combining surface, content, rel-evance and event features (Wong et al., 2008).
However, a few efforts have been directed to-wards abstractive summaries, including the modifi-cation (i.e., editing and rewriting) of extracted sen-tences (Jing and McKeown, 1999) and the genera-tion of novel sentences based on a deeper under-standing of the concepts being described. Lexical chains, which capture relationships between related terms in a document, have shown promise as an in-termediate representation for producing summaries (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997). Our work shares sim-ilarities with the knowledge-based text condensation model of Reimer and Hahn (1988), as well as with Rau et al. (1989), who developed an information ex-traction approach for conceptual information sum-marization. While we also build a conceptual model, we believe our method of construction will produce a richer representation. Moreover, Reimer and Hahn did not actually produce a natural language sum-mary, but rather a condensed text graph.

Efforts towards the summarization of multimodal documents have included na  X   X ve approaches relying on image captions and direct references to the im-age in the text (Bhatia et al., 2009), while content-based image analysis and NLP techniques are being combined for multimodal document indexing and retrieval in the medical domain (N  X  ev  X  eol et al., 2009). Our method consists of the following steps: building the semantic model, rating the informational con-tent, and generating a summary. We construct the semantic model in a knowledge representation based on typed, structured objects organized under a foun-dational ontology (McDonald, 2000). To analyze the text, we use Sparser, 1 a linguistically-sound, phrase structure-based chart parser with an extensive and extendible semantic grammar (McDonald, 1992). For the purposes of this proposal, we assume a rela-tively complete semantic grammar exists for the do-main of documents to be summarized. In the proto-type implementation (currently in progress), we are manually extending an existing grammar on an as-needed basis, with plans for large-scale learning of new rules and ontology definitions as future work. Projects like the Never-Ending Language Learner (Carlson et al., 2010) may enable us to induce these resources automatically.

Although our framework is general enough to cover any image type, as well as other modalities (e.g., audio, video), since image understanding re-search has not yet developed tools capable of ex-tracting semantic content from every possible im-age, we must restrict our focus to a limited class of images for the prototype implementation. Informa-tion graphics, such as bar charts and line graphs, are commonly found in popular media (e.g., magazines, newspapers) accompanying article text. To integrate this graphical content, we use the SIGHT system (Demir et al., 2010b) which identifies the intended message of a bar chart or line graph along with other salient propositions conveyed by the graphic. Ex-tending the prototype to incorporate other modalities would not entail a significant change to the frame-work. However, it would require adding a module capable of mapping the particular modality to its un-derlying message-level semantic content.

The next sections provide detail regarding the steps of our method, which will be illustrated on a short article from the May 29, 2006 edition of Businessweek magazine entitled,  X  X ill Medtronic X  X  Pulse Quicken? X  2 This particular article was chosen due to good coverage in the existing Sparser gram-mar for the business news domain, and because it ap-pears in the corpus of multimodal documents made available by the SIGHT project. 3.1 Semantic Modeling Figure 1 shows a high-level (low-detail) overview of the type of semantic model we can build using Sparser and SIGHT. This particular example mod-els the article text (including title) and line graph from the Medtronic article. Each box represents an individual concept recognized in the document. Lines connecting boxes correspond to relationships between concepts. In the interest of space, the in-dividual attributes of the model entries have been omitted from this diagram, but are available in Fig-ure 2, which zooms into a fragment of the model showing the concepts that are eventually rated most salient (Section 3.2) and selected for inclusion in the summary (Section 3.3). The top portion of each box in Figure 2 indicates the name of the conceptual category (with a number to distinguish between in-stances), the middle portion shows various attributes of the concept with their values, and the bottom por-tion contains some of the original phrasings from the text that were used to express these concepts (formally stored as a synchronous TAG) (McDon-ald and Greenbacker, 2010)). Attribute values in an-gle brackets ( &lt;&gt; ) are references to other concepts, hash symbols (#) refer to a concept or category that has not been instantiated in the current model, and each expression is preceded by a sentence tag (e.g.,  X  X 1S4 X  stands for  X  X aragraph 1, sentence 4 X ).
As illustrated in this example, concepts conveyed by the graphics in the document can also be included in the semantic model. The overall intended mes-sage (ChangeTrend1) and additional propositions (Volatile1, StockPriceChange3, etc.) that SIGHT extracts from the line graph and deems important are added to the model produced by Sparser by sim-ply inserting new concepts, filling slots for existing concepts, and creating new connections. This way, information gathered from both text and graphical sources can be integrated at the conceptual level re-gardless of the format of the source. 3.2 Rating Content Once document analysis is complete and the seman-tic model has been built, we must determine which concepts conveyed by the document and captured in the model are most salient. Intuitively, the con-cepts containing the most information and having the most connections to other important concepts in the model are those we X  X  like to convey in the sum-mary. We propose the use of an information den-sity metric (ID) which rates a concept X  X  importance based on a number of factors: 3  X  Completeness of attributes: the concept X  X   X  Number of connections/relationships ( n ) with  X  Number of expressions ( e ) realizing the con- X  Prominence based on document and rhetorical Saturation refers to the level of completeness with which the knowledge base entry for a given concept is  X  X illed-out X  by information obtained from the doc-ument. As information is collected about a concept, the corresponding slots in its concept model entry are assigned values. The more slots that are filled, the more we know about a given instance of a con-cept. When all slots are filled, the model entry for that concept is  X  X omplete, X  at least as far as the on-tological definition of the concept category is con-cerned. As saturation level is sensitive to the amount of detail in the ontology definition, this factor must be normalized by the number of attribute slots in its definition, thus log ( s ) above.

In Figure 3 we can see an example of relative saturation level by comparing the attribute slots for Company2 with that of Company1 in Figure 2. Since the  X  X tock X  slot is filled for Medtronic and remains empty for Harris Nesbitt, we say that the concept for Company1 is more saturated (i.e., more complete) than that of Company2.

Document and rhetorical structure ( W D and W R ) take into account the location of a concept within a document (e.g., mentioned in the title) and the use of devices highlighting particular concepts (e.g., juxtaposition) in computing the overall ID score. For the intended message and informational proposi-tions conveyed by the graphics, the weights assigned by SIGHT are incorporated into ID as W G .

After computing the ID of each concept, we will apply Demir X  X  (2010a) graph-based ranking algo-rithm to select items for the summary. This algo-rithm is based on PageRank (Page et al., 1999), but with several changes. Beyond centrality assessment based on relationships between concepts, it also in-corporates apriori importance nodes that enable us to capture concept completeness, number of expres-sions, and document and rhetorical structure. More importantly from a generation perspective, Demir X  X  algorithm iteratively selects concepts one at a time, re-ranking the remaining items by increasing the weight of related concepts and discounting redun-dant ones. Thus, we favor concepts that ought to be conveyed together while avoiding redundancy. 3.3 Generating a Summary After we determine which concepts are most im-portant as scored by ID, the next step is to de-cide what to say about them and express these el-ements as sentences. Following the generation tech-nique of McDonald and Greenbacker (2010), the ex-pressions observed by the parser and stored in the model are used as the  X  X aw material X  for express-ing the concepts and relationships. The two most important concepts as rated in the semantic model built from the Medtronic article would be Company1 ( X  X edtronic X ) and Person1 ( X  X oanne Wuensch, X  a stock analyst). To generate a single summary sen-tence for this document, we should try to find some way of expressing these concepts together using the available phrasings. Since there is no direct link between these two concepts in the model (see Fig-ure 1), none of the collected phrasings can express both concepts at the same time. Instead, we need to find a third concept that provides a semantic link be-tween Company1 and Person1. If multiple options are available, deciding which linking concept to use becomes a microplanning problem, with the choice depending on linguistic constraints and the relative importance of the applicable linking concepts. In this example, a reasonable selection would be TargetStockPrice1 (see Figure 1). Combining orig-inal phrasings from all three concepts (via substi-tution and adjunction operations on the underlying TAG trees), along with a  X  X uilt-in X  realization inher-ited by the TargetStockPrice category (a subtype of Expectation  X  not shown in the figure), produces a construction resulting in this final surface form: Thus, we generate novel sentences, albeit with some  X  X ecycled X  expressions, to form an abstractive sum-mary of the original document.

Studies have shown that nearly 80% of human-written summary sentences are produced by a cut-and-paste technique of reusing original sentences and editing them together in novel ways (Jing and McKeown, 1999). By reusing selected short phrases ( X  X utting X ) coupled together with generalized con-structions ( X  X asting X ), we can generate abstracts similar to human-written summaries.

The set of available expressions is augmented with numerous built-in schemas for realizing com-mon relationships such as  X  X s-a X  and  X  X as-a, X  as well as realizations inherited from other concep-tual categories in the hierarchy. If the knowledge base persists between documents, storing the ob-served expressions and making them available for later use when realizing concepts in the same cat-egory, the variety of utterances we can generate is increased. With a sufficiently rich set of expres-sions, the reliance on straightforward  X  X ecycling X  is reduced while the amount of paraphrasing and trans-formation is increased, resulting in greater novelty of production. By using ongoing parser observations to support the generation process, the more the sys-tem  X  X eads, X  the better it  X  X rites. X  As an intermediate evaluation, we will rate the con-cepts stored in a model built only from text and use this rating to select sentences containing these con-cepts from the original document. These sentences will be compared to another set chosen by traditional extraction methods. Human judges will be asked to determine which set of sentences best captures the most important concepts in the document. This  X  X heckpoint X  will allow us to assess how well our system identifies the most salient concepts in a text.
The summaries ultimately generated as final out-put by our prototype system will be evaluated against summaries written by human authors, as well as summaries created by extraction-based sys-tems and a baseline of selecting the first few sen-tences. For each comparison, participants will be asked to indicate a preference for one summary over another. We propose to use preference-strength judgment experiments testing multiple dimensions of preference (e.g., accuracy, clarity, completeness). Compared to traditional rating scales, this alterna-tive paradigm has been shown to result in better evaluator self-consistency and high inter-evaluator agreement (Belz and Kow, 2010). This allows a larger proportion of observed variations to be ac-counted for by the characteristics of systems under-going evaluation, and can result in a greater number of significant differences being discovered.
Automatic evaluation, though desirable, is likely unfeasible. As human-written summaries have only about 60% agreement (Radev et al., 2002), there is no  X  X old standard X  to compare our output against. The work proposed herein aims to advance the state-of-the-art in automatic summarization by offering a means of generating abstractive summaries from a semantic model built from the original article. By incorporating concepts obtained from non-text com-ponents (e.g., information graphics) into the seman-tic model, we can produce unified summaries of multimodal documents, resulting in an abstract cov-ering the entire document, rather than one that ig-nores potentially important graphical content.
