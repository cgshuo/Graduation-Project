 Unsupervised part-of-speech (PoS) induction has long been a central challenge in computational linguistics, with applications in human language learning and for developing portable language processing systems. Despite considerable research effort, progress in fully unsupervised PoS induction has been slow and modern systems barely improve over the early Brown et al. (1992) approach (Christodoulopoulos et al., 2010). One popular means of improving tagging performance is to include supervision in the form of a tag dictionary or similar, however this limits portability and also comprimises any cognitive conclusions. In this paper we present a novel approach to fully unsupervised PoS induction which uniformly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art across all our corpora in 10 different languages. Moreover, the performance of our unsupervised model approaches that of many existing semi-supervised systems, despite our method not receiving any human input. In this paper we present a Bayesian hidden Markov model (HMM) which uses a non-parametric prior to infer a latent tagging for a sequence of words. HMMs have been popular for unsupervised PoS induction from its very beginnings (Brown et al., 1992), and justifiably so, as the most discriminating feature for deciding a word X  X  PoS is its local syntactic context.

Our work brings together several strands of research including Bayesian non-parametric HMMs (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007), Pitman-Yor language models (Teh, 2006b; Goldwater et al., 2006b), tagging constraints over word types (Brown et al., 1992) and the incorporation of morphological features (Clark, 2003). The result is a non-parametric Bayesian HMM which avoids overfitting, contains no free parameters, and exhibits good scaling properties. Our model uses a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process (PYP) prior to affect sophisicated smoothing over the transition and emission distributions. This allows the modelling of sub-word structure, thereby capturing tag-specific morphological variation. Unlike many existing approaches, our model is a principled generative model and does not include any hand tuned language specific features.

Inspired by previous successful approaches (Brown et al., 1992), we develop a new type-level inference procedure in the form of an MCMC sampler with an approximate method for incorporating the complex dependencies that arise between jointly sampled events. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our model, particularly when restricted to a single tag per type, produces state-of-the-art results across a range of corpora and languages. Past research in unsupervised PoS induction has largely been driven by two different motivations: a task based perspective which has focussed on induc-ing word classes to improve various applications, and a linguistic perspective where the aim is to induce classes which correspond closely to anno-tated part-of-speech corpora. Early work was firmly situtated in the task-based setting of improving gen-eralisation in language models. Brown et al. (1992) presented a simple first-order HMM which restricted word types to always be generated from the same class. Though PoS induction was not their aim, this restriction is largely validated by empirical analysis of treebanked data, and moreover conveys the sig-nificant advantage that all the tags for a given word type can be updated at the same time, allowing very efficient inference using the exchange algorithm. This model has been popular for language mod-elling and bilingual word alignment, and an imple-mentation with improved inference called mkcls (Och, 1999) 1 has become a standard part of statis-tical machine translation systems.

The HMM ignores orthographic information, which is often highly indicative of a word X  X  part-of-speech, particularly so in morphologically rich languages. For this reason Clark (2003) extended Brown et al. (1992) X  X  HMM by incorporating a character language model, allowing the modelling of limited morphology. Our work draws from these models, in that we develop a HMM with a one class per tag restriction and include a character level language model. In contrast to these previous works which use the maximum likelihood estimate, we develop a Bayesian model with a rich prior for smoothing the parameter estimates, allowing us to move to a trigram model.

A number of researchers have investigated a semi-supervised PoS induction task in which a tag dictio-nary or similar data is supplied a priori (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Toutanova and Johnson, 2008; Ravi and Knight, 2009). These systems achieve much higher accuracy than fully unsupervised sys-tems, though it is unclear whether the tag dictionary assumption has real world application. We focus solely on the fully unsupervised scenario, which we believe is more practical for text processing in new languages and domains.

Recent work on unsupervised PoS induction has focussed on encouraging sparsity in the emission distributions in order to match empirical distribu-tions derived from treebank data (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson, 2007; Gao and Johnson, 2008). These authors took a Bayesian approach using a Dirichlet prior to encourage sparse distri-butions over the word types emitted from each tag. Conversely, Ganchev et al. (2010) developed a tech-nique to optimize the more desirable reverse prop-erty of the word types having a sparse posterior dis-tribution over tags. Recently Lee et al. (2010) com-bined the one class per word type constraint (Brown et al., 1992) in a HMM with a Dirichlet prior to achieve both forms of sparsity. However this work approximated the derivation of the Gibbs sampler (omitting the interdependence between events when sampling from a collapsed model), resulting in a model which underperformed Brown et al. (1992) X  X  one-class HMM.

Our work also seeks to enforce both forms of sparsity, by developing an algorithm for type-level inference under the one class constraint. This work differs from previous Bayesian models in that we explicitly model a complex backoff path using a hierachical prior, such that our model jointly infers distributions over tag trigrams, bigrams and uni-grams and whole words and their character level representation. This smoothing is critical to ensure adequate generalisation from small data samples. Research in language modelling (Teh, 2006b; Goldwater et al., 2006a) and parsing (Cohn et al., 2010) has shown that models employing Pitman-Yor priors can significantly outperform the more frequently used Dirichlet priors, especially where complex hierarchical relationships exist between latent variables. In this work we apply these advances to unsupervised PoS tagging, developing a HMM smoothed using a Pitman-Yor process prior. We develop a trigram hidden Markov model which models the joint probability of a sequence of latent tags, t , and words, w , as where L = | w | = | t | and t 0 = t  X  1 = t L +1 = $ are assigned a sentinel value to denote the start or end of the sentence. A key decision in formulating such a model is the smoothing of the tag trigram and emis-sion distributions, which would otherwise be too dif-ficult to estimate from small datasets. Prior work in unsupervised PoS induction has employed simple smoothing techniques, such as additive smoothing or Dirichlet priors (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson, 2007), however this body of work has over-looked recent advances in smoothing methods used for language modelling (Teh, 2006b; Goldwater et al., 2006b). Here we build upon previous work by developing a PoS induction model smoothed with a sophisticated non-parametric prior. Our model uses a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process prior for both the transition and emission distributions, encoding a backoff path from complex distributions to suc-cesssively simpler ones. The use of complex dis-tributions (e.g., over tag trigrams) allows for rich expressivity when sufficient evidence is available, while the hierarchy affords a means of backing off to simpler and more easily estimated distributions otherwise. The PYP has been shown to generate distributions particularly well suited to modelling language (Teh, 2006a; Goldwater et al., 2006b), and has been shown to be a generalisation of Kneser-Ney smoothing, widely recognised as the best smoothing method for language modelling (Chen and Good-man, 1996).

The model is depicted in the plate diagram in Fig-ure 1. At its centre is a standard trigram HMM, which generates a sequence of tags and words, The trigram transition distribution, T ij , is drawn from a hierarchical PYP prior which backs off to a bigram B j and then a unigram U distribution, where the prior over U has as its base distribition a uniform distribution over the set of tags, while the priors for B j and T ij back off by discarding an item of context. This allows the modelling of trigram tag sequences, while smoothing these estimates with their corresponding bigram and unigram distribu-tions. The degree of smoothing is regulated by the hyper-parameters a and b which are tied across each length of n -gram; these hyper-parameters are inferred during training, as described in 3.1.
The tag-specific emission distributions, E j , are also drawn from a PYP prior, We consider two different settings for the base distri-bution C j : 1) a simple uniform distribution over the vocabulary (denoted HMM for the experiments in section 4); and 2) a character-level language model (denoted HMM+LM). In many languages morpho-logical regularities correlate strongly with a word X  X  part-of-speech (e.g., suffixes in English), which we hope to capture using a basic character language model. This model was inspired by Clark (2003) who applied a character level distribution to the sin-gle class HMM (Brown et al., 1992). We formu-late the character-level language model as a bigram model over the character sequence comprising word w , where k indexes the characters in the word and, in a slight abuse of notation, the character itself, w 0 and is set to a special sentinel value denoting the start of the sentence (ditto for a final end of sentence marker) and the uniform base distribution ranges over the set of characters. We expect that the HMM+LM model will outperform the uniform HMM as it can capture many consistent morpholog-ical affixes and thereby better distinguish between different parts-of-speech. The HMM+LM is shown in Figure 2, illustrating the decomposition of the tag sequence into n -grams and a word into its compo-nent character bigrams. 3.1 Training In order to induce a tagging under this model we use Gibbs sampling, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique for drawing samples from the posterior distribution over the tag sequences given observed word sequences. We present two different sampling strategies: First, a simple Gibbs sampler which randomly samples an update to a single tag given all other tags; and second, a type-level sam-pler which updates all tags for a given word under a one-tag-per-word-type constraint. In order to extract a single tag sequence to test our model against the gold standard we find the tag at each site with maxi-mum marginal probability in the sample set.

Following standard practice, we perform inference using a collapsed sampler whereby the model parameters U, B, T, E and C are marginalised out. After marginalisation the posterior distribution under a PYP prior is described by a variant of the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP). The CRP is based around the analogy of a restaurant with an infinite number of tables, with customers entering one at a time and seating themselves at a table. The choice of table is governed by
P ( z l = k | z  X  l ) = where z l is the table chosen by the l th customer, z  X  l is the seating arrangement of the l  X  1 previous cus-tomers, n  X  k is the number of customers in z  X  l who are seated at table k , K  X  = K ( z  X  l ) is the total num-ber of tables in z  X  l , and z 1 = 1 by definition. The arrangement of customers at tables defines a cluster-ing which exhibits a power-law behavior controlled by the hyperparameters a and b .

To complete the restaurant analogy, a dish is then served to each table which is shared by all the cus-tomers seated there. This corresponds to a draw from the base distribution, which in our case ranges over tags for the transition distribution, and words for the observation distribution. Overall the PYP leads to a distribution of the form P
T ( t illustrating the trigram transition distribution, where t  X  l are all previous tags, h = ( t l  X  2 , t l  X  1 ) is the con-ditioning bigram, n  X  h i is the count of the trigram h i in t  X  l , n  X  h the total count over all trigrams beginning with h , K  X  h i the number of tables served dish i and P
B (  X  ) is the base distribution, in this case the bigram distribution.

A hierarchy of PYPs can be formed by making the base distribution of a PYP another PYP, following a semantics whereby whenever a customer sits at an empty table in a restaurant, a new customer is also said to enter the restaurant for its base distribution. That is, each table at one level is equivalent to a cus-tomer at the next deeper level, creating the invari-indicates the unigram backoff context of h . The recursion terminates at the lowest level where the base distribution is static. The hierarchical setting allows for the modelling of elaborate backoff paths from rich and complex structure to successively sim-pler structures.
 Gibbs samplers Both our Gibbs samplers perform the same calculation of conditional tag distributions, and involve first decrementing all trigrams and emis-sions affected by a sampling action, and then rein-troducing the trigrams one at a time, conditioning their probabilities on the updated counts and table configurations as we progress.

The first local Gibbs sampler (PYP-HMM) updates a single tag assignment at a time, in a similar fashion to Goldwater and Griffiths (2007). Changing one tag affects three trigrams, with posterior where l  X  2 denotes the range l  X  2 , l  X  1 , l, l +1 , l +2 . The joint distribution over the three trigrams con-tained in t l  X  2 can be calculated using the PYP for-mulation. This calculation is complicated by the fact that these events are not independent; the counts of one trigram can affect the probability of later ones, and moreover, the table assignment for the trigram may also affect the bigram and unigram counts, of particular import when the same tag occurs twice in a row such as in Figure 2.

Many HMMs used for inducing word classes for language modelling include the restriction that all occurrences of a word type always appear with the same class throughout the corpus (Brown et al., 1992; Och, 1999; Clark, 2003). Our second sampler (PYP-1HMM) restricts inference to taggings which adhere to this one tag per type restriction. This restriction permits efficient inference techniques in which all tags of all occurrences of a word type are updated in parallel. Similar techniques have been used for models with Dirichlet priors (Liang et al., 2010), though one must be careful to manage the dependencies between multiple draws from the pos-terior.

The dependency on table counts in the conditional distributions complicates the process of drawing samples for both our models. In the non-hierarchical model (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007) these dependencies can easily be accounted for by incrementing customer counts when such a dependence occurs. In our model we would need to sum over all possible table assignments that result in the same tagging, at all levels in the hierarchy: tag trigrams, bigrams and unigrams; and also words, character bigrams and character unigrams. To avoid this rather onerous marginalisation 2 we instead use expected table counts to calculate the conditional distributions for sampling. Unfortunately we know of no efficient algorithm for calculating the expected table counts, so instead develop a novel approximation ( n  X  E n [ K i ] b U ) + ( a U E n [ K ] + b U ) P 0 ( i ) where K i is the number of tables for the tag uni-gram i of which there are n + 1 occurrences, E n [  X  ] denotes an expectation after observing n items and E n [ K ] = P j E n [ K j ] . This formulation defines a simple recurrence starting with the first customer seated at a table, E 1 [ K i ] = 1 , and as each subse-quent customer arrives we fractionally assign them to a new table based on their conditional probability of sitting alone. These fractional counts are then carried forward for subsequent customers.

This approximation is tight for small n , and there-fore it should be effective in the case of the local Gibbs sampler where only three trigrams are being resampled. For the type based resampling where large numbers of n are involved (consider resam-pling the ), this approximation can deviate from the actual value due to errors accumulated in the recur-sion. Figure 3 illustrates a simulation demonstrating that the approximation is a close match for small a and n but underestimates the true value for high a and n . The approximation was much less sensitive to the choice of b (not shown).

To resample a sequence of trigrams we start by removing their counts from the current restaurant configuration (resulting in z  X  ). For each tag we simulate adding back the trigrams one at a time, calculating their probability under the given z  X  plus the fractional table counts accumulated by Equation 3. We then calculate the expected table count con-tribution from this trigram and add it to the accu-mulated counts. The fractional table count from the trigram then results in a fractional customer entering the bigram restaurant, and so on down to unigrams. At each level we must update the expected counts before moving on to the next trigram. After per-forming this process for all trigrams under consider-ation and for all tags, we then normalise the resulting tag probabilities and sample an outcome. Once a tag has been sampled, we then add all the trigrams to the restaurants sampling their tables assignments explicitly (which are no longer fractional), recorded in z . Because we do not marginalise out the table counts and our expectations are only approximate, this sampler will be biased. We leave to future work properly accounting for this bias, e.g., by devising a Metropolis Hastings acceptance test.
 Sampling hyperparameters We treat the hyper-parameters { ( a x , b x ) , x  X  ( U, B, T, E, C ) } as random variables in our model and infer their values. We place prior distributions on the PYP discount a x and concentration b x hyperparamters and sample their values using a slice sampler. For the discount parameters we employ a uniform Beta distribution ( a x  X  Beta (1 , 1) ), and for the concentration parameters we use a vague gamma prior ( b x  X  Gamma (10 , 0 . 1) ). All the hyper-parameters are resampled after every 5th sample of the corpus.

The result of this hyperparameter inference is that there are no user tunable parameters in the model, an important feature that we believe helps explain its consistently high performance across test settings. We perform experiments with a range of corpora to both investigate the properties of our proposed models and inference algorithms, as well as to estab-lish their robustness across languages and domains. For our core English experiments we report results on the entire Penn. Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), while for other languages we use the corpora made available for the CoNLL-X Shared Task (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006). We report results using the many-to-one (M-1) and v-measure (VM) metrics consid-ered best by the evaluation of Christodoulopoulos et al. (2010). M-1 measures the accuracy of the model after mapping each predicted class to its most frequent corresponding tag, while VM is a variant of the F-measure which uses conditional entropy analogies of precision and recall. The log-posterior for the HMM sampler levels off after a few hundred samples, so we report results after five hundred. The 1HMM sampler converges more quickly so we use two hundred samples for these models. All reported results are the mean of three sampling runs.
An important detail for any unsupervised learning algorithm is its initialisation. We used slightly different initialisation for each of our inference strategies. For the unrestricted HMM we randomly assigned each word token to a class. For the restricted 1HMM we use a similar initialiser to Clark (2003), assigning each of the k most frequent word types to its own class, and then randomly dividing the rest of the types between the classes.
As a baseline we report the performance of mkcls (Och, 1999) on all test corpora. This model seems not to have been evaluated in prior work on unsupervised PoS tagging, which is surprising given its consistently good performance.

First we present our results on the most frequently reported evaluation, the WSJ sections of the Penn. Treebank, along with a number of state-of-the-art results previously reported (Table 1). All of these models are allowed 45 tags, the same number of tags as in the gold-standard. The performance of our models is strong, particularly the 1HMM. We also see that incorporating a character language model (1HMM-LM) leads to further gains in performance, improving over the best reported scores under both M-1 and VM. We have omitted the results for the HMM-LM as experimentation showed that the local Gibbs sampler became hopelessly stuck, failing to mix due to the model X  X  deep structure (its peak per-formance was  X  55% ).

To evaluate the effectiveness of the PYP prior we include results using a Dirichlet Process prior (DP). We see that for all models the use of the PYP pro-vides some gain for the HMM, but diminishes for the 1HMM. This is perhaps a consequence of the expected table count approximation for the type-sampled PYP-1HMM: the DP relies less on the table counts than the PYP.

If we restrict the model to bigrams we see a considerable drop in performance. Note that the bigram PYP-HMM outperforms the closely related BHMM (the main difference being that we smooth tag bigrams with unigrams). It is also interesting to compare the bigram PYP-1HMM to the closely related model of Lee et al. (2010). That model incorrectly assumed independence of the conditional sampling distributions, resulting in a accuracy of 66.4%, well below that of our model.
Figures 4 and 5 provide insight into the behavior of the sampling algorithms. The former shows that both our models and mkcls induce a more uniform distribution over tags than specified by the treebank. It is unclear whether it is desirable for models to exhibit behavior closer to the treebank, which ded-icates separate tags to very infrequent phenomena while lumping the large range of noun types into a single category. The graph in Figure 5 shows that the type-based 1HMM sampler finds a good tagging extremely quickly and then sticks with it, save for the occasional step change demonstrated by the 1HMM-LM line. The locally sampled model is far slower to converge, rising slowly and plateauing well below the other models.
 In Figure 6 we compare the distributions over WSJ tags for mkcls and the PYP-1HMM-LM. On the macro scale we can see that our model induces a sparser distribution. With closer inspection we can identify particular improvements our model makes. In the first column for mkcls and the third column for our model we can see similar classes with sig-nificant counts for DTs and PRPs, indicating a class that the models may be using to represent the start of sentences (informed by start transitions or capi-talisation). This column exemplifies the sparsity of the PYP model X  X  posterior.

We continue our evaluation on the CoNLL multilingual corpora (Table 2). These results show a highly consistent story of performance for our models across diverse corpora. In all cases the PYP-1HMM outperforms the PYP-HMM, which are both outperformed by the PYP-1HMM-LM. The character language model provides large gains in performance on a number of corpora, in particular those with rich morphology (Arabic +5%, Portuguese +5%, Spanish +4%). We again note the strong performance of the mkcls model, significantly beating recently published state-of-the-art results for both Dutch and Swedish. Overall our best model (PYP-1HMM-LM) outperforms both the state-of-the-art, where previous work exists, as well as mkcls consistently across all languages. The hidden Markov model, originally developed by Brown et al. (1992), continues to be an effective modelling structure for PoS induction. We have combined hierarchical Bayesian priors with a tri-gram HMM and character language model to pro-duce a model with consistently state-of-the-art per-formance across corpora in ten languages. How-ever our analysis indicates that there is still room for improvement, particularly in model formulation and developing effective inference algorithms.

Induced tags have already proven their usefulness in applications such as Machine Translation, thus it will prove interesting as to whether the improve-ments seen from our models can lead to gains in downstream tasks. The continued successes of mod-els combining hierarchical Pitman-Yor priors with expressive graphical models attests to this frame-work X  X  enduring attraction, we foresee continued interest in applying this technique to other NLP tasks.
