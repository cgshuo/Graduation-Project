 The common tags given by multiple users to a particular document are often semantically relevant to the document and each tag repre-sents a specific topic. In this paper, we attempt to emulate human tagging behavior to recommend tags by considering the concepts contained in documents. Specifically, we represent each document using a few most relevant concepts contained in the document, where the concept space is derived from Wikipedia. Tags are then recommended based on the tag concept model derived from the an-notated documents of each tag. Evaluated on a Delicious dataset of more than 53K documents, the proposed technique achieved com-parable tag recommendation accuracy as the state-of-the-art, while yielding an order of magnitude speed-up.

Digital resources are increasingly being organized, summarized, shared and searched using tagging mechanisms. Consequently, there is immense research interest in e ffi cient and e ff ommendation techniques to boost manual tagging to cope with the continuously growing amount of digital data being produced.
In collaborative tagging, often, people emulate or share others X  tagging behavior. As a result, semantically relevant tags emerge as the prominent tags with top frequency of occurrences, and a small set of common tags are typically reused to represent specific topics, which is known as semantic tags [2,5]. Semantic tags are normally common nouns and proper names (75.63% and 70.10% respec-tively), belonging mainly to the category of topic which describes what a tagged resource ( e.g., a document) is about [1]. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that a user subconsciously considers the con-cepts covered by a document when she is tagging that document.

In this paper, we attempt to emulate human tagging behavior, in that, people annotate semantic tags based on the concepts under-lying a document and the semantic tags associated with these con-cepts. Specifically, we adopt a probabilistic framework to model a web document by its contained concepts and the likelihood of the semantic tags representing these concepts for tag recommendation. In our implementation, the concepts are derived from Wikipedia by taking each Wikipedia article as a concept.

Evaluated on a Delicious dataset containing more than 53K doc-uments, our tag recommendation technique achieved comparable accuracy as state-of-the-art techniques, but yields a significant speed-up. This suggests that a small number of concepts contained in a document are e ff ective in conveying the meaning of the document for meaningful tag recommendation. The concise concept-based representation against the commonly adopted uni-gram representa-tion contributes to the speed-up.
The key of the concept model is to represent a document using a small set of concepts contained in the document. In our implemen-tation, the concept space is derived from Wikipedia, which is the largest knowledge repository. Each Wikipedia article ( i.e., article title) defines one concept.

Given a document, all keyphrases, each of which refers to at least one Wikipedia article, contained in the document are first identified through string matching. The extracted keyphrases are ranked by their keyphraseness , the priori probability that a keyphrase is used as anchor text of the wikilinks, no matter where it appears [4]. The lower-ranked keyphrases are then pruned for two reasons. First, the lower-ranked keyphrases are often not strongly related to any con-cepts, and hence are less e ff ective in conveying the meaning of the document. Second, the pruning leads to a more concise representa-tion of the document, enabling more e ffi cient tag recommendation. The pruning is controlled by a parameter ( prune ratio ) set based on a validation set. Then, since a keyphrase may match multiple con-cepts, we apply word sense disambiguation [3] to derive the correct concepts under the context of the document of interest.
With concept based document representation, we adopt Equa-tion 1 for semantic tag recommendation, where P ( t | d ) is the likeli-hood that a tag t represents the meaning conveyed by document d , P ( t | c ) is the likelihood that tag t represents concept c , and P ( c denotes representativeness of concept c to document d . The tag recommendation problem is then to pick the top-k tags with the highest P ( t | d ) values. We next discuss the estimation of P ( c and P ( t | c ) respectively.
Let f ( d ; c ) be the number of times concept c appears in docu-ment d . P ( c | d ) is estimated by the concept X  X  relative frequency with Jelinek-Mercer smoothing, shown in Equation 2. In this equation, l  X  [0 ; 1] is a smoothing parameter and P ( c |D ) is the maximum likelihood estimate of concept c in the entire collection
The probability P ( t | c ) is estimated through the concept model of tag t ( i.e., P ( c | t )) by Bayes X  theorem: P ( t | c ) and P ( t ) can be easily estimated based on their corresponding fre-quencies in the collection, the estimation of P ( c | t ) is not straight-forward. Let D t be the set of documents annotated by tag t . We build the concept model of tag t by a weighted concatenation of the concepts appearing in D t , shown in Equation 3. In this equation, w ( d ; t ) denotes the relevance or representativeness of document d towards tag t . Note that, many documents may carry the same tag, and a particular document may have multiple tags with varying frequencies given by multiple users ( e.g., Delicious).
Let T d denote the set of tags assigned to document d , and f ( d ; t ) be the number of times tag t  X  T d is assigned to d by (multiple) users. We consider four schemes to compute w ( d ; t ), summarized in Equation 4, where f ( t ) is the frequency of tag t in the entire collection. The four schemes are: (i) Uniform Weighting (UW) where uniform weight of 1.0 is used, (ii) Document Perspective Weighting (DP) where w ( d ; t ) is the relative frequency of t assigned to d , (iii) Tag Perspective Weighting (TP) where w ( d ; t ) is the ratio of t being used to annotate d , and (iv) Document &amp; Tag Perspective Weighting (DTP) which combines DP and TP. Dataset . We evaluate the proposed concept based tag recommen-dation using Delicious dataset comprising 144 ; 574 documents and 67 ; 104 distinct tags [7]. After removing very short and unpopular documents ( i.e., less than 100 words and less than 50 users), the remaining 53 ; 550 documents were randomly split into three sets: 49 ; 550 for model training, 1 ; 000 for parameter validation ( e.g., prune ratio, smoothing parameter), and 3 ; 000 for performance eval-uation. The concept space was derived from Wikipedia dump cre-ated on 12 March 2010.
 Methods . Three baseline methods are compared in our experi-ments. The na X ve baseline is to recommend the most popular tags (MPT) to all documents. The state-of-the-art baseline is the one based on language generative model (TPL) reported very recently in [6]. To evaluate the e ff ectiveness of the notion of concept, an-other set of baseline methods are designed by replacing concept by uni-gram ( i.e., words) in the documents. Then Equation 1 is rewrit-ten as P ( t | d ) = ing schemes in Equation 4, we use CM + {UW, DP, TP, DTP} and UM + {UW, DP, TP, DTP} to denote the four methods using concept model and uni-gram model respectively.
 Performance Metrics . The recommendation accuracy is measured by NDCG @ N and Precision @ N . NDCG @ N measures the consis-tency between the top-N recommended tag ranking and the ground Table 1: Performance of methods, where  X  indicates the di ence against the best performance is significant with p &lt; 0 : 01 truth tag ranking by users [5]. Precision @ N (or Prec @ N ) is the ratio of tags indeed used by users among the top-N recommended tags. The execution time is also reported and all experiments were conducted on the same environment.
 Recommendation Accuracy . Table 1 reports the performance of all methods in terms of NDCG @ { 5 ; 10 } and Prec @ { 5 ; 10 each metric, the best performing method is highlighted in bold-face and the second best is underlined. Observe that: (i) unsurpris-ingly, the simple MPT performs the worst by all measures; (ii) all concept model based methods outperform uni-gram based methods significantly by all measures, regardless of weighting scheme used; (iii) among concept based methods, CM + DTP is the winner in terms of NDCG @ { 5 ; 10 } and CM + UW performed the worst in both metrics. (iv) comparing with the state-of-the-art TPL, CM achieves better NDCG @5 significantly and marginal improvement in NDCG @10. Although TPL yields better Prec @ { 5 ; 10 } investigation reveals that many tags recommended by TPL are of low frequency, which may only benefit a small group of users. This is also reflected by NDCG @ { 5 ; 10 } as NDCG measures consider tag frequency in the evaluation and tags with higher frequencies are given more weights in the measure.
 Execution Time . The average tagging time of UM + DTP, TPL and CM + DTP were 21.30, 22.23 &amp; 2.50 seconds respectively. Note that the tagging time for CM + DTP includes concept detection time. That is, concept model based method incurs an order of magnitude computation cost reduction.
In this paper, we propose a semantic tag recommendation mech-anism based on concept model. The concept model enables a con-cise representation of documents by considering only a few con-cepts most relevant to the documents. Comparing with the state-of-the-art, our method achieved comparable tag recommendation accuracy but yield a significant speed-up. Our future work is aimed at incorporating the concept model with other approaches for better tag recommendation accuracy.
