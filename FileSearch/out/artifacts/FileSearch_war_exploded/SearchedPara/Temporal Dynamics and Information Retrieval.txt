 Many digital resources, like the Web, are dynamic and ever-changing collecti ons of information. However, most of the tools info rmation retrieval and management that have been developed for interacting with Web content, such as browsers and search engines, focus on a single static snapshot of the information. In this talk, I wi ll present analyses of how Web content changes over time, how people re-visit Web page s over time, and how re-visitation patterns are influenced by changes in user intent and content. These results have implications for many aspects of information retrieval and management including crawling, ranking and information extraction algorithms, result understanding how the information they interact with changes over time, a nd a new retrieval model that incorporates features about the temporal e volution of content to improve core ranking. Finally, I will conclude with an overview of some general challenge s that need to be addressed to fully incorporate temporal dynamics in information retrieval and information management systems. and Retrieval], H.5 [Information Systems / Information Interfaces and Presentation] General Terms: Algorithms, Experimenta tion, Human Factors Keywords: Information retrieva l, Temporal dynamics Susan Dumais is a Principal Researcher and manager of the Context, Learning and User Experience for Search (CLUES) Group at Micros oft Research. Prior to joining Microsoft Research, she was at Bellcore and Bell Labs for many years, where she worked on Latent Semantic Indexing (a statistical method for concept-based retrieval), in terfaces for combining search and navigation, and organizational impacts of new technology. Her cu rrent research focuses on user modeling and personalization, context and inform ation retrieval, temporal dynamics of information, interactive retrieval, and novel evaluation methods. She has worked closely with several Microsoft groups (Bing, Windows Desktop Search, SharePoint Port al Server, and Office Online Help) on search-related innovations. Susan has published more th an 200 articles in the fields of information science, human-computer interac tion, and cognitive science, and holds several patents on novel retrieval algorithms and interfaces. Susan is also an adjunct professor in the Information School at the University of Washington. She is Past-Chair of ACM's Special Interest Group in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), and serves on several editorial boards, te chnical program committees, and government panels. She was elected to the CHI Academy in 2005, an ACM Fellow in 2006, and received the Gerard Salton Award from SIGI R for Lifetime Achievement in 2009.
