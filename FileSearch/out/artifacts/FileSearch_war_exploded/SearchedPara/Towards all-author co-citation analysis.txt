 1. Introduction
Since its introduction by White and Griffith (1981) , author co-citation analysis (ACA) has gained great popularity in the study of intellectual structures of scholarly fields and of the implied social structures of the corresponding communities. While most studies have applied the general steps and techniques of classic
ACA to different research fields with little or no modification, some studies have proposed new techniques for mapping author clusters ( White, 2003 ) or for statistically processing co-citation counts ( Ahlgren, Jarne-ving, &amp; Rousseau, 2003 ). However, few studies have examined the way that the co-citation counts are defined  X  one of the fundamental aspects of ACA which provides the raw data on which all subsequent statistical ana-lyses and mappings in ACA are based. The present study seeks to contribute to filling this gap, and aims to shed some light on future directions of ACA studies. 2. The problem and research questions
ACA is one particular type of co-citation analysis. It is generally accepted that the co-citation concept was discovered independently by Small (1973) and Marshakova (1973) , and that document co-citation analysis was introduced by Small (1973) and author co-citation analysis by White and Griffith (1981) . Many co-cita-tion analysis studies have been conducted since.

In co-citation analysis, a set of items (authors, documents, journals, etc.) is selected to represent a research area. Relationships between these items are then analyzed using co-citation counts as similarity measures and multivariate analysis techniques as analyzing tools in order to study the intellectual structure of this research field and to infer some of the characteristics of the corresponding scientific community. In general, two items are considered as being co-cited when they appear together in the same reference list of a subsequent article.
Depending on the unit of analysis (documents, authors, journals, etc.) and on citation/co-citation thresh-olds, both the macro-structure and the micro-structure of a science can be mapped, providing either an over-view of a research field or a look at the underlying fine structure ( Small, 1999 ). Here, the  X  X  X acro-structure X  X  may be visualized on the overall map of an entire science with each dot on the map representing an entire dis-cipline, while  X  X  X icro-structure X  X  refers to the structure of a single specialty with each dot on the map repre-senting a single document.

ACA takes the author as its unit of analysis. Compared with document co-citation analysis, this adds com-plexity to the analysis in at least two aspects. First, the interpretation of results is complicated by the fact that an author represents a larger and less homogeneous unit than an article does in terms of what is connoted.
This problem was well addressed when ACA was first introduced, as well as in subsequent studies ( White, 2003 ). Second, defining the co-citation relationship is complicated by the existence of multiple authorship. Unlike the former problem of ACA, the latter has rarely been discussed in the literature.

Classic ACA only takes into account first authors in the definition of co-citation. Specifically, two authors are considered as being co-cited when at least one document from each author X  X  oeuvre occurs in the same reference list, an author X  X  oeuvre being defined as all the works with the author as the first author ( McCain, 1990 ). For convenience, this is termed  X  X  X irst-author co-citation X  X  in the present study.

As illustrated in Table 1 , if authors Lee and Hair are cited in papers 1 X 3 in the way shown in the first col-umn, this definition would yield a co-citation count of one between these two authors.

This definition has rarely been challenged, partly due to the constraints imposed by the main data source that has so far been used for ACA studies: the set of databases developed by the Institute for Scientific Infor-mation (ISI), one of which is the Science Citation Index (SCI) . These databases index only the first authors of cited documents. Although all authors of a cited document can be found in these databases if that document happens to have also been indexed as a source paper (citing paper), the number of such documents, although increasing as time goes on, has traditionally been very small. As an example in the Library and Information
Studies (LIS) field, references to articles indexed as source articles in one of the ISI databases between 1986 and 1996 only accounted for about 7% of all references made by these articles ( Persson, 2001 ). As a result, it has been very difficult if not impossible, to go beyond first-author co-citation counting using these databases.

A study by Persson (2001) is the only one of which we are aware that attempts to compare first-author and all-author co-citation analysis. It takes all the 7001 citing articles in the LIS field identified in one of the ISI databases between 1986 and 1996, and looks at how these articles have been co-cited by each other, disregard-ing the more than 90% of references to papers not indexed by the ISI databases as source papers. This brief article provides two multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) maps based on first-author and all-author co-citation counts respectively, but little detail on how co-citation counts are defined and calculated. It observes similar subfield structures on the two maps, and notes the fact that many well-known authors on the all-author co-citation map are excluded from the first-author co-citation map.

As full-text research articles as well as citation indexes that index all authors of cited works are becoming increasingly available on the Web, we no longer have to rely entirely on the ISI databases in order to collect citation and co-citation data. The time has come for us to reexamine the definition of co-citation and to explore how we can go beyond classic first-author co-citation analysis to all-author co-citation analysis.
The present study takes one significant step towards all-author co-citation analysis, i.e. an ACA which modifies the classic definition of co-citation by redefining an author X  X  oeuvre as all works with this author as one of the authors of each of these works. We took a simplified approach to all-author co-citation in that we took into account only the first five authors rather than all authors. We hoped that this approach would sufficiently approximate strict all-author co-citation counts, as publications with more than five authors were not expected to occur too frequently based on the statistics from the present study ( Table 2 ). Even if this approximation were insufficient, it would still help us to see beyond the classic first-author co-citation analysis and provide an idea of what advantages or problems all-author co-citation analysis might bring. We hope to see what kind of a picture we can get this way from ACA regarding the intellectual structure of a scholarly field, and how and why it might be different from that resulting from a first-author co-citation-based ACA.
Unlike Persson (2001) , who took a highly irregular approach to ACA by disregarding more than 90% of the references in a dataset, the present study compares the results of regular, full-scale ACA studies that take into account full datasets.

One immediate implication of the above definition of all-author co-citation via authors X  oeuvres is that two authors may also be considered as being co-cited when a paper that the two authors co-authored is cited. In other words, co-authorship when cited can also be counted into co-citations. For example, according to this definition, authors Lee and Hair are considered as being co-cited by paper 3 as well as by papers 1 and 2 in the case shown in Table 1 . This is therefore tentatively termed  X  X  X nclusive all-author co-citation X  X  in the present study as opposed to  X  X  X xclusive all-author co-citation X  X  that does not count cited co-authorship in all-author co-citation counting. In Table 1 , we illustrate the difference between the two definitions of all-author co-citation: authors Lee and Hair have an exclusive co-citation count of two and an inclusive co-citation count of three.

Although both indicate that authors are related to each other intellectually, co-authorship and co-citation have so far been considered as two different concepts and have been used to measure different aspects of schol-arly communication: co-citation as a measure of the connection between two authors X  research as perceived by authors of subsequent studies, and co-authorship as an indicator for the direct intellectual and social relation-ship between two authors. Thus, co-citation counts have been used as a similarity measure in mapping the intellectual structure of research fields whereas co-authorship has been applied in the study of research collaborations.

Inclusive all-author co-citation allows cited co-authorship to be counted and as a result takes into account connections between authors perceived both by these authors themselves and by the authors of subsequent studies. One of our earlier studies ( Zhao &amp; Logan, 2002 ) suggests that all-author co-citation is an authentic measure of the connectedness between authors, and may be an even better measure than first-author co-cita-tion since this way of counting co-citations results in higher co-citation rates, which may make it easier to identify interrelationships among authors.

We explore this issue further in the present study by distinguishing between inclusive and exclusive all-author co-citation in addition to comparing results from first-author co-citation analysis and all-author co-citation analysis. For this purpose, we first performed an ACA based on inclusive all-author co-citation counts, i.e. all-author co-citation counts that include cited co-authorship, and compared the results with those from a first-author co-citation analysis. We then carried out a third ACA based on exclusive all-author co-citation counts, i.e. all-author co-citation counts that exclude cited co-authorship. By comparing the respective analysis results, we hope to see the difference that counting cited co-authorship in co-citations can make in all-author co-citation analysis in addition to the differences between first-author co-citation analysis and all-author co-citation analysis.
 In summary, the major research questions explored in the present study are:
How and why might results from all-author co-citation analysis be different from results produced by a classic first-author co-citation-based ACA regarding the intellectual structure of a scholarly field?
How should co-citation be defined in all-author co-citation analysis? Should it include or exclude cited co-authorship? 3. Methodology 3.1. Data collection The research area we analyzed in the present study was XML  X  eXtensible Markup Language. Although XML has had applications in a wide range of areas, the core of XML research belongs to computer science.
Thus, we used the NEC Corporation Research Institute X  X  ResearchIndex ( http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/ ), now a joint effort of NEC and the School of Information Science and Technology at Pennsylvania State University, to collect citing papers on XML along with their reference lists. ResearchIndex (aka CiteSeer ) automatically indexes research papers that both fall within a broadly defined computer science field and are publicly avail-able on the Web. It is a SCI -like tool freely available on the Web, but provides more information on cited papers than SCI does, including their full titles and the names of all authors. Studies have shown that author rankings using data from ResearchIndex are highly correlated with those using data from the ISI X  X  SCI when using identical citation counting methods ( Zhao, 2005 ), implying that using this tool for citation analysis is just as valid as using SCI . More information about ResearchIndex can be found in Lawrence, Giles, and Bol-lacker (1999), Zhao and Logan (2002), and Zhao and Strotmann (2004) .

We developed a Java program to search for all documents indexed by ResearchIndex in  X  X  X eader X  X  fields under the term  X  X  X ML X  X  or the term  X  X  X Xtensible Markup Language, X  X  and to download all of the records that met the search criteria into a local machine. No citation windows were specified in the present study, indicat-ing that publications from all years were used, which worked well for the XML research field  X  a fairly new research field. The algorithm of this program can be found in Zhao (2003) . Although the actual search was conducted a few years ago on December 18, 2001, this is hardly a drawback for the present study, whose focus is on ACA methodology rather than on current scholarly communication patterns in that specific field.
Another program was developed in Java to parse these records, and to store the resulting citation informa-tion such as titles, authors, publishing sources and years of both citing and cited documents in a data structure that was convenient for later data analysis such as counting citations and co-citations using multiple methods.
Because an earlier study ( Zhao &amp; Logan, 2002 ) had found the existence of duplicates to be one of the major differences between the ISI databases and ResearchIndex , the citing documents were examined first by another
Java program and then manually to remove possible duplicates. Citations made by these duplicates were removed as well. The data structure and the algorithms of these programs can also be found in Zhao (2003) .
This way, we collected 312 publications which made 4578 citations altogether. 3.2. Data analysis
Based on the perception of the authors of these 312 publications, we conducted an ACA using both first-author and all-author co-citation counts, the latter both including and excluding cited co-authorship. We followed the commonly accepted steps and techniques of ACA ( McCain, 1990; White, 2003; White &amp;
McCain, 1998; Zhao, 2003 ) except for the way of defining co-citation as discussed earlier. Core sets of authors were selected based on  X  X  X itedness X  X   X  the number of citations they received. Two sets of highly visible authors were thus selected using two different citation counting methods: straight counts and complete counts. Simply put, when a paper with N authors is cited, with straight counts, only the number of citations of the first author of this paper increases by 1, and with complete counts, full credit is given to all authors of the paper, i.e. the number of citations of each of the N authors increases by 1. However, similar to our simplified approach to all-author co-citation counts discussed earlier, we also took a simplified approach to complete counts in that we only took into account the first five authors rather than all authors.

There are no strict rules regarding thresholds for citation-based author selection in author co-citation ana-lysis studies ( McCain, 1990 ). Assuming that the more authors the better a research field is represented, the present study used low thresholds to allow 100 authors to be included in the final multivariate analysis, the maximum number of variables possible when using ALSCAL, the multi-dimensional scaling routine in SPSS (version 10.0).

A Java program was developed to determine all-author co-citation frequencies (both with cited co-author-ship included and excluded) as well as first-author co-citation frequencies, and to record them in three separate matrixes. These co-citation matrixes were then cleaned by deleting authors who were co-cited with very few other authors based on the assumption that authors who have little connection with the rest of the field are not good representatives of the field. Specifically, an author was deleted if the corresponding row/column contained more than 95% zero value cells. The resulting matrixes were then converted to Pearson X  X  r correla-tion matrixes that were in turn used as input to the two multivariate analysis procedures employed: factor analysis (FA) and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS).
 Factors were extracted by principal component analysis (PCA) with an oblique rotation (SPSS Direct
OBLIMIN). An oblique rotation was chosen because it is often more appropriate than an orthogonal rotation when it can be expected theoretically that the resulting factors (in this case, specialties) would in reality be cor-related ( Hair, Anderson, Tatham, &amp; Black, 1998 ). The degree of correlation is indicated by the component correlation matrix produced by an oblique rotation. The number of factors extracted was determined based on Kaiser X  X  rule of eigenvalue greater than one because the resulting model fit was adequate as represented by total variance explained, communalities, and correlation residuals as discussed below ( Hair et al., 1998 ).
The multi-dimensional scaling procedure used in this study was SPSS ALSCAL as many studies have done before ( Kreuzman, 2001; White &amp; McCain, 1998 ). It produced powerful two-dimensional solutions with the squared correlation (RSQ) value and the corresponding Stress 1 measure being 0.99 and 0.05 ( Fig. 1 ), 0.98 and 0.07 ( Fig. 2 ), and 0.99 and 0.03 ( Fig. 3 ), respectively. The two-dimensional MDS maps as shown in Figs. 1 X 3 were visualized using LaTeX from the coordinates produced by the ALSCAL procedure.
With the aid of both factor analysis and multi-dimensional scaling techniques, the grouping of scholars was analyzed, and results compared between different co-citation counting methods. 4. Results and discussion
We will first compare ACA results between traditional first-author co-citations and inclusive all-author co-citations. Then we will exclude cited co-authorship from all-author co-citation counts to see what difference doing so might make. 4.1. First-author vs. inclusive all-author co-citation analysis
We will base our discussion mainly on the factor analysis results presented in Tables 3 and 4 , complemented by MDS maps as presented in Figs. 1 and 2 , because factor analysis applied in ACA has been shown to pro-vide clear and revealing results as to the nature of a discipline ( White &amp; McCain, 1998 ).

Kaiser X  X  rule of eigenvalue greater than one resulted in a five-factor model from inclusive all-author co-cita-tion analysis ( Table 3 ) and an eleven-factor model from first-author co-citation analysis ( Table 4 ). They respectively account for 97% and 96% of the total variance, and the differences between observed and implied correlations are for the most part (almost 100%) smaller than 0.05 in both cases. The factor names shown on bottom of Tables 3 and 4 correspond to column headings indicated by numbers and were assigned based on an examination of the cited articles written by authors in the corresponding factors. Following White and McCain X  X  example ( White &amp; McCain, 1998 ), authors are ranked in the factor on which they load most highly.
Their loadings on other factors that are above 0.4 (0.3 in White &amp; McCain, 1998 ), if any, are also presented, indicating their contributions to more than one specialty. If an author does not load 0.4 or higher on any of the factors, the author X  X  highest loading, whatever it may be, is presented.

The factor analysis result based on first-author co-citation counts produces an excessively large table in both dimensions (number of authors and number of factors). Because of this, the presentation of Table 4 dif-fers from that of Table 3 , which shows all factors in both the left and the right half of the table. In Table 4 , the left part shows only factors 1 X 3 plus all other factors on which the authors loading mostly on factors 1 X 3 have secondary loadings, while the right part shows factors 4 X 11 and all other factors on which the authors loading mostly on factors 4 X 11 have secondary loadings. 4.1.1. How different?
If major factors are interpreted as specialties, the results of the factor analyses presented in Tables 3 and 4 reveal structures of specialties within the XML research field and the associated authors X  memberships in one or more such specialties. A comparison between the results in Tables 3 and 4 reveals that the major subfield structure of the XML research field is similar for both first-author and all-author co-citation analysis. This observation is similar to one previously found by Persson (2001) in the LIS research field, and is probably due to the independence of the intellectual structure of a field. However, the number of subfields and authors X  relative positions are different between the two sets of results.

Both types of co-citation analysis have identified four major specialties in the XML research field: (1) XML or semi-structured databases , (2) Foundations of XML or semi-structured data management and processing , (3) programming for or processing of XML data , and (4) The Semantic Web . This can be seen from the fact that almost all authors in these four factors who are common to both sets of top-ranked authors have been placed in the same factors in the two types of analysis.

The first two specialties are the most active ones, as indicated by the number of authors working in those areas or the size of the corresponding factors. They both deal with XML or semi-structured data management but with different emphases: design and implementation vs. theory, indicating a classic split between theoret-ical and applied research in this particular area. The Semantic Web group has little to do with the other three specialties, which can be seen from the lack of overlap between the corresponding factor and other factors. In fact, this group has a high negative correlation in both types of analysis with the XML or semi-structured data-bases group ( 0.638 and 0.31, respectively) and these two groups are located at opposite ends on the MDS maps ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). The Semantic Web group is different from the rest of the field in that it attempts to add semantics to the Web using technologies such as XML while other specialties essentially deal with a syntactic or data structure view of XML.

This structure is quite clear in the results from the all-author co-citation analysis presented in Table 3 , considering that the XML and relational databases group is highly correlated with the XML or semi-structured databases group, as indicated by the correlation coefficient (0.545) given by the oblique rotation procedure.
The small group of authors labeled as  X  X  XML and relational databases  X  X  represents the research focus of mapping of data between relational databases and XML, that is, the representation of XML data through relational databases or the transformation of data in a relational database into XML format. It is closely related to XML or semi-structured databases because they both apply database theory and technology to the management of XML data. The difference is just that one uses relational database and the other semi-struc-tured database technology. This close relationship is confirmed by the same general location of these two groups on the MDS map ( Fig. 1 ), and by the merging of the XML and relational databases group into the
XML or semi-structured databases group when different factor models with a smaller number of factors were tried.

This structure can also be clearly seen on the MDS map generated from the all-author co-citation analysis as shown in Fig. 1 . The group of authors who study XML and databases including XML or semi-structured databases and XML and relational databases are located on the right, the Foundations of XML or semi-struc-tured data management and processing group along the bottom across from the left to the right, The Semantic
Web group far away from the others in the upper left corner, and the Programming for or processing of XML data group along the X -axis on the left.

It appears that one of the two dimensions on the map, namely the X -axis, measures the degree to which data-base technology is a research focus. From the left to the right, the importance of database technology becomes more pronounced. This can be seen from the group structure: from The Semantic Web group at the far left end that has little to do with databases to the XML or semi-structured databases group at the right end in which the database technology is the focus. It can also been seen from the structure inside the Foundations of XML or semi-structured data management and processing group at the bottom: the core database people (e.g. Buneman,
Ullman, Davidson, and Vianu) are at the right and the XML-related standards and specifications that are not database related in their own right at the left (e.g. Apparao, Champion, Thompson, Paoli, Sperberg-MacQueen and Bray). This reinforces the significant difference between The Semantic Web specialty and the XML or semi-structured databases group indicated by the high negative correlation ( 0.638) between them. The meaning of the second dimension (the Y -axis), however, is not as readily apparent.

On the MDS map generated from a first-author co-citation analysis ( Fig. 2 ), however, the author grouping is not as clear, although the four specialties are identified from the factor analysis results ( Table 4 ). Neverthe-less, it is still quite visible on this map that the X dimension represents the degree of database technology being a research focus.

In addition to these four major specialties that are common to both sets of results discussed above, the first-author co-citation analysis identified other areas of research within the field. The largest two are Natural language processing (NLP), which focuses on techniques for representing natural text in XML, and General database and information retrieval foundations , in which authors, rather than working with XML per se, have tended to discuss general database and information retrieval technologies that can be applied in XML research. The remaining factors have captured some tightly focused small groups including Version manage-ment , Data integration , Functional and Logic Programming in XML , Knowledge management (KM), and Access
Control . 4.1.2. Why different?
It appears that the major differences between the structure revealed through this all-author co-citation anal-ysis and the one found through first-author co-citation analysis are (A) the number of specialties identified and (B) the cohesion level of specialties identified. The picture produced through all-author co-citation analysis contains author groups that are more coherent, and is therefore considerably clearer. However, the same pic-ture represents fewer specialties in the research field being studied than that produced through first-author co-citation analysis.

The first difference, i.e. the different numbers of specialties identified, is probably due to the different meth-ods for selecting the representative authors to be included in the analyses. Since complete counts are used in the all-author co-citation analysis, authors who often publish as co-authors have the same chance as first authors to be selected into the analysis. These authors, however, are not likely to be able to make the cut to the top-ranked authors in the first-author co-citation analysis that uses straight counts to select authors.
Co-authors usually have been working on the same general topics and their being included in the analysis tends to push out from the list of top-ranked authors other authors who may represent smaller, unrelated research areas. As a result, the same number of top-ranked authors is likely to represent more research topics in first-author co-citation than in all-author co-citation analysis.
In other words, when the same number of highly cited authors is selected, all-author co-citation analysis appears to reveal a clear picture of the most active research specialties while first-author co-citation analysis can cover more specialties in the research field being studied but in a less clear picture. This is evidenced by the observation that authors in the all-author co-citation analysis results are very concentrated: the first two large specialties include about 75% of the authors while those in the first-author co-citation analysis results are scat-tered into many specialties. It will be interesting to test whether more specialties will come out if we include a greater number of highly cited authors in the all-author co-citation analysis and what pattern it may follow.
The second difference, i.e. the different cohesion levels of specialties identified, appears to be due to the co-citation counting methods used in the two types of analysis. All-author co-citation takes into account co-cita-tions received by scholars as co-authors. It also takes into account co-authorship that is, in a sense, sometimes an even closer relationship between scholars. In other words, more and stronger links between scholars are con-sidered in all-author co-citation analysis. As a result, related authors tend to get higher co-citation counts in all-author co-citation than in first-author co-citation analysis, which ties authors of a research group closer together and pulls authors from different groups farther away from each other. The result is a considerably clearer picture. This can be seen from the MDS maps: the four groups in Fig. 1 are quite clear-cut there, whereas those in Fig. 2 show considerable overlap even between the four major groups common to these two maps. 4.2. Inclusive vs. exclusive all-author co-citation counts
In order to see what difference including cited co-authorship in all-author co-citation counts has made, we also conducted an ACA based on exclusive all-author co-citation counts (i.e. all-author co-citation counts with cited co-authorship excluded).

As expected, results from this ACA turned out to be very similar to those based on inclusive all-author co-citation counts, especially the MDS map as shown in Fig. 3 , which is almost identical to the one shown in
Fig. 1 . The average distance between the same authors on these two maps is only 0.165, about 14% of the aver-age distance between the same authors on the two maps shown in Fig. 1 (inclusive all-author co-citation anal-ysis) and Fig. 2 (first-author co-citation analysis). Some minor changes occurred in some authors X  positions as indicated by the overlapped author names in Fig. 3 (e.g. Bray and Sperberg-MacQueen, and Hanus and Bern-ers-Lee). However, differences were more pronounced in the factor analysis results, such as in the number of factors identified and in the loading structures. A thorough analysis of these differences is beyond the scope of this paper, whose primary goal is the comparison between first-author and all-author co-citation analysis.
Here in our preliminary comparison between including and excluding cited co-authorship in co-citation counts, we will focus on the number of factors, leaving discussion on other differences to a future study.
The Kaiser X  X  rule of eigenvalue greater than one resulted in a four-factor model this time, which accounts for 96% of the total variance, and the differences between observed and implied correlations are for the most part (almost 100%) smaller than 0.05. These four factors correspond to the first four factors in Table 3 , but authors in factor 5 in Table 3  X  XML and relational databases  X  were placed here into the same factor as those in factor 1 of Table 3  X  XML or semi-structured databases .

This merging was not surprising. As we discussed above, these two specialties in Table 3 were closely related intellectually as seen from the nature of their research, from the high correlation coefficient produced by the factor analysis procedure, from their same general locations on the MDS map, and from the fact that they merged into one single group when a factor model with a smaller number of factors was tried based on inclu-sive co-citation counts. The fact that they were separated out, although vaguely, only when cited co-author-ship was included in co-citation counting suggests that this distinction was probably due less to intellectual differences between the two groups as indicated by co-citations but more to the social relationships between authors within the XML and relational databases group as represented by co-authorship. Indeed, a very large portion of the inclusive co-citation counts of authors in this group was gained through co-authorship, e.g. 91% between Zhang and Tufte and between Zhang and He, and 72% between Shanmugasundaram and He.
 Another example of this phenomenon is that of the three editors of the XML standard document, Bray,
Paoli and Sperberg-MacQueen. The exclusive all-author co-citation analysis placed them into factor 2, Foun-dations of XML or semi-structured data management and processing , without any overlap with factor 3, Pro-gramming for, and processing of, XML data . However, the inclusive all-author co-citation analysis gave them almost identical loadings on factors 2 and 3 ( Table 3 ). Most of their inclusive co-citation counts were obtained through the highly-cited XML standard document they co-edited  X  98% between Sperberg-MacQueen and
Paoli, 87% between Bray and Sperberg-MacQueen, and 85% between Paoli and Bray  X  which may have sep-arated them out from factor 2 in the results based on inclusive co-citation counts ( Table 3 ).

It therefore appears that inclusive all-author co-citation counts tend to separate authors of highly cited multi-author papers from the specialty to which their papers belong intellectually. This means that inclusive all-author co-citation counts may not work as well as exclusive all-author co-citation counts if the purpose is to map the intellectual structure of a research field, especially when there exist rival research groups or com-peting schools of thought in a field. On the other hand, inclusive all-author co-citation analysis allows the detection of tightly focused research areas or topics within larger research specialties, and, more importantly, supports the study of social relationships between authors. The latter has been considered as one of the advan-tages of author co-citation analysis over document co-citation analysis, but which has not been well demon-strated in ACA studies to date. 5. Conclusion
We have examined one of the fundamental aspects of author co-citation analysis (ACA) that has rarely been touched since its introduction in 1981, how the way that the co-citation counts are defined which provide the raw data on which all subsequent statistical analyses and mappings are based.

A comparison between first-author and all-author co-citation analyses of the XML research field has indi-cated that an all-author co-citation analysis, which takes into account more links between related authors, results in a considerably clearer picture of the intellectual structure of a research field than the classic first-author co-citation analysis. Although the same number of authors selected by citedness when counting all authors tends to represent fewer specialties than counting only first authors, this should not be a problem if future studies can confirm that including a larger number of authors in the analysis will increase the number of specialties identified. Some techniques and software programs such as Pathfinder networks (PFNETs) cer-tainly would allow this. For example, it has been reported that PFNETs when applied to ACA allow about 200 author names to be mapped, and that they have shown considerable advantages for ACA ( White, 2003 ). When counting all authors in ACA studies, the question of how to define co-citation needs to be answered.
If we simply modify the traditional definition by redefining an authors X  oeuvre as all works with this author as one rather than as the first of the authors of each of these works, two authors could also be considered as being co-cited when a paper co-authored by them is cited. We have presented a preliminary comparison between the
ACA results from this inclusive way of counting all-author co-citations and those from excluding cited co-authorship from co-citation counts. The result was in favor of exclusive co-citation counts in the study of intel-lectual structures on the one hand, but it revealed the potential of inclusive co-citation counts in the study of social relationships in ACA on the other.

ACA has been shown to be a powerful approach to the study of scholarly communication. However, since collecting co-citation counts in the print world is nearly impossible without the aid of citation indexes, ACA studies have been relying heavily on the ISI databases, and consequently have been limited to first-author co-citation. As full-text scholarly publications and tools for searching them are becoming increasingly available on the Web, there are now alternatives to the ISI databases for collecting co-citation data, allowing us to go beyond first-author co-citation towards all-author co-citation. As the present study shows by example, this provides us with a clearer picture of scholarly communication patterns, and with a way to exploit the full potential of ACA in the study of both intellectual structures of research fields and social relationships of schol-arly communities. We are confident that future ACA studies will take advantage of emerging data sources and tools, and will combine recent advanced information visualization techniques with various co-citation count-ing methods to produce even more interesting and revealing ACA results.
