 1. Introduction
Measuring the quality of academic publications and journals is of ever greater concern. For individual aca-demics, the reputations of the journals they publish in and the number of citations their papers receive affect their careers through tenure and promotion. For journal publishers, ranking lists, whether based on peer review or citation counts, are vital for circulation. While for universities and university departments, evalua-tions of research quality, such as the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) in the UK, determine the allocation of government funding, and make or break reputations. The results of the last RAE in 2001 are available at ( HERO, 2005 ); the next one is in 2008. Geary, Marriott, and Rowlinson (2004), Easton and Easton (2003) have analyzed the results in terms of implied journal quality.

Traditionally, peer review (or stated preference) has been the main way of judging journal quality and many different rankings exist  X  see for example the Harzing database ( Harzing, 2005 ) which is a very valuable collection of 14 different peer review rankings as well as citation impact factors covering over 800 business and management journals ( Mingers &amp; Harzing, 2005 ). But recently more attention has been focused on revealed preference measures which are based on actual publication behavior, typically citation rates from the ISI citation index. An example is the Tahai and Meyer (1999) analysis of 65 top journals based on citations in 17 key management journals. There are studies that combine both approaches such as Baden-Fuller, Rav-azzolo, and Schweizer (2000) which identified 32 top journals as part of an evaluation of business school rank-ings, and DuBois and Reeb (2000) who used citations and a survey to rank international business journals. The method of combination tends to be ad hoc  X  judgment in Baden-Fuller X  X  case and simple averages for DuBois.
Most citation studies either look at the total numbers of citations received by papers or journals, or they consider impact scores. Impact scores can be calculated in many different ways. Most studies use the Garfield impact factor produced by ISI, later the Thompson Group, which for any journal gives the average number of citations per paper received the previous two years. Whilst useful as a snapshot, such measures do have several disciplinary area, and the short length of time within a paper X  X  citation life.

This study is concerned with citations but primarily in terms of the dynamic behavior of citations over the lifetime of a paper. In particular, it addresses the question of to what extent we can predict the future number of citations that a paper will receive if we know how many it has received so far. This would be a simple ques-tion if the number of citations received followed a roughly linear path, but in fact it does not. For any par-ticular paper there may be a high degree of variability from year to year and there also tends to be a long term pattern. Typically, citations start slowly not least because the citing papers take some time to appear in print.
Citations then build up as citations lead to new readers who may also cite it. Then citations tail off as the mate-rial becomes dated and obsolete. There are several other patterns that may occur, including  X  X  X hooting stars X  X  and  X  X  X leeping beauties X  X  that will be discussed later in the paper ( Van Raan, 2004 ).

A sample of over 600 papers from six management science journals has been studied. These papers were all published in 1990 giving a 14 year history of citation behavior. The journals varied in terms of prestige, loca-tion, and subject coverage. If we take a single paper we can trace the number of citations per year that it receives over time. We can also do this for a collection of papers that has some degree of homogeneity: for example, the same journal, or the same year, or the same subject, or the same author. There are several ways in which this process can be modeled. For example Gla  X  nzel and Schoepflin (1995) used a linear birth process while Egghe (2000) assumed that the citation process was basically exponential. Perhaps the most common, and intuitively reasonable, way is to see it as random with some average rate and then model it as a Poisson process. There are then two major extensions to this basic model that need to be considered. First, the move from a single paper to a collection of papers which will have different mean citation rates ( Burrell, 2001 ) mod-eled as a gamma-Poisson process. And, second, incorporating the idea of obsolescence or aging of the citation process over time. This leads to the additional-citations distribution which can be used to predict additional citations given a certain number of current citations ( Burrell, 2003 ). 2. Distribution of citations for a collection of papers
We assume a collection of papers, all from the same year, with some common characteristic such as pub-lishing journal. Each paper is assumed to generate citations at a constant latent rate ( k ) following the Poisson distribution but these rates vary across the collection as a random variable K .

Then, the probability that a paper with latent rate k will generate r citations by time t is ( Burrell, 2001, 2002 ):
The population distribution (i.e., for a randomly chosen paper of unknown latent rate) will be a mixture of the above distributions according to the distribution of rates: where F K ( k ) is the cumulative distribution function of the latent rate known as the mixing distribution.
What can we say about the mixing distribution? When we observe a set of citations for a source (see Fig. 1 ) they are clearly not normally distributed but heavily skewed with modal values typically of 0 or 1 but with some very highly cited papers. Several distributions have been suggested including the exponential ( Burrell, 1980 ) and the generalized inverse Gaussian ( Burrell, 1988; Sichel, 1985 ) but the most common and easiest to work with is the gamma distribution ( Burrell, 1988, 1990 ).
 The gamma distribution is characterized by two parameters, a shape parameter ( m ) and a size/scale one ( a ).
Its probability density function is given by (The exponential is a special case where m = 1). It was shown by Greenwood and Yule (1920) that a gamma mixture of Poisson distributions follows the negative binomial distribution. They used it to model the distri-bution of accidents in a population where individuals had differing accident proneness. (Aside: The usual derivation of the negative binomial (NB) distribution comes from binomial sampling (Bernoulli trials) where it gives the probability of having to undertake a certain number ( r + k ) of independent trials in order to record k successes given a probability of success ( Johnson, Kotz, &amp; Kemp, 1993 ).
The mean and variance of this NBD are given by E ( X )= l = k (1 p )/ p ; and Var( X )= r With this interpretation k must be integer and the distribution is sometimes called the Pascal distribution.)
When we apply the gamma mixing procedure to the time-dependent Poisson process (1) we find, upon substituting (2 * ) in (2) and performing the integration: So, k is replaced by m and p = a /( a + t ). Note that in this case m need not be integer.

Also, E ( X t )= l ( t )= m t / a ; and Var( X t )= r 2 ( t )= m t ( t + a )/ a We can summarise this by writing:
Thus we might expect to find that if we look at the distribution of the number of citations of papers from a particular homogeneous source they would follow the negative binomial distribution over any chosen time period. These results have also been shown to hold for library circulation data ( Burrell, 1990; Leemans, Maes,
Rousseau, &amp; Ruts, 1992 ). This will now be tested empirically. 2.1. Empirical results We have six different source collections each one being all the papers from a particular journal in 1990  X 
Management Science (ManSci), Operations Research (OpsRes), Decision Science (DecSci), European J. Oper-ational Research (EJOR), J. Operational Research Society (JORS), and Omega (Omega). These were selected for their variety on several factors  X  level of prestige and quality; prevalence of heavily mathematical articles;
US and European; narrowness and width of coverage. The number of citations for each journal over the full 14 year period 1991 X 2004 was tabulated and the means and standard deviations are shown in Table 1 , and histograms in Fig. 1 .

There are two comments about the data. (i) At first all document types from a journal were recorded. How-ever, with JORS and EJOR there were large numbers of book reviews which virtually all received zero cita-tions. Whilst a book review could be cited it is very rare. Other journals, especially ManSci and OpsRes did not have reviews and so had a much smaller proportion of zero citations. To avoid this bias, only documents of type  X  X  X rticle X  X ,  X  X  X ditorial X  X  or  X  X  X etter X  X  were recorded. (ii) With the ISI database selection of a year in the database limits does not correspond exactly with the actual year of publication. For JORS for example, select-ing  X  X 1990 X  X  picks up some papers from the end of 1989 and excludes some from the end of 1990. We used the set of papers that were actually published with a date of 1990.
 The mean number of citations (over 14 years) varied significantly from 7 (JORS and Omega) to 39 (Man-
Sci). All the distributions were extremely skewed  X  in comparison with a standard Poisson distribution, where the mean and variance are equal, variances were up to 40 times the mean. The maximum number of citations for a paper ranged from 66 (DecSci) to 277 (OpsRes) although such popular papers were quite rare. In JORS and OpsRes there was only one paper above 100 although there were eight cases in ManSci. The coefficient of variation, which measures concentration, ranged from 1.1 in ManSci up to 2.4 in JORS showing that generally those with lower mean citations had relatively greater variability.

One interesting, and perhaps surprising, fact is the number of papers that were never cited during the period of observation. This is, in fact, a common observation in the literature:  X  X  ... many articles, even those pub-lished in prestigious journals, remain uncited X  X  ( Rousseau, 1994 ). It has been incorporated in other citation models ( Egghe, 2000; Gla  X  nzel &amp; Schoepflin, 1995 ) but Burrell (2001) shows that it is actually a consequence of the gamma-Poisson model we are exploring, and that the proportion of never-cited articles depends only on the distribution of latent rates together with the obsolescence distribution to be considered in the next section.
In each case (except ManSci) the modal value of the distribution of number of citations was in fact zero and the % of zero cites ranges from 5% (ManSci) to 22% (Omega) and 18% (JORS). In other words, nearly a quar-ter of the articles published in Omega in 1990 have never been cited, even by their own authors. This would seem to be a serious case of publishing papers which in fact make little contribution to the academic world.
The distributions were fitted in Systat using maximum likelihood estimation of parameters and v sure significance. Table 1 shows the fitted parameters and the v are extremely well fitted with p -values around 0.5. The exceptions are JORS and Omega. The JORS data are skewed by one very large value of 176 citations (the next highest number is 62). With that value the fitted parameters are so distorted that the negative binomial does not fit. If that is removed, the p -value rises to 0.19 and the parameters values become k = 0.704, p = 0.106 as shown in the table. The Omega result is caused mainly by an excess of citations in the 2 X 3 range but this is presumably a chance occurrence on a relatively small set of data.

The JORS extreme value is interesting in showing how a particular type of paper can generate large num-bers of citations. The paper ( Beasley, 1990 ), which is only four pages long, describes a library that the author had set up of test problems for different OR techniques. Clearly this was very successful with many later researchers using the library and referencing the paper. This is an important point for informetric research in general although not so important for this statistical analysis.

From the fitted parameters we can calculate the negative binomial moments. These are generally close to the observed ones apart from the effects of the extreme values in JORS, and OpsRes on dispersion. There was a reasonably constant relationship between the mean and standard deviation. From the parameters we can also calculate the parameters of the underlying latent rate gamma distribution using (4) . The m value deter-mines the shape. If m = 1 we have the exponential distribution and for m &gt; 1 the shape tends to a normal dis-tribution. Ours are all &lt;1 showing that the distributions are more skewed than the exponential.
It might be thought that the above analysis implicitly assumes that the papers have all reached their total number of citations. This will of course not be the case in practice since we will only be able to observe over a fixed number of periods and some will still be being cited. model implies the negative binomial whatever the period of observation but the scale parameter is time depen-dent. This brings us to consider the second extension to the basic Poisson model  X  the behavior of the citation rate over time. 3. The dynamic behavior of citations
It is generally agreed, and empirically observable, that citations for a particular article do not occur evenly over time. They usually begin slowly when the article is newly published, rise to a peak rate, and then diminish as the content of the paper becomes obsolete. There are obviously exceptions to this: for example papers that become classics and are cited constantly for many, many years; or papers that lie dormant and then perhaps become discovered or fashionable ( Gla  X  nzel &amp; Schoepflin, 1995; Van Raan, 2004 ).
Burrell (2001, 2002, 2003) has suggested modeling this by incorporating an  X  X  X bsolescence X  X  function into the basic citation model that would alter the latent rate over time. When k is not constant the distribution is known as a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP). Burrell (2001) makes the assumption that while the latent rate will differ between papers the obsolescence function will be the same for all within a particular col-function.
 This gives the following generalization of (1) for a paper with known k : And of (2) for a randomly chosen paper:
This general theory can be taken in two directions. First we can consider the number of additional citations papers will receive if they have received r citations by time t . This is the additional-citations distribution ( Bur-rell, 2003 ). Second, we can consider the dynamic behavior of citations in terms of how long it takes to generate a certain number ( n ) of citations. This is known as the n th-citation distribution ( Burrell, 2002 ). This can apply to a single paper, or to a collection of papers, in which case we can interpret it as the proportion of papers that will have generated n citations by time t .

If we assume, as we have above, that the latent rate distribution is a gamma, then the gamma-Poisson model becomes ( Burrell, 2002 ):
However, first we must look at the obsolescence distribution empirically. The questions are: what might be an appropriate form for the obsolescence function, and is it reasonable to assume the same form, and even parameters, across a collection of papers? In terms of form, we can note that if C ( t )= t then we have a straight line corresponding to the standard
Poisson case of constant k . If, as we are expecting, k varies from low to high to low then we would expect an S shaped distribution curve. There are many possibilities here: see: Makridakis, Wheelwright, and McGee (1983, p. 658) and Meade and Islam (1998) who list 29 different curves.

There is another version of this curve that differs only in the parameterization and hence gives the same results empirically:
The extent to which these fit collections of papers will be tested in a later section. Fitting them to citations for individual papers is not carried out in this paper. 4. The additional-citations distribution
In the context of the UK RAE the number of additional citations that a paper may receive is of great inter-est. By definition, the RAE only considers recent papers  X  in the case of the 2008 RAE only papers since 2001  X  and indeed many will only be one or two years old. If citations were to be used in any way as a measure of quality for an individual paper, rather than for a journal, then understanding the degree of predictability of future citations is important.

Given the above gamma-Poisson model, Burrell (2003) has derived the additional-citations distribution  X  the number of additional citations a paper will receive given that it has received r by time t  X  as follows: Let Y ( t , s )= X t + s X t = number of additional citations received during the interval ( t , t + s ). Then This is also a negative binomial Thus the mean additional citations (from the definition of the mean of a NB) is:
This is a very interesting result since it shows that, for known values of m , a , the expected number of additional citations in a future time period is a simple linear function of the number of citations so far ( r ) with slope a  X  C  X  t  X  . Thus, the more citations a paper has received by time t , the more it is expected to receive. This phenomenon is well known in informetrics, often referred to as  X  X  X uccess-breeds-success X  X  or  X  X  X umulative advantage X  X  after Price (1976) or the  X  X  X atthew effect X  X  after Merton (1988) . The value of C ( t ) determines the increment or slope of this line. C ( t ) represents the proportion of the way through its life a paper is, given its obsolescence function. So a paper that has received 5 citations after 20% of its life can expect more in the future that one receiving 5 citations after 80% of its life.

Some special results following from this are: (i) The total number of additional citations is NB a  X  C  X  t  X  where Y ( t ) is the total number of additional citations that will ever be received in the life of the paper.
Table 2 gives an example for the ManSci papers. The estimated parameters (from Table 1 ) are m = 0.89 and a = 0.023. The table gives the expected additional citations for different values of r and C ( t ). Note that by using C ( t ) directly we are not assuming a particular obsolescence function but equally cannot tie the results back to particular years. So, a Management Science paper that has received 5 citations 30% of the way through its citing life could expect to receive a further 12.8 citations by the end. But if it had received 10 cita-tions by then it could expect 23.6 more. This is as we would expect  X  the more citations a paper has received by a certain time, the more we would expect it to receive in the future. Alternatively, if it had received 5 citations after 70% of its life it could only expect 2.4 more by the end.

In practice, these results will be affected by the obsolescence function for the collection. A function with a rapid decay will generate fewer citations in later life. One which involved a  X  X  X ate development X  X  would obvi-ously have the opposite effect.
 Graphs are shown in Fig. 2 .
 Table 3 shows intercepts and slopes for the different journals for particular values of C ( t )  X  0.1, 0.3, and 0.5. We can see that in their early life the differences between journals are quite marked  X  in EJOR the increment for a citation (i.e., the slope) is 3 but for ManSci it is 7.3  X  but later in life the increments are less, as are the differences between journals. (ii) The probability that a paper uncited by time t gets at least one citation by t + s is The probability it will ever be cited is:
So, for example, a JORS paper ( a = 0.119, m = 0.704) that has been uncited after 50% of its life still has a prob-ability of being cited of 34%. (iii) We have seen from (i) that as C ( t ) increases the slope of the regression line reduces. If we knew the form of the obsolescence function (for the collection of papers as a whole) then we could relate the actual time per-iod (in years) to the changing slope. A theoretical example is shown in Fig. 3 . The two different lines are based only on two different obsolescence functions  X  a C (0.2,2) and a C (0.8,6).

We can use this relationship in reverse to estimate the underlying obsolescence function from empirical esti-mations of the changing regression slopes. 4.1. Empirical results
In order to carry out (iii) empirically we need to choose a particular time period and then regress the total citations from then on for each paper against the citations received up to and including that period. Fig. 4 illustrates this for JORS data. The top left graph shows citations from period 4 onwards against those up to and including period 3. The bottom right shows periods 13 and 14 regressed against citations up to and including 12. Two things are clear from these scatter plots. First, the linearity of the relationships  X  whilst there is a good deal of spread, and clear evidence of the heteroscedasticity to be expected from the underlying negative binomial distributions, the theoretical prediction of linearity is supported. Second, the reduction in slope as the periods progress can also be clearly seen.

To be clear about the interpretation of the slope, if we consider a particular number of years since publi-cation ( t ) a paper will have received r citations. The slope or increment is the expected number of additional citations that will be received per citation received so far . The intercept of the line is the expected number of additional citations for a paper that has received no citations by time t .

If this regression is repeated for each time period the slopes of the regressions can be plotted against the time period. This has been done for each of the journals: the values are shown in Table 4 and plotted in Fig. 5 .
These correspond to the theoretical curves shown in Fig. 3 . With the exception of Omega, which will be discussed below, all the curves conform very well to the expected shapes. Clearly the differences between jour-nals are most evident in the early years: thus ManSci would expect 21.4 additional citations for each citation that a paper has received in its first year, while JORS would only expect 5.5.

Omega is unusual in its first two years. The problem is that the majority of its papers have received no cita-tions in these years so that the number of additional citations is higher for papers with zero citations than it is for those with 1 or 2, and this leads to a negative slope in year 1.

Having seen that the empirical results generally conform to the theory, we can now try different forms of obsolescence functions to see which gives the best fit for each curve. The approach is to use Solver within Excel to optimize the parameters for each of the possible functions with respect to the sum of squared errors. First we need to note that the expected value from (7) is for the total number of additional citations. However, the empirical data is finite  X  only for a fixed period of 14 years and for many papers this is nowhere near the end of their citation life. For example, in ManSci roughly 85% of papers are still being cited at the end of the data period. The effect of this is to reduce the size of the slope or increment for any particular time period in the finite case. The alternative is to use (6) which gives the expected additional citations over the next s periods.
The only difference is the substitution of C ( t + s ) instead of the constant 1. This is a value that depends on the choice of obsolescence function and its parameters and so will effectively be part of the optimization of the function.

For each journal the values of m and a are those estimated for the negative binomial shown in Table 1 . The into (6) to produce the slope values. Solver finds the best parameter values for each function to minimize the
SS between the empirical slope and estimated slope values. Table 5 shows the SS (multiplied by 100) for each combination of journal and function. In general terms, each curve could be fitted extremely well by one or more functions.
It would be good if one function came out unambiguously best but the results are more mixed. The gamma distribution has the lowest total SS; is best for ManSci; and is second best for all the others except EJOR. The
SPSS s-curve is best for JORS, DecSci and Omega but is very poor for the others, especially OpsRes. The sec-ond best overall is the Weibull. There does seem to be a pattern in that SPSS s-curve is best for those journals with lower values (see Table 5 and Fig. 5 ), then the Weibull, then the gamma for ManSci with the largest incre-ment values.

Assuming that we wished to use only one distribution, we would use the gamma distribution with appro-priate parameter values as shown in Table 6 . 4.2. Predicting citations
If we wished to use the expected values for predicting citations (for comparative approaches see ( Gla  X  nzel, 1997; Gla  X  nzel &amp; Schubert, 1995 )) it would be valuable to know the degree of variability  X  i.e., to put confi-dence limits on the prediction. This we can do with knowledge of the standard deviation of the additional cita-tions distribution which we can obtain from the variance of the appropriate negative binomial (7) .
This is similar to the formula for the mean  X  it is a linear function of r for any particular time period t given the underlying parameters a and m , and the obsolescence function. In fact the slope is positive showing that as r increases the variance of the number of additional citations also increases which is to be expected. This can actually be seen clearly in Fig. 4 where the spread of points around the regression lines increases rather than remaining constant as is usually assumed in regression. The variance also decreases with time as the additional number of citations expected decreases.

It is possible to compare these theoretical SD X  X  with an empirical one calculated from the regression but the relationship is not straightforward. The regression calculates a single standard error ( s ) of the points around the regression line on the assumption of homoscedasticity (and normality of variables and errors). In our model, however, the variance increases as r increases, and both dependent and independent variables follow a negative binomial distribution. The best we might say, therefore, is that the regression s represents the stan-dard deviation for the mean value of r for a particular time period.

Thus, the procedure for predicting citations is: 1. For each journal establish the parameters of the negative binomial distribution. 2. For each journal establish the form and parameters of the obsolescence function. 3. Use these to estimate the mean and variance of the additional citations distribution from Eqs. (7) and (8) for various combinations of t and r . These can then be used to create prediction intervals for individual papers from the journal.

Note that the variances are relatively large. This is because the only thing we are assuming about a paper is which journal it is published in. But as we have seen, there is tremendous variability of citation rates within a journal as well as between them. In order to generate tighter predictions one would need to drop down to the level of the individual paper. This could involve trying to model the latent citation rate for an individual paper based on particular characteristics such as the reputation of the author, subject of paper, type of paper. Or, it could involve a better specification of the obsolescence function for an individual paper. 5. Conclusions
This paper has considered the stochastic behavior of citations for papers published in the management sci-ence literature. The sample of data consisted of all the papers published in 1990 in six well-respected journals. The main conclusions are as follows:
The distributions of the overall number of citations per paper varied considerably between journals with means ranging from 7 to 38. More unexpectedly, there were significant proportions of papers in all journals which had never been cited at all (from 5% to 22%) clearly raising issues about the contribution of such papers. At the other extreme, it was surprising that many papers were still being regularly cited 15 years since publication (85% in Management Science).

The distribution of citations for a collection of papers (i.e., each different journal) could be fitted by the negative binomial and this supports the view that the underlying data generating mechanism can be mod-eled by a gamma mixture of Poisson processes. From the calculated negative binomial parameters we can estimate the latent gamma distribution.

The next stage was to incorporate the idea of obsolescence, i.e, that the rate of citations for a paper (and thus the parameter of the Poisson generating process) changes over time. An arbitrary obsolescence func-tion was incorporated into the gamma-Poisson model, the particular form needing to be estimated empirically.

This model was then used to consider the predictability of citations through the additional citations distri-butions. Given that a paper had received r citations by time t , how many more could it expect? The result-ing distribution demonstrated the interesting properties that future citations were a linear function of the number of past citations, and that the slope of this line, the citation increment, decreases over the life cycle of the paper. Empirical results supported both of these conclusions, and provided useful information about the worth of each journal.

Since the change in slope was dependent on the form of the assumed obsolescence function, it was possible from the empirical data to evaluate different possible functional forms. There was no clear result from this but there was some evidence that the best fitting function depended on the journal X  X  mean citation rate.
In terms of practical predictability of future citations for a particular paper, the variances and therefore confidence limits were very large as might be expected given that the only information used is the publishing journal.

There are several avenues of further research that can be explored: (i) analyzing an older sample of data to give longer citation lives, perhaps back to the start of ISI data in 1970. (ii) Considering the obsolescence func-tions in more detail  X  especially whether the same function can be assumed for all the papers within a collec-tion or whether they need to be estimated individually. (iii) Bringing in other factors such as the reputation of the author, the type of article, or the subject of the paper to better predict future citations.
