Image segmentation is an important process in many image processing and computer vision applications. Although the image segmentation problem has been studied for more than 40 years, it is still one of the most challenging image processing tasks, and demands creative solution for major advances ( Guo and Kuo, 2001 ). The principal goal of image segmentation is to partition an image into several regions that share some common features. Segmentation is very important in image processing and compu-ter vision applications, such as object recognition ( Tao et al., 2007 ; Cerello et al., 2010 ), color reduction ( Ghanbarian et al., 2007 ), content-based image retrieval ( Ozden and Polat, 2007 ), face recognition ( Cheddad et al., 2008 ), cell segmentations ( Kharma et al., 2007 ; Narasimha et al., 2009 ), medical image processing ( Karimi et al., 2010 ), etc. A wide variety of segmenta-tion techniques has been proposed so far. However, there is no standard segmentation technique which would be applicable for all image problems, perfectly. Different studies and different types of image data lead to different segmentation methods with different goals ( Wu et al., 2004 ).

Most of the image segmentation methods require image features that characterize the homogeneous regions to be segmented. In other words, segmentation is performed based on feature mea-surements taken from the image that could be pixel intensity (gray-level), color values, texture, gradient, edges, histogram modes, some statistical behaviour or spatial information. Image segmentation can be carried out using one feature or a combina-tion of several characteristics. For example, texture and color have been separately and widely used in the image segmentation ( Ma et al., 2009 ; Tan and Isa, 2011 ; Yu et al., 2010 ). Successful image segmentation is not possible based on only one feature. Therefore, in such cases a combination of features is advised. For this case, Ghanbarian et al. (2007) used color and spatial information for color reduction; Ozden and Polat (2007) used color, texture and spatial information to color image segmentation by mean-shift algorithm.

Image segmentation methods are divided into three categories of techniques ( Lucchese and Mitra, 2001 ; Tan and Isa, 2011 ): feature based, image domain based and physics based techniques. Feature based techniques use one or more features to segment images. These techniques consider the features of individual pixels and in most cases do not consider the spatial information; therefore they do not obtain compact regions. Clustering based and histogram based methods belong to this category. Image-based techniques exploit spatial information and consider con-tinuity or discontinuity of image. Region based, and edge based image segmentation methods are famous subclasses in this category.
Physical based techniques use physical model accounting for reflections properties of colored matter ( Lucchese and Mitra, 2001 ). These methods employ physical models to locate the objects X  boundaries while eliminating the false edges. nique like the well-known C-means (CM) algorithm, fuzzy
C-means (FCM) algorithm or other variants of these algorithms is used for partitioning an image into C clusters ( Awad et al., 2009 ; Tan and Isa, 2011 ). Recently, there has been a great interest in using heuristic based clustering algorithms in image segmen-tation and other related fields. Most heuristic algorithms are inspired by natural and/or biological phenomena. Ant-based clustering is one of the interesting clustering techniques widely used in image segmentation ( Cerello et al., 2010 ; Ghanbarian et al., 2007 ; Huang et al., 2008 ).
 que inspired by the theory of Newtonian physics ( Chen et al., 2005 ; Kundu, 1999 ; Long and Jin, 2006 ; Wright, 1977 ). To the best of our knowledge, only a variant of this clustering approach has been adopted for color image segmentation ( Yung and Lai, 1998 ). In this method, Markovian model of the gravitational clustering in RGB space is used for color image segmentation.
 histogram are used for locating the clusters in the image. Hill-manipulation image segmentation algorithm is presented by Aghbari and Al-Haj (2006 ). Clusters are hills in image histogram. growing and region splitting and merging to segment the image.
Region growing starts with a pixel or a group of pixels that belong to the region of interest. Then the neighboring pixels are exam-ined and similar pixels will be added to the growing region.
The similarity can be defined in various ways, and the most common definition is the intensity homogeneity. In Nock and
Nielsen (2004 ), segmentation was done by region growing using statistical information of images. An automatic seeded region growing algorithm for color image segmentation is presented in Shih and Cheng (2005 ). Watershed algorithm ( Beucher and
Lantuejoul, 1979 ) is a region-based technique that utilizes image morphology. In this algorithm, the bright pixels can be considered as mountain tops and the dark pixels can be considered as valleys.
Then, some valleys are punctured and submerged with water. The water will start to fill the valleys until it flows outside or stops flow. In this algorithm, each point will be dropped by a drop of water, if this drop of water can flow to the exterior marker, then it will be considered as an exterior of object, otherwise, it is an interior ( Tarabalka et al., 2010 ).
 intensity gradient. Many edge detection methods use a gradient operator, followed by a threshold operation on the gradient, in order to decide whether a pixel is on the edge or not. Celik and
Tjahjadi (2010) present an unsupervised color image segmentation algorithm which uses multi-scale edge information in wavelet domain and region growing and merging for image segmentation. the theory of gravity, which is called as  X  X  X tochastic feature based gravitational image segmentation algorithm (SGISA) X  X , is pre-sented. The proposed SGISA uses color and texture information to partition the image into homogenous regions. Moreover, to achieve compact regions, the spatial information of pixels is also considered as a feature and is used in the segmentation process.
Therefore, the proposed method benefits from the advantages of both region growing and clustering techniques. However, regions obtained by SGISA are somewhat compact, better than those of pixel based clustering methods and not fully compact like region growing methods.

SGISA is equipped with a new operator called  X  X  X scape X  X  inspired by the concept of escape velocity in physics. Moreover, motivated by heuristic search algorithms, we incorporate a stochastic characteristic with the SGISA, which gives it the ability of searching the image for finding the fittest regions (pixels). as follows. (a) It is a feature based image segmentation algorithm while uses (b) Motivated by escape velocity phenomenon in physics, a new (c) The operators of the SGISA are stochastically described. related work and a brief introduction to the law of gravity is presented in Section 2 .In Section 3 , the physics motivated phenomenon,  X  X  X scape velocity X  X , which is used in this paper is described. The proposed SGISA is introduced in Section 4 . Experi-mental results are presented and discussed in Section 5 and finally in Section 6 the paper is concluded. 2. Background each other with a force of gravitational attraction. The force of gravitational attraction between two objects is directly dependent upon the masses of both objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance which separates their centers. Newton X  X  conclusion about the magnitude of gravitational forces is sum-marized as Eq. (1) .

Force ij  X  G M i M j r 2  X  1  X  where Force ij is the magnitude of gravitational force between two objects i and j , and M i and M j are the masses of object i and j , respectively. G is the universal gravitational constant and r is the Euclidean distance separating the objects X  center. Fig. 1 shows Newton X  X  law of universal gravitation.

Inspired by Newtonian law of gravity, gravitational clustering algorithm was first proposed in Wright (1977 ) and has been studied more in Chen et al. (2005) , Kundu (1999) , Long and Jin (2006) , Yung and Lai (1998 ). Some of these methods are reviewed in this section.

In Yung and Lai (1998 ) Markovian model of the gravitational clustering in RGB space is used for color image segmentation. In this method, colors of an image are clustered in RGB space and major colors are extracted. In the clustering process, image pixels are mapped to RGB color space. Each pixel is a particle with a mass of one. All particles apply gravitational force to each other. The Markovian model of gravitational attraction between two particles i and j was defined as: Force ij  X  G M i M j where Z i and Z j present the locating vector of particle i and j , respectively. This causes the particles (pixels/regions) to move in RGB space. Two particles that moved to the same location are merged and formed a new particle that its mass is considered as the summation of the two merged particles.

In Kundu (1999 ) a clustering method based on the notion of a force of attraction between each pair of points has been pre-sented. The clusters are formed by allowing each point to move slowly under the resultant effect of all the forces on it, and by merging two points when they become too close to each other. When two or more points (clusters) are merged, the sum of their masses becomes the mass of the resulting cluster; therefore, the mass of each cluster equals the number of original points in it.
In Chen et al. (2005 ) the GRIN algorithm, an incremental hierarchical clustering algorithm based on the gravity theory, is presented to construct clustering dendrograms. The mass of a cluster is the number of its data instances. GRIN algorithm works in four phases: initial phase, incremental phase, insert operation and split operation.

In Long and Jin (2006 ) a simplified gravitational clustering (SGC) method for multi-prototype learning based on minimum classification error is presented. It simulates the movement of objects due to gravity force and checks for possible merging. The gravitational clustering is simplified by not considering velocity and multi-force attraction. The pair objects were found by Eq. (3) and merged by Eq. (4) .

Z , Z j if i , j  X  arg min M
It should be noted that the law of gravity has been used in some other fields ( Molina et al., 2010 ; Ni and Matsakis, 2010 ; Rashedi et al., 2009 ; Sun et al., 2007 ). Among them, the works reported in Sun et al. (2007 ) and Molina et al. (2010 ) focused on the image edge detection. In Rashedi et al. (2009 ) a swarm based meta-heuristic search algorithm for real-valued (continuous) function optimization has been proposed. This algorithm, gravita-tional search algorithm (GSA), simulates the Newtonian laws of gravity and motion. In GSA some stochastic terms incorporates with the law of gravity to give the algorithm the ability of escaping from local traps and move towards a global solution.
Considering the works that used the gravitational theory, as stated before, only the work reported in Yung and Lai (1998 ) addresses the image segmentation. The works devoted to the presentation of clustering algorithms based on the law of gravity can be adapted to solve the image segmentation in feature space. One of the drawbacks of clustering based image segmenta-tion techniques is that they concentrate on the optimization of a criterion (e.g., minimizing mean square error, MSE) without considering the spatial information. This makes incompact regions. On the other hand, in gravita tional clustering, two particles that are close to each other respect to a predefined threshold will merge to construct a bigger cluster. This may cause the drawback of sequential clustering. It means that a decision for a particle is reached prior to final cluster form ation, which is determined after total convergence of the system.

To alleviate these problems, we introduce the escape operator for the gravitational clustering and also the values of force and movement are computed using some random terms motivated by GSA. Moreover, the spatial information is considered along with other features to improve the compactness of the regions. 3. Escape velocity in nature
In physics, escape velocity is as the speed needed to  X  X  X reak free X  X  from a gravitational field. The term escape velocity is the concept refers to a scalar speed which is independent of direction. For a given gravitational potential energy at a given position, the escape velocity is the minimum speed that an object needs to be able to  X  X  X scape X  X  from the gravity. Escape velocity, V e a speed (not a velocity) because it does not specify a direction. In physics, V e is calculated using Eq. (5) .
 V  X  where r is the Euclidean distance between the center of the body and the escape point. G is the gravitational constant, and M is the mass of the body which to be escaped from. 4. The proposed algorithm: SGISA
In this paper, an unsupervised segmentation algorithm for color images based on gravitational law is presented. The pro-posed algorithm is an iterative one which contains 3 operators called traveling, merging and escaping. Executing these three operators is repeated until the stopping criteria are met. Based on traveling operator, agents move in the feature space under the influence of gravitational force. By traveling, they can find other similar agents. In merging operator, the regions/points are merged with the closest neighbors. When two or more points are merged into one cluster, the mass of the resulting cluster will be a summation of point X  X  masses. Therefore, the mass of a cluster equals the number of its data instances.

Finally, using escape operator, pixels escape from its clusters with a probability which is inversely proportional to the escape velocity. Escaped pixels absorbed by nearest particle. Fig. 2 shows the flowchart of the proposed method in feature space. Mapping procedure and the three operators are explained in details in the next paragraphs. 4.1. Mapping procedure/mapping image into feature space
First of all, the color image is mapped into a feature space in which the masses walk to find similar regions. In this paper, we define a feature space containing six features (dimensions). Each pixel deals with a location in the space. The first 2 dimen-sions indicate the location of pixels in the original image. The next 3 dimensions are related to the RGB color component values of pixels. The last dimension is the texture characteristic of a small region around pixels, which is the variance of pixels located in a 3 3 surrounding window. In other words, each agent i (pixel/region) is described as follows.
 where N is the total number of pixels in the image, x i , y values of agent i and t i represents the agent X  X  texture measure.
At the beginning, each pixel is assigned to a particle with unit mass. By traveling operator, objects move under the gravitational force of the other objects. The number of agents is decreased per iterations by merging operation. Agents are the representatives for regions and the color of regions is the color of agents. 4.2. Traveling operator The search strategy is performed based on the Gravitational
Search Algorithm, GSA, which explained in details in Rashedi et al. (2009 ).
 ( Rashedi et al., 2009 ). In order to compute the agent acceleration, the forces of a set of heaviest masses which applied on an agent are computed according to Eq. (7) , which is followed by calcula-tion of agent acceleration using the law of motion (Eq. (8) ).
The next velocity of an agent is then calculated by adding the current acceleration to a fraction of current velocity (Eq. (9) ). Finally the position is updated using Eq. (10) .
 Force d i t  X  X  X  a d i t  X  X  X  Force d i  X  t  X  M v d i t  X  1  X  X  X  rand d i v d i  X  t  X  X  a d i  X  t  X  X  9  X  z d i t  X  1  X  X  X  z d i  X  t  X  X  v d i t  X  1  X  X  X  10  X  where rand is a uniformly distributed random number in the between two agents i and j defined as R ij ( t )  X  99 Z i set of K agents which apply forces on the i th agent and pull it. In GSA, the gravitational constant, G , is assigned to an initial value, G 0 , and is reduced by time (Eq. (11) ):

Pixels escape from their corresponding clusters with a probability of P e that is calculated using the escape velocity. Escaped pixels are absorbed by the nearest cluster in the feature space. Escape velocity of each pixel in the gravitational field of their associated cluster is calculated using Eq. (15) , in which Ve k i is the escape velocity that pixel i needed to become free from its associ-ated cluster k , M k is the mass of cluster k , and r i is the Euclidean distance between pixel i and cluster center k (agent k ). Pixels close to the cluster representative, needs higher velocity to become free and consequently, pixels far from, needs lower velocity. calculated by Eq. (16) .
 close to the center less than d min would never escape and those far from the center more than d max would be released. Therefore,
Ve max is the escape velocity of a pixel close to the center less than a threshold d min and, Ve min is the escape velocity of a pixel far from the center more than a threshold d max (Eqs. (17) and (18) ).

Fig. 3 shows a pseudo-code of the proposed algorithm, SGISA. 5. Experimental results
In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, we used two types of experiments. First we examined our proposed algorithm on a large number of standard images taken from public image segmentation databases where the results are reported using unsupervised criteria ( Borsotti et al., 1998 ; Chabrier et al., 2004 ; Chen and Wang, 2004 ; Liu and Yang, 1994 ; Polak et al., 2009 ; Zhang et al., 2004 , 2008 ) and visual judgment. Second, we applied the proposed method to the well-known Berkley image database ( Martin et al., 2001 ) where the results are reported using unsupervised criteria and pre-ground-truthed measures ( Meila, 2001 ; Pantofaru and Hebert, 2005 ). 5.1. Test images
As mentioned-above, the SGISA has been tested on two databases. The first database includes more than 500 color images taken from public image segmentation databases. In this paper, due to page limitation only 7 images are selected to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Benchmark images are shown in Fig. 4 . The size of all test images is 256 256. The second database is well-known Berkeley image database includ-ing 300 color images with size of 481 321 ( Martin et al., 2001 ). The Berkeley results are reported using unsupervised criteria and pre-ground truthed measures. It should be noted that all images used in this article were represented with 24 bits, 8 bits for each color channel. 5.2. Evaluation methods 5.2.1. Unsupervised criteria
In the experiments, unsupervised evaluation criteria are used to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm. These criteria do not require a manually-segmented reference image. A good survey on unsupervised evaluation measures is accessible in Zhang et al. (2008 ).

One of most popular evaluation methods is PSNR that is widely used to evaluate the perceived quality of compressed images. Moreover, in this study we use four evaluation functions to serve as the quantitative benchmarks. These benchmarks aim at finding a better tradeoff between homogeneity of a region and the total segment number ( Tan and Isa, 2011 ; Yu et al., 2010 ). The goal of segmentation is to achieve more homogeneity within regions while keeping a reasonable segment number ( Yu et al., 2010 ). These functions give better values for segmentation methods that form too many regions and have non-homogeneous regions. Furthermore, two another evaluation functions are examined ( Chabrier et al., 2004 ; Chen and Wang, 2004 ). These methods combine inter-region measures with intra-region measures. By defining e as Eq. (19) , F ( Liu and Yang, 1994 ; Yu et al., 2010 ), F 0 and Q ( Borsotti et al., 1998 ; Yu et al., 2010 ) are calculated using Eqs. (20 X 22) , respectively, where I is the original image, I gray level image, ^ I is the segmented image, R j is the set of pixels in number of pixels), C is the number of regions in the segmented image, N ( a ) denotes the number of regions that have an area of exactly a and, MaxArea denotes the number of pixels in the largest region.
F  X  F 0  X  1 1000 S Q  X  1 1000 S entropy and the minimum description length principle ( Zhang et al., 2004 ; Yu et al., 2010 ). This evaluation function is based on information theory and used for measuring the uniformity of pixels (i.e., luminance). Entropy is a measure of the disorder within a region.
 values for the luminance in region j , and L j ( i ) denotes the number of pixels in region j that have luminance of i in the original image.
The entropy for region j , H ( R j ), is defined in Eq. (23) . It is the number of bits per pixel which is needed to encode the luminance for region R j . The expected region entropy of image I , H as the expected entropy across all regions where each regions has weight proportional to its area (Eq. (24) )( Zhang et al., 2004 ). HR j  X  H r  X  evaluation measure is given by Eq. (26) . Therefore, E aggregates both the layout entropy and the expected region entropy. H I  X  E  X  H I  X  H r  X  26  X  contrast ( Z eb )( Chabrier et al., 2004 ) is an evaluation criterion based on the internal and external contrast of the regions measured in the neighborhood of each pixel. If we note W ( p )as the neighborhood of the pixel p and border j as the border of R with length Lb j , the contrast inside ( CTin ) and outside ( CTout ) and the total contrast of the region R j ( CT j ) are calculated using
Eqs. (27) X (29) , respectively. Z eb is calculated using these values in Eq. (30) .

E cw is calculated by the sum of E int er and E int ra ( Chen and Wang, 2004 ). where :: L n a n b n denotes the color difference in the CIE L th is the threshold for visible color difference, step (.) is the step function, ^ IR j is the color value of segmented image in region R

Pre-ground-truthed measures database we have used the pre-ground-truthed measures. These measures are the Probabilistic Rand Index (PRI), and the Variation of Information (VoI) ( Meila, 2001 ; Pantofaru and Hebert, 2005 ) where are among the most correlated with human segmentation.
To measure the accuracy of the obtained results, a set of bench-mark segmentation results obtained from four to seven human observers are available.

 [0, N ). For PRI higher values indicate better segmentation and for
VoI lower values are welcome. 5.3. Comparative algorithms one of earliest gravitational clustering methods for assessment of the proposed SGISA. We use these methods as the same condition as SGISA to show the effectiveness of the proposed method in clustering. For this, SGC and C-means will run in feature space to cluster pixels of images in the feature space. Furthermore, the results of mean-shift are reported. The mean-shift algorithm is a powerful region growing technique for image segmentation ( Comanicu and Meer, 2002 ). The algorithm recursively moves to the kernel smoothed centroid for every data point.
 decreased linearly from 10 to 0.0001 with lapse of time (itera-tion). The parameters d max , d min and y are set to 80, 10 and 80, respectively. The amounts of these values were determined by experimentation. The maximum velocity of agents in every dimension is limited by 2. The SGISA can be terminated after receiving predefined number of regions or when none of the regions merge. Here, maximum number of iterations is set to 20 as stopping criterion. The SGC and C-means were terminated after receiving the same cluster number as SGISA. The parameters of 2008 ). The minimum area size of segments is set to 10 for all cases. 5.4. Results 5.4.1. Preliminary results
In this subsection, the influence of using information of both location and color is examined. In this order, we apply the SGISA and C-means two times to the image to be segmented. First, the image is segmented according to only its color values of their pixels in a 3-D feature space. After that both algorithms are applied to that image in a 6-D feature space considering color, location (spatial information) and texture information of pixels. By working in 3-D feature space, the methods are work as pixel based and the segmented images are not compact, while in the 6-D feature space, we can find compact or semi compact regions. Comparative results are shown in Table 1 . Fig. 5 shows the obtained images in this case. The clustering methods in 3-D feature space are pixel based methods and so the amount of Z and E cw are not computable for them. These values are compu-table for region based methods that have several compact regions.
Table 1 shows that segmentation in the 6-D feature space results in fewer continuous regions than the 3-D feature space. In words, by using information of location, clustering algorithms segment the images to more compact regions, which is obvious from comparing the number of regions for 3-D and 6-D feature spaces. Furthermore, the proposed method gives better entropy values than C-means. It should be noted that in the 6-D feature space the image is segmented to semi-compact regions which is more pleasant for computer vision application with slightly decreasing in the PSNR values. Also, the results of Table 1 shows that the proposed method performs segmentation somewhat better than C-means in view point of measures F , F 0 , Q , E , Z and E cw and number of regions while it is slightly worse than C-means with regard to the PSNR criterion. 5.4.2. Comparative results
Based on the results obtained in the previous subsection, hereafter we apply the clustering algorithms to the images in the 6-D feature space. In this subsection, segmentation results of SGISA are compared with aforementioned comparative algorithms. Results on the first database
Results for seven images from first database are given in Fig. 6 for visual judgments. Table 2 exhibits the objective values of F ,
F 0 , Q , E , Z eb , E cw and PSNR for segmented benchmark images. In all cases, we ignore regions smaller than 10 pixels by merging them into big regions.
 Results on the second database (natural image-Berkeley)
In order to evaluate our proposed method on this database, the results are reported using unsupervised criteria and pre-ground-truth measures in Tables 3 and 4 , respectively.
In this set of experiments the SGC methods due to its weak performance on the first database is ignored in the compar-ison. The results of C-means and SGISA are reported for 6-D feature space. It is noticed that the code of ( http://www.eecs. berkeley.edu/~yang/software/lossy_segmentation ) is used to compute PRI and VoI measures. 5.4.3. Discussion
As it is obvious from Tables 2 and 3 , the SGISA outperforms all comparative algorithms including mean-shift and SGC as region growing algorithms and C-means as a clustering algorithm on both databases based on the unsupervised criteria. Also, the visual comparison of the images given in Fig. 6 confirms the quality of the SGISA in image segmentation comparing to the other algo-rithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm is able to segment a wide variety of images, efficiently.
 Especially the entropy values of the segmented images by the SGISA are better than the other methods. Furthermore, better values for F , F 0 , and Q show that weighted average squared color error of the segments for SGISA, is less than the others; and better values for Z eb show that SGISA is not over-segmented and give the regions that are homogeneous. In Table 2 , the value of E C-means is better than SGISA but the difference between two values is not so much. E cw is the summation of the over-segmentation and under-segmentation visual errors.

About the processing time comparison, SGC calculate distances between regions and merge only two regions at each iteration, therefore, it gets more time than SGISA to reach the same number of regions. C-means find the center of the clusters in an iterative algorithm and calculate the distances between centers as same as SGISA. It is less time consuming than SGISA. Mean-shift is density estimation based non-parametric clustering approach. It has much complicated algorithm than SGISA but it is not iterative and it takes less time than SGISA.

In Table 4 , the results of SGISA using PRI and VoI are better than C-means and weaker than mean-shift. The segments in mean-shift are compact whereas the segments in SGISA are semi-compact and in comparison to human segmentation results that are compact, mean-shift achieves better results.
The final conclusion is that: (a) To have semi-compact regions using clustering methods, the proposed 6-D feature space can be used. (b) The SGISA with the operator  X  X scape X  is able to provide better segmentation results than C-means and SGC. (c) SGISA can be used when one wishes to achieve the separated piece of one object as a unique segment. 5.4.4. Image segmentation in noisy condition
For checking the stability of SGISA against noise, in this subsection we add Gaussian noise to images before segmentation. Then we apply the standard smoothing (mean) filter with the size of 3 to reduce the noise. After that, filtered images are segmented by SGISA. Results are given by Table 5 and Fig. 7 . The obtained results confirm that SGISA is able to efficiently segment the filtered noisy images. Comparison results between algorithms in noisy images are the same as reported in previous subsection. Therefore, we do not report them in this subsection. 5.4.5. Checking reliability
As another experiment, we apply all segmentation algorithms on each benchmark image for 10 independent runs to evaluate the robustness of the algorithms. The obtained results on the image  X  X id X  are reported in Table 6 . The results indicate that although SGISA is a stochastic based method, it is robust against multi-run which is due to escape operator. 6. Conclusion
In this paper, an unsupervised segmentation method, SGISA, for color images based on the gravitational motivated algorithm, GSA, is presented. The proposed SGISA uses color, texture, and spatial information to segment the image. The SGISA is a gravita-tional merging method that segments the image by region growing in the feature space. The Segments obtained by SGISA are somewhat compact, better than those of pixel based cluster-ing methods and not fully compact like region growing methods. SGISA is equipped with a new operator called  X  X  X scape X  X  inspired by the concept of escape velocity in physics. Moreover, motivated by heuristic search algorithms, it has the ability of searching the image for finding the fittest regions that are suitable for merging.
Experimental results show that SGISA has good ability to segment color images. Furthermore it is robust against multi-runs and noisy condition.
