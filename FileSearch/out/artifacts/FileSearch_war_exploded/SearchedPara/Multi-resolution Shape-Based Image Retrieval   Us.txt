Shape descriptors based on wavelet transform are widely pop u -that more powerf u l representations are needed. 
There are other m u lti-resol u tion representations that can capt u re the smoothness of ties as in the case of wavelet. RT can be described as the application of 1D wavelet to the Radon slices of an ima g e. The implementation of the RT helps to handle the line will then allow the 1D wavelet transform to handle the converted line-to-point sin gu -larities in the Radon domain, which a wavelet is best at. Therefore, the RT combines m u lti-resol u tion property to analyze data at several levels of detail. be defined as: jections of the Radon transform where the Radon transform is denoted as: where transform where the an gu lar variable denoisin g [7].
