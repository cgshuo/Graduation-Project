 This Tutorial+Workshop will discuss opportunities and challenges involved in using neuro -physiological tools/techniques (such as fMRI, fNIRS, EEG, eye -tracking, GSR, HR, and facial expressions) and theories in information retrieval. The hybrid format will engage researchers and students at different levels of expertise, from those who are active in this area to those who are interested and want to learn more. The workshop will combine presentations, discussions and tutorial elements and consist of four segments (tutorial, completed research, work -in-progress, closing panel).
 Neuroscience, Experimentation, Measurement.
 H. Information Systems . H.3 INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL . H.3.3 Information Search and Retrieval . Subjects: Query formulation; Search process; Retrieval models fMRI, fNIRS, eye -tracking, EEG , GSR, HR . The progress made in neuroscience in the last two decades allows one to expect that neuroscience (and related fields) will contribute to other disci plines. It has already happened in several social science disciplines, such as economics and marketing  X  neuroeconomics and neuromarketing have been established over a decade ago. The results from collaboration between behavioral economists and neuroscientists have supported advances in understanding of decision -ma king and human behavior [1]. More recently, information systems researchers started a new sub -field Neur oIS (Neuro Information Systems  X  [3]; NeuroIS.org, 2009). Information systems research studies the dev elopment and use of information and communication technologies in organizations and society. NeuroIS is  X  X  subfield of information systems literature that relies on neuroscience and neurophysiological theories and tools to better understand the development, use, and impact of information technologies (IT) X  [10]. Application of neuro -physiological methods for studying browsing tasks, information selection, and relevance judgment have emerged as critica l areas of active research. The broad intersecting theme, among IR researchers and those with strong applied neuroscience background , is development of more robust models for information search  X  models which go beyond behavioral data and account for physi ological and neurologic al responses to information as stimuli. This early work by information retrieval researchers resulted in a number of recent publications that appeared at SIGIR, ECIR, and related conferences. Selected recent publications include: [2,4,5,6,7,8,9 ,11,12, 13,14,15 ]. However, the IR community is still widely unaware of these new methods. We propose the workshop to discuss and exchange experiences among researchers; build a community; plan future work; make other s aware of potential usefulness of neuro -physiological methods and their applicability to their research; enable others to read and assess papers that employ such methods. The workshop will have three main themes: 1) cases and problems in information retrieval that are p articularly amenable to analysis based on neuro -physiological methods (e.g., relevance judgment studies), 2) comparative analysis of neuro -physiological tools and techniques and their applications in information retrieval research (e.g., fMRI versus EEG), and finally, 3) evaluation and statistical analysis methods for incorporating neuro -physiological methods in an IR research study.
 For the theme 1 above, we will invite presen tations and posters on current IR projects that are utilizing neuro -physi ological methods. For theme 2, we will incorporate presentations and demonstrations of neuro -physiological techniques in the workshop. We will invite researchers with strong experie nce in utilizing portable tools such as eye -trackers and EEGs, encouraging them to bring with them some of these tools. We will also encourage researchers with recent experienc es in applying fMRI and fN IRS and other methods based on large imagin g instrume nts to participate. Finally, for theme 3, a certain number of presentations and posters will be sought that place emphasis on metrics, evaluation methods, and statistical techniques associated with neuro -physiological information retrieval data. The workshop schedule will combine presentations, discussions and tutorial elements and consist of four segments. 1) Tutorial -will offer guidance on how to start working with neuro -physiological tools in the context of IR. We wi ll introduce and compare several tools, such as EEG, eye -tracking and fMRI, and will discuss best practices and useful tips, which will be helpful to all, not just those new to the area. 2) Completed research -experienced participants will present finding s and lessons learned from their own work and will consider how neuro -cognitive and physiological tools, such as fMRI, fNIRS, eye -tracking, EEG, GSR, and analysis of facial expressions could further contribute to IR research questions. 3) Work-in-progress -participants, and particularly those who are starting out in this area, will present their planned/current work in lightning talks; group discussions will provide feedback and guidance. 4) Closing panel -will discuss future directions and collaboratio ns between workshop participants. A workshop webpage https://sites.google.com/site/neuroir2015 will be maintained and added to http://www.neuroinfosci ence.org website maintained by Jacek Gwizdka. Selection of papers and posters will be conducted at two levels. Members of the program committee will be assigned responsibilities to conduct the first level review. At least tw o reviewers will be assigned per paper and at least one me mber will review each poster. A final review of all papers and posters will be conducted by the four members of the organizing committee. About 15 papers and 12 posters will be selected, and the associated researchers will be invited to attend the workshop. We anticipate a maximum of about 35 participants in this event, b ut we do not intend to limit participation. Jacek Gwizdka is an Assistant Professor and Information eXperience Lab co-director at School of Information at University of Texas, Austin. He studies cognitive aspects of human -information interaction; his research is situated at the intersection of interactive -information retrieval (IIR) and human -computer interaction (HCI). His current projects include application of cognitive psychology to the study of how people evaluate information relevance and neuro -physiological methods to implicit assessment of cognitive load. He also investigates effects of search results presentatio n and cognitive abilities on information search task performance.
