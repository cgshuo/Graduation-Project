Measuring international collaboration measures of influence as  X  X  X ooperative-choice models X  X . 3. Random-choice model which will allow a measure of two-nation preference to be developed. 3.1. Baseline model
The probability of randomly drawing an author from t is a Probability that both authors are from country s : a 2 s .

Probability that one author is drawn from s , and the other from the alternative set, t :2 a other countries, we have a t =1 a s ; otherwise a s + a t and t overlap.)
Then, considering only papers with at least one author from s , the probability, call it g with a member of the alternative set indexed by t , is given by
We note that, in Eq. (1) , the raw value of the alphas could be replaced by the relative values a following equivalent 1 form will sometimes be more convenient: assuming that sets s and t constitute our full universe, that a erality, we conclude, simply keeping in mind that the relative a  X  X  are being used.

We also note that
Consequently, ratios. This observation that will be useful below. 3.2. Limiting cases ability. But if the s is, relative to t , a minor contributor quantitatively ( a too is reflected in our formula.

More generally, trivial algebra shows that if then see this expectation confirmed formally.

On the other hand, it is interesting that underestimate the probability of outside collaboration, if choices were made purely by chance. 3.3. Same-country preference easily to extend our results to papers with arbitrary numbers of authors.
First note that Eq. (1) allows us an immediate estimate, based on the random-choice model, of same-would be, as revealed by two author papers, when bias is not a determining factor, by g defined as the set of all countries other than s .

Similarly, the fraction of papers with only national authors is a n case of only national authors and no national author are excluded, which has probability  X  1 a n foreign collaboration, is with own-country preference being measured by g  X  n  X  ss  X  1 g Bias within the class of n -author papers, then, is indicated by divergence from this result. of international collaboration for papers with at least one national author? If h with at least one author from s has exactly n authors, 2 and g authors, that there be a non-national collaborator, then the overall probability is of same-country preference is
The point is, with countries varying greatly in quantitative contribution, then EVEN WITH NO BIAS, reasonable that measures of bias be formulated as deviations from the above no-bias value. 4. Cooperative models dicted by the random-choice model: take an approach similar to that in Bookstein et al. (2006) . agreed with the data. We shall build our cooperative-choice model by starting with the random-choice be the probability that a collaboration be acceptable if both candidate authors are from s ; let h

Then the observed fraction is estimated by the probability G
Here the relative sizes of the two populations are given by the measurable parameters a assume that we are using relative values, so that a s + a try bias. But, more generally, we can make the transformation a G  X  X .

Then, since 1 G st = G ss we can determine: or, finally, allows us to estimate the ratio of the h s in terms of the empirical quantities a and G . 4.1. Comments following candidate is attractive: the underlying populations. But substituting from Eq. (2) for g first instinct! random-choice probability ratio and the ratio of population sizes.

 for our purpose.) Then we can select: two authors from the target nation in N 0 2 ways; one national and one foreign author in N 0 N 1 ways and, for completeness; two non-national authors in N 1 two authors, without regard for nationality, in N
Expanding we find this is equal to 2 N 1 /(2 N 1 + N 0 1), or in terms of probabilities, 2 a This agrees with our earlier result in the limit of large N (so 1/ N ! 0). References
