 The ability to predict protein function from amino acid sequence is a central research goal of molecular biology. Such a capability would greatly aid the biological interpretation of the genomic data and accelerate its medical exploitation. For the existing sequenced genomes function can be assigned to typically only between 40-60% of the genes [4,8,12,7]. The new science of functional genomics is dedicated to discovering the function of these genes, and to further detailing gene function [10,27,17,6]. Here we present a novel data-mining [24,18] approach to predicting protein functional class from sequence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on the Mycobacterium tuberculosis [8] genome. Biologically interpretable rules are identified that can predict protein function even in the absence of identifiable sequence homology. These rules predict 65% of the genes with no previous assigned function in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the bacteria which causes TB) with an estimated accuracy of 60-80% (depending on the level of functional assignment). The rules give insight into the evolutionary history of the organism.

Computer based methods to assist in this process are becoming increasingly important [20]. Such methods are especially needed in molecular biology, where there is an overwhelming flood of new data. Here we demonstrate the effectiveness of automatic scientific discovery on an important scientific problem. We successfully apply a novel data mining approach to the problem of predicting protein functional class from sequence. from sequence what is abstractly required is a discrimination function [10] that maps sequence to biological function. abstractly required is a discrimination function10 that maps sequence to biological function. The existing sequence homology recognition methods can be viewed as examples of such functions: methods based on direct sequence similarity [23,2] can be considered as nearest neighbour type functions [11] (in sequence space), and the more complicated homology recognition methods based on motifs/profiles [28] resemble case-based learning functions [1]. The creation of annotated databases of automatically identifying more general forms of discrimination function using data. the prokaryote genome of greatest medical importance. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tuberculosis kills 2 million people each year. Their concern a bout the growing epidemic has led the WHO to declare tuberculosis a global emergency [15]. functional class assignments from the Sanger Centre [14]. (Note that there are errors in annotation of function [5], and this adds  X  X oise X  to the data mining process [18]). The assignments of function are organised in a strict hierarchy (tree), where each higher level in the tree is more general than the level below it, and knowing that  X  X otenial gene X  or open reading frame (ORF) should be used.

We attempted to learn discriminatory functions for every level of the functional hierarchy. Success on these different levels would demonstrate the generality of the approach. deductive database of genes and their known functional assignments. We then processed this data to form sequence descriptions of the genes. Therefore, these descriptions are solely based on features that can be computed from sequence alone. The most commonly used technique to gain information about a sequence is to run a sequence similarity search, and this was used as the starting point in forming descriptions. The basic data structure in the deductive database is the result of a PSI-BLAST search [2] (we used the parameters: e = 10, h = 0.0005, j = 20, NRProt 16/11/98). NRProt is a protein sequence database merging together protein sequences with less than 100 percent sequence identity from a variety of multi-genome protein databases. Using each gene, and each protein identified as having sequence similarity to it, we formed an expressive description based on: the frequency of singlets and pairs of residues in the gene; the phylogeny ( X  X amily tree X ) of the organism from which each protein was obtained -from SWISS-PROT [3] (a standard protein database); SWISS-PROT protein keywords (membrane, transmembrane, inner_membrane, outer_membrane, repeat, plasmid, and alternative_splicing); and the length and molecular weight of the gene. This description resembles a  X  X hylogenic profile X  [17], but is more general and expressive. In total 5,895,649 facts were generated. Table 2 shows the available database facts and their description. protein functional class from sequence description. This was done using a combination of clustering and rule learning (see Figure 2). other scientific discovery tasks [9]. It is powerful because clustering improves the representation for learning (using the expressive power of inductive logic programming  X  ILP [19]), and discrimination efficiently exploits the pre-labeled examples. WARMR [9] is an ILP data mining algorithm that is used to identify frequent patterns (conjunctive queries) in the sequence descriptions. In this experiment roughly 18,000 frequent queries were discovered. These were converted into 18,000 Boolean specific gene if the corresponding query su cceeds for that gene. Conversely, if the query fails, the corresponding attribute is assigned value 0. used to induce rules that predict function from the attributes. Good rules were selected on a validation set, and the unbiased accuracy of these rules estimated on a test set. Rules were selected to balance accuracy with unidentified gene coverage. In general the correct balance of accuracy and coverage for any particular application depends on the relative cost of making errors of commission and omission [25] (making incorrect predictions v missing genes). The system can be tuned to select 
Table 2. The number of rules found are those selected on the validation set. A rule predicts more than one homology class if there is more than one sequence similarity cluster in the correct test predictions. A rule predicts a new homology class if there is a sequence similarity cluster in the test predictions that has no members in the training data. Average test accuracy is the accuracy of the predictions on the test proteins of assigned function (if conflicts occur, the prediction with the highest a priori probability is chosen). Default test accuracy is the accuracy that could be achieved by always selecting the most populous class.  X  X ew functions assigned X  is the number of genes of unassigned function predicted.

Then the ORF has the functional class  X  X acromolecule metabolism  X  different balances. The prediction rules were then applied to genes that have not been assigned a function. sequence at all levels of the functional hierarchies, as shown in Table 2. chance. Of the genes originally in the  X  X onserved Hypothetical X  or  X  X nknown X  function classes, 985 (65%) were predicted to have a function at one or more levels of the hierarchy. The rule learning http://www.aber.ac.uk/~dcswww/Research/bio/ProteinFunction/. TB_C50_1_26 shown in figure 3. (the probability of this result occurring by chance is estimated at examples). The rule correctly predicts the following proteins (rpsG (S7), rpsI (S9), rpsL (S12), rpsT (S20), rplJ (L10), rplP (L16), rplS (L19), rplX (L24), rpmE (L31), rpmJ (L36), infC (IF-3)). These proteins are all involved in protein translation. When the training data are included the rule covers 46 out of the 58 proteins known to be involved in ribosomal protein synthesis and modification. The two errors (of commission) made in the test data were groEL2 a  X 60 kD Chaperonin 2 gene X  and Rv3583c a  X  X utative transcriptional regulator X . The rule predicts the function of five genes classed as  X  X onserved Hypotheticals X  (Rv566, Rv854, Rv910, Rv2185, Rv2708) and ten genes classed as  X  X nknowns X  (Rv123, Rv810, Rv909, Rv1893, Rv1955, Rv2061, Rv2517, Rv2819, Rv2822, Rv3718). The prediction rule is consistent with protein chemistry, as lysine is positively charged which is desirable for interaction with negatively charged RNA. The choice of lysine over arginine for the positively charged residue may be connected with the high GC content of the M. tuberculosis genome [8] -lysine is coded by the codons AAA and AAG; while arg is coded by CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG; and his by CAT and CAC. complex rule is shown in figure 4. This rule predicts the level two functional class  X  X egradation of macromolecules X . The rule is 62.5% accurate (5/8) on the test set. It predicts 3 genes, which are currently classified as  X  X nknown X  or  X  X onserved Hypothetical X . The errors of commission are rplV (synthesis and modification of macromolecules), Rv1566 (Virulence) and ponA2 (penicillin binding protein). systematically find rules not based on homology. To show this we carried out all-against-all PSI-BLAST searches for those proteins correctly predicted by each rule. If all the proteins could be linked together by PSI-BLAST scores &lt; 10 then the proteins were considered homologous. It was found that many of the predictive rules were more general than possible using sequence homology. 
If there exists a homologous protein in SwissProt with the keyword "membrane" and there exists a homologous protein in Bacillus subtilis and there does not exist a homologous protein with very low molecular weight, a large percentage of glutamic acid, and medium sequence similarity and there does not exist a homologous protein in SwissProt with good sequence similarity, low percentage of cysteine, the keyword "transmembrane" and a fairly high molecular weight there does not exist a firmicutes sp. protein in SwissProt with the keyword "transmembrane", with medium molecular weight, and a very high amount of low entropy sequence and there exists a homologous mammalian protein in 
SwissProt with the keyword "repeat" with very high molecular weight 
Then the ORF has the functional class "Degradation of macromolecules". This was shown in two ways: the rules correctly predict the function of sets of proteins that are not homologous to each other, and they correctly predict the function of proteins that are not homologous to any in the training data (Table 1). Such rules provide a way of predicting function in the absence of recognisable sequence homology . The other rules, those of equal power to sequence homology, are also valuable as they provide a novel way of detecting homology. predictions that are useful in determining the functions of genes of currently unknown function, and they provide evolutionary insight. The actual function of a gene can only be determined by  X  X et X  experiment. However, bioinformatic techniques such as sequence homology detection, and the prediction rules presented here, can make such experimental determination simpler. It is clearly more efficient to test a high probability hypothesis than to randomly test for possible functions. We look forward to the testing of our predictions by other workers, and we are designing automatic methods to test the rules ourselves. function raises the question of their evolutionary causation. How are such rules possible, given the notoriously complicated mappings between function and structure, and structure and sequence? Several possibilities exist: the rules are paralogous [16] with homology so distant as to be undetectable by sequence analysis; convergent evolution has occurred, forcing proteins with similar function to resemble each other; or horizontal evolution has transferred functional related groups of protein into the organisms. Evidence in favour of a role for distant homology is that it is possible to predict function better than random based on predicted secondary structure alone, and secondary structure is better conserved over evolution than sequence [22]. Evidence against this is that we have found little evidence for common SCOP database [21]  X  X uperfamily X  and  X  X old X  classifications for proteins predicted by the same rule. Convergent evolution seems to be the dominant factor in rules such as TB_C50_1_26 (Figure 3). Evidence for horizontal transfer of genes into M. tuberculosis is the importance of phylogeny in many rules where a paralogous explanation seems to be ruled out. discovery techniques by showing that they can discover prediction rules that are effective and of biological interest in functional genomics. The data mining approach described is extendable to analysis of other forms of bioinformatic data, such as expression profiles, pathway analysis, structural studies, etc. [10,27,17,6]. Information from all these diverse approaches will be able to be combined together to produce more powerful predictions than any single one in isolation. from IBS and Mohammed Ouali from Computer Science, at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth; Ashwin Srinivasan of the Computing Laboratory at the University of Oxford; and Steffen Schulze-Kremer at the Resource Centre of the German Human Genome Project for helpful discussions.
