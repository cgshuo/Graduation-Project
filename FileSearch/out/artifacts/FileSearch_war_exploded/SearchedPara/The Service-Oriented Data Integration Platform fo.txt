The data resources needed by water resources management has the following char-and close relates with region services: z Distributed: the data resources needed by water resources management distribute z Multi-sources: the data resources needed by water resources management come integration can X  X  satisfy these requests at one time. This paper advances an approach of data resources integrated in water resources management based on SOA. vanced the concept of federated database system based on multi-database integration systems that are autonomous and possibly heterogeneous[1]. This method can X  X  real-ize data integration of non-database. database, legacy system, web data, and etc. Mediated consists of mediator and wrap-per[2][3]. The mediator is a software component that mediates between the user and physical data source, can process and execute queries over data stored locally and in cal data source into global model. Along with development of middleware technology roundings. But the mediated only realizes read of data because physical data sources are autonomous. zation of data, and satisfy user X  X  individuation need[6]. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an evolution of the Component Based Archi-1990s. Service Oriented Architecture is an architectural paradigm for components of a system and interactions or patterns between them. A component offers a service that waits in a state of readiness. Other components may invoke the service in compliance with a service contract[7]. 
Most of architectures that are called SOA include a service provider, a service con-between the service provider and service consumer are implied. A software architect signed an application that is compliant with an SOA. 
Web Services is a specific of SOA implementations that embody the core aspects Model. 4.1 The Architecture of Platform This section describes the architecture depicted in Figure 1.The platform is based on sources user and platform manager correspond with service provider, service consume platform. 4.2 Metadata how objects relate to each other. The metadata is a foundation of data resources inte-gration platform, looked upon global as view of data resources called. 
Now many water resources management departments have achieved database de-cessed easily. 4.3 UDDI Registration Center managing all kind of service components. Now there are many products and opening code of UDDI. 4.4 Service Compon ent for Data Called service-oriented data integration framework. It is the service component what can be used by legal user. 
This service component can be called by legal user directly, can compose more big service component for data called, and can be called by operation application system on upper layer. 4.5 Service Component for User Calling must be publised on UDDI registration center If it need be used by other. 4.6 The Function of Platform 4.6.1 Metadata Manager The metadata manager realizes management of metadata in platform. It includes add, sent to correlative service provider. 4.6.2 Service Called Manager ning, intervenes deviant action, manages service called, and so on. 4.6.3 Service Created service created and service maintained. one data table or multi-data tables. If data come from multi-data table primary key and relation between multi-data table must be defined. vice components for data called. 4.6.4 Service Published The service published publishes service had created using UDDI. Service component owner authorizes to user who can calls the service component, publishes service com-of service component. service components needing be published, these service component has created using service created. Then he select users who can call service component from user data-base for every service component. 
Second is published of service component. Service component owner publishes these service components to UDDI business registration center using UDDI. 4.6.5 Service Customized The service customized is core realizing active service. Data resources user can cus-pushed, and etc. define format of data shown, model of data pushed, frequency of data pushed, and etc based on upper definition. 4.6.6 Service Called call data. 
The way of service called has three. First is that user selects service component for user calling defined by service customized, and calls data through service component definition at service customized. The data called by user can be printed, stored, and so on. these data resources and which authorities are allowed using function of platform.The function of service customized provided by platform can push data resources to user, provides active service.
