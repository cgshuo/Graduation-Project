 1. Introduction
Induction machine models used for the solution of a variety of steady-state problems require equivalent circuit parameters. These parameters include the resistances and reactances repre-senting the stator, rotor and magnetizing branches. The main problem of induction motor parameter estimation is the unavail-ability of manufacturer data to construct accurate models. Due to this reason, the induction motor models are not explicitly represented in various applications.

The conventional technique for estimating the induction motor parameters are based on the no-load and the locked-rotor tests (Say, 1983 ). However, these approaches cannot be implemented motor be locked. In the locked-rotor condition, the frequency of the rotor is equal to the supply frequency, but under typical operations, the rotor frequency is perhaps 1 X 3Hz. This incorrect rotor frequency will give misleading results for the locked-rotor test. Classical approach with linear squares has been implemented to identify machine parameters ( Koubaa, 2004 ; Stephan et al., 1994 ). The linear parameter estimation techniques have been used to determine the rotor resistance, rotor self-inductance and the stator leakage inductance of a three-phase induction machine. The problem has also been solved with more sophisticated approach for non-linear system identification ( Wang et al., 2005 ). A complete survey on various approaches to machine parameter estimation has been presented ( Toliyat et al., 2003 ).
A simple method for determining squirrel cage induction motor parameters and problems in the determination of para-meters with the two methods proposed in IEEE standard 112 was discussed ( Pedra and Sainz, 2006 ). The single cage rotor was modeled with a double cage rotor to predict the starting current and the torque manufacturer data, and the circuit parameters were calculated from the data of the three tests: no-load, locked-rotor and over load tests. The method had the advantage of not requiring torque measurements. The mathematical method for estimating the equivalent circuit parameters of induction ma-chines from the most available performance characteristics was presented ( Ansuj et al., 1989 ; Pedra and Corcoles, 2004 ). This method utilizes machine equations to estimate the parameters and sensitivity analysis with respect to the circuit parameters is done to match the given performance characteristics. A new parameter estimation method for induction motors has been presented ( Lindenmeyer et al., 2001 ). In this method, the double cage induction motor was modeled from the manufacturer data such as the name plate data and the motor performance characteristics. Johnson and Willis (1991) and Cirrincione et al. (2003) have applied deterministic approaches to the parameter estimation problem with some success, although with the inherent problem of convergence to a local optimum instead of the global minimum. The optimum determined by these techni-ques depends heavily on the initial guess of the parameter, with the possibility of a slightly different initial value causing the algorithm to converge to an entirely different solution ( Pillay et al., 1997 ; Nangsue et al., 1999 ). Some approaches require derivative of the function, which is not always available or may be difficult to calculate. Due to these reasons, deterministic approaches often cannot find optimal solutions when dealing with non-linear systems.
 evolutionary algorithm ( Nangsue et al., 1999 ), genetic algorithm Rahimpour et al., 2007 ; Huang et al., 2001 ; Nollan et al., 1994 ;
Orlowska Kowalska et al., 2006 ), adaptive GA ( Abdelhadi et al., 2004 ) and differential evolution ( Ursem and Vadstrup, 2003 )have been proposed to solve the parameter estimation problems. solve complex non-linear optimization problems, recent research has identified some deficiencies in GA performance ( Fogel, 2000 ).
This degradation in efficiency is apparent when the parameters being optimized are highly correlated and the premature convergence of the GA degrades its performance in terms of reducing the search capability of GA.

Eberhart, is one of the modern heuristic algorithms. It was developed through simulation of a simplified social system and has been found to be robust in solving non-linear problems (Eberhart and Kennedy, 1995 ; Shi and Eberhart, 1998, 1999 ). The
PSO technique can generate high-quality solutions with minimum computation time and stable convergence characteristic than the other stochastic methods ( Eberhart and Shi, 1998 ; Angeline, 1998 ; Gaing, 2003 ; Poli et al., 2007 ).
 multi-objective parameter estimation to minimize the deviation between estimated and manufacturer data. The equivalent circuit parameters of the approximate, exact and deep bar circuit models are estimated using PSO technique. The no-load, locked-rotor and stator resistance tests are conducted on the test machines in order to compute their parameters traditionally (classical parameter estimation method). The validity of the proposed method is tested on two motors. The results obtained using GA and classical parameter estimation methods are also provided for comparing the performance of the proposed method. 2. Sensitivity analysis parameters that have the most impact on motor performance.
The reason is that the process of motor manufacturing is not consistent and this causes significant variations between the actual parameter values and the manufacturer values. Such variations cause deviations in the motor performance, which lead to operational problems. By using sensitivity analysis, the significance of parameters on the motor performance can be easily observed.

The values of the circuit parameters used for the evaluation on the sensitivity factors are the parameters obtained from the PSO method. The expression for the normalized sensitivity or sensitivity factor is
Where Y represents the motor performance variables such as the starting torque, the maximum torque, the full load torque, the and b represents the circuit model parameters. 3. Problem formulation circuit model, an exact circuit model or a deep bar circuit model [16]. The parameter estimation problem is formulated as a least squares optimization problem, the objective being the minimiza-tion of deviation between the estimated and the manufacturer data. The problem formulation for the parameter estimation of three different induction motor models is described below. 3.1. Approximate circuit model formulation imum torque and the full load torque manufacturer data to estimate the stator resistance, the rotor resistance and the stator leakage reactance parameters. The magnetizing reactance para-meter ( X m ) is not considered in this model. The approximate circuit model of the induction motor is shown in Fig. 1 . The objective function and associated constraints of the problem are formulated as follows: 3.1.1. Objective function where f 1  X  f 2  X  f  X  K  X  Where  X  X f X  stands for the manufacturer. T fl (mf), T lr (mf) and T max (mf) are the manufacturer values of the full load torque, the locked-rotor torque and the maximum torque, respectively. 3.1.2.

The problem formulation uses the starting torque, the max-imum torque, the full load torque and the full load power factor manufacturer data to estimate the stator resistance, the rotor resistance, the stator leakage reactance, the rotor leakage reactance and the magnetizing leakage reactance parameters. Equivalent circuit representing the steady-state operation of a poly-phase induction motor is shown in Fig. 2 . The mathematical formulation is as follows: 3.2.1.

Overview of particle swarm optimization swarming behaviors observed in flock of birds, school of fishes or swarm of bees, in which the intelligence is emerged. It was developed in 1995 by James Kennedy and Russell Eberhart and uses a number of particles that constitute a swarm moving around in an N -dimensional search space looking for the best solution.
Each particle in PSO keep track of its co-ordinates in the problem space, which are associated with the best solution (best fitness) it has achieved so far. This value is called pbest. Another  X  X  X est X  X  value that is tracked by the global version of the particle swarm optimizer is the overall best value and its location obtained so far by any particle in the swarm. This location is called gbest. information: particle toward its pbest and gbest locations at each iteration.
Acceleration is weighted by a random term, with separate random number generating for acceleration toward pbest and gbest locations. The general flow chart of PSO is shown in Fig. 4 . X
Let X and V denote the particle X  X  position and its corresponding position of each particle in the next iteration can be calculated as V  X  gbest n X k i ; n  X  X  5  X  i  X  1 ; 2 ... ; m n  X  1 ; 2 ... N X where m is the number of particles in the swarm; N is the number of dimensions in a particle; K is the pointer of iterations the weighting factor; C j is the acceleration factor; rand random number between 0 and 1; X in k is the current position of gbest is the global best of the group.

In the above procedures, the convergence speed of each particle could be influenced by the parameters of acceleration factors C 1 and C 2 . The optimization process will modify the other hand, the optimization process can become unstable, if the is the initial velocity of particle, which reflects the memory behavior of particle; the second term  X  X  X ognition part X  X , which represents the private thinking of the particle itself and the third part is the  X  X  X ocial X  X  part, which shows the particles behavior stem from the experience of other particles in the population. The following weighting function is usually used in (5) W  X  W max  X  W max W min  X  Iter = Iter max  X  7  X  Where W max and W min are the initial and the final weight, respectively, Iter is the current iteration number and Iter maximum iteration number. The model using (7) is called the  X  X nertia weights approach (IWA) X . The inertia weight is employed to control the impact of the previous history of velocities on the current velocity. Thus, the parameter W regulates the trade-off between the global and the local exploration abilities of the swarm. A large inertia weight facilitates exploration, while a small one tends to facilitate exploitation. 5. Development of the proposed method
In this paper, the process to solve a constrained multi-objective parameter estimation using a PSO technique was developed to obtain efficiently a high-quality solution. The PSO technique was used to determine the optimal equivalent circuit parameters of the induction motor, thus minimizing the error between the estimated and the manufacturer data. Before employing the PSO method to solve the parameter estimation problem, three definitions must be made. 5.1. Representation of individual string
For an efficient evolutionary method, the representation of chromosome strings of the problem parameter set is important. In this paper, we adopted the circuit model parameters as a gene, and many genes comprise an individual. Each individual within the population represents a candidate solution for solving the multi-objective parameter estimation problem. For example, if  X  m  X  particles are used to find the optimal solutions, then the i th particle  X  X i  X  can be defined as follows: X  X  X  X i ; 1 ; X i ; 2 ... X i ; N ; i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; m where  X  m  X  represents the population size, N is the no. of parameters and X i,N is the N th parameter value at i th particle. The dimension of a population is m N . These genes in each individual are represented as real values. The matrix representa-tion of a population is as follows: Table 1 5.2. Evaluation function
When PSO is applied for the solution of an optimization problem, the fitness function that compares different candidate solutions and directs the algorithmic search must be defined. In this work, an individual that provides less error deviation between the estimated and the manufacturer data represents a better candidate solution. So, the evaluation function can be expressed as follows: F  X  min Where F is the fitness value; f i is the squared error function in Eqs. (2) X (4) for the approximate circuit model, the exact circuit model and the deep bar circuit model, respectively and S denotes available manufacturer data.

 6. Simulation results
The proposed PSO technique for multi-objective parameter estimation algorithm is tested on 5 and 40HP motors using three different circuit models. Table 2 gives the manufacturer data of the test motors. A comparative study with GA was done to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. PSO and GA parameters used for the simulation are summarized in Table 3 . For the implementation of PSO, several parameters are required to factor ( W ), swarm size and termination criteria. These parameters should be selected carefully for efficient performance of PSO. The constants C 1 and C 2 represent the weighting of the stochastic acceleration terms that pull each particle toward pbest and gbest positions. Low values allow particles to roam far from the target regions before being tugged back. On the other hand, high values result in abrupt movement toward, or past, target regions. Hence the acceleration constants were often set to be 2.0 according to the past experiences. Suitable selection of weighting factor ( W ) provides a balance between the global and the local explorations, thus requiring less iteration on average to find a sufficiently optimal solution. As originally developed, W often decreases linearly from about 0.9 to 0.4 during the run ( Eberhart and Kennedy, 1995 ; Gaing, 2003 ). The swarm size and maximum number of generations are fixed by trial and error method. The optimization procedure is terminated when there is no change in the result for 50 consecutive generations or when 200 generations are reached, whichever occurs first.

To validate and compare the results obtained by the PSO algorithm, the equivalent circuit parameters are also estimated from traditional no-load and locked-rotor tests, which are termed as classical parameter estimation method. The results of PSO and GA that follow are the best solution over 20 independent trials. 6.1. Case study
The torque errors obtained from different circuit models and techniques are compared in Tables 4 and 5 for motors 1and 2, respectively. Between PSO and GA methods, the magnitudes of the torque errors obtained using the PSO method are comparatively lesser than those using the GA method. The results of the classical parameter estimation method using exact circuit model are presented in Table 6 . It can be observed that the PSO method performs better than the classical parameter estimation method.
The equivalent circuit parameters obtained from various methods for the approximate, exact and deep bar circuit models of the test motors are presented in Tables 7 X 9 , respectively.
 results of the torque and line current characteristics for motors 1 and 2, respectively. The PSO-based parameter estimation of deep bar circuit model results are in good agreement in all slip regions with the manufacturer values as shown in the figures. The torque error of this model for motor 1 has the following values: 3.6% at the starting point, 5% at the maximum torque point and 4% at thec full torque point.
 fitness value with PSO and GA for the best run out of 20 trials of motors 1 and 2 are shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. It can be observed that the fitness value reduces over the iterations and converges to a minimum value. 6.2. Sensitivity analysis results mance variables with respect to each of the equivalent circuit parameters are determined by varying the value of one parameter at a time by 1%. The parameters obtained from the PSO method current, power factor, efficiency, starting torque, maximum torque and starting current with respect to the exact circuit model parameters and the deep bar circuit model parameters have been calculated at the rated capacity for the 5HP motor. The sensitivity analysis results are presented in Figs. 9 and 10.
 resistances reduce the stator current. Therefore, the sensitivity and stator leakage reactance. Magnetizing reactance has con-siderable effect on the power factor. The sensitivity of power sensitivity factor of maximum torque with respect to stator resistance and stator reactance has higher values. Rotor resistance has no influence on the maximum torque. The rotor resistance and the stator leakage reactance parameters affect the starting torque significantly. 6.3. Comparative studies 6.3.1. Solution quality
As seen in Figs. 11 (a) and 12(a), the PSO method has the minimum fitness value than the GA method, thus resulting in a higher quality solution. The PSO method converges earlier than the GA method as shown in Figs. 8 and 9 . Hence the PSO method has better solution quality and convergence characteristics. 6.3.2. Robustness
In order to verify the robustness of the proposed methodology, simulations are carried out for 20 independent runs. Figs. 11 (b) and 12(b) show the standard deviation results for different models and techniques. It can be seen that the PSO method is more robust than the GA. The standard deviation of the fitness values for 20 runs is very low in the PSO method. 6.3.3. Immunity to the initial population
The effect of initial population on the final solution for five trials of motor 1 is shown in Fig. 13 . It can be observed that even though the convergence is different for different populations, the PSO algorithm converges to the global solution. It is found that the PSO method is less sensitive to the initial population. 7. Conclusion
A particle swarm optimization method-based multi-objective parameter estimation of three different induction motor models has been proposed. The problem is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem. To verify the feasibility, the proposed PSO method has been evaluated on 5 and 40HP motors and the results were compared with the GA and the classical parameter estimation method. The PSO method has been found to be more robust as it gives minimum standard deviation than the GA method. By analyzing the results, it can be observed that the parameter estimation using PSO method gives better results than the other techniques. The manufacturer data is getting obsolete as the motor is getting old and therefore, the proposed estimation method is not reliable after a while. This is a disadvantage of the proposed estimation method. The parameters, which have the most impact on motor performance were also found by sensitivity analysis. This analysis provides information about parameters that affect the performance of the motor. Though applied to induction motor, this PSO-based estimation method is generally applicable to other complicated non-linear systems.
