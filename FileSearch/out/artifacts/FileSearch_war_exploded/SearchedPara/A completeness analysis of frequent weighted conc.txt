Depending on the number of nodes in X , we have two situations: (1) If there exists only one node h w in X ; obviously  X  X = h (2) If the total number of nodes of X is greater than or equal to two ( i) For any two nodes, there exists the partial order relation in X , i.e., for any h ii) For some part of nodes, there exists the partial order relation in X . XM , and the existence of the infimum of XN .
 If there is only one node in XM ( XN ), the node is the supremum (infimum) of XM ( XN ). MaxC ( XN ) cannot be empty.

Suppose that the total number of nodes of MinP ( XM )isgreaterthanorequaltotwo( concept lattice is complete as well. Therefore, in WCL, there must exist one node h h w j  X  XM p L w ,and h w j  X   X  Min P( XM ) p L w ,wehave h lattice).

FWCL (from Definition 6 , h w is a frequent node or a virtual node). From h from h w  X  h w j  X  , we follow that h w is the supremum of XM ,thatis, MinP ( XM )={ h
Example 2. Referring to Fig. 7 , let us suppose that X ={#3, #2, #8, #13}, then {#6, #8}, then MinP ( XM )={#2},  X  X =#2, and XN ={#6, #8}, MaxC ( XN )={#13},

Proposition 2. For any h w1 and h w2 ,h w1 =( A 1 , B 1 , w the frequent infimum and supremum; furthermore, h w1  X  h w2 supremum of h w1 and h w2 .

Proof. (1) if h w1  X  h w2 , we have h w2 as the frequent supremum of h (2) if h w1  X  h w2 , we have h w1 as the frequent supremum of h (3) if B 1  X  B 2  X  B 1 or B 2 ; that is, there exists no partial order relation between h i) if weight ( B 1  X  B 2 )  X   X  , from Definition 3 , we follow f ( g ( B
Suppose there exists h w4 =( A 4 , B 4 , w 4 )  X  P 1  X  P 2 and B 4 p B 1  X  B 2 ; furthermore, since h w4  X  h w3 , we have B supremum of h w1 and h w2 ; moreover, it is unique.

Likewise, we have h w1  X  ( h w2  X  h w3 )  X  ( h w1  X  h w2 )
Similarly, we can prove that ( h w1  X  h w2 )  X  h w3 = h w1
Example 7. As it can be seen from Fig. 7 , we consider h w1 #12  X  #6=#12, #11  X  (#13  X  #6)=#11  X  #6=#12, i.e. (#11  X  #13) Proposition 5. Operators  X  and  X  satisfy laws of commutativity, idempotency law and absorption.

Similarly, we can prove that h w1  X  ( h w1  X  h w2 )= h w1
Proposition 6. Operators  X  and  X  satisfy distributive inequality, that is for any h h  X  ( h w2  X  h w3 )  X  ( h w1  X  h w2 )  X  ( h w1  X  h w3 ) and h
