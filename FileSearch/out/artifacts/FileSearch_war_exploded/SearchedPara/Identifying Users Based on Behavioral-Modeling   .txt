 Online social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Sina Weibo own thousands of millions users. The recent investigation shows that Facebook, the most popular social media site, has more than 1 billion users. Also, those users create huge information: over 500 million tweets are posted on Twitter [2] . It is a very convenient and anywhere. Obviously, every social medi a site has their own specificity and people use various social media sites for different purposes [1] . Identification of users across and terrorists have their own social network accounts, which provide a great opportu-find their hidden accounts. 
Identifying across social media sites is a challenging problem due to the hetero-geneity and uncertainty of data. The information provided by users like usernames, relationships between user identities across social media sites are usually unavailable. It is not a straightforward task to find a mapping between two users among huge in-formation redundancy. 
In this paper, we introduce a behavior-modeling identification method to detect us-ers in different sites. It is said  X  X ld habits, die hard X  and we focus on those behavior ideas are as follow: 1) Build a behavior-modeling. 2) Propose a fast exclusion method and provide an algorithm to determine the difference of two users. Some existing work focusing on identification has been presented. We summarized research related to identifying individuals acr oss social media sites. There is a related research about identifying contents produced by an individual on the web. In [3] the authors take eyes on the contents generation behavior of the same individuals X  for the vidual across different documents. They use a method based on Normalized Com-pression Distance (NCD) [4] to compare the similarity between the documents. There are some machine learning techniques employed to determine authors in online mes-sages [6]. The content based on textual is also has been studied [9,10]. The paper [7] methodology to identify users by detecting their usernames based on behavior fea-tures. They considered human being X  X  limitations in times, memory and knowledge. They constructed features by the information of human behavioral patterns and em-ployed a machine learning method for users X  identification across social media sites. sites. They analyzed the user-contributed web data and constructed the information oped techniques for identifying earthquake events. In this paper, we focus on the simi-larity of behaviors that individuals performed in different social media sites, which is important to avoid making mistakes on identity determination. their real identities and social media sites rarely have identity authentication systems. A large amount of users provide false information such as incorrect names, age, pro-fession and even incorrect gender to hide their privacy. consistent behavioral patterns. It is necessary that an individual will keep their reality behavioral patterns [8] in the virtual life on the internet. The behavioral information can contribute to identify individuals across social media sites. We analyze the infor-mation available on all social media sites. 
There are some public figures that hold accounts authenticated by social media sites. Those famous figures include actors, athletes, politicians and entrepreneurs. The remarks from famous accounts are much more widely spread than the regular users. Obviously most of the famous users have certain labels. It is easier to identify a regu-tures. There is an example if a user follows Kobe Bryant (e.g. his label is basketball player, Los Angles Lakers) and re-posts his tweets, we will give the user such labels, interests on basketball and maybe a supporter of Kobe Bryant and Los Angles Lakers. 
A regular user will follow a number of public accounts and connect them. Connec-re-posts action, comments and mentions (like @ function in Twitter). From those connections, we can give a behavioral-modeling for regular user. u ( 1&lt;i&lt;n ) is a factor of U . 
When considering behavioral-modeling, two general problems need to be solved for user identification. The first problem is: Given two users and all their media action information ( U 1 and U 2 ), how to determine whether they belong to the same individu-larity S is decided by function about U 1 and U 2 . 
We can identify users across media sits by determination of their similarity. There is a threshold l . So we can get: dant information on the across media sites. We provide a fast exclusion method. The two users belong to one individual. 4.1 Fast Exclusion Method As human beings, we have some behavior limitations. Behavior limitations include: 1) If an event has two antagonistic attitudes, people will often choose one side, posi-receive information from the sources doesn X  X  like. 3) Because of the energy limitation, change no matter which social network platforms the individual uses. Based on the behavior limitations, the Exclusion Method consist two components. The first component aims to find the antagonistic factors of two users. 
We firstly build a library to list the antagonistic factors, e.g., {Los Angeles Lakers supporter and Los Angeles clippers supporters, the fans of Real Madrid and Barcelo-na, Republican surrounded and Democrats surrounded, Jewish believers and Mus-lims} p are not the same individual. 
The second component is based on limitation 3. We believe that if two users in dif-that they both have. It means: there are behaviors features of two users U 1 and U 2 , if they belong to the same individual, we can know: 12 UU  X  X  X  X  and ()/() UU UU  X   X  X  X  X  . 12 () UU  X  is the common interests of two users and () UU  X  is the complete interests of two users. The  X  is the minimum common probability of identification. The value of  X  is picked by experience. The false alarm will increase when  X  is higher or otherwise, the undetected value will increase. 4.2 Behavior-Modeling Identification Algorithm The fast exclusion method can exclude apparent different users. But it is hard to iden-consider the users they connect. The excl usion method doesn X  X  consider how many define the connected users as nodes and the time of connections are edge weights. It forms a network its structure shown in Fig.1. The core nodes (with high weight edges) represent the core interests which have closer relationship with the user. 
If the two users belong to the same individual, they will have analogous core nodes the same nodes and edges (the edge weights are different), the two vectors have iden-tical length. The difference of two network structure can be measured by Kullback-Liebler divergence (KL). KL is a non-symmetric measure of the difference between two probability distributions. 
For two vectors 12 {p , p ,..., p } n P = and 12 {q , q ,..., q } n Q = ,we can get: It is the expectation of the logarithmic difference between the probabilities P and Q, where the expectation is taken using the probability P. 
When two probability distributions are completely same (x) Q(x) P = , the (P || Q) D is zero. So it means the value of D is smaller and the two probability distri-butions are more similar. Using the algorithm, we can obtain a measurement to possible to find the most similar user from other group of users. We evaluate our behavior-modeling identification method using data from several the privacy of users, the private information like usernames and ids has been hidden. We did two different experiments: 1. Comparing the similarity of one user behavior similarity with different periods of 2. Evaluating the similarity between two given users across the social media sites. 5.1 The First Experiment In the first experiment, we want to ensure users on social media sites have stable be-havior performance. We can compare the similarity of one user behavior with differ-between November 26, 2013 and March 15, 2014 on Twitter. We divided the data into 8 periods and each period is 10 days. E ach period length is one month. We used the Twitter API to collect the user behaviors information including: Tweets and re-tweets, mentions users and their connection times. We calculate the difference value between one period and the previous period. The similarity result is shown in Table1. one user X  X  behavior is very similar in different priod of time. 5.2 The Second Experiment A simple method for identifying usernames across sites is by finding users manually. Users sometimes provide some personal information such as their real names, E-mail employed to map users on different sites to the same individual. And we choose some volunteers to share their accounts on different social network. pairs X  accounts include volunteers X  accounts and accounts confirmed by artificial. The dataset is from Twitter and Sina Weibo, which called dataset 1. We also pick another comparative dataset 2. 
We firstly use the fast exclusion method to exclude the different users and the re-sults are shown below. Different pairs of accounts 27 795 
We can calculate the recall rate is: 79.5% and accurate rate is 96.7%. It proves the accuracy of the fast exclusion method is high and the method is effective. 
After the fast exclusion method, dataset 1 left 213 pairs of accounts and dataset 2 left 205 pairs of accounts. We secondly use the behavior-modeling identification algorithm to acquire the difference values of those pairs. 
Table 3 illustrates that the difference values of dataset 1 are much lower than val-same individual is picked by experience. If we set the threshold at 0.6, we can acquire the final results that we judged whether the pairs belong to same individual. From Table 4, we can calculate the recall rate is: 88.7% and accurate rate is 98.1%. It illustrates the behavior-modeling identification algorithm is effective. 
Fig.2(a) shows the histogram of dataset 1. The difference of users belong to same The experiments illustrate three conclusions: 1) The first experiment result shows that 2) The fast exclusion method can effectively exclude different users across social media sites. 3) The behavior-modeling identification algorithm do well in identifying the users across the social media sites. In this paper, we have demonstrated a method for identifying users in different social media sites. The method is based on behavioral modeling approach. The information employed by our method is available on social media sites. Users will keep their ex-exclusion method and provide a similarity to determine whether the users are belong to the same individual. The two experiments demonstrate that our method is effective. 
There are other studies on users X  behavior patterns; we can do the research on us-and studying the multiple methods proved mutually.
