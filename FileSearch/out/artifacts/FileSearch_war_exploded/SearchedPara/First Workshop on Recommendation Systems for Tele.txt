At any given moment, a costumer has hundreds to thousands of automatic, personalized recomme ndations desirable to help consumers deal with the often overwhelming choices they face. TV and online video recommendation systems face a number of constantly changing and often only available once, which leads to severe cold start problems. Frequently, we also consume our entertainment in groups of consumer behavior very challenging, Recommendation systems for tele vision and online video also have to address a number of very different consumption patterns, such as actively browsing through a list of personalized Video on Demand choices that match our current mood, compared to enjoying a  X  X ean back experience X  where a recommendation channels for us. recommender systems in this domain motivated us to organize this workshop to bring together researchers from industry and academy in order to identify and share the key challenges, approaches and solutions of the field. The objective of this workshop is to encourage discussions among the researchers in the field, disseminate the latest approaches and workshop activities and hopefully this will accelerate progress towards creating better recomme ndation systems for television and online video in the future. researchers on novel approaches to challenges found in the TV and online video recommendations space.
