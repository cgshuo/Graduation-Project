 Conventional wisdom suggests that th ere are benefits to the creation of shared repositories of scientif ic data. Funding agencies require that the data from sponsored projects be shared publicly, but individual researchers often see little personal benefit to offset the work of creating easily sharable data. These conflicting forces have led to the emergence of a new role to support researchers: data managers. This paper identifies ke y differences between the socio-technical context of data managers and other  X  X uman infrastructure X  roles articulated previously in Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) literature and summarizes the challenges that data managers face when accepting data for archival and reuse. While data managers X  work is critical for advancing science and science policy, their work is often invisible and under-appreciated since it takes place behind the scenes. K.4.3 [ Organizational Impacts ]: Computer-supported collaborative work; H.3.5 [ Online Information Services ]: Data sharing Keywords: Cyberinfrastructure, data managers. Conventional wisdom suggests that th ere are benefits to the creation of shared repositories of scien tific data. For example, Earth observation data are critical to deepen our understanding of factors and processes controlling life on Earth and for use by policy makers, resource managers and others to make decisions that affect sustainability of life within a context of global change and increasing population [9,10]. Recognition of these advantages to archiving data has led the NI H, NSF, and NASA to require researchers to submit data manage ment plans that include whether and how data will be made available publically [16,17,18]. Given the importance of data shar ing, reuse, and integration and synthesis, an open question is why are we not advancing more rapidly to the promise of fully cu rated, metadata-complete, publicly-accessible repositories [8]. At first glance, it would seem that the influence of grant agencies and publication venues would force more widespread data deposition. Certainly, international and US agencies have implemented data sharing practices that are partially effective. A deeper look reveals that researchers X  data practices, including data sharing, are more often guided by individual benefit [11]. The reality is that many researchers do not budget adequate time for metadata generation, and pe rceive that this task is not a high priority. Nor are researchers compensated for producing data products X  X hey are evaluated for advancing science through research publications. Data repositories have emerged as a key enabling infrastructure to mediate these opposing forces by providing organized, indexed, and well-documented data products that are easily found and independently understandable [5, 14]. Some repositories have addressed the issue of individual be nefit by treating data publication as another form of peer-reviewed journal publication, such as the Ecological Society of America (ESA) Ecological Archives and Scientific Data from Nature Publication Group. Even when researchers gain professional recognition through peer-reviewed data publication, many data collection activities are not targeted for archives, and often the resulting data products are not well documented or formatted for others to use [12]. Data managers help to bridge this gap between data creators and data users by creating clear and understandable data documentation. Data managers must successfully straddle multiple worlds. First, they must be up to date with the technical aspects of data archives. Second, they must maintain an in-depth knowledge of advances in data curation, and preservation since a key service of data centers is supporting long-term access and use of the data stored in the repository. In addition, just as res earch librarians have expertise in their client X  X  disciplines, so should data managers [15].  X  X uman infrastructure X  was described by Lee, et al. as the social context that enables and sustains the work of creating and maintaining cyberinfrastructure (CI) [13]. Lee, et al. further articulate the importance of human infrastructure to the process of creating a data sharing infrastructur e, namely data repositories. The key to maintaining data repositories is to identify and understand the key stakeholders, including resear ch organizations and individual researchers, as well as the interactions between those stakeholders and the tools and standards that they use [3]. Some of the most challenging a nd important questions regarding data reuse revolve around specific details of data collection and how those details directly affect ne w analyses [4]. Understanding the original context of data stored in repositories is especially important when the original purpose differs from the purpose for reuse [1,2]. These challenges become even more pronounced when data is used across different communities of prac tice, organizations, or technical systems [6]. Every time data m oves across any of these boundaries there is potential for that data to become misinterpreted or lost [6]. To complicate matters, the creation of metadata to effectively describe data is time consuming a nd is often viewed as unrewarding by the data creator. These challenges are complicated by the natural tendency of the person collecting data to document that data based on their own anticipated future uses [4]. All this implies the need for data managers to assist researchers in overcoming the challenges of data sharing and reuse. For example, data managers help to address the challenge of understanding the original context in which data was collected by ensuring the metadata associated with published data is clear and complete. Data managers are a critical, but overl ooked, component of the human infrastructure that makes data sh aring possible [13]. Despite their important role in the human infrast ructure of cyberinfrastructure, these gatekeepers have been largely left out of CSCW literature. These observations led to tw o research questions: 1) What challenges do data managers face, and 2) How does this role compare to the CI roles studied in the past? This survey of data repository managers examined components related to preparing data for publication for which individual researchers are typically respons ible. Additionally, the survey sought to understand what types of errors data managers were most likely to encounter when receiving data for publication. This survey was distributed as an online survey, and was open for responses from July 2012 through November 2012. We sent the survey request email in two waves. First, we sent an email with the survey link and later reminders to data managers in each author X  X  respective communities, which had a 79.5% response rate. For the second wave, we extracted data manager email addresses from the Databib website (http://databib.org ), a directory of research data repositories and sent an email request with the survey link to the resulting list. The response rate fo r this portion of the sample was 37.8%. Overall, the survey was sent to a total of 113 data managers, with 59 responses for a to tal response rate of 52%.. The focus of the survey was on the interaction between data managers at scientific data repos itories and the researchers in the community served by that data repository. Initial survey questions identified the nature of the community each data repository primarily serves. The remainder of the survey focused on the Data Center Stewardship and Archive Functions proposed by Author 2 (acquire, document, archive, provi de citation, distribute, provide outreach and user support, and provide long-term stewardship) [5]. For each of these services, the su rvey asked respondents about the data related services offered at their repository and some of the common errors they saw in relation to these services [12]. The final few questions attempted to understand the motivations and challenges data repositories face when asking researchers to deposit data into the repository. These questi ons were phrased in the form of a list of motivations and constraints gathered from previous studies on data publication [7]. Respondents had the opportunity to offer an open-ended response to these ques tions in addition to selecting multiple items from the list provided. Many of the repositories included in this survey served researchers from multiple subject areas. A la rge percentage of those who responded served fields related to ecology and environmental science, because of the communities represented by Authors 2 and 3. Repositories for fields related to the physical and social sciences were also well represented. Wh ile most repositories served communities of a few hundred to a few thousand researchers, a reasonable portion also served research communities of 10,000 or more. Again, this distribution re flects the higher response rate from authors X  repositories. According to our survey, data managers regularly encountered a wide variety of data management errors. Most data managers who responded to the survey reported planning errors (93%) in the data submitted by researchers (Table 1). The most common problem was neglecting to review and update data management plans (DMP) after they were written. Data mana gers also mentioned a variety of related planning errors, including not involving data centers until data were produced, researchers not having a plan for the long-term archive process, and researchers not making themselves familiar with data deposition requirements.

The most common methodological errors data manage rs observed were a lack of description of the data limitations and quality control (Table 2). Other errors related to the methodology description include: lack of temporal and spatial coverage (e.g. exact dates and site coordinates), neglecting to update method and in strumentation descriptions, and omitting details that are common knowledge within a researcher X  X  own sub-discipline but not to outsiders.

The majority of data managers reported non-descriptive labels (Tab le 3). Other errors reported by the data managers include: incomple te descriptions of data codes and units, as well as missing files,and incorrect file names.

The most common error reported was neglecting to describe the potential uses of the deposited data followed by lack of data provenance (Table 4). About a third frequently reported lack of definiti ons and lack of descriptions of variables. Other metadata errors mentioned by data managers were inaccurate information, esoteric descriptions, and no descriptions at all.

Of those, 47% (22) reported that researchers do not include the scripts or workflows used to integrate data sets. Data managers also me ntioned that researchers did not include metadata from original da ta sets, or researchers would integrate data sets with inc onsistent taxonomy or methodology. A similar problem existed for the anal ysis and visualization of data sets, and many data managers (21 out of 47) reported that researchers did not include the scripts or workflows used to analyze or visualize their data sets. Ot her difficulties mentioned by data managers were researchers neglecti ng to include the equations used in data analysis, and incorrect cartographic methods for visualization. Most data managers reported th at researchers were willing to deposit data, with 77% (36 out of 47) saying researchers were frequently or always willing to share data. Data managers reported that researchers had a variety of reasons for depositing data in repositories. The most common were: the greater good of the scientific community (74%); greater visibility for the researcher X  X  own work (80%); and funding s ource requirements (80%). Other reasons for data deposition were extr a services provided by the data repository and easier access to and discovery of data. Data managers also reported a variety of reasons that researchers were reluctant to deposit their data, with lack of experience in data management (79%) being the mo st common reason. Other common reasons were a lack of resources (65%) and fear the data would be misused or misunderstood (60%). Da ta managers also reported that there was a lack of funding for data archival. On the other hand, some data managers said that while these factors had influenced data deposition in the past, they we re less important considerations now. Another factor mentioned was the growing prevalence of institutional repositories, which give researchers more choices as to where to deposit their data. Data managers encountered a vari ety of problems when data was submitted to a repository, which are unique to data managers, although there are parallels to other groups studied previously. Data managers are similar to librarians, in that the work they perform is often taken for granted, and therefore invisible [19]. Like CI software developers, the fina l product is set out for public use and critique, which Star &amp; Strauss called  X  X mbedded background work X , or  X  X oing backstage X  [19]. Both librarians and data managers manage and share information, but what differs is when they perfo rm these tasks. A librarians X  job is to give clients the information they need, often by bringing a nebulous request into focus [15]. Along the same lines, data managers often acquire data with nebulous metadata and make it clearer through their knowledge of a certain field or their client. Both data managers and research librarians need to have an in-depth knowledge of the data in their holdings in order to help direct clients to the most relevant, complete, and accurate data sets or references [15]. Essentially, data managers act as critical intermediaries both when data is deposited in the repository and when people are looking for data to use. Another way data managers parallel research librarians is that the effort required to offer research da ta services is often invisible to clients requesting the work [15]. Researchers rarely see the work that goes into making the data they deposit in a repository usable to a wider audience. Unfortunately, this invisibility can lead to those roles being perceived as unnecessary and therefore able to be eliminated and replaced by software [15]. Unlike librarians, the end result of data managers X  work is highly visible. In this fashion, data ma nagers are closer to CI software developers. Data managers curate raw data into usable data while typically working on multiple projects in parallel. Where CI software developers typically only have researchers as end users, data managers must first help re searchers who create new data for the repository, as well as assist researchers and policy makers who are looking for data to answer a potentially wide range of questions that did not occur to the person creating the data. A good data manager is rather like an entrepreneur X  X ble to take on different roles as needed. Some of these roles are obvious, like maintaining the domain knowledge and technical skills necessary to serve the repository X  X  clients effectively. These requirements alone mandate extensive and continuing e ducation. Data managers also need expertise in areas that are harder to pin down. On one hand, data managers must be able to listen to and adapt to their clients X  requirements. On the other side, data managers need to be advocates for their repository in order to procure both funding to maintain the repository and to convince researcher s to archive their data in the repository. These skills are harder to teach, and often come with experience. Data managers face challenges on multiple fronts, most of which center around carefully balancing the needs and requirements of various stakeholders that may not always mesh seamlessly, including relationships with re searchers, maintaining domain knowledge, and larger organizational pr essures [3]. At the center of these challenges is the need to address the social context of data creation and reuse, specifically choos ing the right data and metadata to preserve so those reusing the data can assess the data X  X  quality and usefulness for their own purposes, and the politics of funding ongoing maintenance [1]. Many of the most immediate challenges originate with the idiosyncratic data received from researchers. In terms of data ingest, the first challenge is that while researchers may write a data management plan, they fail to maintain and adhere to that plan. This is illustrated by our finding that over half (54%) of the data managers reported that researcher s make a data management plan, but do not regularly review and update that plan. While researchers are starting to recognize the importance of effective data management, updating the data management plan to reflect changes to a research project is still a lo w priority [7]. This creates a problem, because when researchers decide to share their data without following a data manageme nt plan throughout the research project, the result is often poorly documented and unusable data. Another challenge related to receiving archival data is the lack of clear descriptions of the data. A cl ear description of data collection, quality control, and data analysis methods and the data is critical for re-using data after the data is de posited in a repository [14]. This type of knowledge is so common w ithin a given discipline that it may not occur to researchers that the procedures need to be documented. One data manager desc ribed the challenge as,  X  X ften they omit details which are co mmon knowledge within their own sub-discipline ... but not known to outsiders. These details are too obvious to mention, for them, but if I have to ask, I assume others not in their field would have to ask. X  This can lead to titles and labels for data columns and variab les that are obvious to those who generate the data, but can be confusing to others. More challenges present themselves when data managers document data after it has been deposited. Some of these challenges can be addressed through intimate domain knowledge, but maintaining this is part of the backstage work that often goes unrecognized [15]. Some data repositories address this concern by creating metadata as a service to their depositors, but this requires expertise in the field of the data creator. The challenge repositories face in offering these services is that they handle data that is extremely heterogeneous. Many data repositories serve such a wide variety of scientific fields that maintaining enough expertise in any one field to add accurate metadata to every data set is impossible. This leads to the final challenge : navigating the requirements of larger research organizations and funding agencies. The final set of challenges center around research organizations and funding agencies. Many research organizations do not recognize the importance of research data servi ces and data managers [21]. The result is that these organizations re legate data services to already overworked librarians, often without offering librarians the training they need to offer expanded research data services [21]. Funding organizations also fall short wh en recognizing the importance of data sharing. Most data managers said the best way to encourage management (82%). In open e nded responses, data managers suggested funding agencies could do more to encourage data sharing by giving grants for researchers to use existing data, and research institutions should encourag e and reward data sharing. Researchers should view data ma nagers as a key resource for throughout the research life cycle. Ideally, researchers will start working with repository data managers in the research planning stages, prior to data collection. Th e advantage of this is that data managers can help researchers unde rstand what aspects of the data collection context are important to record and preserve. Data managers can offer advice to researchers regarding what metadata is most important to record during data collection. Once the data is collected, data managers can help researchers review the data and existing metadata, and determine what additional information is necessary while the data collection processes are still fresh in the researchers X  memory. While data mangers can offer critical advice, metadata is best when created by the researchers who ga thered the data. All too often, detailed knowledge of how data is generated and organized is lost when students employed on a resear ch project graduate or move on to other projects [6]. As one data manager put it,  X  X esearch is not often run by a single party but by many PIs and gra duate students, so the knowledge that is needed to fully document a data set is often distributed between all of the researchers, which just adds to the difficulty of gathering the needed information. X  Requiring all members of a research team to document their individual knowledge before, during, and after the data collection process can mitigate the problems generated by this distri bution of knowledge [12]. Tools to remind and aid researchers to ta ke detailed notes would allow researchers to generate the methodological metadata that is critical to later re-use. Many of the challenges mentioned stem from researchers X  lack of knowledge regarding good data manage ment practices [21]. As data sets become larger, this knowledge becomes more important. For example, a basic knowledge of computer programming provides a complement to data organization, since programming can automate and standardize many of the tedious and error-prone aspects of data management and processi ng. Unfortunately, this type of technical knowledge is not emphasized in early career training, which forces researchers to pick up the knowledge on the job, where errors are much more costly [20]. To address this, about half of the data managers surveyed (51%) offered training and assistance regarding data management best practices, including data management, data documentation, data organization, file structure, and storage. Most data managers (85%) performed a variety of quality checks on the data they received from researchers. Data managers reported using a large variety of means to check the quality of ingested data, the most common method being l ogical consistency checks. The most thorough data managers will read every submitted file from beginning to end to discover inc onsistencies in metadata and missing data. Others give the submitte d data to experts for review or compare submitted data to published literature. With this level of quality checking, researchers should keep in mind that data publication is similar to publication of results in that there may be multiple iterations prior to final publication in order to address issues with data and metadata.
 Universities and other research ins titutions need to take an active role in encouraging data publication. Unfortunately, research institutions often lag behind the needs of researchers in providing research data services, such as data management and storage [21]. While some fields such as bioche mistry have well-established data repositories, researchers in other fields such as materials science must search long and hard for a reasonable place to publish their data. On the policy side, research ers will be more likely to publish data if data publication is take n into account during promotion and tenure cases. This paper articulates the role of data managers. We present key differences between the socio-tec hnical context of data managers and other  X  X uman infrastructure X  ro les articulated previously in CSCW literature. We provide a summary of challenges that data managers across a variety of fields face when accepting data for archival and reuse. These challenges include: out of date or non-existent data management plans, lack of description of data collection and analysis methods, and descriptive metadata that is not understandable to those outside a scientific field. In the design implications, we focused on the two opposing forces pushing on data managers. First, we suggested designing tools to help reduce the burden of generating accurate methodological descriptions on individual research ers. Second, we suggested policy changes that research organiza tions and funding agencies could implement to encourage data sharing and reuse. Future work will explore the experience of being a data manager in order to answer the remaining question: what tool s or policies can more directly assist the data managers in eff ectively generating and maintaining accurate and useful data products? Currently, researchers across disciplines have access to larger amounts of data than in the past, due to advances in data collection and analysis technology, as well as data centers that can curate, store, and distribute these data. While these technological improvements have dramatically increased the possibilities available to researchers, the increased data collection and analysis capabilities also present researchers with new data management challenges that many are not properly trained to face. This means that the role of data managers and data centers will become even more important, one that CSCW cannot afford to ignore.
