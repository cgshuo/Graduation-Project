 Analyzing the large volume of online reviews would produce useful knowledge that could be of economic values to vendors and other interested parties. In particular, the sentiments expressed in the online reviews have been shown to be strongly correlated with the sales performance of products. In this paper, we present an adaptive sentiment analysis model called S-PLSA + , which aims to capture the hidden sentiment factors in the reviews with the capability to be incrementally updated as more data become available. We show how S-PLSA + can be applied to sales performance prediction using an ARSA model developed in previous literature. A case study is conducted in the movie domain, and results from preliminary experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Online reviews present a wealth of information on products and services, and if properly utilized, can provide vendors highly valu-able intelligence to facilitate the improvement of their business. As such, a growing number of recent studies have focused on the eco-nomic values of reviews, exploring the relationship between the sales performance of products and their reviews [3, 2, 4]. Gruhl et al. [3] show that the volume of relevant postings can help predict the sales rank of books on Amazon, especially the spikes in sales ranks. Ghose et al. [2] also demonstrate that subjectivity of reviews can have an impact on sales performance.

Liu et al. [4] propose a probability model called Sentiment PLSA (S-PLSA for short) based on the assumption that sentiment consists of multiple hidden aspects. They develop a model called ARSA (which stands for Auto-Regressive Sentiment-Aware) to quantita-tively measure the relationship between sentiment aspects and re-views. Our experience with running ARSA on several online re-view datasets reveals that the model is highly sensitive to the sen-timent factors, which are constantly changing over time as new re-views become available. It is therefore essential to allow the S-PLSA model to adapt to newly available review data.

To this end, we take a Bayesian approach, and propose an adap-tive version of the S-PLSA model that is equipped with the incre-mental learning capability for continuously updating the model us-ing newly observed reviews. The proposed model is motivated by the principle of quasi-Bayesian (QB) estimation, which has found successful applications in various domains such as adaptive speech recognition and text retrieval [1]. We call the proposed model the S-PLSA + model, in which the parameters are estimated by maxi-mizing an approximate posterior distribution. One salient feature of our modeling is the judicious use of hyperparameters, which can be recursively updated in order to obtain up-to-date posterior dis-tribution and to estimate new model parameters. This modeling approach makes it possible to efficiently update the model parame-ters in an incremental manner without the need to re-train the model from scratch each time as new reviews become available.
In the S-PLSA model [4], a review can be considered as being generated under the influence of a number of hidden sentiment fac-tors. The use of hidden factors provides the model the ability to accommodate the intricate nature of sentiments, with each hidden factor focusing on one specific aspect. What differentiates S-PLSA from conventional PLSA is its use of a set of appraisal words [4] as the basis for feature representation. The rationale is that those appraisal words, such as  X  good " or  X  terrible ", are more indicative of the review X  X  sentiments than other words.

For a given set of N reviews D = { d 1 ,...,d N } , and the set of M appraisal words W = { w 1 ,...,w M } , the S-PLSA model dictates that the joint probability of observed pair ( d i erated by P ( d i ,w j ) = P ( d i ) P K k =1 P ( w j | z z k  X  Z = { z 1 ,...,z K } corresponds to the latent sentiment fac-tor, and where we assume that d i and w j are independent condi-tioned on the mixture of associated sentiment factor z k . The set of parameters  X  of this model consist of { P ( w j | z k ) ,P ( z maximum likelihood estimates of which can be obtained through an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm [4].
The S-PLSA model can be trained in a batch manner on a col-lection of reviews, and then be applied to analyze others. In many cases, however, the reviews are continuously becoming available, with the sentiment factors constantly changing. We thus hope to adapt the model to the newly obtained reviews, in order to make it more suitable to the changing contexts. A na X ve way to perform the adaptation is to re-train the model from scratch using all data available including the newly obtained data, which is clearly highly inefficient. Here, we propose a model called S-PLSA + , which per-forms incremental learning based on the principle of quasi-Bayesian (QB) estimation. The basic idea is to perform updating and down-dating at the same time by (i) incrementally accumulating statistics on the training data, and (ii) fading out the out-of-date data.
Let D n be the set of reviews made available at epoch n (e.g., the reviews published on a certain day, but the time unit used can be set to be finer or coarser based on the need), and denote by  X  n = {D 1 ,..., D n } the set of reviews obtained up to epoch n . QB S-PLSA estimates at epoch n are determined by maximizing the posterior probability using  X  n :
In order to allow closed-form recursive update of  X  , we use the to approximate the posterior density P (  X  |  X  n  X  1 ) , where  X  evolved from review sets  X  n  X  1 . This leads to  X  ( n ) D n and the current statistics  X  ( n  X  1) are used to update the S-PLSA parameters, and the set of reviews D n are discarded after new pa-rameter values  X  ( n ) are obtained, which results in significant sav-ings in computational resources.
 The particular choice of the prior g (  X  |  X  ) in our model is the Dirichlet density, which can be expressed by where  X  = {  X  j,k , X  k,i } are the hyperparameters of the Dirichlet distribution. Assuming for the moment that  X  ( n  X  1) is known, we can show that  X  ( n ) can be obtained through an EM algorithm [1].
A major benefit of S-PLSA + lies in its ability to continuously update the hyperparameters. We can show that the new hyperpa-rameters are given by where the posterior P ( n ) ( z k | d ( n ) i ,w ( n ) j ) is computed using D the current parameters  X  ( n ) , and c ( d ( n ) i ,w ( n )
To summarize, S-PLSA + works as follows. In the startup phase, initial estimates of the hyperparameters  X  (0) are obtained. Then, at each learning epoch n , (i) new estimates of the parameters  X  are computed based on the newly available data D n and hyperpa-rameters obtained from epoch n  X  1 ; and (ii) new estimates of the hyperparameters  X  ( n ) are obtained using (1) and (2). This way, the model is continuously updated when new reviews ( D available, and at the same time fades out historical data  X  the information contained in  X  n  X  1 already captured by  X 
The proposed S-PLSA + model can be employed in a variety of tasks, e.g., sentiment clustering, sentiment classification, etc. As a sample application, we plug it into the ARSA model proposed in [4], which is used to predict sales performance based on reviews and past sales data. The original ARSA model uses S-PLSA as the component for capturing sentiment information. With S-PLSA the ARSA model can be formulated as follows: where (i) y t denotes the sales figure at time t after proper pre-processing such as de-seasoning, (ii) p , q, and R are user-chosen parameters, (iii)  X  i and  X  i,j are coefficents to be estimated using training data, and (iv)  X  t,j = 1 |R the set of reviews available at time t and p ( z j | d ) is computed based on S-PLSA + . It reflects the sentiment  X  X ass" that can be attributed to factor z j . The ARSA model can be trained using linear least squares regression. Note that the notion of time ( t ) in the ARSA model is different from the epoch ( n ) in S-PLSA + . For example, sales prediction can be made for each day using ARSA, whereas the model adaptation of S-PLSA + can happen every other day.
Experiments were conducted on an IMDB dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the pre-diction accuracy of ARSA using S-PLSA + and that of the original ARSA. The dataset was obtained from the IMDB Website by col-lecting 28,353 reviews for 20 drama films released in the US from May 1, 2006 to September 1, 2006, along with their daily gross box office revenues. Half of the movies are used for batch training. For the original ARSA, the trained model is then used to make pre-dictions in the testing data consisting of the other half the movies. For the proposal model, adaptation of the S-PLSA + component is performed for each movie in the testing set, in four epochs on four different days v ( v = 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ) using the review data available up to day v . The up-to-date model at day v is then used for subsequent prediction tasks.

We use the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to measure the prediction accuracy: MAPE = 1 T P T i =1 ( | Pred i  X  True where T is the number of instances in the testing set, and Pred True i are the predicted value and the true value respectively. The results on the accuracy of the original ARSA and that of the ARSA using S-PLSA + updated at Epochs 1-4 ( v = 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ) respectively are shown in the table below.
 The accuracy improves as the model is getting updated in the first two epochs, which demonstrates the benefits of having an incre-mental model to absorb new information; especially in our case, S-PLSA + allows the models to be adapted to the individual movies. The accuracy stays stable from Epoch 2 through Epoch 4, indicat-ing that no significant new information is available from Epoch 2 to Epoch 4.
In this paper, we have presented an adaptive S-PLSA model that is capable of incrementally updating its parameters and automat-ically downdating old information when new review data become available. This model has been used in conjunction with the ARSA model for predicting sales performance. Preliminary experimen-tal results show that by allowing the model to be adaptive, we can capture new sentiment factors arising from newly available re-views, which can greatly improve the prediction accuracy. For fu-ture work, we plan to study the performance of S-PLSA + in other information retrieval and data mining tasks.
