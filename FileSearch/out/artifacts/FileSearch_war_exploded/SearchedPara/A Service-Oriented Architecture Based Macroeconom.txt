 management and policy making. As MAFS is very important to illustrate regional and data integration and system replanting. MAFS has two bottlenecks in its development and applications: 
Model update, reuse and system integration. The accuracy and effectiveness of the outcome of MAFS are guaranteed by the models and methods based on the economic fluctuation theory. As economy grows quickly, new economic phenomena appear MAFS in time. But since these systems are mostly based on traditional architectures, they can only be accessed within local systems or LAN and do not provide interfaces models rapidly. collected and integrated effectively. 
According to the bottleneck s mentioned above, this paper proposes a MAFS based integration problems effectively. 
In general, the SOA-based MAFS has the advantages as below:  X 
Reusable modules. Based on modularization of the low-level service, complex services can be assembled by those low-level modules in order to realize the reuse of service can be used more flexibly.  X 
Easier maintenance. The loose coupling relationship between service supplier and  X  none difference between platforms and languages. Any modules or services programmed by a certain language can reuse other services programmed with another language.  X  Integration of distributed resources. realization of SMAFS; section 4 evaluates the system performance with comparison to the traditional one, and section 5 gives the conclusion. main macroeconomic index in the future (this is performed by macroeconomic forecasting sub-system). 2.1 The Goals and Functions of SMAFS Based on business cycle theory, this paper develops MAFS and use multi-mathematics methods 5 to establish MCIS, EWS 6 and EFS. 
The main workflow of this system include: 1) obtaining monthly, season and annual calculate economic cycle index; 5) using econometric model to judge and forecast the warning curve; 7) judging the consistence of economic cycle index, warning signal and correct the model. 
SMAFS compasses 6 sub-systems: macroeconomic cycle index sub-system (MCIS), interface sub-system (UIS). The functional structure is shown in Fig.1. 
The Heterogamous Data Integration Platform serves as the data support platform of the SMAFS. It draws data from various heterogamous databases and transforms them feedback the result with the form of table and/or charts to users. 2.2 The Sub-systems of SMAFS MCIS MCIS consists of two functions:  X 
Select economic cycle indicators.  X  Compound cycle index. EWS Then it uses the related data processing method to combine some indicators into one economic development trend by observing and analyzing the changes of signals. EFS EFS consists of two functions:  X 
Simultaneous equations model forecasting sub-system 10 .  X  Single indicators forecasting system. Data file management sub-system develop the perfect function of data file management, as shown in Fig.2. User interface sub-system The Figure 3 depicts the SMAFS main user interface and a couple of output screenshot. Fig.3(a) shows the gateway user interface, Fig.3 (b) shows the output chart of MCIS, while Fig.3 (c) illustrates the output chart of data file management sub-system. 
SMAFS is operated under B/S structure and the users can visit the each sub-systems output in figures and charts etc. The core thought of the SMAFS is to provide clients with varied modules and methods provided with the data type of XML Schema. Services and registered on UDDI. Once the client (normally browsers, but also can be calls appropriate Web Services (either local or demote ones) to deal with the request and give responses. The remote Web Services will be located through the UDDI server. SMAFS is depicted in Fig.4. 3.1 The Design and Realization of Web Services Based Econometric Model file, process it and return result. 
In SMAFS, the most widely used econometric models are implemented by the form Services carries out the functions as follows:  X 
Providing publicly accessible en dpoints for service requests.  X  Authenticating and authorizing incoming service requests.  X  components, the function can be flexibly extended in the interface level.  X  through standard protocols in Internet environment.  X 
Across the heterogonous platform. 3.2 Web Services Based Heterogonous Data Integration Platform we build a uniform data platform to integrate data from heterogeneous databases via a uniform interface offered. Web Services tech nology provides a distributed computing of existent solution. The heterogeneous data integration framework is shown in Fig.6. interface for the external data consumers. SMAFS.

It consists of various databases with or act as heterogeneous database X  X  offering data service independently. seasons and annual data of all industrials. compound of coincident index and draw early-warning signal charts. efficiency and results of system through three tests. [Test1] The comparison of the results of coincident index other is provided by the system after data integrated. We employ artificial method to collect the data from China Statistic annuals, China China Economy Statistic Database, etc., and generate coincident index 2 . network spot. They are all encapsulated with the form of Web Services, which can be accessed by other appropriate applications. The details of them are shown in Table2. The output of the CI that results from the coincident indicator group is depicted in Fig.7.

The forecast results indicate that their fo recasting errors are 30% within 1%, 90% system is 3 to 5 days, in contrast with that of traditional system (20 to 30 days). Macroeconomic Analysis &amp; Forecasting Syst em. In SMAFS, all econometric models are provided in the form of Web Services. The Heterogonous Data Integration Platform serves as the data support of the SMAFS, which draws data from various heterogonous database and transform them into the format that required by models X  calculation and integrate them as needed. The architecture, functionality and implementing methods of SMAFS are designed and implemented. The major advantages brought by the SMAFS are as follows:  X 
Achieving the model reuse. The SOA brings the system high extensibility through the Web Services interface, which makes the developer and end-user convenient to access required logic and data resources. Only by encapsulating data resources into 
Web Services, we have saved about 40% cost and time.  X 
Enhancing the system performance. Through three representative case examples, we compared the performance of the traditional system and SMAFS. We found that the output from the latter was much more accurate and of more effectiveness than that of the former. The reason is that SMAFS incorporates more data sources from
