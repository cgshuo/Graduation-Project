 Abstract: Some of the largest worldwide employers today are knowledge-based enterprises whose most important asset is human capital. Knowledge workers are unique, each having individualized skills, competencies and expertise, which constantly evolve and expand. Managing and planning for such a workfor ce critically depends on the ability to construct comple te, accurate, and real-time representation and inventory of the expertise of employees in a form that integrates with business processes. In this session Sa X ka will describe how enterprise expertise assessment process can be posed as predictive modeling and recommendation problem, and will present results and lessons learned from an actual deployment of IBM Expertise, a corporate-wide expertise recommendation and management system.
