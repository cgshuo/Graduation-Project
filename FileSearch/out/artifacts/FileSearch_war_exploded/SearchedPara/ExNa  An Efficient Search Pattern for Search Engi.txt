 As the Web enters Big Data age, users and search engines may find it more and more difficult to effectively use and manage such big data. New types of search engines are emerging to solve the problem [1] and differ ent search engines serve users in different search system that are directly related to the search process. resources. 
Based on the definition of SP, we propose a new search pattern named ExNa, and Interactive Mechanism.

Wei et al. 2.1 The Multi-layered Semantic Link Network Index Structure ExNa requires a multi-layered network index structure, which should have rich semantic relations, high efficient storage, and free-styled interaction with users. Definition 2: A Multi-layered Semantic Link Network Index Structure, MNIS, is mappings between two adjacent layers in the vertical direction; {} j Rres = is the set of resources. 
The MNIS provides the basic framework to index web resources into a semantic-selections of different semantic granularities and dimensions. 2.2 User Profile A user profile records a user X  X  interests and is used to provide personalized services. engines. Here we define a user profile supporting four levels as ,, UP =  X  X  X  X  , denotes the semantic relation between i node and j node , with  X  being the weight of the semantic relation;  X  ={big granularity, small granularity, top-down, bottom-up, up-and-down, zigzag,...},  X  is the set of search modes which records how a user uses a search engine. Everyone has his/her fixed search pattern when he/she uses the engine and the mode of acquiring information, which can be summarized from the interaction processes. The four levels of UP can be gotten when some constraints are added on UP, which are listed as follows. 2.3 Interaction Mechanism Interaction mechanism provides free-styled interaction with MNIS for user to acquire semantic granularities, different semantic dimensions, and different nodes in semantic into 13 ~ UP UP , while the dynamic interests can be summarized as search modes to be updated to  X   X   X  , where and select the top-n from the sorted results. (2) Broaden +  X  : +  X  is the inverse operation of  X   X  , which means increasing the granularity and shift the focus to a higher level. Generally, the multi-granularity index +  X  is defined without the filter operation  X  as follows: (3) Expand  X  :  X  is a semantic expand operation to support user travelling (R ,SLN )  X  is the final result after getting filtered by 702 X. Wei et al. Networ k Index Structure of KNOWLE (4) Pattern Switch  X  : This operator is to change the search mode from Narrow to Expand or from Expand to Narrow. The pattern switch happens when the search mode changes actively or passively. Active change is done by user, while passive change is done by the search engine according to the mode  X  in 4 UP .  X  is defined as / = direction changes from vertical to horizo ntal and from horizontal to vertical respectively. To validate the proposed search pattern ExNa, we develop a prototype search engine KNOWLE gathers web news from major news websites in China, clusters them into news topics, and organizes them into the multi-layered Semantic Link Network Index Structure, as shown in Fig.1. KNOWLE provides a free-styled interaction mechanism KNOWLE is shown in Fig.2. The experiments on KNOWLE show that ExNa is an efficient search pattern to improve the efficiency of search engine. 1.
