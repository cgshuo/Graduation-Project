 1. Introduction
In most technical problems, the optimality criteria cannot be tion problems deal with problems where the formulation is characterized by several optimality criteria that individually do
In such problems, best-compromise formulations determine the trade-off optima that are assumed to truthfully model the combined impact of the individual excellence criteria.
In design optimization and decision-making, the constraints are typically more obvious then appropriate measures of design of minimum mass or some similar tangible physical metrics directly linked to the design geometry. However, this does not necessarily correspond to the notion of value that the user experiences related to the respective product. His/her impression of the product excellence is wider and includes both the initial
The user X  X  notion of the product excellence would in most cases be composed of a number of qualitative criteria including subjective and intangible expectations, etc. A decision-support function and result in the particular design which maximizes the overall life-time performance corresponding to the given dis-tribution of operational conditions.

Those multi-objective optimization problems where all partial objectives can be represented by economic value equivalents can potentially be formulated as single-objective best-compromise problems as shown here. However, this implies that the model of the problem needs to go beyond the purely technical specification and must be expanded to the equivalent economic model for decision support that accounts for all the economic aspects as the future operating conditions needs to be specified over the entire life-span. Appropriate value-based modeling of the ex-corresponding valuation terms making the proposed approach to optimum design a value-based decision-support model.
Within the project performance valuation methodology in the business assessment environment, evaluation of projects typically encompasses the integral valuation of performance over the entire project life-cycle. This includes the valuation and cumulation of all recurrent elements (ongoing operation) and non-recurrent investment-related inputs. In order to accomplish the formulation in terms of their respective tangible value and attributed to done by time-based discounting and aggregation of individual elements. Such an approach leads to integral measures of excellence named Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).

A measure of integral value-based design excellence simplified for the purpose of optimum design as developed in this paper is approach proposes the measurement of design excellence ex-pressed in terms of several optimality criteria based on the be expressed by corresponding value contribution terms, which have to be aggregated for the given distribution of different operational regimes during the corresponding product life-span. in constructing the fitness functions in optimum design. Multi-objective design optimization is consequently expanded from purely engineering terms to coupled engineering X  X inancial deci-sion-making by an a priori value-related compromise. In the simple form as developed in this paper, the design variables and constraints are modeled in engineering terms only, with objec-tives formulated in the  X  X xpanded space X  using equivalent economic values. In many cases, individual optimality criteria can be expressed equivalently by their respective economic impact during the entire respective life-span. In those cases, in economic categories such as investments, operational expenses, compromise criterion can be defined as an aggregate measure for the domain of candidate solutions. This implies that respective investment costs and all accompanying operating costs over the entire life-time of all candidate solutions (parameterized by optimization variables) need to be included. 2. Value-based excellence approach to optimum design
The approach presented here is to treat multi-objective optimum design using an a priori compromise formulation based on the full life-span value aggregate indicator. This measure is intended to truthfully encompass the integral economic value associated with the product and hence be an adequate indicator of the total excellence of the candidate designs. In order to do so, non-recurrent elements (investments) and recurrent elements (various costs during operation) must be taken into account. Due to the time-dependent character of economic value, all these elements must be expressed in terms of their respective equivalent economic value at a defined moment of reference, discounted accordingly, and aggregated into an integral measure.
The companion aspect with multi-criterial optimization is multi-ple criteria decision-making or compromise decision-making, where a number of a priori and a posteriori approaches are used.
The challenging and complex problem of handling multiple criterial decision-making is dealt with by many researchers,
Pareto front implies extensive and expensive computation, and a priori compromise formulations offer inexpensive computation but provide less (sometimes subjective) information. The concept of the Net Present V alue (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) aggregate measures ( Behrens and Hawranek, 1991;
Bendekovic  X  et al., 1993) has been applied in business project evaluations and operations research, but typically not in the compromises is partly related also to problems with variable mustbelinkedtotheirgivendistributionsovertheentirelife-span, stage product design processes. A survey of the current status of development problems also discu sses mass vs. cost as excellence approach proposed by Hazelrigg (1998) , combining market-related a matter of ongoing research. The coordination and balancing of marketing, engineering design and manufacturing subproblems in (2006 ). These papers argue that problem modeling and formulation more impact than applied algorithms on finding the optimal decision-making is discussed, and several authors include the investment terms and operational expenses (such as running costs) decision support framework for design is discussed in Olewnik and Lewis (2006) .

An elaboration of cost terms ( Laan and Tooren, 2005 ) in the design of aircraft movables also lists many items that enter the corresponding feasibility evaluation. An example of applying value-based compromise decision-making is also found in Combining different ingredients of cost as excellence criteria in 2002 ) was also considered from the viewpoint of a cost/ performance trade-off problem.

Performance-based and value-based designs are also com-pared in Peoples and Willcox (2006 ) using deterministic and probabilistic NPV-based measures and other, also taking risk and uncertainty into account. Maximization of profits based on NPV planning of hydropower stations. In Georgiopoulos et al. (2002 ), the decision problem based on expected value of NPV for the firm (automotive) is discussed as the objective function, which depends both on the product portfolio and the product design variables, including uncertainty. An application in industrial where product platform components are optimized for flexibility with performance-and economic objectives, using structural and economic simulation under uncertainty (NPV and Monte Carlo). Design-related issues of robust optimization ( Pediroda et al., increasingly being introduced in decision-making.

The simplest definition of the compromise optimality criterion f ( x ) f  X  x  X  X  and prescribe the fraction of relative impact of an individual in many cases rather arbitrary and subjective, essentially determines the compromise optimum.

The concept of Pareto-optimality is the standard approach in if there is no point x such that f  X  x  X  o f k  X  x o pt  X  for at least one k A K  X  2  X  f  X  x  X  r f k  X  x o pt  X  for all k A K  X  3  X  functions is reduced without increasing any other.
 The final selection of the particular optimum design from the Pareto set involves a decision on the best compromise criterion. maximum offset of the values of the normalized individual criteria from the respective 1D optima has the minimum value. min max k
This is, however, numerically expensive since it implies solving for K single-objective minima or their approximations.
In this paper, a formulation of the best trade-off is developed based on total project impact valuation as used in project feasibility assessments and appraisal ( Behrens and Hawranek, 1991 ; Bendekovic  X  , 1993 ). This approach provides aggregate metrics and a framework to include cumulated discounted values the sense that it removes subjective judgment of the decision maker in the best compromise formulation and also provides decision support based on total lifetime performance of the product. It allows for both a priori compromise definition and a posteriori decision-making.

In some generic example, let the overall design excellence be a composition of the following qualitative criteria: 1. Low investment price 2. Low operational expenses 3. High revenue generation (performance-related efficiency) 4. High safety in operation 5. Low failure rate and down-time efficiency beyond nominal design-operating regimes 7. Environmental friendliness 8. Satisfaction of non-technical intangible user X  X  expectations 9. Other excellence criteria
The objectives 1, 2, and 7 typically directly (deterministically) depend on the values of the technical design variables (Eqs. (1) X  by some measure and aggregated into NPV or IRR. The objective 3 also directly depends on the design variables and also enters the NPV directly after discounting.

The criteria 4 and 5 involve uncertainty and can generally also be related to the design variables and indirectly incorporated in impact on NPV. The criterion 6 is related to the operational efficiency in changing operational conditions and to the concept can also be quantified in the NPV measure if the frequency distribution of the operational regimes over the life-span can be fluctuating conditions essentially results in the corresponding robust optimum.

The impact of reliability-related criteria 4 X 5 can be quantified in the design phase by applying Monte Carlo based simulations for and consequently be attributed value terms to contribute to the overall NPV accordingly ( Fig. 1 ).

The criteria 8 and 9 can generally not be directly attributed addition to the design variables, also depend on non-technical terms and the project environment conditions as well as interactions of the project and external circumstances. In some cases, however, these criteria can also be related to the design variables and modeled by empirical methods. 3. The multi-objective best-compromise decision criterion based on NPV and IRR successive time period ( i ) can be expressed as P  X  i  X  X  I  X  i  X  M C  X  i  X  A  X  i  X  W C  X  i  X  F  X  i  X  T  X  i  X  X  5  X  where I is the income, M C the material costs (material, energy, other costs), A the corresponding amortization, W C the cost of work, F the financial expenses, and T the taxes. The net economic flows ( E N ), which cumulatively give an integral measure of the economic potential of the project, can be calculated as E  X  i  X  X  I  X  i  X  X  R  X  i  X  IN  X  i  X  M C  X  i  X  W C  X  i  X  T  X  i  X  X  6  X  investment into fixed assets and working capital. The economic flows are analogous to the financial flows but do not include the financial flows (such as inflows, F , other) from and towards external financial sources since they are (in their total impact) Alternatively: E  X  i  X  X  P N  X  i  X  X  A  X  i  X  X  R  X  i  X  IN  X  i  X  X  7  X 
Based on the time-line in Figs. 2 and 7, the individual the NPV indicator as NPV  X  where D is the rate of discounting and n the number of successive periods. The IRR indicator is defined as that particular rate of discounting ( D n ) that adjusts the NPV value (Eq. (8)) to zero, which is evaluated iteratively: IRR  X  D ) NPV  X  D  X  X 
The NPV is interpreted as the equivalent time-zero cumulative zero-point value of the total economic potential of discounted individual contributions (Eqs. (6) and (7)). The NPV and/or IRR indicators can therefore also be used as the best compromise operation (TCO) criterion. Alternatively, the TCO criterion based on Eq. (8) or (9) can be viewed as a way to determine the economically realistic trade-off values of the weight factors w k (best compromise set) in the composed objective function in Eq. (1).

In terms of the corresponding decision support, Eqs. (8) and (9) imply that beyond the technical design variables the excellence criteria also depend on several parameters of the interaction between the project and its environment, such as the life-span or total-cost optimality measures also introduce additional degrees of nonlinearity into the standard engineering optimization model. discounting process in NPV/IRR, costs of financing, stepwise taxation schemes, stepwise availability and cost structures of form, the NPV/IRR best compromise formulation of the objective function provides an economically trustworthy measure of optimality and a corresponding objective decision-support algo-rithm. However, it generally expands the set of design variables an expanded set that additionally includes economic variables such as composition of financing, amortization-depreciation terms, timing of individual terms, management of capital, etc.
In this paper, a simplified total cost formulation (TCO) formulation is proposed for the optimum design decision-support problem, which takes into account only the costs and disregards some of the additional freedom provided by the economic based formulation of the best compromise criterion.

In the proposed simplified case (TCO), Eqs. (7) and (8) can be relaxed and combined, resulting in the objective function: min NPV TCO fg  X  min IN  X  0  X  X 
The assumptions in Eq. (10) are as follows: no tax and amortization terms R ( i )=0, no residual value within the lifespan considered
IN (0)=investment, typically cost of material and manufactur-ing
M C ( i )=periodic material cost such as energy, maintenance material W C ( i )=periodic labor cost, for example maintenance As a simple illustrative example for the decision criterion in Eq. (10), one can consider the problem of the optimum design of a simple beam under bending. One simplified approach to the objective function formulation would be that of minimizing the cross-sectional area (equivalent to minimum mass of material) and therefore investment cost. Another simplification would lead to the objective function formulation minimizing the contour of the cross-section. The latter is based on the argument that the contour is linked to the maintenance costs such as regular periodic surface maintenance and protection, which belong to the category of operational expenses. Without loss of generality, the production cost is here assumed independent of the cross-sectional shape ( Fig. 3 ).

Constraints of maximum permissible stresses and dimensional ratio are applied: max M W r s perm ; h b r 3 ) x 2 3 U x 1 r 0  X  11  X  where W is the section modulus in bending. The objective function for this simple example includes the criteria of minimum mass and minimum (squared) length of contour f  X  2 x 1 x 3  X  X  x 2 2 x 3  X  x 3 f  X  X  2 x 1  X  2  X  x 1 x 3  X  X  4 x 3  X  2  X  x 2 2 x 3  X  X  2  X  12  X  with corresponding normalization and scaling. In this particular case, using: n= life-span in years A =cross-sectional area, mm 2
C =length of contour, mm c A =investment (non-recurrent) cost of material per unit cross-sectional area c CW =periodic cost of work per unit length of contour of cross-section c CM =periodic cost of material (maintenance) per unit length of contour the following is used with Eq. (10):
IN  X  0  X  X  c A A ; M C  X  i  X  X  c C M C ; W C  X  i  X  X  c C W C  X  13  X  which yields the NPV-optimized shapes of the beam cross-section. shown in Fig. 4 and numerically given in the table below:
D 0.5 0.1 0.01 n 10 10 10 c
A 111 c
CM 0.1 0.1 0.1 c CW 0.1 0.1 0.1 A 10 3 1.37 1.60 1.75

Beyond the elements largely determined by the values of design (engineering) variables, the total value formulation would in the general case ( Fig. 6 ) also include the impact of non-deterministic parameters external to the project (market conditions, etc.).

The non-recurrent investment costs typically include product development and production, the recurrent operational expenses in generating revenue (labor, maintenance, etc.) within the life-span. As shown in Eq. (5), depreciation, costs of financing and similar elements which have an impact on the economic potential (value) of the project also belong here. Decision-support proce-dures based on elements in Fig. 6 , formulated as objective business performance.

The coupled technical X  X inancial integrated excellence metrics as proposed here is the natural criterion in decision-making for educated decision-makers aware of the economic consequences of roles of the decision maker: (1) potential buyer or commercial operator of the product, and (2) manufacturer of the product.
In the former case, the educated buyer will evaluate the product by including it into the respective business plan or feasibility study and comparing. A product with a lower price but causing higher running costs or lower income might turn out to be in the customer X  X  decision process. Moreover, the manufacturer is time, etc., with financial consequences for the direct potential for the buyer/operator of the product.

In both of their potential roles, decision-makers make their decisions under the implicit objective of maximizing profits. the decision criteria to the respective acquisition/manufacturing price, while the thorough long-term consideration includes the aggregated financial impacts altogether. In the latter case, technical product parameters need to be optimized for the total product performance measured in overall costs or profits metrics.
The Eqs. (5) X (10) are generic expressions that measure the integral commercial impact of a product measured in value-based terms as a function of the technical design variables-product properties. These expressions take case-specific forms depending on the particular product and its role in the corresponding business process and environment, which is termed coupled technical X  X conomic modeling of product excellence in this paper.
These expressions are functions that map design variables of a technical product into a value-based objective function that measures excellence.

For example, if the decision maker is in the role of the commercial operator of the product, the value of the term E
Eq. (6) is directly decreased due to product failures and down-time as the term I decreases and IN possibly increases. Lower adaptivity of the product to variable operating conditions has a similar impact on E N as I is decreased due to lower average product efficiency (beyond nominal operating regimes) and likely higher values of M C and W C terms. All these terms, modeled (10). If the decision maker is in the role of the commercial performing worse than the competitors X  products within the framework of their business processes. 4. Optimum design of sandwich plates with corrugated core
Multi-layer metal sandwich plates with corrugated core are in instead of the classical  X  X inimum weight X  approach to design optimization. The term multi-layer sandwich plates refers to metal plates with corrugated core, intended for use as structural elements in applications ranging from construction to naval and interior architecture ( Fig. 7 ).

Metal sandwich plates as high-performance structural ele-ments are considered in detail in Vinson (2005). Different design topologies of periodic cellular metal sandwich structures, their respective manufacturing methods and design issues such as core and face failure modes are discussed in Wadley et al. (2003). Various topologies of sandwich plates are considered with several load cases and buckling modes using analytic and approximate expressions (truss cores) and compared in terms of minimum Wicks and Hutchinson, 2004 ).

In this paper, a different approach to the optimum design of sandwich plates that allows for a general shape of the corrugated core (shape parameterization) is considered with approximate expressions for critical loads. The development of the decision-support algorithm for designing custom-optimized metal sand-wich plates for particular applications is expected to result in substantial savings since typical implementations involve large quantities. The decision-support process is based on design optimization for the specific requirements of the particular application with constraint equations derived from given geo-metric, mechanical and technological requirements. The goal is to design optimized plates whereby the objective function realisti-(TCO) of the plates as the excellence criterion.

In this paper, a multi-layer metal sandwich is modeled generally as consisting of a number of plane metal sheets and a composite structure ( Fig. 7 ). It is assumed that the corrugated cores will be produced by shaped rolling.

The design variables include the topology of the sandwich structure, i.e. the number of layers, with their respective composition and thicknesses (possibly with introduction of symmetries). Further design variables include the thicknesses of metal sheets, both for plane sheets and for corrugated cores.
Additional design variables are needed to define the continuous
In order to include the shapes of the curves as a design degree parameters by performing piecewise interpolation of the curves.
The interpolation parameters are then used as optimization variables which replace (represent) the continuous shape in the process of shape parameterization. The particular implementation continuity.

Investment costs and operational expenses for the plates are combined to yield an NPV-based decision criterion. The con-straints include structural integrity under operational loads, strength of bonds, minimum radii of curvature, technological make the local loadings sustainable for the elements of the structure and to prevent local buckling of plane sheets and corrugated cores from taking place. Further constraints are imposed to ensure sufficient length of glued joints (as they depend on the geometric shapes of the respective gaps between plane sheets and corrugated cores) and their respective load minimum possible radii of curvature of corrugated cores for the material used (e.g. hardened aluminum). Generally, the shapes of the cores also need to be bound by constraints that will prevent locking from taking place during production by the technological process of shaped rolling. Optimization using genetic algorithms with penalized constraints is used as shown in Fig. 8 .
The optimization model is tested on a simple  X  X umerical specimen X  as shown in Fig. 9 :
As one of the cases considered here, Fig. 10 shows the idealized geometric model of the symmetric multiple-layer metal sandwich. Based on the geometric model presented in Figs. 9 for the particular case: thickness of layer 1, H 1 the wavelength of the corrugated core: d shape piecewise interpolation points for corrugated core, curve k 1 :( x i ,y i ) ,i=1 , mt 1 the thicknesses of the plates: t o1 ,t k 1 shape piecewise interpolation points for corrugated core, curve k 2 :( x i ,y i ) ,i= 1, mt 2 the thicknesses of the plates: t o 2 ,t k 2
For the case displayed in Fig. 10 and mt 1 = mt 2 = 4 (simplest yields 10 decision variables; other options increase the number of variables further. This simplest case applies to three-segment piecewise interpolation and C 2 inter-segment continuity (Fig. 11 ).

Full description of the geometry of the corrugated cores is needed for several elements of the optimum design model, such as properties of the glued bonds, etc. In this paper, the shape parameterization is accomplished by piecewise interpolation. Within each segment, a polynomial with a sufficiently high number of degrees of freedom (coefficients) is interpolated based on a set of geometric conditions that include: (1) interpolation These interpolation points become design variables that represent tion variables of the problem. One of the particular methods applied in this paper are cubic splines.

The total cost generally includes the investment cost such as expenditure of material and production cost, but also the operational costs such as maintenance costs. In this paper, the cumulative impact is modeled based on Eqs. (8) and (9). The simplest formulation of the objective function which includes only the cost of material in a 2 H segment from Fig. 10 : f  X  2 H where ( n o 1) is the number of layers, i denotes summation over plane sheets and k over corrugated cores. The differentiation of the shape functions and integration of the lengths of the corrugated cores is implemented numerically for the current shapes of the cores based on the current values of the piecewise interpolation coefficients. In the total cost formulation of the objective function, in addition to the investment cost according to Eq. (14) , a regular annual maintenance cost term is assumed.
This term accounts for possible inspection costs and repair, the sandwich plates. This element can be modeled approximately as annual costs proportional to the total area of the corrugated plates and total number of glued bonds multiplied by their lengths as f  X  2 H  X  f  X  3 H d  X  n o 1  X  l G  X  16  X 
Some of the constraints ( Bezuhov et al., 1973 ; Hufnagel, 1988 ) are as follows:
Dimensional constraints: bounds on thicknesses of all sheets (plane and corrugated): t t where t oi denotes the thickness of the i -th plane sheet and t denotes the thickness of the i -th corrugated core.
 Bounds on thicknesses of individual layers of the sandwich:
H i r H i ; max ; i  X  1 ; n o 1  X  18  X  where H i denotes the thickness of the i -th layer of the multi-layer sandwich. Non-negativity constraints for the dimensions are implemented, and symmetry of the layers is also introduced in the cases presented.

Permissible local stresses due to axial (membrane) forces in all plane plate segments where s perm denotes the permissible stress.

Allowable local stresses due to combined axial (membrane) forces and bending in all corrugated core segments (simplified beam/plate models are used)
In the more general case, finite element analysis yields the values for s in Eq. (20).

Local buckling forces in all plane plate segments less than critical p where p o and p o , crit denote the buckling and critical load, respectively.

Local buckling forces in all corrugated core segments less than critical p
Sufficient contact length and adequate shape of all glued joints between plane sheets and corrugated cores. The shape of the corrugated cores must be such that the gap lengths between the plane sheets and corrugated cores (with gap widths less than d G ) at points of glued joints are at least l G : p k 1  X  x  X  : p k 2  X  x  X  : where p k 1 ( x ) and p k 2 ( x ) denote the interpolated curves representing the corrugated cores, d G the maximum effective thickness of the glue and l G the resulting length of the glued bond.

Allowable local stresses in all glued joints where s g,perm and t g,perm denote the permissible normal and tangential stresses in the glued joints. In this paper, the assumption is made that the geometric characteristics of the gap have direct impact on the bond strength. More realistic modeling of the glued joints is beyond the scope of this paper.
Radii of curvature of all corrugated core curves at any point need to be larger than minimum acceptable values for the material given (hardened aluminum):  X  1  X  X  d = dx  X f p ki  X  x  X g 2  X  3 = 2 where R adm denotes the admissible radius of curvature of the material of the corrugated cores ( Fig. 10 ) for the hardened condition.

Technological requirements that need to be imposed on the geometry of the sandwich. For example geometric conse-quences on the design of cores, derived from the fact that they are produced by shaped rolling and that the corresponding shaped rolls are to be produced like gears. This imposes such a shape of the corrugated cores that does not cause locking of  X  X ears X  during the rolling of the corrugated cores by shaped rolls. conditions f p ki  X  x  X g  X  26  X 
Since the geometric shapes of the corrugated cores are numerically represented by sets of interpolation coefficients using the process of piecewise interpolation with C 2 (or higher) continuity, above constraints transform into implicit constraint functions defined on the design optimization variables. These constraint equations are not expressed explicitly due to a number of numerical operations ( Pedersen evaluation. Instead, the values of all the constraint conditions are evaluated numerically at each step of the optimization process and penalized accordingly. Additional numerical procedures used in the evaluation of constraints include line search for the identification of critical sections along the interpolated corrugated core curves in each design iteration. 5. Optimum design process and results
The design optimization is performed by genetic algorithms (GA) with (SUMT) penalization of constraints (overall concept in
Michalewicz, 2005 ), applying scaled constraints and relative The numerical implementation was developed using MATLAB scripts and in some cases ADINA software for basic structural analysis. In terms of the constraint functions, approximate formulas based on simplified beam or plate models were used, or alternatively external finite-element-based analysis was launched from optimization loops within MATLAB scripts. In the latter cases, bi-directional communication of data between
MATLAB and ADINA was arranged by text files with position-based data-mining. The optimization loops were also in charge of were searched for corresponding stresses needed for constraint evaluation. In both cases custom-made data-mining procedures were used.

The size of the GA populations was varied between 20 and 200, the number of generations was in the range between 50 and 1000. reproduction, cross-over and mutation were used along with uniform population creation, variable number of elite members and crossover share in population, ranked fitness scaling, stochastic uniform selection, scattered crossover and Gaussian mutation. The initial, randomly generated shapes are also shown (partly) on the same figures for visual comparison.

In the optimization process itself, standard effects could be constraints, too large values led to dominance of penalty terms with respect to the objective function. In some cases, divergence of the optimization process has occurred. The maximum number of generations had significant impact on the final shape of the corrugated cores, since the  X  X traightening X  of the corrugated core curves due to the minimization of the length of corrugated core is a slow process with low values of respective slopes ( X  X ensitivity X ).

The test data for the numerical specimen applied in the first case were:
Thickness of sandwich: 2 H =20 mm, width of sandwich-speci-men: b =20 mm, length of numerical specimen: l =200 mm, Load: F =100N, Maximum thickness of glue at the joint: 0.2 mm Minimum length of glued joint: 1.0 mm
Minimum possible radius of curvature of corrugated core: 2.5 mm

The following figures present the impact of changing some of the constraint bounds on the optimized shape of the sandwich. Fig. 12 demonstrates the impact of changing the minimum prescribed radius of curvature of the hardened aluminum sheets used for (shaped) rolling of the corrugated core on the optimal sandwich geometry.

Fig. 13 shows the impact of changing the minimum length of the glued joint between the plane sheets and the corrugated shape of the corrugated cores by virtue of constraints imposed on the sandwich design. It is here assumed that the maximum glue thickness is 0.1 mm, and therefore the core curves at the glued joints need to  X  X dhere X  to the plane sheets such that the gap respective required lengths of the glued joints. Other simplified models of glued joints lead to different optimized shapes by imposing the glued joint conditions as functions of core shapes.
In the following cases, the TCO formulation of the objective span value metrics, the total-lifetime-cost aggregate measure is used as defined in Eq. (10). The simplified model includes the operational expenses are made proportional to the overall surface area of all plates. Of course, more realistic and more detailed modeling of non-recurrent and recurrent costs can be used with described by some function of design variables can be used to construct the criterion of the production cost or recurrent maintenance time needed.

The following parameters are held fixed in the following examples: Life-span=10 years Mass cost coefficient=1 (price per unit mass) Surface cost coefficient=0.1 (annual cost per unit surface) Investment factor=0.1 Maintenance costs factor=0.9
The first case in Fig. 14 is with the two-layer sandwich where the rate is discounting D is varied, which results in different optimal designs.

Based on the proposed decision-support proce-dure, it can be observed that with all the engineering parameters reducing the surface and increasing the mass of the respective optimized shape of the sandwich. This is a consequence of the increased relative impact of recurrent costs as opposed to non-recurrent in the decision criterion-TCO objective function. This happens by an increase in wavelength of the core (which reduces the surface area) accompanied by a necessary increase of sheet thicknesses due to imposed constraints in strength of material and buckling (Eqs. (19) X (22)).

The same decision-support algorithm with NPV objectives provides similar results if the cost coefficients are varied as parameters. For the three-layer sandwich, with a fixed rate of following: n 351 2

Again, as in Fig. 14 , the mass of the respective optimum shapes in the total cost metric measured by NPV and IRR indicators.
The graphs also include 1/4 segment of the wavelength for the initial  X  X andomly generated X  solution, and a full segment of the optimized shape ( X  X inal X ). The resulting optimized plate thick-nesses are visible at the x =0 position.

Both products selected to demonstrate the proposed objective in the  X  X ptimum shape X  of the product, depending on the the operator or owner during their respective life-times.
Excellence in commercial X  X conomic performance of those products in their respective business environments is provided by the shapes presented in Fig. 14 b and c and 15b and c.
Therefore, although the traditional  X  X inimum mass X  excellence and NPV-based excellence as developed here operate on the same shapes due to different definitions of excellence. Since the fundamental objective of economic activity is creating new value, we propose that the NPV or TCO excellence criteria should be used instead of the traditional  X  X inimum mass X  approach in optimizing demonstrate that the optimum shape of a product is a conse-quence of both technical and commercial parameters.

The proposed TCO-or NPV-based objective function for multi-criteria optimization is not necessarily a substitute for methods that generate the full Pareto fronts. The method developed here can be used with two different approaches. The first one is using the Pareto-optimality-based methods in generating the non-dominated set and then using the proposed excellence objective function in the decision-making process. This is done in order to
TCO sense, which for a commercial product can be justified much better than Eq. (1) or (4), since it generates more value. The second approach is numerically more affordable and uses the proposed NPV or TCO criterion from the beginning as a compromise function, eliminating the search for the Pareto front. where the weight factors are not chosen arbitrarily and subjec-tively, but instead are assigned values that result in highest possible commercial value that the product can deliver. 6. Conclusions
It is shown that the equivalent aggregate economic value or best-compromise formulations and decision-making in some multi-objective design optimization problems. Different technical and cost/revenue-based objectives need to be valuated, dis-counted and aggregated over the life-span of a product to arrive at the NPV or IRR aggregate measures of total value-based design modeling of the economic impact of the technical design variables engineering X  X inancial evaluation and decision-making even though the design variables space in simple cases includes engineering terms only.

This is also compatible with the  X  X ecision support X  interpreta-tion of optimization since the decisions are made based on integral economic judgment of excellence and optimality, there-fore the NPV-and IRR-based best-compromise formulations can be utilized as realistic measures in this sense.

The GA-based optimization of multi-layer metal sandwich plates based on the above approach provides an  X  X xpert system X  for the customized optimum design of sandwich plates. It yields optimized is well justified from the decision-support perspective.
With the proposed decision-making approach, a full specifica-tion for the general optimum design problem has to include the loading and geometry conditions, but beyond engineering terms also the cost basis and exploitation conditions. Two examples are presented to demonstrate that the optimum shape of a product is a consequence of both technical and commercial parameters. References
