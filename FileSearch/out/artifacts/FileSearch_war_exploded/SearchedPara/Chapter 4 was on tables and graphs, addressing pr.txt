 Chapter 4 was on tables and graphs, addressing primarily the basics of each type of presentation style.
Chapter 5 deals with summarizing and the ability to make general statements about statistical data, addressing descriptive, inferential, and comparative approaches.

Chapter 6 addresses the importance of grouping data in order to find hidden relationships, to become famil-iar with the data, and simplification of data. Several clustering approaches were discussed from a conceptual aspect. There was little presentation on automated tools to accomplish large-scale data analysis, data mining, or text mining.

Chapter 7 dealt with predictive models on data where estimates or forecasting is needed. The author touches on the use of predictive models for prioritization, decision support, and understanding relationships.
Chapter 8 concerned the deployment aspects of a data analysis project, including the deliverables (i.e., re-ports integration into existing systems, and standalone software). This chapter also dealt with the specific activities involved in the deployment phase, including the planning, the executing, measuring progress, and monitoring performance. The chapter ended with brief discussions of possible deployment scenarios.
Chapter 9 presented an overview of the exploratory data analysis process, namely reviewing the four steps outlined in the project management process, which are problem definition, data preparation, implementation of the analysis, and deployment.

The book ends with some statistical tables. It has a seven page glossary that is actually quite useful. The book has a wholly inadequate bibliography of one and half pages. The index is a little more than five pages.
Overall, the idea of embedding data analysis and mining within a project management approach was inter-esting, and the combination certainly has merit. However, the book really fell short in both areas. I did not find it useful as a statistical analysis references  X  and certainly not as a data mining reference  X , and it was lacking in the project management area. The book tries to be a reference for both areas, and it ends up do neither well.
 Paradigms lost: The life and deaths of the printed word, William Sonn. The Scarecrow Press (2006). 398 pp., ISBN-13: 978-0-8108-5262-4; ISBN-10: 0-8108-5262-4, $35
The term disruptive technology or innovation was popularized by Harvard Business School professor Clay-ton Christensen. 1 It is often used to denote that which alters the course of a life, an industry, or a whole soci-ety. William Sonn X  X  book convinces us that all of the  X  X  X echnology X  X  associated over the years with the spread of the printed word, or more accurately recorded knowledge, is the perfect example of a disruptive technology.
This extensively researched book is a history primarily of the  X  X  X rinted word X  X . It gives us an insight into the profound effect of access to information on humankind and the society in which we live. No dry academic treatise on the history of printing and publishing, this is a living, human history that also gives insight into many other issues like labor representation and women X  X  participation in the workforce.

William Sonn, the author is a writer and marketer and an independent historian. He has written for a vari-ety of newspapers and magazines. Having been involved in the communications and publishing business for many years, he is eminently qualified to write a book like this. Sonn X  X  interest in the publishing industry and love for the subject shines through in this book making this a most interesting and enjoyable read.
The book is organized into four parts which represent different periods in the development of printing tech-nology. Part I consisting of six chapters, is entitled  X  X  X he Birth of Type: From Hand to Lever X  X  and represents the period from the years before 4000 B.C.E. to the early 1600s. Part II comprised of seven chapters, is entitled  X  X  X he Type Age: From Lever to Machine X  X  and describes the period from about the mid 1600s to the early 1900s. Part III,  X  X  X he End of Type: From Machine to Math X  X  consists of eight chapters covering the period to the mid 1980s and Part IV,  X  X  X ife after Type X  X  consists of four chapters which takes us to the present infor-mation age. The book ends with a 26 page bibliography and is further enhanced by the inclusion of a useful 13 page index. Additionally, each chapter includes comprehensive notes and references from a diverse collection of sources, e.g., newspapers, autobiographies, traditional scholarly historical publications, online discussion group messages, websites and dissertations.

The introductory chapter entitled interestingly  X  X  X eter Printing Pants in Linotype Hell, 1993 X  X  is in the form of a story. It starts with:
The reader who is ready for the history of printing wonders if somehow we have started reading the wrong book! By the next page we realize that we are indeed in the right place. The character Louis Felicio apparently used to fix  X  X  X lanking machines called hot-metal typesetters X  X  (p. 2). This is Sonn X  X  way of bringing to life the effects that printing technology and technology generally have on human beings and society. This  X  X  X tory-telling X  X  technique is more effective than dry statements about technology X  X  impact. We are told about the familiar fast paced changes in technology resulting in  X  X  X ommercial carnage X  X  when businesses did not have time to depreciate the equipment and pay for it before it became obsolete.

Chapter 1 sets the stage for this easy to read book and establishes its premise. The central premise is that the method by which knowledge is recorded (printing) determines the extent of its dissemination (knowledge for an elite or wide access). This in turn changes peoples X  way of thinking, creates new ideas and inventions, fos-tering new societies, new types of governance and development and creates  X  X  X pheavals X  X  in society and people.
The books traces the  X  X  X ives X  X  of the printed word from its birth to its many evolutions in form. The  X  X  X rinted word X  X  Sonn shows us is much like the mythological Phoenix that consumed itself by fire every 500 years giving rise to a new one that sprang from its ashes. Sonn traces the repeated death of the  X  X  X rinted word X  X  in one form and its re-awakening in another. We see the  X  X  X rinted X  X  word move from hieroglyphics on cave walls to hieratic scripts on papyrus to alphabetic characters on paper to the digital words that travel globally and instantly along the World Wide Web. Each new form gives rise to  X  X  X ords X  X  or information that becomes accessible to an ever expanding number of people.

We are educated, intrigued and entertained by this book. We are told about such well-known personalities as Vannevar Bush, Steve Wozniak, Steven Jobs, Bill Gates and Tim Berners-Lee and their contributions to the spread of the  X  X  X rinted X  X  word. We read with interest about the well-known author Mark Twain spending al-most his entire fortune on a typesetting machine which had 18,000 moving parts! The machine apparently took 6 years to develop and flopped, forcing Twain to return to writing to get out of debt.

The reader comes to understand how the elites who once were the necessary intermediaries between man and knowledge (the printed word) would be threatened by innovations that gave more people access to that information. Thus in chapter 7, entitled  X  X  X aster than Asparagus X  X  we read that each time the spread of the printed word gained speed there were violent attempts to control the spread which were aimed at maintaining  X  X  X onopolies over crucial political, commercial, spiritual, or military information X  X  which was central to some group X  X  power. This was done by either trying to control the  X  X  X ord X  X  production and distribution X  X  or some-times to  X  X  X xterminate those who read on their own X  X  (p. 83).
We are surprised at the very early origins of the phenomenon of banning books and censorship. For exam-ple, as early as 1529, Henry VIII in England  X  X  X fficially limited the printing, importing, or reading of certain books. The penalty was nothing less than imprisonment or death. X  X  (p. 84). Also in 1571, Pope Pius V pro-duced an official list of banned books that was called the Index Expurgatorius. The consequence of reading any of the banned books on this list was  X  X  X ternal damnation X  X  (p. 85).

The development of intellectual property protection from the very early years when there was absolutely no protection is also described. For example, we read about unauthorized copies of a book by Luther on German nationhood published in 1522 which  X  X  X utnumbered authorized ones by 90 to one X  X  (p. 88).
 Sonn gives us an insight into early organized labor and industrial relations in both Europe and the United
States. We are fascinated to read about the early apprenticeship systems and the tensions between employer and employee that apparently existed much earlier than one would have guessed. The constant tension be-tween employer and employee for increased productivity on the one hand and better wages and benefits on the other is presented by the use of real-life examples of  X  X  X abor wars X  X .

We also read that in 1888, the major printing union, the International Typographical Union (ITU) saw their membership threatened with replacement by machines. Instead of resisting the inevitable change brought about by  X  X  X readed technology X  X , the ITU decided to remake itself and encourage its members to learn to use the new  X  X  X inotype X  X  machines. The ITU had in fact embraced automation-investing heavily in retraining its people. Thus a major union even in those early years when facing the threat of the loss of jobs because of new technology was visionary enough to try new strategies to react to the change.

Those interested in the history of women in the workforce will find some fascinating tidbits of information in this book. Sonn reveals that the constant battle over the years by employers to replace unionized men by cheaper labor often meant considering women as the alternative. We also read about economists attributing the stark decline in American organized labor since the 1950s to  X  X  X he increasing numbers of union-shy women in low-skilled, white-collar production jobs X  X  (p. 262).

Over the years Sonn describes innovations in paper, printing technology and distribution which reduced the cost of information significantly. For example, he describes how a sophisticated postal system and develop-ments in the printing press resulted in the spread of newspapers and a drop in their price making these afford-able to everyone. The price of newspapers fell to a penny in the United States by 1830!
For many, a book of this length on a subject like printing would be difficult to read but Sonn knows just when to interject some interesting account that grips the reader X  X  attention. For example, we read of an aspir-ing publisher called Daniel Fanshaw who in 1836:
Sonn also presents the reader with real-life examples of how scientific discovery is facilitated by having ready access to information. We read of Wilhelm Roentgen publishing a paper about the discovery of X-rays in 1895 and only one year later X-rays being used to take pictures and two years later being used as diagnostic tools in US army hospitals.

Sonn goes on to describe the rapid growth of computer technology in printing establishments with a quo-tation from a publisher in 1964 describing the computer typesetter as  X  X  X omething like a Minsky blonde-it X  X  big, it X  X  stupid and, my God, it X  X  fast! X  X  (p. 241).

Sonn takes us on a long journey where we see how the use of new forms of technology changed the way that the  X  X  X ord X  X  is  X  X  X rinted X  X , reproduced or disseminated. He finally gets to the present era of cell phones, pocket computers, in-car navigational devices, smart bombs, CDs and DVDs. Individuals can now produce their own work and print it on computers that fit on a desktop or a laptop. Sonn describes the dire warnings about the  X  X  X aperless society X  X  which was supposed to take place by the year 2000. Yet amazingly, by then print manu-facturing was the sixth largest industry globally!
The very interesting chapter entitled  X  X  X ne Last Transaction Cost X  X  describes the beginnings of the Internet (Chapter 25). The last important transaction in the life of the printed word (distributing it) had been reduced to almost zero with the coming of the Internet.
 In chapter 26,  X  X  X he Descent into Free X  X , we read with interest about the coming to life of new journals like
Infoworld in 1980, PC Magazine in 1982 and Wired in 1993. With the appearance of the World Wide Web individuals were now not only producing and reproducing printed information on their own, but now  X  X  X heir written personal communicating reached literally ethereal speeds X  X  (p. 335). Everyone was now a writer and everyone a publisher. Yet in all of this explosion of digital information, according to Sonn, information still remained as a printed product since  X  X  X aper was everywhere X  X  (p. 337).

This excellent book by Sonn therefore makes us realize that we are in an era that is really not unique in terms of the information explosion and widened access to information and the associated consequences.
The uniqueness is possibly only in the degree of the information explosion. There have been other eras where access to information by individuals was expanded, where elite intermediaries between knowledge and individ-uals had been eliminated, causing upheaval, significant changes in man and society and speculation about the demise of civilization as we know it (the demise of books, of libraries and so on).

On coming to the end of this book, we can almost imagine a sequel where Sonn would address the open access movement, changes in scholarly communication and the effect of the  X  X  X reeing X  X  of the published word on publishers and researchers. This intriguing book is highly recommended to the readers of Information Processing and Management.

This is the first sentence of the first chapter of the first part of the book. The Wealth of Networks  X  How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom, by Professor Yochai Benkler. Professor Benkler is the
Joseph M. Field  X 55 Professor of Law at Yale. This book should be on your summer reading list if you care about information technology, the digital global economy and their affects on society at large. Wealth of Networks is a remarkable book by any measure. The coverage is quite complete and up-to-date.
From SETI@home, Slashdot, Wikipedia, and the war in Iraq to some of the latest and most relevant court cases, Benkler connects the dots masterfully and comprehensively. Each chapter includes a full set of citations to scholarly and other works that alone is worth the price of the book. His central thesis is that non-market forces have always been a source of innovation. One need only look to the industrial research centers of the latter 20th century operated by corporations such as General Electric, Bell Telephone, DuPont, and Mobil Oil for evidence of mostly cloistered, proprietary research laboratories dedicated to invention and innovation but with enormous overhead costs and capital investments.

Today, driven by the Web and Internet, social, or commons production, based on information can be done anywhere, anytime by almost anyone and this activity has and will radically reshape market places and econ-omies because it is non-proprietary and requires so little capital investment. Yes, some market giants, have
