 Climate change is a pressing focus of researc h, social and economic concern, and political atten tion. According to the Fourth Assessmen t Rep ort of the Intergo vernmen tal Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), increased frequency of extreme events will only intensify the occurrence of natural hazards, a ecting global population, health, and economies. It is of keen interest to iden tify \regions" of similar climatological beha vior to disco ver spatial relationships in climate vari-ables, including long-range teleconnections. To that end, we consider a complex net works-based represen tation of climate data. Cross correlation is used to weigh t net work edges, thus resp ecting the temp oral nature of the data, and a comm u-nity detection algorithm iden ti es multiv ariate clusters. Ex-amining net works for consecutiv e perio ds allo ws us to study structural changes over time. We sho w that comm unities have a climatological interpretation and that disturbances in structure can be an indicator of climate events (or lack thereof ). Finally , we discuss how this mo del can be applied for the disco very of more complex concepts suc h as unkno wn teleconnections or the dev elopmen t of multiv ariate climate indices and predictiv e insigh ts. Iden tifying and analyzing patterns in global climate is im-portan t because it helps scien tists dev elop a deep er under-standing of the complex pro cesses con tributing to observ ed phenomena. One interesting task is the disco very of climate regions (areas that exhibit similar climatological beha vior, e.g., [14]), whic h has been addressed with various clustering metho ds. While k-means [5; 7] works well with multiv ariate data, it is limited to nding clusters of relativ ely uniform size and densit y, while largely ignoring the temp oral nature of the domain.
 Alternate clustering approac hes have been explored to ad-dress the space-time asp ect of the data, including a weigh ted k-means kernel with spatial constrain ts [17] and a shared-nearest neigh bor metho d to disco ver climate indic es [24] from sea surface temp erature data [18]. However, none of these approac hes pro vides a means for explicitly iden tifying clusters from multiv ariate spatio-temp oral data. In this pap er, we consider a di eren t persp ectiv e on analyz-ing climate data. Instead of clustering based on univ ariate similarit y or spatial pro ximit y, we mo del the data as a net-work of inter acting nodes [21]. We map the spatio-temp oral grid to a net work and use a cross correlation-b ased measur e of similarity on climatic variables to created weigh ted edges (or connections) between them. Edge placemen t is deter-mined only by the relationship among variables and is not sub ject to spatial constrain ts; a comm unit y detection algo-rithm disco vers clusters corresp onding to climate regions. This net work view captures complex relationships and is able to iden tify patterns that span both space and time. The concept of complex net works has been used to deriv e in-teresting climate insigh ts. For example, [19] and [23] found that changes in net work structure give predictiv e insigh ts about El Ni~ no events. A net work of di eren t climate in-dices was used to explain ma jor climate shifts of the 20th cen tury as transitions between di eren t equilibria of oscilla-tors represen ting the earth system [20]. While all of these studies were hypothesis-driv en, we believ e that similar in-novations are also possible with resp ect to the disco very of climate regions using a data-driv en approac h. We also sho w that comm unities have a climatological interpretation and that disturbances in structure can be an indicator of cli-mate events (or lack thereof ). Finally , we discuss how this mo del can be applied for the disco very of more complex con-cepts suc h as unkno wn teleconnections or the dev elopmen t of multiv ariate climate indices and predictiv e insigh ts. In section 2 we introduce the dataset used for this study . Section 3 describ es the metho dology in detail, and the em-pirical evaluation is presen ted in section 4. We conclude with a discussion placing this work in the broader con text of climate science and iden tifying directions for future work. The Earth science data for our analysis stems from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis pro ject [10], whic h is publicly ac-cessible for download at [26]. This dataset is constructed by fusing and assimilating measuremen ts from heterogeneous remote and in-situ sensors. Variable selection is an imp or-tan t issue in this con text, one we have not yet fully explored. Previous researc h has relied on domain exp ertise for an ap-propriate selection [19; 21; 23]; alternativ ely, an objectiv e feature selection approac h could be used.
 For the purp ose of this study , we selected four variables with the guidance of a domain exp ert: air temp erature, pres-sure, relativ e humidit y, and precipitable water, available at mon thly interv als for a perio d of 60 years from 1948 to 2007 (720 points).
 Temp erature and pressure were chosen because they are two key variables in terms of signi cance, for example in de n-ing climate regions [14] or in determining indices that may act as predictors [18; 19; 23]. Precipitation is another vari-able of great imp ortance, but it is kno wn to be inaccurate in reanalysis pro ducts due to its inheren tly large space-time variabilit y [9]. Therefore, we use relativ e humidit y and pre-cipitable water as surrogates because these variables are rel-ativ ely more stable and reliable in the reanalysis data [10]. Measuremen ts are pro vided for points (grid cells) at a reso-lution of 2 : 5 2 : 5 on a latitude-longitude spherical grid. Figure 1 sho ws a sample time series for eac h variable at the grid point closest to Paris, France (47.5 N 2.5 E). In this section, we describ e the ma jor comp onen ts of our metho dology: using cross correlation to de ne a measure of similarit y between locations, constructing the weigh ted climate net work, iden tifying comm unities of interest, and studying their beha vior over time.
 Figure 2 pro vides an overview of our approac h; algorithm details, including pseudo code, are pro vided in Section 3.5. Various metho ds have been used for clustering climate data, and underlying eac h approac h is some type of measure that de nes the distance or, con versely , the similarity between two points. Traditional measures suc h as Euclidean [7] and Mahalanobis [5] distance have been emplo yed in climate ap-plications. But these may not be the most appropriate for high-dimensional and noisy data, or when clusters of varying densit y are kno wn to exist within the data. To coun ter these problems, [4] prop oses to de ne similarit y locally based on the num ber of nearest neigh bors two points share, whic h was demonstrated to pro vide good results with univ ariate climate data.
 In the presen t application, eac h data point represen ts a phys-ical location (grid cell) for whic h we have four separate time series corresp onding to the four climate variables, and none of the aforemen tioned distance measures can tak e full ad-vantage of the information con tained therein. Therefore, we prop ose to de ne a new feature space based on the correla-tions between the four time series at eac h point, and simi-larit y between locations is then measured as distance within this space.
 Let AT , P R , RH , and P W denote the time series for air temp erature, pressure, relativ e humidit y, and precipitable water, resp ectiv ely, and let t denote the num ber of data points in eac h series. Then, for any two series A and B the cross correlation function CCF at dela y d is computed as where a i is the i th value in series A and a is the mean of all values in the series. Note that the correlation coecien t ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect agreemen t and -1 perfect disagreemen t, while 0 indicates that no correla-tion is presen t at all. Since an inverse relationship is equally relev ant in this application, we tak e the absolute value of the cross correlation function. In addition, cognizan t that some climate phenomena may occur with some lag (i.e., at di er-ent times in di eren t places), we accoun t for this possibilit y by computing the cross correlation function for dela ys in the range 6 &lt; d &lt; +6 mon ths and tak e the largest (absolute) value to be the correlation between A and B .
 Giv en the above de nition, we now compute the correla-tion between all pairs of variables (time series) at eac h lo-cation, in this case 4 2 = 6 pairs. This results in a new 6-dimensional feature space wherein eac h grid cell is repre-sen ted as a point de ned by the correlations between climate variables at the corresp onding location, as follo ws:
R 6 = h CCF ( AT ; P R ) ; CCF ( AT ; RH ) ; CCF ( AT ; P W ) ; Figure 3: Distribution of edge weigh ts in the cross correlation-based net work for the perio d 1948-1952. Our measure for similarit y between two grid cells is then de ned as the Euclidean distance in this new R 6 space, so that the inter action betwe en variables at each location { as opp osed to the beha vior of a single variable { de nes the strength of the relationship between locations. Having de ned a similarit y measure that maps our four time series corresp onding to the four climate variables into Eu-clidean space, we could apply k-means or a similar clustering metho d to cluster grid cells into poten tial climate regions. However, this approac h would neither solv e the problem of data represen tation nor would it address the issues men-tioned earlier, namely , that the data is noisy , con tains clus-ters of varying densities, and may change with time. Instead, we prop ose to construct net works from the climate data by dividing the time series into 5-y ear windo ws, so that twelve separate net works are available to study changes in structure over time. The net work for eac h windo w is then constructed as follo ws. Let eac h grid cell be a node in the net work. For eac h pair of nodes create an edge and assign it a weigh t equal to the correlation-based similarit y describ ed in section 3.1. This will result in a fully connected net work (i.e., one gian t clique) consisting of over ten thousand nodes and more than 55 million edges. The concept of a comm u-nity is naturally absen t here, so the next step is to prune away man y of the edges in order for structure to emerge. Of course we want to eliminate edges in a principled manner, and the edge weigh ts allo w us to do just that. As illustrated in Figure 3, the histogram of edge weigh ts in the complete net work (1948-1952 sho wn) follo ws a unimo dal distribution { the exact shap e is irrelev ant here. What is imp ortan t is the presence of only a few edges with very high weigh t (in the righ t tail), and it is precisely those strongest edges that de ne the fundamen tal structure of the net work. Therefore, we prune away 99% of the edges, retaining only the top 1 percen tile by weigh t (this may seem extreme, but it still leaves over a half million edges intact).
 After performing this pro cedure in eac h windo w, we obtain twelve climate net works for analysis. In the next section, we brie y describ e the comm unit y detection pro cess and demonstrate why correlation-based similarit y is necessary to iden tify interesting clusters.
 Giv en a set of net works constructed from the climate data as describ ed above, we can now use comm unit y detection to iden tify regions of interest. A variet y of algorithms with di eren t characteristics have been prop osed and applied in a num ber of settings including social net works [15], protein interaction net works [1], and food webs [2]. Tw o criteria dro ve our selection of an appropriate algorithm: (i) due to the relativ ely high net work densit y it must be computation-ally ecien t, and (ii) it must have the abilit y to consider weigh ted net works. Based on these requiremen ts we chose an algorithm called WalkT rap , whic h is grounded in the in-tuition that random walks in a net work are more likely to remain within the same comm unit y than to cross comm unit y boundaries; for algorithm details see [16]. To our kno wledge, this is the rst time comm unit y detection has been used on net works constructed from spatio-temp oral data.
 We applied the WalkT rap algorithm to eac h of the twelve net works using the default parameter of walk length t = 4. A sample visualization of the comm unities 20 nodes for the rst perio d is sho wn in Figure 4(a). Note that they vary widely in both shap e and size, and man y of them are spatially disjoin t. To illustrate the implications of di eren t edge weigh tings we also constructed a net work from air tem-perature alone, where similarit y is de ned as the maxim um cross correlation ( 6 mon ths) between the time series for two locations. Figure 4(b) depicts comm unities 20 nodes in this net work. While these may be more pleasing to the eye (primarily due to their spatial cohesion), they are also less interesting because they merely sho w areas where temp er-atures are similar. In fact, more elemen tary measures suc h as ann ual means, ranges, or the presence/absence of seasons should be sucien t to iden tify these kinds of patterns. This result is nonetheless encouraging as it demonstrates that the net work represen tation is capable of discerning simple pat-terns suc h as univ ariate climate regions, but our ultimate goal is to disco ver more complex patterns. Since we are interested in the beha vior of comm unities over time, our last task is to extract only those whic h can be trac ked through sev eral consecutiv e windo ws. Comm unit y trac king in dynamic net works can itself be a challenging problem [8], but in this application the follo wing metho d pro ved sucien t. For eac h comm unit y C t;i lab eled i at time step s , maximize the quan tity s.t. In other words, nd the corresp onding comm unit y lab eled j at time s + 1 with whic h it shares the most nodes. If less than 50% of the nodes in the comm unit y change between time steps, then the comm unit y is said to persist and we can reasonably assume that there is con tinuity; otherwise we consider there to be insucien t evidence for trac king and the comm unit y is discarded. This pro cess is rep eated for all time steps s = 1 ; 2 ; :::; 11 until all \trac kable" comm unities have been iden ti ed. The pseudo code for our metho dology is sho wn in Algorithm 1, divided into its three ma jor stages: computation of cross correlation-based similarities between locations (lines 1-14), systematic pruning of edges (15-23), and comm unit y detec-tion and trac king over multiple time perio ds (24-35). The pro cedure tak es as input a spatio-temp oral climate dataset and pro duces as output the progression of all comm unities deemed trac kable.
 It is apparen t from the pseudo code that the computational complexit y of the algorithm is quite high. For the rst stage, the dominan t operation is the nested loop beginning on line 4. Using a simpli ed notation where n = lat lon is the total num ber of grid cells, this loop has a complexit y of O ( n 2 v 2 t ), so that the pro cessing requiremen ts increase quadratically with the num ber of points as well as the num-ber of variables. Giv en that the complete net work con tains Algorithm 1 Comm unit y Detection in a Climate Net work.

The third stage of the pro cedure is bounded by the WalkT rap algorithm, also O ( n 2 log n ) [16]. There-fore, the overall complexit y of the end-to-end comm unit y detection pro cedure is O ( n 2 v 2 t ) + O ( n 2 log n ). Note that in practice, a vast ma jorit y of the total execution time is spent in the rst stage. In fact, the rst stage took appro ximately 1,200 CPU hours (24 hours on 50 mac hines) to complete, whereas the second and third stages com bined only required 2 CPU hours (on a single mac hine). Here we presen t sev eral examples of comm unities iden ti ed using the metho dology describ ed in Section 3, along with further analysis and poten tial interpretations based on un-derlying climate phenomena. For space reasons we limit ourselv es to the four comm unities sho wn in Figure 6, eac h covering ve consecutiv e windo ws (25 years). But before we delv e deep er into the discussion, let us rst de ne a measure of densit y that enables us to determine the relativ e strength of individual comm unities at di eren t time steps. The structural prop erties of clusters, or comm unities, are an imp ortan t tool to better characterize them and detect changes over time. One prop erty that is frequen tly consid-ered is cluster densit y, and man y algorithms implicitly (or even explicitly) measure densit y as part of the clustering pro cess. Comm unit y detection is di eren t in that the den-sity of an individual cluster cannot be measured directly . Therefore, we de ne an alternate measure to estimate den-sity of comm unities based on the distribution of edges in-stead.
 Let n and e be the total num ber of nodes and edges in the net work, resp ectiv ely; similarly , let n i denote the num ber of nodes in comm unit y C i and e i the num ber of edges between nodes in this comm unit y. The densit y of comm unit y C then de ned as the ratio of the num ber of within-comm unit y edges to the exp ected num ber of edges based on densit y of the net work as a whole, We validated this metho d by comparing the densit y distri-bution of 30 \true" comm unities (iden ti ed in our net work) with random comm unities as well as \an ti-comm unities", chosen from di eren t true comm unities in a round-robin fashion. As sho wn in Figure 5, the anti-comm unities have a densit y less than 1 and the random comm unities have a den-sity between 1 and 2, while the densit y of the true comm u-nities ranges from 8 to 152. It is generally true that higher densit y is an indication of more interesting comm unities, but a domain exp ert should assist in making this determination. The rst comm unit y, sho wn in Figure 6(a), spans the years 1963-1987 and is relativ ely small, ranging from appro xi-mately 25 to 50 nodes. Nonetheless, it consisten tly covers spatially stable regions on three di eren t con tinen ts and is one of the most dense comm unities overall.
 In terms of physical interpretation, the areas included in comm unit y 1 belong either to the equatorial win ter dry (South America, Africa) or monso onal (South-East Asia) climate zones. Giv en the subset of variables we considered here, it is likely that the strong inverse relationship (negativ e corre-lation) between the hydrological patterns in the two regions { extremely dry conditions versus intense rainfall/monso ons during the summer mon ths { are at least partially resp onsi-ble for the emergence of this comm unit y. The second comm unit y in Figure 6(b) spans the years 1948-1972 and, with the exception of the fourth windo w (1963), consists of appro ximately 150 to 220 nodes. Muc h like the rst comm unit y, it is comp osed (primarily) of equatorial win ter dry and (relativ ely few er) monso on regions, speci -cally in Northern India. What mak es this comm unit y inter-esting is that signi can t change in structure occurs in 1963, whic h is visually detectable but also manifests itself as a de-crease in densit y. A closer look at the net work rev eals that the comm unit y merged with a larger comm unit y con taining a num ber of desert locations, only to separate again in the follo wing perio d. Since tropical climate di ers from deserts mainly in precipitation, we postulate that the monso on sea-sons during this time were unusually weak, thereb y becom-ing more similar and causing the two to temp orarily merge. Indeed, there is some indication that the monso on pattern altered sligh tly during the 1960s [3; 6]. We cannot attribute the change in structure to this climate phenomenon with certain ty, but [20] also link ed changes in net work structure to climate shifts. The third and most recen t comm unit y, depicted in Fig-ure 6(c), spans the years 1983-2007. It is dominated by temp erate and humid climate but also con tains some drier mediterranean regions, and decreases from appro ximately 2,200 down to 800 nodes. Once again, the decreasing size is accompanied with a sligh t increase in densit y. Giv en that a ma jorit y of the locations in the rst time step lie the Southern Ocean, it is possible that the reduction in net-work size is the result of warming trends observ ed in these areas. However, a strong relationship remains between the Weddell Sea and much of the Europ ean con tinen t as well as parts of North America, prompting the question whether this ocean region migh t be a source for a climate index and exhibit some predictiv e capabilities. This last comm unit y, sho wn in Figure 6(d), also spans the years 1963-1987. It is quite dense, indicating a strong rela-tionship between the locations, but the underlying mec ha-nism is non-ob vious in this case. A large num ber of areas are either polar tundra (Greenland, Antarctica) or located in moun tain ranges (Ro cky Moun tains, Andes, Himala yas), but there are also locations in South America, Cen tral Asia, and Australia that defy both of these categorizations. It is possible that the strong relationship arises from an in-verse relationship between temp erature and precipitation, but that statemen t is purely speculativ e at this point. What we kno w is that teleconnections do exist and, ultimately , suc h unexplained patterns can help guide the dev elopmen t of new analysis metho ds. Here we place this exploratory study in the broader con text of climate science. We expand upon kno wn issues relating to data and metho dology , point out curren t capabilities and limitations, and discuss poten tial extensions. The presen t work examines gridded reanalysis data, the best estimate of a global historical climate record. However, it is worth noting sev eral factors to keep in mind when using this type of data. For one, reanalysis data is comp osed from multiple heterogeneous sources including satellite, remotely sensed, and in-situ measuremen ts. These raw inputs are com bined by tting a mo del to the data, whic h inheren tly results in some smo othing. In addition, values are interp o-lated to a regular grid, further reducing variabilit y as well as precision. This was not a concern here as cross correla-tion measures relativ ely long-term trends, but it could have serious implications if we were comparing other indicators suc h as climate extremes, for example.
 Lik ewise, the selection of variables may signi can tly a ect comm unit y structure and needs to be considered when in-terpreting the results. As discussed in Section 2, we chose four variables that are strongly indicativ e of certain climate phenomena, and we inten tionally avoided variables that are kno wn to be problematic (e.g., precipitation) In the future, we plan to investigate the variable selection problem more thoroughly and answ er suc h questions as, How does the com-munit y structure change by adding/remo ving a variable? Can these changes be explained by the presence/absence of that variable? And how to select an optimal subset of variables for a given task? Lastly , we note that reanalysis pro ducts are not the only type of climate data. In some cases actual observ ations (e.g., thermometer, rain gauge) or at least higher-resolution gridded datasets are available for smaller geographic regions. Climate mo dels represen t another viable source of data, and comparing observ ations with mo del hindcasts may be one valuable exercise as di erences between the two may pro-vide some insigh ts into the mo del bias. The cross correlation-based similarit y between locations pro-posed here is a rather complex measure, esp ecially in terms of interpreting and relating comm unities bac k to the data. In fact, when faced with the problem of clustering climate data there are a host of other measures one migh t consider rst, including averages and ranges, anomalies from long-term means, presence of seasonalit y, or (auto)correlation in space and time. But much prior work has been done us-ing these measures, esp ecially for univ ariate data, and the results are well understo od. Instead, we went beyond these con ventional boundaries to explore an inno vativ e, multiv ari-ate measure of correlation. In the future, we intend to in-vestigate other similarit y measures in this con text. For in-stance, non-linear relationships are kno wn to exist between climate variables [13], but most correlation measures assume linear dep endence. Using the framew ork presen ted here, we can substitute a non-linear measure [12] and poten tially nd very di eren t comm unities. We envision that a com bination of simple (mean, seasonalit y) and more complex (cross cor-relation, non-linear dep endence) measures could eventually be used to disco ver a variet y of patterns in climate data. We want to impress upon the reader once again the speci c bene ts of our net work metho dology over traditional clus-tering approac hes suc h as k-means. First, k-means is kno wn to perform poorly on noisy and high-dimensional data [4]. However, even if the correlation-based similarit y were used as a distance measure, k-means would be unable to nd certain comm unities. For example, it may not capture tran-sitiv e relationships like \if A is similar to B and B is similar to C, then A is also similar to C" in the same way a net work can, and comm unit y detection algorithms leverage this in-formation to nd more meaningful climate regions. While this pap er presen ts but a few examples, we will further ex-plore the parameter space, di eren t clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, spectral), varying windo w sizes and a more extensiv e evaluation of robustness to changes [11]. As discussed in Section 3.5, calculating all-pairs similarit y is an exp ensiv e operation: computing cross correlation for 10,000 grid cells with twelve 5-y ear windo ws of four vari-ables took 1,200 CPU hours. However, eac h of these dimen-sions could conceiv ably gro w and drastically increase prob-lem size. There has been a consisten t trend towards higher resolution, both for reanalysis data and climate mo del out-puts. The presen t study used a 2 : 5 2 : 5 grid, but spacings of 1 or less are quic kly becoming the norm. Second, reanal-ysis and mo del data con tain dozens of variables. For this study we relied on a domain exp ert to select a subset, but using additional variables or, worse yet, exploring a large subspace of them may not be feasible. Finally , it should also be noted that mo del outputs, and to some exten t even observ ations, are available for much longer time perio ds. Giv en that the complexit y of our metho d is O ( n 2 v O ( n 2 log n ), even relativ ely small changes in dataset size will have noticeable consequences. For example, if the grid spacing decreases by a factor of two, there will be four times as man y cells, whic h in turn means computational require-men ts will gro w by a factor of 16. Therefore, all the afore-men tioned issues must be considired when designing exp er-imen ts, lest the execution time becomes intractable. This work was supp orted in part by the NSF Gran t 0826958.
