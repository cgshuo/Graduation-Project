 Man y bioinformatics applications would benefit from comparing proteins based on their biological role rather than their sequence. In most biological databases, proteins are already annotated with ontology terms. Pre vious studies identified a correlation between the sequence similarity and the semantic similarity of proteins. The semantic similarity of proteins was computed from their annotated GO terms. Ho we ver, proteins sharing a biological role do not nec-essarily have a similar sequence.

This paper introduces our study of the correlation between GO and family similarity . Family similarity overcomes some of the limitations of sequence similarity , thus we obtained a strong corre-lation between GO and family similarity . Additionally , this paper introduces GraSM, a novel method that uses all the information in the graph structure of the GO, instead of considering it as a hi-erarchical tree. When calculating the semantic similarity of two concepts, GraSM selects the disjuncti ve common ancestors rather than only using the most informati ve common ancestor . GraSM produced a higher family similarity correlation than the original semantic similarity measures.

Given the increasing importance of biological ontologies, mech-anisms enabling users to measure the similarity between the con-cepts or, by extension, between the entities annotated with these concepts are required. For example, the y can be applied to impro ve text mining systems [3, 7]. GO (Gene Ontology) has become one of the most important ontologies to annotate proteins. GO pro vides a structured controlled vocab ulary of gene and protein biological roles describing the follo wing aspects: function, process and com-ponent.

Man y SS (Semantic Similarity) measures applied to ontologies have been proposed. Resnik defined a SS measure based on the in-formation content of the most informati ve common ancestor [8]. Jiang&amp;Conrath proposed a semantic distance measure based on the dif ference between the information content of the concepts and the ontology not used by the other paths. Therefore, two disjuncti ve ancestors of a concept represent two distinct interpretations of a concept. Calculating the similarity between two concepts using just the most informati ve common ancestor only accounts for one of the interpretations. Ho we ver, similarity measures should also account for other interpretations of both concepts.

GraSM selects all the common disjuncti ve ancestors of two con-cepts in a DAG to calculate their similarity . GraSM considers that a and a 2 represent disjuncti ve ancestors of c if there is a path from a to c not passing through a 2 and a path from a 2 to c not passing through a 1 : Given two concepts c 1 and c 2 , their common disjuncti ve ancestors are the most informati ve common ancestor of disjuncti ve ancestors of c 1 and c 2 , i.e. a 1 is a common disjuncti ve ancestor of c 1 and c if for each ancestor a 2 more informati ve than a 1 , a 1 and a 2 are disjuncti ve ancestors of c 1 or c 2 :
CommonDis jAnc ( c 1 ; c 2 ) = f a 1 j
Original SS measures consider the shared information between two concepts c 1 and c 2 as the information content of the most infor -mati ve common ancestor . GraSM replaces this notion by defining the shared information as the average of the information content of the common disjuncti ve ancestors:
We evaluated the performance of each SS measure based on the correlation between GO and family similarity . We defined the GO similarity between two proteins as the average SS of the GO terms annotated to them. Ho we ver, since proteins have simultaneous bi-ological roles, for each term annotated to a protein we compared it only with the most similar term annotated to the other protein. We tested the 500 proteins with the lar gest number of GO annotations from the December 2004 release of Uniprot and GO.

Table 1 presents the correlation coef ficients obtained by all SS measures. The results sho w a strong correlation between GO and family similarity . The correlation coef ficients obtained in our study are not directly comparable to the ones obtained by Lord et al., since we are measuring a dif ferent correlation using more recent UniProt and GO releases. Ho we ver, our study obtained a mea-sures X  ranking that is preserv ed in all the aspects of GO and con-sistent with pre vious studies using dif ferent corpora [1]. In all as-pects, Jiang&amp;Conrath X  s measure have always obtained the strongest correlation, and Lin X  s measure have always obtained a stronger or equi valent correlation than Resnik X  s measure. This uniformity and
