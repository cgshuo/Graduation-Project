 1. Introduction
An autopilot is a ship's steering controller, which automatically manipulates the rudder to decrease the errors between the desired and the actual course of ships. It is necessary device and directly in fl uences the maneuverability, economy and security of ship navigation and the combat capacity of warships ( Huang, 1992 ). Following the invention of the gyrocompass, the fi rst automatic ship steering mechanism is constructed in 1911, where the course of the ship was measured by a gyrocompass. In 1922, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) autopilot for ship steering was presented by Nicholas Minosky ( Fossen, 2000 ). PID controllers greatly improved the performance of autopilots. Until the 1980s almost all makes of autopilots were based on these controllers. Many advanced control algorithms, such as modern optimal and adaptive control ( Amerongen, 1984 ) and neural network adaptive control ( Unar and Murray-Smith, 1999 ; Yang, 1994 ), have been applied in ship course control since 1980s. Recently, the novel disturbance compensating model predictive control (DC-MPC) algorithm was proposed and successfully applied to the ship heading control in the presence of environmental disturbances with yaw velocity constraints in ( Li and Sun, 2012 ). The simulation results show the good performance of approach and Lyapunov stability the ory. However, the design proce-control coef fi cient was removed by incorporating Nussbaum gain ( Ge design, then a nonlinear adaptive robust autopilot was proposed for the ships in the presence of both parameter uncertainties and disturbances with unknown bound ( Du et al., 2007a ). This approach was further extended to an uncertain ship model with unknown time-variant parameters ( Du et al., 2007b ).
 tiation of the virtual control function, which results in the computation complexity of the actual control law. Fortunately, the dynamic surface control was proposed to solve the above problem by introducing fi rst-order fi ltering of the virtual control ( Swaroop et al., 2000 ; Yip and Hedrick, 1998 ; Song and Hedrick, 2011 ). The inherent  X  explosion of terms  X  problem in backstepping is eliminated by the incorporation of dynamic surface control in controller design. So far, this control method has been applied in formation control of multiple vehicles ( Girard and Hedrick 2003 ), magnetic levitation system ( Yang et al., 2004 ), and underactuated mechanical system ( Qaiser et al., 2007 ). Furthermore, an adaptive dynamic surface control algorithm was developed to deal with the integrated missile guidance and control model with unmatched uncertainties ( Hou and Duan, 2011 ).
 function into the backstepping, a novel adaptive nonlinear control scheme is developed to asymptotically regulate the course of ships with uncertain parameters and complete unknown control coef fi -cient and guarantee global uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the resulting closed-loop system. The advantages of this paper lie in that there is no requirement for a priori knowledge of problem is avoided, and the resulting controller is simpler to compute and easier to implement in engineering practice. formulation of our adaptive control problem of uncertain non-linear ship course system. The adaptive nonlinear control law is proposed for nonlinear ship course system with parameter uncer-tainties and completely unknown control coef fi cient in Section 3 .
Section 4 contains two simulation examples to show the effec-tiveness of the proposed adaptive nonlinear course controller of ships and Section 5 concludes this paper. 2. Problem formulation steering is suggested in the controller design.

T  X   X   X  _  X   X   X  _  X  3  X  K  X   X  1  X  where  X  is the actual course of ships and  X  is the ruder angle. The parameter K is the gain constant, T is the time constant, and  X  is the Norrbin coef fi cient which can be determined via a spiral test ( Fossen, 1994 ). The parameters of ship steering model vary signi fi cantly with operating conditions such as the water depth, the speed and load of ships. Therefore we assume that parameters T ; K and  X  are unknown constants in the design.

Then (1) can be transformed into the following state equations: _ x 1  X  x 2  X  2 : 1  X  _ lim
Commonly used Nussbaum functions include:  X  2 cos  X   X  X  ; 2 sin  X   X  X  ; and exp  X  2 cos  X  = 2  X  ( Ye and Jiang, 1998 ). The lemma regarding the property of Nussbaum gain is given as follows: Lemma 1. ( Ye and Jiang 1998 ): Let V U  X  X  and  X  U  X  X  be smooth smooth Nussbaum-type function, and  X  be a nonzero constant. If the following inequality holds : Vt  X  X  r where C represents some suitable constant, then  X  t  X  X  , Vt  X  X  , and R
Using Nussbaum function, we design control law and the parameter update law as follows: u  X  N  X   X  X  k 2 z 2  X   X  2 _  X   X  k 2 z 2  X   X  2 _ ^ unknown parameters  X  j j  X  1 ; 2  X  X  , and N  X   X  X  is an even Nussbaum type function. In this paper, N  X   X  X  X   X  2 cos  X  is exploited. Remark 2. Since the fi rst-order fi lter (6) has been introduced for the control law (11) can be directly derived from Eq. (6) , which allows us to avoid differentiating the virtual feedback control function  X  1 and prevent the explosion of the terms of the designed control law. Whereas ( Du et al., 2007a ) require to take the derivative of the virtual control function  X  1 , which results in the complex control law including the differentiation terms of the simpler to compute and easier to implement in engineering practice.

The following theorem shows the control performance of the presented closed-loop adaptive system of ship steering. Theorem 1.

In this section, two simulation examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the designed adaptive nonlinear course control law of ships.
 Example 1. The dynamic parameters of ship steering model (1) values are obtained from identi fi cation results of a frigate at a speed of U  X  12 m/s.
 In the simulation, let the desired course of ships be  X  d  X  20 1 . ^ 0 is 20 1 . We choose the control design parameters as k 1  X  0 : 06, k  X  30 and  X  1  X  2. Simulation results are shown in Fig. 1 . It can be seen from Fig. 1 (a) that the actual course  X  (dot line) of ships asymptotically reaches the desired heading  X  d (dash line) in 70 s and keeps at it, and the control rudder angle  X  (solid line) is ^ of parameters  X  1 and  X  2 , Nussbaum gain N  X   X  X  (dot line) and its argument  X  (solid line) are shown bounded as proved in Theorem 1 . Therefore, the proposed nonlinear adaptive course-keeping autopilot is effective for the ship motion system with uncertain parameters and completely unknown control coef fi cient and its control performance is satisfactory.
 Example 2. For a small ship with length of 45 m, the ship motion model of Eq. (1) has the following set of dynamic parameters at a forward speed of U  X  5 m/s: T  X  31 s, K  X  0 : 5s 1 , and  X   X  0 : 4s 2 ( Unar and Murray-Smith 1999 ).

In order to demonstrate the robustness of the designed adaptive nonlinear controller of ship course to the dynamic parameter changes of ship steering system, here we adopt the same initial conditions and controller design parameters as the counterparts of Example 1 in the simulation. The simulation results are depicted in in spite of the two sets of different model parameters of ship steering. Therefore, the robustness of the proposed adaptive con-troller to the parameter changes is very obvious. 5. Conclusion
In this paper, a novel adaptive nonlinear course control law of ships has been proposed in the presence of parameter uncertainties and completely unknown control coef fi cient through incorporating the dynamic surface control and Nussbaum gain in backstepping techni-que. It has been proven theoretically by means of Lyapunov function and the lemma regarding the property of Nussbaum gain that the developed adaptive nonlinear control strategy can achieve asymptotic regulating control of ship course and guarantee the global uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals of the resulting closed-loop. The proposed control scheme does not require a priori knowledge of the singularity problem due to the introduction of Nussbaum gain, and is simpler to compute and easier to implement due to the inclusion of a fi rst-order fi lter in the design. The effectiveness of the presented method was illustrated by the simulation results involving two ships.
