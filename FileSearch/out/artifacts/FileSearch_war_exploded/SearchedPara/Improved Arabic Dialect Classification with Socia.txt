 As more and more users share increasing amount of information on various social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), text analysis for so-cial media language is getting more important and challenging. When people share their sto-ries, opinions, post comments or tweets on so-cial media platforms, they frequently use collo-quial languages, which are more similar to spo-ken languages. In addition to typical natural lan-guage processing problems, the informal nature of social media languages presents additional chal-lenges, such as frequent spelling errors, improper casing, internet slang, spontaneity, dis-fluency and ungrammatical utterances (Eisenstein, 2014). Di-alect classification and dialect-specific processing are extra challenges for languages such as Arabic and Chinese.

Considering Arabic as an example: there are big differences between MSA and various dialec-tal Arabic: MSA is the standardized and literary variety of Arabic used in writing and in most for-ceedings, newspapers and product manuals. Many research and linguistic resources for Arabic nat-ural language processing are based on MSA. For example, most existing Arabic-English bilingual data are MSA-English parallel sentences. The di-alect Arabic has more varieties: 5 major dialects are spoken in different regions of the Arab world: Egyptian, Gulf, Iraqi, Levantine and Maghrebi (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011). These dialects differ in morphologies, grammatical cases, vocab-ularies and verb conjugations. These differences call for dialect-specific processing and modeling when building Arabic automatic speech recogni-tion (ASR) systems or machine translation (MT) systems. Therefore, identification and classifica-tion of Arabic text is fundamental for building so-cial media Arabic speech and language processing systems.
 In order to build better MT systems between Arabic and English, we first analyze the distri-bution of different Arabic dialects appearing on a very large scale social media platform, as well as their effect on Arabic-English machine translation. We propose several methods to improve the dialect classification accuracy by training models with distant supervision: a weakly supervised model is trained with data whose labels are automati-cally assigned based on authors X  geographical in-formation. A strongly supervised model is trained with manually annotated data. More importantly, semi-supervised learning on large amount of unla-beled data effectively increases the classification accuracy. We also combine different classifiers to achieve even bigger improvement. When eval-uated on two test sets, the widely adopted Ara-bic Online Commentary (AOC) corpus and a test set created from the social media domain (Face-book), our methods demonstrate an absolute 20% improvement over the weakly supervised classi-fier, and 5% over the strongly supervised classi-fier. Furthermore, the improved classifier is ap-plied on large amount of Arabic social media text to filter out non-MSA data. An LM trained with the cleaned data is used for English-Arabic (MSA) translation. Compared with the baseline model trained with the unfiltered data, the MSA LM re-duces the training data by 85%, model size by 70%, and it brings 0.6 BLEU point (Papineni et al., 2002) gain in MT.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we review previous research on this topic. In section 3 we analyze the dialect distri-bution and its impact on social media data transla-tion. We present the problem formulation in sec-tion 4. In section 5 we introduce two supervised classifiers trained with weakly and strongly la-beled data. We describe different semi-supervised learning methods in section 6, followed by the combination of multiple classifiers in section 7. In section 8 we show the experimental results on di-alect classification as well as machine translation. The paper finishes with discussions and conclu-sion in section 9. Previous research on Arabic dialect identification focused on two problems: spoken dialect classi-fication for speech recognition ((Novotney et al., 2011) and (Lei and Hansen, 2011)), and writ-ten text dialect classification mostly for machine translation. (Habash and Rambow, 2006), (Habash et al., 2008), (Diab et al., 2010) and (Elfardy and Diab, 2012) developed annotation guidelines and morphology analyzer for Arabic dialect. (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011) created the AOC data set by extracting reader commentary from online Arabic newspaper forums. The se-lected Arabic sentences are manually labeled with one of 4 dialect labels with the help of crowd sourcing: Egyptian , Gulf , Iraqi and Levantine . A dialect classifier using unigram features is trained from the labeled data. In the BOLT (Broad Oper-ational Language Translation) project, translation from dialectal Arabic (especially Egyptian Arabic) to English is a main problem. (Elfardy and Diab, 2013) uses the same labeled AOC data to generate token-based features and perplexity-based features for sentence level dialect identification between MSA and Egyptian Arabic. (Tillmann et al., 2014) trained feature-rich linear classifier based on lin-ear SVM then evaluated the classification between MSA and Egyptian Arabic, reporting 1.4% im-provement. All these experiments are based on the AOC corpus. The characteristics and distribution of the Arabic dialects could be different for online social media data. (Darwish et al., 2014) selected Twitter data and developed models taking consid-eration of lexical, morphological, and phonologi-cal information from different dialects, then classi-fied Egyptian and MSA Arabic tweets. (Cotterell and Callison-Burch, 2014) collected dialect data covering Iraqi and Maghrebi Arabic from Twitter as well.

When translating Arabic dialect into English, (Sawaf, 2010) and (Salloum and Habash, 2011) normalized dialect words into MSA equivalents considering character-and morpheme-level fea-tures, then translated the normalized input with MSA Arabic-English MT system. (Zbib et al., 2012) used crowd sourcing to build Levantine-English and Egyptian-English parallel data. Even with small amount of parallel corpora for each di-alect, they obtained significant gains (6-7 BLEU pts) over a baseline MSA-English MT system. The population speaking a dialect does not nec-essarily reflect its popularity on internet and so-cial media. Many factors, such as a country X  X  social-economic development status, internet ac-cess and government policy, play important roles. To understand the distribution of Arabic dialects on social media, we select data from the largest so-cial media platform, Facebook. There are around one billion users sharing content in 60+ languages every day. The Arabic content comes from dif-ferent regions of the Arabic world, representative enough for our analysis. We randomly select 2700 Figure 1: Distribution of various Arabic dialect on the social media platform sentences from public posts, then ask human an-is shown in Figure 1. Not surprisingly, MSA is the most widely used, accounting for 58% of sen-tences. Besides that, Egyptian Arabic is the most frequent dialect (34%), followed by Levantine and Gulf. Maghrebi is the least frequent. There are other sentences which are not labeled as Arabic dialect, such as classical Arabic, verses from the Quran, foreign words and their transliterations, etc.

We also investigate the effect of different di-alects on Arabic-English translation. We ask hu-mans to translate the Arabic sentences into En-glish to create reference translations. We build a phrase-based Arabic-English MT system with 1M sentence pairs selected from MSA Arabic-English parallel corpora (UN corpus, Arabic news corpus, similar to those described in (Koehn et al., 2007). More details about the MT system are given in section 8. We group the source Arabic sentences into different subsets based on their dialect labels, then translate them with the MT system. We mea-sure the BLEU score for each subset, as shown in Figure 2. As expected the MSA subset has the highest BLEU scores (18), followed by the Gulf dialect, which is somewhat similar to MSA. The translation of the Egyptian and Levantine dialects is more challenging, with BLEU scores around 10-12, even though they are 40% of the total Arabic data. To improve Arabic-English MT quality, in-creasing the bilingual data coverage for these two dialects should be most effective, as seen in (Zbib Figure 2: BLEU scores of different Arabic dialects in Arabic-English translation. The MT model is trained with mostly MSA-English parallel data. et al., 2012). Because the Maghrebi dialect sam-ple size is too small, we do not report its BLEU score. From these experiments, we further appre-ciate the importance of accurately identifying Ara-bic dialect and building dialect-specific translation models. In this section we present the general framework of dialect classification. Given a sentence S = { w 1 ,w 2 ,..,w l } generated by user u , its dialect class label d  X  is determined based on the following functions: where the probability function is defined accord-ing to the following exponential model: Here f k ( d i ,  X  ) is the k -th feature function. For ex-ample. f ( d i ,u ) models the likelihood of writing dialect d i by user u given the user X  X  profile infor-mation. f ( d i ,S ) models the likelihood of generat-ing sentence S with d i  X  X  n -gram language model: f ( d i ,S ) = log p ( S | d i )
This framework allows the incorporation of rich feature functions such as geographical, lexical, Figure 3: Arabic dialect map, from (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011). morphological and n-gram information, as seen in previous work ((Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011) , (Darwish et al., 2014), (Tillmann et al., 2014) and (Elfardy and Diab, 2013)). However, in this paper we focus on training classifiers with weakly and strongly labeled data, as well as semi-supervised learning methods. So we only choose the geo-graphical and text-based features. Exploration of other features will be reported in another paper.
Previous research (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2014) indicated that the unigram model obtains the best accuracy in dialect classification. How-ever, (Tillmann et al., 2014) and (Darwish et al., 2014) exploited more sophisticated text features that lead to better accuracy on selected test set. In our experiments, we find that the unigram model does outperform bigram and trigram models, so we stick to the unigram features. 5.1 Learning with Weakly Labeled Data In the chosen social media platform, each user is associated with a unique profile, which includes user-specific information such as the age and gen-der of the user, the country where s/he is from, etc.. As different Arabic dialects are spoken in differ-ent countries, one approach is to classify a post X  X  dialect type based on the author X  X  country, assum-ing that there is at least a major dialect spoken in each country. This approach is not highly accu-rate, because the user X  X  country information may be missing or inaccurate; one dialect may be spo-ken in multiple countries (for example, Egyptian is very popular in different regions of the Arabic world) and multiple dialects may be spoken in the same country; the user can post in MSA instead of dialect Arabic or a mixture of both. However, using data from certain countries as the  X  X pproxi-mate X  dialect training data, we can train a baseline classifier. As the training data labels are inferred from user profiles instead of manually annotated, such data is called weakly labeled data.

According to the dialect map shown in Fig.3, we group the social media posts into the following 5 dialects according to the author X  X  country: 1. Egyptian : Egypt 2. Gulf : Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirate, 3. Levantine : Syrian, Jordan, Palestinian, 4. Iraqi : Iraq 5. Maghrebi : Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco
Table 1 shows the number of words for each di-alect group. Considering the dialect distribution in the social media platform (shown in Figure 1), we focus on the classification of MSA (msa) and 3 Arabic dialects: Egyptian (egy), Gulf (gul) and Levantine (lev).

We train an n-gram model for each dialect from the collected data. To train the MSA model, we select sentences from Arabic UN corpus and news collections. All the dialect and MSA models share the same vocabulary, thus perplexity can be com-pared properly. At classification time, given an in-put sentence, the classifier computes the perplex-ity for each dialect type and choose the one with minimum perplexity as the label.

Dialect Weakly Labeled Strongly Labeled Table 1: Corpus size (word count) of weakly and strongly labeled data for supervised learning. The weakly labeled dialect data is from Facebook based on users X  country information. The strongly labeled data is manually annotated from the AOC corpus. 5.2 Learning with Strongly Labeled Data In the AOC corpus, every sentence X  X  dialect type is labeled by human annotators. As these labels are gold labels, the AOC corpus is strongly labeled data. Because of the high cost of manual annota-tion, the strongly labeled data is much less than the weakly labeled data, but the higher quality makes it possible to train a better classifier. Table 1 shows the corpus size. Although over 50% data is MSA. Egyptian, Gulf and Levantine dialects still have significant presence while the Iraqi dialect has the least labeled data. Such distribution is consistent with what we observed from the social media data. Using these strongly labeled data, we can train a classifier that significant outperforms the weakly supervised classifier. 6.1 Self-training Given the small amount of gold labeled data from the AOC corpus and large amount of unlabeled data from the social media platform, a natural combination is semi-supervised learning. In other words, by applying the strongly supervised clas-sifier on the unlabeled data, we can obtain  X  X uto-matically labeled X  dialect data that could further improve the classification accuracy. From the so-cial media platform we select additional Arabic posts with a total of 646M words. The sizes of the newly created dialect corpora are shown in Ta-ble 2. Notice that the MSA data accounts for more than 75% of all the labeled data. We train a new classifier with these additional data. As the new labels are only from the original strong classifier, this is self-training. 6.2 Co-Training Another approach for automatic labeling is co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998). With two classifier C 1 and C 2 classifying the same input sentence S with labels l 1 and l 2 , S is labeled as l only if l 1 = l 2 = l . In other words, a sentence is labeled and used to train a model only when the two classifiers agree. In our experiment we use both the weakly and strongly supervised classifiers to classify the same unlabeled data. Table 2 lists the sizes of the dialect corpora from co-training. Compared with the self-training approach, the co-training method filters out 25% data. 6.3 Data Filtering Because of domain mismatch, even the strongly supervised classifier does not achieve very high accuracy on the social media test set, thus there is
Dialect Self-training Co-training Filter Table 2: The size of dialect corpora from semi-supervised learning. lots of noise in the automatically labeled data. To filter this noise, we only keep the sentences whose minimum perplexity score (corresponding to the winning dialect label) is smaller than any other perplexity score by a margin. Lower perplexity means higher probability of generating the sen-tence from the dialect model. In other words, sen-tence S is assigned with label l and used in model re-training if and only if perp l ( S ) &lt; perp k ( S )  X  threshold , for k 6 = l . The threshold is selected to optimize the classification accuracy on a tuning set. Table 2 also shows the corpora size after fil-tering. We can see that the filtered dialect is only a quarter of the self-training data. We will com-pare the three semi-supervised learning methods and evaluate the gains to dialect classification. Now we have 3 types of classifiers: 1. The weakly supervised classifier trained with 2. The strongly supervised classifier trained 3. The semi-supervised classifier trained with How should we combine them to further improve the classification accuracy?
One approach is data combination: simply adding all the training data together to train a uni-fied n-gram model for each dialect. This exper-iment is straightforward but the performance is suboptimal because the classifier will be domi-nated by the model with the most training data, even though its accuracy may not be the best.
The second approach is model combination: we compute the model scores of the weakly su-pervised ( w ), strongly supervised ( s ) and semi-supervised ( e ) classifiers, then combines them with linear interpolation: As the dialect n-gram perplexity is computed sep-arately, the model weights w m can be tuned. In our experiments we optimize them with a tuning set from all the dialects. 8.1 Dialect Classification We already described the training data for super-vised and semi-supervised classifiers in previous sections. In this section we will compare their di-alect classification accuracies. We select two test sets: 9.5K sentences from the AOC corpus as the AOC test set and 2.3K sentences from the Face-have the dialect of each sentence labeled by hu-man. The accuracy is computed as the percentage of sentences whose classified label is the same as the human label. 90% of the AOC labeled data are used for training the strongly supervised clas-sifier, and the remaining 10% data containing 9.5K sentences is for evaluation. We also keep 200 sen-tences from the AOC corpus as the development set to tune the model combination parameters. Table 3: Arabic dialect classification accuracies with the weakly and strongly supervised classi-fiers, as well as the semi-supervised model.
In Table 3 we show the overall classification ac-curacies of different models on both test sets. No-tice that the weakly supervised classifier trained with 68M words obtains 68% accuracy on the AOC test set and 48% on the FB test set (row 1), which is not much higher. However, considering this classifier is trained without any human labeled dialect data, the performance is expected and can be improved with better training data and models. The strongly supervised classifier (row 2), which is trained with much less human labeled data (only 2.6M words), outperforms the weak classifier by 15%. Such a difference is consistently observed in both test tests. This confirms the significant bene-fits from the gold labeled data.

We apply the strong classifier to large amount of unlabeled data, and train several semi-supervised classifiers with these automatically labeled data. The best result is obtained with the co-training strategy, which brings significant improvement over the strongly supervised model: 2.8-4.6% (row 3), as the label noise is effectively reduced among the agreed labels from two supervised clas-sifiers. Finally, combining all three classifiers (row 1, 2 and 3) with model combination achieves the best result: about 5% improvement of the strong baseline and 20% over the weak baseline. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combin-ing labeled and unlabeled data obtained from so-cial media platform.
 strongly supervised baseline 83.4% 63.1% Table 4: Comparison of semi-supervised learning and combination methods.

With semi-supervised learning, we evaluate three data selection methods: self-training, co-training and data filtering. The results are shown in Table 4. Compared with the strong classifier baseline, the self-training method improves by 1% -2.4%, the co-training method improves by 2.8-4.6%, and the data filtering method improves by 1.7-1.8%. The co-training method is the most ef-fective for both test sets because the information are from two independent classifiers. Data filter-ing is more effective for the AOC test set (which has the same domain as the baseline model) but less so for the FB test set because valuable in-domain data are filtered out.

In the same table we also compare the results from model and data combination: one from the semi-supervised co-training and the other from the strongly supervised learning. On the AOC test set, the data concatenation method is significantly each dialect. worse than the model interpolation method. Its ac-curacy is even lower than that of the supervised classifier (82.1% vs. 83.4%). However the gap is much smaller on the FB test set. The automati-cally labeled data is much more than the human labeled data, thus it dominates the combined train-ing data set, which is not a good match for the AOC test data, but is more relevant to the FB test data. In both cases, the model combination obtains better classification accuracies, where the super-vised model is assigned higher weights (0.9) and the semi-supervised model is used for smoothing, therefore the combined model is able to improve over the strong classifier.

We further analyze the classification precision for each type of dialect on both test sets in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows the result on the AOC test set. The number after the dialect type (in the parenthe-sis) is the number of sentences from that dialect. Precisions increase from the weakly supervised to the strongly supervised to the semi-supervised classifier, and the combined classifier generally outperforms all three classifiers, except for the Gulf dialect. However, considering the smaller percentage of the Gulf dialect, we still observe significant improvement overall. Figure 4b shows the result on the FB test set, where the MSA and Egyptian dialects are much more frequent than the Levantine and Gulf dialects. Improving classifica-tion on the MSA and Egyptian dialect (especially MSA) will be very helpful. We notice that the su-pervised classifier improves over the unsupervised classifier by a large margin on the MSA and Gulf dialects, but performs worse on the Egyptian and Levantine dialects. This is different from the result in the AOC test set, where the supervised classifier consistently improves over the unsupervised clas-sifier. One reason is that in the AOC test set, the training and test data are from the same corpus, thus the supervised training from in-domain data is very effective. For the FB test set, the strongly labeled data and the test data mismatch in genre and topics. The automatically labeled data is less similar to the dialect test set, thus it is less effective for the Egyptian and Levantine dialects. This fur-ther confirms the necessity of combining informa-tion from multiple sources. The combined classi-fier performs significantly better for the MSA and Gulf dialect, but slightly worse for the Egyptian and Levantine dialects. The overall result is still positive.

We also compare our approach with other di-alect classification methods on the AOC corpus, which is commonly used so the results are com-parable. Most previous work focus on the clas-sification of MSA vs. EGY dialect, and report the accuracies from 85.3% (Elfardy and Diab, 2013), 87.9% (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2014) to 89.1% (Tillmann et al., 2014), adding morpho-logical features, using word-based unigram-model and linear SVM models. Our MSA vs. EGY dialect classification accuracy is 92.0%, the best known result on this test set. We do not use more sophisticated features; the improvement is just from the mined unlabeled data and the com-bination of different classifiers. On the FB test set, our strongly supervised classifier is the same as (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2014), both using word-based unigram model. We see 5% gain with the combined classifiers. 8.2 Machine Translation The motivation of this research is to handle chal-lenges from Arabic dialects to improve machine translation quality. For example, using the dialect classifier output one can build dialect-specific Arabic-English MT systems. Given an Arabic sen-tence, the system first identifies its dialect type, then translates with the corresponding MT system. When building English-to-Arabic (MSA) transla-tion systems for social media translation, the target LM trained from in-domain data is very helpful to improve the translation quality. Considering that the Arabic in-domain data contains lots of dialects, an effective dialect classifier helps filter out dialect Arabic and only keep the MSA to train a cleaner LM.

Because of the limited bilingual resources of di-alect Arabic-English, we will focus on English-Arabic MT system first. In this experiment, the training data for the English-Arabic MT system is 1M parallel sentences selected from publicly available Arabic-English bilingual data (LDC, OPUS). Because none of the parallel corpora is for social media translation, we select a subset closer to the social media domain by maximizing the n-gram coverage on the test domain. The de-velopment and test sets contain 700 and 892 En-glish sentences, respectively. These sentences are translated into MSA by human translators. We ap-ply the standard SMT system building procedures: pre-processing, automatic word alignment, phrase extraction, parameter tuning with MERT, and de-coding with a typical phrase-based decoder simi-lar to (Koehn et al., 2007). The LM is trained with the target side of the parallel data, plus 200M in-domain Arabic sentences.

Using the above combined dialect classifier, we label the dialect type of each sentence in the in-domain data, filter out any non-MSA sentences and re-train the target LM. Again to keep the in-domain data clean, we also apply the threshold-based data filtering. As shown in Table 5, the dialect filtering reduces the LM training data by 85%, which corresponds to 70% less memory footprint. Thanks to the cleaner LM, the transla-Table 5: Cleaned MSA LM after dialect filtering for English-Arabic(MSA) translation. Existing Arabic dialect classification methods solely rely on textural features, be they n-gram language model or morphology/POS-based fea-tures. This paper utilizes authors X  geographical information to train a weakly supervised dialect classifier. Using the weakly and strongly super-vised classifiers to classify and filter unlabeled data leads to several improved semi-supervised classifiers. The combination of all three signif-icantly improves the Arabic dialect classification accuracy on both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets: 20% absolute improvement over the weak baseline and 5% absolute over the strong baseline. After applying the proposed classifier to filter out Arabic dialect data, and building a cleaned MSA LM, we observe 70% model size reduction with 0.6 BLEU point gain in English-Arabic translation quality.

In future work, we would like to explore more user-specific information for dialect classification, apply the classifier for Arabic-to-English MT sys-tems, and extend the approach to a larger family of languages and dialects.
