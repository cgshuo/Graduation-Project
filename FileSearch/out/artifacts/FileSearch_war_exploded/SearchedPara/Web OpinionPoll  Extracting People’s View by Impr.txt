The World Wide Web is now a treasure house of public opinion about any and all topics. We have therefore been developing a novel Web-based question answering system, named  X  X eb OpinionPoll X , that collects other people X  X  opin-ions about a user-given concern on the Web, and presents a general view, local aspect, and short summary of the opin-ions in a visual way. This system will be able to intuitively answer users X  questions requesting others X  opinions, for ex-ample,  X  X hat do people think about mothers always getting angry? X . We report on the progress of our developing sys-tem, and propose a system that effectively collects the Web pages that are related to a user question or concern using a paraphrasing technique, extracts impressions from each of the Web pages, and plots their impressions on two impres-sion planes each spanned by two impression scales.
The impressions of target text are represented by an im-pression vector containing scale values in four impression scales; IS1 ) Anticipation / Surprise, IS2 ) Acceptance / Dis-gust, IS3 ) Joy / Sadness, and IS4 ) Fear / Anger 1 . Each scale value is a real number between 0 and 1, and is calcu-lated by consulting our impression dictionary and obtaining the scale values and weights in the corresponding impression scale of the content words extracted from target text. An impression dictionary was created by analyzing the Nikkei Newspaper Full Text Database [2] from the 1990 to 2001 edition, where each edition contains about 170,000 ar-ticles (200 MB). The scale value in an impression scale of a word indicates which of two sets of impression words com-posing the impression scale the word co-occurs more often with, and is calculated using an extended version of the method proposed in Ref. [3]. One impression scale was com-
These scales were designed based on the eight basic ele-ments of human feelings which R. Plutchik proposed [1]. Figure 1: Procedures to answer user questions re-questing others X  opinions. posed by two contrasting impression words in Ref. [3], but was composed by two contrasting sets each containing one or more impression words in this extended version.
An impression vector is generated from input text as fol-lows. Content words are extracted from input text [4], and the scale value S and weight M in impression scale IS of each word are obtained by consulting the impression dictio-nary. The scale value O IS of the input text is then calculated using the following expression.
 This calculation is done for every impression scale, and con-sequently an impression vector  X ( O IS 1 , O IS 2 , O IS 3 is generated.
Figure 1 illustrates how the present  X  X eb OpinionPoll X  system works for a user question such as  X  X hat do people think about  X  X  X  ? X  form.

First, our proposed system extracts a character string fol-lowing the word  X  X bout X  from user questions, and retrieves using Google [5] on the Web entering the character string as a query. If the number of hits for this query is less than N , proceed to the query expansion stage based on paraphrasing, where N denotes the lowest number of inquired pages, and is specified by users. Next, the query or character string is de-composed into words 2 , and nouns, verbs, and adjectives are
Postprocessing is done for the words. For instance,

Queries for ob-taining candidate words for paraphrasing are then generated by removing each of the target words from the initial query. The system retrieves information from the Web by entering the queries. Of the retrieval results, the words that are ob-served in the same position with the target words removed are treated as candidate words for their paraphrasing.
Validity in paraphrasing of the candidate words obtained is tested using co-occurrence and impression dictionaries. First, the cosine distance between a target word and each of the corresponding candidate words is computed by consult-ing our co-occurrence dictionary 3 and obtaining their co-occurrence information. If it is less than 0 . 13, the candidate word is discarded. Next, the Euclidean distance between im-pression vectors generated from target and candidate words is computed. If it is larger than 0 . 36, the candidate word is discarded. Here, examples of this two-step filtering are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

The query expansion stage proceeds from the first step to the fourth step, but it is terminated and goes to the final stage as soon as the number of hits is equal to or larger than N . In the first step, zero or more target words in the initial query are paraphrased into the candidate words which were valid for the target words, so that new queries are generated. In the secod step, adnominal modifiers existing in each query are separated from the other part. In the third step, the character strings in each query are decomposed into phrases (bunsetsu). In the fourth or final step, conjunctive particles  X  X anoshiku-nai (be not happy) X  consisting of  X  X anoshii (be happy) X  and  X  X ai (not) X  is handled as one word. This post-processing is also performed in constructing impression dic-tionaries and in generating impression vectors.
A co-occurrence dictionary was automatically constructed by analyzing the Nikkei Newspaper Full Text Database from the 1990 to 2001 edition, as well as the impression dictio-nary. The noun, verb or adjective that was followed by and followed each of the noun, verb, or adjective in the database was registered with its frequency data.

 are removed from each query.

Finally, impression vectors are generated from the Web pages finally obtained and are plotted on impression planes. The scale values of an impression vector are calculated from the title and three-line summary obtained as retrieval results to save the time required. An example of plotting on the impression planes is shown in Fig. 2.
We evaluate performance of our paraphrasing method, and verify its effectiveness. Query expansion was applied to seven of the ten example sentences we prepared and used when N was set to 1000, and consequently, 96 candidate words were obtained. For each of the 96 candidate words, we estimated the validity of their paraphrasing on the four-step scale;  X  X lways valid, X   X  X alid in most cases, X   X  X alid in its context, X  and  X  X ot valid X . The results are shown in Table 3.

Only three of the 55 candidate words which were rejected by the validity test using the co-occurrence dictionary were estimated with  X  X alid in its context X ;  X  X iarasou (quarrel) X  for  X  X koru (get angry) X ,  X  X youiku (education) X  for  X  X kuji (child-nurturing) X  and  X  X enka (fight) X  for  X  X koru (get an-gry) X . Although 15 of the 41 candidate words that were ac-cepted by the validity test were estimated with  X  X ot valid X , nine of the 15 candidate words were removed by the valid-ity test using the impression dictionary. This demonstrated that the two-step filtering was effective in obtaining candi-date words for paraphrasing.
