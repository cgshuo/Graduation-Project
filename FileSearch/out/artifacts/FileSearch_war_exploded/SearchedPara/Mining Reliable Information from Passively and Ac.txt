 Recent years have witnessed an astonishing growth of crowd-contributed data, which has become a powerful information source that covers almost every aspect of our lives. This big treasure trove of information has fundamentally changed the ways in which we learn about our world. Crowdsourcing has attracted considerable attentions with various approaches developed to utilize these enormous crowdsourced data from different perspectives. From the data collection perspective, crowdsourced data can be divided into two types:  X  X assively X  crowdsourced data and  X  X ctively X  crowdsourced data; from task perspective, crowdsourcing research includes informa-tion aggregation, budget allocation, worker incentive mech-anism, etc. To answer the need of a systematic introduction of the field and comparison of the techniques, we will present an organized picture on crowdsourcing methods in this tuto-rial. The covered topics will be interested for both advanced researchers and beginners in this field.
The crowd-contributed data have become a powerful in-formation source that covers almost every aspect of our lives, including traffic conditions, environmental conditions, health, public events, and many others. Traditionally, such information is provided only by specialized sources such as authoritative agencies, professional media, and expensive sensing devices, which might not update frequently or pro-vide complete coverage. With the proliferation of mobile devices and social media platforms, now any person can publicize his observations about any activities, events or ob-jects anywhere and at any time. The confluence of these enormous crowdsourced data can contribute to an inexpen-sive, sustainable and large-scale decision system that has never been possible before. To build such a system, many research studies have been deployed from various perspec-tives of crowdsourcing, such as aggregation, budget alloca-tion, and task allocation. In this tutorial, we will give a full picture of the state-of-the-art crowdsourcing researches. We will focus on two types of crowdsourcing, referred to as  X  X assive X  crowdsourcing and  X  X ctive X  crowdsourcing. In passive crowdsourcing, users are sharing what they observe and experience, typically via social media platforms, dis-cussion forums and smartphone apps. These platforms are usually serving general-purpose information sharing, but we can extract relevant information regarding a specific task (e.g., traffic, environment, or drug effect monitoring) from such platforms. On the other hand, actively crowdsourced data usually come from the platforms and apps that are de-signed to actively solicit users X  reports and answers for spe-cific tasks, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk 1 (mTurk) and CrowdFlower 2 . In this tutorial, we will introduce and com-pare approaches to handle both types of crowdsourced data for the tasks including data aggregation, budget allocation, etc.
This tutorial is intended for researchers and practitioners in data mining. While the audience with a good background on data mining and algorithms would benefit most from this tutorial, we believe the material to be presented would give general audience and newcomers a complete picture of the current work, introduce important research topics in this field, and inspire them to learn more.

Wei Fan is currently the senior director and deputy head of Baidu Big Data Lab in Sunnyvale, California. He received his PhD in Computer Science from Columbia University in 2001. His main research interests and experiences are in various areas of data mining and database systems, such as, deep learning, stream computing, high performance comput-ing, bioinformatics, social network analysis, novel applica-tions and commercial data mining systems. His co-authored paper received ICDM06/KDD11/KDD12/KDD13/KDD97 Best Paper &amp; Best Paper Runner-up Awards. He led the team that used his Random Decision Tree (www.dice.com) method to win 2008 ICDM Data Mining Cup Championship. He received 2010 IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Award for his contribution to IBM Infosphere Streams. He is the associate editor of ACM Transaction on Knowledge Dis-covery and Data Mining (TKDD). During his times as the Associate Director in Huawei Noah X a  X  A  X  Zs Ark Lab in Hong Kong from Aug. 2012 to Dec. 2014, he has led his col-leagues to develop Huawei StreamSMART a streaming plat-form for online and real-time processing, query and mining of very fast streaming data. StreamSMART is 3 to 5 times faster than STORM and 10 times faster than SparkStream-ing, and was used in Beijing Telecom, Saudi Arabia STC, Norway Telenor and a few other mobile carriers in Asia. Since joining Baidu Big Data Lab, Wei has been working on medical and healthcare research and applications, such as deep learning-based disease diagnosis based on NLP input as well as medical dialogue robot.
