 Trending search suggestion is leading a new paradigm of image search, where user X  X  exploratory search experience is facilitated with the automatic suggestion o f trending queries. Existing im-age search engines, however, only provide general suggestions and hence cannot capture user X  X  pers onal interest. In this paper, we move one step forward to investigate personalized suggestion of trending image searches according to users X  search behaviors. To this end, we propose a learning-based framework including two novel components. The first component, i.e., trending-aware weight-regularized matrix factorization (TA-WRMF), is able to suggest personalized trending search queries by learning user preference from many users as well as auxiliary common searches. The sec-ond component associates the most r epresentative and trending im-age with each suggested query. The personalized suggestion of image search consists of a trending textual query and its associat-ed trending image. The combined textual-visual queries not only are trending (bursty) and personalized to user X  X  search preference, but also provide the compelling visual aspect of these queries. We evaluate our proposed learning-based framework on a large-scale search logs with 21 million users and 41 million queries in two weeks from a commercial image search engine. The evaluation-s demonstrate that our system achieve about 50% gain compared with state-of-the-art in terms of query prediction accuracy.

 Image search, query suggestion, personalization, matrix factoriza-tion, trending search detection.
Today X  X  Web interfaces for information seeking have predom-inantly focused on facilitating the  X  X earch X  behavior when users are exploring the Web. Recent studies have found that the typical information retrieval activity by typing short queries into search boxes are not enough to satisfy users X  search intent. This is par-ticularly true for image search, where a significant part of queries is from recommendation (e.g., inspi red from browsing a webpage, triggered by a popular social event, etc.). A new search paradigm X  exploratory search X  X hich facilitates user X  X  searching experience with browsing (i.e., recommendation) to foster seeking and inves-tigation, is therefore emerging.

This paper is concerned about providing image search engine users with trending queries (via a c ombined textual-visual form), which are highly related to users X  personal interest, to further en-hance their exploratory search experience (as shown in Fig. 1). Knowing the trends that most users are searching for, not only can increase user engagement by pro-actively suggesting trending news [1], but also serve for the detection of socially trending events, e.g., detecting influenza epidemics in a short latency [11].

The query log data in a search engine provide rich information of what users are interested [4, 24]. When large amount of users search for similar information, there emerges a trend, ranging from worldwide breaking news to celebrity gossips. Many search en-gines have already provided related services. For example, Bing Popular Now detects general trending searches 1 . To tailor the trending topics for personalization purpose, Yahoo! Trending Now and Google Trends 3 suggest the trending searches based on user locality information. Google also p rovides search trends analytic in a set of pre-defined categories 4 . Besides, Bing serves with trending image searches 5 , which can dig out different kinds of trends from image search log. Please see Figure 1(A) for an example. Howev-er, the suggested queries from most existing online services are not tailored to user preferences.

There has been extensive research on trending search. Dong et al. investigate the detection of trending searches [10]. Bawab et al. introduce the locality-aware trending search detection in Ya-hoo! [1]. Instead of using simple search statistics, Golbandi et al. propose a linear auto-regression model to shorten the latency of trending detection [12]. Meanwhile, the trending queries can be also mined from social networks [7, 28].

It can be observed that there are two unsolved issues in exist-ing applications. First, the suggested trending queries from exist-ing search engines are not personalized or only related to locality while ignoring individuals X  search preferences [1]. However, when browsing trending queries, users are always preferring the results tailored to their personal inter ests. As shown in Fig. 1, user #1125 is interested in  X  X olden Globes X  and  X  X aseball X  related topics ac-cording to his/her search behaviors. It is therefore more reasonable to suggest related trending search es to this user. Second, besides personalized suggestion of textual queries, the selection of repre-sentative image for each trending search is able to facilitate user X  X  understanding of the bursty events. However, this is often over-looked in existing works. Though some search engines, such as Google and Bing, have provided trending image search, the selec-tion of representative images highly depends on editorial effort and does not consider visual aspect.

Motivated by the above observations, we propose a novel learning-based framework for personalized suggestion of trending image search by mining image search log data. The suggested textual-visual queries, each represented by the combined form of a textual query and its associated representative image, are not only socially trending due to their burst nature, but also personalized to users X  search behaviors. The proposed framework consists of two compo-nents. The first component includes a novel trending-aware weight-regularized matrix factorization (TA-WRMF) algorithm which sug-gests the personalized trending te xtual queries by formulating the process as one-class collaborative filter problem. The second com-ponent selects the most representative and trending image for each textual search. Specifically, we investigate how to extract discrimi-native features from image search log, including popularity, visual consistency, as well as trending f actor. The suggested textual-visual trending image search queries can improve user engagement and therefore foster user X  X  exploratory search experience.

In summary, we make the following contributions:
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 presents the framework. Section 4 and 5 analyze the dataset and expe riments, respectively, followed by the conclusions in Section 6.
The research related to trending image search suggestion includes trending search detection, query s uggestion/auto-completion, and representative image selection.

Trending search detection. Most previous research on trending search detection depends on the statistics of search queries. Dong et al. detect the trending searches by the likelihood differences of query search in different time windows [10]. Bawab et al. extend the idea and further introduce the locality-aware likelihood to de-rive local trending searches [1]. Chen et al. propose classification-based method to distinguish stable , one time burst , multiple time burst ,and periodic queries [9]. Golbandi et al. propose a linear auto-regression model to shorten the latency of trending search de-tection [12]. In addition to the search trends, other research works detect the trends from blogosphere [19], online news [8], and so-cial media, such as Twitter [7] and Youtube [28]. To the best of our knowledge, there is few attempt f or personalizing trending search suggestion with representative images.

Query suggestion and auto-completion. Query suggestion and query auto-completion are two closely related research topics. Query suggestion returns a list of ranked queries with respect to a given query, while query auto-completion returns queries with the first few letters in common with user X  X  input. In general, there are t-wo categories of methods. The first branch is session-based meth-ods, where the basic idea is that the queries co-occurring in the same sessions are the candidates for suggestion [2, 14]. The second branch is based on document-clic k relationship [6, 23]. The query-document bipartite graph is built from search log. Two queries are assumed similar if the correspondi ng clicked URLs are identical [20].

However, previous research only focuses on the condition with input query and does not learn any latent topics or consider per-sonalization. Ma et al. attempt to jointly learn the latent topics of users, queries, and URLs via collaborative filtering (CF) and define the query similarity on the learned latent space [22]. However, their approach needs the For personalization, Shokouhi et al. propose to build personal profile considering long-term search history, short-term history (previous searches in the same session), age, gender, selection. and region [31]. However, their approach only leverages personal search history which provides limited knowledge for understanding users.

Representative image selection. The criteria of representative image selection can be summarized as: (1) visual consistency X  the selected image should be visually similar to many others [16, 33, 35]; (2) visual orthogonality X  X wo similar images should not be included [32]; and (3) relevance X  X ow relevant the image is to this query, which can be measured by popularity (i.e., the number of queries for this image) [16] or textual-visual similarity [33]. In addition, Kennedy et al. adopt a time information as criteria [16].
In summary, we move one step forward in this paper for per-sonalized trending image search suggestion. Different from query suggestion/auto-completion, we do not need any query as input. For representative image selection, we extract features from image search log rather than image collection and further investigate the trending-aware time feature.
In this section, we introduce the proposed framework of learning to personalize trending search sugge stion. The framework is shown in Figure 2. After preprocessing, trending image search queries are detected based on the statistics of queries from the image search log, as shown in Figure 2(A) (Section 3.1). Then we learn the user interests ( U =[ u 1  X  X  X  u i  X  X  X  u | U | ] ) and trending search attributes ( Q =[ q 1  X  X  X  q j  X  X  X  q | Q | ] ) simultaneously via matrix factorization (MF) on the click-through matrix ( R ), as shown in Figure 2(B). To leverage the information from common searches without sacri-ficing the accuracy of trending searches, we propose the trending-aware weighted regularized matrix factorization (TA-WRMF). The personalized suggestion (i.e., re -ranked list of trending searches) depends on the inner product of the l earned user interests and trend-ing query attributes (Section 3.2). Moreover, to better visualize the search trends, we select the most representative trending image for each suggested textual query, as shown in Figure 2(C). In addi-tion to relevance and visual consistency , we propose burstiness as the criteria for trending-aware image selection (Section 3.3). The suggested personalized trending que ry is in the textual-visual for-m with both the textual query and its representative image. In the following sections, we will ela borate each component in details.
We start with trending search detection. To find buzzing search queries, we adopt similar strategy to [1]. First, only top frequent search queries (i.e., 10 , 000 in this work) are kept and only their buzz score will be computed. The buzz score BS ( q j ) of the query q is defined by where P ( q j | Q d ) is the likelihood of query q j given the query set Q d of day d . Instead of choosing max difference [1], i.e., we adopt weighted sum to aggregate all the differences information within several days. The reason is that we prefer to detect the search with popularity rising dramatically at current moment. However, the max difference cannot distinguish this issue.

Next, we have to single out a representative search on behalf of a group of queries with similar s emantics. Thus, the concept of generalized count is adopted and shown to be robust and efficient in [1]. That is, the query q i gives a generalized count for q q is a substring of q j , e.g.,  X  X resident Barack Obama X  provides a generalized count for  X  X arack Obama. X  The buzz score of the search query q j is then modified as in [1]: where v ( q j ,d ) is the count of q j during day d and v generalized count of q j during day d . With the help of generalized count,  X  X arack Obama X  would be preferred, as  X  X resident Barack Obama X  and  X  X arack Obama X  have similar BS . In practice, the search queries with the top BS can be sent to the editorial staffs to manually check the trending search quality [1].
To personalize search query suggestion for each user, it is rea-sonable to learn personal interest from user X  X  search log. However, the search log data of individual users are usually sparse and thus might provide very limited persona l knowledge. Leveraging users with similar search queries to expa nd personal interest is a feasible solution. Moreover, with the click-through data, we can assume that users are implicitly interested in the issued search queries. The non-clicked search queries might be uninterested or unknown. This scenario is similar to the one-class collaborative filtering (OCCF) problem, where only the positive data are provided and could be solved by matrix factorization techniques (MF) [25]. Here the ma-jor concern is whether the sparsity issue exists, which is a common problem to deal with search log data [3], and whether it will affect the performance. In this work, as the suggestion targets are trending searches, i.e., the searches would be issued by many users during a short period of time, there is no sparsity issue. Therefore, we can apply MF technique to solve the OCCF problem in this work. As a result, inspired from [25], which is well-known for OC-CF problem, we apply the weight-regularized matrix factorization (WRMF) as our model 6 , which is formulated as follows: J ( U , Q t )= where R is the click-through matrix, R ij =1 indicates user u has issued query q j in the training set, and ( u i , q j itive pair. R ij =0 indicates user u i has never issued query q [ u 1  X  X  X  u i  X  X  X  u | U | ] is the user matrix where u i is the latent interest of user u i . u i is a z -dimensional vector, where z is the number of trix where q t j is the latent attributes of trending search q z -dimensional vector. Q t is the trending search set. Please note that we use superscript t to denote the detected trending image queries to differentiate from general queries. Q t assigns the queries to the latent interests. W is the weight matrix which control the impor-tance of positive pairs and is defined by where W n ij should be smaller than 1 because positive ( u are more significant in the OCCF problem to avoid the imbalance issue. However, if only trending searches are used for user under-standing, it is possible to suffer short information. The number of trending searches, i.e., | Q t | , is extremely small compare to the number of user | U | . Therefore, the low-ra nk approximation might barely mine useful knowledge from it. The first term of the ob-jective function J ( U , Q t ) in Equation (4) targets on modeling the two latent spaces of user and query, respectively. The similarity between two spaces are defined by inner product. The second term is to reduce the length of user and query factors, which decreases the model complexity to prevent data overfitting.

Another issue is how to use the information from both the trend-ing and common searches (i.e., queries) as much as possible to learn the latent relationship between users and trending search-es. q t i , Q t ,and Q t can be replaced by q i , Q ,and Q ly. Q t = Q t  X  Q c ,where Q c is the common search set, and q ( q c j  X  Q c ) represents a common search query. Unfortunately, this setting neglects the importance of trending searches, which is the real suggestion target. Treating each common search equally to each trending searches might sacrifice the accuracy of trending searches due to the imbalance issue ( | Q c || Q t | ).

TA -W R M F . Motivated from the above observations, aiming at leveraging the information from common searches without sacrific-ing the accuracy of trending searches, we propose a novel trending-aware weighted regularized matrix factorization (TA-WRMF). The idea is similar to solve the OCCF problem, except that we ap-ply the weighted regularization twice X  X nce for the imbalance of positive/negative pairs and the other for the imbalance of trend-ing/common searches. Then, we define the weighted matrix ( W ) as: where W P &gt; 1 is to increase the importance of positive ( u pairs, and W N &lt; 1 is to control the importance of negative ( u pairs. W n i,j is only applied on negative ( u i , q c j ) pairs. With such a design, the pairs containing q t j are more important/positive pairs. The imbalance issues are then resolved. As a result, we can not only leverage the information of common searches but also ensure the accuracy of trending searches.

Scalability and Sampling . However, one of the drawbacks of using all the queries is the scalability issue. The complexity would be
O ( | U | X | Q | X  z  X  T ) where T is the number of optimiza-tion iterations. The time consump tion would be intolerable due to enormous number of queries in real world. To reducing the com-plexity with competitive performance, we adopt user-oriented sam-pling strategy to approximate W n i,j . The number of negative sam-pled pairs N ns i is proportional to the number of positive pairs N ( N i = j R ij )ofauser u i . m = N sample over positive pairs. Then, we have where N n i ( N n i = | Q | X  j R ij ) is the number of negative pairs of u . Then, the complexity becomes O N p (1+ m + | Q t | )  X  z O ( | U | X  z  X  T ) ,where N p is the total number of positive ( u pairs in the training data 7 . To solve Eqn. (4), stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is further applied for better efficiency [17], and the iteration formulations are where  X  is the learning rate and  X  is the regularization term training phase, we separate part of ( u i , q j ) pairs from training data to form a validation set. When the cost function J ( U , Q not decrease for c ( c =20 ) continuous iterations on validation set, convergence is claimed. The overall optimization process is summarized in the Algorithm 1. In short, our proposed TA-WRMF adopts weighted regularization t wice to solve the two imbalance issues and learns better latent structures of users and search queries.
The selected trending images are expected to facilitate the under-standing of trending searches. Different from previous works min-ing from social image collections, we target at digging information from the commercial image search log. In this section, we inves-tigate the widely adopted represen tative image selection features, i.e., relevance and visual consistency [16], as well as the features related to search popularity, i.e., burstiness . Algorithm 1 TA -W R M F Input: A list of positive ( R ij =1 )( user, search )pairs L including Output: U , Q 1: Initialize U , Q by uniform sampling from (  X  1 , 1) 2: Append all negative ( user, trending search )pairsto L 3: repeat 4: for all ( u i ,q j ) in L do 5: if R ( ij )==1 then 6: Randomly sample m pairs of ( u i ,q x ) ,where 7: Update m pairs of ( u i , q x ) by Eqn. (8) 8: end if 9: Update u i , q j by Eqn. (8) 10: end for 11: until Converge.

Relevance . We assume that the relevance depends on the click count ( c kj )ofanimage( I k ) associated with the trending search ( q ). The higher c kj , the more relevant I k . Thus, the relevance P ( I k | q t j ) is decided by the likelihood of I k given q
Visual Consistency . It is important to determine the represen-tativeness under the assumption that an image with more similar neighbors should have higher chance to be selected [16, 35]. The Bag-of-Visual-Word model on the Scale-Invariant Feature Trans-form (SIFT) features is applied to compute the visual similarity Sim ( I k ,I l ) ofapairofimages ( I k ,I l ) [21, 26]. Then, a ran-dom walk process is adopted to derive the visual consistency [13]. For each trending search q t j , each image I k with c kj ode n k and forms a image set I t j . n k has a directed edge e to node n l if I l belongs to the k -Nearest Neighbor ( k =5 )of I , denoted by kNN ( I k ) . The weight of edge e k,l is given by of I k can be formulated as where E is the transition matrix consisting e i,j , 1l is the vector of ones. The optimal P v ( I k | q t k ) is the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue.

Burstiness . The users not only care about the trending searches but also the reason why they are buzzing. As in Figure 2(C), people would issue  X  X ila Kunis X  at the moment because they are interest-ed in her gossip. Thus, in addition to returning the image with high relevance, it is intuitive to select the one with higher descriptivity of trending search. The image with bursty large amount of increasing clicks from the trending search is assumed with better descriptivi-ty. Hence, we adopt the burstiness P b ( I k | q t j ) of the image I trending search q t j as the measurement of descriptivity, which is similar to Eqn. (1) and can be formulated as where P ( I k | q t j ,d ) is the probability of image I k en trending search q t j at day d . In this work, we focus on demon-strating the effectiveness of different features, especially the burst nature, i.e., burstiness . How to fuse the features for better perfor-mance will be covered in the future. Figure 3: Distribution of users for each search query during 2012/11/01 X 2012/11/13. The figure aims at showing that the trending searches are issued many times and might not have cold-start issue as common searches, so TW-WRMF (CF-based method) can fit our problem.
We have conducted experiments (in cluding trending search de-tection and personalize trending s earch suggestion) on a large-scale search log from a commercial image search engine. The image search logs were collected in the first two weeks of Nov. 2012. Each entry of the log contains five elements &lt; user , query , URL , time , nationality &gt;. The dataset contains 21 millions unique user-s, 41 unique millions queries, and 61 unique millions URLs. Only the search logs in US are used in our data.

Furthermore, in the raw search logs, there are many spam users who aim to promote specific searches to be detected as trends and continuously issue many queries in a short period of time. To re-duce spam queries and users, we regard the users who issue more than 50 search queries in a single search session as spam users and remove their query logs. Two consecutive queries issued within a specific time threshold by a single user are considered in the same search session as defined by [5]. Here, the time threshold is set 30 min to define a single session.

Moreover, search queries with lo w frequency are barely consid-ered trends and provide little information for latent topic learning. Thus, we remove the search queries below a certain threshold (i.e., 3 in this work). After spam users and low frequent searches re-moval, there are 15 millions unique users, 9 unique millions queries and 61 unique millions URLs in the final dataset.

One possible issue of collaborative filtering is the data sparsity (cold-start) problem. However, from Figure 3, trending searches have issued by many users, and thus might not suffer the cold-start problem. This statistic is supportive to collaborative filtering, espe-cially our proposed TA-WRMF.
The trending search detection is based on Eqn. (1) and Eqn. (3). s is set 3 , i.e., the trending strength is referred to the last three days. Searches with top 100 trending scores are claimed trending for e-valuation. For the personalized suggestion, we will first conduct personalized suggestion on editor-labeled trending searches. Then, in the main experiments, trending searches claimed in the detection stage are directly put in the sugges tion list for further personalized ranking without editor selection. There are three reasons for this (A) (B) (C) proposed TA-WRMF, which has the best MAP result. In (B) only the issued ( u Table 1: Personalized suggestion evaluation protocol. For one set of dataset, we use 4-day image search log from which we detect the trending image searches and learn personal interests. Image search log of the 5-th day is used to form testing data. Then, one day is shifted to form another dataset. Such process is repeated to form more datasets. day 1 day 2 day 3 day 4 day 5 day 6 day 7 setting: 1) It is hard to manually labe l the trending searches during 2012 at current time; 2) It is closer to the real application scenario. For example, existing trending s uggestion systems display at most 20 trending searches. It is therefore more convincing to enlarge the general trending list for further re-ranking; 3) The automati-cally detected trending searches also have similar properties, e.g., click-through rate, to the editor-selected. The framework should be applicable when more editor-selected trending searches are avail-able.

Table 1 lists the personalized suggestion evaluation protocol. We simulate the suggestion evaluation based on evaluation of predic-tion problem. Assume the target is to suggest the trending searches of day d (e.g., day 4 ) to the users in day ( d +1 ) (i.e., day 5 in the example). The users who have issued any trending searches in the day ( d +1 ) will be considered as testing users. For each testing user, the corresponding trending searches issued by him/her in the day ( d +1 ) are considered relevant.

Generally, the search logs from ( d  X  s )today d (e.g., day 1 to day 4 in the example) are considered as training data. But for better experimental efficiency, in addition to testing users, only any oth-er user who has ever issued any trending search at least generated three queries in the training data is regarded as training user. The query q j issued by training user u i is included as training query. After one set of experiment (day 1 to day 5 ), we shift one day (e.g., day 2 to day 6 in the Table 1) to have another training and testing data. Then, the evaluation process is repeated. Totally, we have 9 sets (2012/11/04 X 2012/11/12) in the experiments. For evaluation, Table 2: Trending search detection results. Our weighted sum scheme outperforms the max difference [1] in terms of both MAP and Recall.
 the mean average precision (MAP) is adopted: where U d is the testing user set corresponding to the trending search-es of day d , rel u t relevant to the user u t i ,and P ( k ) is precision @ k .
For trending search representative image selection, we focus on addressing the effectiveness of burstiness . Therefore, three features will be directly compared in the experiments without further fusion. The top 20 trending searches are selected from editor-labeled set during 2012/11/04 X 2012/11/13. The representative images are au-tomatic generated by the corres ponding features. Only the highest scored image is viewed as the representative image by each fea-ture. Then, a user study is conducted to evaluate the results. The information why the trending searches were buzzing is manually searched by each subject and then aggregated as the reference to facilitate the subject to get fam iliar with the background of trend-ing events. As a result, we invited six subjects (four males and two females) to score the representativeness of each image, i.e., the a-bility to visualize the reasoning of buzzing. Each user was required to score the selected 20 trending searches. In total, 60 images (20 queries  X  3 representative images by each features) with the scores scale from 1-10 (the higher, the better) are annotated.
Trending search detection . we compare the weighted sum de-tection results with maximum difference [1]. The ground truths are the editor-labeled trending searches during 2012/11/04 X 2012/11/12.
Trending searches suggestion . There are five baselines to com-pare with. Two of them are simply frequency-based methods and able to capture the semantic meanings in the real world.
Trending Search Nearest Neighbors but is promoted to top-20 by the proposed TA-WRMF. the other three are CF-based methods. The baselines are introduced as follows.
Table 2 shows the trending search detection results. First, the weight average scheme performs slightly better (on both MAP and Recall) than the max difference scheme as in [1]. The major rea-son is that the weighted average scheme prefers the searches with the statistical volume curves ascending in the convex shape. max difference, on the other hand, is neutral for the shape. However, Figure 6: Evaluation of representative image selection. Busti-ness has the best performance among all the users. if the curve is in the concave shape, the search should be trend-ing earlier rather than the current moment and this situation cannot be distinguished by max difference. Therefore, weighted average has slightly better performance. Besides, our approach achieves good coverage (Recall) of the trend detection. 90% editor-labeled trending searches during the period are discovered by our detection algorithm. Thus, if the personali zed suggestion works well on the automatic detected trending searches, it should perform well given editor-labeled trending searches.
The personalized suggestion on t he 20 editor-labeled trending searches improves the MAP from 0 . 37 (MPC) to 0 . 55 (TA-WRMF), which supports the intuition of personalized suggestion. Then, we focus on showing and analyzing the results on the 100 automati-cally detected search trends. From Figure 4 (A), we can see that TA-WRMF outperforms all other baselines with 15% and 50% rel-ative improvements compared t o CF-based methods and frequency-based method, respectively. As MPC does not use any person-al information, it has the wors t performance on recommendation. PF+MPC does improve a lot from MPC due to the use of personal log data. Furthermore, when we start to leverage the information from similar users, there is anot her improvement observed in the figure. Based on the performance from WRMF with all queries and SVD, we can see that the weighted regularized scheme does avoid imbalance issue in the OCCF problem. Moreover, leverag-ing more information in addition to the trending searches is help-ful. Nevertheless, including more information from others queries might sacrifice the accuracy of trending searches. This should not happen because the trending searches are our suggestion targets. Therefore, the TA-WRMF increases the error weights of trending searches. The performance of TA-WRMF does confirm the obser-vation with the improvement against others.

To further analyze the results, we separate the evaluations into two conditions: 1) for each user u i , only the trending searches ( q not issued in the training data , i.e., R i,j =0 , are regarded rel-evant candidates (called non-issued relevant ), as results shown in Figure 4(B); and 2) conversely, for each user u i , only the queries ( q ) issued in the training data, i.e., R i,j =1 , are regarded rele-vant candidates (called issued relevant ), as results shown in Figure 4(C). The objective is to deeply understand where the improvement comes from. Although there is an interference between these two conditions 9 , the results provide much information. (A) Burstiness (B) Relevance (C) Visual consistency (D) Editor selection (E) Reason for the trend Figure 7: Example of trending-aware representative image se-lection. Four images are preferred by different methods (A-D), and (E) provides why  X  X on Lemon X  was buzzing during the pe-riod. The Twitter feud between  X  X on Lemon X  and  X  X onah Hill X  caused the burst and only the burstiness boosted the headshots of the two (A) to the top rank.

From Figure 4 (B)(C), we can see that if we just pull the issued searches to the top, then the performance of issued relevant is the best but the performance of non-issued relevant suffers severely, even worse than MPC (general suggestion). On the other hand, the CF-based models all outperform MPC on both conditions. This demonstrates the information from neighborhood users does help. While preferring the issued trending searches as PF does, the well-learned latent interests also have the ability to not only boost some non-issued relevant trending searches but also filter out some noisy issued trending searches. Among the CF-based models, SVD per-forms worse in both conditions due to imbalance of zeros. Thus, it does not fit well for the issued searches and the non-issued relevant are not boosted as well. WRMF (trending search only) might over-fit the issued trending searches ( q t j where R ij =1 ), so the issued relevant searches are not ranked high. WRMF (with all queries) and IBCF have similar performance. They are both good on issued relevant suggestion while overlooking the importance of trending searches. Hence, the accuracy of issued relevant trending search-es are sacrificed and the overall performance is dropped. Finally, our proposed TA-WRMF achieves good performance for the issued relevant trending searches, and at the same time, some non-issued relevant trending searches are successfully ranked high. Therefore, the performance of issued relevant condition is also competitive . In short, TA-WRMF has competitive performances under both conditions and thus has the best overa ll trending search suggestion performance. Figure 8: The sensitivity test results of W P , i.e., the weight of positive pairs of users and trending searches, which show the effectiveness of taking more care on trending searches.

Qualitative Analysis . Figure 5 and Table 3 provide some quali-tative analysis. Table 3 shows that the latent space of search queries is quite meaningful by selecting some trending searches with their 5 nearest neighbors (NN) in the latent space. For example,  X  X atie price wedding dress train X  is surrounded by many other wedding dress related queries. The neighbor s  X  X ichtenstein castle X  are also some landmarks, especially castles. Thus, it is reasonable to expect the suggested trending searches ar e semantically consistent to user interest.
 Figure 5 shows more trending searches suggestions (top 20). First, we can find some semantic consistency between personal search logs and suggested results. For example, user #2 concerns more about travel, related trending search, e.g.,  X  X euschwanstein castle, X  is ranked very high. The issued relevant searches also achieve good performance, e.g.,  X  X a rack Obama X  and  X  X ichtenstein castle X  for user #1 and user #2. Some issued relevant trending searches are boosted according to the personal interest as some sci-ence related trending searches is suggested to the user #3 who has generated plenty of sci ence related queries.
Figure 6 shows the evaluation results of representative image se-lection by user study. All the invited subjects agree with the effec-tiveness of burstiness , which achieves the best performance among all features. Figure 7 shows the example of representative image selection. During the testing time (Nov. 2012),  X  X on Lemon, X  an anchor of CNN, was a trending search target as he had a Twitter feud with  X  X onah Hill, X  a Hollywood star, as shown in Figure 7(E). The relevance feature would pick the image with high popularity in the past, but does not concern the burst nature, i.e., what crowd re-ally desires to see during the period, as shown in Figure 7(B). The visual consistency feature only considers the visual information, and thus cannot capture the character as well, as shown in Figure 7(C). On the other hand, the burstiness feature is able to detect re-cency, and rank the related images to the top more successfully, as shown in Figure 7(A).
We discuss the parameters in pe rsonalized trending search sug-gestion, including W P , W N ( m =1 ) in Eqn. (6). The sensitivity test results can be seen in Figure 8 and 9. Figure 8 shows the results of W P , i.e., the importance of positi ve pairs of user and trending searches. The MAP reaches maximum when W P =5 . Figure 9 shows the sensitivity test results of W N , i.e., the weight of negative pairs of user and search. Because of the imbalance issue, smaller W
N should be better as shown in the figure. W N =0 . 1 reaches the best MAP. However, when we keep lowering W N , the mod-Figure 9: The sensitivity test results of W N , i.e., the weight of negative pairs of users and search queries, which shows low W
N can save the imbalance issue. el would overfit the positive pairs of user and search, and thus the performance would be degraded.
To conclude, we have come up with a learning-based person-alized trending image search suggestion framework, composed of two stages. First, we propose the trending-aware weight regular-ized matrix factorization (TA-WRMF) to learn the user interest by neighbor users with the help of auxiliary items, i.e., common searches. Then, different features, including burstiness are investi-gated for representative image selection of trending search. By the large-scale real commercial image search log, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our personali zed suggestion model and trending-aware image selection features.

In the future, we will improve the personalized trending image search suggestion system in two-fold. First, we will leverage more information source to detect trending searches. For example, it is discovered that social media is able to shorten the trend detection latency to about 4.5 hours [15]). Second, we are trying to perform deeper understanding of the user. Long-term user preference (e.g., extending the training data to monthly scale) is aimed to be discov-ered to compensate the insufficiency of short-term interest learned. Besides, it is also desired to mine and aggregate other information such as user attributes or social networks for the cold-start users. [1] Z. Al Bawab, G. H. Mills, and J.-F. Crespo.
