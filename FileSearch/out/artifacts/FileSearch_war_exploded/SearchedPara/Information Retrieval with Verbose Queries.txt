Proposed duration is a full-day tutorial. The current plan is to di-vide the tutorial into two main parts, each focusing on applications of the discussed techniques to verbose natural language queries. 1. Query reduction, reformulation and segmentation techniques. 2. Query concept weighting, expansion and learning-to-rank.

 Intended Audience
Information retrieval with verbose natural language queries has gained a lot of interest in recent years both from the research com-munity and the industry. Search with verbose queries is one of the key challenges for many of the current most advanced search platforms, including question answering systems (Watson or Wol-fram Alpha), mobile personal assistants (Siri, Cortana and Google Now), and entity-based search engines (Facebook Graph Search or Knowledge Graph). Therefore, we believe that a tutorial on this topic at SIGIR is very timely and will attract a lot of interest from all conference participants.

Researchers in the field of analysis of search queries will benefit the most, as this tutorial will give them an exhaustive overview of the research in the direction of handling verbose web queries. We believe that the tutorial will give the newcomers a complete pic-ture of the current work, introduce important research topics in this field, and inspire them to learn more. Practitioners and people from the industry will clearly benefit from the discussions both from the methods perspective, as well from the point of view of applications where such mechanisms are starting to be applied.

After the tutorial, the audience will be able to appreciate and un-derstand the following: (1) What are the interesting properties of complex natural language verbose queries; (2) Challenges in effec-tive information retrieval with verbose queries; (3) State-of-the-art

Recently, the focus of many novel search applications shifted from short keyword queries to verbose natural language queries. Examples include question answering systems and dialogue sys-tems, voice search on mobile devices and entity search engines like Facebook X  X  Graph Search or Google X  X  Knowledge Graph. However the performance of textbook information retrieval techniques for such verbose queries is not as good as that for their shorter coun-terparts. Thus, effective handling of verbose queries has become a critical factor for adoption of information retrieval techniques in this new breed of search applications.

Over the past decade, the information retrieval community has deeply explored the problem of transforming natural language ver-bose queries using operations like reduction, weighting, expansion, reformulation and segmentation into more effective structural rep-resentations. However, thus far, there was not a coherent and orga-nized tutorial on this topic. In this tutorial, we aim to put together various research pieces of the puzzle, provide a comprehensive and structured overview of various proposed methods, and also list vari-ous application scenarios where effective verbose query processing can make a significant difference.
After the tutorial, the audience will be able to appreciate and un-derstand the following: (1) What are the interesting properties of complex natural language verbose queries; (2) Challenges in effec-tive information retrieval with verbose queries; (3) State-of-the-art techniques for verbose query transformations that yield better ex-pected search performance; (4) State-of-the-art ranking methods for verbose queries, including supervised learning-to-rank methods (5) What user/industry segments can be affected by better retrieval with verbose queries and what are the possible applications.
As can be seen from the long list of referenced papers, in this tutorial, we will organize related work done by the information re-trieval community in the past decade, present it as a coherent story, and summarize the research advances in the field of information retrieval with verbose queries. Thus, it is clearly relevant to the IR community. The theme of the proposed tutorial is most related to the  X  X ueries and Query Analysis X  area of SIGIR 2015. It is also re-lated to a successful series of workshops on  X  X uery Representation and Understanding X  held at SIGIR 2010 and 2011.

To the best of our knowledge, no previous tutorials have been offered on this research topic.
Here is a brief outline of the topics covered by the tutorial with relevant references. specificity [35], repetition factor [37], percentage of searches covered by top-K% queries [37], smoothing mechanisms [46].  X  Query Reduction to a Single Sub-Query  X  Query Reduction by Choosing Multiple Sub-Queries  X  Weighting Query Concepts
Following is a list of related topics that we do not cover as part of this tutorial: (1) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), (2) Pro-cessing null queries other than verbose queries, (3) Query by Doc-ument, (4) Query processing tasks for short queries.
