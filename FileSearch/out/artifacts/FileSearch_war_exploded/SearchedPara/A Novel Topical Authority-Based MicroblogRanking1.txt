 The recent proliferation of micro-bloggi ng causes tens of thousands of micro-blogs produced daily. The availability of the large amount of microblog data, often together with the user profiles, allows a number of data mining tasks possible, e.g., hot topic detection [1], opi nion leader detection [2], etc. Yet, this also brings new challenges to microblog search engines like Twitter, in particular the high demand of billions of daily search queries and the need to provide high quality microblogs for users. Microblogs are known to be fragmental and ephemeral, making accurate content filtering and retrieval non-trivial and also a hot research area. Various ranking strategies for microblogs have been proposed in the literature. The approaches adopted include the use of the content and specific features (e.g., tags) of the microblogs, as well as the bloggers X  social structure (e.g, the author X  X  popularity).

In general, the content-based strategies adopt variations of TFIDF-based co-sine similarity to measure the content popularity [3]. And for those strategies based on microblog specific features [4], the number of hashtags, the length of tweet, the presence of URLs, and the number of retweets, etc., have been pro-posed for ranking tweet data. For the authority-based approach, the basic idea is to rank the tweets of the authors with more followers or more retweets higher. Intuitively, each author has his/her ow n expertise of some specific areas. For example, Alex J. Smola -the prestigious machine learning researcher has high authority in machine learning related domains, his twitter account  X  X smolix X  distributes lots of useful resources related to ML research but few posts dis-cussing food, trips etc. Thus treating author authority with no topical difference might not be appropriate in microblog ranking.

In [5], the Gaussian ranking algorithm for microblogs topical authority identi-fication was proposed based on a set of so-called topical features which indicate the topical signals over tweets and authors. The use of the approach is mainly for the influential author detection. And its optimality is pretty much relying on the assumption that each feature follows a Gaussian distribution with their parameters estimated from the data.

In this paper, we propose to incorporate author X  X  topical authority to en-hance the performance of microblog ranking, with the conjecture that the topi-cal authorities of the authors are good and robust signals to indicate the degree of relevancy with the query keywords. An d we develop topical authority-based methodologies and conduct experiments in a Twitter dataset. Detailedly speak-ing, other than extending the set of topical features proposed in [5], we also adopt different parametric forms of probability distribution for the feature mod-eling so that the accuracy of our proposed cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) based approaches can be further optimized. The experimental results showed that our proposed approaches can significantly improve the ranking per-formance measured based on normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) by over 20% when compared to both Gaussian-based and conventional ranking approaches. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate topical authority into microblog ranking.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related work of microblog ranking and identification of topical authorities. Sec-tion 3 presents the feature extraction of all topical and conventional features, followed by several novel authority-based ranking methods. The details of the feature distribution modelling are described in Section 4. Section 5 reports the experimental results and performance evaluation. The conclusion and future work are presented in Section 6.
 In the literature, there exist lots of work on microblog ranking. The importance of considering author authority in Twitter author ranking was first demonstrated in [6]. TweetRank and FollowerRank [7] were proposed to rank tweets by con-sidering the number of tweets posted by an author and the proportion of the followers in his networks, respectively. Different hybrid approaches that incorpo-rate content relevance, user authority a nd tweet-specific features have also been considered to suppor t real-time search and ranking [8,4]. In the literature, the existing works have validated the contribution of publishing authority to the mi-croblog ranking approaches. However, the author authority is based on the con-ventional popularity instead of being evaluated in topics. And ranking the microblogs in consideration of author X  X  topical authority is rarely discussed.
In domains other than microblog ranking, identification of topical author au-thority was first investigated by Jianshu et al. [9]. TwitterRank was proposed to identify author authority, which is a PageRank [10] similar approach by adopt-ing both topical similarity and link structure. The topical distribution is con-structed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm [11], and then a weighted user graph is derived accordingly with its edge weight indicating the topical similarity between authors. However the high complexity of the approach can not meet the requirement of real-time ranking. Aditya et al. [5] emphasized on real-time performance and first proposed a set of features for characteriz-ing the topical authorities. They performed a probabilistic clustering over the feature space and computed a final list of top-k authors for a given topic by Gaussian-based inner-cluster ranking.

In this paper, we aim to enhance the ranking performance by identifying and incorporating topical authority into microblog ranking scheme. Detailedly, we i) propose two new features based on [5] as the author X  X  topical follower signal and the conventional popularity signal respectively, and ii) adopt different para-metric distributions for feature modeling so as to relax the Gaussian distribution assumption. This relaxation is particularly crucial as the cumulative distribution function values are explicitly used to compute the the ranking. Also, we evaluate the effectiveness of topical author authority in microblog ranking. In this section we will present the featur e extraction of all to pical and conven-tional features as well as several novel authority-based ranking methods. 3.1 Topical Authority Feature Construction We adopt and extend the topical authority metrics and features proposed in [5] to further enhance microblog ranking performance. And to make this paper self-contained we include some details of [5].
 Topical Metrics in Microblogs. Following the setup of [5], we also utilize a list of metrics extracted and computed for each potential authority. Table 1 tabulates the metrics proposed in [5], where OT, CT, RT, M and G stand for metrics associated with the original tweet s, conventional tweet s, repeated tweets, mentions and graph-based characteristics , respectively. All the features indicate the morphology of tweets (the number of embedded URLs, hashtags, etc.), the way they are used (re-tweeting, mentions or conventional tweets), or the signal of author X  X  topical interests. We here propose two additional metrics, F 1and F 2, to indicate author popularity as people tend to have strong interests in celebrities. We then use these two metrics to define new features.
 Topical Features in Microblogs. Most of the topical features adopted in this paper are again based on [5] as shown in Table 2. Among them, TS indicates how much an author is involved with a specific topic. SS estimates the originality of author X  X  topical tweets which also indicates author X  X  topical signal. Additionally, C S estimates how much an author posts on a topic and how far he wanders from the topic into casual conversations. C S is proposed to distinguish real people from the agents or organizations, since people incline to fall into conversations out of courtesy. Referring to  X  in C S ,itisusedtodiscountthefactthatthe author did not initiate the conversation but simply replied back out of politeness. Intuitively, CS is less than OT 1 OT 1+ CT 2 , and thus we can solve for  X  with this constraint. Empirically, we solve  X  to satisfy over 90% of users in our dataset. RI considers how many times the author  X  X  tweets have been retweeted by others so as to measure the content impact of author. MI is used to estimate the mention impact. Feature ID is to estimate the diffused influence by the author in his own networks. And NS is to estimate the raw number of topical active users around the author. For OT21 and OT41 , they indicate the rate of link and keyword hashtag in original tweets respectively. OT3 reflects the portion of words an author borrows from his previous posts including both on and off of words s i and s j which are extracted from the author X  X  i th and j th tweets repectively. Moreover, before computing the scores, we should make author X  X  tweets in time order, and apply stemming and stop-word removal.

Intuitively, for a specific area, the more followers an author has, the more in-fluential he is; and the more attention an a uthor receives, the more authoritative he is. Thus, we propose to include feature F 12 as the conventional popularity signal considering that people tend to have g reat interests in celebrities X  opinions, and also feature GF 1 to indicate the author X  X  topical follower signal. Both newly added features are found to be effective o nes based on our empirical results. 3.2 Cumulative Distribution-Based Ranking Since all the topical authority features are assumed to follow Gaussian distribu-tion in [5], which however may not be true as to be discussed in Sec. 4.2. We adopt the feature distribution modelling approach in this paper and compute the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the topical authority features to calculate the author X  X  Authority Score ( AS ). For author x i , AS is defined as: where F f denotes the CDF of feature f with parameter  X  f and m is the number of features (similarly herei nafter). With the conject ure that the conventional authority features and topical authority features may carry different weights, one can explore a weighted version of the Authority Score, given as: where  X   X  (0 , 1) denotes the trade-off parameter between topical authority and conventional authority. In our exper iments, the empirical settings of  X  are over 0 . 7.
Other than the proposed CDF-based ranking approaches, there exist a number of other possibilities (Seen in Table 3). Conv based corresponds to the ranking method based on conventional author popularity with only feature F 12 used as the authority score. Gaus-10 refers to the Gaussian-based ranking method with AS defined as m f =1 x f i  X  X  X  N ( x ;  X  f , X  f ) dx ,where  X  f and  X  f denote the mean and standard deviation of feature f . SUM-based defines the AS as m f =1 x f i , and SUM-12 corresponds to summation over all 12 features shown in Table 2. Similarily, MUL-based method defines AS as m f =1 x f i .
 In this section, we first present the st atistics of the Twitter dataset we used and then suggest better design of the probability distribution for each feature to achieve the model optimality. 4.1 DataSet We use a Twitter dataset which was collected from June 11st 2009 to October 8th 2009. All collected tweets together with their relationship profiles takes up about 65 . 8 G storage space. We select five hot hastags as the keywords. They are google, healthcare, iran, music and twitter . For each keyword, we collect thousands of most recent and best matche d tweets via substring matching and obtain the corresponding authors X  relationship.

The statistics of our dataset are shown in Table 4, where | MTN | means the number of matched tweets by keywords, | UTN | indicates the number of unique authors. | UFoN | and | UTFoN | represent the number of unique followers and that of unique topical followers respectively. Similarly, | UFrN | and | UTFrN | indicate the number of unique friends and that of unique topical friends respectively. 4.2 Feature Distributions of Different Parametric Forms We first group the features into four categories based on the form of their under-lying distributions. The groupings are { ID, GF1 } , { TS, F12 } , { MI, RI, OT41 } , and { NS, OT3, OT21, CS, SS } . For each category, they fit the corresponding features with distribution functions of same parametric form. Due to the page limit, we only present some of the features in detail here.

Fig.1 shows the probability distributions of different features. It can be easily noted that features ID, GF1 and MI can be fitted well by Gaussian distribution, and features TS and NS are unlikely Gaussian. Fig.2 gives the Q-Q plots (where  X  X  X  stands for quantile) of some features based on the Gaussian assumption. It is obvious that only features ID and GF1 end up with good fitting as indicated by having not too many points deviated from the straight line y = x . For features TS and NS , they are found to be better fitted with Lognormal and Gaussian mixture model respectively, as evidenced in Fig. 3, compared to Gaussian fitting result shown in Fig.2. For feature RI , we can hardly find an appropriate distribution to fit it since its values are too concen trated around zero. And we adopt the method that divides its range into n equal parts first and then turns the discrete probability mass function into a continuous one to calculate its CDF.
For the distributions we adopted, we apply the Maximum Likelihood Estima-tion to obtain their model parameters. For the sake of brevity, we only present the parameter estimation steps for Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). GMM is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points to be generated from a linear superposition of Gaussian compon ents which provides a richer class of density models than the single Gaussian.

Considering that we have n data points x = { x 1 ,x 2 ,...,x n } in d -dimensional space (in our case, d = 1), the log likelihood with respect to a GMM can be denoted as: where {  X  k , s.t. K k =1  X  k =1 } is the prior probability over the K Gaussian com-ponents, and (  X  k , X  k ) are mean and standard deviation (model parameters) of the k th Gaussian component. Then we use the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to maximize the log likelihood to estimate the unknown parameters. Due to the page limits, we skip the details of EM process.
Recall that we have proposed Authority Score( AS ) based on the features X  CDF in Sec.3.2. For feature f fitted by GMM, its CDF value of author x i is defined as, Figs.4-6 give the plots of the empirical densities of some features together with their fitting results of  X  X oogle X  dataset based on different models. We can observe that univariate Gaussian and Lognormal fitting have achieved good performance for feature ID and TS respectively. Fig.6 shows the GMM-based fitting and Gaussian-based fitting of feature NS. Obviously, GMM-based approach achieves more accurate fit than the univariate Gaussian-based one. While preparing for the evaluation of our proposed ranking approaches, we man-ually labelled each tuple &lt; query keyword, tweet &gt; with a method which is similar to 3-point Likert scale, considering how relevant the tweet is to the query key-word and the amount of information it carries. 5.1 Evaluation Metric To evaluate the ranking results, we adopt Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) as the metric which is based on DCG [12]. NDCG measures the effectiveness of the ranking methods by penalizing the position from the result list with normalization. It is defined as: where G i is the label of i th tweet in the final ranked list, and Z n is a normalization factor, which is used to make the value of NDCG of the ideal list to be 1. 5.2 Evaluating Author Ranking Results In Table 5, we present the top 10 authors of each dataset selected by CDF-12 approach. With careful manual effort checking with Twitter, we find that the top-10 list is dominated by celebrities, popular bloggers and organizations. Besides, our method also discovers those authors who focus on certain areas and have a small number of followers (denoted in bold font). 5.3 Evaluating Microblog Ranking Results We re-rank our dataset according to author Authority Score( AS ) which is calcu-lated by the methods described in Sec.3.2. In this section, we present the results of only two of the five topics ( X  X oogle X  and  X  X ealthcare X ) due to the page limit. Figs. 7 and 8 show the top-k ranking performance in terms of NDCG k (seen in Sec.5.1), where k varies from 5 to 1 , 000.

It is obvious that the CDF weighted approach outperforms the others. Ac-cording to Fig.7, we observe that the performance of Conv based ranking method drops sharply with the increasing value of k in general. For another topic ( X  X ealth-care X ) that corresponds to Fig.8, the Conv based method also underperforms our proposed approaches by a large margin. The phenomenon further demonstrates the effectiveness of the adoption of the topical authority in microblog ranking.
Figs. 7 and 8 show that CDF-10 performs much better than its Gaussian version (i.e., Gaus-10 ), which verifies the benefit b rought by the more accurate feature modeling in the CDF-based method. Also, we can observe that CDF-12 outperforms CDF-10 except for the top-5 case of the topic  X  X oogle X . This demonstrates the benefit brought by the two newly proposed authority features. Furthermore, the CDF weighted approach further boosts the ranking quality by making an appropriate trade-off between the conventional popularity feature and the topical authority features. In addition, we adopt SUM-based and MUL-based approaches for benchmarking. And the CDF-based ones perform much better than the non-CDF-based approaches.

To summarize, our proposed CDF weighted approach enhances the rank-ing performance significantly and perform best among all the proposed ap-proaches. Quantitative analysis over the performance of the approaches show that CDF weighted achieves more than 20% enhancement as compared to the conventional method as well as the Gaussian-based ranking method. In this paper, we first proposed to adopt the topical authority in microblog ranking and investigated to what extent the topical feature modeling can be optimized for boosting the performance of topical authority-based microblog ranking. Our attempts include extending the set of features considered and im-proving the feature modelling step. We applied the proposed extensions to a Twitter data set and compared the corresponding tweet ranking results with a number of existing methods for benchma rking. The experimental results vali-dated the effectiveness of our proposed approaches and showed that the weighted version of CDF-based method outperforms other ones.

For future work, we will further investigate how the trade-off weight can be optimized for enhancing the microblog ranking quality. In addition, we are also interested in incorporating more features, e.g., content-based features, to further improve the microblog ranking quality.
