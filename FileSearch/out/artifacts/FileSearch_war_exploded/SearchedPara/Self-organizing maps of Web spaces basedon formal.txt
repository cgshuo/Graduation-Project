 1.Introduction
The availability of electronic information and the processes of digitalization have doubtless contributed to the exponential growth of information that has been an issue of discussion now for more than two decades (Price, 1973). It has been clear for some time that the great quantity of information available on Internet X  X  X he number of Web pages surpassed 2000 million in the summer of the year 2000 (Aguillo, 2000b) and in January 2002 the number of hosts on Internet surpassed 140 million (Internet Software Consortium, 2002) X  X  X akes it necessary to set up mechanisms to examine that information and to analyse and normalize the design and the special characteristics of  X  X  X eb spaces X  X  X  X  X n expression used by Smith (1999) X  X  X hat contain this infor-mation (Kelly, 1999; Shneiderman, 1997; Strain &amp; Berry, 1996; Trochim, 1996). In this sense, the media of surveillance and analysis of Web spaces that offer scientific or technical information find themselves in a particularly critical situation since any individual or entity, without due authority or recognition and for personal or commercial interests, is able to make apparently scientific or technical declarations that can introduce biases into the situation.

Even in the most superficial observation of Web spaces one comes across such a wide variety of styles, types, designs, and content that one is led to imagine that very few of them were elaborated with what would be a desirable level of depth and professionalism. It is hence natural to wonder whether, especially for governmental and private institutions, it is worth investing funds in something that is possibly generating a loss of institutional or individ-ual image, presenting a different reality because of a lack of professional assessment, planning, oversight, or even a minimum of requirements in the elaboration of Web sites (Correa-Uribe, 1999).

There have been numerous theoretical proposals for analysis that have taken these concerns as their basis. Such studies necessarily involve the implicit recognition that, however dissimilar the information sources on the Web are, they share some common characteristics or quality indica-tors each of which can be assigned the equivalent of an evaluation score. The ultimate goal of all these studies is no less than identifying the characteristics of Web spaces that best satisfy the requirements of users who browse through them (Ma, 2002). Some workers have proposed the-oretical models for the analysis of the characteristics and Web resources that would be applicable to any field on the Internet, i.e., these are theoretical studies of general criteria for the analysis of the information contained in Web spaces (Codina, 2000; Correa-Uribe, 1999; Jim enez-Piano, 2001; Smith, 1996, 1997; Tillman, 2000; Zhang &amp; Dran, 2000; Zimmerman, Muraski, Estes, &amp;
Hallmark, 1997); others, however, have proposed applications of general evaluation for such diverse specific thematic areas as medicine (Aguillo, 2000a; Chu &amp; Chan, 1998; Garrison, 1998;
Pendergrass, Nosek, &amp; Holcomb, 2001), chemistry (Yates, 2000), government Web spaces (Smith, 2001), and specialized libraries (Osorio, 2001), inter alia.

From our perspective, when our aim is to work with a considerable quantity of Web spaces, most of the characteristics analysed in these theoretical models are too lacking in precision and too difficult to quantify. To overcome this problem, certain Web space evaluation models have been developed based exclusively on the analysis of formal characteristics that can be extracted automatically, thereby ensuring greater objectivity in the results (Nicholas, Huntington, &amp; Wil-liams, 2002; Woodruff, Aoki, Brewer, Gauthier, &amp; Rowe, 1996).
 Taking Web spaces in closed generic environments such as the case of the Spanish Region of
Extremadura, as the basis of the study, our working hypothesis is that there exist relationships between certain purely formal characteristics of a Web space and its type as normally determined by its nature or properties (origin, theme, etc.). Our objective is to test this hypothesis using a method based on self-organizing maps (SOMs). In particular, we use a map in which the vectors are the formal characteristics of the Web spaces, and represent the Web spaces on that map on the basis of their nature. 2.Materialandmethods
Our study population consisted of 1180 Web spaces linked by their relationship with the Ex-tremadura Region. We decided to first choose a source that offered Web spaces belonging to our study environment and from these we would retrieve further Web spaces on Extremadura by following the outlinks. Hence, taking as the principal evaluation criterion the  X  X  X uthority X  X  of the source, we selected  X  X  X xtremadura on Internet X  X , the Web server of the Junta of Extremadura (the supreme official organism in the Autonomous Community) which compiles URLs of and about the Region of Extremadura ( http://www.juntaex.es/todoweb ). This  X  X  X xtremadura on Internet X  X  compilation consists of three categories of URL: Web sites, Web pages including personal pages, and sets of Web pages lodged on other servers (Faba-P erez, Guerrero-Bote, &amp; Moya-Aneg on, 2003a). We considered the three categories conjointly under the generic term of  X  X  X eb spaces X  X  from or about Extremadura (Smith, 1999). 2.1. Formal characteristics and their assigned weights
As we noted at the beginning of the work, we shall be focusing only on certain formal char-acteristics of Web spaces. These characteristics are:  X  New Pages . Pages that have changes in the last month.  X  External Links . Links from a given Web space to another Web space different from that of the origin (external outlinks). The greater or lesser number of external outlinks will determine the  X  X  X rightness X  X  of the originating Web space (Bray, 1996; Codina, 2000).  X  Metadata . Indicates the presence of different types of META tags.  X   X  Dublin Core  X  Metadata . The DCMES (Dublin Core Metadata Element Set) subset of META tags, consisting of 15 elements relating to content ( Coverage , Description , Type , Relation ,
Source , Subject , Title ), to intellectual property ( Contributor , Creator , Publisher , Rights ), and to specific aspects of the document  X  s configuration ( Date , Format , Identifier , Language ).  X  Main Metadata . This characteristic includes a subset of Metadata considered of special rele-vance for access to the information ( Author , Creator , Keywords , Subject , Description , Title ,
Date ).  X  Hypertextual Density . Number of HTML links per page of the Web space.  X  Multimedia Density . Number of multimedia objects per page of the Web space.  X  Small Pages . Pages smaller than 3 KB.  X  Broken Links ( External and Internal ). Broken outlinks in a Web space. The possible causes in-clude: File Not Found, Cannot Connect, Host Not Found, and Time Out.  X  Pages with No Title . Pages with a blank (null or white space) in the Title HTML tag or with no such tag.  X  Slow Pages . Pages (generally larger than 50 KB) that take more than 20 or 30 s to load.  X  Broken Anchors . Broken anchors in Web spaces, i.e., problems of hypertext linking to places within a document.  X  Links with Non-Critical Problems . Outlinks in Web spaces that do not function correctly be-cause of some type of problem considered of minor importance (e.g., temporary or permanent redirect).
  X  Pages with No Image Attributes . Pages with images that have no Height , Width or Alt attribute assignments.  X  Old Pages . Pages that have been unchanged for the last 6 months.  X  Deep Pages . Pages that require more than 4 clicks to get to from the front page.
In order for these characteristics to be equiparable, it was first necessary to assign them a weight according to their relevance for retrieval of the information. To this end, we chose a range of weights from ) 0.5 to 0.3. The basis for the choice of these weights is the following:  X  New Pages . Given the dynamic nature of the Web (Almind &amp; Ingwersen, 1997) and the ephem-eral nature of its documents (Koehler, 1999), there is considerable importance in updating a
Web space since monthly maintenance may obviate the numerous last-minute adjustments made to Web pages. It is hardly surprising therefore that an  X  X  X pdated X  X  inde xis one of the most important characteristics in all classification schemes that evaluate Web spaces (Codina, 2000; Correa-Uribe, 1999; Jim enez-Piano, 2001; Smith, 1997, 2001; Tillman, 2000; Zhang &amp;
Dran, 2000). Such (at least monthly) maintenance was thus considered in the present work also as of the greatest importance and was assigned a weight of 0.3.  X  External Links . The possession of external links that have been selected and evaluated in accor-dance with some quality criterion and that are reasonably updated is an indispensable quality indicator in evaluating the content of Web spaces (Codina, 2000; Smith, 2001). The existence of
External Links in a Web space is an indispensable element for the determination of its  X  X  X right-ness X  X  and to retrieve information related to a given topic. It was therefore assigned a weight of 0.2.  X  Metadata ,  X  Dublin Core  X  Metadata and Main Metadata . From the viewpoint of information re-trieval, it is advisable to use Metadata in the HEAD element of Web pages since they can in-clude all types of information, in particular, keys to the content of the pages. Also, some search engines use the information embedded in the META elements for indexing and categorizing.
Hence, each of the three categories of Metadata considered was assigned a weight of 0.2.  X  Hypertextual Density . The links in this inde xoverlap the External Links , so that its weight was also considered to be  X  X  X hared X  X  with them, and was assigned the value 0.1.  X  Multimedia Density . This characteristic has to be approached with care since, while it indeed is used as a positive indicator in every classification scheme evaluating Web spaces, it is usually implemented with certain constraints (Codina, 2000; Correa-Uribe, 1999; Jim enez-Piano, 2001; Smith, 1996). It was therefore assigned the weight 0.1.  X  Small Pages . This characteristic is related to the greater or lesser speed of access to the infor-mation, but not to the content. That a Web space has such small pages ensures that it will be loaded and viewed by the end user. Nonetheless, since it is more related to physical aspects than to content, it was assigned the smallest positive weight of 0.1.  X  Broken Links ( External and Internal ). Given, on the one hand, that the connections established by hyperlinks on the Web is the foundation of the citation-analysis type cybermetric studies that allow the identification of and subsequent access to the Web sites that are most relevant to a given topic (McKiernan, 1996), and, on the other, that having operational links to other resources is an indicator of the quality of Web spaces (Jim enez-Piano, 2001; Smith, 1996), it would be very counterproductive for a Web space to have Broken Links , and even more so if these were external (since this would result in isolation from those resources). These problems were therefore assigned the most negative weights in our list: ) 0.3 ( Broken Internal Links ).  X  Pages with No Title . Given that the title is the word or phrase announcing the content of an
HTML page, omitting it involves a considerable information loss. Not surprisingly, its presence in HTML pages is a highly valued indicator of quality in studies of the qualitative evaluation of
Web spaces (Codina, 2000; Correa-Uribe, 1999; Jim enez-Piano, 2001). This characteristic was thus assigned the negative weight ) 0.3.  X  Slow Pages . This characteristic, in terms of information, is related to access time, not to con-tent. But it can become a considerable problem if downloading time is so long that the user is not allowed to get the desired information. In such a case, it becomes a problem of the  X  X  X on X  X -retrieval of information. It was therefore assigned a weight in the middle of the negative indi-cators: ) 0.2.  X  Broken Anchors . Anchors allow hypertextual access to information, and are thus related to the form of access but not to the content. Broken anchors on an HTML page will have a negative effect on access to the part of the document interesting the user (access will have to be sequen-tial) but not on the information itself provided by the page. While negative, it was thus not con-sidered as being too detrimental to the retrieval of information and was assigned a weight of ) 0.1.  X  Links with Non-Critical Problems . These are problems that, in principle, do not involve any failure of the link, but rather some difficulty in its functioning with the consequent  X  X  X elay X  X  in access to the information. It was therefore considered to be a negative indicator but that is not overly detrimental to the retrieval of information, and was assigned the weight ) 0.1.  X  Pages with No Image Attributes . This is a problem of access to the information on the pages rather than of content since, for example, assigning the Height and Width attributes speeds up the browser  X  s rendering of the page because it does not have to wait for the image to load to determine its size and organize the page layout. We therefore considered the lack of attri-butes in the IMG tag to be a negative indicator of intermediate importance for the access to the Web space  X  s information, and it was assigned a weight in the centre of our distribution of negative indices: ) 0.1.  X  Old Pages . From the perspective of access to information, that pages have not been updated in si xmonths does not necessarily mean that they will remain unchecked for much longer than that time. Also, if a page contains static information, there is no reason for it to be obligatorily updated. Despite being catalogued as one of the negative indicators, it was therefore assigned one of the smallest negative weights: ) 0.03.  X  Deep Pages . From the perspective of information retrieval, deep pages interfere with access to information (since they delay it) but not with the content. Also, it is an indicator that is inex-tricably tied to the number of pages in a Web space, and Web spaces can not be penalized for having many pages. Despite being a negative indicator, it was therefore assigned the smallest of the negative weights: ) 0.02.

Table 1 lists the characteristics considered and their corresponding weights (positive weights correspond to desirable characteristics and negative weights to undesirable characteristics).
To obtain the data for each characteristic, we used two tools: a commercial link verifier, and a purpose-designed bot written for the LINUX operating system in C and Shell-script which crawls the pages of the Web spaces and extracts the selected characteristics from them. 2.2. Kohonen X  X  self-organizing map
As against other techniques of reducing multidimensional spaces, such as the multivariate statistical technique MDS (multidimensional scaling) which is more related to an overall view of the data at a macro scale, we used Kohonen  X  s neural network, also known as a SOM (Kohonen, 1982, 1989, 1990, 1995; Kohonen et al., 1999), because, as well as theoretically allowing one to work with an infinite number of variables, it emphasizes certain proximity relationships, and thus allows one to observe on the map how the Web spaces form clusters according to these specific relationships.

This connection-based model has frequently been used for data mining. We used the algorithm to analyse our Web spaces  X  formal features, taking advantage of its capacity to extract the topological relationships between the Web spaces and their formal characteristics.

The most characteristic feature of this type of neural network is a competitive layer which classifies (clusters) the training inputs. The main difference with other competitive layers is that each neuron exerts an influence on its neighbours which decreases with increasing distance from them. This has a biological basis, as has been found for certain primates (Hilera &amp; Mart  X nez, 1995). As a consequence, a bubble of activity is formed in the layer by all those units which are close to the winner. These neighbouring units participate in the corresponding reinforcement of the learning. A result of this in the Kohonen  X  s SOM (unlike other competitive layers) is that units of the hidden layer which are physically close respond to input vectors which are equally close.
These neurons are usually arranged in a two-dimensional array. For this reason, at times the only thing which is of interest is the clustering performed by the hidden layer, and the whole set of training vectors is selected only to see the resulting topological organization.

The algorithm which the neurons put into practice may be summarized in the following steps:  X  Select as winning node (represented by a weight vector with the same dimension as the input) that closest to the presented vector.
  X  Adjust the weight vectors of the winning node and of those corresponding to its neighbourhood by shifting them towards the input vector (in some cases the reinforcement is the same for the whole neighbourhood, and in others it decreases as the distance to the winner increases). This type of network has recently been used for textual data mining (Lagus, Honkela, Kaski, &amp;
Kohonen, 1999), and in particular to generate topological maps of a set of documents, including labeling the zones of influence of each word or term (Chen, Houston, Sewell, &amp; Schatz, 1998; Faba-P erez, Guerrero-Bote, &amp; Moya-Aneg on, 2003b; Guerrero-Bote, 1997; Guerrero-Bote &amp;
Moya-Aneg on, 2001; Guerrero-Bote, Moya-Aneg on, &amp; Herrero-Solana, 2002a, 2002b; Kaski, 1999; Kohonen et al., 1999; Lagus &amp; Kaski, 1999; Lin, 1997; Moya-Aneg on et al., 1999; Moya-
Aneg on, Jim enez-Contreras, &amp; de la Moneda-Corrochano, 1998). 3.Resultsanddiscussion We applied Kohonen  X  s neural networks to extract and display the relationships between the
Web spaces of our population and their weighted formal characteristics. To present the potential of Kohonen  X  s neural algorithm, we started from vectors representing the Web spaces, each with 17 components corresponding to the 17 characteristics using the weighting scheme described in the previous section. The network consists of 40  X  50 neurons, and has a rectangular topology so that each neuron has eight neighbours.

Fig. 1 shows the topology of the network after the training procedure. Each rectangle with a dot inside represents a neuron. The shading represents the distances between the weight vectors of neighbouring neurons, i.e., between the centroids of the clusters to which the said neurons give rise. Training is carried out in two phases: (i) 1000 cycles, 0.05 learning rate, and 40 for the initial neighbourhood parameter progressively reduced to 1 over the course of the 1000 cycles; (ii) 10 000 cycles, 0.02 learning rate, and 10 for the initial neighbourhood parameter again progressively reduced to 1 over the course of the 10 000 cycles.

Also, 17 unit vectors were generated corresponding to the 17 characteristics (all the components of these vectors are set to zero except that corresponding to the given characteristic which is set equal to unity). These vectors were used, on the one hand, to determine the winning neuron for each characteristic, i.e., the neuron whose weight vector is closest to the characteristic  X  s unit vector (these neurons are labeled on the figure), and, on the other, to find the characteristic closest to each neuron  X  s weight vector so that the set of all neurons corresponding in this sense to a given characteristic determines the characteristic  X  s zone of influence, represented in Fig. 1 by separation lines. This procedure has been used by Lin (1997), Chen et al. (1998), Moya-Aneg on et al. (1999) for terms and documents; by Campanario (1995) for journals; and by Guerrero-Bote et al. (2002) for departments. For the sake of legibility in Fig. 1 we have used the abbreviations for each characteristic given in Table 2.

In other words, by means of the network we managed to classify all the Extremadura Web spaces that we found links to onto the nodes of a rectangular grid. The distances, and hence the colours, are indicative of the closeness between Web spaces (classified in the corresponding neurons) in terms of their formal characteristics. For the interpretation of the figure, one might consider the metaphor of a topographical map, where light colours indicate valleys in which cities (neurons) are better communicated and hence more closely related, while the dark colours indicate mountain ranges that constitute isolation barriers.

With respect to the size of the sources used, the largest corresponds to the winning neuron for a characteristic which is within the characteristic  X  s domain; the intermediate size (only SLP/P in the present case) refers to domains that correspond to characteristics whose winning neuron is in some other domain; and, finally, the smallest size affects winning neurons in domains that cor-respond to another characteristic. (A) Let us first look at the results observed on the map of Fig. 1 with respect to the formal char-acteristics  X  One sees that most of the characteristics have a zone of influence and an associated valley in which are classified the Web spaces mainly defined by that characteristic but distinguished more sharply by others. There are seven characteristics that do not have such zones of influence (Dublin Core (DC) Metadata, Main Metadata, Links with Non-Critical Problems, Hypertex-tual Density, Deep Pages, Broken Anchors, and Old Pages). In order to correctly interpret these seven characteristics that do not have their own zone of influence, it is necessary to orga-nize them into three groups: (a) DC Metadata, and Main Metadata; (b) Links with Non-Crit-ical Problems and Hypertextual Density; and (c) Deep Pages, Broken Anchors, and Old Pages.
It is natural that DC Metadata and Main Metadata do not have their own zone of influence since they lie in the middle of the region dominated by the general Metadata characteristic.
Also, the Links with Non-Critical Problems and Hypertextual Density characteristics corre-spond to types of link that also lie within the domain of influence of External Links, which indicates curiously that these two characteristics occur more in Web spaces characterized by a great number of external links. This is easier to understand in the case of the Hypertextual
Density characteristic than in the case of the Links with Non-Critical Problems. In the case of the Deep Pages, Broken Anchors, and Old Pages characteristics, no zones of influence were established because they are characteristics possessed by Web spaces that mostly have other, more outstanding characteristics. The three indicators appear on a dark-coloured ridge on the border of characteristics with which they have some relationship (Broken Internal Links in the case of Deep Pages; Broken External Links in the case of Broken Links; and Small Pages in the case of Old Pages). In these cases, the dark colour that separates them shows that the relationship between neighbouring characteristics is weak.  X  With respect to the other characteristics, some, such as Small Pages, present an intermediate result with a zone of influence with no valley, located on a plateau between the characteristics they are most closely related to. The large valleys are mainly associated with characteristics that are very common in these Web spaces: Slow Pages, Pages with No Image Attributes, Metadata, and New Pages.  X  The corners of the map are occupied by the characteristics: Small Pages, Metadata, New Pages, and Slow Pages. There are mountains between Small Pages and Metadata and between New
Pages and Small Pages, indicating that the Web spaces with large weights in one of them have small weights in the other.

This type of network also allows one to place the Web spaces that obtained the highest scores (calculated as a weighted sum of the characteristics plus a logarithmic size factor (Faba-P erez, 2003; Faba-P erez, Guerrero-Bote, &amp; Moya-Aneg on, 2003c)) on the grid together with the char-acteristics. Thus, Fig. 1 also shows how the 200 top-ranked (in the sense of the above scores) Web spaces are distributed, and hence the scores of the Web spaces that have those characteristics. One sees that these Web spaces are mainly distributed in the zones of Pages with No Image Attribute,
Small Pages, New Pages, and Main Metadata. They are not concentrated in the characteristics labeled as the most negative (Broken Links and Pages with No Title) but in two of the most positive (New Pages and Metadata). In this sense, Fig. 2 shows the same Kohonen network as in the previous figure but now with the 1180 Web spaces of the population represented by their rank according to the aforementioned score. One observes that, although the distribution is very similar to the previous case, there are many Web spaces of smaller weight that are also found in the External Links, Small Pages, and Pages with No Title zones.

With the Kohonen maps we have classified the Web spaces of our population and related them to the different characteristics. The resulting topological organization allowed us to observe the relationships between these characteristics. Using the zones of influence and the distances between neurons we were able to study the presence of each characteristic in the Web spaces. Of especial interest were the cases in which there was no zone of influence because the indicator was not the dominant variable in any Web spaces, and the cases in which there were no valleys because of the dispersion of the Web spaces that shared that characteristic.

At the beginning of this section, we remarked that we had applied the SOM to extract and display the relationships between the Web spaces and their formal characteristics. However, this topological distribution of the network allows us to discover not only the relationships between the characteristics, but also the nature of the Web spaces which are grouped together in the same zone of influence, and, consequently, the relationship between the characteristics and the nature of the Extremadura Web spaces (this being the aspect in which we believe that the success of the
SOM in the present work is founded). Table 3 lists the 10 characteristics that obtained their own zone of influence, and the nature or principal properties of the Web spaces that are included in each of these zones. The seven characteristics without their own zones of influence that appear in the winning zones of other indicators share those indicators  X  Web spaces and hence their nature. (B)Let usnow look attheresults observedon themap ofFig. 1with respect totherelationships that the Kohonen network identified concerning the nature of the Web spaces  X  One observes that the Web spaces in the New Pages zone are mainly lodged on the  X  X  X ame provider X  X  ( www.geocities.com ). This means that these Web spaces have undergone some sort of change in a very short time period. This grouping is logical since in many cases Internet access providers are in continual movement. One also observes the isolation or lack of relation-ship between these Web spaces and the rest, since the border with the neighbouring zones (Pages with No Title, Broken Internal Links, and Broken External Links) is delineated by high barriers.
  X  The Web spaces that are grouped within the External Links and Metadata zones (which, although they neighbour each other, are separated by a semi-dark zone) fall into two quite different types.
There are  X  X  X ersonal pages X  X  (on diverse topics) and  X  X  X ortals X  X  (with a variety of information from or about Extremadura) in the External Links zone, and  X  X  X nstitutional Web spaces X  X  (from or about Extremadura) in the Metadata zone. That external links form the principal characteristic of  X  X  X ortals X  X , and metadata that of  X  X  X nstitutional Web spaces X  X  is not surprising, but that  X  X  X er-sonal pages X  X  are characterized by their external links is a discovery whose importance can not be considered to be lessened by the identification of this same type of Web space as predominant in the winning zone of Broken External Links, since, although they are neighbouring zones, there is no close relationship between their spaces because they are separated by a semi-dark region.
One may infer that personal pages are initially characterized by External Links, but then, from a lack of maintenance, they move over to the Broken External Links zone.  X  Multimedia Density is the main indicator of quality of the  X  X  X ocalities X  X  (towns) of Extremadura and  X  X  X ocal companies X  X  (small family firms) Web spaces. This was to a certain degree an ex-pected result since a good way of making a company  X  s products or a town known is to use images (recall the popular expression  X  X  X  picture is worth a thousand words X  X ). The  X  X  X ocal com-panies X  X  are also clustered in the Small Pages zone. Although at first sight it might seem incon-gruent that small Extremadura companies have two main characteristics that are mutually antagonistic, we found that there exists a certain degree of correlation between Multimedia
Density and Small Pages, so that there is nothing strange in the result.  X  The Web spaces whose principal quality indicator is Broken Internal Links (these are Web spaces on  X  X  X ocalities X  X  of Extremadura) present the same isolated behaviour as the Broken
External Links, since both are surrounded by mountainous zones. This isolation is found even with respect to spaces that deal with the same topic ( X  X  X ocalities X  X ) and that are found in the neighbouring winning zone of Multimedia Density.  X  The Pages with No Title zone includes Web spaces of a great variety of types and content. Basi-cally, one finds personal pages, institutional Web spaces from or about Extremadura (of official organisms and local companies), portals with different themes, and Web spaces with informa-tion on localities and tourism in Extremadura. Given the importance of this indicator, we looked for some common pattern of behaviour amongst this group of Web spaces, bearing in mind that the number of pages in a Web space is a key datum in this characteristic (since, if there are a great number of pages, it would be easy for the title to be missing in some of them). Indeed, we found that in the group of Web spaces with fewer pages (and consequently the more  X  X  X angerous X  X  when there is no title) there were practically no institutional spaces of a certain category, but there were some personal pages.  X  The Web spaces whose principal characteristics are Small Pages and Pages with No Image
Attributes are of the  X  X  X nstitutional Web space X  X  type (although in the second case we also found  X  X  X ortals X  X  and  X  X  X igital publications X  X  X  X  X agazines, newspapers, weekly publications, etc.). Both cases, besides adjoining each other, neighbour other zones whose Web spaces are in some way related to their institutional character. Thus, the Web spaces of the Pages with No Image Attri-butes border those of the  X  X  X ocal companies X  X  of the Small Pages and Multimedia Density zones, and the  X  X  X nstitutional Web spaces X  X  of the Pages with No Title zone. Also, the Slow Pages Web spaces are even closer to the  X  X  X ocal companies X  X  of the Multimedia Density zone and the Meta-data  X  X  X nstitutional Web spaces X  X .
Comparison of the present work with other studies also exclusively based on the analysis of formal characteristics of Web spaces shows that it is the SOM technique used in the present case that brings out a series of  X  X  X idden X  X  relationships which go beyond the description of the Web spaces according to their formal characteristics. Thus, Woodruff et al. (1996) and Nicholas et al. (2002) make detailed analyses of the formal characteristics associated to Web pages and Web sites, respectively. In both cases, the results are descriptive and reflect no hint of any veiled relationship between different Web spaces that possess those characteristics. In the case of
Woodruff et al., 2.6 million HTML documents were analysed, yielding results of the following type: Document Size (mean size  X  4.4 KB, median size  X  2.0 KB, maximum size  X  1.6 MB); Tag/
Size Ratio (constant); Tag Usage (average number of total tags per document  X  71, average number of unique tags per document  X  11), etc. Nicholas, Huntington and Williams compare two
Web sites (NHS Direct and SurgeryDoor) with respect to the description of indicators associated with the formal characteristic  X  X  X se X  X , and find results such as: Pages viewed per user session (mean: NHS Direct  X  12.7 and SurgeryDoor  X  4.6); Number of files downloaded per page (NHS
Direct  X  7.10 and SurgeryDoor  X  9.21), etc. 4.Conclusions
The formal characteristics of Web spaces constitute an objective evaluation tool. We showed that it is feasible to reveal the relational structure of the Web spaces of a generic closed envi-ronment on the basis of the automatic inference of the relationships that are established between then using only their formal characteristics.

We also confirmed that Kohonen  X  s SOM represent one of the most promising techniques for reducing multidimensional spaces to reveal certain relationships between Web spaces, because of their ability to analyse large numbers of cases of a great many variables (as against such other techniques as MDS). But also with the SOM we have shown that there exists a certain relationship between some formal characteristics of the Web spaces and their own intrinsic nature.
Thus, we discovered that the Web spaces consisting of  X  X  X nstitutional Web pages X  X  (originating from official organisms or local family firms) are not found in zones of the map where the pre-dominant properties are the characteristics that are most detrimental to access to information (Broken Links, and Pages with No Title), but instead are found to cluster in one of the most positive domains (Metadata). Curiously,  X  X  X ersonal pages X  X  (with a clearly individual origin) were found to cluster in both one of the most favourable domains for information retrieval (External
Links) and one of the most negative (Broken External Links). One may infer that  X  X  X ersonal pages X  X  are initially characterized by External Links, but then, from a lack of maintenance, they move over to the Broken External Links zone.

This twofold information provided by the SOM (clustering of Web spaces from sharing formal characteristics, and from their intrinsic nature) suggests the overall result that certain categories of
Web spaces share determined formal characteristics. This in turn allows us to give an evaluation of some of these Web space categories. In our particular case, we can draw the conclusion that the  X  X  X nstitutional Web spaces X  X  of Extremadura are more closely related to the Web spaces of their neighbouring zones (which often are also institutional) than the  X  X  X ersonal pages X  X . This means that the former share more common characteristics than the latter. In general, these shared characteristics are not detrimental to information retrieval, thus reflecting the interest of Ex-tremadura  X  s institutional Web sites in the careful design and maintenance of their Web spaces in order to make their information truly accessible.
 We believe that the reciprocity revealed between the formal characteristics and the nature of the Web spaces could be interesting for future studies which analyse Web spaces in different closed
Internet environments, and which are based on either the formal characteristics of those Web spaces or their categorization by type.
