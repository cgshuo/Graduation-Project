 Emergency management and pl anning often involves multiple domain experts with divers e knowledge backgrounds and responsibilities. Current practices in emergency management and planning have not leveraged th e state-of-art technologies in information sharing, synthesis, and analysis. The proposed research will investigate th e process of collaborative sensemaking in emergency pl anning and implement a map-based online system to support this process. H.5.3. [ Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI)] Group and Organization Interfaces: Computer-supported cooperative work General Terms : Measurement, Design, Experimentation Keywords : Collaborative sensemaking, Geo-collaboration, supportive system In emergency management pl anning, collaborative decision usually involves experts with different knowledge backgrounds. To better understand task situati ons and coordinate work, team members need to individually analyze massive data from various sources by leveraging their domain expertise. The success of collaborative sensemaking largely relies on the effectiveness of sharing rele vant information among domain experts and integrating diverse input s into a coherent plan [1, 2]. However, factors like domain ba rrier, temporal disjunction, geographical dispersion, and medi a diversity make collaborative sensemaking in emergency ma nagement a big challenge. Moreover, emergency planning usually involves geospatial information, which is difficult to communicate verbally. To augment human intelligence and maximize the use of human knowledge, computational tools can be helpful because they offer large storage capacity, high retrieval efficiency, fast processing speed, and broadband communication. My research question is how to support co llaborative sensemaking in emergency management with visualization tools. Collaborative sensemaking is important in emergency management and pl anning, where people encounter large amount of information and need to make sense of  X  X hat is going on X . In collaborative sensemaking, information artifacts are often first collected, assessed, and filtered by individuals, and then those artifacts that are relevant and important to the group are integrated and discussed by the whole group. Moving from individual sensemaking to colla borative sensemaking raises some challenges. Current collaboration systems (e .g. email, video-conference, VoIP, etc.) usually do not s upport collaborative sensemaking directly. Though these tools can support social awareness among distributed group members, most of these systems focus on widening the communicative band, but conveying information does not necessarily result in the mutual understanding of the meaning, which is especially true when the inference needs domain expertise. In highly specialized emergency situations, such as em ergency room in the hospital, to achieve collaborative sensemaking, people make use of whatever possible artifacts to increase articulation [3]. Societal planning tasks are inhe rently wicked problems which are ill-defined and without clear stopping rule [4]. Visual analytic is a key technique to get insight of this kind of wicked problems [5]. Dynamic nature and complex interdependent constraints in emergency planni ng determine that collaborative problem-solving will only work if planners succeed in coordinating their problem repr esentations, their inference processes, and the final results they gain. Visualizing the analytic and reasoning processes could benefit the collaborators to have coherent representa tions, focused awareness, and consistent, accurate evaluation of the solution [6]. Interactive visualization, especially, allo ws users editing and exploring their own interested information with various perspectives based on individual collaborators X  responsibilities. For the purpose of collaboration, the visualized data can be immediate, intermediate, or final results in individual decision process, which is exchangeable between collaborators. Emergency management organizes resources and responsibility across different locations to d eal with emergency situations. Most of the emergency manage ment planning, if not all, involves geospatial information that can be located on maps. Thus, we assert that emergenc y management and planning is also a collaborative spatial decision making problem. Research suggests that Geography Inform ation Systems (GIS) can help decision making in emergency management [e.g. 7, 8]. However, these GIS related res earch focuses more on generating geographic information, rather than supporting the integration of spatial information to augment collaborative sensemaking and group decision making. Also, the accessibility and usability of
