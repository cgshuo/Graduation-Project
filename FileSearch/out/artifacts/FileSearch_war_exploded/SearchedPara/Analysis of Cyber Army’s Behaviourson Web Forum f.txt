 Referencing public opinions disseminated on the web to make decisions is very common customers usually consult the experiences about the possible candidates. Due to the in fl uence and usefulness of opinions, how to collect, classify, and summarize opinions from heterogeneous sources is indispensable. On the other hand, opinion spammers, who deceptions, fakes and disinformation. Thus how to identify the misleading information and the information providers becomes another issue.
 In elect campaign, camps employ various tools and methods to convince voters to in fl uenced voters on Twitter, Facebook and other social tools. On the other hand, cyber army hired by unscrupulous camps aim at extolling speci fi fake postings to mislead voters and in fl uence the electoral process and outcome. Recently, various approaches have been proposed to detect opinion spams and spammers [ 1 ]. However, researches are few on political domain such as elect campaign. Opinion spam/spammer detection is challenging from two aspects. Firstly, spam when the spam postings and spammers are recognized. Secondly, the opinion spam opinion spammers. Fortunately, two opinion spam corpora are disclosed recently. One is 2014 Taipei mayoral race, and the other one is 2013 Samsung Taiwan The former happened in the Gossip Forum on the Professional Technology Temple (PTT), Taiwan  X  s largest online bulletin board, which contains over 20,000 boards covering a multitude of topics. PTT has more than 1.5 million registered users with over 150,000 users online during peak hours and is similar to Reddit in America. A group of cyber army working for one camp in the Taipei mayoral race are disclosed. The latter happened in Mobile01, a web forum in Taiwan, where mobile phones, handheld devices and other consumer electronics are discussed. This paper focuses on the analysis of cyber army  X  s behaviors in the Gossip Forum on PTT. fi ndings from the dataset. Section 5 concludes the remarks. Tumasjan et al. [ 2 ] analyze over 100,000 Twitter messages mentioning parties or politicians prior to the German federal election 2009 using LIWC text analysis soft-political opinion, and is indeed used as a platform for political deliberation. detection is formulated as a classi fi cation problem. Experimental data are product reviews selected from Amazon. Duplicates or near-duplicates are regarded as fake reviews. Li et al. [ 4 ] detect campaign promoters on twitter with Markov Random Fields. Chen and Chen [ 1 , 5 ] investigate opinion spam and spammer detection on a web forum. The event of Samsung Taiwan over fake web reviews is adopted as a real case study. mayoral race. There are 2 major competitors, abbreviated as SL and KP, in this race. SL  X  s camp hired some cyber army to promote SL or criticize KP on PTT implicitly. It September 16th, a spokesman claimed he owned SL  X  sof fi cial account and wanted to communicate with users on PTT. Some keen users launched a cyber-manhunt via IP address of a disclosed account, and discovered other 20 accounts sharing some speci IP addresses with the spokesman. Total 14 of these related accounts posted unusual number of articles from mid-August to mid-September. This research focuses on the operations of these 14 accounts on PTT. 3.1 PTT Corpus An article has one main content written by an author and several comments from other or 3 sentences in at most 30 Chinese characters. PTT provides an article rating mechanism: commendation and criticism. When commenting an article, users can ahs  X  (  X  ) (subtracting a point), or an arrow (being neutral). Cyber army posted articles on Gossip Forum from August 18th until they were busted on September 16th. We scraped all the posts from Gossip Forum within this period. Total 49,740 articles and 1,454,994 comments were collected. Tables 1 and 2 show attributes of an article and a comment, respectively. 3.2 Treatment Group During the period, there are 10,242 users who posted at least one article and 59,200 users who posted at least one comment, but most of them do not active as cyber army. We decide to select active users by measuring activeness of a user, where the account of cyber army posted at least 18 articles, so we select another 647 users who posted at least 18 articles as our treatment group during the period. The numbers of articles/comments by cyber army and treatment group are 644/293 and 22,569/146,829, discussion. Most normal users in treatment group just passively give comments to posted articles.
 3.3 User Posts History and Pro fi le The number of articles on sub-forum is restricted by PTT system. During the scheduled maintenance, system deletes old articles exceeding the limit. A website, ucptt.com, backs up many hot sub forums on PTT. We scraped post history of the 661 users, including cyber army and treatment group, from ucptt.com. In addition, we scraped pro fi les of the 661 users. army do. Their main goal is to attract young voters. However, it is not easy to gain many acid remarks or even be harassed by others. Therefore, pretending to be one of common users is an important issue. We show how cyber army deal with it implicitly and are not noticed by other users. 4.1 Unusual Number of Articles in Gossip Forum Recall KP and SL denote the candidates denounced and promoted by cyber army, respectively. The sign of posting unusual number of articles can be discovered by the user history. These 14 accounts of cyber army did not post any articles from May to fi rst half of August. But from August 18th to September 16th, they posted unusual least one article before August. 4.2 Working Time of Cyber Army Figure 1 shows the submission time of articles and comments by cyber army (CA) and on the forum, i.e., cyber army are at work, while treatment group are at leisure. 4.3 Subtlety of Cyber Army KP and SL denote the candidates denounced and promoted by cyber army, respectively. (1) NR: posts not related to election. (2) SL+: posts related to election, and favor SL. (3) SL  X  : posts related to election, and disfavor SL. (4) KP+: posts related to election, and favor KP. (5) KP  X  : post related to election, and disfavor KP. (6) 3rd: post related to election, and favor the 3rd candidate. (7) NEU: post related to election without any favor.
 Most articles by cyber army are not related to the mayoral race. Portion of the race 10.3 %). Figure 2 shows the distribution of types of race articles by cyber army. An article may belong to more than one type, e.g., SL+ and KP that 74.29 % favor SL and disfavor KP, 18.57 % are neutral, 5.71 % favor the 3rd candidate, and 1.43 % favor KP. 4.4 Interaction Among Cyber Army and the Others Figure 3 shows the distribution of comments by cyber army to all the articles. They interact more with cyber army group themselves than the others. Besides, they like articles of types SL+ and KP  X  , and dislike articles of types SL words, cyber army promote their supporting candidate, and denounce the opponent through the article rating mechanism on PTT.
 This paper analyzes the operations of a special type of opinion spammers, cyber army in elect campaign. Unusual number of submission within a race period, working time, and group behaviors in political opinion spams are similar with those of product opinion spams. However, their sentiment words are different. Political opinions are quite related to the events happening in burst in elect campaign. We will extend the dataset and employ the fi ndings to cyber army detection in the future.
