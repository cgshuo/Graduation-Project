 Despite the importance of individuals coming together for social group-activities (e.g. pick-up volley ball, chess clubs), the process by which such groups coalesce is poorly understood. Existing theories focus on adoption and c ontribution rates, group types, and the formation of group norms , as opposed to the processes literature through an interview study examining: 1) how well people's needs for social group activ ity engagement are being met; 2) the challenges they face in finding and participating in, and; 3) leading interest-based group activities. Our findings highlight how people X  X  needs are not being addressed by current technologies. In particular, they place a heavy burden on individuals to step forward into leadership positions where the return they will We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of interest-based group coalescing technology.

The extent to which the widespread use and adoption of social participation observed by Putnam is unclear [29], [30]. People are the Internet the most, also visit friends and family face-to-face the numerous existing systems aim to help people move from online discovery to offline social events. For example, Meetup.com evidence that these systems are effectively addressing the needs of people and the communities they inhabit to engage with others. college campuses where it is likely that there are actually a significant number of other like-minded individuals with similar interests in geographic proximity [26], [41]. Clearly, in many environments the current stat e of affairs is suboptimal. group activity; 2) knowledge of others with whom that interest is discovery by the interested peop le; 5) one or more individuals who are willing and able to perform a leadership role to organize the group activities; and 6) a criti cal mass of individuals deciding to socially engage in a particular activity group. At present, there is a significant gap in our knowle dge regarding how these factors are conducive for participation. The process of group coalescence is poorly understood, and many after they have been formed. There is limited understanding of the relationship between people's inte rests and the challenges they they are finding interest-based activity groups, and where they are opportunities to participate in inte rest-based group activities. Such environments are good pla ces to explore group coalescing thanks to the high number of i ndividuals in geographic proximity, for fun X  [34]. If any environm ent and associated population is social media to facilit ate participating in gr oup activities it is that of urban U.S. college campuses. In the remainder of this paper, we first review foundational concepts and theories that frame this research, including social capital, group coalescence, criti cal mass, pluralistic ignorance, and event-based social networks . Research questions and method lead into findings, which are organized according to themes extracted from interviews. We c onclude with discussion of these findings, design considerations, limitations, and future research plans. This section begins by explaining what social capital is and why it groups are and our current understanding of how groups form. described, as they relate to the conditions necessary for the formation of activity-based groups that could help members build form groups that meet offline. Social capital refers to the individual and collective benefits accumulated through social networks or social structures [9], [32]. etc.) by using one X  X  social-ties or  X  X onnections X . These can lead to engagements. People gain social capital through interactions with each other and developing strong ties (building upon established has been linked to a variety of positive community outcomes (e.g. better public health, lower crime rates, and more ef fi cient fi nancial markets) [1], [18]. Also, on an i ndividual level, social capital has been found to be related to posi tive psychological well-being (e.g. higher self esteem and satisfaction with life) [5], [16]. Putnam X  X  cumulative research sugge sted social capital decreased during the course of the twentiet h century [32]. The argument laid out that people have been participating in less social activities and social clubs with each other, including participating in community service, turning to their checkbooks as service instead. Since then, research has investigated the effects of social media on social [24], virtual worlds, video games) . Lampe and Ellison, in studying college students X  use of Facebook, have discovered that Facebook is used more for maintaining of fline contacts by bringing them online (becoming Facebook  X  X riends X ), rather than for creating new contacts [21]. People who use Facebook the most for social interaction also tend to visit friends and family less [36]. It is clear people are using new social tools to come together face-to-face but the extent to which new technologies have reversed the decline is unclear. A group is colloquially understood to be a cluster of two or more Categorization Theory (SCT) [40] indicates that social groups are defined through a process of classifi cation of the self  X  individuals identify with a group that matches his or her view (in-group), and reinforce this identity partly through excluding themselves from groups they have no affinity for (out-groups) [3]. Over time, these social groups develop  X  X roup norms X  that consist of goals and behaviors (e.g. actions/discussion topics) that are part of the group [37]. These norms also create boundaries between the in-and out-groups, describing what is and is not acceptable to the group. For example, the individuals playing pick-up basketball together can playing styles, etc.). Social groups can emerge not only as a result activity, but also because the individuals come to recognize mutual friendships, family or work ties. Social groups are often categorized as bond-based or identity-connected with the individuals within the group more so than with the whole group itself. These groups typically do not have a specific shared activity centric goal. For example, Fraternity members are  X  X rothers X  and create life-long friendships with each other. Unlike bond-based groups , interest-based activity groups can generally be considered  X  X de ntity-based X . Individuals care For example, members of a pick-up basketball group will change over time, but the group will continue to exist. The group survives no matter who is a member, and if one individual leaves, there is not necessarily a mass exodus of players. So me interest-based friends, and would be considered more bond-based, as they are on nature of the groups that do exist, but on the challenges faced by individuals wishing to participate in group activities. group development, Tuckman X  X  Stages of Group Development the emergence of new social groups. By this we mean social groups that result from free associa tion and shared participation in an interest-based group activity. The research in this paper is focused on participation in interest-based group activities, and the Tuckman X  X  Stages of Group Development model can be used to reflect on the group activity coalescing process. Tuckman X  X  model describes five stages: 1) forming, 2) storming, 3) norming, 4) model can be modified to expl ain the coalescing process of emergent social groups: 1) discovery, 2) introduction, and 3) membership. Tuckman X  X   X  X orming X  stage is an initial stage where dependence. Little is known about each other. This relates to awareness of each other X  X  existen ce. For example, two individuals who are independently practicing shooting hoops at a basketball court become aware of each other X  X  existence. The only Tuckman X  X   X  X torming X  stage is filled with conflict. At this stage, step where individuals reveal self-information to judge whether or two individuals begin to play  X  X ick-up X  basketball with each other, relationship (to play each other again) in the future. During Tuckman X  X   X  X orming X  phase, the collective forms a single goal, formation, this third step is where the group forms a membership, where individuals self-identify with others X  mutual goals/views to form mutual goals/views of the group. While interest-based group activities enable members to share capital through relationships. This is even more evident on college campuses where students can afford to build new social social networking. Based on the Theory of Collective Action, two conditions need to converge for a successful interest-based group result (e.g. online cat lover discussion community). If a collective inadequate cohort of members has been accrued, the group will have no chance of achieving its collective goal. The concept of  X  X ritical mass X  was used by Hiltz &amp; Turoff [17], to innovation so that the rate of adoption becomes self-sustaining idea or innovation is not only un likely to spread, but to be deserted altogether. Olson, in The Logic of Collective Action, small group of individuals (critical mass) who have the most majority. Since the critical mass are so interested, he argues, they will provide the good themselves, regardless of the actions of the contributing at all: they know they will get the good anyway, because the "great" will provide it [28]. Leaders/organizers of activity groups are part of the critical mass, and face the challenge flyers, providing equipment) to pu sh for activities to take place. individuals contribute the most resources initially, there is a scale or  X  X roduction function X  that others who are less interested do are free-riders [27]. Their theory states that once the critical mass attendance will rise from others w ho want to participate, but who are less interested (and therefore provide fewer resources than the critical mass). These less interested participants are of course necessary for a successful activity. Collective action goals are necessary for group members to collaborate towards success. Gold and Sugden's [15] observation that the theoretically challengi ng prisoner's dilemmas and other "public good" puzzles can be rationally and optimally solved by agents who adopt the "team reasoning" stance ("we should" rather than "I should") illuminates the ways in which membership ("we") and collective goals ("should") are intertwined for successful  X  X e-intentions X  [39]. We-intentions are specifically group-centric goals that everyone involved agrees to accomplish with the same motive. members willing to put forth the effort and a shared goal to members needed for an emergent group are not found. The problem that needs to be solved is to help interested people in holding the social attitudes and expectations they do, all expectations are unshared and th e unfounded assumption that they are uniformly shared X  [25]. Latan X  and Darley [23] suggested they do not need to act or react under the assumption that group activities such as a sport or music. Here though we are not only interested a general belief that others share an activity identified. Over the past few years Event-based Social Networks (EBSN), have become increasingly popular [ 24]. Examples of such systems (www.Plancast.com) and Eventbrite (www.EventBrite.com). They provide an online platform for users to create, distribute and organize social events, which are generally face-to-face. Research engagement through recommending individuals to events or public event-focused groups through an analysis of a profile of user X  X  interests, user social-ties, and co-presence data [4], [8]. Commercial EBSB applications generally adopt one of three commercial models  X  pay for the ability to lead/organize groups commercial venues through advertising and getting users to make Each of these models pushes th e support focus towards social structures where there is 1) a main organizer of an activity (leader) who is willing to make significant investment to actualize the real world, many social group-activities are less structured and Consequently, a motivation for th is research was to see if a paradigm shift for EBSNs away from their current focus on affinities X  would be of value. As noted in our background section existing theories focus on social group-activities in terms of adoption/membership and initial group coalescence. To addre ss this concern we explore the following broad research questions focusing specifically on our exemplar campus: RQ1: How do individuals perceive their needs for social group activity engagement are being met? RQ2: What challenges do individuals face in regards to searching for, participating in, and leading interest-based group activities? RQ3: How does technology impact the process of coalescing social group activity? interview study on an urban school campus of a technological university with approximately 10,000 students. Students were randomly approached in locations of the university known for contexts, locations, and times of day, we conducted interviews in 16 unique locations (e.g. gym, basketball court, game room, racquet ball court, hallways of bu ildings with classrooms, student lounges, cafeteria, outdoor lawns, coffee shop) between 11am and 6:30pm on weekdays. Two types of locations were targeted: 1) hanging out in the student lounge). When approached, interview res pondents were first asked about their current activity and then ou r semi-structured interview guide was used to obtain data on other activities they were involved in, how they gathered information about activities they participate in, these activities. Summaries of each interview with key insights on conducted. Early versions of th e interview guide focused on challenges in finding, participati ng in, and sustaining participation recorded for transcription and further analysis. The summaries created for each interview highlighted several themes. Interviews were then transcribed for coding. The initial coding was informed by the trends found in the summaries of each interview, followed by an iterative open coding process that was used to enable the discovery of emergent themes [6]. Once coding was complete, quotes were extracted from the transcripts for evidence of each theme X  X  existence. Interview data were collected fro m a total of 60 respondents (23% female  X  approximating the student population distribution) were undergraduates and belonge d to engineering (34%) or computer science (30%) fields while the rest were from a range of disciplines such as math, science, architecture, and management. 15 minutes each. The following themes emerged from our interviews: Students use a  X  X atisficing X  strategy in order to find the  X  X ext best thing X  so they can socialize and make friends. They typically experimented by joining at leas t one club on campus, but that club often did not relate directly to an important personal interest. 2) Information Not Getting to Ta rget Audience: Current methods of communicating and advertising upcoming events are ineffective and not reaching the intended audience. Signs advertising events hung around campus are often ignored by Electronic means of advertising (e.g. Facebook invites, online overburdened by too many irrele vant invites, people tend to ignore them all and miss poten tially relevant invites. 3) Burden of Leadership: There is a burden of leadership that prevents interest-based activities from occurring and interest-daunting, and is a major deterrence to most individuals. Below we explain and illustrate these themes in more detail. Our respondents typically mentioned four to five primary interests (e.g. comics, gaming), but on furt her probing also mentioned one pursued secondary interests if they had  X  X xtra time. X  For example, one graduate student enjoyed t echnology news and played team basketball  X  only if others invited her. While she has been a played basketball on campus. Respondents reported joining at least one club on campus, however the clubs joined were not them to socialize. A common sentiment expressed by most respondents was that they felt they were missing out on activities related to their previous bad experiences keep respondents away from pursuing activities of interest. Responde nts mentioned it is not easily group-activities together. Respondents often had unfulfilled wish es to participate in specific interests because the people th ey knew did not share similar interests. Anthony, a 21-year-old male CS student, mentioned that he liked to party, but  X  X y friends don't like to party. I want to go but I don X  X  really want to go by myself and I don X  X  know where to many respondents. Jenny, a 20-year-old female biology student said,  X  X  want to take an airplane lesson, and go to a gun club. But my friends don X  X  like this. They aren X  X  interested; they don X  X  want to go [...] I want them to go with me. I won X  X  do it by myself. X  Respondents shared a desire to find a club that consisted of members who share their interest. They reported that often no such club existed. John, an 18-year-old male IT student, said,  X  X e there was a snowboarder club. They said  X  X o. X  It was a joke at the female architecture student, said,  X  X y friends have no interest in what I want to do. I want a club that shows my interest and people who share my interest. People I can have conversations with. X  Some interviewees reported that with school and/or work, their load was too full for many activities they wanted to participate in. Neal, an 18-year-old male CS student, said ,  X  X f I had more time I would be in more clubs. Originally I was in three clubs but I was time right now. X  Others exclaimed that they did not have enough time to join a club. Julius, a 22-year-old male CS student, said,  X  X  just don X  X  have time. I heard about the TED talks recently. Which because I don X  X  have enough time. X  James, a 21-year-old male civil engineering student, expr essed a similar sentiment,  X  X ike work to do so I need to work instead. X  Ben, an 18-year-old male now...just trying to survive through the semester. I actually joined about my schedule so I don X  X  par ticipate in any clubs now. X  Respondents became frustrated with clubs that participated in turned off by what they saw. Shawn, an 18-year-old male biology student, mentioned his experience with the anime club,  X  X  went to really do anything. I walked in and people were playing Magic [the card game]. X  A similar problem happened to Kevin, a 19-sat there and realized they only watched anime. X  Bad experiences also affect res pondents X  motivation to participate civil engineering student, complained about a Frisbee group, They would only throw it to people they knew. X  Anne, an 18-year-old female biology student , felt more comfortable playing basketball with her friends than w ith strangers in a pick-up game. She said,  X  X t is usually a group of boys at the gym, because girls experiences, both respondents repor ted being reluctant to join pick-up games in their respective sports. and near elevators (Figure 1), respondents reported not being able to gather information relevant to them. Respondent s gave reasons female architecture student, revealed, "I've seen fliers everywhere. way to somewhere." Ben, a 21-year-old male biomedical engineering student, agreed, "I can choose to read them, or I can continue on my day. I'd rather not waste my time." The main reason for respondents ignoring these signs was information overload  X  there were too many si gns about activities not relevant to their interests. Current technological solutions we re also ineffective. Students used Facebook invites for activities, but as Sam, a 20-year-old but that gets annoying. Most of the time its stuff I have no interest in. I end up ignoring things I would be interested in. X  When asked about using Meetup.com, all responde nts gave a similar answer as hearing about meetup.com X  Students did not know about or use Sam, a 20-year-old female architecture student, wished, "I feel like there should be a better way to communicate. I feel that other campuses have some kind of Facebook." While respondents were aware of the university electronic calendar, they said did not find much use for it. Jillian, a 19-year-old female architecture student, said,  X  X ou finally get to the calendar and it is listed in a way that is not intuitive. [...] A well-mentioned the University Facebook app, which was not a very messages asking about activities do not receive useful or accurate replies. for an interest if it did not already exist. They expected the task to know many others with the same interest. Shawn, an 18-year-old that someone else would initiate it, not me. It's too much effort. X  The process for becoming a sanctioned club at the University constitution with club rules, and announcing/planning four events outside of a weekly meeting. John, an 18-year-old male IT explained how he gave up after findi ng that it was too much effort because we had a president, secr etary, treasurer, the positions you need for the club. So we needed 10 people. It was 4 of us, we needed 6 other people. Within a week we had 40 people who said they were interested in joining the snowboard club. The main problem was no one followed th rough. I gave everyone many chances to give me an application, even made it downloadable other person. So, based on all that, it didn't go well. X  Groups that started small had issu es with continued membership factor in weaning enthusiasm among group leaders. Jimmy, a 21-campus. We got together and played, and just talking too. I think the organizers were hoping more people would come. After the first couple meetings we stopped getting new people and they fell apart. X  This interview study sought to gain an understanding of the extent to which college students were participating in activities related to their interests in the current technological environment. In so doing, we discovered the challenges they face and factors that group activities. Many definitions of  X  X ommunity X  exist [19], here we consider having a particular characteristic in common. Local communities campuses are akin to residential communities, residents move in with little to no knowledge of the other inhabitants, and waves of people enter, exit, and interact da ily, nightly, and weekly. College campuses are unique in that 18-22 year olds usually populate them, and the residents are primarily students. While we believe research is clearly needed to confirm this conjecture. Our study shows that students X  social needs are not being met interests and the types of group activities they would like to participate in, and their level of involvement in such activities on engagement became i mmediately apparent. The main reason for organizations/clubs fo r those interests. While one would expect a small campus community to be close and tight knit we found that college students found it very hard to friends were not interested in but did not know others who shared their interests, and did not have a way to find them. Students only find out about others X  interest s after meeting them. Having no system that gives students the ability to seek and find others based interest-based group activities. This finding is further corroborated were not aware of others with those shared interests. For example, participated with a dance group. The college community under study boasts of a  X  X lub culture X  where groups form school-sanctioned clubs based on interests. However there is mismatch between what students want and what beginning of each semester, where clubs occupy booths to recruit new members. Many respondents mentioned finding a club they were interested in at the club fair, making this an easy method for socialize.

T  X  X ick-u difficu l Our examination of the challenges faced by students wishing to participate in social group-activi ties provides us with new insights optimal. In an ideal world, inte rest-based activity group formation would be optimized in such a way that every person is satisfied by the quality and quantity of groups they participate in. Every person would participate in the op timum number of interest-based there would be a balance between individual and community needs, with a community also having the optimum number of activities occurring at any given ti me with the optimum number of For example, if a person was interested in both playing volleyball and "arts and crafts", and 9 others were willing to play volleyball right now, but only one person was willing to craft, a system taking into account both community and individual needs would recommend the volleyball activity to the 10 willing individuals. Gale and Shapley shared the Nobel Prize in Economics for their work on Stable Market Theory [14], developing an algorithm that would be better [13]. If we re -conceptualize community based then we can use the notion of  X  X table Markets X  to understand the extent to which the current situation is far from the optimal. Unfortunately, we cannot simply apply Gale and Shapley X  X  solutions to activity markets beca use 1) coalescing groups is more complex than pairs; 2) communities are dynamic, people enter and leave often (e.g. commuters come to campus for a certain number of hours per day); and 3) there are unknown variables (e.g. every member's interests, availability, and willingness to participate. operates. This more holistic interpretation of coalescing challenges leads us availability of willing participants (the activity marketplace). This information; and 2) a reduction in the burden and risks associated information would be available regarding the pool of potential participations and how to reac h them. Of course, capturing the overall real-time participatory interest levels of members of a community is not an easy task. Research must be conducted to understand how user search behavior can reflect their interests and level of willingness to find ot hers who share that interest. One major issue that survey respondents brought up was the difficulty in finding others who sh are interests. Currently, interest-based group activity systems have a similar pr oblem. Systems wait for an individual to create a group, then use keywords in the group description to recommend the group to individuals who share that interest. Having a databa se of individuals X  interests has communication between these indi viduals, they could discuss forum/chat room or simply the option to send a message to the individuals  X  e.g. there are five others who like anime. Why don X  X  you start a group for anime? X  Showing that other individuals have increases the possibility that one person will step forward to start a new group. Putting a group together may create the immediate critical mass of interested individuals needed to form a new group. achieve this we adopted a semi-s tructured interview method that interviews were powerful means of gathering insight into the context of wants and needs of the community, but the small sample cannot indicate the number of people who share interests across the entire community. The community that was studied is of a very specific type  X  a college campus community. While we believe the similarity between members of the college campus and generalizability, we need furthe r research on people X  X  interest-generalizable. A natural extension of this work is to consider the use of study that focuses on users of Meetup.com , and specifically, looking at organizers and their attempts (failed and successful) to create Meetup groups on specific activities. From this, we will continue the research by using quantitative methods to understand how current coalescing methods affect samples of both the university an d Meetup.com populations in an problems people face in becomi ng leaders and an understanding future applications. This paper presents findings of an interview study that focused on the interests and activities of college students. These results represent a first step towards understanding the coalescing process towards a need to better understand the coalescing process in small communities in order to build better systems to support successful coalescing for interest-based group activities.
