 As research includes more and larger user studies, a significant problem lies in combining the many types of data files into a single table suitable for analysis by common statistical tools. We have developed a data-aggrega tion tool that combines user logs, expert scoring, and task/s ession attributes. The tool also integrates the n-grams derived from a given sequence of actions in the user tasks. The tool provides a GUI for quick and easy configuration. H.5.2 [ Information Interfaces and Presentation ]: User Interfaces  X  evaluation/methodology, prototyping Measurement, Experimentation, Human Factors, Standardization User studies, data analysis, data aggregation, n-gram analysis. Combining myriad data sources into a coherent, analyzable set is a non-trivial feat. User logs reco rd multiple simultaneous events, expert scoring defines a  X  X olden set X  of correct answers for task problems, and the assigned tasks need to be differentiated by their attributes. We see the goal of data aggregation as combining these factors into a single table prior to correlational analysis. By contrast, the best-known aggreg ation tools are of a different scope and character. The qualitative Nvivo package [1] allows users to tag, annotate and link te xt, video, and sound data in a drag-and-drop interface; the data can thereafter be explored using search and query engines. Similarly, the ATLAS.ti package [2] lets users label and search th rough complex phenomena hidden in text and multimedia. N-grams of user activity streams may contain interesting behaviour patterns that can be tie d to successful and unsuccessful task performance. To date, studies using n-grams have limited the n-gram lengths: both [3] and [4] limited n-grams to 5 or 6 symbols in length. One goal of our tool is to allow researchers to generate easily all n-grams in a range of desired lengths, for finding correlations of user-acti on patterns to task attributes. The tool currently supports input and output file types in comma-and tab-separated value (CSV, TSV), and Excel formats.
