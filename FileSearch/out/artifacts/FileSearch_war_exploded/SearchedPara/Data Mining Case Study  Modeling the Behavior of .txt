This paper looks at the use of a Self Organizing Map (SOM), to link of records of crimes of serious sexual attacks. Once linked a profile can be derived of the offender(s) responsible. The data was drawn from the major crimes database at the National Crime Faculty of the National Police Staff College 
Bramshill UK. The data was encoded from text by a small team of specialists working to a well-defined protocol. The encoded data was analyzed using SOMs. Two exercises were conducted. 
These resulted in the linking of several offences in to clusters each of which were sufficiently similar to have possibly been committed by the same offender(s). A number of clusters were used to form profiles of offenders. Some of these profiles were confirmed by independent analysts as either belonging to known offenders or appeared sufficiently interesting to warrant further investigation. 
The prototype was developed over 10 weeks. This contrasts with an in-house study using a conventional approach, which took 2 years to reach similar results. As a consequence of this study the NCF intends to pursue an in-depth follow up study.

Copyright ACM 2001 1-58113-391-x/01/08...$5.00 When a specified offence occurs within the United Kingdom (UK) the Force in which the offence occurred has the remit to forward full details to the NCF for subsequent entry onto the ViCLASS system. A specified offence includes a sexually motivated murder, rape where the offender is a stranger or only has limited knowledge of the victim, abduction for sexual purposes and serious indecent assaults. ViCLASS is a relational database developed in 1991 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police comprising 53 tables not all of which are used in the UK. The system not only stores hard factual information relating to the crime but the offender's behavior is also encoded. Trained analysts examine a 165 question input document and extract behavioral information from narrative text such as the offender's speech and physical actions immediately prior to and during the commission of the crime. On receipt of the document an Analyst Assistant uses a quality control document for guidance to ensure a consistent approach to data interpretation. It is the role of the NCF Analysts to examine each new case, the index case, with a view to identifying similarities with existing offences within the system. If such links series of crimes committed by the same offender(s) who may or may not be known. If a specific series cannot be identified, the analysis may still reveal similarities with other crimes that will assist the Senior Investigating Officer in the investigation of the index crime. Current Police crime recording systems do not transcend individual Police Force boundaries, therefore, those crimes that occur in different Force areas are more difficult to detect. It is within the NCF remit to provide additional assistance in these circumstances. A copy of the database used in this study contained 2370 recorded sexual offences that occurred throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland between March 1998 and June 2000 and were referred to NCF for analysis. Table 1 shows the eight specific crime categories and the numbers of offences associated with each. The categories are not mutually exclusive, an example being an offender who commits a burglary with a view to sexually assaulting the victim. Total 22 138 1786 223 230 306 339 266 3310 237C There are 1015 known offenders (convicted, charged or suspected) 90 of whom are believed to have committed 2 or more offences. illustrates an example of confusing encoding of free text information. In this example the variable being encoded relates to whether the victim was specifically targeted as an individual (not both the Yes and No contain the same information and all should have been encoded as No. 
The intention of the group involved in this offence was to pick up a prostitute -so to that extent she was targeted. 
In that she was a prostitute The offender did not target however it need not have that particular prostitute. been specifically her. 
As being a vulnerable Only in as much as she was a female single, young, vulnerable 
It is not uncommon for the encoded data to have fields that contain unknown or missing values. There are a variety of legitimate reasons why this can happen. In this specific task one such occurrence might be due to the victim not recalling certain facts due to the trauma associated with the crime. How should they be treated? Are those fields essential to the mining process? 
There are a number of methods [12] for treating records that contain missing values: -1. Omit the incorrect field(s) 2. Omit the entire record that contains the incorrect field(s) 3. Automatically enter/correct the data with default values e.g. 4. Derive a model to enter/correct the data 5. Replace all values with a global constant 
Within this study both missing and unknown data have been set to zero when used in dichotomous variables. 
Data was encoded as either 1 of n or binary dichotomous variables. Categorical data was encoded by sets of mutually exclusive binary variables. An example being the offender's build which was encoded as one of: Unknown, 
Thin/Skinny/Slim, Medium, Heavy/Stock/Fat being encoded as four binary variables with one variable set to one and the remainder to zero. 
Three of the data fields each contain a large number of options, some of which appear to be "close" in meaning :-
Figure 1, illustrates the 2D representation of the resulting modeling process for Exercise I. The map shows the 2370 crimes show density. Whilst there is a degree of variability in terms of how approach types, con, surprise and blitz, have been distributed they do appear to fall in to three broad regions. Lines have been manually drawn on the graph to show these region,,;. 
Figure 2, illustrates the 2D representation of the resulting modeling process for exercise 2 on a 10 by 10 grid (100 cells). 
Again individual crimes lying within a cell have been agitated to show density. 
There are fewer crimes in this model as the geographical region was restricted to encompass a single police area. Again lines have been manually drawn to broadly separate the differing types of approach that the offender used at the point of contact with the victim. 
The triangle contains fifty four crimes belonging to a super-cluster that were selected for independent verification. The particularly dense clusters at the top of the SOM have occurred due to missing data rather than a well-defined behavioral pattern. This illustrates the effect missing data can have on the modeling process. 
NCF analysts who took no part in the modeling undertook the verification process but due to their workload they could not examine all crimes within all clusters. Each analyst was only presented with a list of crime identification numbers, with a remit to ascertain whether there were similarities between the crimes, they had no other information. The narrative (discussed in 
Section 2) was mainly used to ascertain the similarities between the crimes. 
Three clusters represented by the squares in Figure 1 above were sent for independent verification. In exercise 1 the initial clustering process used the Approach and Verbal themes variables and it was established that there were additional similarities between the crimes contained in each cluster. 
The similarities in cluster 1 consisted of the following: - X  80% of the victims were under the influence of alcohol  X  The type of sexual assault was 100% consistent  X  Precautions were taken by the offender in 80% of crimes  X  Although the offender immediately overpowered the victim 
The similarities in cluster 2 consisted of the following: - X  50% of the offenders were of the same non-white race  X  53% of the victims were walking in public places at the time  X  A further 33% of victims were asleep at the time of the  X  There were 2 partial series contained within this cluster  X  4 crimes were part of a known series 
The similarities in cluster 3 consisted of the following: - X  The victim was subjected to a number of sexual acts in  X  100% of the offenders took precautions  X  In 100% of the crimes the offender disrobed himself as well 
Of the three clusters submitted for validation, cluster 2 contained the largest number of offenders and cluster 3 the fewest. It would appear that the number of crimes contained within the clusters indicate the accuracy of the clustering process; the fewer the crimes in the resulting clusters, the more similarities there appear to be. 
The three clusters bounded by squares in figure 1 were also examined using extra variables shown in table 4 together with a 'control group' formed by Monte Carlo simulation. The purpose of the control group is to provide a description of a "typical" sexual offence in the belief that variations from typicality could indicate significant behavioral characteristics. The headings in table 4 refer to the attributes in the database tables, for example 'Questions' refers to whether the offender questioned the victim. Given the limitations identified in Section 3 the results are encouraging. In both exercises, based on the results of the verification process, there is some evidence that the models identify consistency in offender behavior. The analysts established that crimes in individual clusters exhibited strong similarities, with adjacent clusters that are based on a variable theme having similar traits as illustrated in Figure 2. An analyst currently compares the index case against the remainder of the database by selecting one or more variahles from the screen, which is then translated into a SQL query. This a time consuming process of multiple queries returning different overlapping sets in order to ensure that all variances are returned for examination. In both exercises, the analysts report that all crimes that they would have wished to examine were contained within the clusters. The results from Exercise 1 demonstrate that crimes within a single cluster have strong similarities and, as in theresults from cluster 2, may even contain crimes that have been committed by the same offender. With further refinements it should be possible to suggest names from the known offender list as being responsible for, as yet, unsolved crimes. The results from Exercise 2 indicate that this type of model could be used as an initial match against the index case by restricting the search space to the Police Force area in which that crime occurred. A second pass through the data would include those crimes from the adjacent Force areas and a third pass could include national data. This prototype system took ten weeks to develop from being unfamiliar with the data and its structures, to gain domain understanding, encode and model the data and pass the results through a verification process. Prior to and independent of this study, three persons; a medical psychologist, a statistician and a researcher, took two years to complete a study that reached broadly similar results. As a result of this study the NCF plan to commence an in depth 12 month pilot using the software.  X  Only two sets of two variable types were used in this study.  X  Use several combinations of two variable sets and establish Our thanks to the National Crime Faculty of the National Police College Bramshill United Kingdom for providing the data and independent verification of the results.
