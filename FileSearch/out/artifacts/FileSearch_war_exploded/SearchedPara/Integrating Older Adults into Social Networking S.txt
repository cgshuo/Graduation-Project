 Social Networking sites (SNS) use helps teenagers and younger adults to increase their social ne twork and maintain those offline connections made in their daily activities. However older adults are often left aside from SNS, missing interaction opportunities with the members of their social network. The lack of participation and access to these social capital sources might be relevant because several studies indicate the impact that causes the quality of the social network in the physical and mental health of the older adult. Therefore the goal of my dissertation is to investigate the impact and issues raised by the use of ambient information systems to help older adults to socialize through SNSs in natural ways creating an ambient social network site H.5.m [ Information interfaces and presentation ]: Miscellaneous Ambient displays, social networ king sites, family attachment. Social ties and social integration often play a beneficial role for maintaining psychological well-be ing contributing to a better mental health of older adults . Strong social networks may enhance the quality of life of older adults improving their health [2], reducing the chances for developing cognitive decline [4] and eventually preventing an earlier d eath [5]. Older adults with poor or weak social networks are 60% more likely to develop cognitive decline due to isolation or high st ress levels caused by the loss of the spouse [8]. Also, socially active older adults are physically and mentally healthier in contrast with those who are isolated. On the other hand, nowadays SNSs have the potential of strengthening the social network of older adults. These sites are sources of social capital, provi ding social or emotional support and access to information resources [6]. However these services are limited to less technical users such as older adults, who might be losing the opportunity to strength their social network. we will conduct a set of interviews to capture design and usability issues. During this phase the ambient social devices will be removed from the older adults X  homes and on phase four a last set of interviews will be conducted to capture issues regardless the impact of the removal of the ambient social devices. The development of the digital frame was motivated from the findings gather from a four months follow up with older adults in two conditions: (1) older adults w ith cognitive decline living in a nursing home and (2) older adults living with relatives or independently. We found that one of the biggest barriers in maintaining strong emotional ties is that elders are disassociated with events related to their rela tives X  everyday life. Therefore the digital frame was designed to inte grate non-computer older adults into their family X  X  SNS, pr oviding them everyday knowledge about their relatives X  life lightwe ight information (photographs and personal messages) (ePortrait architecture in [1]). We found out that the elder changed her pathways and routines to include in her daily routine the activity of viewing the photos every morning for around a half an hour. Also the ePortrait acted as a communication enhancer by providing the elder awareness of the family activities which resulted in new topics of conversation. Similar studies explored situated di splays to keep elders in touch with people they care about. For example the PersondCards [7] is a digital frame dedicated to a single older adult X  X  relative. Nevertheless this prototype allows lightweight information (e.g. pictures) to be sent through diffe rent channels of communication, sending content represents an extra effort for the family members. Also it is a fixed channel representing one family member not supporting the whole social network of the older adult. Similarly, the Sharing the Day X  X  events [3] sends pictures, drawings or videos to a fixed screen in the ol der adult X  X  home. This project is similar to the ePortrait; however our project uses information already shared in the online community to keep the elder informed of her family X  X  events. Of these, only the Epigraph was a working prototype, and none was evaluated in situ for extensive periods of time. The knowledge gathered from the study provides a scheme to understand patterns of communi cations and pathways and routines on a SNS. I will extend such study to understand social support perceived by the 100 older adults and the characteristics of smaller representative sample. This research will contribute to
