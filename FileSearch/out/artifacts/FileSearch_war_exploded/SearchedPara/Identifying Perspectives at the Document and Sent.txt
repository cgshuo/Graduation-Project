 In this paper we investigate the problem of auto-matically identifying the perspective from which a document was written. By perspective, we mean  X  X ubjective evaluation of relative significance, a point-of-view. X  For example, documents about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict may appear to be about the same topic, but reveal different perspectives: (1) The inadvertent killing by Israeli forces of (2) In the first weeks of the Intifada, for example, Example 1 is written from a Israeli perspective; Ex-ample 2 is written from a Palestinian perspective . We aim to address a research question: can comput-ers learn to identify the perspective of a document given a training corpus of documents that are writ-ten from different perspectives?
When an issue is discussed from different per-spectives, not every sentence in a document strongly reflects the perspective the author possesses. For ex-ample, the following sentences are written by one Palestinian and one Israeli: (3) The Rhodes agreements of 1949 set them as (4) The green line was drawn up at the Rhodes Example 3 and 4 both factually introduce the back-ground of the issue of the  X  X reen line X  without expressing explicit perspectives. Can computers automatically discriminate between sentences that strongly express a perspective and sentences that only reflect shared background information?
A system that can automatically identify the per-spective from which a document written will be a highly desirable tool for people analyzing huge col-lections of documents from different perspectives. An intelligence analyst regularly monitors the po-sitions that foreign countries take on political and diplomatic issues. A media analyst frequently sur-veys broadcast news, newspapers, and web blogs for different viewpoints. What these analysts need in common is that they would like to find evidence of strong statements of differing perspectives, while ig-noring statements without strong perspectives as less interesting.

In this paper we approach the problem of learning perspectives in a statistical learning framework. We develop statistical models to learn how perspectives are reflected in word usage, and evaluate the models by measuring how accurately they can predict the perspectives of unseen documents. Lacking anno-tation on how strongly individual sentences convey a particular perspective in our corpus poses a chal-lenge on learning sentence-level perspectives. We propose a novel statistical model, Latent Sentence Perspective Model, to address the problem. Identifying the perspective from which a document is written is a subtask in the growing area of auto-matic opinion recognition and extraction. Subjec-tive language is used to express opinions, emotions, and sentiments. So far research in automatic opinion recognition has primarily addressed learning sub-jective language (Wiebe et al., 2004; Riloff et al., 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), identifying opinion-ated documents (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Riloff et al., 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), and discriminat-ing between positive and negative language (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Turney and Littman, 2003; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Morinaga et al., 2002).

Although by its very nature we expect much of the language of presenting a perspective or point-of-view to be subjective, labeling a document or a sentence as subjective is not enough to identify the perspective from which it is written. Moreover, the ideology and beliefs authors possess are often ex-pressed in ways more than conspicuous positive or negative language toward specific targets. Our corpus consists of articles published on the bitterlemons website 1 . The website is set up to  X  X ontribute to mutual understanding [between Palestinians and Israels] through the open exchange of ideas X . Every week an issue about Israeli-Palestinian conflict is selected for discussion, for example,  X  X isengagement: unilateral or coordi-nated? X , and a Palestinian editor and an Israeli edi-tor contribute a article addressing the issue. In ad-dition, the Israeli and Palestinian editors invite or interview one Israeli and one Palestinian to express their views, resulting in a total of four articles in a weekly edition.

We evaluate the subjectivity of each sentence us-ing the patterns automatically extracted from foreign news documents (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), and find that 65.6% of Palestinian sentences and 66.2% of Is-raeli sentences are classified as subjective. The high but almost equivalent percentages of subjective sen-tences from two perspectives supports our observa-tion in Section 2 that perspective is largely expressed in subjective language but subjectivity ratio is not necessarily indicative of the perspective of a docu-ment. We approach the problem of learning perspectives in a statistical learning framework. Denote a training corpus as pairs of documents W tives labels D of documents in the corpus. Given a new document  X  W with a unknown document perspective  X  D , iden-tifying its perspective is to calculate the following conditional probability, We are interested in how strongly each sentence in the document convey perspective. Denote the inten-sity of the m -th sentence of the n -th document as a binary random variable S is the total number of sentences of the n -th docu-ment. Evaluating how strongly a sentence conveys a particular perspective is to calculate the following conditional probability, 4.1 Document Perspective Models The process of generating documents from a partic-ular perspective is modeled as follows, The model is known as na  X  X ve Bayes models (NB), which has been widely used for NLP tasks such as text categorization (Lewis, 1998). To calculate (5) under NB in a full Bayesian manner is, however, complicated, and alternatively we employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to simulate samples from the posterior distributions. 4.2 Latent Sentence Perspective Models We introduce a new binary random variables, S , to model how strongly a perspective is expressed at the sentence level. The value of S is either s 1 or s , where s 1 means the sentence is written strongly from a perspective, and s 0 is not. The whole gener-ative process is modeled as follows,  X  and  X  carry the same semantics as those in NB. S is naturally modeled as a binary variable, where  X  is the parameter of S and represents how likely a perspective is strongly expressed at the sentence given on the overall document perspective. We call this model Latent Sentence Perspective Models (LSPM), because S is never directly observed in ei-ther training or testing documents and need to be in-ferred. To calculate (6) under LSPM is difficult. We again resort to MCMC methods to simulate samples from the posterior distributions. 5.1 Identifying Perspectives at the Document To objectively evaluate how well na  X  X ve Bayes mod-els (NB) learn to identify perspectives expressed at the document level, we train NB against on the bitterlemons corpus, and evaluate how accu-rately NB predicts the perspective of a unseen doc-ument as either Palestinian or Israeli in ten-fold cross-validation manner. The average classification accuracy over 10 folds is reported. We compare three different models, including NB with two dif-ferent inference methods and Support Vector Ma-chines (SVM) (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000). NB-B uses full Bayesian inference and NB-M uses Maximum a posteriori (MAP).
 Table 1: Results of Identifying Perspectives at the Document Level The results in Table 1 show that both NB and SVM perform surprisingly well on both Editors and Guests subsets of the bitterlemons corpus. We also see that NBs further reduce classification er-rors even though SVM already achieves high accu-racy. By considering the full posterior distribution NB-B further improves on NB-M, which performs only point estimation. The results strongly suggest that the word choices made by authors, either con-sciously or subconsciously, reflect much of their po-litical perspectives. 5.2 Identifying Perspectives at the Sentence In addition to identify the perspectives of a doc-ument, we are interested in which sentences in the document strongly convey perspectives. Al-though the posterior probability that a sentence covey strongly perspectives in (6) is of our inter-est, we can not directly evaluate their quality due to the lack of golden truth at the sentence level. Alter-natively we evaluate how accurately LSPM predicts the perspective of a document, in the same way of evaluating SVM and NB in the previous section. If LSPM does not achieve similar identification accu-racy after modeling sentence-level information, we will doubt the quality of predictions on how strongly a sentence convey perspective made by LSPM.
 Table 2: Results of Perspective Identification at the Sentence Level The experimental results in Table 2 show that the LSPM achieves similarly or even slightly better ac-curacy than those of NBs, which is very encourag-ing and suggests that the proposed LSPM closely match how perspectives are expressed at the docu-ment and sentence levels. If one does not explic-itly model the uncertainty at the sentence level, one can train NB directly against the sentences to clas-sify a sentence into Palestinian or Israeli perspec-tive. We obtain the accuracy of 0.7529, which is much lower than the accuracy previously achieved at the document level. Therefore identifying per-spective at the sentence level is much harder than at that the document level, and the high accuracy of identifying document-level perspectives suggests that LPSM closely captures the perspectives ex-pressed at the document and sentence levels, given individual sentences are very short and much less in-formative about overall perspective. In this paper we study the problem of learning to identify the perspective from which a text was written at the document and sentence levels. We show that perspectives are expressed in word us-age, and statistical learning algorithms such as SVM and na  X  X ve Bayes models can successfully uncover the word patterns chosen by authors from differ-ent perspectives. Furthermore, we develop a novel statistical model to infer how strongly a sentence convey perspective without any labels. By intro-ducing latent variables, Latent Sentence Perspective Models are shown to capture well how perspectives are reflected at the document and sentence levels. The proposed statistical models can help analysts sift through a large collection of documents written from different perspectives. The unique sentence-level perspective modeling can automatically iden-tify sentences that are strongly representative of the perspective of interest, and we plan to manually evaluate their quality in the future work.
