 While social media is all about sharing content with a community, few people wish to share everything, with everyone, all the time. This means that users balance be tween making some things public and keeping other content private. The presented dissertation research concerns practices of managing privacy and publicness in social network services (SNS), with a focus on group co-presence, interdependence and differing levels of use activity. The work aims at gaining insight into social id entities and self-presentation in the era of technologically mediated social interaction. The findings are expected to contribute to design solutions that could lighten the privacy and publicness management burden that users of social media currently bear. H5.m.

 Social networking, social netw ork service, group co-presence, privacy management, social identity, self-presentation Conventional privacy and computer security studies focus on threats and risks created by faceless third parties. In social media, end-user privacy concerns are more than before related to real second parties -people who are known also offline and who are anything but faceless. While social media is all about sharing content with a community, few people wish to share everything, with everyone, all the time. This means that users balance be tween making some things public and keeping other content private. As social media has become a part of everyday social interaction, people face the challenges of having to manage dynamically dive rse social relations and their related social identities as users of social media. For instance, in a social network service a person often needs to cope with the co-presence of people that have traditionally belonged to separate social circles such as colleagues, fellow students and family members. Furthermore, individuals are ba lancing not only the privacy and publicness of themselves but also that of others. This makes the balancing of privacy and publicness essentially interdependent in nature. As boyd [1] has stated, in a social network site, privacy is a function of one X  X  disclosures, and th e disclosures about one X  X  self by others in the site. No one can fully control the content concerning him/herself that is being shared. According to boyd and Ellison [2] the most important general research themes in the field of social networking sites so far have been impression management and friendship performance, networks and their structure, online/offline connections, and privacy issues. In their discussion of users X  attitudes and concerns toward the use of the technologies that keep them socially connected, Bregman and Haythornthwaite [3] discuss speak er-audience relations as well as the radicals, that is, root characteristics, of presentation. They highlight the importance of visibility, relation and co-presence in persistent interaction. Their ideas are fruitful in considering group co-presence as it forces  X  X peakers X  to perform simultaneously to multiple audiences. Similarly, Palen &amp; Dourish [6] ha ve named disclosure, identity and characterization of privacy management. These boundaries reflect tensions between conflicting goals . So, privacy management is action that aims at finding a resolu tion of tensions not just between people but, also importantly, between their internally conflicting requirements. The difficulty of group co-presence can be understood better by seeing it as a situation in which there are combined tensions in the boundaries of disc losure and identity. Due to the persistent nature of the interactions in SNS, the boundary of temporality adds to these challenges. Lederer et al. [5] view personal privacy as the set of both deliberate and intuitive practices by which an individual exercises her claim to determine personal information disclosure. The authors have described five common pitfalls to which designs of privacy-affecting systems often succumb: obscuring of potential information flow, obscuring of actual in formation flow, emphasizing configuration over action, lacki ng coarse-grained control, and inhibition of existing practice. The first published article of the dissertation research [4] added a more pronounced group perspective to the emergent SNS research tradition. The study considered th e co-presence of multiple groups important to an individual on the so cial network site Facebook. This study on active users of Facebook de monstrated that even while technical tools for fine-grained shar ing of content are not available, active users of social media find ways to manage their publicness and privacy. Six strategies by whic h the situation is managed were identified. Behavioral strategies consisted of dividing the platform into separate spaces, using suitable channels of communication, and performing self-censorship. Ment al strategies included both the creation of more inclusive in-group identities and the reciprocity of trusting other users and being res ponsible. While users strive for a sense of control, they understand that their individual control is limited. In practice, it is impossible for individuals to achieve full control over the impression they make, in SNS as well as in social interaction in general. In SNS, people are free to decide what they share themselves but they cannot control the content others post about them. Since the users of SNS are interdependent when it comes to managing privacy and publicity, the role of trust becomes especially significant. The current work-in-progress looks into perceptions of interdependence in SNS and explores existing practices applied to overcome the challenges it potentially poses to users. The recently gathered research material focuses on how users perceive interdependence and deal with it. Furthermore, the study based on this set of material l ooks into whether and how users balance privacy and publicness collaboratively. In their study of privacy behavior s, Lewis, Kaufman &amp; Christakis (2008) found that privacy decisions are influenced by one's network, and that active users are more likely to use privacy features. Previous research has been concentrating on frequent users, even though it seems clear that studying infrequent users (those who share little or nothing) and dropout users (those who have seized using a service completely) is necessary for achieving a more complete picture of people X  X  practices of managing their privacy and publicness. While dropout users X  reasons for withdrawal are varied, it is of interest to inve stigate whether some have resigned due to social implications of content sharing. My hypothesis is that when it comes to publicness and privacy management, active users, in additi on to perceiving value in using a service, also, (1) have managed to find successful ways to manage privacy and publicity and/or (2) have been lucky enough not to face disturbing problems related to c ontent sharing (so far). Hence, knowledge of their understandings a nd actions does not show us the entire picture. Dropout users, on the other hand, have had their reasons to seize using a service. While reasons for this may be varied, finding people who have droppe d out of a SNS due to issues in management of privacy and publicness will help us to understand what  X  X ent wrong X  in their cases. According to Razavi &amp; Iverson [7]  X  the real problem with personal privacy in social systems then is how to reconcile the co-presence of various groups that one identifies w ith, in terms of what to share with whom, in a flexible and straight-forward way  X . To address this important issue, my dissertation research focuses on the practices of balancing privacy and publicness in social network services (SNS) and the relation of these to self-p resentation and se lf-construction. The focus is set upon group co-presence, interdependence and differing levels of use activity. The dissertation will form an overview of practices of balancing privacy and publicness in social network services. The work aims at gaining insight into social identitie s and self-presentation in the era of technologically mediated social interaction. Also, the findings are expected to contribute to design solutions that could lighten the privacy and publicness management burden that users of social media currently bear.
