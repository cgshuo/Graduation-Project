 Graph Databases; Real Time Recommendation; Recommen-dation Analysis
Deployment of open source recommendation systems has been shown to be an effective way to increase sale con-versions on a variety of e-commerce sites. However, there remains a large gap between deploying the core algorithm provided by these systems and delivering an application-quality recommendation system, specifically tailored to ad-dress complex and dynamically changing business needs.
We will present a real-time recommendation engine built on our graph data platform that provides the following ex-tensions to a basic recommendation model: 1. True real-time recommendation algorithms : We 2. Streaming updates of user behavior and prod-3. Support for offline recommendation algorithms : 4. Tools for Business-centric requirements : The en-5. Multiple algorithm ensemble support : There is 6. Recommendation feedback tools : Pre-and Post-
Of particular interest to RecSys attendees, we will discuss the technical aspects of a graph-based implementation of the recommendation engine and how it facilitates the rapid design and deployment of an efficient real-time recommen-dation system under a single service. We will briefly discuss the architecture of our graph database system to show how it can efficiently serve a large user base even from a sin-gle server shared-memory architecture. Attendees will also learn about graph-based data modeling and how viewing data from this perspective can lead to new types of business insights and applications that are not easily implemented using traditional relational and/or NoSQL platforms. We will conclude with a brief demonstration of a real deployed application UI to demonstrate the ease by which recommen-dation systems can be implemented and deployed using the engine.
Dr. Adam Anthony received his Ph.D. in computer sci-ence from the University of Maryland Baltimore County in 2009. His expertise is in data clustering, pattern recogni-tion and computing similarity in graphs. He has been work-ing at GraphSQL for three years, one of 7 early members. GraphSQL is developing a next-generation graph database and parallel processing architecture that has been shown to be capable of real-time storage and querying of hundreds of millions of vertices and billions of edges on a single server ar-chitecture. His primary contribution at GraphSQL has been the development of novel parallel graph algorithms within a map-reduce style computational framework for graph data. His primary role is in the direction and development of a flexible, graph-based recommendation engine with an em-phasis on real-time recommendation with business-centric optimization. The recommendation engine is currently used in production systems, delivering revenue-boosting recom-mendation systems with minimal developer effort.

Dr. Yu-Keng Shih received his Ph.D. in computer sci-ence and engineering from The Ohio State University in 2013. His expertise is in graph algorithms, especially in graph clustering, path searching and graph matching. His most recent research was in developing graph clustering algo-rithms for different applications, especially social networks and biological networks. He has been working at GraphSQL for one year. His primary contribution is utilizing Graph-SQL X  X  graph computation platform to develop features on real-time recommendation systems for increasing accuracy and efficiency.

Dr. Ruoming Jin is Founder and CEO of GraphSQL. He was the founding CTO of GraphSQL. Dr. Jin received his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Ohio State University in 2005. Dr. Jin is on long-term academic leave from Kent State University where he is an associate professor (tenured). Dr. Jin is considered a leading expert in Graph Analytics and BigData. He has published almost 100 technical papers in these areas and many of his papers have appeared in leading data mining and database confer-ences and journals, including SIGMOD, PVLDB, SIGKDD, ICDM, TODS, and TKDE. He has served at numerous pro-gram committees including SIGMOD, KDD, PVLDB, ICDM, and served as associate editors of TKDE. Dr. Jin is also a recipient of the prestigious NSF CAREER award.
