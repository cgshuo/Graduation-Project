 Recommending news articles entails additional requirements to recommender systems. Such requirements include special consumption patterns, fluctuating item collections, and highly sparse user profiles. This workshop (NRS X 13@RecSys) brought together researchers and practitioners around the topics of de-signing and evaluating novel news recommender systems. Addi-tionally, we offered a challenge allowing participants to evaluate their recommendation algorithms with actual user feedback. H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ] News; Recommender Systems News article recommendation differs in several ways from other well-known types of recommender systems such as for music and movies: 1) Freshness represents an important aspect. Some-times, freshness is deemed more important than relevancy. On one hand, users are usually interested in most recent news. On the other hand, users sometimes are interested to read previous relevant articles [4, 9, 10, 12, 17, 18], 2) Large volume of news articles make this domain different from other types of Web ob-jects. News articles tend to be in flood within a short period of time, requiring much more computation for recommendation [3, 6, 10, 14, 15], 3) Similarity between news articles does not neces-sarily reflect their relatedness . For instance, two news articles might share a majority of words. Still, their actual topic might differ [13], 4) News are typically published in a rather unstruc-tured format [15]. In contrast, structured data such as social graphs facilitate pre-processing steps, 5) Most news articles de-scribe the occurring of specific events. Online news readers X  in-terests are highly correlated to so-called named entities. Such to avoid time outs, providing flexibility to incorporate new rec-o mmendation methods or adjust parameter settings for existing implementations, and guarantee a reliable service whom user can access at any time. This workshop aimed at creating an interdisciplinary community focusing on the design issues for news recommender systems and promoting collaboration opportunities between researchers and practitioners. We brought together researchers as well as practitioners around the topics of designing and evaluating novel news recommender systems in order to: (1) share research on news recommendation techniques and evaluation methodolo-gies, (2) explore key challenges in the area, and (3) identify emerg-ing topics. The topics of papers submitted to the workshop can be summa-rized as follows: recommendation techniques suited for news recommendation, tracking the evolution of news over time, eval-uation approaches, the interplay of news and social-media data, user interface for news portals and their implications to news recommendation, news mining and analytics, news reader be-havioral models, semantic and news context analysis, user pro-filing and preference elicitation, news recommendations on mo-bile platforms, and informationretrievalin news collections. The papers covered a wide range of different perspective on the field. The accepted papers included a practitioners perspective based on an actual news recommender systems and their data on the one hand. On the other hand, a survey on the state-of-the-art of news recommender systems and their inherent challenges was conducted to illustrate the research perspective. Prior to the workshop, we offered researchers as well as prac-titioners the chance to interact with a real-time news recom-mender system. We released an off-line data set [8] for bootstrap-ping purposes. This data set contained more than 84 million in-teractions recorded over a 4 week period. Subsequently, partic-ipants could directly interact with a news recommender system providing news on several news portals in the time frame from August 15 -September 15, 2013. The participants received actual recommendation request and transmit recommendations. Thus, we were able to mimic the actual requirements for news recom-mender systems. Those requirements included to handle a large amount of request in real-time with a fixed response time limit. At the workshop we presented evaluation results of the challenge. The workshop material (list of accepted papers, invited talk, and the workshop schedule) can be found at the workshop webpage: https://sites.google.com/site/newsrec2013/home . The workshop proceedings are published in the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Papers related could not be submitted before the conference deadline. The challenge-related papers which have been accepted are published as CEUR proceedings.
