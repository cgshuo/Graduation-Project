This special issue in the DKE Journal is following the 12th International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems (NLDB X 07 1 ) hold in Paris in June 2007. At the conference 110 papers were submitted and 31 papers were selected as full papers by an international Program Committee. Among these papers, three have been selected to be extended; they have been rewritten and carefully reviewed to be published in this issue.

Natural Language and databases are core components of Information Systems. They are related to each other because they share the same purpose: the conceptualization aspects of the real world. Thus they share the same problem: under-standing the semantics of data. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques may substantially enhance semantics elicita-tion in most phases of the information system lifecycle, starting with requirement analysis, specification and validation, and going up to conflict resolution, result processing and presentation. Furthermore, natural language based query languages and user interfaces facilitate the access to information for anyone and allow for new paradigms in the usage of computerized services. Sharing information  X  and thus understanding the semantics of external data  X  is the emerging theme in the trend of information systems, mainly due to the research on the Semantic Web.

There is now evidence that the very tool for dealing with complex data semantics is ontology. An ontology is a formal conceptualization of a real world, sharing a common understanding of this real world. The use of ontology is dramatically increasing for these last years, inducing a new research topic that is  X  X  X ntology Engineering X . This area covers: ontology building from scratch, maintaining and evolving of ontologies, reuse of existing ontologies, integration of ontologies, ontol-ogy alignment, editing and display of ontologies, summaries, supporting languages and inductive mechanisms, tools and platforms for ontology management, algorithms for ontology based matching, multilingual ontologies, ontology quality checking, ontology versioning, etc.

The three selected papers deal with different aspects of ontology engineering that are respectively (1) the automated re-use of ontologies, (2) the translation of ontologies in natural language and (3) the use of ontology including common sense for web query processing:
We wish to thank the members of the Program Committee for their fruitful remarks and all the improvements and rewriting they suggested.
