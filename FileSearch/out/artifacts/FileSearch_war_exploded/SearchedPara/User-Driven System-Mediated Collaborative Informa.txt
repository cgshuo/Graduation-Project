 Most of the previous approaches surrounding collaborative information retrieval (CIR) provide either a user-based me-diation, in which the system only supports users X  collab-orative activities, or a system-based mediation, in which the system plays an active part in balancing user roles, re-ranking results, and distributing them to optimize overall retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose to com-bine both of these approaches by a role mining methodology that learns from users X  actions about the retrieval strategy they adapt. This hybrid method aims at showing how users are di  X  erent and how to use these di  X  erences for suggesting roles. The core of the method is expressed as an algorithm that (1) monitors users X  actions in a CIR setting; (2) discov-ers di  X  erences among the collaborators along certain dimen-sions; and (3) suggests appropriate roles to make the most out of individual skills and optimize IR performance. Our approach is empirically evaluated and relies on two di  X  erent laboratory studies involving 70 pairs of users. Our experi-ments show promising results that highlight how role min-ing could optimize the collaboration within a search session. The contributions of this work include a new algorithm for mining user roles in collaborative IR, an evaluation method-ology, and a new approach to improve IR performance with the operationalization of user-driven system-mediated col-laboration.
 H.3.3 [ INFORMATION STORAGE AND RE-TRIEVAL ]: Information Search and Retrieval -Clustering, Retrieval models, Search process Collaborative Information Retrieval Collaborative information retrieval, role mining, user study
In an information retrieval (IR) process, there are sev-eral ways to improve retrieval performance or e  X  ectiveness. Some approaches, such as pseudo-relevance feedback [13] and query expansion [30] focus on improving IR systems and algorithms. Others try to improve users X  experience by o  X  ering related queries [2] or making personalized rec-ommendations [29]. In the end, the e  X  ectiveness of an IR setting has to do with user X  X  preferences and/or skills just as much as it has with system performance. One way that e  X  ectiveness could be improved that is often overlooked is through collaboration. The approaches described above are based on an individual searching, retrieving, and evaluating information. But what if multiple people get involved in these processes? Beyond simply dividing up the work, there could be other potential benefits of multiple people working together on a search-focused project. Specifically, if these people bring in a variety of skills, then we have an oppor-tunity to achieve synergic e  X  ects [22]. The question is how do we know who has which skills and how do we leverage them. We could let the users decide it and let the system be simply a supporting structure. This is often referred to as user-mediated collaborative information retrieval (CIR) [15, 23]. The other option is to have the system explicitly assign prior roles and optimizing retrieval-related processes accordingly. This is often referred to as a system or an algorithmically-mediated CIR [20, 24].

Both of these lines of work have their merits and limita-tions. In this paper, we propose an approach that attempts to combine the best of both of these techniques. Specifi-cally, instead of imposing the roles onto the users (system-mediated) or having the users explicitly come up with their roles (user-mediated), we propose to mine roles of collabora-tors implied within a collaborative search session. We refer to this as user-driven system-mediated CIR. More particu-larly, the contributions of this paper are twofold:
In what follows, we introduce, in Section 2, related work surrounding the CIR domain, and more particularly, the consideration of user roles within this context. Section 3 fo-cuses on the research questions and our role mining method-ology. Section 4 details our experimental setup based on two interactive IR studies and Section 5 presents and discusses the obtained results. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and presents future work.
A collaborative search setting involves multiple users aim-ing at collaboratively solving a shared information need [4, 6, 25]. In [25] authors showed how collaborative search could act as a front-end for existing search engines and re-rank re-sults based on the learned preferences of a community of users. They attempted to demonstrate this concept by im-plementing the I-Spy system [4]. However, this is often in-e  X  ective or non-trivial. For instance, Hyldegard [8], with her studies of information seeking and retrieval in a group-based education setting, found that even though people in a collaborative group to some extent demonstrated similar cognitive experiences as the individuals in Kuhlthau X  X  Infor-mation Search Process (ISP) model [11], these experiences did not only result from information seeking activities, but also from work-task activities and intra-group interactions. Her further work also indicated [9] that group based prob-lem solving is a dynamic process that shifts between a group perspective and an individual perspective.

Complexity in CIR appears mainly from the fact that collaboration is characterized by four main dimensions [6]: (1) the intent , depending on if collaboration is implicit or explicit, (2) the level of mediation , relying on how much the system is active, (3) the concurrency , analyzing if the search session is synchronous or not, (4) the location , de-scribing a session involving remote or co-located users. Ris-ing challenges in CIR [10] underline the practical necessity of building interfaces adapted to collaboration and from an IR perspective, leveraging IR techniques and models for sup-porting collaboration. To tackle these challenges, two main lines of work can be distinguished: user-based mediation and system-based mediation.

Previous user-based mediation work have proposed collab-orative interfaces [16, 23] supporting collaboration within a search process by using devices, such as interactive tables [16], or tools, such as shared workspaces [23]. The second category of work, referred to a system-oriented mediation, relies on the incorporation of symmetric user X  X  roles [3, 17] or asymmetric ones within the IR process [20, 24, 26] with the aim of enhancing the collaboration and by the way, the overall IR performance.

In [6], authors proposed a role taxonomy where several sets of roles have been introduced: (1) symmetric (peers) [6] in which users are considered as having symmetric roles; (2) domain A expert and domain B expert [6, 26] in which users are characterized as experts of di  X  erent domains; (3) search expert and search novice, respectively domain ex-pert and domain novice [6, 27] in which users have di  X  erent familiarity levels towards a domain, or search tools; search expert and domain expert [6] in which one user has access to more functions and features with search tools, whereas the other one is more familiar with the domain knowledge; (4) Prospector and Miner [6, 20] in which Prospector X  X  task is devoted to formulating search requests, whereas the Miner X  X  one consists of selecting relevant documents; Gatherer and Surveyor [24], in which the Gatherer aims at quickly scan-ning documents for identifying relevant ones whereas the Surveyor X  X  task is devoted to favoring diversity.
Several research studies [21, 1, 5, 28] highlighted the value of roles as means of control in collaborative appli-cations. Role is viewed as a tool for better understand-ing users X  actions and interactions by putting them in con-text. For instance, Rodden [21] identified the value of con-trol in computer-supported cooperative work systems and listed a number of underlying projects with their correspond-ing schemes for implementing control. Golder and Donath [5] considered Usenet environment for analyzing newsgroup communities. They proposed a role taxonomy involving two roles which they posit, namely  X  X elebrities X  and  X  X anters X , and three well-know roles, namely  X  X urkers X ,  X  X rolls X  and  X  X ewbies X . They also highlighted the underlying strategies of each role and relationships between roles. Role-based con-trol gives rise to a challenging research question: how can we mine dynamically latent roles from user-group actions and interactions in a collaborative setting?
Two main approaches for role mining are proposed in the literature. The first one, rising from the social network perspective, relies on the analysis of the topology proper-ties of users X  network through information interaction [18, 12, 19, 7]. Nowicki and Snijders [18] presented a block-structure mining method based on pair-wise graph relations using Gibbs sampling. In [12], authors identified microblog networks leaders by applying PageRank algorithm on the followers network while Pal et al. [19] proposed to apply a probabilistic clustering method that uses a set of features from microblogging practices. Henderson et al. [7] provided an unsupervised learning approach for role mining relying on the transformation of feature-based multi-dimensional ma-trix where nodes represent users and edges represent infor-mation stream. The underlying objective is to select the better compression model that summarizes the users X  behav-ior leading to roles. Di  X  erent from the first approach, the second one discovers user X  X  roles by looking at the similari-ties vs. dissimilarities between interaction data distributions among users [14]. Authors proposed, first, the LDA-based Author-Recipient-Topic (ART) model which is a global role mining approach applied in a communication social network for highlighting emerging roles through users X  behavior sim-ilarities. Second, they proposed a pair-wise focused version of the ART by introducing the Role-Author-Recipient-Topic (RART) model which emphasizes roles of the author and the recipient according to the message-contents, assuming that these roles could be fixed or could evolve throughout the message writing process.

Based on relevant literature, we can see that di  X  erent forms of roles have been introduced within a collaborative context, leveraging users X  skills and experiences in order to enhance the collaboration. However, while some research studies focused on mining latent roles from users X  inter-actions, previously proposed system-mediated collaborative ranking models assign explicitly predefined roles to users re-gardless of the skills in which they are the most e  X  ective. In the work reported here, we attempt to combine insights from the above works to bridge between system-mediated and user-mediated collaboration and show how to leverage specific latent roles of collaborators from users X  actions while relaxing the assumption behind pre-assigned roles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt for mining users X  roles within a collaborative search, which enables im-plicitly and dynamically assigning roles to users in which they can be most e  X  ective at the current search stage.
In this work presented here, we do not assign any roles to users in the beginning of the session. Users X  roles are emphasized by users X  actions and are mined throughout the synchronous collaborative search session. Keeping this in mind, we address in this work the following research ques-tions: RQ1. If the searchers working in collaboration are di  X  erent in some aspects, how are they di  X  erent? RQ2. How do we infer users X  roles by taking into account their actions within a collaborative search session? RQ3. How can we use role information to improve CIR and IR processes in general?
We initially consider a user-driven search setting in which a set of users are working to meet a shared information need by identifying relevant documents.

The goal of our approach is to analyze how users are dif-ferent, and, accordingly suggest roles given their di  X  erences in order to optimize their collaborative outcome. In this way, the search session can be viewed as a sequence of two steps: (1) a user-driven level in which we assume that peo-ple start out with the same roles and responsibilities, but then over time, they may exhibit di  X  erences and a ne their search behavior; and (2) a system-mediated level in which predefined roles have been identified, and the system opti-mizes the collaborative search process. In what follows, we first define preliminary notions, and, then describe our role mining methodology. Note that in order to simplify our ex-planation and economize our experiments, we will consider only two participants in a collaborative search process.
Let us consider a typical scenario of collaborative IR where a pair of users ( u 1 ,u 2 ) collaborate during a time interval T in order to answer a shared information need I . Each user acts separately through the synchronous collaborative search session S by formulating his own queries belonging to the shared information need I . For clarity, we introduce the following notions and notations:
The user search session S t u of user u consists of all previous queries q 1 u , q 2 u ,..., q t 1 u ordered by time, up to timestamp t (0 &lt;t&lt;T ), and their corresponding documents results fecting the role mining task is naturally how much the users are di  X  erent while searching for information during the CIR process, we favor a feature-based representation of the user X  X  search session. Our goal is to characterize the user through his past implicit actions X  features F = { f 1 ,...,f k ,...,f (e.g., number of visited pages, dwell time, number of formu-lated queries etc.) captured during his/her search process. To achieve this, S t u is represented as a matrix S ( t ) where each element S ( t ) u ( t l ,f k ) represents the cumulative value of feature f k for user u aggregated across the search session during the time interval [ t 0 ...t l ]. This aggregation highlights the overall behavior of the user at timestamp t since looking at feature values at a particular timestamp may not be enough considering that individual behaviors are con-stantly changing. Moreover, it avoids the bias induced by noisy search actions.

A pair R 1 , 2 of roles ( r 1 ,r 2 ) involves a couple of users ( u 1 ,u 2 ) assumed to have di  X  erent specific search features.
We introduce a role pattern P R 1 , 2 2 P , where P is the role pattern pool, as a set of two elements: )
Finally, our objective is to mine at each timestamp t the represented through the users X  search sessions S ( t ) u 1 and accordingly to assign detected roles to collaborators.
We now introduce our methodology to mine the pair of users X  roles involved in a synchronous collaborative search session. At each regular timestamp t l , a role mining method, illustrated in Algorithm 1, is launched and runs in two main stages, as described in what follows.

Algorithm 1: Role mining in collaborative search setting
Result : { ( r 1 ,r 2 ) , ( r 2 ,r 1 ) } 2 R begin 1. Identifying users X  search behavior di  X  erences. Keeping in mind that a pair of users X  roles implies di  X  erent users X  search actions, the first stage consists of capturing signifi-cant di  X  erences between the users X  search actions through the analysis of their search sessions. More formally, in order to identify the level of di  X  erence between both users u 1 and u 2 with respect to each feature f k 2 F , we use the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test, noted ks.test () in Algorithm 1, between vectors S ( t l ) u 1 ( f S 2 ( f k ). The obtained p -value for the statistical test is u 1 and u 2 have di  X  erent search skills or strategies and thus could play di  X  erent roles in the search session. 2. Identifying users X  roles. Our objective in this stage is to characterize the di  X  erence between the users X  search strategies in contrast to the previous stage that only iden-tifies their di  X  erence. For this aim we attempt to detect candidate role patterns through user X  X  search actions. The method we adopted consists of computing the correlation be-tween the user X  X  search features. More specifically, we con-sider features by pairs and analyze the correlation of users X  di  X  erences towards the considered pairs of features.
Computing the correlation between the feature di  X  erences values rather than the feature values themselves avoids prior assignment of any role to each user. Thus, we compute the correlation between the vectors ( t l ) u 1 ,u 2 ( f j ) and with ( f j ,f k ) 2 F  X  F . We build a di  X  erence matrix R is defined as the di  X  erence of the value of user u 1 and user u 2 towards the search feature f k at timestamp t l : These correlation computations rest on the condition that the significance of both implied search feature di  X  erences be-tween both users is highlighted by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test; otherwise we set the correlation value to 0. where  X  is a significance level.

Afterwards, the role pattern is detected in the case that: More formally, a pair R 1 , 2 of roles ( r 1 ,r 2 ) is assigned to a pair of user ( u 1 ,u 2 )attimestamp t l if it satisfies the follow-ing conditions: where || . || represents the Frobenius norm and is the minus operator defined as: F
Once the pair R 1 , 2 of roles has been detected for a collab-orative group involving users u 1 and u 2 , the respective roles are assigned to collaborators according to the role attribu-
Experimental evaluation is based on two collaborative IR user studies. This section describes these studies, the CIR tasks, the data collected, and the evaluation metrics used.
We consider two user studies, involving pairs of users, recruited at Rutgers University. All of them are students and got compensation for their participation. The search tasks consisted of writing a report on an exploratory topic. Throughout the whole session, participants had the possi-bility to refine their information need by exploring and re-formulating queries dealing with the topic. Each task was supported by a collaborative information system [23], which includes a chat system and search tools enabling participants to bookmark Webpages and save snippets. Participants were allowed to compile snippets for building the final report. In the background, the system recorded search log data, such as visited and bookmarked pages, saved through snippets and submitted queries. Statistics about the both datasets are presented in Table 1. We notice that the repeatability of query words represents the average occurrence number of each word included in a query over the whole set of queries. For instance, in the dataset US1, a query includes in average 5 words and each of them are generally used within 182 other queries. This underlines the fact that queries are mainly is-sued from a reformulation process. Below, we highlight the specificities of each user study:
US1. This study involved 60 dyads working on the ex-ploratory topic of  X  X ulf oil spill X . Participants were given 25 minutes for synchronously working on the exploratory search task and writing the report. The participants were randomly assigned to co-located or remote settings.
US2. This study involved 10 dyads in which participants are distinct to those implied in the first user study. The study setup was similar to the previous one with the follow-ing exceptions: (1) the exploratory task focused on  X  X lobal warming X ; (2) the collaborative information system allowed saving of snippets and not pages as bookmarks; (3) partic-ipants disposed of 30 minutes for solving the exploratory task; and (4) participants disposed of co-located computers.
In order to perform the system-mediated setting, we built a unique document index for the two user studies including: (1) visited pages of the whole set of participants of both user studies; and (2) top 100 Google search results of queries submitted by the whole set of participants. The top search results are extracted using the Google Custom Search API 1 We, thus, obtained a dataset with 74,844 distinct Webpages. The datasets were then parsed to extract title and main content from the Webpages.
From search log data, we extracted three categories of fea-tures, summarized in Table 2, characterizing participants X  search actions. The first category analyzes the query sub-mission process of each participant, for instance by empha-sizing if he is better devoted to formulating queries depend-ing on his intent level of submitting a query, modeled by his query number or if he is looking for diversity with respect to his used vocabulary within the successive submitted queries, modeled by his query overlap value. In addition, we also identified features based on query length and query success. We assume that a query is successful if the retrieved pages are visited for over 30 seconds. The second category anal-yses browsing behavior related to Webpages. For instance, we can analyze with the page dwell time if one participant spends a lot of time for reading one page or not. The num-ber of visited pages, whether normalized by the number of submitted queries or not, shows if a participant is more will-ing to read a lot of documents. The last category analyses the snippet-based browsing behaviors emphasizing if users are more willing to find interesting documents. During our role mining methodology, we estimate the feature value for a[0; t ] time-window for each timestamp t .
In accordance to the literature review, we consider the two role-based collaborative ranking models modeling the Gatherer/Surveyor roles [24] and the Prospector/Miner roles [20].

The Gatherer and Surveyor roles are di  X  erent considering the fact that the Gatherer seeks for highly relevant doc-uments and thus formulates queries with a higher overlap https://developers.google.com/custom-search/ Category Description Measurement Query-based features Page-based features Snippet-based features Number of snippets Number of snippets than the Surveyor whereas the Surveyor spends less time on Webpages favoring the exploration of the information space, and accordingly the average value of query success is lower, than the Gatherer. Thus, we can define the related role pattern through: (1) negative correlation between the query word overlap and spent time on Webpages features; (2) neg-ative correlation between query word overlap and query suc-cess features. The role attribution function underlying this couple of roles specifies that the user with the higher query overlap feature value will be assigned to the role of Gatherer whereas the other one will be detected as the Surveyor. The main di  X  erence between the roles of Prospector and Miner remains on the task performed by each user. The Prospector X  X  task is more devoted for reformulating queries in order to get result diversity whereas the Miner is look-ing for relevant documents. Consequently, we can expect for these roles to have a negative correlation between query overlap and number of submitted queries features. The underlying role attribution function specifies that the user characterized by the most important number of submitted queries will be assigned to the role of Prospector whereas the other one will be detected as the Miner.
We divided the collaborative search sessions into regu-lar timestamps of sixty seconds enabling us to detect users X  search actions di  X  erences, and accordingly to predict their roles within collaboration. We perform the following evalu-ation protocol: 1. For each timestamp t , mine roles that users are per-forming using our methodology detailed in Section 3. 2. If a role pattern is detected, use the queries submitted between timestamps t and t + 1 with these di  X  erent models:
For each dataset, we build the ground truth by considering the whole set of distinct documents which have been visited by at least two di  X  erent users as relevant. Using this process, we obtained 159 and 47 relevant documents for dataset US1 and US2 respectively.

We used collaborative-based metrics aiming at emphasiz-ing the retrieval-based synergic e  X  ect of the collaboration [22]. Considering our CIR setting, we computed these met-rics at the timestamp level as follows:
In this section we present and discuss results, divided in three categories: those measuring di  X  erences between users, those analyzing the extracted roles, and those evaluating the e  X  ectiveness of role mining for CIR.
Regarding the first stage of our methodology, we analyzed the evolving user search actions using the features presented in Table 2. Table 3 illustrates the average absolute di  X  er-ences observed between collaborators of each group accord-ing to each user study with respect to features involved in role patterns presented in Section 4.2, namely the query suc-cess (QS), the number of submitted queries (QN), the query overlap (QO) and the dwell time of visited pages (DWP) at each timestamp, from 1 to 30.

We can see from this table that, for the whole set of fea-tures, absolute di  X  erences among collaborators of at least one group are highlighted as positive and significant in the beginning of the session after the first minute. There-fore, significance of collaborators X  search behavior di  X  erences arises the assumption that users are di  X  erent early in the ses-sion and provide the foundation to our role mining method-ology. This statement is reinforced by the fact that from 75% to 100% of the collaborative groups are characterized by significant di  X  erences between collaborators after 5 min-utes.
In this section, we study how our proposed role mining methodology acts in the collaborative search setting. For this purpose, we define three metrics aiming at measuring the changes of mined roles within a search session: 1. The number of role couples , noted N couples , normalized by the number of timestamps, respectively 25 and 30 for US1 and US2, for analyzing the stability of users X  behavior di  X  erences throughout the search session. More particularly, it measures the number of changes within chronologically mined couples of roles, for which we add the couple of role mined for the first timestamp. We assume that there is a change when, from timestamp t to timestamp t + 1, the roles assigned to the pair of users are di  X  erent. A value close to 1 means that the detected couples of roles are di  X  erent for each two successive timestamps while a value close to 0 reflects that the pair of users have constant behaviors throughout the search process. 2. The number of distinct roles , noted N roles , assigned to a particular user, throughout the search session also normalized by the number of timestamps. We consider five possibilities of individual roles: Prospector, Miner, Gatherer, Surveyor or nothing. We note that the maximum value, highlighting that a user is detected performing each of these five roles in a session, is 0 . 2 for US1 and 0 . 16 for US2. 3. The couple-role ratio , noted R change , which helps to analyze if, for the same detected couple of roles at two dif-ferent timestamps within the search session, the same role is assigned to the same user or if behaviors have changed to what extend roles of collaborators became opposite. For instance, a user might be Prospector in the beginning of the session and Miner at the end. For this purpose, we compute the ratio R change of the number of role couples N couples the number of distinct roles N roles for each collaborative search session. A value equals to 1 highlights that, even if the assigned couple of roles to the pair of users varies and is redundant throughout the session, roles within a cou-ple are steadily assigned to the same user. In other words, when a user is detected as a Gatherer at one timestamp t of the session, if the Gatherer-Surveyor couple is again mined at timestamp t 0 , this user will be still detected as a Gath-erer. A value lower than 1 for a collaborative group reflects that, for at least one couple of roles detected at two di  X  er-ent timestamps, each user received successively the di  X  erent associated roles, e.g. Gatherer at timestamp t and Surveyor at timestamp t 0 . In contrast, a ratio value is lower than 1 means that the couples of roles detected for the group varies more than the evolution of users X  search behaviors when the same couple of roles is detected.
 Table 4 gives statistics of these metrics for both datasets. More particularly, we computed the average value and the range, under the format  X  X verage [ min max ] X .
 Table 4: Analysis of the evolution of mined roles throughout the search session.

We can see from Table 4 that, for both user studies, (1) the low number of changes in terms of couples N couples and dis-tinct roles N roles and (2) the couple-role ratio value R very close to 1, highlight a certain stability in roles assigned, first, to the pair of users, and second, to the individual users themselves.

Indeed, the normalized number N couples of couples, re-spectively 0.13 and 0.08 for US1 and US2, reflects that gen-eral search behaviors of the pairs are stable over the session. We notice that participants X  behaviors of the first user study US1 are less stable than the second one US2 as we detected more changes in terms of mined couples of roles. Both user studies have equivalent results in terms of distinct role num-ber mined for individual user with a value equal to 0.09. Thus, statements are slightly opposite, although both close to 1, with respect to the couple-role ratio for both user stud-ies: pairs of participants in US1 are slightly more variant in terms of global search behaviors than individual ones which means to what extend we detected more mined couples of roles than for the roles assignment for a solely participant. In contrast, in US2, users X  intrinsic search behaviors fluctu-ate more than mined couples of roles in so far as that, for the same couple of roles detected at two di  X  erent timestamps, the same user was labelled di  X  erently.

This analysis lets us explore if the time window of the role detection impacts the retrieval e  X  ectiveness of such CIR sce-nario. To this aim, we estimated the retrieval e  X  ectiveness of our role-based CIR scenarios, noted RB-CIR by computing the role mining methodology for a time window from 1 to 5 minutes. Table 5 illustrates the obtained results considering the F-measure. Beforehand, we highlight that metric val-ues are low due to the small number of relevant documents building the relevance judgement for each dataset. We can notice from Table 5 that, for the user study US2, even if the retrieval e  X  ectiveness seems to be higher for a 5-minutes time window, results are not significantly di  X  erent due to the low number of groups. However, in the first user study, namely US1, the optimal time window is 1 minute. The analysis of student statistical tests highlights that the 1-minute time window-based retrieval e  X  ectiveness is significantly higher ( p&lt; 0 . 05) than the other settings; and settings based on 2, 3, 4 or 5 minutes are not statistically significant between each other. This shows that, even if the mined roles role-couples do not vary significantly a lot, it remains however more e  X  ective to propose a mining for each minute in order to better fit users X  search behaviors and therefore optimize the collaboration within the search session. For this reason, in the remainder of the paper, we consider a 1-minute time window for mining roles of collaborators.
 Table 5: Impact of the role mining time window on the retrieval e  X  ectiveness. US1 0.01673 0.01650 0.01654 0.01649 0.01647 US2 0.07061 0.06683 0.06931 0.06650 0.07203
We also performed a correlation analysis among the couple-role ratio and the F-measure. Results showed non significant correlations among the involved variables: re-spectively 0.003 and -0.003 for both dataset US1 and US2. This highlights that the retrieval e  X  ectiveness of our pro-posed CIR setting based on role mining does not depend on the number of distinct mined roles for a user, but rather on adapting the ranking model to users X  search behaviors.
Here, we measure and discuss the impact of role mining on the overall retrieval e  X  ectiveness of a collaborative search session. To this aim, we average, for each metric, their values over the whole set of participant groups. Significance level used in our methodology is fixed to  X  =0 . 05.

Table 6 shows the comparative results between the re-trieval e  X  ectiveness of our role-based CIR setting, noted RB-CIR , and the four baseline settings, namely BM25-CIR , GS-CIR , PM-CIR and Ra-CIR , described in Section 4.3.
Results highlight significant improvements for most of the collaborative-based retrieval measures. For user study US1, mining users X  roles significantly enhance the retrieval e  X  ec-tiveness of the overall session from +10 . 408% to +18 . 316% for the precision metrics, except a non significant decrease for the Prospector-Miner-based CIR scenario. In contrast, the improvements for user study US2 are less significant due to the fact that this study involves less collaborative ses-sions and therefore, the significance of student test is more di cult to reach. Nevertheless, we obtained significant im-provements from 52 . 786% to 63 . 818% with respect to the GS-CIR baseline setting.

More generally, we notice the following general trends for both datasets:
Thus, we can conclude that mining roles within a collab-orative search session optimizes the collaboration and im-proves the synergic e  X  ect of collaborators.
Our objective here is to analyze more in-depth retrieval e  X  ectiveness across time of our proposed methodology-based scenario, noted RB-CIR , and the four baseline settings, namely BM25-CIR , GS-CIR , PM-CIR and Ra-CIR . Thus, for each timestamp t , we average over all participant groups their F-measure at rank R for timestamp t ,estimatedby combining Prec @ R ( g ) t and Recall @ R ( g ) t , as detailed in Equation 7. Figure 1 illustrates the retrieval e  X  ectiveness for the five settings according to each timestamp of the search session. For the first user study, namely US1, the curve representing system-driven approach surrounded by role mining, namely RB-CIR , generally overpasses the base-line curves. This statement is more slightly identifiable in Figure 1b due to the low number of collaborative groups de-tected as performing a couple of roles for a particular times-tamp. Therefore, di  X  erences between RB-CIR and baseline settings are more variable and non-significant. Neverthe-less, we can conclude that mining roles generally optimizes the collaboration throughout the search process. Moreover, graphics highlight that the e  X  ectiveness of our method seems to decrease at the end of the session. It can be explained by the fact that sessions were fixed and quite long, between 25 and 30 minutes, and we noticed during user studies that participants were less involved in the task at the end of the session. We can assume, therefore, that the cognitive e  X  ort for reformulating queries was higher which may negatively impact the information need expression, and therefore, the reliability of mined roles in this unstable context.
Collaboration can be a useful strategy in many situations, including information retrieval. As researchers have shown [20], using collaboration one could achieve something greater than the sum of individual searchers X  contributions. A way to achieve this synergy is by leveraging diverse sets of skills brought by di  X  erent people [22].

In this paper, we proposed a user-driven system-mediated approach for mining organically emerging user roles and us-ing that information to improve upon various aspects of re-trieval performance including relevance and novelty. Specif-ically, we presented a new role mining methodology that helps us understand how two searchers collaborating in an exploratory search task are di  X  erent. Using this knowledge, we were able to suggest roles for these users to follow for the rest of their search sessions. Using simulations on two di  X  erent user study datasets for what would happen if such suggestions were followed, we were able to show promising results highlighting the benefit of role mining.

This work has a few limitations. For instance, it assumes that a user X  X  role or in general search behavior can be ex-tracted using his actions. The proposed algorithm also ig-nores any prior knowledge or preferences about the users. This limitation can be addressed by creating a hybrid model that takes into consideration a user X  X  past behavior and pref-erences, in addition to current actions during a search ses-sion. For the future work, we also plan to derive role patterns through the users X  search session relying on meta-roles, not necessarily defined within a role taxonomy.
