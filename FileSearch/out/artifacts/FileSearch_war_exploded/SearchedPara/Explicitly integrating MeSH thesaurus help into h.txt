 1. Introduction Using the Internet to look for health information is a common behavior for consumers. According to the Pew Internet and significant mismatches between the consumer terminology, and both the information source terminology and standard however, is that consumers may lack the domain knowledge needed to choose the right query phrases and their vocabulary  X  vocabulary mismatch problem ( Gault, Schultz, &amp; Davies 2002; Hersh, 2009; Shultz, 2006 ).

By providing controlled vocabularies, synonyms and closely related concepts, a medical thesaurus enables users to for-mulate queries that retrieve potentially relevant information not expressed in layperson terms. There are more than 150 medical thesauri in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. Among them, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) is one of the most commonly used to facilitate health information retrieval ( Yeganova et al., 2009 ).
MeSH is a tree-structured controlled vocabulary produced by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to facilitate biomed-mation retrieval system. After finding a few good citations, a domain expert may successfully look at the MeSH thesaurus solution is to provide automatic MeSH term expansions, such as is implemented in PubMed.

PubMed is a text-based search and retrieval system developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). According to the National Library of Medicine, in 2002 one third of PubMed X  X  users came from the general public technique called  X  X  X utomatic Term Mapping X  X  was offered to automatically add related MeSH terms behind the scenes ( Yeganova et al., 2009 ). For example, a user X  X  plain text query  X  X  X umor in breast X  X  will be modified as Terms] OR  X  X  X reast X  X  X All Fields] vocabularies used, and why documents containing the term  X  X  X reast neoplasms X  X  may appear on top of the result list for a search query of  X  X  X reast cancer X  X .

Another commonly used MeSH thesaurus help component is the MeSH Browser which is an online MeSH vocabulary the descriptors is available allowing users to identify narrower, broader, and closely related terms. While both PubMed and MeSH Browser could be very helpful to users, their usefulness may be hindered because each system exists indepen-are made to information contained within the helpful MeSH Browser tool.

The other is augmented with the MeSH Term Brower and MeSH Tree Browser help components, which we call MeshMed. We would like to explore how vocabulary-help components such as the MeSH Term

Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. Srinivasn X  X  studies (1996a, 1996b) on the MEDLINE test collection demonstrated the effectiveness of MeSH thesaurus query expansion. Results from studies by Lu et al. (2009) and Stokes, Li, Cavedon, and Zobel (2009) using the TREC Genomics Track 2006 and 2007 data also confirmed performance improvements after using MeSH thesaurus query expansion. Recently, Yeganova et al. (2009) further explored this issue on the PubMed search system.

Studies have been conducted to explore a variety of other help options for both consumer and professional users in health information seeking tasks. A typical application is the introduction of an intermediary system to provide advice

Each MeSH term is a node in the tree with a parent node (broader term), a number of children nodes (narrower terms), and some sibling nodes navigation application is the MeSH Browser provided by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). information retrieval system.

In summary, from this brief literature review, we found that many studies have been conducted to explore effective the-saurus-based help mechanisms and to better understand users X  search behaviors in health information retrieval. However, tured browsing help components into health information retrieval systems and how these components influence consumers X  search behaviors. 2.1. Research goals
To study the related issues in the integration of MeSH thesaurus help components into health information retrieval, we conducted an empirical comparison study. We designed two health information retrieval systems: one had a simple inter-face to support traditional query-based searching, which we called SimpleMed; and the other, which we called MeshMed, was augmented with two additional components X  X eSH Term Browser and MeSH Tree Brower. In this study we have three major research goals: 2.2. Methodology
In this section we first introduce the interfaces of the two study systems: SimpleMed and MeshMed. We then describe the procedure. 2.3. System interface 2.3.1. SimpleMed
One health information retrieval system we developed is called SimpleMed. It supports two basic components. The main component is called the Search Browser, a general search component similar to most web search systems such as Google. title will open a new Popup Page component as a tabbed page. In this way, the main search interface (Search Browser) is always available and users do not have to use the  X  X  X ack X  X  button repeatedly to return to their result list. 2.3.2. MeshMed
The second health information retrieval system we developed is called MeshMed, which supports natural language search, MeSH term search, and hierarchical MeSH tree navigation. MeshMed was implemented based on SimpleMed and augmented with two new components: the MeSH Tree Browser and the MeSH Term Browser. In Fig. 1 , on the left is the Search Browser that is available in both systems, to its right on the top is the MeSH Tree Browser, and beneath the MeSH Tree Browser is the MeSH Term Browser.

The MeSH Tree Browser, or Tree Browser for simplicity, displays the hierarchical tree of MeSH terms. It allows a user to expand or collapse a tree node to navigate to more general or more specific MeSH terms. The MeSH Term Browser, or Term and previous indexing ( Fig. 2 ). The meaning of each MeSH description item is predefined and can be found at NLM MeSH PubMed.  X  X

Both the Tree Browser and Term Browser are supported with the MeSH vocabulary downloaded from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) in XML format. We parsed the XML data into a backend MySQL database and linked it to our Lemur search the Java search engine to support real-time search.

For an example, one query description in OHSUMED is Patient information: 60 year old menopausal woman without hormone replacement therapy Information request: Are there adverse effects on lipids when progesterone is given with estrogen replacement therapy Our search topic is phrased as

Measurements
To address our first research goal about system effectiveness, we measured participants X  perceived topic familiarity change, time spent and question X  X nswer performance. The perceived topic familiarity change score was obtained from time spent refers to how much time a participant spent interacting with a search system. We believe this variable partly reflects participants X  engagement in search tasks, which should be encouraged in a successful browsing-based search tool ( O X  X rien and Toms, 2008; White &amp; Marchionini, 2007 ).
 The disagreements between the two sets were solved in the panel discussion and by consulting additional outside experts. performance scores and the reported topic familiarity change scores.
 In accordance to the three variables, we have three hypotheses: H1 : users perceive that they gain more topic familiarity when using MeshMed as opposed to SimpleMed. H2 : users are more likely to answer the questions correctly when using MeshMed as opposed to SimpleMed.
H3 : users are encouraged to spend more time interacting with and searching the system when using MeshMed as opposed to SimpleMed.

To examine the contributions of the two new components towards effective health information retrieval, we used another iarity change. Another is the time a participant spent on each system component.

According to the number of participants X  clicks on the search system components and the sequences of these clicks, we extracted the pattern of shifts between different search system components and the frequencies of using each component. Typical search strategies were then summarized from analyzing these coded patterns and shifts.
Finally, we triangulated our findings with participant comments gathered from the post-experiment questionnaire. 2.8. Study design and procedure A within-subject design was used. Each participant used both MeshMed and SimpleMed to search six topics (three with

We noted that except for topic one, MeshMed was reported to be change (2.48 or 118.10% increase) when using MeshMed compared to using SimpleMed (1.76 or 88.0% increase). This is par-ticularly true for topic two (100% vs. 25.86%).

With the randomization design, it was assumed that the two user groups (MeshMed vs. SimpleMed) would be homog-dard deviation 1.43. The mean topic familiarity score for MeshMed was 2.08 with a standard deviation 1.60.
In order to compare the mean topic familiarity change scores of both groups, we first averaged the topic familiarity cated that the MeshMed group reported a significantly higher perceived topic familiarity change score than the SimpleMed group (Hypotheses H1). 3.1.2. Performance testing scores There were 45 participants in the study and each answered six questions. As a result, we obtained 270 question X  X nswers. Among them, 224 were validated answers (83.0%). The remaining 46 question X  X nswers (17.0%) were either blank or  X  X  X /A. X  X 
We did not count them as wrong answers because in the study we allowed participants to skip questions. There were 34 such answers from participants using SimpleMed and 12 from participants using MeshMed. For the 224 validated answers, 101 of them were from participants using SimpleMed (45.09%) and 123 from participants using MeshMed (54.91%). both SimpleMed and MeshMed. We noted that more wrong answers (26.7%) were given when using SimpleMed for search-ing than using MeshMed (8.9%). Meanwhile, more correct answers were given with MeshMed (56.1%) than with SimpleMed questions correctly or partially correctly than the SimpleMed users (Hypotheses H2).

We further conducted a Spearman X  X  rho correlation analysis between the question X  X nswer scores and the reported topic achieved in their question X  X nswer scores. 3.1.3. Time spent
Table 4 lists the time spent by participants on MeshMed and SimpleMed, as well as the specific time spent on the com-ponents. In order to compare the mean total time spending of both groups, we first averaged the spending time for three rejected.

In summary, we found MeshMed was more effective than SimpleMed in terms of the topic familiarity change and the the two systems. 3.2. Component contributions In the study, we also asked participants to report the contribution of a component (Search, Term and Tree Browsers and tion from each component would add up to 100% and the results are listed in Table 5 .

On average, we found that the contribution from the Search Browser was close to the contribution from the Popup Page for the traditional SimpleMed interface. When rating MeshMed, users reported that the most useful component was the Term Browser (35.18%), contributing 34.2% more than the traditional Search Brower component (25.79%). Relatively, the Tree Browser contributed the least towards a participant X  X  topic familiarity change (15.5%).

Table 6 lists the percentage of time spent on each of the components for the two systems. On average, for SimpleMed, users spent more time on the Popup Page (57.65%) than on the Search Browser (42.35%). With MeshMed, the Term Browser was the most widely used component (32.07%), while the Tree Browser was the least used one (8.73%).
Comparing the data of Tables 5 and 6 , we noted that the distribution patterns were similar. In general, the more time most helpful component. We also noted that participants regarded the Tree Browser, another new component, as the least helpful component towards their topic familiarity changes, and did not use it as much as other components. However, the tribution to users X  topic familiarity changes than the Search Browser and the Popup Page, neither new search component rich search strategies. 3.3. Patterns and behaviors 3.3.1. Between-component interactions
For the traditional SimpleMed system, users X  search strategies are limited because there are only two between-compo-ever, users may have additional options to choose from. Given four functional components in MeshMed, there are 12 unique shifting patterns founded and their frequency of use. We noted that the interactions between the Term Browser and the
Search Browser (No. 2 and No. 3 in frequency) were almost as frequent as the traditional move from the Search Browser to the Popup Page pattern. In the study, we observed that many participants used such Search Browser-Term Browser inter-terms in the Term Browser, and then reformed the queries in the Search Browser in order to improve their search. Such to establish a clear concept about the search topic. We will further discuss this issue in Section 4 .
Table 8 provides an alternate way to look at the patterns of component shifts and provides us with a number of interest-the Search Browser. This observation may indicate that the Term Browser worked as a tool for participants to bridge the medical vocabulary gap so more accurate queries could be formulated in the Search Browser.
 3.3.2. Typical search strategies
By using different between-component shifts and their combinations, a participant was able to develop a unique search participants (with a total of 135 individual search cases), we identified seven typical search strategy patterns. each MeshMed component (Search Browser, Popup, Tree Brower, and Term Browser). For example, a bar aligned with the

After finishing all six search topics, the participants were asked to share their comments about each component. 3.4.1. The term browser
The majority of participants (34 out of 45) explicitly mentioned that the Term Browser was helpful in providing medical term definitions. For example:  X  X  X ery effective...simple point and click interface, quick access to accurate, concise information. X  X  (user 13) this is very helpful. X  X  (user 23)

In the post-experiment questionnaire we asked each participant to specify which interface (MeshMed or SimpleMed) ipants was that MeshMed provided them with alternative means to search for information. For example:
Nine participants indicated that the combination of the Tree Browser and the Term Browser matters. For instance:  X  X  X t was easier to use the term search and the tree search for subjects that may be unfamiliar.

In fact, three participants specifically mentioned that MeshMed was easier to use. For example:  X  X  X  received better search results. I also found it easier to use X  X  (user 11) . 4. Discussion 4.1. New MeSH components and search strategies
Our comparison of SimpleMed and MeshMed found that although adding two new components took away from a sim-plified interface, users preferred MeshMed when researching health information. MeshMed was more effective than Simple-
Med in terms of increasing topic familiarity and boosting question X  X nswering performance. Despite the clean and simple interface of SimpleMed, most participants considered MeshMed to be more helpful.

Another interesting observation, which was also corresponding well to Wildemuth X  X  finding (2004), was the participants X  using the map inappropriately. Some negative comments from participants about the Tree Browser may be attributed to using the Tree Browser in this way.

As users became more familiar with the MeshMed interface, their search strategies also changed. One of the main advan-tages of MeshMed is the synchronized interaction between the different components. After a query is submitted in the Search Browser or the Term Browser, the Tree Browser will automatically zoom into related MeSH terms and tree structure. map becomes very helpful in providing additional information about the neighborhoods such as the location of shopping malls, parks and schools.

The gap between users X  medical terminology and the terminology used in health information retrieval databases makes it by developing a system (MeshMed) with integrated MeSH Term Browser and MeSH Tree Browser components. In this study we compared MeshMed to a simple-interface system without these components (SimpleMed).
