K.3.1 Computer Uses in Education ---Collaborative Learning. Design, Human Factors. Mobile storytelling, Geographic narrative, Community history The growing ubiquity of smart phones have created a broad interest in the field of mobile, location-based storytelling, or geo-narratives. Geo-narratives re ly on mobile technologies, specifically smart phones X  geo-locating services, to give users a sense of narrative agency based on their location. For geo-narratives, the real-world location in which narrative is presented to users is essential. In many cases, geo-narratives transmit story through narration stored via digital audio files. These narrative segments --narrative nodes for non-linear geo-narratives --are location-dependant, often triggering only when the user is near the location assigned to the narrative segment. As a result, geo-narratives strive to tell stories about places to users present in those same places. The melding of geographic data and traditional storytelling methods demonstrates great potential for educators across the social sciences. Geography scholar s often cite geo-narratives as an example of an emerging tr end toward Neogeography, whose practitioners use geographic information not for staging claims on scientific standards, but inst ead  X  X end towards the intuitive, expressive, personal, absurd, and/or/ artistic X  [6]. This increased accessibility has led the  X  X ise of volunteered geographic information, crow d sourcing, Neogeography and citizen science, amongst many ot her newly emerging terms linked to the geographic profession X  [6]. However, despite the drive toward web 2.0 technologies, aut horing a geo-narrative for mobile platforms remains a high-barrier proposition difficult to crowd source. Geografia sought to be an authoring tool for geo-narratives that was powerfully flexible, yet accessible. It strived to allow community curators to (1) crowd source the creation of narrative segments to community members, (2) assign those narrative segments to locations across the community, and (3) easily manipulate those segments into linear and non-linear story structures. In essence, Geografia sought to give communities the power to author a geo-narrative detailing their own history to share with visitors and community members --ultimately, a community-created virtual heritage environment (VHE). This paper details the design of the Geografia platform and a walk-through of its final iterati on. The paper X  X  final section discusses design and ethical imp lications raised from its first deployment in which approximate ly 80 secondary school students collaborated to form a geo-narrativ e of a controversial event in their community X  X  history. Industry and state-funded proj ects explore location-based applications within the tourism industry, historical site visitations and education across the social sciences [1 -3]. In addition, several case studies continue to craft narratological frameworks for geo-located storytelling across the arts. Such frameworks include VHEs, virtual spaces in which users may freely navigate and activate non-linear story nodes [4]. Educators argue the benefits of st orification when relating history to students, citing its ability to overcome  X  X ragmentation of the knowledge of historical characters and events by relating these with meaningful connections of temporality and sequence X  [7]. InStory [1] seeks to incorporate an interactive digital narrative across a historically significant site, Quinta da Regaleira in Sintra, Portugal. Barbas and Correira seek to guide visitors through the heritage site, helping them  X  X ap out the vast and intricate geographical area and show the thematic or historical places that could interest [them] among the more than 20 sites X  [1]. InStory is driven by a system of fictional threads that repeatedly adjust according to users X  location in physical space. Geo-narratives share many aspects with Hybrid-reality games (HRGs), or alternate-reality games (ARGs), all of which take users X  real-world locations as i nputs that serve as users X  main form of agency [5]. For ARGs and HRGs, these inputs are often translated into a digital, representational space where player interactions and scores are computed according to gameplay rules and presented back to users via mobile phone screens. Geografia takes its title from the Esperanto word for geography, reflecting its hopes for encouraging knowledge convergence across varied communities. Geografia proposes an authoring environment that allows community curators to (1) crowd source the creation of narrative segments to community members, (2) assign those narrative segments to locations across the community, and (3) easily manipulate those segments into linear and non-linear story structures. Those persons in the role of comm unity curators are tasked with soliciting narrative assets from community members. These assets may take various forms, including digital slideshows, images, text, audio narration, or film clips. Once these assets are collected, community curators upload the assets onto the Geografia server. From here, community curators can assign geographic markers, ties to physical locations across the community, to each asset and edit their behavior. The assignment of assets and editing of geographic markers are the primary building blocks for a geo-narrative authored via the Geografia platform. Geografia proposes an authoring environment whose workflow is split across three steps: authoring, testing, and presenting. To accommodate these three steps, the Geografia platform consists of three sections: (1) a marker library for storing and editing narrative nodes and their corresponding assets, the primary authoring environment, (2) a we bsite for off-site viewing and testing, entitled the stage test and (3) a mobile web-application for on-site viewing, the final product. The three sections are outlined in detail in the sections below. The marker library served as the primary authoring environment for community curators. Within th e library, curators are tasked with (1) creating markers that correspond to physical locations across the community, posts on which to tether the community-created assets, (2) linking each community-created asset to a marker, and (3) editing each marker X  X  behavior parameters. To create markers, curators i nput a new pair of coordinates (longitude and latitude), a name for the marker, and an optional text description. Once created, markers appear in the marker list as shown in figure 1. To link community-created assets to existing markers, curators select the desired marker from the marker list and enter the desired asset X  X  file name in the corresponding field. To edit a marker X  X  behavior, curators select the desired marker from the marker list to access a variety of adjustable behavior parameters. These parameters include the following: is dependant on the user X  X  visita tion of other markers. For this parameter, curators may list a series of markers that must be visited prior to the selected marker. A marker is withheld from the mobile web application X  X  map until all its dependencies are met. For example, if a curator lists Marker 2 as dependant on 
Marker 1 , Marker 2 will remain inactive un til the user visit the location of Marker 1 . this parameter on or off. When turned on, the selected marker does not appear on a user X  X  mobile web application map until that user is physically near the marker. For example, Marker 1 is titled Old Post Office and corresponds to the location of the town X  X  historical post office. With location-based discovery turned on, the Old Post Office marker will not be visible to a user across town; however, a user who is at the historical post office X  X  location is able to interact with the Old Post Office marker and view its corresponding assets. paths at adjustable speeds. For this parameter, curators input destination coordinates (latitude and longitude) and a travel time (in seconds). As soon as a marker appears on the map, the marker animates from its star ting position to its destination coordinates, its speed determined by the allotted travel time. 
Curators have the ability to creat e a series of these animations in order to form a more complex movement tracks. For example, curators may choose to capture the movement of historical figures, parades, or riots as they passed through town. These three behavior parameters are mutually compatible, so that curators may design complex behaviors through the myriad combinations of parameters. The curators may, for example, create the following three markers with the corresponding parameters: discovery: no; path animation: none. location-based discovery: no; path animation: none. location-based discovery: no; path animation: to Town Hall in 10 seconds. In the above example, a newly arrive d user stands near the site of the town X  X  old elementary school and sees the marker Town Hall as the only marker on the mobile web application X  X  map. Once the user walks to Town Hall  X  X  location and interacts with its corresponding assets, the user m ay receive a hint to go to where a historical town leader was educated. Upon returning to the site of the old elementary school, the marker The Elementary School appears. Once the user views The Elementary School  X  X  corresponding assets, the marker Town Parade appears on the user X  X  map. Once the user reaches Town Parade  X  X  location and activates the marker, the marker immediately begins to trace a path toward town hall. The stage test served as a traditional website on which a curator could see all created markers visualized on a map of the community as seen in figure 2, mirroring the final mobile web application, and access markers X  corresponding assets off site. The stage test employed an icon to represent a perspective user X  X  location on the map. Curators were free to click and drag this icon to mimic movements in physical space, and in so doing, test complex marker behaviors and us e-cases for potential audiences. The stage test and marker library are designed so that curators can easily switch between them; updates made to the marker library are instantly viewable on the stage test. The final product took the form of a mobile web application consisting of two parts: (1) the interactive map, and (2) the marker list. with markers. Once near a visible marker, users tap on the marker to activate an information card with the marker X  X  name, description and link to its corresponding assets. community X  X  markers, no matter their visibility according their respective parameters. The marker list allows users an easy access to markers they may have previously discovered or markers tied to assets that the users or users X  friends or family may have authored. An exploratory study was conducte d to evaluate Geografia as a platform for authoring a community-created VHE and identify more focused avenues for future research. Graduate student researchers at the University of Central Florida served as community curators. Graduate students recruited the support of a local community high school whose social science teachers were eager to incorporate Geografia in to their current curriculum, the civil rights movement. As a topic, grad students and collaborating teachers chose to establish a VHE that would serve as a memorial for several African-Americans who died during a tumultuous town riot at the turn of the 20 th century. Four social science classes, approximately 80 students, were tasked with interpreting historical documents and secondary sources in order to craft the digita l assets that would serve as the building blocks of the town X  X  geo-narrative. Serving as community curators, grad students checked these assets for historical accuracy, assigned them to geographical markers, and arranged the markers into a linear narrative. Although some submissions were displayed intact, many were present in edited form. Most intere stingly, these assets serve as creative interpretations, a moment  X  X  glimpses into a student X  X  interactions with primary and s econdary source materials, as well as their place along cultural boundaries. Student assets depict a decidedly modern ideology of an egalitarian society, oftentimes disassociating themselves from the  X  X acist whites, X  as they were often labeled. Although perhaps out of place within the confines of the project X  X  historical contex t, these interpretations allow for interesting insight into student reactions to their community X  X  past and a struggle to define their role within it. One student, for example, choosi ng to animate a white family fleeing from the riot, describes a meeting between the white family and Hispanic friends in north Florida.  X  X ut why did you guys leave, you X  X e white, X  says the Hispanic friend.  X  X es, X  they respond.  X  X ut we wouldn X  X  want our children to grow up in that kind of society. X  In another asset, students recr eate a dialogue exchange at a woman X  X  club between white club members and an African-American widow a mere five years after the riot.  X  X  X  X  so sorry that you lost your husband X  says a white club member.  X  X t must have been a very terrible sight to see, looking out your window at all the white protestors. X  Confrontations regarding the project arose when city council members reacted negatively to students X  classification of the riot as a massacre. Meanwhile, collaborating teachers and students felt strongly justified in their classification. The theme of civil rights and the judgment --perceived and real --of a community X  X  past actions stri kes particularly contentious and passionate conflicts. However, Ge ografia gives rise to several ethical implications no matter its target theme. Foremost of them community X  X  history. It is clear from Geografia X  X  pilot study that this problem needs clear cons ideration. Most importantly, Geografia must not be positioned as an authentic, non-biased historical retelling on par with museum-curated VHEs. Although it is difficult to measure whether or not community members believed as such, future implemen tations of Geografia must take further efforts to brief communities on the ethical considerations of community-created history. However, despite the generated c onflict, it is the researcher X  X  conjecture that Geografia serves as a platform for historical interpretations, a snapshot of i ndividuals X  intersection with their community X  X  past and their family X  X  place within it. As such a tool, Geografia reflects more cl osely the methodologies exhibited in Neogeography: the intuitive, the expressive, the personal. Ethical implications raised through Geografia promote a awareness of author motivation, and as such may serve as an potential tool for media-literacy training. Additionally, these considerations may serve to enc ourage participating students to engage in an authentic community of practice, navigating issues of interpretation, conflicting primary sources, as well as quandaries of ethics and perspective that closely emulate that of professional historians. Interactions with collaborating teachers and students hint at an increased level of engagement, many citing the particular draw of creating a tangible narrative that they could walkthrough and showcase. Teachers also cited the benefits of historical storification coupled with the act of creating assets that fit specific town locations. This observed increase in student engagement hints at the potential effects of branding historical events to well-known physical spaces . More focused research to test hypothesises in this area must be conducted in future Geografia implementations. Interactions with collaborating teachers and students hint at the potential of community-created geo-narratives for engaging students in social science classr ooms. Future research hopes to explore the potential of coupling historical events to well-known physical locations through focused hypothesis testing and student questionnaires. Geografia is an authoring tool that gives communities the power to create a virtual heritage environment detailing their town X  X  history. Geografia proposes an authoring environment that allows community curators to (1) crowd source the creation of narrative segments to community members, (2) assign those narrative segments to locations across the community, and (3) easily manipulate those segments into linear and non-linear story structures. Deploying Geografia raises several ethical considerations regarding community -created history that require serious consideration. However, preliminary data hints at the potential of Geografia for encouraging an authentic community of practice that closely simulates the duties of professional historians. [1] Barbas, H. and N.
