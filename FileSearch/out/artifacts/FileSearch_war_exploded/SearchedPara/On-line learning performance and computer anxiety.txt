 1. Introduction
With the incredibly fast paced advances being made in information technology, computers have emerged into the main-marked by increased familiarity with new concepts and more complete connections between their learning experience and prior knowledge.
Many users feel anxious when dealing with information systems, especially when initially interacting with them. In sociological and psychological aspects of human information behavior, computer anxiety is one of the most important subjects that has been commonly recognized by researchers and largely documented in the literature. Computer anxiety evidence for a relationship between computer anxiety and computer performance (e.g. Chou, 2001; Smith &amp; Caputi, 1989).

 on-line learning characteristics of the specific user population. 2. The proposed method 2.1. Grey system theory and grey relational analysis (GRA) GRA will not lead to a result that conflicts with quantitative analysis ( Liu &amp; Hong, 1997 ). the function x 0 ( k ) denotes the reference sequence, and x geometric proximity, the similarity between x 0 ( k ) and x tional degree between x 0 ( k ) and x 1 ( k ) is higher while that between x between x 0 ( k ) and x 2 ( k ) is more significant than that between x
The mathematics of GRA is derived from space theory. Let X be a factor set of grey relation, x x e X represents the reference sequence, and x i =( x i (1), x x ( k ) and x i ( k ) represent the respective numerals at point k for x number, then it can be defined as (Deng, 1989 ): The average value of c ( x 0 ( k ), x i ( k )) must satisfy the following four axioms:
Axiom 1. Norm interval: 0 &lt; c  X  x 0  X  k  X  ; x i x 0  X  k  X  ; x i  X  k  X 2;
Axiom 2. Duality symmetry: c  X  x 0  X  k  X  ; x i  X  k  X  X  X  c  X  x
Axiom 3. Wholeness: c  X  x i  X  k  X  ; x j  X  k  X  X   X  c  X  x j  X  k  X  ; x
Axiom 4. Approachability: c ( x 0 ( k ), x i ( k )) decreases when | x
If the four axioms are satisfied, c ( x 0 , x i ) is then designated as the grey relational grade in x c ( x 0 ( k ), x i ( k )) represents the grey relational coefficient between x i = 1,2,..., m ; k = 1,2,..., n .
 der is c ( x 0 , x j ) c ( x 0 , x i ), then the compared sequence x the compared sequence x i does. 2.2. Grey entropy ity (i.e. the distribution of the grey relational coefficient, c ( x information comprised in a given amount of signals. When drawing an analogy between human perception and a commu-associated to a given relative abundance vector p is measured by the quantity H
Let X be a sequence of grey relation, X  X  X  x 1 ; x 2 ; ... ; x fined as: where x j is characterized by attributive information.

The grey entropy possesses all axiomatic properties of Shannon entropy such as non-negativity, continuity, symmetry, utive information. The maximum of grey entropy can be obtained as: 2.3. Grey relation entropy (GRE) To combine the grey entropy with the GRA, the operation of grey relational coefficient must be modified as below: where R r represents the distribution of the grey relational coefficient; P value, representing the distribution density of the grey relational coefficient. Based on Eqs. (3) and (5), the GRE can be expressed as:
The GRE grade in x i corresponding to x 0 is then defined as:
The GRE can detect data regularity and characterize its asymptotic behavior. As shown in Fig. 2 , R point in the grey relational space. The grey relational order is c  X  x However, the grey relation entropy order is e  X  x 0 ; x 3
GRE method is more reasonable and reliable than traditional GRA. 2.4. Interrelated grade of the grey relation entropy
According to the axiom of wholeness, the GRE grades between any interrelated pair of sequences are unequal (i.e. e  X  x of GRE as the average GRE grade between any interrelated pair of sequences. It can be expressed as: ship between the corresponding pair of elements within a closed system. If the value of e (x
It is based on the concept of comparative magnitude for the correlation analysis. 3. Methodology 3.1. Subjects rience before the experiment.

The overall learning time and process were controlled and recorded by the system automatically. 3.2.2. On-line tests
The passing mark was 60 points and the testing time was restricted to 10 min for each unit test. 3.2.3. Computer anxiety scales
Beckers and Schmidt (2001) once proposed a six-factor model of computer anxiety. Based on their proposed model, we of 9 positive and 6 negative items. In addition to the six factors acceptable to me X .

To make the computer anxiety data available, we define the composite anxiety score (CAS) as the quotient obtained by the numerical value the more anxious a subject was in the perceived situation. It can be expressed as below: sents the positively-framed question item; q is a scale coefficient, q = 7.5. 3.2.4. Questionnaire survey five-point Likert scales ranging from  X  X  X ntirely disagree X  (score = 1) to  X  X  X ntirely agree X  (score = 5). 3.3. Procedure The empirical study used a post-test design and was implemented under a life-long learning project supported by the in Fig. 3 . 3.4. Data analysis responding classified group; for example, sequence x G  X  male  X 
Taking advantage of the GRE operation, we could obtain the corresponding GRE grades. These GRE grades were converted tive correlations among different classified groups. 4. Results 4.1. On-line learning achievements three groups: high-performance (scored more than 80), medium-performance (scored between 70 and 79), and low-perfor-group.

With respect to individual differences in learning achievements, the mean scores of the on-line tests were 72.72 72.43 (SD = 6.87) for young adult subjects aged under 44, 71.91 (SD = 8.35) for middle-aged subjects aged between 45 jects, and 74.13 (SD = 7.49) for the high-education subjects (see Table 2 ). 4.2.
