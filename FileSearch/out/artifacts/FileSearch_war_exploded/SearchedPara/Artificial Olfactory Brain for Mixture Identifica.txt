 We propose in the next section a dynamical rate model mimicki ng the AL X  X  signal conditioning function. By testing the model first with a generic Support Ve ctor Machine (SVM) classifier, we (Section 2). Then, we introduce a MB-like classifier to subst itute for the SVM and complete the binary learning signal (Section 3). Some concluding remark s are given in Section 4. 2.1 Insect Antennal Lobe Outline the AL output [1] shows that in fruit fly AL maps ORN output to a l ow dimensional feature space the class of nonlinear filters.

The AL is a dynamical network that is formed by the coupling of an excitatory neuron population (projectio n neurons, PNs) with an inhibitory one according to the receptor gene they express. The fruit fly has about 50 glomeruli as chemotopic glomeruli (rather than individual ORNs) so that the AL has di rect access to sensor resistances. setting is capable of evaluating the transient portion of th e sensory signal effectively. first to formulate the temporal gain due to AL processing. 2.2 The Model The model AL is comprised of a population of PNs that project f rom the AL to downstream pro-neurons is given by x N set of input signals S E formulation of these ideas is through a Wilson-Cowan-like p opulation model [11] X, Y  X  X  E, I } are time-independent weights quantifying the effect from u nits of type Y to units of type X .
