 Data Mining has made tremendous strides in the last decade. It is time to take data mining to the next level of contribu-tions, while continuing to innovate for the current main-stream market. We postulate that a fruitful future direction could be humane data mining: applications to benefit in-dividuals. The potential applications include personal data mining (e.g. personal health), enable people to get a grip on their world (e.g. dealing with the long tail of search), en-able people to become creative (e.g. inventions arising from linking non-interacting scientific literature), enable people to make contributions to society (e.g. education collabo-ration networks), and data-driven science (e.g. study eco-logical disasters, brain disorders). Rooting our future work in these (and similar) applications, will lead to new data mining abstractions, algorithms, and systems.
