 This paper presents a project realized in the domain of risk management at a financial services subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler. The project resulted in the implementation of an innovative KDD approach designed to optimize the collection efforts in automobile financing. In contrast with the conventional  X  X redit scoring X  -which is mainly geared towards assessing a customer X  X  credit worthiness at the time when she/he applies for a loan -in this project we followed the credit life cycle downstream and focused on how to best deal with delinquent customers in an actual credit portfolio. The resulting Data Mining solution was implemented in the finance company X  X  systems environment and in daily operations. Scoring, collections, credit risk, vehicle financing, automobile lending In traditional automotive lending  X  X ollections X  generally refers to all the processes, tools and activities carried out to deal with delinquent customers. Strategies to  X  X ollect the money X  usually extend from sending a letter, making phone calls to repossessing vehicles or any (sequential) combination thereof. The selection of the  X  X ight X  strategy or treatment though is a function of the individual riskiness of each customer at a particular point in time. In this project the business objective was to optimize the risk-adjusted allocation of delinquent customers/accounts to different collections treatments and levels of collector experience in a phone collections department. The department is divided into 3 collection groups for different risk levels (low, medium, high risk) and is staffed accordingly with collectors with different skills and experience (i.e. part time employees / full time employees / full time specialists). The most critical step in solving this business problem is assessing the individual riskiness of each newly or previously delinquent customer every day. A simple approach to the problem is to assign each customer to a different collection group based on his/her current state of  X  X ays delinquent X  or  X  X ays past due X  (DPD): If 0 &lt; DPD &lt;= 30 then Level 1 collections (low risk) else if 30 &lt; DPD &lt;= 60 then LevelIcollections (medium risk) else 60 &lt; DPD then Level-3-collections (high risk) The implicit assumption is that a customer X  X  payment ability and behavior is perfectly correlated with his/her current state of delinquency. Past experience shows that this approach may be a sub-optimal solution. The basic idea of the advanced approach was to use historical customer information, which is accessible and periodically updated, to develop a predictive decisioning system for the allocation of collection resources. Including recent information about a customer X  X  past payment behavior is especially valuable for this purpose. We assumed that more detailed and rich information on customer behavior would allow an earlier and more accurate determination of expected risks than only the DPD variable. The source of the data we used for this project was the billing system of the finance company which holds customer information about the contract (amount financed, monthly payment, term, etc.), about the vehicle (make, type, model, etc.) and about the current and past severity of delinquencies and payment behavior. In the first phase of model development we viewed the optimization of collections as a classification problem. Since the classes are not represented in the data, we had to derive a target variable by observing the  X  X ays-delinquent X -variable of a delinquent customer over the current and following 3 billing cycles (by moving the time window on historical data). Figure 1 illustrates the basic methodology used to derive the discrete values of the class variable from the  X  X ays delinquent X  variable in consecutive months. From a credit risk management standpoint there are two  X  X agic X  thresholds: The 30 and the 60 days delinquency line. The class variable aggregates the values of days delinquent in the following three months into one of three class values: 
Level 1: Today X  X  delinquent customer has to stay under the 30 days delinquency threshold in all of the following three months. Level 2: else. 
Level 3: ,Today X  X  delinquent customer violates the 60 days delinquency threshold at least in one of the following three months. Our first results applying C5.0 to learn a classification model delivered promising accuracy rates but also huge trees and rule sets, which were not suitable for a manual implementation in the software environment. Therefore, we researched alternative approaches that would not have this shortcoming. Our past experiences using M6.1 in other domains had shown less complexity in the resulting models. It is well known, however, that M6.1 and other regression tree approaches require a continuous-value target variable. So we had to go through the pre-processing phase again and define numerical target variables. Similar to the derivation of the class variable shown in figure 1, the continuous-value target variables were derived from the delinquency over the three following months, too. The applied method is illustrated in figure 2. 
Line A shows a linear transformation from days delinquent into a risk equivalent interval [O;l] for one particular month, Line B shows a non-linear transformation. Using a non-linear transformation takes into account that (from a credit risk management standpoint) moving from 2 to 5 days delinquent is not as bad as moving from 43 to 46 days delinquent. Aggregation and weighting of the three following months led to the final continuous-value target variables. 
For model development and evaluation we accessed 12 data sets of consecutive, monthly periods, each a snapshot of the current portfolio(non-delinquent accounts included). For each month the delinquent accounts were matched with their performance over the next three months. 
Using C5.0 [l] as a benchmark, we evaluated the performance of three alternative modeling techniques: Linear regression, regression tree M6.1 [2] and neural networks. Furthermore, we used three different continuous-value target variables based on linear and non-linear transformations (see figure 2). 
We ended up training a few hundred models with varying parameter settings during the whole model development process. 
In order to transform the continuous-value model outputs back results comparable to the results of 0.0. The 3 tables below show the predictive power (accuracy rates) of each modeling technique for each risk level (1, 2 and 3) as tested on unseen data Num 
Target I, II and III designate the alternative approaches we used to construct the continuous-value target variables. Trivial: 88.7 % Trivial: 55.6 % 
Summarizing the results we can say that the regression tree outperforms other solutions in Level-2 and Level-3, C5.0 shows the best accuracy in Level 1. Neural networks did not reach satisfactory results. When u&amp;g the trivial classification (DPD) as a benchmark, we saw that the new models outperformed it in the high-risk classes (Level-2 and Level-3). 
The results achieved were very sensitive to the type of continuous-value target variable used, a phenomenon worthy of further detailed analysis in the future. 
Based on the encouraging results of the evaluation process, the regression tree model was implemented into the phone collections workflow of the finance company. In addition to the good performance, the lower overall-complexity of this model type (compact tree with underlying linear regression models) met the constraints imposed by the need for manual programming during implementation in the collections software environment. The implementation of the predictive model was preceded by the implementation of a decision engine software. This software was  X  X nserted X  between the billing system and the collections system to generate a risk score for every delinquent account that is passed from the billing system into the collections system. Added functionality of this system gave us the ability to run competing collection strategies against each other on random samples of delinquent accounts. This methodology of controlled testing is generally known as champion-challenger testing in the finance industry. allocation strategy in order to allow a continuous monitoring of the decision model X  X  performance via such a champion -challenger comparisons. The experience after 12 months in operation shows a stable performance of the model and enough robustness to allow for score cut-off adjustments to address fluctuating workload and capacity constraints.
