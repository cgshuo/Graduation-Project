 Frank Lambert * 1. Introduction
There is no shortage of research that studies information seekers X  queries logged by various types of search engines. An incomplete but demonstrative list of such research might include Silverstein, Henzinger, Marais, and Moricz (1999), Spink,
Wolfram, Jansen, and Saracevic (2001), Beitzel, Jensen, Chowdhury, Frieder, and Grossman (2007), Chau, Fang, and Sheng (2005), Ross and Wolfram (2000), Wang, Berry, and Yang (2003), Pu, Chuang, and Yang (2002), Lau and Goh (2006) and Rieh and Xie (2006) . These and additional studies examine information seeking behaviours and information retrieval within on-line environments to address a number of research problems. However, the published Web search, community information (CI) seeking, and community informatics literature lack the analysis of large amounts of unobtrusively collected data such as those found in Web logs to determine conceptual types of CI that are sought through local online resources. This study at-tempts to begin to address this deficiency by examining a large purposive sample of 1 year X  X  worth of query data that re-sulted from hundreds of thousands of Web searches submitted by community information seekers through an online CI provider located in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, called mycommunityinfo.ca (MCI) and through the Web sites of its municipal government partners and clients. 1.1. Defining concepts related to Web queries, and community information and informatics
With queries being the primary units of analysis for this study, it is important to clarify what constitutes a query. It is in essence the final product of integrated parts as constructed by the information seeker. Or, as Spink and Jansen (2004) elab-orate,  X  X  X erms are the basic building blocks through which a Web searcher expresses their information problem when search-ing on a Web search engine. Single or multiple term and operators form a Web query X  (p. 55). While operators do not form any significant part of the queries in the data analyzed and presented in this paper, the single or multiple terms that con-stitute the queries are essential.

It is also worth examining some definitions and concepts related to the study of community information provision and the application of various information and communications technologies (ICTs) to facilitate access to this type of informa-tion. This is important to consider because of MCI X  X  particularly unique ICT model that relies primarily on keyword searching, an attribute seen very rarely in online CI providers. This has allowed hundreds of thousands queries targeted toward local online government and CI resources to be captured unobtrusively by MCI for analysis.

Community information (CI) and information and referral (IandR) have been used often interchangeably. Durrance (1984) , for instance, examined then X  X urrent scholarship in an attempt to distinguish between CI and IandR so that the parameters of the two services could be clarified and applied by information centres and especially public libraries. As a re-sult, Durrance identified a working definition of community information that works as an umbrella. First, CI must be recog-nized as a service. Then, two types of information may be provided by such a service: (1)  X  X  X urvival information such as that related to health, housing, income, legal protection, economic opportunity, political rights, etc. X  and (2)  X  X  X itizen action information, needed for effective participation as individual or as member of a group in the social, political, legal, economic process X  ( Donohue, 1976, p. 126 ; cited in Durrance, 1984b, p. 108).

Childers (1984) offers a broad definition of IandR: it facilitates  X  X  X he link between a person with a need and the resource or resources outside the library which can meet the need X  (p. 1). The resource or resources that Childers refers to  X  X  X onnotes any service, activity, individual, organization, information, or advice that may fulfill a need X  (p. 1). As Durrance (1984) alluded to above, Childers also acknowledged that there is some disagreement as to what IandR is and what constitutes legitimate
IandR activities. However, when compared to the first facet of CI services as defined by Donohue, Childers X  X  definition is not far off the mark. It is Donohue X  X  second facet of CI X  X  definition that implies some form of empowering an individual or group of individuals to participate more fully in civic life that distinguishes CI from IandR.

Prior totheintroduction ofcomputersasa tooltoaccess local information,a  X  X  X ommunity networkwas a sociological concept that described the pattern of communications and relationships in a community X  ( Schuler, 1996, p. 25 ). With the application of computer and Internet based technology, the definition of community network changed somewhat, but its intent remained the same. The computer based CNs that emerged in the 1990s were designed with the intention of being a tool to revitalize, strengthen, and expand existing people based community networks. The intent of CNs then was to  X  X  X dvance social goals, such as building communityawareness, encouraginginvolvement inlocal decision-making,or developingeconomic opportunitiesin disadvantaged communities X  by  X  X  X upporting smaller communities within the larger community and by facilitating the exchange of information between individuals and these smaller communities X  (Schuler, 1996, p. 25 ). They did this by: being run by and for the local community; address the information and communication needs of everyday life; foster equal access to new media; strengthen cohesion of the local community; be provided at no or little cost; and, refer to a geographic space containing community members in close physical proximity, rather than issue-oriented  X  X irtual com-munities X  or communities of interest. (Kubicek &amp; Wagner, 2002, p. 292 ).

To accomplish these goals, CNs were to offer what Schuler (1996) defines as electronic  X  X  X ne-stop shopping X  by offering a plethora of online resources to its users. While this was undeniably a worthwhile goal, this placed a tremendous strain on CNs X  finances in the 1990s, and it would, as predicted by Cohill (2000) , continue to be a significant challenge for some time.
However, much like the definition of CI offered above by Donohue, CNs offer a form of empowerment but just through a dif-ferent medium (electronic versus personal communication).

While most CNs offered access to the Internet through dial-up, the emergence and spread of high-speed, low cost Internet service providers (ISPs) led CNs to abandon this  X  X  X ne-stop shopping X  and server maintenance role ( Gurstein, 2000 ). CNs still ity of Internet services. Research and development in the area of information and communications technologies (ICTs) in the very late 1990s and going forward focused on creating hardware and software to find further cost efficiencies ( Gurstein, 2000). However, there seemed to be little concern over the potential users of these faster, better (based on one X  X  perception), and more affordable Web-based technologies, especially those for whom there were various educational, access, and finan-cial barriers. Community informatics concerns itself with the study of those individuals, groups, or communities who were and who are continuing to be excluded from the many potential benefits of ICTs (Gurstein, 2000 ). The Journal of Community
Informatics thus defines community informatics as the study and the practice of enabling communities with Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs). [Commu-nity informatics] seeks to work with communities towards the effective use of ICTs to improve their processes, achieve their objectives, overcome the  X  X  X igital divides X  that exist both within and between communities, and empower commu-nities and citizens in the range of areas of ICT application including for health, cultural production, civic management, e-governance among others. (Accessed January 25, 2007, from http://www.ci-journal.net/index.php/ciej ).

Fundamental to how community informatics studies how ICTs can help communities realize their social, economic, polit-ical, or cultural goals on the path to community empowerment is access to ICTs  X  X  X ince without at least minimal access, little can be accomplished X  (Gurstein, 2000, p. 3 ). Thus the focus for community informatics is still, like the study of CI, on how information can empower individuals and groups of individuals. However, the role of ICTs as a tool, especially related to on-line access and issues of the so-called  X  X  X igital Divide, X  are an added facet of concern to researchers. 1.2. Conceptual framework for this study Broder X  X  (2002) model for IR augmented for the World Wide Web (WWW) provides a helpful framework for this study.
Unlike the classic IR model, the augmented model recognizes that human X  X omputer interaction factors and cognitive as-pects play a role in Web searching. These additional attributes take into account that the information seeker X  X  information need is associated with some task. As a result,  X  X  X his need is verbalized (usually mentally, not out loud) and translated into a query posed to a search engine. X  ( Broder, 2002, p. 4 ). What makes Broder X  X  model useful in this paper X  X  context is the link of a verbalized mentally articulated information need based on some task that is submitted through a Web-based tool to the def-initions above of CI and IandR as resources for solving everyday information needs. Since MCI is a Web search engine with a community focus for information sources, the data that result from its activities (captured query data) become an important source for attempting to model online community information needs. While Broder defines the needs behind the query that is posed to the search engine as one of three types (navigational, informational, and transactional), this study X  X  goal is to move beyond a cursory classification of the queries collected by MCI based on these criteria (cf. Broder, 2002 ; more recently seeker X  X  task and information need, further conceptual categorization was required to address the research questions pre-sented in Section 4. This further categorization is intended to make a contribution not only to the Web search literature, but also to the community informatics literature by providing the first empirical study that demonstrates how and for what purpose information and communications technologies (ICTs) are used as a tool to meet the various local information needs by the communities it has been designed to serve. While the findings are limited to the Middlesex X  X ondon and Waterloo regions in Southwestern Ontario, this study intends to demonstrate that using a centralized approach to online CI access via the WWW may be a disservice to its users. Additionally, the findings demonstrate how proper analysis of such data may improve the informational content and overall design of municipal government Web sites. 2. Rationale for the study Despite the limitations of Web log query analysis as a methodology (e.g. Spink &amp; Jansen, 2004; Thelwall, Vaughan, &amp;
Bj X rneborn, 2005 ) that are dealt with in further detail later in this paper, it  X  X  X an reveal first-hand and real-world behaviour and interests of users. It enables researchers to better understand Web site user behaviours and the service quality that the Web site provides. It also can be used to optimize the effectiveness of information services. X  (Zhang, Wolfram, Wang, Hong, &amp;
Gillis, 2008, p. 1934 ). The observation of first-hand and real-world behaviour and interests of users in Web log data is pos-related to Web search behaviours and interests as well as the effectiveness of its information services and those of its partner government Web sites (City of London and County of Middlesex municipal governments and London Police Service) and its one client (Region of Waterloo municipal government). This study addresses Spink and Jansen X  X  (2004) assertion that  X  X  X ur-ther single Web site studies are needed to replicate and extend the previous studies X  cited by the authors and other studies that have been published since 2004 (p. 25). Additionally, this study addresses Durrance and Pettigrew X  X  (2002) concerns about the lack of comprehensive data and it subsequent analysis regarding citizens X  use of networked CI services. One of the benefits of this current study is that it analyzes a large purposive sample of the query data from all of the single Web sites mentioned above through the use of specially designed search bars rather than focusing on only a single Web site. Be-hind these Web sites a Google search appliance is used for crawling, indexing, and retrieval purposes. Additionally, MCI uses customized data collection software created by the City of London X  X  Technology Services Division to archive these data from these Web sites in a Microsoft Access database even though these Web sites are hosted on different servers. Thus, all incom-ing query data from all Web sites are treated the same, facilitating data processing and analysis procedures. 2.1. Background  X  a brief history of mycommunityinfo.ca
MCI was chosen as a case site because its information retrieval (IR) model of delivering online CI has been shaped and designed purposely to be a simple, innovative, cost-effective, and potentially sustainable approach to providing this infor-mation during a time when CI providers are faced with the challenges of remaining financially viable (e.g. Cohill, 2000; Gur-stein, 2000; Hearn, Kimber, Lennie, &amp; Simpson, 2005; Rideout &amp; Reddick, 2005 ). MCI X  X  service has been available to approximately 942,000 residents in 24 urban and rural municipalities located in the Middlesex X  X ondon region and the
Region of Waterloo since 2003 X 2004 ( Cummings, 2004 ). These rural and urban municipalities are located in the geographic region of Southwestern Ontario, Canada, between Detroit, Michigan, and Toronto, Ontario. Additionally, MCI offers ever-expanding single point access to the online information resources of not only local non-profit community organizations and municipal governments, but also it allows immediate access to the online information resources of the Ontario provin-cial and the Canadian federal governments. MCI X  X  approach may thus prove to be an affordable and effective model for other communities to consider as an alternative method of delivering information to community members (cf. Lambert, 2008 ).
MCI was conceived first in 1999 when representatives of various ministries, departments, and agencies from the muni-cipal, provincial, and federal governments met to address the question of how these groups could provide  X  X  X  cost-effective integration of information service offerings from three levels of government X  (Cummings, 2004, p. 1) in the Middlesex X  X on-don region of Southwestern Ontario. The end result of these meetings (Fig. 1 ) culminated in the creation of an online com-munity information portal that avoids the traditional, often considerably more expensive and difficult to maintain, networked directory model of organized, static links to government and non-profit organization information resources.
The drawback to the directory model, such as that exemplified by the North American-wide 211 service, is that the links have to be monitored and maintained on an ongoing basis by a complement of paid staff. While this model may be useful to many
CI seekers, the excessive control inherent in systems that rely on a directory approach may be a potential disservice to their users. The online CI directory model assumes primarily a search method where the information seeker does not make a formal expression of information needs but rather navigates Web sites through the chain of links found in the Web sites X  pages.  X  X  X owever, when some specific information is searched, this point-and-click access paradigm is unpractical, and the effectiveness of the results strongly depends on the starting page X  (Herrera-Viedma &amp; Pasi, 2006, p. 511 ). Instead of devoting its resources to maintaining links and metadata, MCI relies for indexing and retrieval purposes on search engine technology that targets specifically local public sector Web sites through its own index. Queries aimed at only provincial and federal government Web sites can also be launched from this one Web site through the publicly available Google search engine.

On July 31, 2003, the automated collection of queries submitted through MCI X  X  Google search appliance, and of queries sent to the public version of Google via MCI, began, with the query data being logged in a Microsoft Access database ( Cum-mings, 2004 ). As of early 2007, 223 local municipal governments, their associated agencies, and local non-profit community organizations in London and Middlesex County (198) and in the Region of Waterloo (25) have had their Web sites indexed and made accessible through MCI X  X  search appliance. 3. Review of related work 3.1. Community information seeking and uses
Within the context of community information seeking research, Durrance and Pettigrew (2002) note that there is a lack of comprehensive data regarding citizens X  use of networked CI services. In-depth examinations are also lacking regarding cit-izen X  X  information behaviour in networked CI environments. This study has been designed to help begin to fill the voids iden-tified by Durrance and Pettigrew.

There is little literature that focuses exclusively on online CI Web searching or seeking. Any studies that do provide in-sight on this type of information searching do so within contexts that have different foci. Closely related literature includes
Bishop, Tidline, Shoemaker, and Salela (1999) who examined community information use and computer access of a low-in-come locale in the United States populated primarily by African-Americans. Their sample group ( n = 34) reported through household interviews seven subject areas of information ranked in priority order based on their open responses that they would like to have access to online: community services and activities, resources for children, healthcare, education, employ-ment, crime and safety and general reference tools such as dictionaries. Similarly, through the use of online surveys posted on NorthStarNet in Northeastern Illinois, Three Rivers Free-Net (TRFN) in Pittsburgh, PA, and CascadeLink in Portland, OR,
Durrance and Pettigrew (2002) discerned 20 community information categories of interest from their respondents ( n = 197). The alphabetical list of categories of digital CI needs included: Business Health Computer and technical information Housing Education Library operations and services Employment opportunities Local events Financial support Local history and genealogy Government and civic Local information (local accommodations, community features) Parenting Local news (weather, traffic, school closures) Recreation and hobbies Organizations and groups Sale, exchange, or donation of goods Other people (both local and beyond the community) Social services
While the data collection methods used by Bishop et al. (1999) and Durrance and Pettigrew (2002) were certainly appropri-ate, neither study may claim that the findings are generalizable. This study is limited too in its generalizability as it focuses on two small regions within Canada. Additionally, this study does not consider navigational information seeking as informa-tion seekers go from link to link within Web sites such as those owned by the municipal governments introduced in this paper until they reach their ultimate information destination. However, for this study large samples of the units of analysis may be quantified, conceptualized, and then ranked. This is a distinct advantage that the studies above were not able to ex-ploit. The conceptual meaning of these queries may be compared then from within and between the communities within these regions to give a more comprehensive picture of online everyday information seeking through Web search from a rel-atively large portion of the province of Ontario X  X  population. 3.2. Web log analysis
This study fits well within the research that studies search engine log files where data are recorded about what the user is actually seeking as represented by the actual keyword queries that the user submits (Thelwall et al., 2005). Research pub-lished on the analysis of Web query logs has focused on querying behaviours through either commercial search engines, search engines that are used exclusively for searching through a Web site, or for searching through library OPACs. Silverstein et al. (1999) examined a data set recorded over 43 days from the AltaVista search engine comprising over 900 million total requests. Their interest lay in determining which queries were most common, the average length of queries, how many que-ries were submitted during an individual session and, especially, correlations between query terms and other field values.
Spink et al. (2001) conducted a similar study involving over one million query logs (531,416 of which were unique) sent to the Excite search engine on one day by 211,063 users. They examined the number of queries submitted per identified user, measured the change in unique queries submitted by each identified user, the number of results pages viewed, and whether multi-term queries used advanced search features such as Boolean operators. Rieh and Xie (2006) analyzed also a data set of 313 search sessions from the Excite search engine to characterize facets of query reformulation and identify patterns of mul-tiple query reformulation in Web searching. Their goal was to explore  X  X  X he ways in which search engines can support query reformulation more effectively in Web searching X  (p. 752) by using Saracevic X  X  stratified interaction model as an analytical framework ( Rieh &amp; Xie, 2006 ).

Following the parsing of multi-term queries, Ross and Wolfram (2000) used the frequency of binary term co-occurrence to determine facets of multi-term queries without having to look at every query. This was a bottom-up grounded theory method with no a priori categorization beforehand. Pu et al. (2002) used this same approach to develop their subject taxon-omy for the automatic classification of Web query terms into broad subject categories. Beitzel et al. X  X  study (2007) involved the analysis of the Web query logs of the America Online (AOL) Web search service. However, the authors used a longitudinal analysis  X  X  X o examine static and topical changes (in querying) over longer periods such as days, weeks, and months X  ( Beitzel et al., 2007, p. 167 ). Additionally, the authors  X  X  X nalyzed the queries representing different topics using a topical categoriza-tion of (their) query stream X  in an effort to determine how querying behaviour for some categories would either change or remain static over time (p. 167).

Chau, Fang, and Sheng X  X  study (2005) focused on keyword queries that were submitted through the Utah state govern-ment Web site. The authors X  goal was not only to determine the characteristics of queries that were submitted through this Web site search engine but also to compare those same queries to those submitted through general-purpose search engines.
They determined  X  X  X hat Web users behave similarly when using a Web site engine and a general-purpose search engines in terms of the average number of terms per query and the average number of result pages viewed per sessions( sic ) X  (p. 1374).
However, the users of the Utah state government Web site search engine submitted, on average, fewer queries per session than users of general-purpose search engines. Additionally, Utah government Web site users use different sets of terms and topics in their queries compared to general-purpose search engine users.

Lau and Goh (2006) analyzed 641 991 queries from the Nanyang Technological University OPAC to determine what caused failed search sessions. Their objective was to identify areas of improvement for the OPAC to improve users X  search experiences with the OPAC through the use primarily of failure analysis. As a result, the authors recommend improvements to the OPAC through enhancements to interactive query reformulation, browsing, and context-sensitive assistance. 4. Research questions
What should be noticed from this literature review is that Web log analysis used as a research method to analyze Web search needs and behaviours has continued to evolve in innovative and informative ways. Web log analysis X  X  applicability as a methodological tool for determining how CI seekers use online resources should continue to be considered seriously as an approach for improving the quality of and access to local information, regardless of the design of the online CI provider X  X  electronic infrastructure.
 This study thus attempts to address the following research questions:
What types of conceptual CI are being sought in an online environment through MCI X  X  service approach and the Web sites of its partners? Are there differences in the types of CI being sought between MCI and its partner Web sites?
Will the collection and analysis of these data present findings different than those of other researchers who rely primarily on other methodological approaches?
The findings of this study will provide a perspective of CI seeking that may make other online CI organizations and mu-nicipal governments consider further the design and content of their respective Web sites. Additionally, this study and other studies that may employ a similar methodological approach may lead to the further consideration of theoretical issues of user warrant versus literary warrant concerning the creation of new or additional taxonomies for community and social ser-vices information. 5. Methods 5.1. Attributes of mycommunityinfo.ca X  X  query logs MCI supplied voluntarily their complete Web query log covering August 2005 X  X uly 2006 in a Microsoft Access database.
The full year X  X  worth of cleaned data were analyzed to provide a snapshot of the local online information inquiries of the communities under examination. The following gives a description of the different attributes of the Web log data and then details how the data was processed and analyzed.

The Microsoft Access database table that captures the Web query data is comprised of eleven attributes, with each attribute recording different aspects of each query event. Table 1 gives brief descriptions of the relevant attributes in the
Access database table. These descriptions are necessary because a number of these fields play a major role in data prepara-tion and analysis. Additionally, it is likely that the Web logs of many other Web sites will not contain the same types of attributes as MCI X  X  customized log. This is because the Access table is a customized, in-house solution for capturing these data. 5.2. The processing and analysis of mycommunityinfo.ca X  X  query logs
The MCI query logs, like those in Ross and Wolfram X  X  study (2000) , included many examples of identical queries being submitted by the same session identifier in succession. This was due to users submitting a request to view the next page of hits for the originally submitted query within each session. For this study a  X  X ind duplicates X  query was used in Access to retrieve all of the duplicate session numbers. Then, another  X  X ind duplicates X  query was used to group all of the duplicate query text within each session with duplicate identifiers that resulted from additional page views. All but one of the identical additional queries within each session were deleted manually to create a new Microsoft Access table of  X  X  X lean X  queries for frequency analysis. Similar to Ross and Wolfram (2000) and Wang et al. (2003) universal resource locators (URLs) and email addresses were not included in the analysis. Once  X  X  X leaned, X  the MCI and municipal government query data were processed again using another separate  X  X ind duplicates X  query in Microsoft Access. The final process was refined further by focusing on the respective Web site through which the queries were submitted by using the site field ( Table 1 ).

Following the parsing of multi-term queries, Ross and Wolfram (2000) used the frequency of binary term co-occurrence to determine facets of multi-term queries without having to look at every query. This was a bottom-up grounded theory method with no a priori categorization beforehand. Pu et al. (2002) used this same approach to develop their subject taxon-omy for the automatic classification of Web query terms into broad subject categories. In this study, an empirical approach is used to gather and group the most frequently occurring top 100 cleaned queries from each Web site based on their manifest or visible surface content (Babbie, 2008 ) Several attempts then were made to conceive and construct a list of categories that were well grounded in the Web log data based on the queries X  conceptually similar latent content to give the queries some conceptual meaning (Babbie, 2008 ). This was done to provide a valid and reliable list of categories that could define what sorts of community information people are searching for online. Once the list of categories was deemed sufficient to ensure mutual exclusivity, a copy of this list along with a representative systematic sample of the top 100 most frequently occurring queries from each Web site was given to a Ph.D. student to classify. This was done to determine first the content validity of the categories by ensuring that the queries covering the range of meanings included in the conceptual categories were as clearly understandable and mutually exclusive as possible (Babbie, 2008 ). The second purpose of this exercise was to test the reliability of the categories for coding the query data by measuring the rate of intercoder agreement between my coding and that of the Ph.D. student ( Babbie, 2008 ). The end result was an intercoder rate of agreement of 89%. When the coding of the queries using the sub-categories is taken into consideration, the rate of agreement dropped slightly to 85%. Following a discussion, some minor changes were made to the wording of the categories. The final list of categories is shown in Figs. 2 and 3 . 6. Findings 6.1. Basic statistical findings of the mycommunityinfo.ca Web log data
Over the course of the 1 year under study, 733,331 raw query events were captured in the Microsoft Access database de-signed by Technology Services Division, City of London. Following the cleansing of the queries, the Web sites contributed the breakdown of data for analysis shown in Table 2 .

Considering the number of raw query events in relation to the total number of cleaned queries in column one of Table 2 , 48% of all events that were in MCI X  X  query log were users requesting views of additional pages of  X  X  X its X  returned by the search engine. Table 2 also shows that municipal Web sites, with the exception of County of Middlesex and the more top-ically specialized London Police Services Web site, were queried far more as potential sources of local information compared to the more diverse MCI Web site that indexes 223 Web sites from London X  X iddlesex and Region of Waterloo.

The disproportionate total of MCI-Middlesex X  X ondon X  X  top 100 most frequently occurring queries relative to that of the other Web sites needs to be noted. This anomaly is due to MCI X  X  use of Life Events bundles number of actively hyperlinked keywords and very short keyword phrases that have been embedded in Life Events pages to offer the CI seeker the option of launching a search of MCI X  X  index if the particular Life Event does not contain the information that is needed. Once the hyperlinked keyword or keyword phrase is clicked on, a search is launched in the same way as typing the actual query and clicking on the  X  X  X o! X  button. Sixty-nine out of seventy Life Event bundle keywords were exact matches to sixty-nine of the queries that appeared in the top 100 of MCI-Middlesex X  X ondon X  X  Web log data. These Life Events may be an attractive alternative for CI organization and searching rather than relying solely on either keyword searching or a directory of fixed links. 6.1.1. Mean number of terms per query
The mean number of terms used per query for the top 100 most frequently occurring queries and for all cleaned queries was calculated to compare some of the descriptive statistical findings of past Web log studies to this study in an effort to determine if CI seekers in Southwestern Ontario tend to use more or fewer words to find the information being sought. For the top 100 most sought queries, the proportion of multi-term queries ranged widely based on the Web site used.
MCI-Middlesex X  X ondon had the highest proportion of multi-term queries at 49%. Again, this was influenced by the use of active hyperlinked keywords and short keyword phrases in MCI-Middlesex X  X ondon X  X  Life Events pages. While at least 50% of all top 100 queries are composed of only one word, the average number of words or terms that form queries in Table 2 are fewer than those reported in other studies. Wang et al. (2003) report an average of two words per query submitted by users. Beitzel et al. (2007) found over one week in December 2003 that users submitted on average 2.2 terms per query ses-sion. When this was expanded to six months, the average number of query terms increased slightly to 2.7 terms. Wang, Ber-ry, and Yang X  X  (2003) and Beitzel et al. X  X  (2007) studies match more closely the mean number of terms per query for all queries shown in Table 2. Additionally, the average  X  X  X opular query X  length in Beitzel et al. X  X  (2007) study was 1.7 terms per session for the two time periods they examined. While Beitzel et al. (2007) do not define what constitutes a  X  X  X opular query, X  an average of 1.7 terms per session is the closest match in the Web log literature to the findings for the top 100 que-ries presented in Table 2 . 6.2. Online community information seeking in London X  X iddlesex and Region of Waterloo
The sections that follow highlight some of the more interesting conceptual categories that emerged from the Web query log data collected from MCI X  X  Web site and the City of London, County of Middlesex, Region of Waterloo, and London Police
Service Web sites. The primary goal of this analysis is to present empirical evidence of actual Web-based CI inquiries that focus on the geographic region of Southwestern Ontario. Within each of the select categories, an examination of the CI inqui-ries that emerged from the individual Web sites is presented to demonstrate how CI inquiries may differ between munici-palities or smaller regions within Southwestern Ontario. Not every single category from all Web sites will be discussed; ysis of CI seeking in Southwestern Ontario is considered within the context of the design of online CI portals and the design of CI taxonomies.
 The conceptual categories that emerged from the queries were divided into major and minor categories ( Figs. 2 and 3 ).
Within the major categories, more specific sub-categories also emerged. Minor categories were either very Web site specific (e.g.  X  X  X pecial X  Middlesex County) or could not be categorized. Categories were considered  X  X  X inor X  if their proportion of all of the most frequently occurring queries was equal to or less than the percentages of the lowest percentage subcategory (cf. Tables 3 and 4).

As may be seen in Tables 5 X 10 , each individual Web site X  X  conceptual categories may be ranked, showing the conceptual  X  X  X opularity X  of the submitted queries rather than relying simply on an alphabetical list to report findings (e.g. Durrance &amp;
Pettigrew, 2002 ). This gives some sense as to what really matters to information seekers as they search for information on-line to help them address their everyday inquiries.
 6.2.1.  X  X  X ecreation, Entertainment, and Leisure  X  as the most frequently sought local information
Nearly one in every five queries submitted through the six combined CI-based Web sites pertained to this conceptual cat-egory ( Table 4 ). Users of particularly the City of London Web site were the largest absolute contributors of queries pertaining to  X  X  X ecreation, Entertainment, and Leisure. X  This is hardly surprising since most of the overall queries came from the City of
London Web site to begin with. However, as Table 5 shows, this category also had the largest impact on the types of CI sought through the City of London Web site.

Even though the proportion of queries devoted to the  X  X  X ecreation, Entertainment, and Leisure X  category is quite high, there are often considerable differences within its sub-categories. Queries related to  X  X  X olidays X  focused on finding informa-tion about statutory holidays (e.g.  X  X  X ictoria day, X   X  X  X anada day X ) and events usually associated with them. Note that MCI-Re-gion of Waterloo Web site is used more frequently than the municipal Region of Waterloo Web site to find this particular type of information. However, MCI-Region of Waterloo will search all of the lower-tier municipal Web sites (e.g. the cities of Kitchener, Waterloo, and Cambridge, the townships of North Dumfries, Wellesley, Wilmot, and Woolwich, and the Region of Waterloo) all at once. This will thus give the MCI-Region of Waterloo user a greater chance of finding information pertain-ing to  X  X  X olidays X  than if they only searched the Region of Waterloo Web site. City of London CI searchers were the largest absolute contributors to queries concerning  X  X  X olidays X  but as a proportion of the top 100 cleaned queries submitted through the City of London Web site, the percentage is quite small (3.7%). Surprisingly, London Police Service had a very large pro-portion of queries (nearly 30%) that focused on  X  X  X ecreation, Entertainment, and Leisure. X  However, all of these  X  X  X ecreation,
Entertainment, and Leisure X  queries fall into the more specific subcategory of  X  X  X hopping. X  These information seekers wanted to know where and when police auctions were being held and used  X  X  X uction X  and  X  X  X uctions X  as the first and second most popular queries, respectively.

It was unanticipated that  X  X  X ecreation, Entertainment, and Leisure X  information would be the most sought after type of local information. Despite what may be considered more  X  X  X erious X  categories (e.g.  X  X  X ork X ,  X  X  X ousing and Shelter X ,  X  X  X ealth X ), residents from the two geographic regions served by MCI and its partner Web sites seem to place some priority with seeking information related to leisure activities. Considering the time pressures that working people often feel, this makes sense since  X  X  X he average daily time spent on paid work, housework and other unpaid household duties (including child care) for those aged 25 X 54 (in Canada) has increased steadily over the past two decades, rising from 8.2 h in 1986 to 8.8 h in 2005 X  ( Marshall, 2006, pp. 5 and 7 ). This overall increase in work of all kinds is due solely to the amount of paid work hours
Canadian workers perform (Marshall, 2006 ). Thus trying to find leisure activities within close proximity to where the MCI and municipal Web site CI seekers live takes some precedence. 6.2.2. Job seeking
Notwithstanding the emphasis on searching for recreational activities in Southwestern Ontario, finding information about employment is still a much sought after information-seeking category (Table 3 ). Even with reasonably low and declining unemployment rates in Middlesex X  X ondon and Region of Waterloo during 2005 and 2006 (6.8% and 6.2% for the former, respectively, and 5.7% and 5.2% for the latter, respectively), there was still a large focus on finding employment information (City of Kitchener, 2007; LEDC, xxxx ). There is quite a contrast in the percentage of queries devoted to finding employment between the very rural County of Middlesex (which surrounds City of London) and City of London. While finding information about  X  X  X ork X  by querying the City of London Web site was the second most popular category, it was the primary type of inquiry for County of Middlesex (Table 7 ) which surrounds City of London. 6.2.3. Health  X  X  X atters  X 
A disproportionate number of the queries (&gt;50%) related to  X  X  X ealth X  actually come from the Region of Waterloo muni-cipal government Web site, and thus ranks as the fifth most sought local information inquiry ( Table 9 ). The majority of Re-gion of Waterloo X  X  health-related queries were concerned with virulent diseases (influenza and its iterations,  X  X est Nile, X  and  X  X andemic X ) and two narrow public health issues ( X  X moking X  and  X  X ood safety, X ). A closer examination of the Region of Water-loo Web site X  X  main page reveals a link called  X  X  X andemic Influenza Planning X  (http://www.region.waterloo.on.ca/web/re-gion.nsf/fmFrontPage?OpenForm . Accessed June 30, 2007). Clicking on this link opens a Web site in a new browser window called Waterloo Region Pandemic Influenza Planning (http://www.waterlooregionpandemic.ca/en/index.shtml . Accessed June 30, 2007). However, prior to August 18th, 2006, this link did not exist on the Region of Waterloo Web site. Confirmation of this fact is possible by using the Internet Archive Wayback Machine (http://www.archive.org/web/web.php . Accessed July 1, 2007). Examining past versions of the Region of Waterloo Web site using the Wayback Machine for the time span during which the Web log data were collected did not reveal any links to the Waterloo Region Pandemic Influenza Planning Web site let alone links to Web pages within the Region of Waterloo Web site that addressed pandemic planning or virulent disease.
Due to the relatively large number of health-related queries in MCI X  X  Web logs, the Region of Waterloo Web site may be per-ceived to be a very important source of health information for residents of Region of Waterloo. However, this perception could be attributed to poor design of the main Web page. 6.2.4.  X  X  X unicipal Government Business  X 
For the County of Middlesex, City of London, and Region of Waterloo, the proportions of queries that pertain to finding information concerning  X  X  X unicipal Government Business X  are very similar. This similarity in the proportion of queries be-tween the different Web sites for  X  X  X unicipal Government Business X  indicates that, regardless of whether an online informa-tion seeker lives in either a primarily rural or a primarily urban setting, he or she relies on the World Wide Web to a fairly significant extent to find information about his or her government X  X  operations and policies. Some examples of these infor-mation inquiries are concerned with  X  X  X ylaws X ,  X  X  X oning X ,  X  X  X evelopment charges X ,  X  X  X ocial services X , and other topics that are too numerous to list.
 MCI-Middlesex X  X ondon and MCI-Region of Waterloo were used rarely if at all to find information concerning  X  X  X unicipal
Government Business. X  When CI seekers are looking for information about their local government in an online environment, they seem to prefer to use the most direct and relevant source: municipal government Web sites. Also, MCI-Middlesex X  X on-don and MCI-Region of Waterloo index more than one municipal government X  X  Web site. A local information seeker looking for information from his/her municipality would not necessarily be interested in the information that pertains to other municipalities. 6.2.5.  X  X  X eographic Information  X  seeking in Southwestern Ontario
While  X  X  X eographic Information X  only makes up 3% of the queries submitted through the City of London Web site, only three queries were used to make up the total frequency for this category:  X  X  X ap, X   X  X  X aps, X  and  X  X  X ity map. X  This focused querying, like Region of Waterloo Web site X  X  experience with health information pertaining to virulent disease, says something about Web site design and how users are interacting with it through its links to information sources such as maps. 7. Discussion The findings presented above show that the types of CI categories being sought by CI seekers in London X  X iddlesex and
Region of Waterloo are, in many instances, considerably different between these communities. These categories are different also from those discovered and presented by past research. This not only reveals interesting trends in CI seeking, but it also offers insight into the design of CI Web sites and municipal government Web sites. It raises questions about the effectiveness of adopting a standardized approach to providing online CI amongst different communities. This standardized approach that is used by a variety of CI and information and referral services such as the 211 service those communities a disservice.
 7.1. Emergence of help-seeking mismatches
Based on the queries that were collected and analyzed for this study, there is an impression that a relatively large number of Web searchers using the municipal government Web sites presented in this paper seem to perceive that online govern-ment-based information resources are a relatively important source for  X  X  X ecreation, Entertainment, and Leisure X  informa-tion. For instance,  X  X  X ovies X ,  X  X  X estaurants X ,  X  X  X ars X ,  X  X  X hopping X , and  X  X  X alls X  are all examples of very frequently occurring navigational and informational queries that are part of this category submitted specifically through municipal government
Web sites. However, after querying personally the City of London Web site using each of those same keywords, no hits re-lated to these queries were returned. The City of London Web site does not contain any Web documents that pertain to many of these activities. Those who are querying City of London X  X  Web site in particular might be experiencing what Dewdney and
Harris (1992) define as a help-seeking mismatch where  X  X  X he types of help that might be expected from an agency are not those which it provides. X  (p. 23) Thus, users looking for this information in Middlesex X  X ondon are not using the best source to retrieve this type of information (MCI-Middlesex X  X ondon does index Web sites related to tourism). If this is indeed a com-mon practice with other similar government Web sites, municipal governments should evaluate how their Web sites are used more closely to help minimize this unintentional information barrier. 7.2. Is health information seeking still an important Web search activity?
The low ranking for  X  X  X ealth X  information seeking was somewhat unexpected as searching for health or medical related information is generally a relatively popular Internet activity in Canada. While a direct comparison cannot be made using this study X  X  data, Statistics Canada X  X  2005 survey reports that searching for health or medical related information was the sixth most popular Internet activity of individual Canadians (Statistics Canada, Nov. 1, 2006 ). Additionally, there is a signif-icant body of information science literature that emphasizes consumer health information seeking on the WWW. For instance, Harris, Wathen, and Chan (2005) cite two studies that suggest anywhere from 20% to 80% of the population of the
United States with Internet access seek health information. Gillaspy (2005) found contradictory studies concerning the pro-portion of the population that use the Internet for finding health information. Gillaspy cites the same Pew Internet Project report as Harris, Wathen, and Chan where 80% of the population reported they use the Internet to seek health information.
However, a study from the Center for Studying Health Care Change reported that only 16% of the United States X  population used the Internet to find health information. Gillaspy considers these data within the context of various factors that may affect the provision of consumer health information in public libraries. While Gillaspy wonders which study is the most accurate, she concludes that  X  X  X n fact, in terms of providing consumer health information in public libraries, it may not mat-ter. Adults learn at the point of need, when learning is relevant to their life situation, and certainly health issues become pertinent to almost everyone at some point in their lives X  (p. 482). Spink and Jansen X  X  (2004) studies confirmed what was found in this study; that only a small percentage of Web queries are medical or health-related. Considering the plethora of health information Web sites available on the WWW, it is very possible that MCI and the municipal government Web sites are not considered to be good or even necessary resources despite the number of local health-related Web sites that MCI indexes. 7.3. Effectiveness and importance of well designed home pages
The City of London has an impressive number of online maps available through its Web site, including an outstanding easy to use interactive map of the city available to find addresses, provide aerial photographs, find schools, parks and rec-reation centres, points of interest, and even assessment parcels and electoral wards, among other features. ( City of London, xxxx). As a result, it is not difficult to assume that this collection of geographic resources could be a fairly popular tool for finding  X  X  X eographic Information X  about the city. However, the City of London Web site also has a rather noticeable link to this interactive map on its main page. The question that is raised, then, is why are keyword queries being submitted through the Web site to find maps when a relatively prominent link is provided on the main page? This, like Region of Waterloo X  X  rather prominent link to its pandemic planning Web site, may be an example of the same issue articulated by Herrera-Vied-ma and Pasi (2006) cited earlier in this study: that the likelihood of a successful search for information based on a point-and-click access paradigm is dependent largely on the design and related information provided on the starting Web page. Since such a relatively large number of queries are related to  X  X  X eographic Information, X  and more specifically to maps, it is pos-sible that an unsuccessful point-and-click access paradigm is being demonstrated. Without Web site navigation data related to the number of times users have actually clicked on the maps link, this theory cannot be tested. However, further research into this aspect of human X  X omputer interaction may reveal aspects of online searching behaviour that should be taken into account in the design of Web sites.
 The respective municipal governments mentioned above might find it interesting to know how their citizens rely on their
Web sites to find information concerning the municipalities X  operations, policies, and responsibilities. Municipal govern-ments have followed the lead of the federal and provincial governments in offering more services and information through the WWW. This has occurred despite the fact that municipal governments already tended to interact with a country X  X  citi-zens much more closely than a national government. This type of online interactivity between a municipality X  X  residents and local government should also enhance residents X  perception that municipal governments still tend to be better at delivering services compared to the provincial or federal governments (cf. Canadian Centre for Management Development, 1999; Erin
Research, Inc., 1998 ). 7.4. Implicaton of this study X  X  findings and the findings of other similar studies on information organization
There are some but few similarities between Durrance and Pettigrew X  X  categories and the major categories that emerged from the MCI Web log data. Most importantly, like Durrance and Pettigrew X  X  findings (2002) , the categories in Tables 3 and 4  X  X  X re markedly different from those traditionally used to classify CI needs X  (p. 2). This should hopefully start a dialogue about possible changes to Sales X  X  Taxonomy of Human Services (1994) and its more current iteration, the AIRS/INFOLINE Taxonomy of
Human Services , since so many of the more than 8,500 controlled vocabulary terms contained in the taxonomy are not re-motely similar when related to MCI X  X  conceptual CI inquiries (Sales, 2003 ).

The top 100 most frequently occurring queries from six Web sites formed the basis for the categorization and subsequent discussion of online CI inquiries. This means that only six hundred queries represented 21% of the tens of thousands of dis-tinct queries submitted through MCI and its partner municipal Web sites over the course of 1 year. This demonstrates a remarkable conceptual consistency in local information seeking that may be boiled down to the 20 main conceptual cate-gories shown in Table 3 . Why then are bulky and often complex taxonomies needed to organize online CI directories when their controlled vocabulary may not reflect actual CI seekers X  queries? Despite the artificiality inherent in usability studies (e.g. Toms &amp; Kinnucan, 1996 ), perhaps additional usability studies are needed to determine more ideal approaches to search-ing CI Web sites. 8. Limitations of the study
Thelwall et al. (2005) summarize many of the challenges to using Web log analysis as a research method. Many of these challenges occurred in this study. One of the most significant limitations in the case of MCI X  X  query log data is trying to iden-tify accurately individual users from the search session identifiers. For session identification, Web site designers have imple-mented the use of cookies because the proliferation of dynamic IP addresses has meant that it is impossible to identify individual users of a Web site ( Rubin, 2001 ). However, users may disable cookies on their computer, thus leaving this iden-tifying field in Web logs blank and consequently affect individual query submission analysis ( Silverstein et al., 1999; Thel-wall et al., 2005 ). MCI does not use cookies. This means that individual users and the respective computers they use cannot be identified as unique users since only IP addresses are logged. While the session identification for the incoming queries through the MCI and other Web sites is not perfect in identifying individual users, it does provide the ability to distinguish a unique search session initiated through a particular computer. The Web searcher X  X  querying behaviour, from the text sub-mitted to the number of page requests, for the search session started by the computer X  X  incoming IP address is recorded faithfully in the logs until the session is ended by either the Web browser being closed or the search session being inactive for 20 min which causes the session to time out.
 The other mentionable limitation of this study is that it does not include the examination of navigational Web logs for the
Web sites that are under scrutiny. No assumption is made that every user of the Web sites under examination uses only key-word querying to find the information that he or she is seeking. Users may find the information that they are seeking by clicking on relevant hyperlinks within a Web site until they reach their final information destination. However, this study attempts to attach meaning to the keywords users submit through the MCI and municipal government Web sites in their pursuit of community information. This is what makes this study unique in the area of Web searching that focuses on the local community. It takes large sets of data (keyword queries from Web query logs) and attaches meaning to these data to provide a thorough analysis of CI needs based on what the CI seeker actually types and submits through a Web site. The limitations of query analysis should not inordinately hamper the main purpose of the study: discovering what CI Web resources and are being used most by CI seekers in Southwestern Ontario by using relative comparisons, and, most importantly, what the users X  information needs are, based on the type of topical or conceptual CI being sought from these resources. 9. Conclusion
The online local information inquiries of a particular population or populations, and how these inquiries are being ad-dressed, are anything but simple and predictable. Even multiple sources of online information, such as those presented in this paper, that are designed to serve the same population demonstrates often that a population X  X  Web searching will vary often depending on how the information seeker perceives the scope of information and the potential utility of the informa-tion that those sources provide. This study is a first step in exploring the complexities of CI seeking in an online environment geographic regions. Despite this paper X  X  focus on a limited geographic region, the findings have shown that: local informa-tion seekers during the course of their Web searching may often choose the wrong resource to address their information need; health information seeking from the local community is not generally an important task despite the fact that people are generally likely to get medical attention in the immediate geographic vicinity depending on their situation; what may appear to be well designed home pages to Web sites may not indeed be so; and, that while the types of community infor-mation sought through MCI and its partner municipal government Web site are more diverse and specific than those re-vealed by two other studies, this study X  X  categories, like those reported by Durrance and Pettigrew (2002) , are markedly different than those found in CI taxonomies. This last point especially will hopefully stimulate debate as to whether these taxonomies should continue to rely on literary warrant for their empirical basis or whether it might be beneficial to consider user warrant to go beyond a taxonomic structure and create full-fledged thesauri for indexing and retrieval purposes for those CI organizations that wish to continue using a directory style model. 9.1. Future research directions
Unlike a lot of past published research that focused on Web searching conducted on individual Web sites, further studies are under way that will examine the same Web sites presented in this paper. However, these future studies will take a lon-gitudinal approach by analyzing 3 years X  worth of query data. Will the conceptual categories that emerged from the data in this study apply still or not? How, if at all, do CI seekers X  Web searches change over this time period? Will the 3 years of query data provide an accurate depiction of societal, political, and economic changes over this time period? Between this study and the proposed studies, better models of information needs as expressed through Web searching through single
Web sites will emerge hopefully to give a more complete portrait of how local CI Web sites are used to address citizen every-day information seeking behaviours.
