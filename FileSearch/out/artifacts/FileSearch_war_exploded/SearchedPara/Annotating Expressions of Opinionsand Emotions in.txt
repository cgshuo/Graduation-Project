 JANYCE WIEBE 1 , THERESA WILSON 2 and CLAIRE CARDIE 3 1. Introduction There has been a recent swell of interest in the automatic identification and extraction of opinions, emotions, and sentiments in text. Motivation for this task comes from the desire to provide tools for information analysts in government, commercial, and political domains, who want to automatically track attitudes and feelings in the news and on-line forums. How do people feel about recent events in the Middle East? Is the rhetoric from a particular opposition group intensifying? What is the range of opinions being expressed in the world press about the best course of action in Iraq? A system that could automatically identify opinions and emotions from text would be an enormous help to someone trying to answer these kinds of questions. language processing (NLP) have been working on the automatic identifica-tion of opinions and related tasks (e.g., Pang et al . (2002), Dave et al . (2003), Gordon et al . (2003), Riloff and Wiebe (2003), Riloff et al . (2003), Turney and Littman (2003), Yi et al . (2003), and Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003)). To date, most such work has focused on sentiment or subjectivity classi-fication at the document or sentence level. Document classification tasks include, for example, distinguishing editorials from news articles and classi-fying reviews as positive or negative (Wiebe et al ., 2001b; Pang et al ., 2002, Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003). A common sentence-level task is to classify sentences as subjective or objective (Riloff et al ., 2003; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).
 or sentences may not be sufficient. In the news, it is not uncommon to find two or more opinions in a single sentence, or to find a sentence containing opinions as well as factual information. Information extraction (IE) systems are natural language processing (NLP) systems that extract from text any information relevant to a pre-specified topic. An IE system trying to distinguish between factual information (which should be extracted) and non-factual information (which should be discarded or labeled uncertain) would benefit from the ability to pinpoint the particular clauses that contain opinions. This ability would also be important for multi-perspective question answering systems, which aim to present multiple answers to non-factual questions based on opinions derived from different sources; and for multi-document summari-zation systems, which need to summarize different opinions and perspectives. whether a document or text snippet is opinionated but also the intensity of the opinion. Flame detection systems, for example, want to identify strong rants and emotional tirades, while letting milder opinions pass through (Spertus, 1997; Kaufer, 2000). In addition, information analysts need to recognize changes over time in the degree of virulence expressed by persons or groups of interest, and to detect when their rhetoric is heating up or cooling down (Tong, 2001). Furthermore, knowing the types of attitude being expressed (e.g., positive versus negative evaluations) would enable a NLP application to target particular types of opinions.
 with rich information about opinions and emotions would support the development and evaluation of NLP systems that exploit such information. In particular, statistical and machine learning approaches have become the method of choice for constructing a wide variety of practical NLP applica-tions. These methods, however, typically require training and test corpora that have been manually annotated with respect to each language-processing task to be acquired.
 opinion and emotion in language through a corpus annotation study. In particular, we propose a detailed annotation scheme that identifies key components and properties of opinions, emotions, sentiments, speculations, evaluations, and other private states (Quirk et al ., 1985), i.e., internal states that cannot be directly observed by others.
 annotation scheme covers a broad and useful subset of the range of linguistic expressions and phenomena employed in naturally occurring text to express opinion and emotion.
 at the word-and phrase-level rather than at the level of the document or sentence. For every expression of a private state in each sentence, a private state frame is defined. A private state frame includes the source of the private state (i.e., whose private state is being expressed), the target (i.e., what the private state is about), and various properties involving intensity, signifi-cance, and type of attitude. An important property of sources in the anno-tation scheme is that they are nested , reflecting the fact that private states and speech events are often embedded in one another. The representation scheme also includes frames representing material that is attributed to a source, but is presented objectively, without evaluation, speculation, or other type of pri-vate state by that source.
 10,000-sentence corpus of articles from the world press. 1 We describe the annotation procedure in this paper, and present the results of an inter-annotator agreement study.
 rather than judging words and phrases themselves, out of context. That is, the annotators are not presented with word-or phrase-lists to judge (as in, e.g., Osgood et al . (1957), Heise (1965, 2001), and Subasic and Huettner (2001)). Furthermore, the annotation instructions do not specify how specific words should be annotated, and the annotators were not limited to marking any particular words, parts of speech, or grammatical categories. Consequently, a tremendous range of words and constituents were marked by the annotators, not only adjectives, modals, and adverbs, but also verbs, nouns, and various types of constituents. The contextual nature of the annotations makes the annotated data valuable for studying ambiguities that arise with subjective language. Such ambiguities range from word-sense ambiguity (e.g., objective senses of interest as in interest rate versus subjective senses as in take an interest in ), to ambiguity in idiomatic versus non-idiomatic usages (e.g., bombed in The comedian really bombed last night versus The troops bombed the building ), to various pragmatic ambiguities involving irony, sarcasm, and metaphor. opinion extraction experiments classifying sentences as subjective or objective (Riloff et al ., 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) and in experiments classifying the intensities of private states in individual clauses (Wilson et al ., 2004). How-ever, these experiments abstracted away from the details in the annotation scheme, so there is much room for additional experimentation in the auto-matic extraction of private states, and in exploiting the information in NLP applications.
 overview of the annotation scheme, ending with a short example. Section 3 elaborates on the various aspects of the annotation scheme, providing motivations, examples, and further clarifications; this section ends with an extended example, which illustrates the various components of the annota-tion scheme and the interactions among them. Section 4 presents observa-tions about the annotated data. Section 5 describes the corpus and Section 6 presents the results of an inter-annotator agreement study. Section 7 dis-cusses related work, Section 8 discusses future work, and Section 9 presents conclusions. 2. Overview of the Annotation Scheme 2.1. Means of Expressing Private States The goal of the annotation scheme is to represent internal mental and emotional states and to distinguish subjective information from material presented as fact. As a result, the annotation scheme is centered on the notion of private state , a general term that covers opinions, beliefs, thoughts, feel-ings, emotions, goals, evaluations, and judgments. As Quirk et al . (1985) define it, a private state is a state that is not open to objective observation or verification:  X  X  X  person may be observed to assert that God exists , but not to believe that God exists . Belief is in this sense  X  private X . X  X  (p. 1181)  X  as states of experiencers holding attitudes , optionally toward targets . For example, for the private state expressed in the sentence John hates Mary , the experiencer is John , the attitude is hate , and the target is Mary . expressions in text:  X  explicit mentions of private states  X  speech events expressing private states  X  expressive subjective elements An example of an explicit mention of a private state is  X  X  X ears X  X  in (1): (1)  X  X  X he U.S. fears a spill-over, X  X  said Xirao-Nima.
 (2)  X  X  X he report is full of absurdities , X  X  Xirao-Nima said .
 writing event. A speech event has a writer or speaker as well as a target, which is whatever is written or said.
 element (Banfield, 1982). There are a number of additional examples of expressive subjective elements in sentences (3) and (4): (3) The time has come, gentlemen , for Sharon, the assassin , to realize that (4)  X  X  X e foresaw electoral fraud but not daylight robbery , X  X  Tsvangirai said. the style of language that is used. In (3), although the writer does not explicitly say that he hates Sharon, his choice of words clearly demonstrates a negative attitude toward him. In sentence (4), describing the election as  X  X  X aylight robbery X  X  clearly reflects the anger being experienced by the speaker, Tsvangirai. As used in these sentences, the phrases  X  X  X he time has come, X  X   X  X  X entlemen, X  X   X  X  X he assassin, X  X   X  X  X njustice cannot last long, X  X   X  X  X raud, X  X  and  X  X  X aylight robbery X  X  are all expressive subjective elements. Expressive subjective elements are used by people to express their frustration, anger, wonder, posi-tive sentiment, mirth, etc., without explicitly stating that they are frustrated, angry, etc. Sarcasm and irony often involve expressive subjective elements. element. In fact, two private state frames are created for sentence (2): one for the speech event and one for the expressive subjective element. The first represents the more general fact that private states are expressed in what was said; the second pinpoints a specific expression used to express Tsvangairai X  X  negative evaluation.
 and expressive subjective elements are explicitly mapped onto components of the annotation scheme. 2.2. Private State Frames We propose two types of private state frames: expressive subjective element frames will be used to represent expressive subjective elements; and direct subjective frames will be used to represent both subjective speech events (i.e., speech events expressing private states) and explicitly mentioned private states. Direct subjective expressions are typically more explicit than expres-sive subjective element expressions, which is reflected in the fact that direct subjective frames contain more attributes than expressive subjective element frames. Specifically, the frames have the following attributes: Direct subjective (subjective speech event or explicit private state) frame:  X  text anchor: a pointer to the span of text that represents the speech event or explicit mention of a private state. (Text anchors are described more fully in Section 3.1.)  X  source: the person or entity that is expressing the private state, possibly the writer. (See Sections 2.5 and 3.2 for more information on sources.)  X  target: the target or topic of the private state, i.e., what the speech event or private state is about. To date, our corpus includes only targets that are agents (see Section 2.4) and that are targets of negative or positive private states (see Section 4.4).  X  properties:  X  intensity: the intensity of the private state ( low , medium , high ,or  X  expression intensity: the contribution of the speech event or private state  X  insubstantial: true, if the private state is not substantial in the discourse.  X  attitude type: This attribute currently represents the polarity of the Expressive subjective element frame:  X  text anchor: a pointer to the span of text that denotes the subjective or expressive phrase.  X  source: the person or entity that is expressing the private state, possibly the writer.  X  properties:  X  intensity: the intensity of the private state ( low , medium , high ,or extreme )  X  attitude type: This attribute represents the polarity of the private state. 2.3. Objective Speech Event Frames To distinguish opinion-oriented material from material presented as factual, we also define objective speech event frames . These are used to represent material that is attributed to some source, but is presented as objective fact. They include a subset of the slots in private state frames, namely the text anchor , source , and target slots.
 Objective speech event frame :  X  text anchor : a pointer to the span of text that denotes the speech event  X  source : the speaker or writer  X  target : the target or topic of the speech event, i.e., the content of what is said. To date, targets of objective speech event frames are not yet annotated in our corpus.
 For example, an objective speech event frame is created for  X  X  X aid X  X  in the following sentence (assuming no undue influence from the context): (5) Sargeant O X  X eary said the incident took place at 2:00pm.
 Sargeant O X  X eary as the source of information. 2.4. Agent Frames The annotation scheme includes an agent frame for noun phrases that refer to sources of private states and speech events, i.e., for all noun phrases that act as the experiencer of a private state, or the speaker/writer of a speech event. Each agent frame generally has two slots. The text anchor slot includes a pointer to the span of text that denotes the noun phrase source. The source slot contains a unique alpha-numeric ID that is used to denote this source throughout the document. The agent frame associated with the first infor-mative (e.g., non-pronominal) reference to this source in the document includes an id slot to set up the document-specific source-id mapping, document that quotes him. Consider the following consecutive sentences from that document: (6)  X  X  X  have been to Tibet many times. I have seen the truth there, which is (7) Some Westerners who have been there have also seen the in these sentences: Agent: Agent: The connection between agent frames and the source slots of the private state and objective speech event frames will be explained in the following sub-section. 2.5. Nested Sources The source of a speech event is the speaker or writer. The source of a private state is the experiencer of the private state, i.e., the person whose opinion or emotion is being expressed. Obviously, the writer of an article is a source, because he or she wrote the sentences composing the article, but the writer may also write about other people X  X  private states and speech events, leading to multiple sources in a single sentence. For example, each of the following sentences has two sources: the writer (because he or she wrote the sentences), and Sue (because she is the source of a speech event in (8) and of private states in (9) and (10)). (8) Sue said,  X  X  X he election was fair. X  X  (9) Sue thinks that the election was fair. (10) Sue is afraid to go outside.
 All we know is what the writer tells us. Sentence (8), for example, does not directly present Sue X  X  speech event but rather Sue X  X  speech event according to the writer. Thus, we have a natural nesting of sources in a sentence. source, and private states are often directed toward the private states of others. Consider the following sentences (the first is sentence (1), reprinted here): (1)  X  X  X he U.S. fears a spill-over, X  X  said Xirao-Nima. (11) China criticized the U.S. report X  X  criticism of China X  X  human rights to the writer, according to Xirao-Nima, the U.S. fears a spill-over. The source of the private state expressed by  X  X  X ears X  X  is thus the nested source target of China X  X  criticism. Thus, the nested source for  X  X  X riticism X  X  is  X  writer , China , U . S . report  X  .
 writer, since he or she wrote the sentence. In addition, nested source anno-tations are composed of the IDs associated with each source, as described in the previous subsection. Thus, for example, the nested source  X  writer , China , U . S . report  X  would be represented using the IDs associated with the writer, China, and the report being referred to, respectively. 2.6. Examples We end this section with examples of direct subjective, expressive subjective element, and objective speech event frames. Throughout this paper, targets are indicated only in cases where the targets are agents and are the targets of positive or negative private states, as those are the targets labeled in our annotated corpus.
 assuming that the relevant source ID X  X  have already been defined: (12)  X  X  X he US fears a spill-over, X  X  said Xirao-Nima, a professor of foreign Objective speech event: Objective speech event: Direct subjective: The first objective speech event frame represents that, according to the writer, it is true that Xirao-Nima uttered the quote and is a professor at the uni-versity referred to. The implicit attribute is included because the writer X  X  speech event is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence (i.e., there is no explicit phrase such as  X  X  X  write X  X ).
 writer, according to Xirao-Nima, it is true that the US fears a spillover. Finally, when we drill down to the subordinate clause we find a private state: the US fear of a spillover. Such detailed analyses, encoded as annotations on the input text, would enable a person or an automated system to pinpoint the subjectivity in a sentence, and attribute it appropriately.
 (13)  X  X  X he report is full of absurdities, X  X  Xirao-Nima said. [ X  X  X S Human Objective speech event: Direct subjective: Expressive subjective element: The objective frame represents that, according to the writer, it is true that Xirao-Nima uttered the quoted string. The second frame is created for  X  X  X aid X  X  because it is a subjective speech event: private states are conveyed in what is uttered. Note that intensity is high but expression intensity is neutral : the private state being expressed is strong, but the specific speech event phrase  X  X  X aid X  X  does not itself contribute to the intensity of the private state. The third frame is for the expressive subjective element  X  X  X ull of absurdities. X  X  3. Elaborations and Illustrations 3.1. Text Anchors in Direct Subjective and Objective Speech Event All frames in the private state annotation scheme are directly encoded as XML annotations on the underlying text. In particular, each XML anno-tation frame is anchored to a particular location in the underlying text via its associated text anchor slot. This section elaborates on the appropriate text anchors to include in direct subjective and objective speech event frames and further explains the notion of an  X  X  X mplicit X  X  speech event.
 For the discussion in this subsection, it will be useful to distinguish between the following: span that designates the attitude (or attitudes) being expressed. For speech event phrases, this is the text span that refers to the speaking or writing event. inside the scope of the private state or speech event phrase. This is the text span that designates the target.
 (14)  X  X  X t is heresy, X  X  said Cao,  X  X  X he  X  Shouters X  claim they are bigger than sentence itself). The source and speech event phrase are implicit; that is, we understand the sentence as implicitly in the scope of  X  X  X  write that ... X  X  or  X  X  X ccording to me ... X  X . Thus, the entire sentence is subordinated to the (implicit) speech event phrase.
  X  Source:  X  writer , Cao  X   X  private state or speech event phrase:  X  X  X aid X  X   X  Subordinated constituents:  X  X  X t is heresy X  X ;  X  X  X he  X  Shouters X  claim they are bigger than Jesus. X  X  Finally, we have the Shouters X  claim:  X  Source:  X  writer , Cao , Shouters  X   X  private state or speech event phrase:  X  X  X laim X  X   X  Subordinated constituents:  X  X  X hey are bigger than Jesus X  X  For sentences that explicitly present a private state or speech event, the text anchor slot is filled with the private state or speech event phrase. Moreover, in the underlying text-based representation, the XML annotation for the private state is anchored on the private state or speech event phrase.
 speech event phrase is implicit, as was the case for the writer X  X  top-level speech event in sentence (14). Since the phrase is implicit, it cannot serve as the anchor in the underlying representation. A similar situation arises when direct quotes are not accompanied by discourse parentheticals (such as  X  X , she said X  X ). An example is the second sentence in the following passage: (15)  X  X  X e think this is an example of the United States using human rights text anchor for the frame (and to anchor the annotation on the sentence or quoted string, in the text-based XML representation). 2 annotation scheme. 3.2. Nested Sources Although the nested source examples in Section 2 were fairly simple in nat-ure, the nesting of sources may be quite deep and complex in practice. For example, consider sentence (16): (16) The Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it was  X  X  X urprised, to put it and the U.S. State Department. The writer is the source of the overall sentence. The remaining explicitly mentioned private states and speech events in (16) have the following nested sources: Speech event  X  X  X aid X  X :  X  Source:  X  writer , Foreign Ministry  X  The relevant part of the sentence for identifying the source is  X  X  The foreign ministry said ... X  X  Private state  X  X  X urprised, to put it mildly X  X :  X  Source:  X  writer , Foreign Ministry , Foreign Ministry  X  The relevant part of the sentence for identifying the source is  X  X  The foreign ministry said it was surprised, to put it mildly ... X  X  The Foreign Ministry appears twice because its  X  X  X urprised X  X  private state is nested in its  X  X  X aid X  X  speech event. Note that the entire string  X  X  X urprised, to put it mildly X  X  is the private state phrase, rather than only  X  X  X urprised, X  X  because  X  X  X o put it mildly X  X  intensifies the private state. The Foreign Ministry is not only surprised, it is very surprised. As shown below,  X  X  X o put it mildly X  X  is also an expressive subjective element. Private state  X  X  X riticism X  X :  X  Source:  X  writer , Foreign Ministry , Foreign Ministry , U . S . State Depart-ment  X  The relevant part of the sentence for identifying the source is  X  X  The foreign ministry said it was surprised, to put it mildly by the U.S. State Department  X  X  criticism ... X  X  Private state/speech event  X  X  X bjected X  X : only writer and Foreign Ministry , note that the sentence is a compound sentence, and that  X  X  X bjected X  X  is not in the s cope of  X  X  X aid X  X  or  X  X  X urprised. X  X  Expressive subjective elements also have nested sources. The expressive subjective elements in (16) have the following sources: Expressive subjective element  X  X  X o put it mildly X  X :  X  Source:  X  writer , Foreign Ministry  X  The Foreign Ministry uses a subjective intensifier,  X  X  X o put it mildly, X  X  to express sarcasm while describing its surprise. This subjectivity is at the level of the Foreign Ministry X  X  speech, so the source is  X  writer , Foreign Ministry  X  rather than  X  writer , Foreign Ministry , Foreign Ministry  X  .
 Expressive subjective element  X  X  X dious X  X :  X  Source:  X  writer , Foreign Ministry  X  The word  X  X  X dious X  X  is not within the scope of the  X  X  X urprise X  X  private state, but rather attaches to the  X  X  X bjected X  X  private state/speech event. Thus, as for  X  X  X o put it mildly, X  X  the source is nested two levels, not three.
 As we can see in the frames above, the expressive subjective elements in (16) have the same nested sources as their immediately dominating private state or speech terms (i.e.,  X  X  X o put it mildly X  X  and  X  X  X aid X  X  have the same nested source; and  X  X  X dious X  X  and  X  X  X bjected X  X  have the same nested source). However, expressive subjective elements might attach to higher-level speech events or private states. 3 For example, consider  X  X  X igger than Jesus X  X  in the following sentence from a Chinese news article: (14)  X  X  X t is heresy, X  X  said Cao,  X  X  X he  X  Shouters X  claim they are bigger than particular, the Shouters aren X  X  really making this claim in the text; instead, it seems clear from the sentence that it X  X  Cao X  X  interpretation of the situation that comprises the  X  X  X laim. X  X  3.3. Speech Events This section focuses on the distinction between objective speech events, and subjective speech events (which, recall, are represented by direct subjective frames). To help the reader understand the distinction being made, we first give examples of subjective versus objective speech events, including explicit speech events as well as implicit speech events attributed to the writer. Next, the distinction is more formally specified. Finally, we discuss an interesting context-dependent aspect of the subjective versus objective distinction. and objective speech events when the speech event term is explicit. Note that, in both sentences, the speech event term is  X  X  X aid, X  X  which itself is neutral. (4)  X  X  X e foresaw electoral fraud but not daylight robbery, X  X  Tsvangirai (17) Medical Department head Dr Hamid Saeed said the patient X  X  blood had objective speech event frame (that someone said something is presented as objectively true). Of interest to us here are the explicit speech events referred to with  X  X  X aid. X  X  The one in sentence (4) is opinionated. Its representation is a direct subjective frame with an expression intensity rating of neutral , but an intensity rating of high , reflecting the strong negative evaluation expressed by Tsvangirai . In contrast, the information in (17) is simply presented as fact, and the speech event referred to by  X  X  X aid X  X  is represented with an objective speech event frame (which contains no intensity ratings).
 subjective and objective speech events attributed to the writer: (18) The report is flawed and inaccurate. (19) Bell Industries Inc. increased its quarterly to 10 cents from 7 cents a and (19). The frame for (18) is a direct subjective frame, reflecting the writer X  X  negative evaluations of the report. In contrast, the frame for (19) is an objective speech event frame, because the sentence describes an event pre-sented by the writer as true (assuming nothing in context suggests otherwise). an explicit speech event term, as in (18) and (19), whether the speech event is subjective or objective depends entirely on the context and the presence or absence of expressive subjective elements.
 objective speech events. Suppose that the annotator has identified a speech X 1 according to X 2 , does S express X 3  X  X  private state? If yes, the speech event is subjective (and a direct subjective frame is used). Otherwise, it is objective (and an objective speech event frame is used). Note that the frames for a given sentence may be mixtures of subjective and objective speech events. For example, the frames for sentence (2) given in Section 2.6 above include an objective speech event frame for the writer X  X  top-level speech event (the writer presents it as true that Xirao-Nima uttered the quoted string), as well as a direct subjective frame for Xirao-Nima X  X  speech event (Xirao-Nima expresses negative evaluation  X  that the report is full of absurdities  X  in his utterance). Note also that, even if a speech event is subjective, it may still express something the immediate source believes is true. Consider the sentence  X  X  X ohn criticized Mary for smoking. X  X  According to the writer, John expresses a pri-vate state (his negative evaluation of Mary X  X  smoking). However, this does not mean that, according to the writer, John does not believe that Mary smokes. subjective speech events, namely those expressing facts and claims that are disputed in the context of the article. Consider the statement  X  X  X moking causes cancer. X  X  In some articles, this speech event would be objective, while in others, it would be subjective. The annotation frames selected to represent smoking causes cancer should reflect the status of the proposition in the article. In a modern scientific article, the proposition that smoking causes cancer is likely to be treated as an undisputed fact. However, in an older article giving views of scientists and tobacco executives, for example, it may be a fact under dispute. When the proposition is disputed, the speech event is represented as subjective. Even if only the views of the scientists or only those of the tobacco executives are explicitly given in the article, a subjective rep-resentation might still be the appropriate one. It would be the appropriate representation if, for example, the scientists are arguing against the idea that smoking does not cause cancer. The scientists would be going beyond simply presenting something they believe is a fact; they would be arguing against an alternative view, and for the truthfulness of their own view. 3.4. Intensity Ratings Intensity ratings are included in the annotation scheme to indicate the intensities of the private states expressed in subjective sentences. This is an informative feature in itself; for example, intensity would be informative for distinguishing inflammatory messages from reasoned arguments, and for recognizing when rhetoric is ratcheting up or cooling down in a particular forum. In addition, intensity ratings help in distinguishing borderline cases from clear cases of subjectivity and objectivity: the difference between no subjectivity and a low-intensity private state might be highly debatable, but the difference between no subjectivity and a medium or high-intensity private state is often much clearer. The annotation study presented below in Section 6 provides evidence that annotator agreement is quite high concerning which are the clear cases of subjective and objective sentences.

 the expression intensity , which deserves additional explanation. The expression intensity attribute represents the contribution to intensity made specifically by the private state or speech event phrase. For example, the expression intensity of said , added , told , announce , and report is typically neutral, the expression intensity of criticize is typically medium, and the expression intensity of vehemently denied is typically high or extreme.
 3.5. Mixtures of Private States and Speech Events This section notes something the reader may have noticed earlier: many speech event terms imply mixtures of private states and speech. Examples are berate , object , praise , and criticize . This had two effects on the development of our annotation scheme. First, it motivated the decision to use a single frame type, direct subjective, for both subjective speech events and explicit private states. With a single frame type, there is no need to classify an expression as either a speech event or a private state.
 attribute described in the previous subsection. Purely speech terms are typ-ically assigned expression intensity of neutral, while mixtures of private states and speech events, such as criticize and praise , are typically assigned a rating between low and extreme. 3.6. Insubstantial Private States and Speech Events Recall that direct subjective frames can include the insubstantial attribute. This section provides additional discussion regarding the use of this attribute and gives examples illustrating situations in which it is included. applications might need to identify all private state and speech event expressions in a document (for example, systems performing lexical acqui-sition to populate a dictionary of subjective language), while others might want to find only those opinions and other private states that are substantial in the discourse (for example, summarization and question answering sys-tems). The insubstantial attribute allows applications to choose which they want: all private states, or just those whose frames have the value false for the insubstantial attribute.

For speech events and private states that are not real, the presupposition that the event occurred or the state exists is removed via the context (or, the event or state is explicitly asserted not to exist).

Consider the following sentence from a novel about an imaginary world: (23)  X  X  X t X  X  wonderful! X  X  said Dorothy. [ Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz , 1908,  X  X  X t X  X  wonderful X  X  in that world, which expresses her private state. Thus, the insubstantial attribute in the frame for  X  X  X aid X  X  in (23) would be false.  X  X  X ot significant.

Consider the following sentence: (24) Such wishful thinking risks making the US an accomplice in the (not significant) There are two private state frames created for  X  X  X uch wishful thinking X  X  in (24): Expressive subjective element: Direct subjective: The first frame represents the writer X  X  negative subjectivity in describing the US X  X  view as  X  X  X uch wishful thinking X  X  (note that the source is simply  X  writer  X  ). The second frame is the one of interest in this subsection: it represents the US X  X   X  X  X hinking X  X  private state (attributed to it by the writer, hence the nested source  X  writer , US  X  ). The insubstantial attribute for the frame is true because the sentence does not present the contents of the private state; it does not identify the US view which the writer thinks is merely  X  X  X ishful thinking. X  X  The presence of this attribute serves as a signal to NLP systems that this sentence is not informative with respect to the contents of the US X  X   X  X  X hinking X  X  private state. 3.7. Private State Actions Thus far, we have seen private states expressed in text via a speech event or by expressions denoting subjectivity, emotion, etc. Occasionally, however, private states are expressed by direct physical actions. Such actions are called private state actions (Wiebe, 1994). Examples include booing someone, sighing heavily, shaking ones fist angrily, waving ones hand dismissively, smirking, and frowning.  X  X  X pplaud X  X  in sentence (25) is an example of a positive-evaluative private state action. (25) As the long line of would-be voters marched in, those near the front of distinct type of frame into the annotation scheme for them. Instead, they are represented using direct subjective frames. 3.8. Extended Example This section gives the speech event and private state frames for a passage from an article from the Beijing China Daily ( X  X  X S Human Rights Report Defies Truth, X  X  2002-02-11, By Xiao Xin, Beijing China Daily, Beijing, China) : (Q1) As usual, the US State Department published its annual report on (Q2) And as usual, the portion about China contains little truth and many (Q3) Its aim of the 2001 report is to tarnish China X  X  image and exert political (Q4)  X  X  X he United States was slandering China again, X  X  said Xirao-Nima, a Sentence (Q1) is an objective sentence without speech events or private states (other than the writer X  X  top-level speech event). Though a report is referred to, the sentence is about publishing the report, rather than what the report says.
 Objective speech event: Sentence (Q2) (reprinted here for convenience) expresses the writer X  X  sub-jectivity: (Q2) And as usual, the portion about China contains little truth and many Thus, the top-level speech event is represented with a direct subjective frame: Direct subjective: The frames for the individual subjective elements in (Q2) are the following: Expressive subjective element: Expressive subjective element: Expressive subjective element: The annotator who labeled this sentence identified three distinct subjective elements in the sentence. The first one,  X  X  X nd as usual, X  X  is interesting because its subjectivity is highly contextual. The subjectivity is amplified by the fact that  X  X  X s usual X  X  is repeated from the sentence before. The third expressive subjective element,  X  X  X any absurdities, exaggerations and fabrications, X  X  could have been divided into multiple frames; annotators vary in the extent to which they identify long subjective elements or divide them into sequences of shorter ones (this is discussed below in Section 6).
 events at different levels: (Q3) Its aim of the 2001 report is to tarnish China X  X  image and exert political The entire sentence is attributed to the writer. The quoted content is attrib-uted by the writer to the human rights experts, so the source for that speech event is  X  writer , human rights experts  X  . In addition, another level of nesting is introduced, with source  X  writer , human rights experts , report  X  , because a private state of the report is presented, namely that the report has the aim to tarnish China X  X  image and exert political pressure (according to the writer, according to the human rights experts). The specific frames created for the sentence are as follows.
 frame: the writer presents it as true, without emotion or other type of private state, that human rights experts said something at a particular location on a particular day.
 Objective speech event: Next we have the frame representing the human rights experts X  speech: Direct subjective: Note that a direct subjective rather than an objective speech event frame is used. The reason is that, in the context of the article, saying that the aim of the report is to tarnish China X  X  image is argumentative. This is an example of a speech event being classified as subjective because the claim is controversial or disputed in the context of the article. In this article, people are arguing with what the report says and questioning its motives. The expression intensity is neutral, because the text anchor is simply  X  X  X aid X  X . The intensity , however, is medium, reflecting the negative evaluation being expressed by the experts (according to the writer).
 element  X  X  X arnish X  X ; The choice of the word  X  X  X arnish X  X  reflects negative eval-uation of the experts toward the motivations of the authors of the report (as presented by the writer): Expressive subjective element: Finally, a direct subjective frame is introduced for the nested private state referred to by  X  X  X im X  X : Direct subjective: According to the writer, according to the experts, the authors of the report have a negative intention toward China, namely to slander them.
 (Q4)  X  X  X he United States was slandering China again, X  X  said Xirao-Nima, a The writer X  X  speech event is objective (the writer objectively states that some-one said something and provides information about the career of the speaker): Objective speech event: The frame representing Xirao-Nima X  X  speech is subjective, reflecting his negative evaluation: Direct subjective: The subjectivity expressed by  X  X  X landering X  X  in this sentence is multifaceted. When we consider the level of  X  writer , Xirao ) Nima  X  , the word  X  X  X landers X  X  is a negative evaluation of the truthfulness of what the United States said. When we consider the level of  X  writer , Xirao ) Nima , United States  X  , the word  X  X  X landers X  X  communicates that, according to the writer, according to Xirao-Nima, the United States said something negative about China. Thus, two frames are created for the same text span: Expressive subjective element: Direct subjective: 4. Observations One might initially think that writers and speakers employ a relatively small set of linguistic expressions to describe private states. Our annotated corpus, however, indicates otherwise, and the goal of this section is to give the reader some sense of the complexity of the data. In particular, we provide here a sampling of corpus-based observations that attest to the variety and ambi-guity of linguistic phenomena present in naturally occurring text. corpus (see Section 5), which was manually annotated according to our private state annotation scheme presented in this paper. More specifically, the observations are drawn from the subset of data that was used as training data in previously published papers (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Riloff et al ., 2003), which consists of 66 documents, for a total of 1341 sentences. 4.1. Wide Variety of Words and Parts of Speech A striking feature of the data is the large variety of words that appear in subjective expressions. First consider direct subjective expressions whose expression intensity is not neutral and that are not implicit . There are 1046 such expressions (constituting 2117 word tokens) in the data. Considering only content words, i.e., nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, 4 and excluding a small list of stop words ( be , have, not , and no ), there are 1438 word tokens. Among those, there are 638 distinct words (44%).
 words. There are 1766 expressive subjective elements in the data, which contain 4684 word tokens. Considering only nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, and excluding the stop words listed above, there are 2844 word tokens. Among those, there are 1463 distinct words (51%). Clearly, a small list of words would not suffice to cover the terms appearing in subjective expressions.
 and hope . But there is more diversity in part-of-speech than one might think. Consider the same words as above (i.e., nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, excluding the stop words be , have , not , and no ), in the 1046 direct subjective expressions referred to above. While 54% of them are verbs, 6% are adverbs, 8% are adjectives, and 32% are nouns. Interestingly, 342 of the 1046 direct subjective expressions (33%) do not contain a verb other than be or have . much of the work on identifying subjective expressions in NLP has focused on learning adjectives (e.g., Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997), Wiebe (2000), and Turney (2002)). Among the content words (as defined above) in expressive subjective elements, 14% are adverbs, 21% are verbs, 27% are adjectives, and 38% are nouns. Fully 1087 of the 1766 expressive subjective elements in the data (62%) do not contain adjectives. 4.2. Ambiguity of Individual Words We saw in the previous section that a small list of words will not suffice to cover subjective expressions. This section shows further that many words are ambiguous w.r.t. subjectivity in that they appear in both subjective and objective expressions.
 elements whose expression intensity is not low , and direct subjective expressions whose expression intensity is not neutral or low and that are not implicit . The remainder constitute objective expressions. Note that expres-sions with intensity low are included in the objective class. As discussed below in Section 6, the results of our inter-annotator agreement study suggest that expressions of intensity medium or higher tend to be clear cases of subjective expressions; the borderline cases are most often low .
 jective expressions, how many appear exclusively in objective expressions, and how many appear in both. This gives us an idea of the degree of lexical (i.e., word-level) ambiguity with respect to subjectivity.
 reason to analyze those appearing just once, since there is no potential for them to appear in both subjective and objective expressions). For each of these word types, we measure the percentage of its occurrences that appear in subjective expressions. Table I summarizes these results, showing the num-bers of word types whose instances appear in subjective expressions to varying degrees. The first row, for example, represents word types for which between 0 and 10% of its instances appear in subjective expressions. There are 1423 such word types, 58.5% of the 2434 being considered.
 above the lowest decile and below the highest one, showing that many words appear in both subjective and objective expressions. The following are some examples of these words and their counts in subjective and objective expressions: achieved (two subjective, four objective); against (15 subjective, 40 objective); considering (three subjective, seven objective); difficult (seven subjective, eight objective); fact (14 subjective, seven objective); necessary (two subjective, two objective); pressure (four subjective, four objective); thousands (two subjective, five objective); victory (three subjective, nine objective); and world (13 subjective, 51 objective).
 adverbs excluding the stop words ( be , have , not , and no ). Again, we only consider words appearing at least twice in the data. The degree of ambiguity is greater with this set: 38% of the word types fall between the extreme deciles. presence of subjectivity cue words themselves, disregarding context (e.g., Hart (1984), Anderson and McMaster (1982), Hatzivassiloglou and McKe-own (1997), Turney (2002), Gordon et al . (2003), Yi et al . (2003)), the observations in this section suggest that different usages of words, in context, need to be distinguished to understand subjectivity. 4.3. Many Sentences are Mixtures of Subjectivity and Objectivity As we have seen in previous sections, a primary focus of our annotation scheme is identifying specific expressions of private states, rather than simply labeling entire sentences or documents as subjective or objective. In this section, we present corpus-based evidence of the need for this type of fine-grained analysis of opinion and emotion (i.e., below the level of the sentence). Specifically, we show that most sentences in the data set are mixtures of objectivity and subjectivity, and often contain subjective expressions of varying intensities.
 but rather the private states evoked in the sentence. Thus, here we consider objective speech event frames and direct subjective frames. The expressive subjective element frames are not considered because expressive subjective elements are always subordinated by direct subjective frames, and the intensity ratings for direct subjective frames subsume the intensity ratings of individual expressive subjective elements. We consider the intensity rating rather than the expression intensity rating, because the former is a rating of the private state being expressed, while the latter is a rating of the specific speech event or private state phrase being used.
 contain no subjectivity at all or are mixtures of objectivity and direct sub-jective frames of intensity only low . Practically speaking, we may consider these to be the objective sentences.
 tures of two or more intensity ratings, or are mixtures of objective and subjective frames. Of these, 210 are mixtures of three or more intensity rat-ings, or are mixtures of objective frames and two or more intensity ratings. 4.4. Polarity and Intensity Recall that direct subjective frames include an attribute attitude type that represents the polarity of the private state. The possible values are positive , negative , both , and neither . 5 number of the direct subjective frames have the attitude type value neither . The annotators were told to indicate positive , negative ,or both only if they were comfortable with these values; otherwise, the value should be neither . Out of the 1689 direct subjective frames in the data, 69% were not assigned one of those polarity values. This large proportion of neither ratings repli-cates previous findings in a study involving different data and annotators (Wiebe et al ., 2001a). It suggests that simple polarity is not a sufficient notion of attitude type, 6 and motivates our new work on expanding this attribute to include additional distinctions (see Section 8).
 26% are positive , and 1% are both . Thus, we see that the majority of polarity values that the annotators felt comfortable marking are negative values. Interestingly, negative ratings are positively correlated with higher intensity ratings: stronger expressions of opinions and emotions tend to be more negative in this corpus. Specifically, 4.6% of the low-intensity direct sub-jective frames are negative, 20% of the medium-intensity direct subjective frames are negative, and 46% of the high-or extreme-intensity direct sub-jective frames are negative. Positive polarity is middle-of-the-road: 67% of the positive frames are medium intensity, while 15.8% are low-intensity and 17.3% are high or extreme intensity.
 91% of the low-intensity direct subjective frames have attitude type neither or both , while 69% of the medium-intensity and only 49% of the high-or extreme-intensity direct subjective frames have one of these values. These observations lead us to believe that the intensity of subjective expressions will be informative for recognizing polarity, and vice versa. 5. Data To date, 10,657 sentences in 535 documents have been annotated according to the annotation scheme presented in this paper. The documents are Eng-lish-language versions of news documents from the world press. The docu-ments are from 187 different news sources in a variety of countries. They date from June 2001 to May 2002.

The original documents and their annotations are available at http://nrrc.mitre.org/NRRC/publications.htm. nology that is in the current release of the corpus. The two versions are equivalent and the representations are homomorphic. Later releases of the corpus will be updated to include the new terminology. 6. Annotator Training and Inter-coder Agreement Results In this section, we describe the training process for annotators and the results of an inter-coder agreement study. 6.1. Conceptual Annotation Instructions Annotators begin their training by reading a coding manual that presents the annotation scheme and examples of its application (Wiebe, 2002). Below is the introduction to the manual:
Picture an information analyst searching for opinions in the world press about a particular event. Our research goal is to help him or her find what they are looking for by automatically finding text segments expressing opinions, and organizing them in a useful way.

In order to develop a computer system to do this, we need people to annotate (mark up) texts with relevant properties, such as whether the language used is opinionated and whether someone expresses a negative attitude toward someone else.

Below are descriptions of the properties we want you to annotate. We will not give you formal criteria for identifying them. We don X  X  know formal criteria for identifying them! We want you to use your human knowledge and intuition to identify the information. Our system will then look at your answers and try to figure out how it can make the same kinds of judgments itself.

This document presents the ideas behind the annotations. A separate document will explain exactly what to annotate and how. [ Details about accessing this document deleted .]
When you annotate, please try to be as consistent as you can be. In addition, it is essential that you interpret sentences and words with respect to the context in which they appear. Don X  X  take them out of context and think about what they could mean; judge them as they are being used in that particular sentence and document.
 Three themes from this introduction are echoed throughout the instructions: 1. There are no fixed rules about how particular words should be annotated. 2. Sentences should be interpreted with respect to the contexts in which they 3. The annotators should be as consistent as they can be with respect to their We believe that these general strategies for annotation support the creation of corpora that will be useful for studying expressions of subjectivity in context. 6.2. Training After reading the conceptual annotation instructions, annotator training proceeds in two stages. First, the annotator focuses on learning the anno-tation scheme. Then, the annotator learns how to create the annotations using the annotation tool (http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpga/opinionannotations /gate-instructions), which is implemented within GATE (Cunningham et al ., 2002).
 tation scheme to four to six training documents, using pencil and paper to mark the private state frames and objective speech frames and their attri-butes. The training documents are not trivial. Instead, they are news articles from the world press, drawn from the same corpus of documents that the annotator will be annotating. When the annotation scheme was first being developed, these documents were studied and discussed in detail, until con-sensus annotations were agreed upon that could be used as a gold standard. After annotating each training document, the annotator compares his or her annotations to the gold standard for the document. During this time, the annotator is encouraged to ask questions, to discuss where his or her tags disagree with the gold standard, and to reread any portion of the conceptual annotation scheme that may not yet be perfectly clear.
 and can consistently apply the scheme on paper, the annotator learns to apply the scheme using the annotation tool. First, the annotator reads spe-cific instructions and works through a tutorial on performing the annotations using GATE. The annotator then practices by annotating two or three new documents using the annotation tool.
 trained as described above. One annotator was an undergraduate accounting major, one was a graduate student in computer science with previous annotation experience, and one was an archivist with a degree in library science. None of the annotators is an author of this paper. For an annotator with no prior annotation experience or exposure to the concepts in the annotation scheme, the basic training takes approximately 40 h. At the time of the agreement study, each annotator had been annotating part-time (8 X  12 h per week) for 3 X 6 months. 6.3. Agreement Study To measure agreement on various aspects of the annotation scheme, the three annotators (A, M, and S) independently annotated 13 documents with a total of 210 sentences. The articles are from a variety of topics and were selected so that 1/3 of the sentences are from news articles reporting on objective topics, 1/3 of the sentences are from news articles reporting on opinionated topics ( X  X  X ot-topic X  X  articles), and 1/3 of the sentences are from editorials. 7 difficulty of each article on a scale from 1 to 3, with 1 being the easiest and 3 being the most difficult. The annotators were not told which articles were about objective topics or which articles were editorials, only that they were being given a variety of different articles to annotate.
 that the articles about objective topics would be the easiest. The ratings that the annotators assigned to the articles support this hypothesis. The annota-tors rated an average of 44% of the articles in the study as easy (rating 1) and 26% as difficult (rating 3). More importantly, they rated an average of 73% of the objective-topic articles as easy, and 89% of the editorials as difficult. annotate than articles about objective topics and that editorials would be more difficult still. Editorials and  X  X  X ot-topic X  X  articles contain many more expressions of private states, requiring an annotator to make more judgments than he or she would have to for articles about objective topics. various aspects of the annotation scheme. 6.3.1. Measuring Agreement for Text Spans The first step in measuring agreement is to verify that annotators do indeed agree on which expressions should be marked. To illustrate this agreement problem, consider the words and phrases identified by annotators A and M in example (26). Text anchors for direct subjective frames are in italics; text anchors for expressive subjective elements are in bold. (26)
A: We applauded this move because it was not only just , but it made us
M: We applauded this move because it was not only just, but it made us begin [ X  X  X sraeli Arab Leaders to fight cut in Child Allowances, X  X  2002-04-23, By David Rudge, The Jerusalem Post, Jerusalem, Israel] In this sentence, the two annotators mostly agree on which expressions to annotate. Both annotators agree that  X  X  X pplauded X  X  and  X  X  X egin to feel X  X  express private states and that  X  X  X ot only just X  X  is an expressive subjective element. However, in addition to these text spans, annotator M also marked the words  X  X  X ecause X  X  and  X  X  X ut X  X  as expressive subjective elements. The annotators also did not completely agree about the extent of the expressive subjective element beginning with  X  X  X ntegral. X  X  when measuring agreement for text spans. First, how should we define agreement for cases when annotators identify the same expression in the text, but differ in their marking of the expression boundaries? This occurred in (26) when A identified word  X  X  X ntegral X  X  and M identified the overlapping phrase  X  X  X ntegral part. X  X  The second question to address is which statistic is appropriate for measuring agreement between annotation sets that disagree w.r.t. the presence or absence of individual annotations.
 agreement in the annotation instructions, nor was boundary agreement stressed during training. For our purposes, we believed that it was most important that annotators identified the same general expression, and that boundary agreement was secondary. Thus, for this agreement study, we consider overlapping text spans, such as  X  X  X ntegral X  X  and  X  X  X ntegral part X  X  in (26), to be matches.
 that the annotators will identify the same set of expressions. In (26), the set of expressive subjective elements identified by A is { X  X  X ot only just X  X ,  X  X  X nte-gral X  X  X . The set of expressive subjective elements identified by M is { X  X  X ecause X  X ,  X  X  X ot only just X  X ,  X  X  X ut X  X ,  X  X  X ntegral part X  X  X . Thus, to measure agreement we want to consider how much intersection there is between the sets of expressions identified by the annotators. Contrast this annotation task with, for example, word sense annotation, where annotators are guar-anteed to annotate exactly the same sets of objects (all instances of the words being sense tagged). Because the annotators will annotate different expres-sions, we use the agr metric rather than Kappa ( j ) to measure agreement in identifying text anchors.
 annotated by annotators a and b , respectively. agr is a directional measure of agreement that measures what proportion of A was also marked by b . Specifically, we compute the agreement of b to a as: b the system, and to precision, if b is the gold standard and a the system. 6.3.2. Agreement for Expressive Subjective Element Text Anchors In the 210 sentences in the annotation study, the annotators A, M, and S respectively marked 311, 352 and 249 expressive subjective elements. Table III shows the pairwise agreement for these sets of annotations. For example, M agrees with 76% of the expressive subjective elements marked by A, and A agrees with 72% of the expressive subjective elements marked by M. The average agreement in Table III is the arithmetic mean of all six agrs. likely the annotators are to agree. To test this hypothesis, we measure agreement for the expressive subjective elements rated with an intensity of medium or higher by at least one annotator. This excludes on average 29% of the expressive subjective elements. The average pairwise agreement rises to 0.80. When measuring agreement for the expressive subjective elements rated high or extreme, this excludes an average 65% of expressive subjective ele-ments, and the average pairwise agreement increases to 0.88. Thus, annota-tors are more likely to agree when the expression of subjectivity is strong. Table IV gives a sample of expressive subjective elements marked with intensity high or extreme by two or more annotators. 6.3.3. Agreement for Direct Subjective and Objective Speech Event Text This section measures agreement, collectively, for the text anchors of objective speech event and direct subjective frames. For ease of reference, in this section we will refer to these frames collectively as explicit frames. 8 For the agreement measured in this section, frame type is ignored. The next section measures agreement between annotators in distinguishing objective speech events from direct subjective frames.
 to measure agreement for the text anchors of explicit frames. The three annotators, A, M, and S, respectively identified 338, 285, and 315 explicit frames in the data. Table V shows the pairwise agreement for these sets of annotations. The average pairwise agreement for the text spans of explicit frames is 0.82, which indicates that they are easier to annotate than expres-sive subjective elements. 6.3.4. Agreement Distinguishing between Objective Speech Event and Direct In this section, we focus on inter-rater agreement for judgments that reflect whether or not an opinion, emotion, or other private state is being expressed. We measure agreement for these judgments by considering how well the annotators agree in distinguishing between objective speech event frames and direct subjective frames. We consider this distinction to be a key aspect of the annotation scheme  X  a higher-level judgment of subjectivity versus objectivity than what is typically made for individual expressive subjective elements.

Let S1 intersection be all the frames in S1 all such that the same way. The analysis in this section involves the frames S1 intersection and S2 intersection , and the two matching frames reference the same expression in the text. For each matching pair of frames then, we are interested in determining whether the annotators agree on the type of frame  X  is it an objective speech event or a direct subjective frame? Because the set of expressions being evalu-ated is the same, we use Kappa ( j ) to measure agreement.

 expect that there are clear cases as well as borderline cases that are more difficult to judge. This seems to be the case with sentence (27) above. Both annotators agree that there is a strong private state being expressed by the speech event  X  X  X aid. X  X  But the speech event for  X  X  X iting X  X  is less clear. One annotator sees only an objective speech event. The other annotator sees a weak expression of a private state (the intensity and expression intensity ratings in the frame are low). Indeed, the agreement results provide evidence that there are borderline cases for objective versus subjective speech events. Consider the expressions referenced by the frames in S1 intersection and S2 intersection . We consider an expression to be borderline subjective if (1) at least one annotator marked the expression with a direct subjective frame and (2) neither annotator characterized its intensity as being greater than low. For example,  X  X  X iting X  X  in sentence (27) is borderline subjective. In sentence (28) below, the expression  X  X  X bserved X  X  is also borderline subjective, whereas the expression  X  X  X ould not like X  X  is not. The objective speech event and direct subjective frames identified by both annotators M and S are also given below. (28)  X  X  X he US authorities would not like to have it [Mexico] as a trading Table VII but with the frames for the borderline subjective expressions removed. This removes, on average, only 10% of the expressions. When these are removed, the average pairwise j climbs to 0.89.
 6.3.5. Agreement for Sentences In this section, we use the annotators X  low-level frame annotations to derive sentence-level judgments, and we measure agreement for those judgments. tive for two reasons. First, objective speech event and direct subjective frames that were excluded from consideration in Section 6.3.4 because they were identified by only one annotator 10 may now be included. Second, having sentence-level judgments enables us to compare agreement for our annota-tions with previously published results (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999).
 lower-level frame annotations as follows. First, we exclude the objective speech event and direct subjective frames that both annotators marked as insubstantial . Then, for each sentence, let an annotator X  X  judgment for that sentence be subjective if the annotator created one or more direct subjective frames in the sentence; otherwise, let the judgment for the sentence be objective .
 tions are given in Table IX. The average pairwise Kappa for sentence-level agreement is 0.77, 8 points higher than the sentence-level agreement reported in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999). Our new results suggest that adding detail to the annotation task can can help annotators perform more reliably.
 we again test whether removing borderline cases improves agreement. We define a sentence to be borderline subjective if (1) at least one annotator marked at least one direct subjective frame in the sentence, and (2) neither annotator marked a direct subjective frame with an intensity greater than low. When borderline subjective sentences are removed, on average only 11% of sentences, the average Kappa increases to 0.87. 7. Related Work Many different fields have contributed to the large body of work on opinion-ated and emotional language, including linguistics, literary theory, psychology, philosophy, and content analysis. From these fields come a wide variety of relevant terminology: subjectivity, affect, evidentiality, stance, propositional attitudes, opaque contexts, appraisal, point of view, etc. We have adopted the term  X  X  X rivate state X  X  from (Quirk et al ., 1985) as a general covering term for internal states, as mentioned above in Section 2. At times in general discussion, we use the words  X  X  X pinions X  X  and  X  X  X motions X  X  (these terms cover many types of private states). From literary theory, we adopt the term  X  X  X ubjectivity X  X  (Banfield, 1982) to refer to the linguistic expression of private states. While a comprehensive survey of research in subjectivity and language is outside the scope ofthis paper,this section sketchesthe work mostdirectly relevant to ours. project in automatically tracking point of view in narrative (Wiebe, 1994). This model was, in turn, based on work in literary theory and linguistics, most directly Dolez  X  el (1973), Uspensky (1973), Kuroda (1973, 1976), Chat-man (1978), Cohn (1978), Fodor (1979), and Banfield (1982). Our work capturing nested levels of attribution ( X  X  X ested sources X  X ) was inspired by work on propositional attitudes and belief spaces in artificial intelligence (Wilks and Bien, 1983; Asher, 1986; Rapaport, 1986) and linguistics (Fodor, 1979; Fauconnier, 1985).
 and emotions has been argued by a number of researchers in linguistics (e.g., Labov (1984) and Martin (2000)) and psychology (e.g., Osgood et al . (1957) and Heise (1965)). In psychology, there is a long tradition of using manually compiled emotion lexicons in experiments to help develop or support various models of emotion. One line of research (e.g., Osgood et al . (1957), Heise (1965), Russell (1980), and Watson and Tellegen (1985)) uses factor analysis to determine dimensions 1l for characterizing emotion. Others (e.g., de Rivera (1977), Ortony et al . (1987), and Johnson-Laird and Oatley (1989)) develop taxonomies of emotions. Our goals and the goals of these works in psy-chology are quite different  X  we are not interested in building models or taxonomies of emotion. Nevertheless, there is room for cross pollination. The corpus that we have developed, with words and expressions of attitudes and emotions marked in context, might be a good resource to aid in lexicon creation. Similarly, the various typologies of attitude proposed in the liter-ature might be informative for refining our annotation scheme in the future. Theory (Martin, 2000; White, 2002) for analyzing evaluation and stance in discourse. Appraisal Theory emerged from the field of systemic functional linguistics (see Halliday (1994) and Martin (1992)). The Appraisal framework is composed of the following concepts (or systems in the terminology of sys-temic functional linguistics): Affect, Judgment, Appreciation, Engagement, and Amplification. Affect, Judgment, and Appreciation represent different types of positive and negative attitudes. Engagement distinguishes various types of  X  X  X ntersubjective positioning X  X  such as attribution and expectation. Amplification considers the force and focus of the attitudes being expressed. concerned with systematically identifying expressions of opinions and emo-tions in context, below the level of the sentence. However, the two schemes have a different focus. The Appraisal framework primarily distinguishes different types of private state (e.g., affect versus judgment), and the typology of attitude types it proposes is much richer than ours. Currently, we only consider polarity. On the other hand, Appraisal Theory does not distinguish, as we do, the different ways that private states may be expressed (i.e., directly, or indirectly using expressive subjective elements). The Appraisal framework also does not include a representation for nested levels of attri-bution.
 has also been performed in Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003), Bruce and Wiebe (1999), and Wiebe et al . (2004). The annotation schemes used in Bruce and Wiebe (1999) and Wiebe et al . (2004) are earlier, less detailed versions of the annotation scheme presented in this paper.
 tions; the annotations in Wiebe et al . (2004) mark only the texts spans of expressive subjective elements. In contrast to the detailed, expression-level annotations of our current scheme, the annotations from Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) are sentence level, subjective versus objective and polarity judgments.
 compiling lists of words and judging the words as to their polarity, strength, or any number of other factors of subjective language. The goals of these works are wide ranging. Osgood et al . (1957) and Heise (1965, 2001), for example, aim to develop dimensional models of affect. In work by Hart (1984), Anderson and McMaster (1982), Biber and Finegan (1989), Subasic and Heuttner (2001), and others, the lexicons are used to automatically characterize political texts, literature, news, and other types of discourse, along various subjective lines. Recent work by Kaufer et al . (2004) is note-worthy. In a multiyear project, judges compiled lists of strings that  X  X  X rime X  X  readers with respect to various categories, including many subjectivity cate-gories. Although the lexicons that result from these works are valuable, they fail to capture, as our annotation scheme does, how subjective language is used in context in the documents where it appears.
 guistic annotation scheme both the concept of private states and the concept of nested sources, and applies the scheme comprehensively to a large corpus, with the goal of annotating expressions in context, below the level of the sentence. 8. Future Work The main goal behind the annotation scheme presented in this paper is to support the development and evaluation of NLP systems that exploit knowledge of opinions in applications. We have recently begun a project to incorporate knowledge of opinions into automatic question answering sys-tems. The goals are to automatically extract the frames of our annotation scheme from text, using the annotated data for training and testing, and then to incorporate the extracted information into a summary representation of opinions that will summarize the opinions expressed in a document or group of documents (Cardie et al ., 2003). Building the summary representations will force us to address questions such as which private states are similar to each other, and which source agents in a text are presented as sharing the same opinion (Bergler, 1992). Initial results in this project are described in Wilson et al . (2004) and Breck and Cardie (2004).
 involves the attitude type attribute. Drawing on work in linguistics, psy-chology, and content analysis in attitude typologies (e.g., Ortony et al . (1987), Johnson-Laird and Oatley (1989), Martin (2000), White (2002), and Kaufer et al . (2004)), we will refine the attitude type attribute to include subtypes such as emotion, warning, stance, uncertainty, condition, cognition, intention, and evaluation. The values will include polarity values and degrees of certainty, enabling us to distinguish among, for example, positive emo-tions, negative evaluations, strong certainty, and weak uncertainty. A single private state frame will potentially include more than one attitude type and value, since a single expression often implies multiple types of attitudes. There has already been a fair amount of work developing typologies of attitude and emotion types, as mentioned above. Our research goal is not to develop a new typology. Our hope is that including a richer set of attitude types in our corpus annotations will contribute to a new understanding of how attitudes of various types and in various combinations are expressed linguistically in context.
 annotation of targets. To date, only a limited set are annotated, as described above in Section 2. We will include targets that are entities who are not agents, as well as propositional targets (e.g.,  X  X  X ary is sweet X  X  in  X  X  X ohn believes that Mary is sweet X  X ). Frames with more than one type of attitude may contain more than one target, reflecting, for example, that a phrase expresses a negative evaluation toward one thing and a positive evaluation toward another.
 and knowledge into the representation. This will involve not only the pre-sumed relationship between the writer and his or her readership, but also relationships among agents mentioned in the text. For example, a quoted speaker may have spoken to a group which is quite different from the intended audience of the article. Work in narratology (Onega and Landes, 1996) will be informative for addressing such issues.
 ideology must be considered. Our annotation scheme focuses on explicit linguistic expressions of private states. As such, other manifestations of point of view, bias, and ideology, such as bias reflected in which events in a story are mentioned and which roles are assigned to the participants (e.g., insurgent versus soldier ), are outside the purview of our annotation scheme. Even so, a promising area of investigation would be corpus studies of interactions among these various factors. 9. Conclusions This paper described a detailed annotation scheme that identifies key com-ponents and properties of opinions and emotions in language. The scheme pulls together into one linguistic annotation scheme both the concept of private states and the concept of nested sources, and applies the scheme comprehensively to a large corpus, with the goal of annotating expressions in context, below the level of the sentence. Several examples illustrating the scheme were given, and a corpus annotation project was described, including the results of an interannotator agreement study. The annotated corpus is freely available at http://nrrc.mitre.org/N-RRC/publications.htm. We hope this work will be useful to others working in corpus-based explorations of subjective language and that it will encourage NLP researchers to experiment with subjective language in their applications.
