 The Internet has become an indispensable t ool to find information with instantaneous results using any one of the existing search engines. However, today's search engines still suffer from recall and precision problems [12]. Therefore, it is desirable for searchers to use different search engines and also explore collections of documents that are not written in their native languages. Much research in recent years has been devoted to meta-search and multilingual search to increase the scope of the search and to improve search performance. The main research issues being how one would translate the monolingual query into various languages to retrieve documents from multilingual collections, and merge the results from multiple lists of returned items of different languages into a singly ranked list. 
This naturally leads to wider research areas, venues, and issues, since most existing web search algorithms are originally developed for English web documents, one would question the efficiency and performance of these techniques if they are applied directly to documents of other languages. For instance, should the same algorithm be used for relevance ranking in each of the selected collections of a meta-multilingual search? Perhaps it would better to use different or modified algorithms developed for the specific language of each collection, select the most relevant items, and then merge these into a ranked list. 
In this work, we have chosen Chinese web search and document processing for our study. The number of Chinese web pages has increased dramatically in the past few years and it is expected that the majority of web pages will be written in Chinese in the very near future. In 1997, there were only 300,000 computers connected to the Internet in China. Today, there are more than 87 million users browsing close to 600,000 web sites and 5.4 million pages, with about 1.2 million domain names [2]. Another survey has shown that China ranks second in the world in Internet user population. With only 8% of the Chinese population currently online, this projects a huge potential market for the Chinese Internet services [4]. 
Of the three main areas of web information retrieval and analysis, content mining is the most difficult for the Chinese language as compared to structure and usage mining. This has a direct impact on the quality of the search results. There are several issues that make Chinese web search and document processing much more difficult than that of the English web. First, there are many different character sets and encoding schemes in use, depending on the geographic region of the web site and the political preference of the author. Big Five (BIG5) or Dawu , the traditional Chinese character set, is used in Taiwan and Hong Kong. In China, GB or Guojia Biaozhun (National Standard), is used to represent simplified Chinese characters. Increasingly, new web sites either use GBK, Guojia Biaozhun Kuozhan (Extended National Standard), or the multilingual Unicode Standard, both of which contain a larger character set that includes GB and BIG5 [5]. 
The second problem associated with Chinese language processing is that there is no white space between words as in the English language. Depending on how one reads a sentence or combine the separate characters, it is possible to have multiple valid interpretations of a phrase or sentence. Th erefore, Chinese word (or character, bigram, trigram, etc.) segmentation is very difficult and has remained as an open research English language based web search algorithms a challenge. The effectiveness of the term extraction process, the clustering of similar documents, and the categorization of documents affect the search engine provider X  X  capability of indexing its document base, and providing good summarization in an optim al fashion [16]. In addition, the white space problem at the query level dictates how accurate the matching, and the translation if multilingual databases are used, will be. 
From the authors X  experience, the irrelevance (and hence the proper ranking) of many of the search results is quite prominent. Low precision and low recall are particularly acute in Chinese web search. The low recall problem is due to low coverage of the web by many Chinese search engines. In addition, the returned lists  X  X sunami X  from five popular Chinese search engines). It is evident that these engines differ from one and other in their methodology to index relevant information, and approach to rank the results relevancy to the query. We speculate that these problems are partly caused by applying existing English based algorithms to Chinese documents. 
To explore the Chinese web characteristics, we have performed some exploratory experiments on Chinese web graphs and their link structures. Throughout this work, we use six web graphs chosen from our experiments (three randomly selected sites from China and three randomly selected sites fr om North America) as typical cases to sites used. For illustration purpose, we only present the first three layers of each web graph. Thus, layer 1 is the root node, layer 2 contains the nodes referenced by the root node, and layer 3 has the nodes linked from layer 2 nodes. The size of the each web graph is shown in Table 3 . 
Section 2 of this work examines existing web mining techniques and their suitability to be used in Chinese web search. Potential issues and problems in applying well-known English language based algorithms will be identified. In order to build a better Chinese search engine, one must use a hybrid approach by combining various effective techniques, as we argue in Section 3. Finally, current status and work in progress are presented in Section 4. In the web mining process, many techniques originating from the data mining area are used to discover and extract information from web documents. It should be noted that most of the web mining techniques existing today are originally developed for English language search engines. Most of the non-English search engines still employ to certain extent, if not all, some aspects of resource finding, information extraction, or ranking techniques used in English search engines. An example would be the various Google engines used in different languages, which essentially utilize the same PageRank algorithm as the regular (English) Google search engine [1]. 2.1 Resource Finding a nd Informatio n Selection Many well-developed approaches and techniques are used to retrieve as many relevant classification and categorization, user feedback interfaces, and data visualization. These techniques are language independent and, therefore, could be applied directly to documents written in any language. 
From the retrieved documents, relevant information is extracted. This is important, as only appropriate information should be presented to the users. For unstructured data within a document, linguistic approaches are necessary to perform syntactic and semantic analysis on the textual information. However, these analyses necessitate algorithms that are specifically developed for the Chinese language. In this case, English based algorithms must be modified, if they are to be used at all. 
Information can also be obtained from semi-structured data by analyzing meta-information embedded in the document, such as HTML tags, headings, and delimiters. Some research has been focused on automated adaptive algorithms using machine learning techniques. For example, Kushmerick [13] and Muslea [17] focus on  X  X rapper induction X , where documents to be processed are highly regular, such as the HTML text emitted by CGI scripts. These approaches may be less dependent on the language the document is written in; however, the performance is affected by how the document creator configures its meta-inf ormation, and therefore the information selected may not be reliable. 
Hybrid approaches have also been proposed to extract both unstructured natural texts and semi-structured regular text [7][9][18]. This combination of examining meta-information, as well as analyzing the content of the document would be the best approach for extracting information from Chinese documents, though one needs to develop algorithms based on the linguistic rules concerning the syntax and semantics of the Chinese language. 2.2 Information Analysis The main objective of information analysis is to examine and rank the selected documents according to their relevance to the query. There are many ranking algorithms in existence. Most techniques are of a statistical natural to estimate a document X  X  relevance ranking. The frequency of the keyword appearance in the document is often used as one of the major factors in most methods to estimate a document X  X  relevance. The technique of using a relevance factor such as query density X  X he ratio of the number of keywords over the total number of words in the document X  X hould work well in ranking Chinese documents as long as the query is simple. Complex and long queries would aggregate the Chinese white space problem, and hence the accuracy of the index terms used as a result of poor query segmentation. 
Another popular relevance parameter used is a weighted factor or priority on a specific set of documents. For example, academic documents such as published papers may be ranked before other items that contain the same search word. This method, though, may have limited applicability in the Chinese web environment. We have observed that most of the published papers indexed by Chinese search engines are articles found on the Chinese web, and may not be reviewed or rigorously researched as the ones appearing in formal academic publications. 
Visiting frequency is also used as a relevance determining factor; for example, the method proposed by Craswell et al. [7] requires a database being maintained on the frequently visited should be more useful; thus they should have higher rankings than others. This ranking technique is language independent and, therefore, appears to work well for web searches in different languages. Upon deeper examination, this method may not be appropriate in the Chinese web setting. The majority of the Chinese web sites are devoted to specific purposes, in particular, entertainment (e.g., movie ratings, mp3 downloads, chats and blogs, etc.) an d consumer information (e.g., electronic product ratings, pricing comparisons, etc.) These web sites tend to have a higher frequency of visits than other official web sites run by professional organizations, reputable national corporations, and governments. 
To locate properly researched and formal information, referrals from an entertainment web site may not be the best resources. For instance, using a president X  X  name as the query, the president X  X  biography from an academic site would provide more accurate and valuable information than reviews found on an entertainment web site for a movie about the president; however, the entertainment web site would certainly have a higher rank due to its higher frequency of visits. This is also true for news sites as ranking algorithm with frequency of visits as a prime relevancy decision factor will give top ranking priority to news sites than to academic or government sites, though for some information seekers, news web sites may provide little or no useful information as to what they are looking for. The popularity of news and entertainment sites is evident from the top ranked items shown in Table 1. 
In our exploratory investigation, we have also observed that Chinese entertainment web sites tend to reference other entertainment sites; similarly, a news web site has a majority of its external links to sites of the same type. 
In contrast, North American web sites seem to be more diversified in their external links. As can be observed from Table 4 , this is indeed the general case. Both E2 and E3 presented as atypical cases. 2.3 The Google PageRank Algorithm The Google PageRank algorithm by Page and Brin [1] is the most well known algorithm in ranking document relevance. Each web page X  X  ranking is mainly determined by the characteristics of its inbound and outbound links. This approach makes sense, as link analysis provides a very reasonable measurement of how important a web page is as regarded by its peers. However, this may not be the case in the Chinese web setting, as only a small percentage of the Chinese population is actively involved in designing web pages. Moreover, we have observed that Chinese web pages reference each other in a more concentrated fashion, usually within a close-knit community, as supported by other researchers [15]. For example, a research group at a university would make links to other research groups within the same school. 
Fig. 1 shows the percentage of external links over the total number of links of each web graph. It is evident that the North Amer ican sites make a large number of external references as compared to the Chinese sites. Here, we define internal links as reference back to the same site, or the same organization, i.e., sites that have the same top-level and second-level domains in their URLs. For instance, www.ece.uvic.ca and www.cs.uvic.ca belong to the same organization. Indeed, our exploratory investigation shows that most Chinese web graphs have the majority of their links clustered internally within the first three to four layers of the root node. 
Thus, using link structure analysis to estimate ranking would not be meaningful, as the inbound and outbound links do not provide significant weights as defined in the PageRank algorithm. When applying relevance ranking algorithms to Chinese documents, one needs to examine further the bilateral referencing relationship among the pages to eliminate any biasing effect. 
Furthermore, ranking parameters may also be affected by cultural discrepancy due to geographical differences, thus rendering the ranking algorithm less effective. China is a large country with many provinces, and each ethnic group has its own dialect, religion, and way of living. These differences, no matter how subtle, may affect how Chinese people think and design web pages. (In our exploratory investigation, we have not, so other countries such as Canada and the United States, where the cultural environment from one province or state to another does not differ greatly due to the homogeneity of the population and the identifiable national culture. Therefore, it is important that Chinese web mining algorithms must consider these differences in localized cultures. 2.4 Suitability of Existing English Based Algorithms for Chinese Web Mining From our brief qualitative and exploratory quantitative analysis, it can be concluded that due to the complexity of the Chinese language, as well as the Chinese web culture, methods and techniques originally developed for English based search engines cannot be used directly in the development of Chinese web search, for performance and efficiency reasons. However, they can be used as frameworks with additional processing such as physically retrieving the documents, or at least the summaries, for further content analysis, to ensure the quality and relevance of the documents ranked. 
In the Chinese language, a word may have some very close synonyms. A highly relevant document could be reached using a synonym of the query. This necessitates a thesaurus approach, while incorporating user feedback mechanisms. Also, one must pay attention to the meaning of the query for different implications. A Chinese noun quite often can be used as a verb or an adjective. Simply counting the frequency of the important in information analysis, as there is arguably more complexity in the Chinese language and its representation. 
There have been some methods and techniques discussed in an attempt to achieve a more effective Chinese web mining proce ss. Several useful concepts have been proposed on Chinese document indexing and retrieval models. Interested readers should refer to the excellent survey by Luk and Kwok [16]. In order to develop an characteristics of the syntax and semantics of the Chinese language are necessary. There are currently more than three hundred active Chinese search engines [3]. Most of these engines X  databases are relatively small, some are specialized engines searching for focused information such as consumer electronics or entertainment, and others are simply powered by the bigger search engines including the Big Fives: Google China (http://www.google.com/intl/zh-CN), Yahoo Yisou (http://www.yisou.com), Zhongsou (http://www.zhongsou.com), Baidu (http;//www.baidu.com) and Tianwang (http:// e.pku.edu.cn). These engines work reasonably well and are very popular among Chinese users [14]. However, until English based mining algorithms are modified and better web mining techniques are develope d specifically for Chinese web search, we have no choice but to utilize the current search capabilities to bring to the users the best results obtainable. 
We have performed various experiments in Chinese web search. One particularly illustrative case is shown in Table 1. A query of  X  X sunami X  in Chinese was used for a simple search on the Big Fives. We found minimal overlaps in the returned results from each engine. For illustrative purpose, Table 1 only shows the top five items from each engine. Among the sixteen distinct documents, only one appears in all five lists. One observations that these search engines may be using different relevance ranking algorithms, and the avoidable fact that they only have partial overlapped coverage in their indexed databases. 
In contrast, web sites in North America exhibit different characteristics. The top five items from four of the major search engines, Yahoo, Google, AltaVista, and MSN, show more overlaps when the English word  X  X sunami X  was used as a query, as shown in Table 5 . There are nine distinct documents as compared to the sixteen found in Chinese search. One interesting artifact is that four distinct URLs, all with the same top-level and second-level domains (i.e., washington.edu), point to the exact same web page; hence, we consider these four URLs as one single document. This item appears in all search engines X  top five list. Two items appear in three of the four lists and two other items appear in two lists. Only two out of the nine documents do not have a replicate in another engine X  X  result list. Moreover, if the lists of the top ten items are considered, a much higher overlap is observed among the four North American search engines. The same, though, cannot be said of the Chinese search engines. 
This difference in overlap characteristic between Chinese and North American search engines suggests that either the English engines use very similar merging and ranking algorithms, and/or their crawlers s earch similar web space. This characteristic deserves further investigation. 
For the Chinese search engines case, all items from Tianwang do not appear in any other search engine X  X  results. Most of the sixteen documents are news items. In addition, some results are blog or forum pages. (In contrast, only one item is of a blog difficult, if not impossible, to judge which Chinese engine provides highly relevant results. Moreover, relevance ranking seems to be a formidable task due to the subjectivity of individual users. 
Furthermore, commercial secrets and a lack of published information prevent us from analyzing the mining techniques used by these engines, and evaluating them accordingly. However, two definitive conclusions can be drawn: 1. Meta-search is a necessity due to the low coverage of the Chinese engines and the complexity of the Chinese language, and 2. An accurate and reliable ranking system may be irrelevant or immaterial, as the onus of selecting the most useful items should be more appropriately placed on the users. 
We propose taking advantage of many of the current best practices used in Chinese web search, using meta-search as a foundation, with ideas borrowed from multilingual information retrieval, user feedbacks, and visualization, etc. 3.1 Adapting Meta-search Technology In an environment where a large number of search servers are available, a meta-search increases the scope and the quality of the search. There are many English language based meta-search engines available with varying degree of success. Some of these engines incorporate a collectio n selection process to identify the most promising search equally. As for the documents retrieved from each individual search engine, equal proportional to the quality of the documents retrieved from each collection historically. 
The most challenging task in a meta-search is the merging of the selected documents into a singly ranked list. Most merging algorithms are statistics based and incorporate information are used to compute the final global rank of a document. A conclusion that can be drawn from the previous result overlap comparison is that fusion algorithms that work well to merge results from English search engines may have to be modified, to take the minimal overlap characteristic into account, when used in merging Chinese overlap-weighted merging algorithms. On the other hand, as we argued earlier, an irrelevant to have a ranked list, as users are highly subjective in their opinion of how relevant an item is to the query. 
In China, there are many web search engines that claim to perform meta-search. We have examined over forty such engines including the well-known ones such as metaFisher, 9om.com, eNo1.com, bestdh.com, etc. We found that many of these are unusable due to poor user interface and extremely slow access. Many of them are paid service, or simply serve as a portal to other popular web search engines. The only exception that we noted is Wideway Search (www.widewaysearch.com). This meta-search engine performs reasonably well, but we could not find any information regarding how the search is done and how the merged ranking is determined. Moreover, this site specifies that it is a beta test version, which has not been updated since 2000. 
The current status of Chinese meta-search engines shows that there is room for improvement. There is also strong evidence to support our proposal of using meta-search as a basis for better Chinese web search. 3.2 Adapting Mult ilingual Information Retrieval Technology In multilingual information retrieval, the most common approach to create appropriate queries is the use of a multilingual dictionary. The translated query is then submitted to search engines of different languages. This dictionary idea can be used in processing ambiguous query in the Chinese language. Jin and Wong have explored a possible Chinese dictionary approach for information retrieval [11]. The best place to deploy the dictionary approach is at the query entry le vel. Instead of mapping translated queries, common words or phrases associated with the entered character to facilitate the accurate entry of the desired query. Furthermore, synonym selection can be presented to users based on a thesaurus during query input. This is similar to the mechanism of the pinyin automatic Chinese keyword conversion system used in Google. Concepts and specification from the World Wide Web Consortium Internationalization Activity X  X  annotation system for phonetic transcription, widely used for Asian languages, that appears near the corresponding characters. Common phrases and synonyms can be displayed with the keyed-in query for user selection. This has the additional benefit of serving as an intelligent guide to those users who may have problems conceptualizing and pinpointing the exact query to use. We are currently conducting extensive experiments pertaining to the analysis of applying English based algorithms to Chinese documents. We expect that the results will support the conclusions from our qualitative and exploratory quantitative analysis reported here, that many English based algorithms would not work well in the Chinese web setting. 
The backbone of a meta-search engine utilizing the Big Five Chinese search engines has been designed and implemented. Advanced user interface and search features are currently being developed. We are also working on the specification for an intelligent agent to facilitate user query input.
