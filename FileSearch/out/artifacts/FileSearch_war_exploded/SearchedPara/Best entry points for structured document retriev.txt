 1. Introduction
Document collections often display hierarchical structural characteristics. For example, a report may contain sections and subsections, each of which is composed of paragraphs. Structural information can be exploited at the presentation stage by presenting only selected document components in the interface, rather than all relevant document components: this approach, known as focussed retrieval , is the topic of this paper.
Focussed retrieval acknowledges the importance of users  X  natural browsing behaviour, and combines the browsing and querying paradigms to return best entry points to structured documents. In this paper, fol-lowing from the work of Chiaramella, Mulhem, and Fourel (1996) in the context of hypermedia multimedia retrieval, a best entry point (BEP) is defined as a document component from which the user can obtain opti-mal access, by browsing, to relevant document components. The use of BEPs in place of relevant document components as the basic units of the results list is intended to support the information searching behaviour of users, and enable them to gain more effective and efficient access to relevant information items. In Reid, Lalmas, Finesilver, and Hertzum (2005) , we described the methodology and results of a study of BEP characteristics that was carried out on the Shakespeare test collection ( Kazai, Lalmas, &amp; Reid, 2003 ).
This test collection consists of a structured document collection, a set of queries adapted to the structured document retrieval (SDR) task, and sets of corresponding relevance assessments and BEPs elicited from experimental participants. Results analysis focussed on the relationship of BEPs to relevant objects (ROs) and agreement between experimental participants, and was performed across different query catego-ries (factual/essay-topic; content-only/content-and-structure). Some preliminary findings from a small-scale experimental study using the INEX 2002 data were also presented.

This work showed that the concept of BEP is an intuitive one and that BEPs have a character distinct from that of ROs, introduced by the structural nature of the documents and queries. BEPs were often cho-sen at the same structural level as, or the level immediately above, the ROs, although this was not always the case in the INEX study. The results with regard to BEP agreement were inconsistent between the Shake-speare study and the INEX study. The results with regard to query category showed that essay-topic and content-only queries usually produced consistent results close to average values, while factual queries exhi-bited atypical behaviour and content-and-structure queries exhibited inconsistent behaviour for many of the factors we examined.

In order to explore the practical application of our findings from this study, we then carried out a further study that involved the development of a set of simple heuristics that could be used to identify BEPs from
ROs, and their application to the relevance assessments from the Shakespeare study in order to derive BEPs automatically ( Lalmas &amp; Reid, 2003 ). Analysis of the results of the experiment suggests that such simple rules are not sufficient, singly at least, to explain the identification of BEPs from ROs. The process of encod-ing human criteria for BEP selection is clearly very complex, and the different characteristics of individual query categories appear to provide a further complicating factor.
 In parallel, Finesilver and Reid (2003) examined and compared the usage and effectiveness of BEPs and
ROs for a single query category, namely essay-topic, content-only queries. One of the main findings of this study was that different queries belonging to the same query category elicited different information search-ing behaviour. Where an optimal strategy was employed, participants achieved better task performance using BEPs than ROs. From observation of the experiment and examination of the software logs, it ap-peared that failure to adopt an optimal strategy could be at least partially attributed to the inconsistent nature of the BEPs. Two different BEP types were identified: browsing BEPs (defined as  X  X  X he first object in a sequence of relevant objects X  X ) and container BEPs (defined as  X  X (real or virtual) objects which contained several relevant objects X  X ).

Taken together, the findings from all these studies suggest that further work is required to shed more light on the complex nature of BEPs and the process of deriving them from ROs. This work is the subject of this paper, and focuses on two main themes: (1) A more detailed examination of the Shakespeare data, in particular exploring the concept of BEP types ; and (2) An empirical study of the usage and effectiveness of BEPs in real information search tasks.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we describe our study of BEP types. We propose a categorisation of BEP types and examine the characteristics of these types across query categories and participants. In Section 3, we describe our study of BEP usage and effectiveness in the context of real information searching tasks, again analysed across query categories. In Section 4, we relate these findings to the small-scale user study we carried out using the INEX data set ( Fuhr, Malik, &amp; Lalmas, 2004 ). We con-clude the paper with a summary of our findings and proposals for future work in Section 5. 2. BEP types
In Finesilver and Reid (2003) , it was observed that there were at least two different types of BEPs: brows-ing BEPs, which were defined as the first object in a sequence of relevant objects, and container BEPs, which were defined as (real or virtual) objects that contain several relevant objects. In this section, we pro-pose a full categorisation of BEP types (Section 2.1) and examine the characteristics of these types across query categories and participants (Section 2.2). Our overall findings are discussed in Section 2.3. 2.1. BEP type definitions Categorisation of BEP types was performed retrospectively, based on the following data:
Experimental observations, participant interviews and analysis of software logs from the user experiment that led to construction of the Shakespeare test collection.

Experimental observations and analysis of software logs from the user experiment described in Finesilver and Reid (2003) .

Common-sense, intuitive analysis of the Shakespeare test collection data, i.e. attempting to identify pat-terns in the relationship of BEPs to ROs, using such factors as structural level and sequences of consec-utive relevant and non-relevant objects.
 Five types of BEPs were identified and can be defined as follows:
Relevance judgement (RJ): An RJ BEP is identical to a relevance judgement for that query. Therefore, it is, by definition, a leaf-level BEP.

Browsing (Br): A browsing BEP is the first relevant object in a sequence of relevant objects intended to be accessed from that BEP. Therefore, it is, by definition, a leaf-level BEP. There may be non-relevant objects within the sequence; however, the non-relevant objects should not span more than a fixed thresh-old. A reasonable threshold in this instance was determined to be two speeches.

Container (Cntnr): A container BEP is a higher-level object that contains at least one relevant object.
 Combination (Comb): A combination BEP combines the characteristics of browsing and container BEPs.
It is a higher-level object that contains at least one relevant object, and is the first of a sequence of similar objects at the same structural level.

Context (Cntxt): A context BEP is a non-relevant object at any structural level that is intended to pro-vide contextual information for a relevant object, or series of relevant objects, that follows it. 2.2. Results and analysis
In our analysis, we examine the distribution of BEP types and, for each BEP, the number of leaf-level objects that are accessible, the percentage of the total number of accessible objects composed of relevant objects, and the percentage of the total number of relevant objects composed of accessible objects. Analysis was performed across query categories using (non-merged) unique BEPs and across participants using non-unique BEPs, and average values were calculated accordingly.

Firstly, we examined the distribution of BEP types across query categories ( Table 1 ). Overall, there was a similar proportion of browsing and container BEPs, and very few context BEPs. For factual queries, the most common BEP type was browsing, which may be due to the fact that such queries are usually answered by a small, often consecutive, number of leaf-level objects. For content-and-structure queries, container
BEPs were the most common type, which may be due to the addition of a structural constraint, often explicitly indicating a higher-level object.

We also examined the distribution of BEP types for individual participants ( Table 2 ). The overall pattern of distribution of BEP types is very similar for non-unique BEPs: browsing and container BEPs are the most common, and context BEPs the least common. The percentage of BEP types varies greatly between individual participants. It is also clear that individual participants often strongly favoured either leaf (RJ and browsing) or non-leaf (container and combination) BEPs. At either extreme, participant 1 chose 56% leaf-level BEPs and 40% higher-level BEPs, while participant 5 chose 23% leaf-level BEPs and 72% higher-level BEPs. Both RJ and context BEPs showed a high variability among participants.

To examine variation between participants more fully, we calculated the proportion of unique BEPs of each type chosen by each participant ( Table 3 ). Overall, participant 3 chose the smallest percentage of BEPs (26%), while participant 7 chose the greatest percentage of BEPs (46%). RJ, browsing and contextual BEPs all show a high degree of variation between participants, while combination BEPs show the least variation, show-ing that all participants could identify a good proportion of cases in which combination BEPs were useful.
Secondly, we examined the number of leaf-level objects accessible from individual BEPs, and averaged these figures across query categories and BEP types ( Table 4 ). Since RJ BEPs consist of a single relevant object, they always support access to exactly one leaf-level object. Overall, averaged across queries, com-bination BEPs supported access to the most relevant objects, followed by context and container BEPs, followed by browsing and RJ BEPs. It is also clear from these results that BEPs have different character-istics in the context of different query categories: factual and content-and-structure queries seem to share similar characteristics, and essay-topic and content-only queries also seem to be similar.

We also averaged across participants ( Table 5 ). Participant 6 did not choose any context BEPs for any of his/her queries. It is clear that there is considerable variation among participants: although it is possible to discern that some pairs of participants share similar profiles, e.g. participants 5 and 8, and participants 9 and 10, there is no obvious common pattern of BEP characteristics across all participants, or even across groups of participants.

Thirdly, we examined the proportion of relevant accessible objects, i.e. the proportion of objects acces-sible from individual BEPs that is composed of relevant objects ( Table 6 ). For RJ BEPs, this figure is 100%, by definition. Among the other BEP types the figure is highest for browsing BEPs (93%), and lowest for context BEPs (53%). This could be expected, since browsing BEPs most often start solid sequences of rel-evant lines, while context BEPs are themselves non-relevant objects, and may be followed by further non-relevant objects before any relevant objects are encountered. Across query categories, the proportions are rather similar. As seen for the total number of accessible leaf-level objects, described earlier in this section, factual and content-and-structure queries exhibit similar behaviour, while essay-topic and content-only queries also display similar characteristics.

We also examined the proportion of relevant accessible objects across participants ( Table 7 ), in order to assess whether participants used BEP types in differing ways. The figures for each participant were calcu-lated by averaging across all queries performed by that participant. Overall, participants identified BEPs that covered a large proportion of relevant objects: participant 10 chose BEPs with the maximum coverage (92% of relevant objects), and participants 1 and 3 chose BEPs with minimum coverage (75% of relevant objects). Context BEPs show the greatest variation among participants, with participant 1 choosing context
BEPs covering only 5% of relevant objects (participant 6 did not identify any context BEPs at all), while participants 10 and 8 chose BEPs covering 89% and 86% of relevant objects, respectively. The least varia-tion was observed for browsing BEPs, with participant 2 choosing BEPs with the maximum coverage (100% of relevant objects), and participant 10 choosing BEPs with minimum coverage (87% of relevant objects).
Finally, we examined the proportion of relevant accessible objects, i.e. the proportion of relevant objects for a given query that is accessible from individual BEPs. This was found to be 100% for all queries: this means that, for each query, at least one participant chose a BEP that covered each of the relevant objects. The analysis across participants and BEP types is shown below ( Table 8 ).

As could be anticipated from the BEP type definitions, the highest proportion of relevant objects is ac-cessed through BEPs from a higher structural level, namely combination BEPs and container BEPs, while the lowest proportion of relevant objects is accessed through RJ BEPs (i.e. single leaf level objects). Ten of the eleven participants chose BEPs that supported access to at least 95% of all relevant objects for their queries. This indicates that most participants thought the choice of relevant objects by other participants quite reasonable, even if it did not match with their own, and were willing to accommodate this in their choice of BEPs. Again, although no overall pattern can be established across all participants, it can be seen that some participants shared a similar strategy, e.g. participants 9 and 10. 2.3. Discussion
Regarding the distribution of BEP types, the most common BEP types identified in the Shakespeare data were browsing and container BEPs. However, the percentage of BEP types varied greatly between individ-ual participants. Individual participants also often appeared to have a preference for either leaf (RJ and browsing) or non-leaf (container and combination) BEPs.

With regards to the number of leaf-level objects accessible from individual BEPs, combination BEPs sup-ported access to the greatest number overall. However, in this particular respect, there was no discernable pattern of BEP characteristics across all participants, or even across groups of participants. In other words, although participants seem to have an intuitive understanding of a BEP as a concept separate and distinct from ROs, there does not appear to be any shared understanding of the nature of different BEP types.
Overall, browsing BEPs provided access to the highest proportion of relevant accessible objects, and con-text BEPs the lowest proportion. Context BEPs also showed the greatest variability between participants in this respect. Combination and container BEPs provided access to the highest proportion of the total num-ber of relevant objects, and RJ BEPs the lowest proportion, as was expected. No common pattern was dis-cernable among participants in this respect.
 The BEP type definitions employed in this analysis were derived from retrospective examination of the
Shakespeare collection, and may therefore have been heavily influenced by the subject domain and struc-ture of the data. Subsequently, in order to examine this issue, a further small-scale study was performed using a sub-set of the INEX 2002 test collection. The findings of this preliminary study, relating in partic-ular to BEP types, are reported and discussed in Section 4.

It is also clear from the above analysis that BEPs have different characteristics in the context of different query categories. This finding supports the conclusions from our previous study that the influence of query category is very strong X  X ee Reid et al. (2005) . Specifically, essay-topic and content-only queries share sim-ilar,  X  X  X ypical X  X  characteristics, while factual and content-and-structure queries exhibit different,  X  X  X typical X  X  behaviour. In fact, this factor seems a much more consistent determinant of participant behaviour than
BEP types. 3. BEP usage
Our final study investigates the usage and effectiveness of BEPs in the context of real information search-ing tasks. It builds on a previous user study, described in Finesilver and Reid (2003) , which examined the usage and effectiveness of BEPs compared to ROs, using only essay-topic, content-only queries from the
Shakespeare study. The study described below uses queries belonging to each of the query categories (includ-ing one of the essay-topic, content-only queries used in Finesilver and Reid (2003) ), and focuses on compar-ing the usage and effectiveness of BEPs for these different categories. The experimental methodology was designed to replicate, as closely as possible, the methodology used in the previous study, so that results could be compared across the two studies where appropriate. The following sections describe the interface used to display the BEPs (Section 3.1), the experimental methodology employed (Section 3.2) and the results and analysis (Section 3.3). Section 3.4 discusses the findings in the context of previous, related work. 3.1. Interface development
In Finesilver and Reid (2003) , an interface was developed in order to compare the usage and effectiveness of BEPs and ROs for two essay-topic, content-only queries ( Fig. 1 ). The interface for this second user study was constructed to replicate this design, so that any differences in results could not be attributed to the use of a different interface. The interface was designed to support both linear (at the same structural level) and hierarchical (moving between structural levels) information searching behaviour in the context of struc-tured documents. The interface is split into two main panes. The left-hand pane displays the structure of the play. Any object that is opened up by the user is displayed in the right-hand pane, e.g. if the user clicks on a speech in the left-hand pane, the contents of that speech are displayed in the right-hand pane. Direct hierarchical information searching behaviour is supported by use of the left-hand structure pane. Linear information searching is supported by use of the previous and next buttons in the top right corner of the interface, or by linear use of the left-hand structure pane (e.g. using the keyboard arrow keys).
Queries were pre-entered and chosen from a pull-down menu at the top of the screen. Software logging was set up, in order to log, for each object selected by the participant, the object ID, the time at which it was selected, its structural level and whether the object was a BEP. A separate log was created for each partic-ipant session. 3.2. Experimental methodology
In this section, we discuss the queries, participants and experimental design. Four queries were chosen from the Shakespeare test collection, one query of each possible query category (i.e. query complexity/query type combination). Since the aim of the experiment was to encourage and examine information searching behaviour, the queries were chosen to be complex and have a high number of BEPs. The queries selected were:
Query 1 :  X  X  X ive an analysis of the  X  merry war  X  and witticism that pass between Beatrice and Benedick. X  X  (Essay-topic/content-only query relating to the play Much Ado About Nothing). This query was also used by Finesilver and Reid (2003) .

Query 2 :  X  X  X hat might be the symbolic implications of the end of the play when Fortinbras is left the ruler of Denmark? X  X  (Essay-topic/content-and-structure query relating to the play Hamlet).

Query 3 :  X  X  X t what point does Macbeth decide to murder King Duncan? X  X  (Factual/content-only query relating to the play Macbeth).

Query 4 :  X  X  X n the beginning of the play A Midsummer Night  X  s Dream, who was in love with whom? How did this change in the end? X  X  (Factual/content-and-structure query relating to the play A Midsummer Night  X  s Dream).
 Table 9 shows a breakdown of the BEPs for these four queries, organised by structural level.
 Eight undergraduate students were recruited from the Department of English and Drama at Queen
Mary University of London. A Masters student was also recruited from the same department to mark the final task outcomes.

The experiment adopted a within-subject design, i.e. each participant performed all four queries. The order of the queries was counterbalanced in order to avoid any possible order effect. At the start of the ses-sion, each participant was given the chance to become familiar with the interface during a 10-min training session, using a different Shakespeare play: during this time, the experimenter answered any questions relat-ing to the interface functionality. The participant was then asked to fill in a background questionnaire, prior to starting on the query tasks. The background questionnaire elicited personal information (e.g. gen-der and year of study) and play-related information (general familiarity with the plays of Shakespeare, and familiarity with the individual plays to which the queries related).

The participant performed each query task in the given order. Performing a task involved: using the information searching interface to find text to answer the query; writing up a brief answer to the query; and completing a task questionnaire, which elicited information such as whether the participant had a prior idea of the answer to the query, how easy they found the query to understand, how difficult they found the query to answer, how useful they found the BEPs, and whether they had enough time to complete the query. There was no time limit, but the length of time taken by each participant was logged, as were the individual actions taken by the participant during each query (i.e. which objects they clicked on).
Finally, the participant was asked to fill in an interface questionnaire, which elicited their opinions about the interface and also gave them the opportunity to provide any other comments. After the experiment, the participants  X  answers were given to the marker, who assigned a score out of 25 to each answer, on the basis of quality and coverage. 3.3. Results and analysis
There are three main sets of results: data from the participant questionnaires, analysis of the BEPs cho-sen by participants during searching, and task performance data in the form of times and scores. Where possible, results were tested for significance using a two-way ANOVA (related) test. This allows us to exam-ine the effect of query complexity, query type, any interaction effect between these two variables, and any participant effect (i.e. unwanted variations between participants). Only those results that relate directly to the issues of the usage and effectiveness of BEPs are described in detail below. 3.3.1. Questionnaire data
The data elicited by the participant questionnaires was divided into three types: background, task-related and interface-related. The background questionnaire elicited personal and play-related information. Four female and four male participants took part in the experiment. All the participants were in the final year of an undergraduate degree in English and Drama. The remaining background information concerns the par-ticipants  X  general familiarity with the works of Shakespeare, and their familiarity with the individual plays used in the experiment (on a scale of 1 X 5, where 1 = very familiar and 5 = not familiar at all).
The average general familiarity of the participants with the works of Shakespeare was 2.125. The figures for familiarity with individual plays are shown in Table 10 . Query complexity was found to be significant at p &lt; 0.05, i.e. participants were significantly more familiar with the plays for which they performed essay-topic queries than with those for which they performed factual queries.

The task-related questionnaire examined whether the participant had a prior idea of the answer to the query ( Table 11 ), how easy they found the query to understand ( Table 12 ), how difficult they found the query to answer ( Table 13 ), and how useful they found the BEPs ( Table 14 ). The significant results were:
More participants had a prior idea of the answer for the content-and-structure queries than for the con-tent-only queries ( p &lt; 0.01).

There was variation among the participants with respect to ease of understanding the query, i.e. some participants found it easier to understand the set of queries, as a whole, than others ( p &lt; 0.05).
There was variation among the participants with respect to usefulness of BEPs, i.e. some participants considered the BEPs, overall, to be more useful than other participants did ( p &lt; 0.025).

The interface-related questionnaire examined whether the participants thought the interface was straightforward, and how easy they found the interface to use. This information was gathered in order to verify that poor interface design had not influenced the results. None of the participants thought the interface was difficult to use or experienced any significant problems in using it. 3.3.2. BEP data
The BEPs examined by participants during searching were logged and analysed by query category and structural level, and the proportion of the total number of BEPs was calculated ( Table 15 ). The significant results are:
Participants examined a greater proportion of BEPs for essay-topic queries than for factual queries ( p &lt; 0.01).

With regard to essay-topic queries, participants examined a greater proportion of BEPs for those queries that were content-only than for those that were content-and-structure (interaction effect, p &lt; 0.025).
With regard to factual queries, participants examined a greater proportion of BEPs for those queries that were content-and-structure than for those that were content-only (interaction effect, p &lt; 0.025). 3.3.3. Task performance data
The time spent by each participant on each query task was recorded ( Table 16 ), and the task outcomes marked out of 25, giving each participant a possible total of 100 ( Table 17 ). The significant results are: Participants scored better on factual queries than essay-topic queries ( p &lt; 0.05).
 Participants scored better on content-only queries than content-and-structure queries ( p &lt; 0.025). 3.3.4. Discussion
Some general conclusions can be drawn from consideration of the results of this user study in conjunc-tion with the findings of Finesilver and Reid (2003) . The results of this study show that the proportion of
BEPs examined is higher for essay-topic queries than for factual queries, despite the fact that participants were more familiar with essay-topic queries than factual queries. Across all four queries, participants exam-ined, on average, 50% of BEPs, but this figure rises to 58% for the essay-topic/content-and-structure query (Hamlet) and 66% for the essay-topic, content-only query (Much Ado). These figures are both higher than the figures of 51% and 46% for the two essay-topic/content-only queries used in the previous study (the lat-ter figure of 46% relates to the same Much Ado query used in this study). Overall, it is clear that users are not likely to examine all the highlighted BEPs for a given query, even if they have unlimited time to do so.
It also appears that the particular properties of factual and content-and-structure queries elicit different information searching behaviour from participants. With regards to essay-topic queries, participants in this study examined significantly more BEPs for those queries that were content-only than for those that were content-and-structure. Taken in conjunction with previous results, we can conclude that this is likely to be due to the restrictive effect of the structural constraint in content-and-structure queries, meaning that par-ticipants already have a good idea of where to look for the answer to the query. With regards to factual queries, on the other hand, participants in this study examined significantly more BEPs for those queries that were content-and-structure than for those that were content-only. Since factual queries can generally be answered by reference to a very small number of texts, the structural constraint in content-and-structure queries may actually increase the number of texts that require consideration.

In this study, participants obtained higher scores for factual queries than for essay-topic queries. This is probably due to the simple fact that factual queries are easier to answer, and that it is usually clear when the  X  X  X orrect X  X  answer has been found. Participants obtained higher scores for content-only queries than for content-and-structure queries, despite the fact that they more often had a prior idea of where to find the an-swer to content-and-structure queries than content-only queries. Since more BEPs were examined for essay-topic/content-only queries than for essay-topic/content-and-structure queries, it may be that BEPs were of particular help to participants in this respect.

Overall, the above results suggest that BEPs may be most useful for queries where there are many rel-evant objects, which are distributed widely throughout the text, i.e. essay-topic, content-only queries. This conclusion is not directly supported by the participants  X  estimations of BEP usefulness in this study. How-ever, it does accord with the findings of the previous study by Finesilver and Reid (2003) , who found that the adoption of an optimal strategy for using BEPs with essay-topic/content-only queries could produce improvement in performance (in terms of participants  X  scores) over usage of relevant objects. 4. BEPS in INEX
In Reid et al. (2005) , we described a related small-scale experimental study using the INEX2002 test col-lection ( Fuhr et al., 2004 ). This further study was carried out with the aim of making some preliminary observations about the concept of BEPs, as interpreted in this paper (i.e. entry points in the articles from which users could obtain optimal access to relevant XML elements).

The participant data from this study was examined to establish if the BEP types identified in the Shake-speare analysis also applied in the context of the INEX 2002 data, and if any further BEP types could be identified ( Table 18 ). This analysis shows that combination and container BEPs were hardly used by the participants. In fact, the majority (55%) of the BEPs chosen by the participants could not be classified under any of the existing BEP types. Two new BEP types identified were:
PartRJ (partial RJ). This was a very common type, accounting for 50% of all BEPs. In such cases, par-ticipants chose a sub-part of a relevance judgement as a BEP. For example, a participant chose as a BEP a particular paragraph from a section that had been judged as an RJ. The preponderance of this BEP type illustrates the shift towards lower level structural components already observed from the increased number of BEPs compared to ROs at structural level 4.
 New. In such cases, there was no discernable relationship between the chosen BEP and the ROs, i.e. the
BEP was related to the ROs neither by hierarchical structure (e.g. container or partRJ BEP) nor by sequential structure (e.g. browsing or context BEP). The BEP was, therefore, marked as  X  X  X ew X  X . All the participants identified a very similar total number of BEPs, and the distribution of these across
BEP types was also similar for all participants ( Table 19 ). However, as demonstrated by the low levels of agreement between participants ( Reid et al., 2005 ), this does not mean that participants chose the same BEPs.

Across all participants, the proportion of unique BEPs chosen was similar for most BEP types, with a slightly higher percentage of browsing BEPs chosen than other BEP types ( Table 20 ). There was least variation between participants in the percentage chosen for browsing and partRJ BEPs (an 8% range), All the participants chose a similar total percentage of unique BEPs, within an 8% range. However, there is little evidence of common patterns of BEP type choice across participants, although it is interesting that the single container BEP was chosen by all participants, and that the two participants with the highest over-all percentages of BEPs chosen identified a considerably lower percentage of context BEPs than the other two participants. 5. Conclusions and future work
This paper has revisited the concept of focussed retrieval, employing BEPs to provide optimal starting-points from which users can browse to find relevant objects. The work described here uses a document col-lection of Shakespeare plays marked up in XML, along with 43 queries, relevance assessments and BEPs gathered during the Shakespeare user study. Some preliminary findings from a small-scale experimental study using the INEX 2002 data have also been presented.

With regards to BEP types, it is difficult to discern any significant patterns in our results. The most com-mon BEP types identified in the Shakespeare data were browsing and container BEPs. However, in the
INEX study, the majority of BEPs could not be classified under any of the five existing BEP types, leading to the creation of two new types. In the Shakespeare data, the percentage of BEP types varied considerably between individual participants, although there was some evidence that participants often had a preference for either leaf or non-leaf BEPs. In the INEX study, on the other hand, the distribution of BEPs across BEP types was similar for most participants, although participants did not agree on which specific BEPs should be chosen. In fact, the concept of BEP type, as currently conceived, appears to be a poor determinant of participant behaviour. Query category is a much more consistent determinant of behaviour in our results.
With regards to BEP usage and effectiveness, it is clear that users are highly unlikely to examine all indi-cated BEPs for a query, even if they have unlimited time to do so. In our experiment, participants exam-ined, on average, only 50% of BEPs, and the maximum percentage of BEPs examined for an individual query was 66%. Again, query category was found to have a strong effect on our results. For essay-topic queries, the presence of a structural constraint appears to reduce the number of BEPs that are examined; for factual queries, on the other hand, the presence of such a constraint appears to increase the number of BEPs that are examined.

Finally, there is some evidence in our participant performance results that BEPs may be most useful for queries where there are many relevant objects, which are distributed widely throughout the text, i.e. essay-topic, content-only queries. This conclusion is not directly supported by the participants  X  estimations of
BEP usefulness in this study, but it does accord with the findings of the previous study by Finesilver and Reid (2003) .

Overall, it is obvious from the findings discussed in this paper and in Reid et al. (2005) that the process of identifying BEPs is not straightforward. There are several factors that affect this process, some of which we have examined during the studies described in this paper, and some of which can be identified from our results. The factors are:
The data used , specifically the subject domain and logical structure of the data . For example, participants in the INEX study often showed a preference for specific components, e.g. the article  X  s abstract, while such a strategy was not possible with the Shakespeare data, where there were no equivalent  X  X  X amed X  X  components. The more detailed and complex structure of the INEX data thus seemed to support par-ticipants in quickly identifying components that might be useful.

The query ( or topic ) category . Analysis of the Shakespeare study data showed that the nature and characteristics of BEPs were very strongly influenced by query category. Essay-topic and content-only queries usually produced consistent results close to average values, while factual queries often exhibited a typical behaviour, and content-and-structure queries exhibited inconsistent behaviour. Although com-parison with the INEX data is not possible, since the INEX study used only one topic, this result was confirmed by the study of BEP usage described in Section 4 of this paper. Indeed, it appears from our results that query category is the primary determinant of BEP-related characteristics and behaviour.
The nature of the relevance assessments . In both the Shakespeare study and the INEX initiative, partic-ipants were provided with the relevance assessments for their given queries/topics, and asked to identify
BEPs. It could therefore be assumed that there would be a strong relationship between the relevance assessments and the BEPs themselves. For example, the Shakespeare study relevance assessments were all at leaf level (subsequent analysis used the concept of extrapolated relevance to examine relevant objects at different structural levels), while the INEX relevance assessments were at any structural level.
Furthermore, the INEX relevance assessment sets often included components at different structural lev-els that contained the same relevant information (i.e. parents of other relevant components). The differ-ing nature of the relevance assessments in these two studies, particularly in terms of the structural level of the relevance assessments, appears to have had a strong effect, both on the relationship between BEPs and relevant objects (e.g. reduction levels) and on the nature of the BEPs themselves (e.g. distribution of BEPs and BEP types across structural levels).

Experimental participants . In all the studies described in this paper, there was considerable variation between participants. While a certain level of variation must be expected in any experiment, there was some limited indication of common patterns and behaviour between small groups of participants in the analysis of the data from the Shakespeare study and subsequent BEP usage study. This finding is supported by Ghuman (2004) , who observed participants  X  behaviour and strategies during the process of choosing BEPs for the given INEX topic. She grouped their strategies into two categories: topic-based strategies, which resulted from examination of the topic statement, and searching strategies, which resulted from examination of the content and structure of the data itself. Certain strategies were adopted by all the participants, e.g. examining keywords (topic-based) and examining relevance assessments (searching), while other strategies were shared by sub-sets of participants, e.g. reading the narrative sec-tion of the topic (topic-based) and reading the first sentence of a paragraph to judge whether it was worth reading the rest of it (searching).
 Future work will focus on four main areas. Firstly, we will conduct a larger-scale examination of the
INEX data as part of a special INEX track. In 2004, INEX started four new tracks, one of which is the interactive track, which is planned to run for at least 2 years. The two principal aims of this track are to investigate the behaviour of users when interacting with components of XML documents, and to investi-gate and develop approaches for XML retrieval that are effective in user-based environments. The former aim is currently being investigated in INEX 2004, where our objective is to identify trends regarding how users access relevant information, without explicitly considering the notion of BEPs. We believe that this exploratory study will give further and new insights into how the browsing and querying paradigms may be combined to provide optimal access to relevant information items, i.e. to focus retrieval to the appro-priate level of granularity. In 2005, we are planning a large-scale investigation, in which we will explicitly investigate the usage of BEPs in the context of the INEX data, based on the findings of the exploratory study from 2004.

Secondly, our results have shown that, although the concept of BEP type is a valid and interesting one, our current categorisation of BEP types does not extend to different document collections. It will therefore be necessary to perform a more rigorous analysis of document collections from different subject domains and with different structural characteristics, in order to develop a more comprehensive and generally appli-cable classification. The modified categorisation must incorporate the concepts of both hierarchical and lin-ear structure in a consistent way.
Thirdly, although our results indicate that BEPs should be most useful for content-only, essay-topic que-ries (since such queries generally have many relevant objects widely distributed throughout the text), this finding is not supported by the opinions of the participants in the BEP usage study. In fact, in that study, participants rated BEPs as most useful for the factual, content-and-structure query, with the essay-topic, content-only query coming second. It is noticeable, however, that all the participants had a prior idea of the answer to the factual, content-and-structure query: it is possible, therefore, that participants were using the BEPs for this query as a navigation device in order to home in on an area of the text that they already knew to be relevant. In contrast, less than half the participants had a prior idea of the answer to the essay-topic, content-only query, and it is therefore likely that, for this query, participants were more heavily depen-dent on BEPs to direct them towards relevant information and support their browsing behaviour. Further controlled studies of BEP usage will, therefore, be necessary in order to examine this issue in more detail.
Finally, the conclusions drawn from these and future, related studies will be used to inform the design of prototype interfaces to a focussed SDR system. A candidate interface, the Relevance LinkBar interface, has already been developed and has undergone an initial evaluation ( Gkaranatsi, 2001; Reid &amp; Dunlop, 2003 ).
This interface, which extends the standard ranked retrieval interface of the Google search engine by pro-viding the user with a visualisation of links within each webpage, has already been shown to provide good support for browsing behaviour. Current work in progress is comparing the relative effectiveness of repre-senting in-links and out-links in the Relevance LinkBar. Future work in this area will therefore focus on implementing BEPs for essay-topic, content-only queries using the RelevanceLinkBar interface. Acknowledgments

 1. Introduction
Document collections often display hierarchical structural characteristics. For example, a report may contain sections and subsections, each of which is composed of paragraphs. Structured document retrieval (SDR) attempts to exploit such structural information by retrieving documents based on combined struc-ture and content information e.g. ( Brin &amp; Page, 1998; Frisse, 1988; Kotsakis, 2002; Myaeng, Jang, Kim, &amp; Zhoo, 1998; Wilkinson, 1994 ).

Structural information can be exploited at several stages of the information retrieval process. Firstly, it can be used at the indexing stage, where document components are identified and indexed as separate, but related, units ( Cleveland, Cleveland, &amp; Wise, 1984; Tenopir &amp; Ro, 1990 ). Secondly, structural information can be used at the retrieval stage by allowing document components of varying granularity to be retrieved, thus cutting down the amount of effort a user spends in pinpointing relevant information e.g. ( Fuhr &amp;
Gro X johann, 2001; Ro  X  lleke, 1999 ). The issue of retrieval granularity has been addressed by many of the approaches developed for retrieval of documents in XML format; see ( Fuhr, Malik, &amp; Lalmas, 2004 ).
Thirdly, such information can be used at the results presentation stage by making structural relationships explicit to the user, thus reducing time and disorientation caused by lack of proximity of related document components in results interfaces, e.g. fisheye views to enable effective browsing of large documents ( Furnas, 1999 ); expand-collapse functionality to support focus on, and movement between, particular structural ele-ments of documents e.g. ( Hertzum &amp; Fr X kj X r, 1996 ); and use of clustering or sub-lists of related objects by web search engines (e.g. Google). Results presentation may also be focussed by presenting only selected document components in the interface, rather than all relevant document components: this approach, known as focused retrieval , is the topic of this paper.

Focussed retrieval acknowledges the importance of users  X  natural browsing behaviour, and combines the browsing and querying paradigms to return best entry points to structured documents. There have been sev-eral interpretations of the broad concept of best entry point (BEP) in different fields. In web retrieval, in particular in the topic distillation task of the TREC web track that is principally devoted to a topic and is not part of a larger site also principally devoted to the topic ( Craswell, Hawking, Wilkinson, &amp; Wu, 2003 ). In INEX, the evaluation initiative for XML retrieval, ument component that is both exhaustive (describing the extent to which an XML element covers or dis-cusses the topic of request) and specific (describing the extent to which an XML element is focused on the topic of request) to the information need could be considered an equivalent concept ( Fuhr et al., 2004 ). A third interpretation, which is the one followed in this work, is that of ( Chiaramella, Mulhem, &amp; Fourel, 1996 ) in the context of hypermedia multimedia retrieval. Here, a BEP is a document component from which the user can obtain optimal access, by browsing, to relevant document components. In all these interpretations, the use of BEPs in place of relevant document components as the basic units of the results list is intended to support the information searching behaviour of users, and enable them to gain more effec-tive and efficient access to relevant information items.

In ( Kazai, Lalmas, &amp; Reid, 2003 ) a test collection for the focussed retrieval of structured documents was constructed. This test collection consisted of a structured document collection, a set of queries adapted to the SDR task, and sets of corresponding relevance assessments and BEPs elicited from experimental par-ticipants. Initial analysis of the participants  X  BEP selection criteria led to the development of BEP retrieval algorithms ( Kazai, Lalmas, &amp; Ro  X  lleke, 2001 ). These algorithms were implemented and empirically evalu-ated ( Kazai, Lalmas, &amp; Ro  X  lleke, 2002 ), but were found to yield poor performance. We then carried out two further small-scale studies in order to explore, in more detail, particular aspects of the issue of auto-matic BEP identification ( Lalmas &amp; Reid, 2003 ). The first study employed algorithms incorporating differ-ent combinations of information related to the individual components themselves, their structural level, and their hierarchically related components, in order to identify BEPs automatically from a ranked results list of document components ( Pithia, 2002 ). The second study employed rules derived from statistical analysis of the experimental data in order to identify BEPs automatically from known relevant document compo-nents ( Srigananathan, 2002 ). Overall, the results of both these studies were poor, but it was concluded that combination of information related to, primarily, the hierarchical relationships between components and, secondarily, structural level, may provide the most promising method of automatic BEP identification.
In summary, the findings from these studies highlighted the need for further investigation of the charac-teristics of BEPs in order to inform the development of more sophisticated algorithms for the automatic identification of BEPs. In this paper, we describe a study that was designed to explore the characteristics of
BEPs, in particular in comparison to relevant components. Results analysis is also performed across differ-ent query categories (factual/essay-topic; content-only/content-and-structure).

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we describe the Shakespeare test col-lection data, upon which our study is based. Sections 3 and 4 examine two specific BEP characteristics: the relationship between BEPs and relevant objects, and agreement between BEPs and relevant objects. In both these analyses, we discuss the effect of three factors: query complexity (factual/essay-topic queries), query type (content-only/content-and-structure queries), and structural level. In Section 5, we report preliminary findings from a further small-scale user study designed to identify and analyse BEPs for the INEX data set ( Kazai, Lalmas, Fuhr, &amp; Go  X  vert, 2004 ). We conclude the paper with a summary of our findings and pro-posals for future work in Section 6. 2. Shakespeare user study data
In this section, we introduce the basic elements of the Shakespeare user study data: the document col-lection, queries, relevance assessments and BEPs. 3 Eleven students from the undergraduate BA in English
Literature and Drama at Queen Mary, University of London participated in the construction of the test collection (i.e. providing queries, relevance assessments and BEP assessments). The experimental method-ology used to acquire the data is fully described in ( Kazai et al., 2003 ). 2.1. Document collection
The document collection consists of 12 Shakespeare plays marked up in XML by Jon Bosak, and avail-able from the web at http://www.ibiblio.org/bosak/ . The 12 plays are Antony and Cleopatra, A Midsummer
Night  X  s Dream, Hamlet, Julius Caesar, King Lear, Macbeth, Much Ado About Nothing, Othello, Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, Troilus and Cressida, and Twelfth Night. Each piece of content enclosed by XML tags is a retrievable element. The maximum depth of nested XML elements is 6. Each play contains, on average, 5 096 elements, 5 acts, 21 scenes, 892 speeches and 3311 lines. 2.2. Queries
The test collection includes 43 queries. Each query relates to a single play in the collection (average 3.58 queries per play), and was produced by an experimental participant as the result of a real information need. The queries are of varying complexity:
Factual. Generally, a small number of short, simple elements provide the answer to such queries. An example query is  X  X  X ow old is Juliet? X  X . There is a maximum of one factual query per play.

Essay -topic. Generally, reference will have to be made to many, complex elements to find the answer to such queries. An example query is  X  X  X escribe the character of Lady Macbeth X  X .

The queries also reflect the additional functionality of structured query languages (e.g. Xpath, i.e. that it is possible to query by structure. Each query, therefore, belongs to one of two types:
Content -only. This is the standard type of query in information retrieval: such queries describe a topic of interest to the user.

Content -and -structure. This type of query combines topic and structural requirements. An example of such a query is  X  X  X etrieve the title and first speech of scenes where the portrayal of the Trojans is com-pared with that of the Greeks X  X .

The distribution of queries across query categories is shown in Table 1 . 2.3. Relevance assessments
In the Shakespeare study, the relevance assessments are binary, and indicate which elements the exper-imental participants considered they would consult (read or reference) in order to answer the given query.
All relevance assessments were made at the lowest structural level, referred to as leaf level elements. This structural level corresponds mostly to the Line level of the collection structure. Participants were asked to highlight the lines that they considered as relevant to their information need, as expressed in the corre-sponding queries. This was considered a feasible approach, since the test collection is reasonably small.
Each query was judged by 2 X 4 participants (average 2.72 judges per query), resulting in 117 relevance assessment sets, containing a total of 6296 leaf level XML elements, for the 43 queries (average 53.81 rele-vant leaf level elements per set and 146.42 relevant leaf level elements per query). When these multiple sets of relevance assessments are pooled for each query, and duplicate elements removed, this gives a total of 4894 unique leaf level XML elements in 43 query sets (average 113.81 elements per query). Since there is only one relevant play for each query, and given that a play contains, on average, 5096 elements, the rele-vant elements for a given query represent 2.23% of the play. 2.4. Best entry points (BEPs)
In our work, BEPs are document components from which the user can obtain optimal access, by brows-ing, to relevant document components. In this case, participants were asked to identify as BEPs those ele-ments that they would prefer to be retrieved in response to the given query. This was done through the use of an interface, which allowed participants to view the relevant document components and navigate through the collection. It should be noted that BEPs can belong to any structural level, and are not always elements that have been judged relevant, but are, in some cases, non-relevant container or contained elements.

The participants identified a total of 928 BEPs for the 43 queries, in 117 sets (average 7.93 BEPs per set and 21.58 BEPs per query). This number is reduced to 552 by removal of duplicate elements (average 12.84
BEPs per query). The BEPs for each query, as judged by each participant, can then be merged to form the final set of BEPs; usually only elements judged as BEPs by the majority of the participants would be included. This is to avoid the problem of multiple BEPs representing the same cluster of relevant elements, e.g. two individual participants choosing two different lines of the same speech as BEPs. The total number of BEPs in this reduced set is 521 (average 12.12 BEPs per query).
 3. Relationship between BEPs and relevant objects (ROs)
As stated in Section 2.4, BEPs can belong to any structural level, while relevance assessments are all leaf-level. In Table 2 , we show the distribution of BEPs across structural levels. For this analysis, the (non-merged) set of unique BEPs (552 BEPs in total) was used, and Line and StageDir objects were collapsed into the leaf object type. The raw values and percentages for each category were calculated by averaging across all queries belonging to that category. It should be noted that there are no BEPs at act level, and only one at play level.

The total number of BEPs for each query category differs considerably, with essay-type and content-only queries having more BEPs than factual and content-and-structure queries. However, the relative distribu-tion of the BEPs is rather similar across query types and complexities. Overall, the majority of the BEPs were selected from the leaf or speech levels, together accounting for 93% of all BEPs. This suggests that participants generally show a preference for smaller contexts. Examining the effect of query complexity, fac-tual queries have more BEPs at leaf level and fewer at speech and scene levels. Examining the effect of query type, content-and-structure queries have more BEPs at speech level and less at leaf level.

Table 3 shows the distribution of ROs across the two main leaf levels (Line and StageDir) and for other types of objects (Other), e.g. Persona. The majority of ROs for all query categories are of Line type, as would be expected. Most of the query categories also have a similar total number of ROs per query, with the exception of factual queries, which have fewer. Examining the effect of query complexity, factual queries show a comparatively high percentage of Other objects; however, this result was heavily influenced by one individual query (query 34, relating to Macbeth:  X  X  X ho does the ghost appear to and does he/she/they ever see the ghost again?). This query could only be answered by reference to Speaker objects (part of the Other object type). Examining the effect of query type, content-and-structure queries show a very high percentage of Line objects.

The above results for BEPs and ROs can be explained by the particular properties of factual and content-and-structure queries. Factual queries involve a question X  X nswering process, rather than an evidence-gathering one. The  X  X  X nswer X  X  to factual queries is, therefore, likely to be contained in fewer, lower-level contexts, thus explaining the lower total number of ROs, and the higher proportion of ROs at leaf level rather than speech level. Content-and-structure queries make explicit reference to a structural requirement, which imposes an additional constraint on the selection process, i.e. that ROs must appear at a particular structural level, often the speech level in this collection. This indicates that there will be a lower number of candidate BEPs and ROs, and a higher proportion of BEPs at speech level rather than leaf level.
In addition, 6 of the 8 content-and-structure queries were also essay-topic queries (evidence-gathering, rather than fact-finding), so, again, are more likely to involve ROs at a structural level above leaf level.
WecanobserveaninterestingpatternintheidentificationofBEPs from ROs. BEPs tendedtobechosenat the same structural level as the corresponding ROs, or one level above in the hierarchy. Participants often specifiedasequenceofconsecutivelinesasbeingrelevant,andthenchosethefirstlineofthissequenceasbeing the BEP: this was the case in 87% of such linear chains. In other cases, the level above was generally chosen as the BEP level, most often involving a straightforward move from sub-speech sequence to entire speech.
In the Shakespeare study, this result may have been influenced by the fact that experimental participants were instructed to specify ROs at leaf level. However, these results can also be compared with data on the relationship of relevant items to preferred entry points gathered during the Tess study ( Hertzum &amp; Fr X kj X r, 1996; Hertzum, Lalmas, &amp; Fr X kjaer, 2001 ). In the Tess study, 83 participants solved a number of informa-tion retrieval tasks in relation to the development of graphical user interfaces in the X Window System, a domain very different from Shakespeare  X  s plays. The documentation necessary to solve the tasks was three manuals comprising 774 pages of text. In 51% of tasks, the Tess participants identified the answer to a task by searching and, therefore, preferred an entry point into the documentation that was equal to a relevant item. However, in as much as 21% of the tasks the participants chose to enter the documentation at a higher level in the text hierarchy than the text containing the answer. the participants was at a structural level above the relevant items, which were then identified by reading rather than searching. Access to the documentation was most frequently at the 2nd and 3rd levels (subchap-ters and sub subchapters), which is an average level slightly above that of the ROs.

The results from these two studies agree, therefore, that participants generally display a preference for low-level contexts, and usually at the same level as that of the ROs, or the level immediately above. This implies that BEPs should not simply correspond to the elements containing the answers to the tasks, but rather must strike an appropriate balance between searching and reading.

Finally, we analysed the relationship of BEPs to ROs. Table 4 shows average figures for ROs and BEPs for all query categories, and the degree of reduction for each category. The reduction for an individual query is calculated as (1 X  X umber of BEPs/number of ROs), and the reduction for a query category is cal-culated as the average of the reduction values for all queries belonging to that category.

The number of BEPs is, for all query categories, less than the number of ROs. The reduction is generally large, with 30 of the 43 queries having a reduction of more than 80%. The reduction values are similar across all query categories, apart from factual queries, which show a considerably lower reduction percent-age. This could be expected, since factual queries generally have fewer ROs (79.45 for factual queries com-pared with 113.81 across all categories), often in the form of individual lines well distributed throughout the text; the reduction process is thus likely to eliminate fewer objects.

Analysis was then performed on the reduction process at different structural levels. Although ROs were all leaf level (mostly Line objects; see Table 3 ), extrapolated ROs were created by assuming relevance at the structural level above that of the original RO ( Table 5 ). An optimistic relevance extrapolation strategy was used ( Ro  X  lleke, Lalmas, Kazai, Ruthven, &amp; Quicker, 2002 ); for example, if one line was marked as relevant, relevance was extrapolated to the (complete) speech containing that line, and so on. belong to any structural level, no extrapolation was performed for them. Table 6 shows the reduction levels from (leaf and extrapolated) ROs to BEPs across structural levels.
The small number of ROs at speech level is caused by a high number of leaf level ROs occurring in the same container object (speech) as other leaf level ROs for the same query. For example, if one participant chooses the first line of an individual speech as an RO, and another participant chooses the second and third lines of the same speech, all these would be extrapolated to the same RO at speech level.
The reduction can be seen to be high across all query categories and structural levels. In fact, there was only one instance (query 2 at scene level) where the reduction was negative, i.e. there were more BEPs than
ROs. This was due to a large number of relevant speeches occurring in the same scenes, leading to the choice of container scenes as BEPs, rather than the individual speeches. It is noticeable that the reduction is smaller for factual queries at leaf level; this could be expected, due to the smaller number of ROs for this category, and the high proportion of single-line objects considered relevant. We can see from these results that the choice of BEPs is not simply a function of the relevance of the contained objects: this analysis indi-cates a more complex view of relevance in the context of structured documents. 4. Agreement for BEPs and ROs
The second factor that we investigated in this study is agreement between participants in their choice of both BEPs and (leaf and extrapolated) ROs. Agreement was calculated for each query in terms of overlap, i.e. the size of the intersection of the BEP (or RO) sets for that query divided by the size of the union of the
BEP (or corresponding RO) sets for that query ( Vorhees, 1998 ). Unanimous agreement values were also calculated, i.e. where a BEP (or RO) must be judged relevant by all judges to be included in the intersection.
The agreement for a query category was calculated as the average of the agreement levels for all queries belonging to that category. Results for BEP agreement can be found in Tables 7(general) and 8(unani-mous) , and for RO agreement in Tables 9(general) and 10(unanimous) . In this analysis, leaf level includes all Line, Stagedir and Other objects. BEP agreement was also calculated across all BEPs (this was not done for ROs, since all assessments were made at leaf level, and relevance simply extrapolated to other levels).
BEP agreement (both general and unanimous) generally increases from leaf to speech level and then falls off at higher structural levels. The exception to this pattern is factual queries, which show a higher level of agreement at leaf level than speech level, before rising again at scene level.

RO agreement (both general and unanimous) increases consistently with structural level. This implies that participants may not always agree on the exact context of the RO, but tend to agree more on the gen-eral area in which the ROs can be found. The results show that query type and complexity do not have a strong effect on RO agreement, although factual queries show a slight increase in RO agreement at most structural levels. Unanimous agreement is higher for factual and content-and-structure queries, especially at lower structural levels. This result may be due, again, to the additional constraints these query categories impose, which leave less freedom for individual interpretation.
 Comparing BEP and RO agreement, BEP agreement is better for all categories at leaf and speech level.
For other levels, the opposite trend can generally be observed. This result may, however, be heavily influ-enced by the reduced number of BEPs at these higher levels. Another, related reason for the result may be the optimistic method of relevance extrapolation used to calculate RO agreement. This implies that there will be more ROs at higher structural levels, and the number of BEPs at higher structural levels may thus appear artificially low in comparison.

It should be noted that such work relies heavily on the quality of the data obtained from the experimen-tal participants. In the Shakespeare user study, participants were aided in their selection of BEPs by the use of a user interface, which explicitly showed both the structure and content of the plays, and clearly high-lighted the elements that had been marked relevant by at least one participant ( Kazai et al., 2003 ). Despite this, and the comparatively high level of resulting BEP agreement ( Tables 7 and 8 ), there is still considerable variation between individual participants in terms of the proportion of (unique, non-merged) BEPs they selected for the queries they performed ( Table 11 ). Although the average percentage (across all participants) is similar, especially at the lower structural levels, there is considerable variation among participants in terms of the overall percentage of BEPs chosen and bias towards structural level. 5. BEPS in INEX
INEX, the INitiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval ( Kazai et al., 2004 ) provides an infrastructure (in the form of a large XML test collection) and methodology (e.g. appropriate scoring methods) for the evaluation of content-oriented retrieval of XML documents. The test collection contains a document col-lection, together with sets of topics and corresponding relevance assessments produced by the organisations participating in the initiative.

The INEX document collection is composed of full-text articles marked up in XML: the collection cur-rently includes 12107 articles of varying length from the IEEE Computer Society  X  s publications (12 mag-azines and 6 transactions), covering the period 1995 X 2002. An article contains, on average, 1532 XML elements, and the average depth of nested XML elements is 6.9. Typically, the overall structure of an article consists of a front matter, a body and a back matter. The front matter contains the article  X  s metadata, e.g. title, author, publication information, and abstract. The body is structured in sections, sub-sections, and sub-sub-sections. These logical units start with a title, and contain a number of paragraphs, tables, figures, item lists, in-text references (citations), etc. The back matter includes a bibliography and further informa-tion about the article  X  s authors.

Based on the subject domain of this document collection, each participating organisation created a set of candidate content-only and content-and-structure topics: these topics were designed to reflect the informa-tion needs of real users and the type of service that an operational system might provide. The topic format and development procedure were based on TREC guidelines, which were modified to allow for the specification of structural conditions (e.g. what type of components to return to the user) in content-and-structure queries.

In INEX 2002, a final set of 60 topics (composed of 30 content-only and 30 content-and-structure) was selected from the set of candidate topics, and distributed to the participating organisations. For each topic, participants generated queries from any part of the topic structure, except the narrative, and used these to retrieve ranked lists of XML elements from the document collection. The participants  X  submissions were then merged to form the pool of elements for assessment. During the assessment process, each topic and its pool of elements were assigned to a participating organisation. Where possible, the topic author was asked to perform the assessment; remaining topics were assigned, on a voluntary basis, to a participating organisation with expertise in the relevant subject area.

The assessment process was performed using two dimensions: a four-point scale of topical relevance, which describes the extent to which the information contained in a document component is relevant to the topic, and a four-category grouping for component coverage, which describes how much of the docu-ment component is relevant to the topic. 8 All ascendant components (parents and upwards) and descendant components (children and downwards) were also judged until irrelevant components and/or components with no coverage were encountered. Thus, the set of relevance assessments for an INEX 2002 topic includes all document components that have been judged not to be irrelevant (on the topical relevance dimension) and not to have no coverage (on the document coverage dimension). Assessments were recorded using an on-line assessment system, which allowed users to view the pooled result set of a given topic (listed in alpha-betical order), browse the document collection, and view articles and result elements both in XML format (i.e. showing the tags) and document format (i.e. formatted for ease of reading). Other features of the on-line system included keyword highlighting and consistency checking of the assessments. Assessments were provided for 54 of the 60 topics, covering a total of 48849 articles.

The organisations participating in INEX 2002 were not asked to identify BEPs. However, Ghuman (2004) subsequently carried out a small-scale experimental study using the INEX 2002 test collection, with the aim of making some preliminary observations about the concept of BEPs, as interpreted in this paper (i.e. entry points in the articles from which users could obtain optimal access to relevant XML elements).
This study involved four undergraduate Computer Science students from Queen Mary, University of Lon-don, who were asked to identify BEPs for a single content-only topic, namely topic 47 ( Fig. 1 ). Topic 47 was chosen because it had a manageable number of relevance assessments (relevant objects or ROs) for the size of the study, which was carried out as part of a final year undergraduate student project. Further analysis, focussing on issues also examined in the context of the Shakespeare data, was then carried out. Although it is clearly not possible to generalise from these limited results, the analysis does highlight interesting areas for future exploration.

The examination of BEP characteristics and agreement was carried out according to structural level, where the level reflects the position of the given document component in the hierarchy of the article in which it appears, as defined by the INEX collection DTD. As described above, an article is generally divided into front matter (e.g. keywords, abstract), body (consisting of sections, sub-sections, paragraphs, etc) and back matter (e.g. bibliography). Thus, for example, a complete article would correspond to level 1, the body of that article to level 2, an individual section within the body to level 3, a paragraph of that sec-tion to level 4, and a sentence within that paragraph to level 5. None of the ROs or BEPs for the chosen topic were at a level lower than 5 in the XML structure.

The most common level for both ROs and BEPs ( Table 12 ) is level 3, which mostly corresponds to sec-tions within articles. There are more ROs than BEPs overall and at each individual level except at level 4, which mostly corresponds to sections within articles. Reduction is comparatively high at higher structural levels and falls considerably at lower structural levels.

Both general and unanimous agreement ( Table 13 ) are low. General agreement is highest at level 3, which mostly corresponds to sections of articles, and lowest at levels 2 (front matter, body, back matter) and 5 (e.g. sentence). Unanimous agreement is extremely low at all levels. Analysis of the BEPs selected by individual participants suggests that some participants had a preference for components at a particular structural level ( Table 14 ). Furthermore, examination of participant logs shows that some participants actually had a preference for particular document components at the same level, e.g. abstract, introduction, conclusions. These findings may partly explain the low level of agreement between participants. The small-scale nature of the study may also have contributed to this result. 6. Conclusions and future work
This paper has introduced the concept of focussed retrieval, employing BEPs to provide optimal start-ing-points from which users can browse to find relevant objects. The work described here uses a document collection of Shakespeare plays marked up in XML, along with 43 queries, relevance assessments and BEPs gathered during the Shakespeare user study. Some preliminary findings from a small-scale experimental study using the INEX 2002 data have also been presented.

With regards to the general nature of BEPs, our results show that the concept of BEP is intuitive, as shown by the higher levels of agreement for BEPs than for ROs in the Shakespeare data, and the high reduction levels from ROs to BEPs across all query categories and structural levels. This conclusion is sup-ported by the findings from the INEX data, which show medium to high reduction levels across almost all structural levels. It is also clear from our results that BEPs have a distinct character, as shown by the com-parison between BEPs and (leaf and extrapolated) ROs. The nature of BEPs cannot simply be explained by extrapolated relevance; it is clear that additional factors are introduced by the structural nature of the doc-uments and queries.

With regard to structural level of BEPs, the findings of the Shakespeare study, supported by the results from the further INEX study, indicate that BEPs are usually chosen at the same structural level as, or the level immediately above, the ROs. However, there were some indications in the INEX study that more spe-cific BEPs (i.e. BEPs at a lower structural level) were sometimes chosen instead. This result may be partially due to the characteristics of the INEX relevance assessment sets. Since relevance assessors also judged ascendant components (parents) and descendant components (children) of the original relevant compo-nents, the resulting set of relevance assessments could contain several components, at different structural levels, that contained the same relevant information. For example, if a paragraph was judged to be relevant, the ascendant components (section, body, article) may also appear in the relevance assessment set for that topic. It was observed in ( Ghuman, 2004 ) that, in such cases, participants very often chose a component at a lower structural level as a BEP. This is reflected in the corresponding BEP type analysis, where a high proportion (50%) of partRJ BEPs were identified.

With regard to agreement, BEP agreement was highest at lower structural levels in the Shake-speare study. This result was not reflected in the preliminary findings from the INEX study, where agree-ment was found to be highest at the middle structural level, and inconsistent at the remaining levels. This seemed to be partially due to the personal preferences of the participants involved in the study, who regularly chose components of the same type (e.g. abstract, introduction, conclusions), which belonged to this middle structural level. It is thus not clear if this result would extend to future studies using the INEX data.

By examining the effect of query category, we can see that essay-topic and content-only queries usually produce consistent results close to average values, both with regards to BEPs and their relationship with
ROs, and agreement between participants. This is as expected, since these types of queries most closely approximate the standard,  X  X  X opical X  X  type of query used in information retrieval experiments. Factual que-ries, on the other hand, exhibit atypical behaviour, and content-and-structure queries exhibit inconsistent behaviour for many of the factors we examined.

In order to explore the practical application of our findings from this study, we developed a set of simple heuristics that could be used to identify BEPs from ROs. These heuristics were applied to the relevance assessments from the Shakespeare study, using different thresholds, in order to derive BEPs automatically ( Lalmas &amp; Reid, 2003 ); the derived BEPs were then compared with the BEPs obtained from the experimen-tal participants during the study. Examples of the heuristics are:
If the proportion of relevant lines in a container speech exceeds a given percentage threshold, the speech should be selected as a BEP.

If relevant lines are evenly distributed throughout the container speech (determined by using a distribu-tion formula and applying a threshold), the speech should be selected as a BEP.

If the number of consecutive relevant lines exceeds a given threshold, the first line of the sequence should be selected as a BEP.

If the number of consecutive non-relevant lines exceeds a given threshold, the first line after the non-relevant sequence should be selected as a BEP.

Analysis of the results of this experiment suggests that such simple rules are not sufficient, singly at least, to explain the identification of BEPs from ROs. The process of encoding human criteria for BEP selection is clearly very complex, and the different characteristics of individual query categories appear to provide a further complicating factor.
 In parallel, ( Finesilver &amp; Reid, 2003 ) examined and compared the usage and effectiveness of BEPs and
ROs for a single query category, namely essay-topic, content-only queries. One of the main findings of this study was that different queries belonging to the same query category elicited different information search-ing behaviour. Where an optimal strategy was employed, participants achieved better task performance using BEPs than ROs. From observation of the experiment and examination of the software logs, it appeared that failure to adopt an optimal strategy could be at least partially attributed to the inconsistent nature of the BEPs. Two different BEP types were identified: browsing BEPs (defined as  X  X  X he first object in a sequence of relevant objects X  X ) and container BEPs (defined as  X  X (real or virtual) objects which contained several relevant objects X  X ).

Taken together, the findings from all these studies suggest that further work is required to shed more light on the complex nature of BEPs and the process of deriving them from ROs. This work will focus on two main themes: (1) a more detailed examination of the Shakespeare data, in particular exploring the concept of BEP types; and (2) an empirical study of the usage and effectiveness of BEPs. This work is the focus of ( Reid, Lalmas, Finesilver, &amp; Hertzum, 2005 ). Acknowledgement
