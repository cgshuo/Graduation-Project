 Massive amounts of data are be ing generated on social media sites, such as Twitter and Facebook. This data can be used to better understand people, such as their personality traits, perceptions, and preferences, and predict their behavior. This deeper understanding of users and their behaviors can benefit a wide range of intelligent applicati ons, such as advertising, social recommender systems, and pers onalized knowledge management. These applications will also benefit individual users themselves by optimizing their experiences ac ross a wide variety of domains, such as retail, healthcare, and education. Since mining and understanding user behavior from social media often requires interdisciplinary effort, including machine learning, text mining, human-computer interaction, and social science, our workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from multiple fields to discuss the creation of deeper models of individual users by mining the content that they publish and the social networking behavior that they exhibit.

People from all walks of life are usi ng social media sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, to share data about social events, express opinions, discuss their interests, publicize businesses, recommend products, and, explicitly or implicitly, reveal personal information. Many research pr ojects and commercial products have used this information to drive a variety of services, such as recommending local news stories [2], detecting and summarizing events [3], determining group sentiment of products and brands [1], and smart crowd-sourcing [8]. The majority of this work, however, has focused on aggregating data across many users. In contrast, our focus is to create deep models of individual users from social media, including the content users publish and the behavior that they exhibit. This ha s been an active area of research recently and a number of papers on this topic have appeared in related conferences and workshops [4, 5, 6]. Various analytic techniques have been applied to infer users X  home location [7], orientation [4, 5], and personality [9]. Although there is abundant work in this area, there are many technical challenges remaining to be addressed. Our workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners who are interested in this topic to share their experiences and discu ss remaining challenges. While acquiring a deep understanding of users brings great benefits to businesses and individual users themselves, such an understanding may also reveal information that users would prefer to keep private. Such concerns are particularly impor tant because individuals do not have complete control over the information they share about themselves; friends of a user ma y inadvertently divulge private information about that user in their own posts. This workshop builds upon the success of our previously held workshop in conjunction with ACM IUI 2012 and focuses more on data-centric analysis and mi ning aspects of user and user behavior understanding fro m social media. In particular, we plan to solicit work on topics in one or more of the following areas: Analytics  X  Interactive visual analytics for understanding derived user  X  Integrated content and social network mining and analysis to  X  Mining of heterogeneous data s ources to derive user insights  X  Discovery of trustworthy information and information  X  Identification of significant user attributes (e.g., personality  X  Predictive analytics of user behavior  X  User behavior modeling and mi ning at scale using Big Data Feasibility/challenges of unders tanding individual users from social media  X  What aspects of an individual can be modeled from their  X  What aspects cannot be modeled?  X  What aspects should not be modeled?  X  How accur ate are the models that can be extracted?  X  What are the best techniques to model user behavior?  X  How might the creation of such models be thwarted?

We will hold a full-day workshop program on the first day of CIKM 2012. The program begins with a madness session during which participants introduce them selves and their work in 5 minutes. Participants will be encouraged to make slides for the madness session, but this will not be required. Each paper session will conclude with a discussion led by a pre-chosen workshop participant. These discussions will tie together common themes of the presentations and hopefully lead to insightful discussions about further research directio ns. The program will end with a panel discussion where panelists will discuss the current state of the art, focus areas, and opportunities for future research.
