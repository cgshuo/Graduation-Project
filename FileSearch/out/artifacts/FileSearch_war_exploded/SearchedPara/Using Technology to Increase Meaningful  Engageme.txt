 have benefits), activity interv entions may address loneliness, sensory deprivation, and boredom, which are often at the root of problematic behaviors [3]. Pe ople with dementia experience benefits such as greater well being during activities [4], reduced agitation [5], and delayed progression of cognitive impairments [6]. Despite the benefits, people living in MCUs may not have opportunities for sustained social interactions and stimulating activities [7]. There is a clear unmet need for stimulating activities that don X  X  place an additional burdens on staff, the MCU or the healthcare system. ICT has the potential to support cost-effective activities in a way that reduces staff burden. Mars hall described nine uses of technology for people with deme ntia, including compensation, stimulation and relaxation [8]. Topo added communication to this list [9]. Many projects explored ICT interventions for people with dementia for single purposes, such as communication [10] and musical stimulation [11]. Single-purpose ICT interventions ma y be problematic for several reasons, including cost, setup tim e, technical expertise, and learning time. Additionally, space may be quite limited in MCUs. Multi-functional systems can alleviate some of these issues. I conducted a systematic literature review of multi-functional technology tools designed for or used with people with dementia on five databases including Co mpendex and Inspec. I found 14 systems which met the criteria of containing at least one application in at least two areas: cognitive, psychosocial, sensory, and movement (these categories are from [12]). The retrieved related work was limited in that systems were often designed and used only with people with mild dementia, were not commercially available or accessible to the ge neral population, and were quite limited in terms of the number and range of applications supported. Later I describe the t echnology system that I used for my study, which addresses each of these issues. My research questions are the following: wheeled from room to room and has a webcam, microphone, and speakers. It also comes with a video camera, bike pedal, joystick, and headset. The touch-screen monitor can be plugged into an external monitor. The height can be adjusted to be used by people seated or standing. Residents of a local MCU were enrolled for six months with a family member whenever possible. Five residents, four family members, and seven st aff were enrolled in the study. I conducted weekly sessions with the reside nts, taking handwritten notes, and administered standardized instruments on measures such as quality of life and resource utilization at three time-points. I interviewed staff monthly and family members at three time points. Residents of the facility in which the MCU from the previous study was located were enrolled for three months in this second study. The memory care group is a service provided by the facility for people showing signs of memory impairment but deemed able to engage in stimulating group activities. Three residents and two sta ff members were involved in this study. I observed the use of the system twice a week for two hours and took notes, including rating factors such as whether residents interacted with staff, each other and the system. I also interviewed staff monthly, and interviewed and administered standardized instruments to resident s at baseline and exit. I will generate recommendations fo r designers of activity systems for people with dementia using a secondary analysis of the data from parts one and two and validate them with a panel of experts, including experts from HCI and gerontology. Based on preliminary analysis, findings include that staff and family members found benefit in using the system such as providing residents with something to do, giving residents a sense of accomplishment, and enabling c onversations about new topics. Different applications were found appropriate for group use versus individual use, and indi vidual use was seen as more beneficial but also less likely to occur due to time and staff shortages. People with dementia were able to use and benefit from the system with the assistance of a member of the research team or staff, but not independently. Next steps include a systematic analysis of the data through open coding and the generation of recommendations. This work has several areas of potential contribution towards the fields of HCI and CSCW, including understanding and exploring:  X  The impact of the introduction and utilization of technology  X  How organizational factors, such as different group sharing a  X  How the system impacts staff workflow and roles in the care of people with dementia.
