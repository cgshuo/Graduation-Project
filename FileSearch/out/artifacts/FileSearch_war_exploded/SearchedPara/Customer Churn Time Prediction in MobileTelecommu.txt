 Customer churn is a significant problem in many firms operating on contractual or subscription business setting, like tel ecommunication operators, Internet ser-vice providers, and cable services operators. In a study focusing on the role of satisfaction to model customer length of stay with the telecom service provider, Bolton [5], finds that customer satisfaction is positively correlated with their tenure. First, the tenure is longer for customers who have high levels of cumu-lative satisfaction, and second, the effect of perceived losses (for e.g., transac-tion failures, bad service quality) on the tenure is negative. New customers are particularly vulnerable and if their experiences are not satisfactory, the relation-ship is likely to be short. Customers who a re satisfied with the service provider tend to stay for longer durations. Ordinal regression (OR) is a type of learning when the response variable comes from a finite ordered (i.e., ordinal )set.Sim-ilar to modeling customer satisfaction (which is not observable!) on a ordinal scale, we can model customer tenure as an ordinal response variable to predict customer tenure. In section 2 we explai n the use of classical tenure modeling approach -survival analysis. In section 3 we explain ordinal regression for mod-eling customer churn times. In section 4 we discuss our empirical results on a real world mobile telecom dataset. In section 5 we conclude our work. Traditionally, tenure modeling or length of stay modeling belongs to a branch of statistics called Survival Analysis . Survival analysis (SA) is concerned with analyzing the time to occurrence of an event (e.g., time to churn) in the presence of censored observations [2]. In SA, we be gin observing a set of customers at some well-defined point of time (called the origin time ) and then follow them for some substantial period of time, recording t he times at which customer churn occurs. Some customers may churn after the end of study period, i.e., after censoring time . Such cases are called right censored obs ervations [3]. Several parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric survival regression techniques are available as commercial products and is already part of the telecommunication CRM process. Allison [2], gives a good insight into the use of survival analysis for modeling time-to-event data using a commercial statistical package SAS R [4].
In SA, survival function and hazard rate functions are used to describe the status of customer survival during the tenure of observation. The survival time T is considered as a random variable. The survival function S ( t ) gives the probabil-c.d.fofsurvivaltime T . The hazard function h ( t ) is defined as the conditional likelihood that a customer will churn at time t , given that churn did not occur in we can compute survival and hazard probabilities for a customer x i at each time point t k in the study. By sorting all customers in ascending survival probabilities, at a specified time t k , the customers with lowest predicted survival probabilities will have highest likelihood to churn at that time [3]. In OR, we arrange customer tenure on a ordinal scale such that t 1  X  t 2  X  ... t k  X  ...  X  t support vector machines by determining M  X  1 thresholds (parallel discriminant hyperplanes) for M ranks by dividing the real line into M consecutive intervals, one for each rank. Alternatively, Frank &amp; Hall [7] decompose the original OR problem into a set of binary classification problems. For a review of other OR formulations see [6]. We have implemented the OR formulation proposed in [7] for the results in this paper. The original M -class OR problem with ranks { t using the ordering of the original ranks. Training starts by deriving new datasets from the original dataset, one for each of the M  X  1 new binary classes. Each derived dataset contains the same number of samples as the original, with the same attribute values for each sample, except the class value. In the next step, each of the M  X  1 classifiers will generate a model for each of the new datasets. For each sample (customer) we estimate the probability that it belongs to a target class (i.e., churn probability at that time) as follows: Pr ( t = t 1 )=1  X  Pr ( t = t  X  t = t k =2 , 3 ,...,M  X  1, and Pr ( t = t M )= Pr ( t&gt;t M  X  1 ). To predict the churn time of a customer with unknown churn time, the sample is processed by each of the M  X  1 classifiers and the class with maximum probability is assigned to that customer.

In our experiments, we first start by grouping tenures into ranks such that ( t that this grouping into ranks could come from domain experts, like for example, finding a set of customers who are likely to churn in 6-12 months period or finding set of customers who are likely to stay for more than one year or two years. In the next step, we repeat OR experiments on each rank, with a preference level attached between each atomic time unit (that is, at month level). This hierarchical way is taken to overcome the problem of large number of classes present in the current problem. We demonstrate results on the Churn Modeling Tournament data obtained from The Center for Customer Relationship Management at Duke University [1]. The data were provided by a major wireless telecommunications company using its own customer records. We used calibration dataset which consists of 100 , 000 customers for whom there were 169 independent variables, a unique identifier for each customer and the churn label (0 for churn and 1 for no-churn). 4.1 Data Preparation The churn modeling tournament data ca nnot be directly used for tenure mod-eling experiments. We need to represent the data in a manner suitable for our experiments. X = { x i : i =1 , 2 ,...,N } denote customers, a ij denotes j th feature value for i th customer. In churn modeling data, number of months in service is one of the feature and churn is the output label. Customers who are active at the time of sampling are treated as censored observations and churners are considered as complete observations. Months in service becomes the output variable. Only right-censoring is considered in the present study. Since all cus-tomers in our dataset are at least 7 months old on the network, this becomes the origin time for our experiments. We choose a study period window of 25 months. Therefore the censoring time will be at 31 st month. Hence, customers with tenure 7  X  t&lt; 32 are considered to be complete observations. Customers whose tenure t  X  32 months are considered to be censored observations (right censoring). We bin tenure into five ranks such that A  X  B  X  C  X  D  X  E. Customers who churned in time periods (in months) [7 , 11], [12 , 15], [16 , 21], [22 , 31], and [32 ,  X  ) are assigned ranks A, B, C, D, and E respectively. Note that censored observations are assigned to last rank.
 4.2 Data Preprocessing All attributes which had more than 30% of missing values and those that are summation of two or more variables are also removed. Information gain and chi-squared statistic tests [3] are then used for feature selection. Both methods generate ranking for features. We conduct experiments with top 30, 40, 50 and 99 ranked features. Model with 40 top ran ked features selected from information gain criterion seems to give the best result and hence only this result is reported. The dataset is randomly split into to halves, one for training and the other testing purpose. Both the data sets have approximately 25,000 samples. We use the open source data mining package Weka version 3.5.5 [8] for our experiments. 4.3 Empirical Results First, we compare OR with multi-class classification (MC). The output consists of 5 labels { A,B,C,D,E } . For both the classifiers C4.5 decision tree is used as the base learner. OR is compared with one-against-all multi-class classification scheme. In case of OR we have a preference level attached between output labels. This information is absent in MC setting . The classification accuracy obtained from OR and MC is 86.21% and 83.8% respectively. Mean absolute error (MAE) for OR and MC is 0.066 and 0.2512 respectively. MAE is an important parameter for comparison between OR and MC [6]. So far the model is able to predict only a coarse time of churn (for example, between 12 and 15 months) of customers. We repeat our experiments for each rank to predict churn time at month level. MAE values are given inside the parenthesis . Accuracy and MAE results for ranks A, B, C, and D for OR is 67.51% (0.1339), 70.15% (0.162), 56.85% (0.1488) and 39.57% (0.1262) respectively. Accuracy and MAE results for ranks A, B, C, and D for MC is 64.45% (0.4548), 63.93% (0.3047), 54.58% (0.2449) and 39.53% (0.1726) respectively. We notice that OR is consistently more accurate than MC in generating predictions. We note that MAE is consistently lower for OR compared to MC.

Next, we compare OR with Cox proportional hazards (PH) model, [9], for predicting customer tenure at mont h level. We use the PROC PHREG proce-dure available in SAS/STAT R softwareforCoxPHmodel[4].CoxPHmodelis a semi-parametric survival regression technique using partial likelihood estima-tion. Cox PH model is useful when the form of survival distribution and hazard function are not known in advance. The results are reported using cumulative lift curve [1]. Figure 1 shows the cumulative lift curves by OR and PROC PHREG for 7 through 11 months. We notice that PROC PHREG captures 30-60% of churners in the top decile. Whereas, OR captures only about 20-40% of churners in the top decile. Figure 2 shows the cumulative lift curves by OR and PROC PHREG for 12 through 15 months. Here we notice that PROC PHREG is able to capture at most 20% of churners in the top decile. Whereas, OR captures about 20-45% of churners in the top decile. Top decile plots of ordinal regression and PROC PHREG for 16 though 21 months and 22 through 31 months are not presented here because of s pace limitations. However, the results from PROC PHREG for these time periods are worse relative to ordinal regression. Full set of results comparing OR and SA is given in our technical report [10]. We notice that PROC PHREG is able to make good predictions about customer churn when their tenure is short (7 to 11 months), where as when tenure prediction is desired for customers who have stayed fo r a considerably longer time with the service provider, PROC PHREG seems to d rastically decrea se its accuracy. OR on the other hand is seen to make predictions more uniformly. We anticipate this is due to the balanced datasize of training samples given for training ordinal regression units for each rank. In this paper we discussed the use of ordinal regression for modeling tenure of mobile telecommunication customers. Or dinal regression is compared with multi-class classification and is seen to perf orm better. Next we compared ordinal regression with state-of-the-art method for tenure modeling, survival analysis technique (Cox PH model). Ordinal regression is seen to make more uniform predictions about customer tenure co mpared to Cox X  X  model. We would like to emphasize here that ordinal regression is seen to perform better than survival analysis only on the Duke university data. Due to difficulty in getting real world data from telecommunication operators, we are unable to conduct experiments on some more datasets. In future we wish to model tenure of customers at other places where customer satisfaction plays an important role, like insurance and banking industry. We also wish to compare ordinal regression with parametric survival regression models and different ordinal regression learning schemes on tenure modeling data.
