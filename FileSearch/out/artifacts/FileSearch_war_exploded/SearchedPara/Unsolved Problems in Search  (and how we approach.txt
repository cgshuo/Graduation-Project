 Search applications have become ubiquitous and very successful. Ma jor advances have been made in understanding how to deliver effective results very efficiently for a class of queries. As the range social search, etc., the number of new research chal lenges has appeared to grow rather than shrink. Many of these challenges are variations on underl ying themes and principles that information retrieval has focused on for more than 40 years. In this talk, several unsolved problems arising from new search applications will be discussed and so me potential paths to solutions for these problems will be outlined.
