 1. Introduction one of the most important functions to be performed by the purchasing decision makers, which determines the long-term viability of the company. For most of the procurement/purchasing starting from the realization of the need for a new supplier; deter-screening and drawing up a shortlist of potential suppliers from a selected (i.e., continuous evaluation and assessment). been observed that more than one supplier is normally available for each product. Periodic evaluation of supplier quality is carried out to ensure relevant quality standards for all incoming products in the right quantity from the right source at the right time and at reasonable price . With the increase in use of quality management and just in time (JIT) concepts by a wide range of companies, the supplier selection decision has become even more critical ( Muralidharan et al., 2002 ). As customer X  X  demands are always uncertain, companies tend to manage their suppliers in different ways leading to a supplier X  X upplier development, supplier eva-luation, supplier selection, supplier association, supplier coordi-nation, etc. ( Chan, 2003 ; Jain et al., 2009 ).

Based on a synthesis of the literature and interviews of several industrial partners in the EU-I n Proms project ( www.iproms.org ), we present some of the extracted motivations for this study:
Motivation 1: The strategic nature of the supplier selection decision determines the long-term viability of the company.
However, the majority of the existing models/approaches/meth-ods are based on functional criteria like quality, price, delivery time, etc., and does not take into account the repercussions of the company strategy on the decisions by taking into account several siveness, etc. ( Chan and Kumar, 2007 ).

Motivation 2: The multi-criteria aspect of the supplier selection problem is an essential aspect when we deal with a global approach.
However, there are more studies emphasizing the use of mathe-matical programming based decision-making methods and total cost based approaches in particular. These approaches fail to address allocation and treat this significant aspect of the problem by impos-ing some assumptions and mainly converting qualitative criteria to quantitative criteria. A decision model that accommodates explicitly Kumar, 2007 ).

Motivation 3: The supplier selection problem requires decision or a set of decisions, which needs the intervention of different services (departments) of the company ( Dyer and Forman, 1992 ). The AHP method takes into account this aspect of the problem. Indeed, Saaty (1989 , 1990) has described group decision making with AHP, including suggestions for assembling the group, running the decision-making session, trying to get the group to agree, inequalities of power, concealed or distorted preferences and implementing the results. Moreover, in practice, smaller decision groups are more efficient but larger groups are often required for effective decision making so that stakeholders are represented and the final decision accepted, and implementation is facilitated ( Mitchell and Wasil, 1989 ).

Motivation 4: In practice, if a supplier cannot satisfy a minimal threshold compared to certain criterion, it cannot be selected in elimination method is the only method in the literature, which takes into account this aspect of the problem. But this method does not plan to choose the most powerful among qualified suppliers ( Mobolurin, 1995 ; Thompson, 1990 ). Indeed, with this method we are not interested by the total performance of the suppliers with respect to all the criteria. A method, which can take into account the conjunctive rules (minimal threshold) and choose the most powerful suppliers (by considering all the criteria) is a lack in the literature ( Jain et al., 2007 ).

Motivation 5: In the supplier selection problem, we have various constraints to take into account. These constraints are of different natures. It can be the constraints evoked by the suppliers such as minimal order quantity, maximum production capacity, etc. or the constraints of the customer like budget devoted to the purchasing activity, maximum rate of unqualified products, etc. In addition, if the company would wish several suppliers, it must choose at the same time the suppliers and the quantity to be ordered from each one . Consequently, only mathematical optimization methods can take these aspects of the problem under several restrictive assumptions. Moreover, these mathematical optimization methods supplier selection problem ( Ding et al., 2008 ).

Motivation 6: In reality, the future behaviors of the suppliers and the environment are uncertain. Consequently, it is difficult to assign a fixed mark to the suppliers with respect to a criterion. However, it is more practical to affect a fork of mark or a random variable, which describes the probabilistic behavior of the supplier and market using simulation. The scenario method treats this type of the markets and the supply chains, huge number of scenarios is with a solution ( Jain et al., 2009 ).

Motivation 7: Moreover, the previous synthesis shows us that the current methods have some limit s to cover the various aspects of the supplier selection problem with order splitting. Our objective is to build an approach, which can take into account all the character-istics of the problem: the strategy of the company, the multi-actors suppliers and customer (company), the multi-suppliers aspect, the probabilistic aspect (supplier behaviors and the economic environ-ment y ) and finally the order splitting aspects ( Wu et al., 2009 ; Guneri et al., 2009 ).

Motivation 8: Although, there are a large number of reported studies/papers addressing the d ecision criteria to be used for the address the need to include the crit eria related to risk, which have become extremely important given the present threats to security, how companies evaluate and select suppliers ( Chan and Kumar, 2007 ).
In this paper, we propose a two-phase decision making approach for group multi-criteria supplier selection problem, which integrates supplier selection process with order allocation. The first phase, suppliers are selected using fuzzy-AHP through four classes of
CLASS III: Innovation and CLASS IV: Risk). In the second phase, using and delivery) are quantitatively evaluated for order allocation among the selected suppliers.
 The purpose of this approach is to:
Determine preferred suppliers which can be geographically dispersed.

Focus business with preferred suppliers and build long term-strategic relationships based on all the four classes (perfor-mance, quality of service, innovation and risk).

Work with current and potential preferred suppliers to con-tinuously improve performance standards and enhance the suppliers X  position to receive future business opportunities. Determine the order allocation s trategy to adopt by the company.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates some complexities observed in the supplier selection processes by reviewing the most existing studies. Section 3 gives the structure of the considered supply chain with the subjected decision criteria for the selecting suppliers and order splitting. Section 4 presents the theoretical background of our work. Section 5 illustrates the proposed simulation-based knowledge approach. Section 6 gives an illustrative example. Section 7 concludes the paper with discussions and future directions. 2. Supplier selection and order allocation: state of the art
A number of research works published in the last decades emphasized the strategic importance of the supplier selection process. In this section, we limit our literature review to the works where supplier selection and order allocation are considered.
Moreover, we present the most recent published studies using techniques/methods such as analytic hierarchy process (AHP), analytic network process (ANP), technique for order performance by (P-SVM), preference programming (PP), fuzzy logic, case-based reasoning (CBR), mathematical programming (MP), etc.

Recently, Mafakheri et al. (2011) proposed a two-stage multi-criteria dynamic programming approach for supplier selection and order allocation problem. In the first stage, the AHP method is employed to address the multi-crit eria decision in supplier ranking.
In the second stage, order allocation model that aims at maximizing a utility function for the company as well as minimizing the total supply chain costs is proposed. Several logistics constraints are considered including demand constraints, capacity constraints and inventory levels constraints. To solve the bi-objective model, a dynamic programming approach is developed.

Rezaei and Davoodi (2011) developed two multi-objective mixed integer non-linear models for multi-period lot-sizing problems involving multiple products and multiple suppliers X  selection. The two models are constructed on the basis of three objective functions
The first model considers the case where shortage is not allowed while in the second model, all the demand during the stock-out period is backordered. Considering the complexity of two models, an adapted NSGA-II algorithm is proposed.
 nesses, Opportunities and Threats) in the context of supplier selection for the first time. SWOT analysis can consider both qualitative and quantitative criteria. Moreover, to deal with vagueness of human thought, fuzzy logic and triangular fuzzy numbers are integrated with SWOT analysis. The decision makers can understand the position of suppliers in a competitive envir-onment with a glance at SWOT matrix. To determine orders allocation among selected suppliers, a fuzzy linear programming model is proposed, where the demand is a fuzzy number and the warehouse operates under a constraint capacity. To demonstrate the efficiency of the developed model, a case study is used. the effects of interdependence among the selection criteria (price, quality, delivery and technique), as well as to achieve optimal order allocation among the selected suppliers. The proposed method accordingly incorporates two stages: (i) combine ANP with fuzzy
PP into a more powerful fuzzy AN P (FANP) to select suppliers, and (ii) apply multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) to determine order allocation among selected suppliers.
 munication company in the global system for mobile (GSM) sector,
Onut et al. (2009) presented an integrated FANP and fuzzy TOPSIS (FTOPSIS) methodology. Contrary to conventional FANP method, triangular fuzzy numbers in all pairwise comparison matrices are used. Therefore, criteria (cost, references, quality of the product, delivery time, institutionality, execution time) weights are inserted to the FTOPSIS methodology to rank the suppliers for selection. based on hierarchical potential support vector machine. Developed in statistical learning theory, P-SVM can perform selection and classification simultaneously. The proposed method combines
P-SVM and decision tree into a new algorithm called as hierarchical potential support vector machine, which is applied by transforming supplier selection to multiclass classification problem. using ANP and mixed integer programming (MIP) to select suppliers when the bundling strategy existed is proposed by Wu et al. (2009) . gathered from experts by using Delphi method, are used to construct an ANP model. Thereafter, the ANP results are used as coefficients of an objective function in MIP to allocate order quantities to selected suppliers.
 gramming approach to solve the mu ltiple sourcing supplier selec-tion problems. Firstly, linguistic values expressed in trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are applied to assess weights and ratings of supplier selection criteria including relationship closeness, reputation and position in industry, performance history, conflict resolution and delivery capability. Then a hierarchy multiple model based on fuzzy set is expressed and fuzzy positive and negative ideal solutions are the coefficients of suppliers, suppliers X  quality and capacity con-straint, and buyer X  X  budgeting, a linear programming model is developed to identify the best su ppliers and their optimum order quantities. A simple case study fr om textile industry is presented and the obtained numerical results are analyzed.
 integrating fuzzy CBR (FCBR) and mathematical programming (MP) model for supplier selection problem with order allocation. The approach aims to improve the conventional CBR systems in order to cover the fuzzy parameters in supplier selection problem decisions.
Furthermore, a mixed integer programming model is employed to simultaneously consider suitable supplier selection and order allocation; due to the purchase sit uation of suppliers derived from the CBR system, and with respect to realistic constraints such as buyer X  X  demand and suppliers X  capacity.

Wang et al. (2008a) considered an n -capacity supplier, single item inventory system, where the suppliers have different lead times and purchase prices. An int eger linear programming model is proposed to help managers select the optimal suppliers and deter-mine both the reorder level and split suborders of each selected supplier for a given order quantity so that the total average inventory cost is minimum and constraints of supplier ability, quality and demand are considered. Moreover, Sanayei et al. (2008) proposed an integrated approach using multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) and linear programming for rating and selecting the best suppliers, and defining the optimum order quantities among selected ones in order to maximize the quantity of purchase from the most desired suppliers (i.e., total additive utility).
Demirtas and  X  Ust  X  un (2008) proposed a two-stage integrated approach to select suppliers and determine their shipment allocations given a number of qualitative and quantitative criteria.
An integration of ANP and multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MOMILP) techniques is suggested. In the first stage, suppliers are selected using both ANP and AHP. To over-come the drawbacks of AHP, although an increase in the number of pairwise comparisons and more complex calculations, priori-ties are calculated by using ANP. In the second stage of the approach, the weights computed by ANP and AHP serve as coefficients in the objective function of the MOMILP model used to allocate the orders among suppliers.

Lee (2008) developed an innovativ e analytical approach to evaluate the forms of buyer X  X upplier relationship between a man-ufacture and its supplier. A fuzzy AHP (FAHP) model, which constructed to deal with supplier selection problem.

Finally, Aissaoui et al. (2007) presented a comprehensive litera-ture review of the supplier selection and order lot-sizing modeling.
The review covers the entire purc hasing process, considers both parts and services outsourcing activities, and covers internet-based procurement environments. Furt hermore, the review proposes classifications of the published pap ers. The literature is rich with quantitative models using mathe matical programming to address the supplier selection problem with order allocation (linear programming ( Pan, 1989 ), goal programming ( Buffa and Jackson, 1983 ), mixed integer programming approach ( Basnet and Leung, 2005 ; Rosenthal et al., 1995 ; Chaudhry et al., 1993 )andmixed integer nonlinear programming approach ( Ghodsypour and O X  X rien, able to address explicitly the qualitative criteria used for supplier problem by imposing some assumptions and mainly converting quali-tative criteria to quantitative criteria.

In summary, the existing literature is very rich with several approaches/models/methods proposed for the supplier selection problem with order allocation. To overcome the drawbacks of these methods, we propose a novel approach, which integrates supplier selection with order allocation and where the supply chain decision makers X  expertises are efficiently captured through a knowledge based system for improving the procurement activities in dynamic supply chains. 3. Problem environment 3.1. Problem setting
Our supply chain comprises of a set of K potential suppliers, a unique distribution center (DC) and a unique market (customer). The transportation activity is taken care by the sub-criteria related to the quality of delivery. The problem consists of two sub-problems. The first sub-proble m concerns with the selection of which is by assumption more than one year. Where, the second sub-problem deals with the order allocation strategy among the selected suppliers. A supplier that is selected in a given  X  X election horizon X  is not necessarily selected in another one; a new list of potential suppliers is created at the end of each  X  X election horizon X  for the next. The  X  X election horizons X  are independent. Fig. 1 illus-trates the considered supply chain.

Market: Entity where the initial demands of a single product type center (DC). The demand could be modeled as a sequence of specific market orders (obtained from historical records) or as an aggregated demand during a period following any distribution law. Attributes related to this entity are respect ively, demand quantity, demand frequency and expected delivery date.

Distribution center (DC): Intermediate entity between suppliers and market, the DC plays a critical role in our case. The inventory held in the DC is replenished according to some given inventory control policies. Several classical inventory control policies, such as base stock, lot for lot, etc., are defined and implemented in the simulation package. It places purchasing orders to suppliers and receives deliveries from suppliers through transportation links. Main attributes are storage capacity, handling capacity, operation cost and inventory cost. Relevant costs are inventory holding cost, ordering cost and over-capacity cost.

Supplier: Source entity where material flow originates. It provides raw materials, components, semi-fi nished and even final products to the DC, which, further on the basis of its inventory control policy, will deliver them to the market. We are not considering the process of manufacturing the products by suppliers and no explicit capacity limitation for them. 3.2. Decision criteria
Supplier selection decisions are complicated by the fact that various criteria must be considered in decisions making process. The analysis of such criteria for the selection, measuring the performances of potential suppliers and the introduction of a new categories of selection criteria following the market evolutions have been the focus of many researchers and purchasing practi-tioners since the 1960s.

Unlike, the other researchers, we have classified the supplier mention that the following four classes were defined based on our exhaustive literature review survey, including our own published papers related to supplier selection in particular and procurement strategies in general. Other classes can also be defined and easily be incorporated in the developed framework following the need of the company decision makers. (a) Class I : Performance strategy
Quality Percentage of products which qualify the
Pricing Unit price communicated by each
Age and position in the market
Environmental engagement (b) Class II: Quality of service
Delivery Percentage of the products delivered in time
Service after sale
Preventive actions
Corrective actions (c) Class III: Innovation
Research and development 4. Theoretical background well discussed concept with several applications, in this section the theoretical background of proposed approach is highlighted.
In many situations where performance rating and weights cannot be given precisely, the fuzzy set theory is introduced to model the uncertainty of human judgments and such problems is known as fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (FMCDM). Bellman and
Zadeh (1970) first introduced fuzzy set theory into MCDM as an approach for effectively dealing with the inherent imprecision, vagueness and ambiguity of the human decision making process. 4.1. Fuzzy set and fuzzy numbers was introduced by Zadeh (1965) for dealing with uncertainty and imprecision associated with information. As shown in Kaufmann and Gupta (1988 , 1991 ), the preliminary of fuzzy set theory used in this research work are as follows:
Definition 1. A fuzzy number is a quantity whose value is valued) numbers. Any fuzzy number can be thought of as a function whose domain is a specified set usually the set of real numbers, and whose range is the span of non-negative real numbers between, and including, 0 and 1. Each numerical value in the domain is assigned a specific  X  X  X rade of membership X  X  where 0 represents the smallest possible grade, and 1 is the largest possible grade.
 membership function:
Definition 2. Let ~ a 1  X  X  l 1 , m 1 , u 1  X  and ~ a 2  X  X  l gular fuzzy numbers, then the vertex method is defined to calculate the distance between them as d  X  ~ a 1 , ~ a 2  X  X  main operations of triangular fuzzy numbers are as follows: ~ a 1 ~ a 2  X  X  l 1  X  l 2 , m 1  X  m 2 , u 1  X  u 2  X  X  3  X  ~ a
Y ~ a 2  X  X  l 1 l 2 , m 1 m 2 , u 1 u 2  X  X  4  X  ~ a 1 ~ a 2  X  X  l 1 l 2 , m 1 m 2 , u 1 u 2  X  X  5  X  ~ a ~ a  X  ~ a 1 k  X  X  l 1 k , m 1 k , u 1 k  X  , for each k A R  X  7  X  4.2. Fuzzy AHP (analytic hierarchy process)
The AHP is widely used for tackling multi-attribute decision problem in real situations. Many papers have concluded that AHP is a useful, practical and systematic method for supplier selection.
However, in practice, crisp data are often inadequate to model real life situation since human judgment are vague. In this section, we review the main steps of the fuzzy AHP method, which is basically the combination between two concepts: fuzzy set theory and AHP. Fuzzy AHP is used in this paper for supplier selection.

Chang (1996) proposed an extent analysis method, which derives crisp weights for fuzzy comparison matrices. Wang et al. (2008b) showed by examples that the priority vectors determined by the extent analysis method of Chang (1996) do not represent the relative importance of decision criteria and the misapplication of the extent analysis method to fuzzy AHP problems may lead to a wrong decision to be made. In this section, we briefly summar-ize the used Wang et al. (2008b) corrected extent analysis method. Consider a triangular fuzzy comparison matrix given by ~
A Step 1: sum up each row of the fuzzy comparison matrix ~ A
RS
Step 2: normalization of sums as ~
S  X  RS i P n Step 3: compute the degree of possibility of ~ S i Z ~ S j
V  X  ~
S i Z ~ S j  X  X  fuzzy numbers
V  X  ~
S i Z ~ S j 9 j  X  1 , ... , n ; j a i  X  X  min Step 5: define the priority vector W  X  X  w 1 , ... , w n  X  comparison matrix w  X 
The hierarchy of attributes is the subject of a pairwise compar-ison of the AHP. After constructing a hierarchy, decision makers are asked to compare the elements at a given level on a pairwise basis in at the immediately preceding level. 4.3. Fuzzy TOPSIS
Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is one of the most classical methods for solving MCDM problem ( Hwang and Yoon, 1981 ). It is based on the principle that the chosen alternative should have the longest distance from the negative-ideal solution, i.e. the solution that maximizes the cost criteria and minimizes the benefi ts criteria; and the shortest TOPSIS, the rating and weight of the criteria are known precisely. In fuzzy TOPSIS, all the ratings and weights are defined by means of linguistic variables. A number of fuzzy TOPSIS based methods and applications have been developed in recent years. The approach to extend the TOPSIS method to fuzzy data used in this study can be outlined as follows: Step 1: Construct the fuzzy decision matrix
Assume there are m alternatives A i ( i  X  1, 2, y , m )tobe MADM can be concisely expressed in matrix format as formula-tion (13). ~ D W  X  X  ~ w 1 , ~ w 2 , ... , ~ w n  X  13  X  ~ x is the performance rating of the i th alternative A i with respect Z . Moreover, ~ x ij and ~ w j , i  X  1,2, y , m and j  X  1,2, fuzzy numbers given as ~ w  X  X  w j 1 , w j 2 , w j 3  X  and Step 2: Normalize the fuzzy decision matrix
The raw data are normalized to eliminate anomalies with different measurement units and scales in several MCDM problems. However, the purpose of linear scales transform normalization function used in this study is to preserve the property that the ranges of normalized triangular fuzzy numbers to be included in [0, 1]. If ~ R Denotes the normalized fuzzy decision matrix, then ~ R  X  X  ~ r ij m n , i  X  1 , 2 , ... , m and j  X  1 , 2 , ... , n  X  14  X  where for fuzzy data denoted by triangular fuzzy number as ( l u ), the normalized values for benefit-related criteria ( B )andcost-related criteria ( C ) are calculated as follows: ~ r  X  ~ r  X  ( where u  X  j  X  max i u ij if j A B and l j  X  min i l ij if j Step 3: Construct weighted normalized fuzzy decision matrix
Considering the weight of each criterion, the weighted normal-ized decision matrix can be computed by multiplying the impor-tance weights of evaluated criteria and the values in the normalized fuzzy decision matrix. The weighted normalized decision matrix defined as ~
V  X  X  ~ v ij m n , i  X  1 , 2 , ... , m ; j  X  1 , 2 , ... , n  X  17  X  ~ v  X  ~ r ij ~ w ij  X  18  X  where ~ w ij is fuzzy weight of the criterion Z j .

Step 4: Determine the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution
Because the positive triangular fuzzy numbers are included in the interval [0, 1], the fuzzy positive ideal reference point (FPIRP) denoted by A  X  and fuzzy negative ideal reference point (FNIRP) denoted by A can be defined as
A Step 5: Calculate the distances of each initial alternative to FPIRP and FNIRP.

The distance of each alternative from fuzzy positive ideal reference point and fuzzy negative ideal reference point can be derived respectively as: d  X  d  X 
A from FPIRP and d i is the distance of alternative A i from FNIRP.
Step 6: Obtain the closeness coefficient and rank the alter-natives Calculate the closeness coefficient ( CC i ) of each alternative as
CC  X 
An alternative with CC i approaching 1 indicates that the alter-native is close to the fuzzy positive ideal reference point and far from the fuzzy negative ideal reference point. The alternative with the highest CC value will be the best choice. 4.4. Knowledge management
The literature is very rich with several algorithms and techni-ques for knowledge management such as ID3 ( Quinlan, 1983 ), ID5 we present the flow-chart of the  X  X nductive learning algorithm called RULES X  proposed by Pham and Aksoy (1993) . The inductive learning algorithm is used for extracting IF-THEN rules from exam-rules for a collection of objects belong to a given set of rules and where an object must be presented by set of attributes and each attribute have set of values. The attribute-value pair constitutes a condition. The number of attributes is n a , and a rule may contain between 1 and n a conditions. Fig. 2 illustrates the flow chart of RULES algorithm.
 5. Proposed simulation-based knowledge approach 5.1. General structure of knowledge-based simulation platform The proposed platform is composed of three levels: User;
Front-end interface and Back-end integrated application. The back-end integrated application is composed of 4 modules: net-work module, fuzzy module, knowledge-based discrete event simulator and knowledge and database module ( Fig. 3 ). Network module
This module prepares the structure of the candidate chain for simulation, with initial data such as the considered vector of knowledge X  X  of potential suppliers (knowledge related to the four classes of criteria in our case) and the associated para-meters of each entity (supplier, DC and market). In our case, the list of potential suppliers will be updated at the end of each
Start n =0 yes n = n +1
Is n &gt; n ?
End no yes supplier selection period denoted by H 1 (selection horizon). At the end of each period H 1 ,itispossiblethatoneormore suppliers will join and others will be eliminated from the list of potential suppliers. H 2 (order allocation horizon), we denote by the time between two revisions of the orders allocation rates related to the selected suppliers.
 Knowledge-based discrete event simulator module
When a candidate network is available (i.e., list of potential suppliers  X  DC  X  Market) it can be executed within the knowl-edge-based discrete event simulator as another major compo-nent of the platform. Again user-friendliness is an important issue for the development of the simulation module, which is mainly addressed by a set of GUI (Graphical User Interface) components for the specification of the parameters related to simulation, control of simulation, execution and finally the assessment of simulation data.
 Knowledge acquisition module
The ability to acquire knowledge paces with the dynamics of the supplier selection procedure. The knowledge acquisition procedure plays an important role in regularly updating the knowledge using the recent variations of both market fluctua-tions and potential suppliers.
 Fuzzy module
A triangular fuzzy membership function (TFN) is used for the fuzzification and defuzzification. Five linguistics variables are used to assess the importance weights: very high (VH), high (H), medium (M), poor (P) and very poor (VP) ( Table 1 ). 6. An illustrative example
Ten potential suppliers are considered where the number of suppliers to select is fixed to three. Each three months, new order allocation rates are calculated. We denote by C 1 : Performance strategy, C 2 : Quality of service, C 3 : Innovation and C 6.1. Group decision matrix aggregation
Five decision makers (DM 1 ,DM 2 ,DM 3 ,DM 4 and DM 5 )providein linguistic forms five pairwise comparison matrices ( Tables 2 X 6 ). 6.2. Supplier selection using fuzzy-AHP
The hierarchy structure of the considered global supplier selec-tion is illustrated in Fig. 4 . Table 7 presents the aggregate com-selection). To compute the matrix, we use the formulas proposed equations: l  X  min simulator Knowledge Database Module m u  X  max The consistency index is calculated by ( B  X  uy  X  uk  X  ozkam and Feyzioglu, 2004 )
CI  X  l max n n 1  X  27  X  where n is the number of criteria in general (4 classes in our case) and l max is calculated by normalization of each column of the comparison matrix presented in Table 7 . The consistency ratio is given by CR  X  CI RC  X  28  X  The average random consistency index is shown in Table 8 . In our example n  X  4 and RC  X  0.9
CI  X  4 : 12 4 4 1  X  0 : 04 , CR  X  0 : 04 0 : 9  X  0 : 044 o 0
Therefore, we decided to include this aggregate comparison matrix, which respects the condition (CR  X  0.044 o 0.1).
Using the extent formulations (8) to (12), we have the follow-ing results where A i corresponds to the fuzzy synthetic extent value with respect to class C i ( i  X  1, 2, 3, 4) and M the minimum degree of possibility.

A  X  X  0 : 16 , 0 : 50 , 0 : 68  X

The weight vector W of the 4 criteria is given by (0.5, 0.27, 0.16, 0.7) where w  X 
Similarly, the weight vector of each criterion Z i with respect to its class and the corresponding weight vector of each supplier with respect to each criterion are also calculated. At the end, we compute the weight of each supplier with respect to main four classes (see Table 9 ).

We can conclude that suppliers S 1 ,S 2 and S 3 are the best three suppliers among the list of ten potential suppliers. 6.3. Simulation and knowledge management
By assumption, the simulation and selection horizon is equal to one year (48 weeks) and order allocation horizon is equal to where Q  X  500 units and s  X  200 units. Moreover, each week, the DC receives a certain demand quantity with respect to the market planning demand. Moreover, we use only three criteria, respec-tively cost, quality and delivery to determine the order allocation ratios. After the simulation run, Table 10 presents, for each supplier, the evolution of  X  X elivery X  given in linguistics values. Table 11 shows the corresponding fuzzy values.

As a first tentative to define attributes related to criteria quality Tables 12 and 15 present the generated training examples. The proposed training rules for quality are: If Quality of packaging  X  I then Quality  X  H If Quality of finishing  X  B then Quality  X  M If Sizing  X  1 then Quality  X  VH
After a simulation of one year of activities, for each supplier and each delivery, new linguistics values are calculated for quality (see Table 13 ). Table 14 shows the corresponding fuzzy values.
 The proposed training rules for price are: If Price duty-free  X  I then Price  X  VH If Price duty-free  X  II then Price  X  M If Duties  X  1 then Price  X  H If Duties  X  2 then Price  X  M
After a simulation of one year activities, for each supplier and each delivery, new linguistics values are calculated for price ( Table 16 ). Table 17 illustrates the corresponding fuzzy values. 6.4. Order allocation using fuzzy-TOPSIS
Tables 18 X 20 show the comparison matrices of the three criteria respectively price, quality and delivery, with respect to the overall objective (order allocation). A  X  and A are calculated using formulas (15) to (24).
 three selected suppliers. By normalizing CC i , we calculate the order allocation ( O i ) of each supplier.

CC i  X  d  X  supplier i , A  X  d  X  supplier supplier. Tables 22 X 24 show the comparison matrix of the three criteria, respectively, price, quality and delivery, with respect to the overall objective (order allocation). A  X  and A are given by A
Now, we can compute the closeness coefficients of the three selected suppliers as shown by Table 25 . Furthermore, Table 26 provides the order allocations of the three selected suppliers for the four periods. 7. Conclusions and perspectives
In this era of global competition, the modern business companies pay particular attention to the identification and selection among process is very important to the success of any manufacturing company. This paper presents a new decision making approach for group multi-criteria supplier selection problem, which clubs supplier selection process with order allocation for dynamic supply chains to cope market variations. The developed approach imitates the knowledge acquisition and manipulation in a manner similar to the decision maker who has gathered considerable knowledge and expertise in procurement domain. Fuzzy-AHP is used first for supplier selection through four clas ses (performance strategy, qual-ity of service, innovation and risk) . Thereafter, simulation based fuzzy TOPSIS is applied to determine the weights for order allocation among selected suppliers. A simple example is presented to demon-strate the applicability of the proposed approach.

Future researches may focus on the case where suppliers are operating with limited supply capacity. Moreover, the definition of other classes of criteria and sub-criteria either specific to the to implement other knowledge-based rules such as RULES-6 ( Pham and Afifi, 2005 )andRULES-5( Pham et al., 2003 ) and use trapezoidal fuzzy numbers instead of triangular ones.
