 While online social networks have become a part of many people X  X  daily lives, Internet and social network addictions (ISNAs) have been noted recently. With increased patients in addictive Internet use, clinicians often form support groups to help patients. This has become a trend because groups or-ganized around therapeutic goals can effectively enrich mem-bers with insight and guidance while holding everyone ac-countable along the way. With the emergence of online social network services, there is a trend to form support groups on-line with the aid of mental health professionals. Nevertheless, it becomes impractical for a psychiatrist to manually select the group members because she faces an enormous number of candidates, while the selection criteria are also compli-cated since they span both the social and symptom dimen-sions. To effectively address the need of mental healthcare professionals, this paper makes the first attempt to study a new problem, namely Member Selection for Online Support Group (MSSG). The problem aims to maximize the similar-ity of the symptoms of all selected members, while ensuring that any two members are unacquainted to each other. We prove that MSSG is NP-Hard and inapproximable within any ratio, and design a 3-approximation algorithm with a guar-anteed error bound. We evaluate MSSG via a user study with 11 mental health professionals, and the results manifest that MSSG can effectively find support group members satis-fying the member selection criteria. Experimental results on large-scale real datasets also demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms other baselines in terms of solution quality and efficiency.

Today, online social networks have become a part of many people X  X  daily lives. While bringing many advantages, some Internet and social network addictions (ISNAs) , such as parasocial, information overloading, and net compulsion, have been noted recently [29]. Leading literature in mental health, such as American Journal of Psychiatry [8], has re-ported that the above addictions may incur excessive use, de-pression, social withdrawal, and negative repercussions. Tra-ditional studies of addictions have mainly focused on drug de-pendence, which may alter the brain function. Recent studies point out that ISNAs may also incur negative impacts on the brain function. Note that the above addictive behavior trig-gers a reward system in the brain called Mesolimbic dopamin-ergic pathway, which most notably includes ventral tegmental area, ventral striatum, nucleus accumbens and other adjunct neurons close to the midline on the floor of the midbrain. The reward system leads to a thorny clinical disease, starting with physically over-stimulation of this system. The psychological euphoric effects then lead to repeat behavior, which gradu-ally distorts a person X  X  cognition. As a result, the person will be used to seek for euphoria without considering its outcome.
ISNAs, which represent excessive and uncontrolled behav-ior of using Internet and social apps, have been identified to have serious negative impacts on human behavior [28]: 1) ex-cessive use of social networking and messaging apps  X  usually associated with a loss of the sense of time or a neglect of basic drives; 2) withdrawal  X  including feelings of anger, tension, and/or depression when the computer/apps are inaccessible; 3) tolerance  X  including the need for better computer equip-ment, more software and apps; and 4) negative repercussions  X  including arguments, lying, poor achievement, social iso-lation, and fatigue [8]. With increased patients in addictive Internet use, clinical interventions are considered as impera-tive as potential patients may suffer from social withdrawal, social impairment and emotional disturbances prospectively. Clinicians often provide an individual counseling session or a support group to help patients. In clinical settings, group therapy has become a trend because groups organized around therapeutic goals can effectively enrich members with insight and guidance [25], while holding everyone accountable along the way [1].

Recently, psychological researchers conclude that cognitive behavior therapy, in the form of group therapy plus other multi-modal school-based group therapy, is effective for IS-NAs, particularly in improving emotional states and regula-tion ability, behavioral and self-management style [12, 24]. Effectively creating therapeutic recovery of emotion facilita-tion, it has been proved to be the predominant modality for treating addiction disorders [16, 19].

For a mental health professional to form a therapy group or support group (referred to as a support group hereafter) for ISNAs, three crucial criteria are usually considered: (i) un-familiarity of patients, (ii) similarity of symptoms, and (iii) the size of a support group [10]. Unfamiliarity of patients and similarity of symptoms are two cornerstones for form-ing a therapy group. When the patients are unacquainted (unfamiliar) with each other, they are more inclined to share without hesitation, as private information and experiences are unlikely to spread among friends. With a similar symp-tom, patients are able to help each other better. Moreover, when the group is small, a patient will be less confident in receiving assistance from the group. However, traditional group therapy usually extracts patients from the same hos-pital or clinic. Due to a small pool of candidates, patients of different diseases are forced to group together. Other-wise, the formed group may have an insufficient number of patients. Not surprising, it will significantly deteriorate the quality of group therapy.

With the emergence of online social network services, there is a trend to form support groups online with the aid of men-tal health professionals, such as online group therapies in talkspace 1 and online group counseling 2 . Nevertheless, it be-comes impractical for a psychiatrist to manually select the group members because she faces an enormous number of candidates. The task is challenging for a psychiatrist due to the careful examination required in two dimensions: 1) the social dimension  X  to guarantee unfamiliarity; and 2) the symptom dimension  X  to ensure similarity. Moreover, manu-ally forming a group is inclined to introduce human bias and errors. To effectively address the need of mental healthcare professionals, this paper makes the first attempt to study a new problem, namely Member Selection for Online Support Group (MSSG) . The problem aims to maximize the similarity of the symptoms of all selected members, while ensuring that any two members are unacquainted to each other. MSSG can support psychiatrists and has a great potential to make a change on the current practice to avoid serious consequences caused by human bias and errors. To solve the problem, we design an algorithm, called Support Group Member Selection (SGSel) , which selects suitable members to form a support group. In addition, we provide a quantitative measure for the group quality.

The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. http://www.talkspace.com/public/forums-page. http://www.onlinecounselingfast.com/group-counseling/.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 re-views the related works. Sec. 3 formulates Member Selection for Online Support Group (MSSG) problem, and proves that MSSG is NP-Hard and inapproximable within any factor. Sec. 4 details the proposed algorithm and Sec. 5 analyzes its performance. Sec. 6 introduces two pruning strategies to enhance the proposed algorithm. Sec. 7 presents a user study and experimental results. Finally, Sec. 8 concludes this paper.
Addictive disorders, a disease categorized in substance-related and addictive disorders in DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition)) [4], is defined as a persistent and compulsive dependent on either substances or behavior. In most of the cases, the continu-ity of dependence often leads to reversible mood alerting [6]. Recent research works report a number of factors related to ISNAs. Barker [7] finds that collective self-esteem and group identification are correlated with peer group communication via social network services. Cheung et al. [11] assess the role of social presence, such as the recognition and endorse-ment from others. To effectively tackle this disease, self-help oriented, cognitive behavior oriented, and reality-therapy ori-ented group therapies have been studied. The cognitive be-havior oriented therapy provides step-by-step approaches to stop compulsive behavior. Research shows that cognitive be-havior group therapy is effective for adolescents with men-tal disorders [12, 24]. The reality-therapy oriented group, a therapeutic group model designed by choice theory to help individuals control their behavior, has been widely used as a treatment for addictive disorders [17, 21]. In addition, group therapy has been proved to be the predominant method for treating addiction disorders [16, 19] and thus widely adopted by mental healthcare professionals.

Various social cohesive measures have been proposed for finding dense social subgraphs, e.g., diameter, clique and its variations [23]. Although these social cohesive measures cover a wide range of application scenarios, they focus on deriving socially tight groups for team formation [18, 20] and activity planning [22, 27]. In contrast, the Member Selec-tion for Online Support Group (MSSG) studied in this paper aims to extract a sparse social group and maximize the sim-ilarity in the symptoms of the group members, i.e., sparse in the social dimension but dense in the symptom dimension. Therefore, the problem formulation and hardness result are different from the previous ones. Most importantly, the above works and ideas are not applicable to MSSG due to the in-terplay of two dimensions, i.e., similarity of symptoms and unfamiliarity of the patients.
Forming a support group online indeed provides more op-portunities to choose proper patients. Nevertheless, it be-comes much more challenging for a psychiatrist to manually select the group member since the social and symptom di-mensions of a large number of candidates are necessary to be carefully examined. In this section, we study the Member Se-lection for Online Support Group (MSSG) problem that takes into account unfamiliarity of patients, similarity of symp-toms, and the minimum size of a support group.
Specifically, we model the social network as a heteroge-neous social graph G = ( V, E, S ), where V is the set of indi-viduals (including users with ISNAs and normal users), E is the set of friend edges denoting the existing social relation-ships, and S is the set of similarity edges . Each similarity edge is associated with a weight w : S  X  (0 , 1]. An individ-ual v is associated with a set of symptom labels L v . A score s ( l v,i )  X  [0 , 1] for each symptom label l v,i  X  L v represents the severity level for v to be suffering from the symptom i . The symptom labels and the corresponding edge scores can be ac-quired by clinical counseling from mental health professionals or machine-learning approaches (discussed in [2]). Moreover, any two vertices u and v are connected by a similarity edge if L u and L v share at least one symptom. The vertex set V in G can be represented as V = A  X  N , where A is the set of users with ISNAs, and N is the set of normal users. We adopt Euclidean Distance as the similarity measure of users with ISNAs, i.e., w [ u, v ] = i represents a symptom, and w [ u, v ] is the similarity edge weight. We then normalize the similarity edge weights to (0 , 1]. Euclidean Distance has been proved to be useful in grouping patients according to their symptoms [3].
Given a heterogeneous social graph G = ( V, E, S ) de-scribed above, we formulate the Member Selection for On-line Support Group (MSSG) problem to find a group F of patients from G to 1) maximize the similarity of symptoms in the group, i.e., the group has the largest average similar-ity edge weight among patients, 2) ensure the social unfa-miliarity, i.e., any pair of members are not friends, and they do not have common friends, 3 and 3) ensure the size of the group at least p . 4 Given vertices u, v  X  F , we denote w ( F ) the total similarity of F , i.e., w ( F ) =
The small world property of social network states that peo-ple are connected via a small number of friends. Therefore, randomly selecting members to form a support group may easily find acquaintances and friends X  friend. MSSG aims to maximize the similarity among members while satisfying the unfamiliarity constraint simultaneously. This makes MSSG very challenging computationally.
We do not consider the upper bound of group size b p here for simplicity. The proposed SGSel algorithm in Sec. 4 itera-tively removes vertices from the graph to construct candidate
Figure 1: Graph Transformation from G f to b G f .  X  ( F ) is the average similarity of F , i.e.,  X  ( F ) = w ( F ) MSSG, a similarity constraint s is also incorporated, which excludes a vertex u from V if all of u  X  X  incident similarity edges have weights smaller than s . This similarity constraint avoids examining and including potential patients dissimilar to the others. Moreover, we refer to G f = ( V, E ) as the so-cial graph representing the friendships of the individuals, and G m = ( V, S ) as the similarity graph denoting the similarity of the symptoms for individuals. The problem is formulated as follows.
 Problem: Member Selection for Online Support Group (MSSG) Given: A social network G = ( V, E, S ), size constraint p , and similarity constraint s .
 Objective: Find an induced subgraph F  X  G with max-imum  X  ( F ) where i) each vertex in F is with ISNAs, i.e., and  X  r  X  V such that ( u, r ) , ( r, v )  X  E , and iv)  X  [ u, v ]  X  S such that w [ u, v ]  X  s,  X  u  X  F .

For any instance of M SSG ( G, p, s ), we first transform the input graph G = ( V, E, S ) into a complement graph b G = ( V, b E, S ) in the social dimension. b G contains the same vertex set V and the same similarity edge set S . The trans-formed edge set b E is constructed by satisfying the following conditions. 1) For any u, v  X  V , ( u, v )  X  b E if u and v are not friends. 2) If  X  r  X  V with r as the common friend of u and v , u and v do not share an edge in b E .
 Example. Fig. 1 is an example illustrating the transfor-mation from G f = ( V, E ) (i.e., the original social graph) to b G f = ( V, b E ) (i.e., the transformed social graph), where the original and the complement graphs are shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. Any edge ( u, v )  X  b E is present if u and v does not share an edge in E . Moreover, ( a, b ), ( b, d ), and ( c, f ) do not appear in b E because each of them shares at least one common friend in G f .

With b G , it can be observed that a group F is the optimal solution to an instance of M SSG ( G, p, s ) if and only if F is a clique in b G f = ( V, b E ), while F has the same  X  ( F ) in both G and b G . We now formulate the tackled problem on the trans-formed graph b G , namely, Complement Member Selection for Online Support Group (CMSSG) . The problem is different from the traditional clique or social cohesive problems due to the similarity dimension incorporated.
 Problem: Complement Member Selection for Online Support Group (CMSSG) Given: A social network b G = ( V, b E, S ), size constraint p , and similarity constraint s .
 Objective: Find an induced subgraph F  X  b G with max-imum  X  ( F ) where i) each vertex in F is with ISNAs, i.e.,  X  [ u, v ]  X  S such that w [ u, v ]  X  s,  X  u  X  F . groups. Thus it is not difficult to modify SGSel for finding the best group with size at most b p . Figure 2: Running Example for Algorithm SGSel.
 Please note that, a group F is the optimal solution to CM SSG ( b G, p, s ) if and only if F is the optimal solution to its counterpart M SSG ( G, p, s ). A straightforward approach for CMSSG is to handle the social and similarity dimensions in two separate phases: 1) It first finds the maximum clique K max in the social graph b G f = ( V, b E ). Maximum clique K max ensures that every two vertices of K max are connected by an edge in b E and maximizes the number of individuals in K max . The maximum clique problem is NP-Hard. Thus, an approximation algorithm (e.g., [13]) can be adopted. 2) Afterward, if | K max | X  p , the second phase processes the sim-ilarity graph b G m = ( V, S ) induced from only the individuals in K max . Specifically, it finds the weighted dense k subgraph (DkS) on K max . Weighted DkS finds a group F  X   X  K max of exactly k vertices to maximize k X  ( F ). In the second phase, weighted DkS iteratively considers p  X  k  X  | K max | , and ex-tracts the group with maximum similarity. The weighted DkS problem is also NP-Hard, and thus an approximation algorithm (e.g., [14]) can be adopted.

However, this straightforward approach has two serious pitfalls. 1) In the first phase, only one subgraph K max b G is examined, and the optimal solution of CMSSG may not be within K max but located in another clique in b G . In other words, the solution exploration space is very lim-ited. 2) In the second phase, the best approximation ratio of weighted DkS is O ( | K max | 1 3 log | K max | ) [14]. Therefore, even when a good subgraph K max is acquired in the first phase, the second phase can only guarantee that  X  ( F )  X   X  ( OP T )  X  1 solution. The performance bound on the similarity is practi-cally useless because | K max | can be arbitrarily large. Example. Consider the example in Fig. 2, where b G f (i.e., the transformed social graph) and b G m (i.e., the sim-ilarity graph) are shown in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b), respec-tively. Let p = 4. The straightforward approach first obtains the approximated maximum clique K max = { a, b, c, d, e, f } , and then finds the approximated weighted DkS in K max as b timal solution F OP T = { h, i, j, k, g } with  X  ( F OP T This example manifests that the straightforward approach performs poorly.
The above two-phase strategy indicates that CMSSG is very challenging because processing only one of the social and similarity dimensions is already very difficult. In the follow-ing, we prove that there exists no approximation algorithm for CMSSG due to the need to processes two dimensions si-multaneously.

Theorem 1. CMSSG is NP-Hard and inapproximable within any factor unless P = N P .

Proof. Please refer to Appendix.
Although CMSSG has no approximation algorithm, we ob-serve that there is a chance to approximate CMSSG after introducing a small error bound in F . By slightly relaxing the constraint to ensure a clique in b G f , it becomes possi-ble to extract a group F with good similarity. Specifically, a clique is a graph with diameter as 1. We propose an al-gorithm, namely, Support Group Member Selection (SGSel) , which is a 3-approximation algorithm for CMSSG (proved in Sec. 5). SGSel returns a solution with guaranteed simi-larity  X  ( F ), while the shortest path distance of u, v  X  F in b G f may exceed 1 but is always bounded by 2 (i.e., a small error bounded). Afterwards, a post-processing procedure is proposed (detailed in Sec. 6) to tailor the solution to ensure that F is still a clique. This relax-and-tailor strategy is very effective for handling difficult NP-Hard problems. It has been widely adopted by the research community of approximation algorithms [26].

SGSel first performs a pre-processing procedure to remove redundant vertices and edges from b G , which will never appear in any feasible solution. Then, SGSel starts to process the remaining graph. Intuitively, the idea of algorithm SGSel is to target on 2-clique , instead of 1-clique. Let d b E b G the shortest path distance between vertices u, v  X  b G on a k -clique C , the shortest path between any vertices u, v  X  C path distance between any vertices in a 2-clique is bounded by 2. Compared to 1-clique (i.e., the clique with an edge connecting any two vertices), 2-clique can be acquired more efficiently (explained later). SGSel includes two steps for each vertex v in b G f = ( V, b E ): (i) 2-clique expansion from v and (ii) 2-clique trimming . For each vertex v , step (i) expands a 2-clique C v from v . We ensure that if the maximum clique K max includes v , C v must include all vertices of K max . This observation plays a crucial role in our proof of the approxi-mation ratio in the next section. Then, step (ii) examines C and iteratively removes the vertices that are inclined to share small similarity with the others. The 2-clique trimming step produces a candidate solution for C v . After every vertex v in b
G f is processed, SGSel extracts the best solution among all candidate solutions. Finally, the post processing in SGSel (detailed in Sec. 6) tailors the best solution to ensure that the returned solution satisfies the unfamiliarity requirement on the social graph.

Specifically, SGSel first performs a pre-processing proce-dure. Given b G = ( V, b E, S ), SGSel removes from V all the normal users u  X  N because the resulting group includes only the patients. Then, to satisfy the similarity constraint s , SGSel removes from V each vertex v if all of v  X  X  incident similarity edges have weights smaller than s , i.e., v is re-moved from V if w [ u, v ] &lt; s,  X  [ u, v ]  X  S . Please note that, given an instance of CMSSG, the optimal solution remains the same before and after the pre-process procedure because we only remove the vertices and edges that will not appear in any feasible solution. Afterwards, 2-clique expansion and 2-clique trimming are performed as follows. To further im-prove the efficiency of SGSel, an effective pruning strategy for each of the above two steps will be proposed in Sec. 6. 2-clique Expansion. A 2-clique C v is expanded from v by including every vertex u with ( u, v )  X  b E . Therefore, every two vertices u, t  X  C v must have d b E b G ( u, t )  X  2. If the op-timal solution includes v , C v must have all the vertices in the optimal solution. Note that finding the maximal clique K max is NP-Hard and thus computationally intensive. By contrast, C v can be generated in linear time. Moreover, if | C v | &lt; p , C v can be discarded because no group extracted from the current C v will satisfy the size constraint. There-fore, exploiting 2-clique, instead of 1-clique, is important for SGSel to process CMSSG efficiently.

To improve the processing speed of the 2-clique expansion step, let I M ( v ) denote the incident similarity of a vertex v in any subgraph M  X  b G , where I M ( v ) = find the set of 2-cliques containing different vertices, SGSel initially sorts the vertices in V according to their incident similarities. Then, it iteratively selects a vertex v  X  V with the maximum incident similarity as a reference vertex , and expands the 2-clique C v from v . 2-clique Trimming. Next, the second step iteratively re-moves the vertices with small incident similarity within each C . More specifically, let  X  i +1 denote the graph after remov-ing a vertex  X  v i from  X  i in iteration i . Initially  X  1 C , and at iteration i ,  X  i +1 represents the graph  X  i  X  X   X  v The intuition behind is that truncating the vertices with low incident similarities is more likely to increase the average sim-ilarity of the remaining subgraph. During each iteration i ,  X  v is selected as the vertex with the lowest incident similarity in  X  i , i.e.,  X  v i = arg min u  X   X  i I  X  i ( u ). Then,  X  v dent similarity edges are removed from  X  i and the remaining graph is  X  i +1 . Then,  X  i +1 is processed in the next iteration i +1. The above procedure ends until  X  i is empty. In the next section, we prove that this strategy can successfully achieve the approximation ratio.

In summary, to maximize the objective function  X  ( F ) = | F | , after a 2-clique C v is processed, SGSel extracts the we replace F AP X with  X   X  v . Then, SGSel continues to the next vertex v  X  to examine the corresponding 2-clique C v  X  til all vertices in V are examined. Finally, SGSel employs a post-processing procedure on F AP X , i.e., the best solution obtained in SGSel, to ensure that F AP X satisfies the unfamil-iarity requirement and further maximizes  X  ( F AP X ). Then, F
AP X is output as the solution. Algorithm 1 presents the pseudo code of SGSel.
 Example. Recall our running example in Fig. 2. After SGSel assigns h as the reference vertex and extracts C h = { a, f, h, i, j, k, g } , SGSel sets  X  1 as the 2-clique C the trimming step. In iteration 1,  X  v 1 is chosen as a because a incurs the minimum I  X  1 ( v ) ,  X  v  X   X  1 , i.e., I  X  1 Then, a is removed from  X  1 to produce  X  2 . Similarly,  X  v is identified with I  X  2 ( f ) = 1 . 1. Vertex f is removed from  X  to produce  X  3 . The above procedure repeats until  X  8 =  X  . SGSel then extracts  X  3 = { h, i, j, k, g } with  X  ( X  3 ) = 1 . 42, which is the maximum among all  X  i ,  X  1  X  i  X  8. F AP X is set as  X  3 . SGSel then extracts the next reference vertex, i.e., i , and continues the above iterations to check if better solutions can be obtained until all vertices in b G are examined. Finally, SGSel performs the post processing and returns the solution F AP X = { h, i, j, k, g } . Please note that  X  ( F 1 . 42, which outperforms the straightforward approach with b F = { a, b, c, d, f } and  X  ( b F ) = 0 . 36.
In the following, for each vertex v and the corresponding 2-clique C v in the 2-clique expansion step, we first prove that Algorithm 1 Support Group Member Selection (SGSel) Require: Graph b G = ( V, b E, S ), size constraint p , and simi-1: V  X  A , remove v from V if all of v  X  X  incident similarity 2: T  X  V  X  T is the set of vertices that have not been 4: while T 6 =  X  do 5: v  X  arg max u  X  T I b G ( u ), T  X  T  X  X  v } 6: let C v be the 2-clique with reference vertex v 7: if | C v | &lt; p then 8: continue; 9: let  X  1  X  C v 10: for i  X  1 to | C v | do 11:  X  v i  X  arg min u  X   X  i I  X  i ( u ) 12:  X  i +1  X   X  i  X  X   X  v i } 13: end for 14: let  X   X  v be the  X  i with maximum  X  ( X  i ) and |  X  i | X  p 15: if  X  ( X   X  v ) &gt;  X  ( F AP X ) then 17: PostProcessing( F AP X ) 18: return F AP X there exists a subgraph U  X  C v such that 3 w ( U ) is an upper bound of F OP T v , which is the optimal solution of CMSSG on only C v . Next, we prove that the average similarity  X  ( X  of  X   X  v returned from the 2-clique trimming step for v is at least 1 3  X  ( F OP T v ). Finally, after processing each vertex v  X  we prove that the proposed algorithm is a 3-approximation algorithm with guaranteed error bound to CMSSG.
 In Lemma 1, we first prove that there exists a subgraph U  X  C v , which has the property I U ( u )  X  2 3  X  ( F OP T With U , we can derive an upper bound on the total similarity of the optimal solution in C v , i.e., w ( F OP T v ). Lemma 1. There exists a subgraph U  X  C v such that I ( u )  X  2 3  X  ( F OP T v ) ,  X  u  X  U holds.
 Proof. Since F OP T v  X  C v , we prove the existence of U in C v by trimming F OP T v . Let X 1 be F OP T v . At each step j , 1  X  j  X | F OP T v | , we remove a vertex  X  v j and its incident similarity edges from X j to produce X j +1 , where  X  v j is identified as the vertex with the minimum I X j ( X  v j ) in X j . Then, there exists an X k for some k  X  [1 , | F OP T v | ] such that I  X  ( F OP T v ). We prove the above statement by contradiction. If such k does not exist, then max  X  j I X j ( X  v j ) &lt; must hold. Nevertheless, during the above procedure, the total similarity of F OP T v is removing  X  v j from X j , the corresponding incident similarity edges are also trimmed from X j . Therefore, which is a contradiction. Therefore, set U = X k  X  F OP T C v with I X k ( X  v k )  X  2 3  X  ( F OP T v ) exists, and I X  X  u  X  X k , because I X k ( X  v k )  X  I X k ( u ). The lemma follows.
The above lemma states that U 6 =  X  . We then derive an upper bound of w ( F OP T v ), i.e., 3 w ( U ) &gt; w ( F
Lemma 2. w ( F OP T v ) is upper bounded by 3 w ( U ) , i.e., 3 w ( U ) &gt; w ( F OP T v ) .
 Proof. In Lemma 1, we have w ( F OP T v ) = Let step k denote the earliest step such that the selected  X  v k satisfies I X k ( X  v k )  X  2 3  X  ( F OP T v ). Then, can be written as ing to k . For each 1  X  j  X  ( k  X  1), I X j ( X  v j ) &lt; holds because  X  v k is the first vertex selected during the steps which has I X k ( X  v k )  X  2 3  X  ( F OP T v ). Therefore, P which implies that w ( U ) = w ( X k ) &gt; 1 3 w ( F OP T follows.

In the above lemmas, we extract U from the optimal solu-tion F OP T v . The following lemma compares U and  X  i derived by the 2-clique trimming step.

Lemma 3. For each C v , if step i is the earliest step such that the extracted  X  v i from  X  i is also in U , then I  X   X  ( F OP T v ) ,  X  u  X   X  i .
 Proof. If  X  v i represents the first trimmed vertex from U , U  X   X  i holds because in each previous step j of SGSel with 1  X  j  X  ( i  X  1), no  X  v j is in U due to smaller incident similarity. Moreover, since I U ( u )  X  2 3  X  ( F OP T v ) for  X  u  X  U , I  X  ( F OP T v ). Because U  X   X  i , I  X  i ( X  v i )  X  I U ( X  v holds. In addition,  X  v i is selected due to the minimum I in  X  i . Therefore, I  X  i ( u )  X  2 3  X  ( F OP T v ),  X  u  X   X 
With I  X  i ( u )  X  2 3  X  ( F OP T v ), we derive the lower bound on optimal solution of CMSSG on b G . This indicates that SGSel is a 3-approximation algorithm. We also prove that SGSel has a guaranteed error bound.

Theorem 2. For each C v , if step i is the earliest step such that  X  v i satisfies I  X  i ( X  v i )  X  2 3  X  ( F OP T  X  ( F OP T v ) . Moreover, SGSel returns the solution F AP X
Proof. Since I  X  i ( X  v i )  X  2 3  X  ( F OP T v ), each u  X   X  satisfy I  X  i ( u )  X  2 3  X  ( F OP T v ). Recall that the average simi-|  X   X  ( F OP T v ) holds because  X  i is a candidate of  X   X  v . If |  X  then there must exist a  X  j with j &lt; i and |  X  j | = p (i.e.,  X  j is derived earlier than  X  i , and thus  X  i  X   X  j ). Therefore, | F a candidate of  X   X  v . Since  X  ( F OP T ) = max v  X  b G  X  ( F holds. This implies that  X  ( F AP X )  X   X  ( F OP T ) 3 . On the other est path distance from the reference vertex of F AP X to any other vertex is at most 1. The theorem follows.
Although the proposed SGSel algorithm can find the solu-tion in polynomial time, it still involves redundant examina-tion of the vertices and 2-cliques. In the following, we propose two pruning strategies to effectively improve the efficiency of SGSel. The first pruning strategy, namely 2-Clique Pruning , removes unnecessary 2-cliques during the 2-clique expansion step, such that not every C v needs to be expanded. For the remaining 2-cliques, the second pruning strategy, namely In-cident Similarity Pruning (ISP) , trims redundant vertices in each 2-clique to further improve the efficiency in the 2-clique trimming step.

Specifically, to improve the processing speed of the 2-clique expansion step, the 2-Clique Pruning strategy effectively re-moves redundant 2-cliques that will never generate better so-lutions. Let F AP X denote the best solution (obtained from another 2-clique) so far. If half of the maximum incident simi-larity among the vertices u in C v , i.e., (1 / 2) max u  X  C does not exceed  X  ( F AP X ), we observe that no solution in C can outperform  X  ( F AP X ), and C v can be trimmed. Proposition 1. 2-Clique Pruning. Given a 2-clique C pruned.

Proof. For any subgraph C  X   X  C v , the average similarity  X  ( C  X  ) = If tain any subgraph which has larger average similarity than  X  ( F AP X ). Therefore, C v can be pruned.

Afterward, to improve the processing speed of the 2-clique trimming step, assume that the current best solution is F with the average similarity  X  ( F AP X ). The second pruning strategy carefully examines the incident similarity of each vertex in C v to filter out unqualified vertices which will never belong to any solution better than F AP X . For any 2-clique C v with a vertex u  X  C v , since incident similarity I C v represents the contribution of u to the total similarity in C , it can be used to derive a powerful pruning strategy for SGSel. Specifically, let y =  X  ( F AP X ). Given a 2-clique C and any subgraph H  X  C v with  X  ( H )  X  y , let X  X  C v de-note the set of vertices such that the incident similarity of Then, the following lemma states that, adding any subset b X  X  X to H is not able to generate an improved solution, i.e.,  X  ( H  X  b X )  X   X  ( H ).

Lemma 4. Given any subgraph H  X  C v with  X  ( H )  X  y , a set of vertices X  X  C v with I C v ( u ) &lt; y,  X  u  X  X , for every subgraph b X  X  X ,  X  ( H  X  b X )  X   X  ( H ) always holds.
Proof. We prove this lemma by induction. We first con-sider the case when adding exactly one vertex u  X  X to H , i.e., b X = { u } . Then, the difference of the average simi-holds. Therefore,  X  ( H )  X   X  ( H  X  X  v } )  X  0, and this lemma holds when combining exactly one vertex in X with H .
Assume that the lemma holds when adding any k vertices in X to H . That is, let b X  X  X with | b X | = k and b H = ( H  X  b X ). We have  X  ( b H )  X   X  ( H ). Then, for any vertex u  X  X  X  b H , we have  X  ( b H  X  X  u } )  X  w ( b H )+ I C v  X  ( b implies w ( H )  X  | H | y , as a result,  X  ( H )  X   X  ( b H  X  X  u } )  X 
In addition to the case  X  ( H )  X  y , the following lemma further points out that, if  X  ( H ) &lt; y , ( H  X  b X ) does not need to be examined.

Lemma 5. Given any subgraph H  X  C v with  X  ( H ) &lt; y , a set of vertices X  X  C v with I C v ( u ) &lt; y,  X  u  X  X , for every subgraph b X  X  X ,  X  ( H  X  b X ) &lt; y always holds.
Proof. We prove this lemma by induction. We first con-sider the case when adding exactly one vertex u  X  X to H , i.e., b X = { u } . Then,  X  ( H  X  X  u } ) = w ( H  X  X  u } ) | H | +1 . Since  X  ( H ) &lt; y holds, w ( H ) &lt; | H | y also holds.
Assume that the lemma holds when adding any k vertices in X to H . That is, let b X  X  X with | b X | = k and b H = ( H  X  b X ). We have  X  ( b H ) &lt; y . Then, for any vertex u  X  X  X   X  ( b H  X  X  u } ) &lt; y holds. We have  X  ( b H  X  X  u } )  X  w ( b
From the above two lemmas, we conclude that given the current best solution F AP X with  X  ( F AP X ) = y and a 2-clique C v , any vertex u with I C v ( u ) &lt; y can be safely re-moved from the 2-clique C v if the size constraint is not em-ployed, i.e., p = 0. However, if p &gt; 0, more detailed cases are necessary to be examined. Specifically, let b C v denote the 2-clique after removing each vertex u with I C v ( u ) &lt; y from the original C v . Then, 1) if | b C v |  X  p , we start the 2-clique Trimming step directly from b C v , i.e., those vertices u with I C v ( u ) &lt; y are pruned from C v . 2) If | and  X  ( b C v ) &lt; y , then the whole C v can be pruned without performing 2-clique Trimming step on b C v because there will never exist a subgraph H  X  C v with  X  ( H )  X  y . 3) Finally, if | b
C v | &lt; p but  X  ( b C v )  X  y holds, it is still necessary to perform 2-clique Trimming on the original C v to find out if there is a better solution than F AP X .

Proposition 2. Incident Similarity Pruning. Given the current best solution F AP X with  X  ( F AP X ) = y and a 2-clique C v , let b C v be the 2-clique after removing each vertex u with I C v ( u ) &lt; y from the original C v . 1) If | SGSel can start 2-clique Trimming step directly on b C v . 2) If | b
C performing 2-clique Trimming step.

It is worth noting that the incident similarity of each ver-tex u in a 2-clique C v can be pre-computed before SGSel starts. Therefore, Incident Similarity Pruning can be per-formed very efficiently. Moreover, more vertices in each C are inclined to be pruned because  X  ( F AP X ) will increase as the algorithm proceeds. Moreover, as discussed above, 2-Clique Pruning and Incident Similarity Pruning only trim the 2-cliques and vertices that never generate better solutions than F AP X . Therefore, the performance bound in Theorem 2 still holds.
 Post Processing. We propose a post-processing procedure to tailor F AP X from 2-clique for meeting the unfamiliarity requirement of the MSSG. Given F AP X obtained in SGSel, we first define the violating set  X  of vertices in F AP X vertex u in F AP X is a violating vertex if there exists at least one other vertex v in F AP X such that ( u, v ) /  X  b E . The post processing includes three adjustment steps. 1) Swap: a vio-lating vertex u can be swapped with a vertex v  X  ( V \ F AP X if |  X  | is reduced and  X  ( F AP X ) does not decrease. Note that V  X  A here because the pre-processing procedure has already removed all the normal users from V . If there are many u and v satisfying the requirements, we give priority to the u and v which maximize  X  (( F AP X  X  X  u } )  X  X  v } ). 2) Expand: a vertex v  X  ( V \ F AP X ) can be added into F AP X if adding v does not increase |  X  | but increases  X  ( F AP X ). We also give priority to the v which maximizes  X  ( F AP X  X  X  v } ). 3) Shrink: given a violating vertex u  X   X , u can be safely removed if after removing u from F AP X , |  X  | decreases but  X  ( F AP X does not. Similar to 1), we give priority to the u that maxi-mizes  X  ( F AP X  X  X  u } ). Note that the above post-processing procedure minimizes the number of u, v  X  V with ( u, v ) /  X  while improving  X  ( F AP X ). Therefore, after post processing, the performance bound in Theorem 2 still holds.
To evaluate the proposed MSSG problem and SGSel algo-rithm, a user study is performed by inviting 11 professional psychiatrists (4 psychiatrists and 7 clinical psychologists) compare the support groups selected by themselves and by SGSel, respectively. Each psychiatrist and clinical psycholo-gist (psychiatrist for short) is given 5 tasks of support group formation. For each task, we randomly select 12 to 18 can-didates from a user study dataset, FB Small [2], in which we randomly hire 500 Internet and social network users, where 146 of them are ISNA patients. These patients are identified based on the standard diagnosis rules [5, 29] employed by professional psychiatrists.

Specifically, in dataset FB Small, three types of ISNAs are identified [29]: 1) Cyber-Relationship (CR) Addiction. This includes the addictions to social networking, checking and messaging to the point where social relationships to virtual and online friends become more important than real-life ones with family and friends; 2) Net Compulsion (NC). This in-cludes compulsive online social gaming or gambling; and 3) Information Overload (IO). This includes compulsive surfing of user status and news feeds, leading to lower work pro-ductivity and less social interactions with family and friends offline. Among the 146 ISNA patients, there are 41% with CR, 3% with NC, and 56% with IO. They are from California School of Professional Psychology, Taipei City Hospital, Nat X  X  Taipei Univ., Nat X  X  Yang-Ming Univ., psychiatric clinics, etc.
In addition to FB Small, we also acquire large-scale datasets from Facebook (63K nodes, and 1.5M edges), 6 Instagram (1.7M media associated to 2K users, with 9M tags, 1200M likes, and 41M comments) [15], and Douban (5M nodes and 86M edges) 7 to evaluate SGSel. Since ISNA information of each person in the above three datasets is not available, a simple approach is to randomly assign the scores in accor-dance with the distribution of 500 individuals of user study. However, ISNA distributions may not be consistent in each social network. Therefore, a machine learning approach [2] is employed to find the potential patients in the three OSNs ac-cordingly. The individuals in the datasets are classified into ISNA or normal . For each ISNA user, she is further associ-ated with three ISNA labels, i.e., Cyber-Relationship (CR) addictions, Information Overload (IO), and Net Compulsion (NC) (note that a person may belong to multiple types of ISNAs). A score in [0 , 1] is associated with each label to in-dicate the ISNA users X  severity of the specific type of ISNAs. The ratios of users with ISNAs to normal users are 0.24, 0.16, and 0.18 in Facebook, Instagram, and Douban, respectively. We evaluate the quality of the solution groups obtained by SGSel using the above three datasets. We extract the social relationships and the similarities of users, and similarity edge weights are assigned according to Sec. 3.

We compare SGSel with three algorithms, namely, Base-line, DkS, and Clique+DkS. Baseline finds the optimal so-lution of CMSSG by enumerating all the subgraphs satisfy-ing the constraints. Clique+DkS, as introduced in Sec. 3, first finds the approximated maximum clique K max [13] and then iteratively employs the weighted DkS [14] to extract the group b F with the maximum  X  ( b F ), | b F |  X  p . Moreover, DkS employs the approximated weighted DkS algorithm on b G di-rectly to obtain a group of size p . For fair comparison, before these algorithms start, we first trim the graph b G by removing normal users and the similarity edges with weights smaller than the similarity constraint s . The algorithms are imple-mented in an IBM 3650 server with Quadcore Intel X5450 3.0 GHz CPUs. Each result is averaged by 50 samples.
We first compare the solution groups returned by psychia-trists and clinical psychologists (psychiatrists for short) and http://tinyurl.com/pv52des http://tinyurl.com/lq9fjsx Figure 4: Comparisons of Different Approaches.
 SGSel with p = 7, s = 0. The result shows that, among the 55 groups formed by the psychiatrists, 32 of them are identical to SGSel X  X  choices, while 9 of them have only 1 different patient from SGSel X  X . It is worth noting that the average similarity of SGSel is 16% better than psychiatrists X  in the 9 groups. Therefore, MSSG is able to meet the patient selection crite-ria adopted by mental health psychiatrists. On average, the groups formed by psychiatrists include 27%, 4% and 69% of CR, NC, and IO addicts, respectively. The ratio of CR ad-dicts in these groups is smaller than that in the user study dataset because CR addicts are more likely to be friends with other CR addicts. Thus, it is difficult to satisfy the unfamil-iarity requirement. Fig. 3(a) presents the time spent by psychiatrists (Psych), Baseline, and SGSel to find the solu-tion groups, while Fig. 3(b) compares the solution quality among psychiatrists and SGSel. Here, Psych FeaRaio and SGSel FeaRatio denote the ratios of feasible solutions (i.e., satisfying the unfamiliarity constraint) obtained by psychi-atrists and SGSel, respectively. Similarly, Psych ObjRatio and SGSel ObjRatio indicate the ratios of the average simi-larity of the groups formed by psychiatrists and SGSel to that of the optimal solutions. As the number of candidate patients and friendships increases, it becomes more difficult for the psychiatrists to obtain the solutions. Thus, the time they spend increases, but Psych ObjRatio and Psych FeaRatio drop rapidly. By contrast, the groups formed by SGSel are all feasible solutions and their objective values are very close to the optimal solutions.

We further investigate the strategies of psychiatrists for selecting the groups. 45% psychiatrists examine the unfa-miliarity of the members first (UnFam), while the other 55% consider the similarity of the members first (Sim). As shown in Fig. 3(c), the psychiatrists who consider similarity first obtain slightly better ObjRatio but spend more time since 1) there are so many candidates for psychiatrists to extract similar ones, and 2) it is difficult to find a group with a high similarity score after considering the unfamiliarity. Psychi-atrists are inclined to iteratively adjust the group members to ensure the unfamiliarity and improve the similarity, and thus need much more time. Fig. 3(d) presents the surveyed opinions of the psychiatrists upon SGSel X  X  solutions. All the psychiatrists agree that the groups obtained by SGSel are either helpful (69%) or acceptable (31%). Moreover, as the number of candidate patients increases, more psychiatrists agree that SGSel is helpful to find a support group effectively and efficiently. We evaluate SGSel and three alternative approaches, i.e., Baseline, Clique+DkS, and DkS, using the large Instagram, Facebook, and Douban datasets. Here, Feasibility Ratio de-notes the ratio of solution feasibility (the portion of solutions which are cliques on b G f ). Objective Ratio denotes the ratio of  X  ( F ) in the solution obtained by the algorithms to that of the optimal solution.
 Group Quality. We first compare SGSel with Baseline, Clique+DkS and DkS on FB Small. Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b) compare the Feasibility and Objective Ratios of different al-gorithms, respectively. When s decreases, Feasibility Ratio of SGSel increases because in this case the post processing pro-cedure has more choices to better tailor the solution. SGSel achieves higher Objective Ratio because it extracts the so-lution F AP X with the maximum  X  ( F AP X ) among various subgraphs in different C v to strike a good balance between similarity and group sizes. In the groups obtained by SGSel, on average, the ratios of the group members with CR, NC, and IO users are 0.29, 0.07, and 0.64, respectively, differ-ent from the ratios in FB Small (i.e., 0.41, 0.03, and 0.56). The proportion of group members with CR is much smaller than that in FB Small, because each user with CR has a large number of friends in OSNs. Moreover, they usually have other users with CR as friends  X  this phenomenon has been described as loneliness propagates [9]. Therefore, SGSel selects fewer users with CR to maintain the unfamiliarity re-quirement. Users with IO usually share high similarity but have comparatively fewer online friends. Therefore, SGSel is inclined to choose more IO users to maximize the similarity of the group while fulfilling the unfamiliarity requirement.
In contrast, although Clique+DkS has high Feasibility Ra-tios in Fig. 4(a), its Objective Ratios are poor as shown in Fig. 4(b) because it only considers a small subgraph of b Moreover, Feasibility Ratios of Clique+DkS are not always 100%, especially when s becomes larger. This is because in some cases the sizes of returned maximum cliques are smaller than p . Objective Ratio of DkS is better than Clique+DkS because DkS considers the whole graph b G . However, it is worth noting that DkS has very poor Feasibility Ratio be-cause it ignores the unfamiliarity of the potential patients.
Fig. 4(c) compares Feasibility Ratios of the algorithms with different p . When p increases, Feasibility Ratios drop because larger groups are difficult to obtain, and the possibil-ity that at least one member violates the unfamiliarity con-straint increases. We also evaluate SGSel on large datasets, i.e., Facebook, Douban, and Instagram in Fig. 4(d). Fig. 4(d) manifests that the sizes of the returned groups grow when s decreases especially in Douban which is a social ap-plication for people with the same interests to share informa-tion, because the friendship relation in Douban plays a less important role as compared to other social applications, such as Faebook. Therefore, Douban contains many large densely connected components in b G f .
 Running Time. To evaluate the scalability of SGSel, Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) compare the execution time of SGSel and other approaches in Douban (5M vertices). Baseline is not included because it takes more than one day to find a solution. SGSel is able to obtain solutions mostly within 5 minutes. The exe-cution time is smaller when s increases because more vertices with low incident similarities are effectively removed in this case. Similarly, when p increases, the execution time also drops because more unnecessary 2-cliques (with sizes smaller than p .) are skipped by SGSel.

Fig. 5(c) compares the pruning strategies proposed in this paper in Douban. Both SGSel with only Incident Similarity Pruning (Only ISP) and SGSel with only 2-Clique Pruning (Only 2-CP) outperform SGSel without pruning (NoPrun-ing) because the pruning strategies effectively remove redun-dant vertices and 2-cliques. Only ISP performs better than Only 2-CP because the pruning condition of 2-CP is more difficult to satisfy, even though 2-CP can prune the whole 2-clique at once. When s increases, the power of the prun-ing strategies drops because the edges in the similarity graph are of larger weights, and the conditions of either pruning strategies are thus more difficult to satisfy.

Fig. 5(d) further compares the execution time reduction by employing either pruning strategies in the three real datasets. The variance of the vertices X  incident similarities is the largest in Douban, i.e., there are many dense and sparse components in the similarity graph. Therefore, the pruning strategies perform better because they effectively remove a larger num-ber of vertices and 2-cliques with small incident similarities (i.e., sparse components). In contrast, the variance of in-cident similarities is the smallest in FB because FB has a large number of CR and IO addicts, who are usually similar to each other. In this case, the incident similarities of these vertices are usually high. Therefore, the pruning strategies can only prune a smaller number of vertices and 2-cliques in FB. Finally, Fig. 5(e) compares the execution time of differ-ent approaches in FB Small. The execution time of Baseline grows exponentially as s decreases because Baseline needs to consider more cases when s is small. By contrast, the exe-cution time of SGSel is tiny because the 2-cliques and the pruning strategies effectively trim the search space.
With the emergence of online support groups, this paper aims to address the need of mental health professionals and formulates a new problem, namely, Member Selection for Online Support Group (MSSG). MSSG is to find a support group that maximizes the similarity of the symptoms of all selected members, while ensuring that any two members are unacquainted to each other. We prove that MSSG is NP-Hard and inapproximable within any factor. Moreover, we develop a 3-approximation algorithm, namely SGSel, with a guaranteed error bound. A user study on psychiatrists and clinical psychologists manifests that the proposed algorithm is helpful for them and can find better solutions. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that our algorithm out-performs the other baselines in terms of both quality and efficiency.

Theorem 1. CMSSG is NP-Hard and inapproximable within any factor unless P = N P .

Proof. We prove this theorem with the reduction from the maximum clique problem. Decision problem of maximum clique, given a graph G c = ( V c , E c ), decides from the graph if there exists a clique of size no smaller than q , i.e., a complete graph with at least q vertices and with an edge connecting every two vertices. In the input graph of CMSSG, i.e., b G = ( V, b E, S ), let A = V = V c (all individuals are with ISNAs), b E = E c , and p = q . The similarity edge set S and the corresponding edge weights are set arbitrarily. CMSSG finds a feasible solution F of size no smaller than p if and only if the maximum clique problem returns TRUE, i.e., there is a clique of size at least q . Therefore, CMSSG is NP-Hard.
Note that CMSSG returns  X  ( F ) = 0 if F =  X  , i.e., no feasible solution exists for CMSSG. Given the instance of CM SSG ( b G, p, s ) mentioned above, the solution of CMSSG, i.e., F , is a clique with size no smaller than p . Therefore, if CMSSG has a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with an arbitrarily large ratio  X  &lt;  X  , then the following statements hold: 1) the algorithm finds a feasible solution for CMSSG if the maximum clique returns TRUE, and 2) any CMSSG instance with the algorithm returning a feasible solution implies that the corresponding instance in maximum clique is TRUE. In other words, the  X  -approximation algo-rithm can solve the maximum clique problem in polynomial time, implying that P = N P , which is widely deemed in-correct. Therefore, CMSSG has no polynomial-time approx-imation algorithm, i.e., CMSSG is inapproximable within any factor unless P = N P .
