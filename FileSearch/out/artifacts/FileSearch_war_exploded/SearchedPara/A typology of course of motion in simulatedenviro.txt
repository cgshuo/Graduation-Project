 REGULAR PAPER Corina Sas  X  Nikita Schmidt Abstract This paper proposes a novel method of analysing trajectories followed by people while they perform navigational tasks. The results indicate that mod-elling trajectories with B  X  ezier curves provides a basis for the diagnosis of naviga-tional patterns. The method offers five indicators: goodness of fit, average curva-ture, number of inflexion points, lengths of straight line segments, and area cov-ered. Study results, obtained in a virtual environment show that these indicators carry important information about user performance, specifically spatial knowl-edge acquisition.

In particular, it focuses on how individuals perform naive search tasks within indoor Virtual Environments (VEs). The basis for the analysis of users X  spatial behaviour is their movement paths as recorded within the VE. One possible direction to ex-plore the geometric features characterising these trajectories consists of comparing users X  movement paths with some prototypical curves [ 51]. Such a methodology enables trajectory modelling which offers a twofold benefit. Most importantly, it provides indicators for describing the trajectories in a quantitative way. This can be considered as a basis for comparing and contrasting different types of trajec-tories and eventually describing a trajectory typology. Such a methodology also offers an alternative visualisation method to the traditional one of trajectory plots, whose additional strengths consist of the visual appeal of the smooth interpolation. and retrieval of trajectories in such domains as spatial databases, GIS, and video retrieval [ 10, 15, 16]. The focus is primarily on the development of distance func-tions and shape signatures for two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) trajectory data [ 18]. They support trajectory matching, aggregation and compari-son [ 40], finding similar trajectories, shape-based querying [ 35] etc. The subject area of these developments is vastly different from human navigation, where tra-jectory analysis is a largely unexplored research topic.
 spatial behaviour. B  X  ezier curves have been successfully applied to robot naviga-tion [ 6, 29], and avatar navigation in VEs [ 12, 17, 48]. However, applying these curves for modelling trajectories followed by users within a simulated, and possi-bly a physical environment is a novel approach and represents a methodological contribution of this work.
 knowledge aquisition followed by a section introducing B  X  ezier curves, together with the concept of curvature. The subsequent section focuses on the study design, including detailed descriptions of apparatus, sample and study procedure. This is followed by the methodology section, which outlines the rationale of choosing B  X  ezier curves as a basis for modelling trajectories. The next section presents study results, described along the three primary indicators which this methodology pro-vides: goodness of fit, curvature and inflexion points. The paper also reports on the findings related to two other indicators that can deepen our understanding for discriminating efficient and inefficient navigational behaviour. They are related to the length of straight line segments within a trajectory and the area covered by the users during navigation. Finally, the impact of study findings on modelling spatial cognition is discussed. 2 Background Spatial behaviour is a complex human activity which pervades people X  X  daily lives to such an extent that it is usually taken for granted. It is mostly in unfamiliar environments that people become aware of the efforts required to perform envi-ronmental spatial learning, particularly when they experience the uncomfortable situation of becoming disoriented. The difficulties of environmental learning have been associated both with the complexity of spatial settings [ 7, 21, 46] and with the individual differences in spatial skills and navigational strategies [ 26, 51, 62 , 63]. development of cognitive maps [ 55, 59]. The study of navigation in the area of HCI has developed mostly in the field of cognitive modelling, benefiting from inputs provided by both environmental psychology [ 49] and geography [ 36]. At-tempts to understand spatial behaviour in both real and artificial worlds were pri-marily concerned with highlighting the symbolic representation of spatial knowl-edge [ 42 ]. work carried out by Piaget and Inhelder [ 49] which led to a theory of the develop-ment of the concept of space. They were the first to acknowledge the importance of moving in space and experiencing with objects, through coordination and inter-nalisation of actions, for the development of early spatial representations. Piaget and Inhelder [ 49] showed that the child X  X  initial understanding of space is topo-logical whereas the Euclidean spatial relationships are understood later [ 32]. one of the most widely accepted models designed to explain the adults X  acquisition of spatial knowledge, in the form of a developmental sequence.
 environment, such as objects or places, identified and remembered because of their features: distinctiveness, location, personal significance assigned to them etc. Landmarks are conceptually and perceptually distinct locations [ 28]usedasaba-sis for judgements about different aspects of the spatial layout [ 54]. They could mark a decision point and become relevant in wayfinding. One of the most impor-tant roles played by landmarks is that of symbolising anchor points for organising the information within the spatial layout [ 23].
 formation about possible spatial and temporal connections between specific envi-ronmental features, connections which represent route knowledge [ 4]. Golledge [23 ] defined route knowledge as the procedural knowledge required to navigate along a route or path between landmarks or distant locations. Integration and in-ferences are the key concepts which distinguish landmark and route phases from the survey phase. In any of the initial two phases, one can integrate or make infer-ences from the discrete information about the basic knowledge units: landmarks for the first stage and routes for the second one. Initially, the information char-acterising route knowledge holds only topological features (ordered locations of landmarks along a route), but lacks metric information between these landmarks. The development of route knowledge leads to an increased amount of information about the relationships between the landmarks on a route, in terms of the order of landmarks, approximate distance between them or length of the entire route. knowledge of general relations, which defines survey knowledge. Survey repre-sentations often show a hierarchical structure [ 60]. Survey knowledge represents the highest level of spatial knowledge, a map-like mental encoding which inte-grates both landmarks and route knowledge. Reaching this level enables an indi-vidual to make inferences about both landmarks and routes, based on a thorough understanding of the interrelationships between them. Only survey knowledge en-ables an organism to plan different routes on paths not yet travelled [ 65]orto locate objects within a general frame of reference [ 39].
 quisition received amendments for its simplistic view. Alternatively, Montello [ 41 ] proposed five stages. The first one consists of a mixture of landmarks and route knowledge (including metric knowledge) which increases in quantity, accuracy and completeness during the second stage. The third stage, which assumes the in-tegration of discrete places into a hierarchical structure, represents a qualitatively different level. The fourth stage acknowledges the role of individual differences in spatial knowledge acquisition, while the last one emphasises the role of spatial language for topological knowledge, which exists independently of metric spatial knowledge.
 place, Lynch [ 36] identified a set of elements which describe the skeleton of a city: paths, edges, districts, nodes and landmarks. Paths are familiar major or mi-nor routes used for travelling, such as streets, railroads, walkways etc. District or neighbourhood represents an area which can be recognised as distinct on the basis of its internal homogeneity. Edges are boundaries dividing districts, while landmarks are external points of reference, such as physical objects which act as orientation aids. Nodes are strategic points, such as important crossroads, which differ from landmarks in their function: nodes are points of activity rather than physical objects.

Studies have suggested that spa-tial tasks as opposed to psychometric tests offer a better prediction of environ-mental learning or spatial knowledge acquisition [ 41]. Therefore, we identified users X  spatial skills, e.g. high versus low spatial users, through a spatial perfor-mance task. This was followed by comparing the performance indicators com-puted for trajectories covered by the two groups of users. Study findings suggest that this analysis allows the successful discrimination between these two groups of users.

Attempts to model motion trajectory led to a large range of algo-rithms, usually employing curves [ 3, 34, 43]. B  X  ezier curves have been successfully applied to motion planning algorithms for robot navigation [ 6, 29] or automatic animation of virtual characters within VE [ 12, 17, 48 ].

The properties of these curves and the problem of numerical instability are also discussed. 3B  X  ezier curves AB  X  ezier curve is a polynomial defined by a set of control points .Thefirstand the last point are called endpoints . This type of curve was developed by Pierre B  X  ezier three decades ago for improving the shape design of Renault cars. Nowa-days B  X  ezier curves have a large applicability in computer graphics [ 30]andin particular in the Adobe PostScript drawing model [ 1].
 roles played by these points, in terms of location and shape of the curve. The end-points anchor the ends of the curve, while the control points determine the actual shape of the curve, acting like magnets that pull the curve. Therefore, given these two types of points, a B  X  ezier curve passes through the endpoints and is tangent to the first and last sides of the open polygon defined by its points [ 37]. cubic polynomial equations. It is defined by four points: two endpoints P 0 ( x 0 , y 0 ) , P ( x The parametric equation of a B  X  ezier curve of order n is given by: where t is the parameter of the curve ( 0  X  t  X  1 ) and P k are constant vectors asso-ciated with control points (including the endpoints). C k n are binomial coefficients: The number of points determining a B  X  ezier curve defines the degree of the associ-ated polynomial. 3.0.1 Properties of B  X  ezier curves The properties of B  X  ezier curves are summarised below [ 8]: 1.

Differentiating property: The curve is indefinitely differentiable. 3.1 Curvature Curvature is a mathematical concept, which measures the bending properties of a curve. A linear segment of a curve has a curvature zero, while the sharper the curve bends, the higher the curvature is. Thus, through its numerical values for each of the trajectory points, curvature enables an intuitive description of the shape of the curve.

 is as follows [ 24]: B  X  ezier curves, is the concept of numerical instability. Numerical instability is usu-ally detected when a numerical scheme stops to behave like the analytic solution, and is due to the imprecision of floating point arithmetic, rounding errors or grow-ing solutions outside the range of values, which can be handled by the computer [31 ]. 4 Study design The experiment has been carried out within a desktop VE [ 44], which permitted the recording of users X  positions and headings at each moment in time. Adopting a physical world metaphor, the VE consists of a virtual multi-storey building where each level contains three rooms, such as lobby (Fig. 2), library (Fig. 3), conference room, training room etc. The rooms have adjacent walls and are connected through doors, offering an intuitive navigational model. acquire a complete view, the user has to move and rotate. However, once the user is in a particular room, less effort is usually required to explore it fully. Users can navigate by means of moving forwards, backwards or rotating, through the use of directional keys. Every time the user presses the up-arrow or down-arrow keys, he/she performs a forward or backward translation. The user moves in a discrete mode, with a constant distance per translation. The height of the view point is the standard height of 1.70 virtual metre, while the viewing angle through which the user perceives the virtual world is 70  X  . Users use the mouse only for selecting a new floor on the panel located in the virtual lift.

Since the purpose was to investigate how people explore, search, and acquire spatial information about an indoor environment, this feature of the system has been particularly exploited. The importance of unrestricted movements for investigating spatial behaviour has been previously emphasised by Darken and Banker [ 20].

Volunteers were paid for their participation. iment by a rich set of virtual sensors. This was complemented by an odometer and a rotational event listener [ 22 , 44]. The data captured when the user interacts with the VE contains details of navigation paths along the temporal dimension and about the rotational behaviour performed by the users. Thus, more than 200 trajectories were recorded with an average of 160 events per trajectory (rotations and translations).
 measurement. Initially, users were allowed to become accustomed with the VE and to learn movement control. After this, they were asked to perform an exploration task. The exploration task within the virtual building lasted for approximately 25 min. After the completion of this task, during which participants acquired spatial knowledge related to the VE, they were tested. Users were placed on the third level and asked to find a particular room (namely, the library) located on the ground floor of the virtual building. The time needed to accomplish this task acted as an indicator of the level of spatial knowledge acquired within the VE: the shorter the search time, the better the spatial knowledge.
 as low spatial users , when they needed significantly longer time to find the library (mean = 49 s), or high spatial users who found the room straight away (mean = 7 s). Two examples of trajectories followed by low spatial users are presented in Figs. 4 and 5, while Figs. 6 and 7 present two examples of trajectories followed by high spatial users. Trajectories covered during the exploration phase are shown as two-dimensional representations of the movement paths confined to a single floor (as opposed to three dimensional representations which would account for the entire building). Therefore, given the distinct spatial layout of each floor, these figures offer fragments of trajectories as they occur separately for each floor. spatial knowledge and skills is grounded on findings suggesting that traditional psychometric paper-and-pencil tests for assessing small-scale spatial abilities are not predictive of environmental learning [ 5, 62, 63]. They can usually account for only 5% of the variance in the ability to learn large-scale environments [ 27]. Usually, the latter has been rather investigated through people X  X  performance on spatial tasks in buildings, campuses or cities [ 38 ]. This method of investigating spatial skills, in the particular context of a VE, has been employed in this study. tions regarding the differences between them, in terms of trajectory  X  X moothness X , numbers of turns and degree of turning angles. We conjecture that these features can constitute a basis for discriminating trajectories followed by high spatial users from those followed by low spatial users.
 be employed in order to formally describe these features. The analysis presented in this paper aims to provide such indicators related to trajectory properties. For this, trajectory paths have been analysed by fitting them with a specific family of curves. This technique would offer a comprehensive, quantified and statistically grounded understanding of the aspects differentiating inefficient trajectories from efficient ones. 5 Methodology The following considerations were taken into account to choose the type of curve used for trajectory analysis in our study. Firstly, user paths were recorded as se-quences of points, represented by their coordinates. Thus, the curve had to be built on a sequence of control points of arbitrary length. Secondly, one of the quanti-tative indicators employed (curvature) required C 2 -smoothness (continuity of the second derivative).
 control points, and approximation , which does not necessarily do so [ 9]. Approx-imation curves allow us to use the goodness of fit indicator, which is not possi-ble with interpolation, where the fit is always perfect. Besides, interpolation with high-order polynomials is known to introduce superfluous inflexion points, which would make our inflexion points indicator less reliable. Thus, interpolations were excluded from further consideration.
 In addition to reducing the degree, B-splines also have the local control property, whereby changing a single control point only affects its neighbourhood, but not the entire curve (as it is with B  X  ezier). However, neither of these properties was important for our study. We chose B  X  ezier curves as they are mathematically sim-pler and easier to analyse. Besides, use of B-splines would have introduced an extra variable: the degree of the polynomials. However, a similar study can also be conducted with B-splines. In fact, our research can be considered as a start-ing point, since B-splines whose degree equals the number of control points, are exactly B  X  ezier curves.
 mon feature. The trajectory is usually generated by a set of cubic B  X  ezier curves smoothly joined, which pass through a set of points previously extracted [ 52]. For the endpoints selected according to some criteria, the algorithms compute the B  X  ezier control points in between [ 6].
 entire set of points describing the original trajectory, we try to fit a B  X  ezier curve and then perform an analysis of efficient and inefficient navigational behaviour, employing the quantitative measurement obtained from the curve approximation. Therefore we did not use cubic B  X  ezier, but B  X  ezier of high order, where the order is dictated by the number of locations in the original trajectory.

In order to prevent and identify whether this problem occurred in the case of our B  X  ezier curves, the following measures have been taken: 1. Data normalisation: All the coordinates were normalised to the range (  X  1 , 1 ) . 2. Using two B  X  ezier representations: In an attempt to duplicate the B  X  ezier repre-3.

The average number of different positions in each trajectory is 71. The shortest trajectory is presented by 29 different locations while the longest one is presented by 125. The motion analysis involved comparison between the two groups of users (high versus low spatial users) with respect to the properties of the B  X  ezier curves employed for modelling the trajectories. Previously identified indicators such as goodness of fit, curvature and inflexion points are discussed in the following subsections. 6.1 Goodness of fit Goodness of fit offers a quantitative way to assess how well a statistical model fits a set of data. Its measures capture the difference between the observed values and the values expected under the model in question. In our case, goodness of fit was assessed by computing the residuals, namely the shortest distances from by a precomputed set of points, 20 points for each original trajectory point. The shortest distance is not necessarily the global minimum, since for each point from the trajectory, we are searching for its  X  X orrespondent X  point of the curve (Fig. 8). minimum of the distance from each trajectory point to the curve. For each point, the algorithm starts where it stopped at the previous trajectory point.
 value of 0.055 and a standard deviation of 0.049. The t -test performed on the residuals obtained by the two groups of trajectories shows significant differences ( t ( 1330 ) = 5 . 02 , p &lt; 0 . 001). The average distance from the original trajectory points to the generated B  X  ezier curve is significantly smaller for efficient trajecto-ries (mean = 0 . 047) than for inefficient ones (mean = 0 . 061). Because the B  X  ezier curve can be seen as a  X  X moothening X  of the original trajectory, this finding sup-ports the hypothesis that efficient trajectories are significantly smoother than inef-ficient ones (i.e. less noisy).
 B  X  ezier curves, which have been generated for each of them. For illustration, two of these trajectories have been chosen among the inefficient ones (Figs. 9 and 11 ), while the other two among the efficient ones (Figs. 10 and 12 ). For the inefficient trajectories, which are visibly rough, chaotic and noisy, their B  X  ezier curves also do not look very smooth and do not fit them very well. At the same time, it can be seen that B  X  ezier curves fit efficient trajectories much better, thus suggesting the face validity of our modelling. 6.2 Curvature Curvature is another characteristic whose computation was made possible through B  X  ezier curve modelling. Intuitively, the curvature of user trajectories can be inter-esting to study, but is theoretically impossible to compute directly on discrete time series data, since curvature is only defined for doubly differentiable curves. Any tool that computes curvature of a discrete set of points does so by approximating or modelling this set with such a curve. In our case, since we primarily study the usefulness of B  X  ezier curve modelling to provide a variety of indicators, this model was a natural and consistent choice for curvature computation.
 curves, namely 20 B  X  ezier points for one original trajectory point. Curvature values ranged between  X  473346 and 7253.518. After removing the outliers and extreme values which represented about 15% of the processed data set, the remaining cur-vature values lie within the range  X  10 to 10.
 inefficient trajectories is higher (mean = 3 . 61) than for those generated for effi-cient trajectories (mean = 3 . 25) ( t ( 24488 . 21 ) = 9 . 45 , p &lt; 0 . 001). comparing their distributions. The B  X  ezier curves approximating efficient trajecto-ries present significantly more curvature values within the ranges (  X  7,  X  6) and (  X  4,  X  1). The B  X  ezier curves approximating inefficient trajectories present signifi-cantly more curvature values within the ranges (  X  1, 1) and (2, 8) and as mentioned above for the values smaller than  X  10 and greater than 10.
 values for the two groups of users. Since the extremes are omitted, the values are within the range (  X  9 , 10 ) . As it is shown, the high curvature values characterising inefficient trajectories have higher frequency than the ones for efficient trajecto-ries, except the curvature values close to zero. In other words, users employing efficient strategies perform much smaller rotations than the users who did not de-velop such strategies. The latter rotate more often at greater angles.
 with noise, e.g. small zigzags, while large curvature values reflect sharp bends along the trajectories.
 cient trajectories to contain more curvature values with negative sign, as opposed to inefficient trajectories which can be better characterised by curvature values of positive sign. A positive curvature value indicates a turn to the left, while a negative curvature value indicates a turn to the right. In other words, efficient tra-jectories contain more turns to the right, while inefficient trajectories contain more turns to the left.
 cient trajectories present significantly higher positive curvature values (mean = 0 . 001. At the same time, significantly more outliers, or curvature values higher than 10 or smaller than  X  10, belong to inefficient trajectories, namely more than 60% of the negative outliers and more than 73% of the positive outliers (continu-ity correction  X ( 1 ) = 72 . 93 , p &lt; 0 . 001). The analysis concerning the sign of the curvature is continued in the following subsection, dedicated to inflexion points. 6.3 Inflexion points The number of inflexion points, where the curvature sign changes, offers another indicator which differentiates between high and low spatial users X  trajectories. Findings show that trajectories followed by inefficient navigators contain a sig-nificantly higher percentage of inflexion points ( t ( 17 ) = 2 . 96 , p &lt; 0 . 01) than efficient trajectories. In other words, efficient trajectories are characterised by a higher level of constant curvature sign.
 trajectories contain a higher percentage of points where the curve turns to the left, while efficient trajectories contain a higher percent of points where the curve could be related to the  X  X eft to right X  perceptual organisation, rooted in the western convention of reading.
 est and possibly supporting further differentiation between efficient and inefficient trajectories. They are related to the percentage of straight lines within a trajectory and to the area covered by the users during navigation. The results have been ob-tained by analysing the raw data and not the points generated by the B  X  ezier curves. 6.4 Straight line segments The length of each straight line segment was measured along each trajectory. A t -test indicated significant differences with respect to the average length of the straight line segments between efficient and inefficient trajectories ( t ( 17 ) = 2 . 096 , p &lt; 0 . 05). The average length of the straight line segments along efficient trajectories is significantly smaller (mean = 0 . 18) than the same measurement for the inefficient trajectories (mean = 0 . 27).
 low spatial users X  trajectories regarding the trajectory length. Given this result, we become interested in determining whether the same relationship holds with respect to the area covered by high and low spatial users. 6.5 Area covered For each motion trajectory, we consider the area of the convex hull of the points on the path (Fig. 14 ). Findings indicate that area covered by the efficient navigators is significantly larger than the area covered by inefficient ones ( t ( 17 ) = 2 . 96 , p &lt; 0 . 01). In other words, high spatial users cover a significantly greater area than low spatial users. 7 Discussion Study findings validate the hypotheses regarding the differences between the two groups of trajectories identified on the basis of users X  performance. To summarise, trajectories followed by low spatial users present significantly more noise, being less smooth than trajectories followed by high spatial users. Inefficient trajectories are also characterised by more turns at sharp angles and more changes of direction. These findings shed light into the quality of spatial knowledge acquired by users in a VE through linking users X  performance with their overt spatial behaviour. the search task ( t ( 30 ) = 2 . 10 , p &lt; 0 . 05). The same holds true for gender, with male participants outperforming females ( t ( 30 ) = 2 . 06 , p &lt; 0 . 05). These out-comes align with Waller X  X  findings, which suggest a confounding effect of spatial skills, proficiency with the interface and gender on spatial task performance [ 62]. navigation performance. These are the minimum energy principle and the spatial orientation. High spatial users surpass low spatial ones in both aspects. strategic rules, which enable users to achieve the goals with a minimum invest-ment of resources, both temporal and cognitive [ 64]. Since efficient trajectories are defined by smaller absolute curvature values, they are closer to minimal en-ergy curves than inefficient trajectories. In a similar vein, the better goodness of fit of efficient trajectories with respect to the associated B  X  ezier curves, suggests the reduction of needless expenditure of energy.
 orientation refers to users X  knowledge of position and orientation within the VE [13 ]. High spatial users succeeded in maintaining a better spatial orientation. Their navigational behaviour seems to be governed by a simple set of rules. They usu-ally maintain the same main direction or steady orientation, only smoothly altered through small turns. These high spatial users avoid large changes of direction. turns of high curvatures. They change their direction not only more often but also more drastically, with serious negative impact on their spatial orientation. In other words, their frequent changes of direction increase the risk of disorientation. 8 Conclusions This paper does not argue that B  X  ezier curves are the only curves which can provide a good approximation of trajectories. It does argue however, that B  X  ezier curves are a suitable methodology for trajectory modelling, as suggested by study re-sults. One the other hand, given the local control property, lower degree B-splines could prove more appropriate for modelling trajectories in real time, rather than post factum, as they don X  X  cause the entire curve to change when a new point is added. This may be particularly useful in tracking and security applications and is a topic of further research. We expect our results to be largely transferable to B-splines, since they are mathematically similar to piecewise B  X  ezier curves of the same degree.
 (where n is the number of points) for computing a single point on the curve. Com-puting a property along the entire curve at fixed intervals is therefore of O ( n 2 ) complexity, which is generally acceptable for most applications. In our experi-ments, processing time was negligible. For very long trajectories where it may become an issue, capping the curve degree at k (using either piecewise B  X  ezier or B-splines) may be advisable, resulting in the effectively linear O ( kn ) complexity. This is, however, beyond the scope of this work.
 place, any spatial task used for the purpose of assessing performance in spatial learning raises the issue of task dependency on the spatial layout, e.g. complexity of the environment. itation is through developing and employing standardised tests for assessing en-vironmental spatial abilities. Such tests would require users to carry out spatial tasks whose performance can subsequently be used to successfully predict spatial performance in environmental learning. Some pioneer work in this direction has been done by Hegarty and Waller [ 63 ] who designed WALKABOUT, a VE-based test that simulates navigation through a physical environment and can be used to assess spatial learning without requiring all its users to attend a particular loca-tion. This test is a unique attempt to fill the gap in understanding and assessing the cognitive components that are used in acquiring spatial knowledge of large-scale environments.
 and the limited study sample, we cannot claim generality of study findings over any type of VE. At the most, these outcomes can provide suggestions of how trajectories in indoor cluttered VEs can be modelled using classic curves, while testing the validity of our findings requires replication.
 formed within VE, study findings have a significant potential for practical applica-tions. Differentiating between efficient and inefficient navigational behaviour and their underlying strategies could be exploited through applications dedicated to improving spatial skills, such as adaptive VEs. How exactly these findings can be used for designing adaptive VEs, for supporting low spatial users to improve their navigational strategies or challenging the skills of high spatial users, is a direction which requires further investigation.
 with the original trajectory data form multi-attribute motion data which can be further analysed with machine learning techniques. Li et al. [ 33]showedhow multi-attribute motion data can be classified and recognised using singular value decomposition (SVD), support vector machines (SVM) and dynamic time warping (DTW). It would be interesting to look into combining the two research results, i.e. investigating how well their approach works with our indicators and trajectory data as input.
 transfer of results to other types of simulated environments, and to real envi-ronments where users are tracked with location sensing systems such as GPS, Ubisense, sensor networks and/or RFIDs. Analysing spatial behaviour of users alongside other modes of interaction (such as using buttons, knobs, voice etc.) with devices in a location-tracking environment can provide novel insights into research on pervasive and ubiquitous computing.
