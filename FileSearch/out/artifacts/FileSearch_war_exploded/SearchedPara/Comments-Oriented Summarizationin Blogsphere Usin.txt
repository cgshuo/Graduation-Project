 Most studies of summarization focused o n plain text and a variety of methods have been proposed to summarize a single document or multiple documents. The increasing availability of online information, especially the mushroom of user generated content (UGC), puts forward a new challenge in the area of automatic text summarization.

Comments-oriented blog summarization is a specific task in social summariza-tion which considers not only the content of a blog entry but also the comments from the readers. Hu et al. [1] defined comments-oriented blog summarization and proposed an algorithm to select summa ry sentences containing representa-tive words from comments. In [2], authors first exploited three relations contained in comments to score comments. Yang [8] proposed a model to capture both the informativeness of sentences and interes ts of social users. Authors in [7] proposed a summarization framework to summarize the differences in microblog. Hu et al. [3] proposed to improve online news summarization. Our work is also related to sentence similarity measure. [4] propo sed an algorithm that takes into account both semantic information and word order information of sentences. Quan et al. [6] proposed a method to compute short text similarity based on the common terms and the relationship of the distinguishing terms of two short text snippets. The relationship of distinguishing terms are captured by their probabilities on topics which are extracted by Gibbs sampling.

In this study, we make full use of the UGC to generate the comments-oriented summary. Our method refines sentence similarity between sentences in a blog entry by combining preliminary sentence similarity with the similarity relation between a sentence and a comment. We define the similarity refinement process from an optimization perspective and utilize an iteration method proposed in [5] to solve the optimization problem. We conduct the experiments on a real-world data set, and the results prove the effectiveness of our proposed similarity measure according to the comparison between our two-stage similarity measure and traditional methods.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The similarity computing is discussedinSection2.Theexperimentsa nd results are represented in Section 3 and finally we conclude this paper in Section 4. 2.1 Stage 1: Preliminary Similarity Standard cosine similarity and topic based similarity are explored as the pre-liminary measure in this stage. But we focus on topic based similarity because standard cosine similarity has been well known. In this study we directly apply the similarity measure proposed in [6] to ca pture the topic-level relation between sentences. We derive a set of probabilistic topics T = { t 1 ,t 2 , ..., t z } on a blog entry. Aiming to exploit the influence of non-co-occurring terms on sentence sim-ilarity, we only take into consideration the distinguishing words of two sentences and the distinguishing term set is defined as: After obtaining the novel topic based vectors, we use the cosine method to compute the similarity between sentences. 2.2 Stage 2: Refined Similarity In order to refine the similarity between sentences using the preliminary similar-ity value, we first define three types of similarity in the blogsphere : similarity between sentences in blog entries ( SS ), similarity between sentences in com-ments ( CC ) and similarity between sentences in blog entries and sentences in comments ( SC ).
After defining these similarity relations, we refine the similarity from an op-timization perspective and the objective formula is defined below: min where ss  X  i,j denotes the preliminary similarity weight between sentence i and j in ablogentry, sc i,j is the SC relation between sentence i and comment j ,and cc i,j represents the CC relation between comment i and j . In addition, the first part of Formula (2) aims to ensure the refine d similarity between sentences remain close to the preliminary similarity while the second part tries to minimize the dissimilarity between sentences in the blog entry and sentences in the comments. We use the balance parameter 0 &lt; X &lt; 1 to control the tradeoff between the two parts. It is worthy noting that if  X  = 1, then the solution is the preliminary similarity itself.

However, solving the optimization problem shown in Formula (2) is time-consuming. In [5], an iteration method has been proposed and we apply it in this study directly. Specifically, we use W SS to denote the similarity between sentences in a blog entry and W CC to denote the similarity between sentences in comments. W SC is used to denote the cross-graph similarity, which is between sentences in a blog entry and its comments. Then the refined similarity can be computed as the following iterative method: where W ( t ) SS denotes the similarity between sentences in t th iteration and W T SC is the transposition of W SC . W  X  SS and W  X  CC are the SS and CC preliminary similarity, respectively. In the experimental study, we apply the data used in [2]. We have totally imple-mented four different systems in our experiments. All the four summarization systems are compared on RO UGE measures and a brief description is introduced as follows.

Standard + LexPR (System 1): This system applies standard cosine similarity in LexPageRank to generate the summary.
 Topic + LexPR (System 2): In this system, topic based similarity is used in LexPageRank model.

Two-stage Standard + LexPR (System 3): This system utilizes our two-stage similarity measure by using standard cosine similarity as the preliminary simi-larity.

Two-stage Topic + LexPR (System 4): Our two-stage similarity measure is adopted in this system and the preliminary similarity is topic based similarity.
Table 1 shows the comparison results on ROUGE measures. It can be seen that System 4 outperforms all the other three systems on different evaluation measures and the results indicate the e ffectiveness of the proposed two-stage similarity measure. This comparison also indicates that topic based similarity can effectively capture the relation o f sentences in similarity measure. In this paper, we propose a summarization model which applies a novel sen-tence similarity measure. A two-stage algorithm is constructed to refine the sentence similarity between sentences with UGC information. The experiment results show that our method achieves better performance compared with tra-ditional methods.
