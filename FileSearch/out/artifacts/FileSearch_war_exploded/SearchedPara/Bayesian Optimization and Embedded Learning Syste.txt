 An important property of embedded learning systems is the ever-changing environment they create for all algorithms operating i n the system. Optimizing the performance of those algorithms becomes a perpetual on-line activity rather than a one-off task . I will review some of these challenges in autonomous vehicles. I will discuss Bayesian optimization methods and their applicatio n in robotics and scientific applications, focusing on scaling up the dimensionality and managing multi-fidelity evaluations. I will finish with lessons learned and thoughts on future directions a s these methods move int o embedded systems. Bayesian Systems; Autonomous Vehicles; Robotics Dr. Jeff Schneider is the engineering lead for machine learning at Uber's Advanced Technologies Center. He is currently on leave from Carnegie Mellon University where he is a research professo r in the school of computer science. He has 20 years experience developing, publishing, and applying machine learning algorithm s in government, science, and industry.. He has over 100 publications and regularly gives talks and tutorials on the subject. Previously, Jeff was the co-founder and CEO of Schenley Park Research, a company dedicated to bringing machine learning to industry. Later, he developed a machine learning based CNS drug discovery system and commerc ialized it during two years as Psychogenics' Chief Informatics Officer. Through his research, commercial, and consulting efforts, he has worked with dozens o f companies and government a gencies around the world.
