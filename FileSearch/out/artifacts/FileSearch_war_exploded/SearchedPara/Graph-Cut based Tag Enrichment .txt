 In this paper, a graph cut based tag enrichment approach is proposed. We build a graph for each image with its initial tags. The graph is with two terminals. Nodes of the graph are full connected with each other. Min-cut/max-flow algorithm is utilized to find the relevant tags for the image. Experiments on Flickr dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed graph-cut based tag enrichment approach.

In recent years, social networks (e.g. Picasa, Flickr, YouTube) are very popular for people to share their photos. With the rapid advance in the technology of di gital imaging, there is an explosive growth in the amount of available image data in social media sharing networks. Social me dia repositories allow users to upload their personal media data and provide several descriptive keywords for their metadata. The descriptive keywords are called tags [1]. Tag is one of the most important textual information on social media networks. They made the social networks are easy to management and better accessible to the users. Image tags have certain consistent with its visual content. Thus tag based image retrieval is very popular and practical in the searching engines such as Flickr. However, due to the noise, imprecise and incompleteness of user labeled ta gs, the performance of tag based application is inevitably influenced by the tag quality. 
Extensive research has been dedicated to the tag enrichment for social images. Liu et al. [1] propos ed to rank the original tags of the images using random walk m odel by taking both the textual and visual similarities of tags into account. The random walk model promotes the tag with many close neighbors and weakens the tags with fewer neighbors. Li et al propose a neighbor voting algorithm for tag relevance learning [2]. This approach is based on the fact that different users label visually similar images using the same tags. The relevance of a tag with respect to an image can be inferred from tags of visual si milar images. In this paper, we view the tag enrichment as a co mbinational optimization problem. And graph-cut is utilized to find relevant tag list for the image. where d ( p , q ) is the distance of tag p and q . In this paper we utilize Google distance is to measure the distance of two tags [1]. In Eq.(1), E data ( L ) measures the cost of the assignments of the tags relevant/irrelevant to the image. The cost is expressed as follows where () S  X  measure the score of a the tag  X  to the image and initial tags list  X  . () S  X  comes from the tag to tag similarity and the tag to image similarity W  X   X  is the similarity of the tag  X  to the initial tags  X  . And (, ) I WI  X  measures the similarity of tag  X  to the image I . where  X   X  denote the image set that contains tag  X  , the image number in this set is ||  X   X  . 2  X  is set to be the median value of all the pair wise Euclidean distances between images [1]. F I and F x are the visual features of images I and x . Correspondingly, we utilize Min-cut/Max-flow algorithm to find the relevant tags for each image [3]. 
In this Section, we evaluate our approach on social images that are collected from Flickr. We select 25 queries, including alcedoatthis , apple , beach , bear , butterfly , cherry , deer , eagle , forest , highway , jeep , lavender , lotus , orange , peacock , rose , sailship , sea , sky , strawberry , sun , sunflower , tiger , tower , and zebra , then perform tag-based imag e search with  X  X anking by interestingness X  option. The top 5000 returned images for each query are collected together with their associated information, including tags, uploading time, user id entifier, etc. In this way, we obtain a social image collecti on consisting of 52,418 images. 
For each image, we extract 470-dimensional features, including 225-dimensional block-wise colo r moment features generated from 5-by-5 fixed partition of the image, 170-dimensional hierarchical wavelet packet featur es [4], and 75-dimensional edge distribution histogram features. 
We use NDCG as the performan ce evaluation measure [1]. 500 images are randomly selected from our Flickr set for labeling by five persons. For each image, each of its tags is labeled as one of the five levels: Most Relevant (score 5), Relevant (score 4), Partially Relevant (score 3), Weakly Relevant (score 2), and Irrelevant (score 1). After computing the NDCG measures of each image X  X  tag list, we can average them to obtain an overall performance evaluation of the tag enrichment method. 
The NDCG scores of initial tags (denoted INIT), tag enrichment results of random walk (denoted RANK [1]), and graph cut based approach (denot ed Graph) under NDCG depths 1, 5, 10 and 20 (denoted @1, @5, @10 and @20) are shown in Fig.2 respectively. The improvement of our approach over RANK, and INIT are 3.1% and 11.3% respectively under @5.
