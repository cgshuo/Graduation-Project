 1. Context
A patron approaches an information retrieval service, and asks their first question requesting informa-tion ( Eichman, 1978 terms this the opening question in a reference service encounter) to begin an informa-tion seeking journey, and may subsequently ask more questions. Yoon and Nilan (1999, p. 871) define information seeking (IS) as  X  X  X  dynamic process of a user making sense that involves cognitive behavior at the level of individual perception and an associated communicative behavior at the level of the social context when insight is sought via linguistic means from other sources. X  X  The patron  X  s consequent request for information X  X licitation during retrieval interaction, as distinct from his/her first search question brought to the information retrieval service X  X s termed micro-level information seeking (MLIS). An elici-itation is linguistic in form, with communicative intention, and is to be understood and interpreted at the complex semantic and pragmatic levels. Wu (1993a) suggests that a request for information, whether or not it is externally motivated, may voluntarily reveal one  X  s interests, concerns, perplexity, problems, authority, social power, etc. Thus, it is suggested to be a useful resource for dynamic user modeling.

In the past, the patron  X  s search questions have been considered static, and therefore it was assumed that the intermediary with better elicitation capability would perform better to solicit better representation of the patron  X  s information need (e.g., Bunge, 1984 ). However, researchers (e.g., Belkin, Brooks, &amp; Daniels, 1987 ) suggest a dynamic user modeling based on the assumption that the patron  X  s information need is not static but dynamic, changing during the course of the information retrieval interaction whether with a human or a machine interface. Other research into interactive information retrieval models also supports this dynamic assumption (e.g., Ingwersen, 1996 ; Saracevic, Spink, &amp; Wu, 1997 ; Spink, 1993 ; Wu, 1993a ).
Robins (2000) review of the four interactive information retrieval models: Saracevic  X  s stratified model, Bel-kin  X  s episodic model, Spink  X  s relevance feedback model, and Ingwersen  X  s global model of polyrepresenta-tion, also suggests the dynamic phenomena. Yet, successful dynamic interaction depends on listening and understanding, particularly a patron  X  s MLIS which expands the intermediary  X  s knowledge of the pa-tron  X  s cognitive state as well as his/her affective mode dynamically.

In her research, Wu (1999) found that the intermediary tends to ignore the patron  X  s elicitations during IR interaction. For example, a patron asks questions intended to clarify his information need regarding his re-information seeking. It might be helpful if the intermediary portrayed the patron  X  s elicitation, the MLIS, properly. The following research questions are salient research issues to highlight patron MLIS behavior: (1) What are the features of patron MLIS behavior? (2) Do the patron and the intermediary differ in elicitation behavior in terms of frequency of occurrence? (3) Does patron elicitation behavior relate to individual variables, such as gender, age, status, knowledge, 2. Related research
Research regarding patrons and their information seeking is long standing. For example, Eichman (1978) analyzes the patron  X  s opening questions in the reference interview, Auster and Lawton (1984) and
White (1998) study the relationship between online search interview/reference interview and user satisfac-kin et al., 1987 ; Price, 1983 ) explore dialogue structure and episodic models of information retrieval. Allen (1997) , and Allen and Kim (2001) study information need and information seeking at the aspects of person and context, Ellis et al. (2002) examine user X  X ntermediary interaction, Kuhlthau (1993) studies the individ-ual  X  s information seeking process, Solomon (1997) considers information seeking conversations, and Yoon and Nilan (1999) study the patron  X  s certainty and uncertainty in information seeking. Recently, more re-search attention has been focused on the elicitation behavior of patrons and intermediaries (e.g., Nahl &amp;
Tenopir, 1996 ; Saracevic et al., 1997 ; Spink, Goodrum, Robins, &amp; Wu, 1996 ; Spink, Goodrum, &amp; Robins, 1998 ; Wu, 1993a ; Wu, 1999 ; Wu &amp; Liu, 2003 ).

In this study, the term  X  X  X licitation X  X  is used instead of a  X  X  X uestion. X  X  The term  X  X  X licitation X  X  is well and clearly defined, while  X  X  X uestion X  X  has many connotations. For example, in the linguistic literature, the cri-teria of syntactic form, discourse function, or an obligatory verbal response have been applied to the term  X  X  X uestion X  X , yet it remains ill-defined (e.g., Kearsley, 1976 ; Tsui, 1994 ; Wu, 1993b ). Questions are charac-terized in the LIS literature as patrons  X  search statements ( Saracevic, 1978 ), reference questions (e.g. Eich-man, 1978 ), and intermediaries  X  open, neutral, and closed questions ( Dervin &amp; Dewdney, 1986 ; King, 1972 ;
Lynch, 1978 ), etc. In this study, an utterance is identified as an elicitation primarily based on its embodying a request for information, even without an integrative grammatical form ( Wu, 1993a ).

Elicitation is a complex phenomenon. As it is linguistic in form, the syntactic, the semantic and the pragmatic way it is expressed, the grammatical forms, and (3) the communicative intention of the elicitation. 3. Methods
The source of the data set is the online information retrieval interviews collected by the research project initiated by Tefko Saracevic at the School of Communication, Information, and Library Studies (SCILS), Rutgers University, entitled Nature and Improvement of Librarian X  X ser Interaction and Online Searchin gfor
Information Delivery in Libraries ( Saracevic &amp; Su, 1989 ). In this research the interviews were transcribed, the elicitations of both patrons and intermediaries were defined and identified, and patrons  X  elicitation pur-poses were analyzed and categorized. The method of discourse analysis was applied to identify utterance units and elicitations. Content analysis was used to specify patron elicitation purposes. These preliminary findings were then analyzed statistically to test the significant relationships between patron elicitation behavior and the individual and the contextual variables. Saracevic and Su  X  s data set meets the needs of with genuine patrons and requests; (2) well designed pre-and post-search questionnaires as well as post-search interviews providing legitimate sources for further analysis. That is, patrons  X  demographic data as well as their information needs are captured in the pre-search questionnaires, and the post-search question-naires and interviews cover both patrons  X  and intermediaries  X  evaluations of the interaction process and pa-trons  X  evaluation of the retrieval. Sections 3.1 X 3.6 describe the research processes. 3.1. The corpus and definition
The corpus was transcribed following the transcription rules defined by the researcher: the line number was assigned, the unit of utterance was defined, identified and numbered, and the pre-search and search stages were specified. A unit of utterance is a speech sequence by one participant. It terminates when the other talks. The stages of interaction are defined as pre-search and search, which are separated by the moment the intermediary hits the keyboard X  X he interaction with the third party. The length of interaction is defined in terms of the actual time spent and the total number of utterances contributed in an interaction.
In total 38 interactions were analyzed. 3.2. Unit of analysis X  X he utterance
An utterance is defined as a speech sequence uttered by one participant during the conversation. In terms of its syntactic structure, an utterance can be as long as several sentences, or as short as subject-predicate structures, lexical or elliptical phrases, clauses, or even false starts with incomplete thoughts, including words like  X  X  X h X  X  and  X  X  X h huh X  X . If a participant tries to interrupt, whether successfully or not, the other participant  X  s talk is broken into two utterance units and numbered separately. For example, 1. I: okay um what happen online is that we say select search for (.) Index 2. P: [oh good okay. that  X  s [helpful] 3. I: [uh hum] that  X  s just the term 1. I: Okay and it  X  s specifically for this [this protein 2. P: [for this protein 3. I: for this protein only? aequorin? (Q029)
If a participant does not intend to take the floor, but gives some continuing signals for attentiveness and counted as a unit. And the other participant  X  s speech is segmented into utterance units by these back-chan-nels. The following excerpt serves as an example. 1. I: okay we got the intersect now we  X  ll see where those two intersect and see how much is there 2. P: okay 3. I: then because we have two big ones at that point 4. P: yeah 5. I: we  X  ll see what  X  s in there 6. P: uh hum 7. I: and if if there  X  s a high enough number (Q015) 3.3. Identifyin gelicitations
An elicitation is a verbal expression of a question. Generally speaking, an elicitation can be an interrog-ative in grammatical terms. But rhetorical questions to which no answer is expected or required are not considered elicitation in this study. On the other hand, an imperative that demands linguistic responses rather than overt action or behavior, such as  X  X  X ou can tell me what it is, X  X  is considered an elicitation.
In conversation, incomplete utterances or elliptical utterances are very often used to elicit responses, for example,  X  X  X nd that goes to X  X  X  (Q002);  X  X  X nd it will go to X  X  X  (Q004). Such cases are termed  X  X  X lternatives X  X  or  X  X  X ndirect questions X  X  ( Dillon, 1990 ) in contrast to formal grammatical question forms, such as intonated questions, wh -questions or auxiliary questions. In this study, an elicitation takes the following forms; an example and the case number follow:  X  indirect/alternative ( X  X  X ell, let X  X  make a decision X  X  Q002)  X  intonated ( X  X  X ook at another five? X  X  Q003)  X  wh-questions ( X  X  X hat what are you doing X  X  Q004)  X  auxiliary ( X  X  X an I ask one more question? X  X  Q024) 3.4. Determinin gelicitation purposes
The categorization of patron elicitation purposes then followed, in which the elicitations are signified from the interaction dialogue. The categorization process applied content analysis and developed a data-driven taxonomy of patron elicitation purposes. Two phases are involved. In the first phase, notes are taken during the pilot study, and a tentative scheme of categories is derived from the field notes on patron elic-itation utterances from five of the encounters. In the second phase X  X he coding process X  X he scope of some categories is redefined. For instance,  X  X  X utput expectation X  X  and  X  X  X utput evaluation X  X  are combined as  X  X  X ut-puts X  X  because patron elicitations regarding output expectation are only represented by a few instances. The products of the categorization required many refinements which took place during the iterative and inter-active processes of categorization and coding. 3.5. Groupin gpatron elicitation behavior
Grouping of patron elicitation behavior allows further investigation of its relationship with the related contextual variables. Cluster Analysis, a statistical calculation based on a matrix of either distance or sim-ilarity between pairs of cases (SAS, Statistical Analysis for Science) is applied to form the clusters. Based on the criteria that (1) the number of groups should be as small as possible; and (2) the number of cases in each group should be comparable, two clusters, namely active-and non-active elicitation groups, are generated.
Using frequency distribution, high-and low-frequency elicitation groups are also available for triangulation purposes. 3.6. Contextual variables
The term  X  X  X ontextual variables X  X  here denotes two sources of variables: individual variables and situational variables. Individual variables include the patron  X  s status, gender, age, and online search expe-rience, as obtained from the questionnaires. Situational variables in this case include length of encounter and the individual intermediary. The individual variables are illustrated with attributes and numbers in parentheses: patron status (faculty/professional 10; student 28); age group (21 X 30 15; 31 X 40 11; 41 and above 12); gender (female 25; male 13); online search experience (no online experience 18; once 8; twice or more 12). 3.7. Statistical analysis
A number of statistical analyses are applied. Descriptive statistics are applied to display patron and intermediary elicitation frequency and length of interaction. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coef-ficients are applied to determine the relationship between the length of interaction (in terms of actual time and number of utterances) and the number of patron and intermediary elicitations in the pre-search and search stages, and in the interview as a whole. The Chi-squared test is applied to determine whether patron elicitation behavior in terms of high-vs. low-frequency questioners and active vs. non-active questioners is related to the contextual variables, including some individual and some situational variables.
 4. Results 4.1. Elicitation frequency and length of interaction
A corpus of 38 interactions was analyzed. The data set contained approximately 43h of videotaped inter-actions, including 35h of online connection time with an estimated 18,500 patron and intermediary utter-ances. 852 patrons  X  and 861 intermediaries  X  elicitations were identified, with an average of three patron elicitations and nine intermediary elicitations per interaction in the pre-search stage, and 19 patron elicita-tions and 14 intermediary elicitations in the search stage ( Table 1 ).

The following phenomena were observed in terms of the differences between patron and intermediary elicitation frequency in the two stages. In the pre-search stage, intermediaries asked significantly more ques-tions than patrons. Patron elicitations accounted for only one quarter, while intermediaries contributed the other three quarters (26% vs. 74%). In the search stage, however, patrons contributed slightly more elici-tations than intermediaries (59% vs. 41%). However, patrons asked fewer questions during the pre-search stage (only 6% of the total), and dramatically more (43%) during the search stage. Intermediaries, on the other hand, asked approximately one fifth (20% of the total patron and intermediary elicitations in an en-tire encounter) during the pre-search stage, and approximately one third during the search stage (31%). Pa-trons and intermediaries asked approximately the same percentage of questions across the pre-search and search stages as a whole (49% vs. 51%).
 The average length of each encounter was approximately 1.1h (68min) in terms of the actual time spent.
The average length of the pre-search vs. search stages was 13min vs. 55min (approximately 20% vs. 80% of the total length). The length of the interactions was varied and widely spread: the shortest was 32min and the longest 120min. Furthermore, the range of actual time of the pre-search stage varied from 4min to 52mins with an SD of 8.8, while in the search stage it was between 2 0and 96min.

Instead of the actual time spent,  X  X  X nteraction length X  X , referring to the number of utterances exchanged, better portrays the length of interaction, in that it indicates the interactive features of the encounter, and ignores monologues by one party. The mean number of utterances for all 38 cases is 489. In the pre-search stage, it is 128, about one fourth of the total count in the encounters ( Table 2 ). The search stage accounted for the remaining three quarters (361 utterances exchanged, 74% of the total count in the encounters). The actual time and the number of utterances exchanged display a similarity in terms of the percentages distrib-uted between the pre-search and the search stages.

Overall, the average occurrence of utterances per minute is 7.2 (489 utterances divided by 68min). In the pre-search stage, 9.8 utterances occurred per minute. In the search stage, the number is 6.5 utterances per minute. The fact that fewer utterances per minute took place during the search stage does not mean that less interaction took place. It can be accounted for by the phenomenon that the intermediary and the patron were both interacting with a third party, the computer.

A significant relationship was found between length of interaction (both actual time and number of utterances exchanged) and patron elicitation frequency in both the pre-search and search stages. However, intermediary elicitation frequency did not show any such relationship. Table 3 presents Pearson Product
Moment Correlation Coefficients between the length of interaction (in terms of actual time and number of utterances) and the number of patron and intermediary elicitations in the pre-search and search stages, and the encounter as a whole. The data reveal a statistically significant difference between patron and inter-mediary elicitation behaviors. This phenomenon suggests that patron elicitations increase when the length (particularly the number of utterances exchanged) expands. Intermediary elicitations, on the contrary, do not expand with the length of interaction.
 4.2. Patron elicitation purposes
Based on a tentative scheme, categories of patron elicitation purposes and their scopes were modified and redefined during the coding process. A scheme with ten categories was finally documented based on the total 852 patron elicitations. Fig. 1 summarizes the categories of patron elicitation purposes and their definitions.

The coding of patron elicitation purposes in terms of counts in ten individual categories was accom-plished. Table 4 ranks the ten categories according to the frequency of occurrences in the pre-search stage, in the search stage, and in an encounter as a whole.

Of the total 852 patron elicitations, the first three categories ( X  X  X utputs X  X ,  X  X  X erms X  X , and  X  X  X earch proce-dures X  X ) accounted for 582 occurrences, 68.3% of the total. Patrons also asked questions about the  X  X  X mme-diate plan X  X  and  X  X  X atabases X  X , accounting for about 17% of total elicitations. Of 36  X  X  X ocial X  X  questions, nine regarded the meta-project of the interaction study.  X  X  X ther online issues X  X ,  X  X  X ther information services X  X , and  X  X  X choic questions X  X  provided about 10% of total elicitations.

In the different stages, patrons  X  major concerns shifted in terms of the questions they asked. In the pre-search stage,  X  X  X erms X  X  alone accounted for 52.2% of all elicitation purposes, while in the search stage, pa-trons  X  perplexity spread, that is, Outputs, Search procedures, and Terms together accounted for 67.4%.
In the pre-search stage, the first-ranked category is  X  X  X erms X  X , which accounts for 52.2% of all elicitation purposes. Two other categories X  X  X  X earch procedures X  X  and  X  X  X atabases X  X  X  X ccount for another 25%. In other words, in the pre-search stage, the three most significant patron elicitation purposes are  X  X  X erms X  X ,  X  X  X earch procedures X  X , and  X  X  X atabases X  X .

A total of 739 patron elicitations are identified in the search stage, of which 207 (or 28%) regarded  X  X  X ut-puts X  X . That is, approximately one in every four patron elicitations related to  X  X  X utputs X  X . This, together with the second-ranked category X  X  X  X earch procedure X  X  X  X ccounts for half of the total count (49.4%). The third-ranked category X  X  X  X erms X  X  X  X ccounts for approximately one fifth (18%) of all patron elicitations in the search stage. These first three categories, together with the fourth-and fifth-ranked categories X  X  X  X mmedi-ate plan X  X  and  X  X  X atabase X  X  X  X ccount for 85% of total patron elicitations in the search stage. The remaining five categories X  X  X  X ther online issues X  X ,  X  X  X ther information services X  X ,  X  X  X ocial questions X  X ,  X  X  X choic ques-tions X  X , and  X  X  X ndiscernible or incomplete questions X  X  X  X ccount for only 15% of patron elicitations in the search stage.

The data suggest that patron elicitation purposes are distributed differently in the pre-search stage and search stage in terms of  X  X  X erms X  X  and  X  X  X utputs X  X  (52.2% vs. 6.2% in the pre-search stage and 18.0% vs. 28.0% in the search stage).  X  X  X earch procedure, X  X   X  X  X mmediate plan, X  X   X  X  X ther online issues X  X  and  X  X  X ther infor-mation services X  X  are the categories that patrons ask about more often in the search stage than in the pre-search stage.

Table 5 ranks the ten categories of patron elicitation purposes according to the number of patrons who engaged in these categories. The data show that of the 38 patrons, 34 asked about  X  X  X earch procedure X  X , 33 asked about  X  X  X erms X  X , and 31 asked about  X  X  X utputs X  X .  X  X  X atabase X  X  and  X  X  X mmediate plan X  X  ranked fourth and fifth. In other words, more than half of the 38 patrons  X  concerns were about Search procedure, Terms,
Outputs, Databases, and intermediaries  X  Immediate plan. An interesting future research question will be which patrons do not ask the questions that most ask. 4.3. Patron elicitation behavior and contextual variables
Patron elicitation behavior is operationalized and grouped by calculating the elicitation frequency and elicitation purposes at the search stage. Two groups are identified based on frequency and on the results of SAS cluster analysis .
 4.3.1. High-vs. low-frequency questioning patrons
Patrons are grouped into high-frequency (H-freq) and low-frequency (L-freq) groups according to the frequency of elicitations. The mean frequency for the total 38 patrons in the search stage is 19. The L-Freq group ranges in frequency from 1 to 19, and the H-Freq group from 2 0to 97. Table 6 displays the number of cases in each group. 4.3.2. Active vs. non-active questioners A five-group clustering is determined from an SAS (Statistical Analysis for Science) Cluster Analysis
Program output. Table 7 displays the group and grand means of the ten categories of patron elicitation purposes. Noted that in Group 1 (G1), the means of all ten categories, except categories  X  X  X  X  X  ( X  X  X ther online issues X  X ) and  X  X  X  X  X  ( X  X  X ther information services X  X ), are lower than the grand means. Table 8 further presents the mean elicitation frequency and the associated encounters in the five groups. In Table 8 , G1 has the smallest amount of patron elicitation, only 8.50. In addition, it has much smaller group means than the grand means for each of the ten categories (except for category  X  X  X  X  X  .95 vs. .76), suggesting that it should be labeled as a group of  X  X  X on-actively questioning patrons X  X . G2 has larger group means than the grand ever, these five categories all have a very low frequency, no more than 29). Since G3, G4, and G5 each carry only one to three subjects, and since their group means are also larger than the grand means, they are com-bined with G2 as  X  X  X ctively questioning patrons X  X . 4.3.3. Patron elicitation behavior and contextual variables
Tables 9 X 14 demonstrate the significant results of Chi-squared tests of the contextual variables, patron status, age, and online experience with high-vs. low-frequency questioning patrons, and active vs. non-active questioners. 4.3.3.1. Patron status. Among ten faculty members, three fall into the L-freq group while seven fall into the H-freq group. Of the 28 students, 19 are in the L-freq group, with only nine students in the H-freq group patron status shows a statistically significant difference according to patrons  X  elicitation frequency. Faculty members ask more questions in the information retrieval situation than students do.

Table 10 shows that more student patrons fall into the  X  X  X on-actively X  X  questioning group than the  X  X  X c-tive X  X  group (17 vs. 11). Faculty members and professionals fall mostly into the  X  X  X ctively X  X  questioning group rather than the  X  X  X on-active X  X  group (7 vs. 3). The significance level associates with .05 &lt; p &lt; .1. 4.3.3.2. Age. Table 11 suggests that the age of the patron also has an impact on the frequency of elicitation.
Of the group with ages between 21 and 30, 13 fall into the L-freq group, and only two into the H-freq group. The group aged 41 and above demonstrates a reverse effect: only four of the 12 are in the L-freq group while eight are in the H-freq group. The Chi-squared value equals 8.76 with a significance level .01 &lt; p &lt; .02.

Table 12 suggests that patron age is likely to associate with the  X  X  X on-active X  X  and  X  X  X ctive X  X  questioner status. Of the group aged 21 X 30, 11 of 15 fall into the  X  X  X on-active X  X  group. The age group 31 X 40 does not differ in terms of  X  X  X ctive X  X  and  X  X  X on-active X  X  groups. As for the age group 41 and above, more patrons fall into the  X  X  X ctive X  X  than the  X  X  X on-active X  X  group (8 vs. 4). The significance level equals .10. 4.3.3.3. Online search experience. Patrons  X  level of online search experience also has a significant impact on patron elicitation frequency. Fourteen of 18 patrons with no online experience fall into the L-freq group, with only four in the H-freq group ( Table 13 ). On the other hand, nine of 12 patrons who have had two or more online experiences fall into the H-freq group, with only three in the L-freq group. Those patrons who have had only one online experience are not significantly different from either the L-freq or the H-freq groups. Overall, the Chi-squared score equals 8.31 which associates with a significant level .01 &lt; p &lt; .02.
Table 14 suggests that online search experience is likely to have an impact on patron elicitation behavior in terms of the  X  X  X on-active X  X  and the  X  X  X ctive X  X  questioners. Twelve of the 18 patrons with no online search experiences fall into the  X  X  X on-actively X  X  questioning group. On the other hand, nine of the 12 patrons with two or more online experiences fall into the  X  X  X ctively X  X  questioning group. The result ( p = .066) is close to the significance level ( p &lt; .05) with two out of six (33.3%) cells of expected frequency &lt; 5.
To sum up, the individual difference variables, such as status, age, and online search experience, have significant impact on patron elicitation frequency in terms of high-vs. low-frequency questioning patrons.
As for the  X  X  X ctively X  X  and  X  X  X on-actively X  X  questioning patrons, the three individual variables (patrons  X  sta-tus, age and online search experience), are also found to be likely to have an impact on them although the significance level falls to .05 &lt; p &lt; .1. This finding is very similar to the H-freq and L-freq groups.
Although the individual intermediaries show significant differences on patron elicitation frequency, due to over 50% insufficient values of expected frequency in the cells, no conclusive result can be claimed. The gender of patrons and of intermediaries, as well as their gender pairings, all display a significance level of .05 &lt; p &lt; .12. This suggests that the gender issue may be a factor demanding more empirical exploration.
No other variables, however, are found to have significant impact on actively and non-actively questioning patrons. 5. Summary and discussion 5.1. Patron elicitation is situational while intermediary elicitation is pre-planned
Elicitation is one of the major communication modes spreading along the interaction. The proportion of distribution has a similar proportion to the length of interaction, that is 20% vs. 80% of the actual time spent, and 26% vs. 74% of the number of utterances exchanged in the pre-search vs. search stage. The phe-nomenon strongly suggests that interpersonal communication, the exchange of utterances and the number of questions in the situation of information retrieval are indeed related to the length of interaction.
Patron elicitation behavior is situational, intermediary elicitation is not: Patron elicitation frequency is found to have a significant correlation coefficient with the length in minutes and the number of utterances exchanged. This can be interpreted as indicating that patron elicitation behavior is situational, and expands when the length of interaction expands.

Intermediaries  X  elicitation behavior shows more signs of being pre-planned: Intermediary elicitation fre-quency does not exhibit any significant correlation coefficient with the length of interaction. Furthermore, the intermediary is found to ask more questions than the patron in the pre-search stage, whereas the patron asks slightly more questions than the intermediary in the search stage. Thus, intermediary elicitation behav-ior can be interpreted as being more pre-planned, and not affected by the length of interaction. Price (1983) , who conducted a study on seven pre-search interactions, also reported that intermediaries ask many more questions than patrons. It is also possible that intermediaries performed user modeling functions through direct questioning mostly in the pre-search stage. 5.2. Patrons  X  perplexity is assignment-related
Patrons  X  main concerns revealed through their elicitations are  X  X  X earch-assignment X  X  related; this supports the previous related studies. For example, in the pre-search stage, patron elicitations mostly regard  X  X  X erms X  X  (52%). Together with questions regarding  X  X  X earch procedures X  X , this accounts for 68.1% of the total frequency. In the search stage, three categories X  X  X  X utputs X  X  (28.0%),  X  X  X earch procedures X  X , (21.4%), and  X  X  X erms X  X  (18.0%) occurred most frequently, accounting for 67.4% of the total frequency of occurrence.
The fact that more than two-thirds of patron elicitations in an encounter concern  X  X  X utputs X  X ,  X  X  X erms X  X , and  X  X  X earch Procedures X  X  suggests that patrons  X  main concern in an information retrieval interaction is  X  X  X earch-assignment X  X  related. That is, the patrons  X  main concerns represented by the above categories correspond to the functional classification of  X  X  X nformation interaction functions/tasks X  X  identified by Belkin et al. (1987) and  X  X  X ognitive activities X  X  specified by Saracevic, Mokros, and Su (1990) . Fig. 2 compares the three classi-fication schemes.

Belkin et al.  X  s classification of information interaction functions/tasks analyzes utterances of both pa-trons and intermediaries in great detail and determines the functions and tasks required for a system (including an intermediary and a database) to achieve the goal of information interaction ( Belkin et al., 1987 ). Saracevic et al. (1990) also examined utterances of both patrons and intermediaries, but emphasized the kind of cognitive activities occurring in the retrieval interaction. Belkin  X  s UM (User Modeling), PS (Problem State), and PD (Problem Description) are similar to Saracevic  X  s  X  X  X ontext X  X  which is the patron  X  s  X  X  X roblem at hand; information, if any, collected so far; expectations, and other aspects underlying the ques-structure. Belkin  X  s RS (Retrieval Strategy) includes  X  X  X atabases X  X  as one subfunction for  X  X  X atabase selec-tion X  X ; however, in patron elicitations or Saracevic  X  s cognitive activities,  X  X  X atabases X  X  refers to questions about or explanation of the content or coverage of databases. Although Saracevic  X  s  X  X  X ction X  X  (explanation of what is happening) and Belkin  X  s  X  X  X xplanation X  X  correspond to the  X  X  X mmediate/current action or plan X  X  of the present study, it is essential to emphasize that such explanation is in response to the patron  X  s request rather than system-initiated reporting. Generally speaking, patrons  X  concerns regarding  X  X  X erms X  X ,  X  X  X earch procedures X  X , and  X  X  X utput X  X , as well as  X  X  X atabases X  X ,  X  X  X nline system X  X , and  X  X  X mmediate/current plan or ac-parallels (identified from the functional aspect, the cognitive aspect or from patrons  X  elicitations) and the shift in patron elicitation purposes support Belkin  X  s suggestion that the information retrieval dialogue is collaborative and goal-oriented with a structure of foci-flow ( Belkin et al., 1987 ).

Patrons  X  perplexity and affective need other than  X  X  X earch-related assignment X  X : Although the majority of patron elicitations are search-at-hand related, such as  X  X  X erms X  X ,  X  X  X atabases X  X ,  X  X  X earch procedures X  X , or  X  X  X utputs X  X , other concerns are also reflected by some categories. For example, in the search stage,  X  X  X mmediate/current plan or action X  X  ranked fourth with 10% of the total elicitation frequency, after  X  X  X ut-puts X  X ,  X  X  X earch procedures X  X  and  X  X  X erms X  X . This phenomenon can be interpreted as an indication that pa-trons have a need to reduce uncertainty in the retrieval situation. In the pre-search stage,  X  X  X ocial X  X  questions ranked fourth, after  X  X  X erms X  X ,  X  X  X earch procedures X  X , and  X  X  X atabases X  X . This suggests that pa-trons have an affective need to establish an interpersonal relationship at the beginning of an interaction.
The patrons  X  third additional concern relates to their overall search problem: they ask questions regarding  X  X  X ther information services X  X  to satisfy the overall goal of the search problem. In other words, in addition to goal-oriented  X  X  X earch-statement X  X  related elicitations, the particular categories of patrons  X  information needs during the interaction process fall into the three areas: (1) the need to solve relevant information problems X  X he  X  X  X elated information services X  X , (2) their perplexity regarding what is going on or what can be expected X  X  X  X urrent/immediate plan or action X  X , and (3) personal relationship or politeness X  X ocial questions.

Focus shifts during the interaction: Patrons  X  information needs change, as reflected in the shift of their elicitation purposes during the progress of the interaction. In the pre-search stage, patrons are concerned questions. These phenomena explain that patrons  X  information need in the pre-search stage is to straighten out their search questions by verifying the terms or related concepts. Patrons also have the affective need to establish a relationship with intermediaries. In the search stage, patrons  X  main concern shifted to  X  X  X ut-puts X  X , and their uncertainty is revealed by asking questions regarding  X  X  X mmediate/current action or plan X  X  of the intermediary or system. These phenomena can be interpreted as indicating that in the search stage, patrons  X  foci are on the products; in the meantime, their affective need is shown by the intention to reduce their perplexity regarding the environment.

The IR system is still not so easy to use:  X  X  X earch procedure X  X  shows up as a consistent concern of patrons across the two stages. This concern may due to the system being difficult to understand, or to people gen-erally lacking the kind of knowledge required. Belkin et al. (1987) commented that people usually are not interested in learning the functions of the system; besides, they do not have the obligation to be familiar with these issues. 5.3. Patron elicitation behavior related to the contextual variables
Active questioners are also high-frequency questioners. Theoretically, since the categories  X  X  X erms X  X ,  X  X  X earch procedures X  X , and  X  X  X utputs X  X  contribute the most to the total frequency (498 out of 739) of patron elicitations, the results of grouping the patrons either by frequency or by cluster analysis of the categories should be very similar. That is,  X  X  X ctive X  X  questioners are very likely to be high-frequency questioners. Con-sequently, the empirical findings of the relationship between patron elicitation behavior and contextual variables using both approaches reveal similar results in terms of the related variables for both the raw data and the normalized data tests.
 Status, age, and online experience count as significant variables related to patron elicitation behavior.
Individual intermediaries, patron gender and the gender pair of the intermediary and the patron do not reveal significant difference.

Interestingly enough, status and age show no impact on patron elicitation behavior when patron elici-tations are normalized by interaction length. A further investigation of the relationship between age, status, and interaction length showed that age and interaction length are significantly correlated ( F = 4.26 with a tus are also correlated, that when patron elicitation is normalized by interaction length, age and status also lose their impact. This phenomenon suggests an intertwined relationship between individual difference vari-ables (e.g., status and age) and the situational factor (e.g., interaction length). In other words, older, higher status people will speak more and longer, but the relative frequency of elicitations remains the same.
No social power issue is related in the IR situation:  X  X  X ne who is higher in the formal social status asks more questions, X  X  is a phenomenon observed in the literature (e.g., Dillon, 1990 ). For example, Dillon  X  s empirical data reveal that teachers ask more questions than pupils, and doctors ask more questions than patients. Three individual difference variables X  X atrons  X  status, age group, and online search experi-ence X  X ere found in this study to have an impact on patron elicitation behavior in terms of elicitation fre-quency and cluster analysis of the categories. That is, faculty members (vs. the student patrons) are likely to be high-frequency or  X  X  X ctively X  X  questioning patrons. However, once the elicitation frequency is normalized by the interaction length, online experience remains the only factor that distinguishes between active and non-active questioners.

A conceptual framework is proposed to demonstrate the impact of contextual variables on patron elic-itation behavior. Fig. 3 illustrates such a model. Status, age, and online search experience in the individual difference group or individual intermediaries in the situational group may affect patron elicitation behavior.
On the other hand, situational variables, such as actual time or interaction length of an encounter, show a relationship with patron elicitation behavior. In addition, situational and individual difference variables re-veal an intertwined relationship. For example, age and interaction length are likely to be related. That is, variables such as patrons  X  status and age lose their impact once patron elicitations are normalized by inter-action length; only patrons  X  online search experience retains an impact on their elicitation behavior. A pos-sible interpretation could be that people need to know something in order to ask relevant questions, and when they know something, they may feel more confident to ask questions. On the other hand, people fail to ask questions either because they do not have enough knowledge to form a question or they do not real-ize a need to ask various sorts of questions. Intermediaries should be able to judge which type a patron belongs to based on an inferred user model in order to determine proper communication strategy, to pro-voke questions or to offer explanation unprompted. 6. Possible implications for a theory of MLIS
A framework of MLIS theory in information retrieval interaction includes at least three threads: (1) pa-ment-related; (3) patrons  X  elicitation behavior relates to the contextual variables, and thus is predictable.
MLIS also demonstrates professional identity of an intermediary. Findings on the relationship between contextual variables and patron elicitation behavior suggest that a dialogue-based question-answering IR system may augment a knowledge base to satisfy the patron  X  s MLIS during the online search process.
As such, it enhances intermediaries  X  training by taking into account that patron elicitations are good sources for forming user models ( Daniels, 1987, p. 25 ). Better understanding of patrons  X  MLIS may im-prove the IR system by providing a better interface to support terms and search procedure, e.g., a well-de-signed thesaurus and easier-to-use functions. 7. Future research
Although this study has identified some significant contextual variables related to patron elicitation behavior, patrons with extreme elicitation behavior and their individual characteristics need further inves-tigation. Detailed analysis on a case-by-case basis would support the findings beyond Chi-squared tests.
Furthermore, although the findings of the study on patron elicitation purposes and a significant relation-ship between patron elicitation frequency and interaction length support the proposed elicitation process model, more parts of the process deserve further study. For example, the linking between an elicitation and a response has not been clear. Although theoretical work (e.g., Goffman, 1976 ) and previous empirical suggest useful elicitation-answer models, empirical study of the situation of information retrieval interaction is particularly essential within the context of information seeking. Case studies for in-depth analysis of encounters to study patron and intermediary elicitation and response patterns are recommended.
