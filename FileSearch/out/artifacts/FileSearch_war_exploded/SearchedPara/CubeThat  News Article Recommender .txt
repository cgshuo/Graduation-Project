 The CubeThat browser extension for Chrome displays recommended additional news stories related to the same topic as the current news story. The recommended stories are organized into clusters, and clusters that the user has already sampled from are grayed out, in order to encourage users to explore multiple aspects of a story. Users can also provide feedback to improve the clustering, by dragging stories from one cluster to another.

News, which was once heavily dependent on print media, is now consumed digitally. The Web pr ovides much more freedom in selection of news sources and types than any other previous media. But Sunstein &amp; others have argued that that freedom will lead to social fragmentation becaus e self-selection of stories will lead people to only expose them selves to like-minded viewpoints [1]. Similarly, Eli Pariser has argued recommender systems, in a race to please the users, create invisible, personal universes of results around them [2]. Among ot her problems, this could lead people to think that their opinions are more broadly shared than they actually are [3]. However, personalization systems can be designed to deliberately inject diversity into a user X  X  information diet too [7]. Park et. al.[4] found that when people are presented with stories organized into meaningful cluste rs, in their NewsCube system, it cued people to read more and diverse stories about a single topic. Eveland et. al. [5] found that structuring knowledge so that reading is not a linear activity can be effective in creating dense knowledge structures. In other words, providing affordances while a person is reading an article to traverse other parts of the same topic can lead to denser knowledge structures. We will demo a browser extensi on that encourages users to explore multiple aspects of ne ws topics, by recommending other stories related to the current story the user is reading. The recommendations are not personali zed, but as in the NewsCube system, the browser keeps track of which clusters each user has already explored and thus cues th em to explore additional clusters. stories from popular news sites, a nd clusters them by topic. The recommendation engine further clusters articles within each topic. Initially, it applies the algorithm used in Newscube [4] to cluster the articles; later it incorporates user feedback to modify the within-topic clustering. Clustered news articles are served through a browser extension (Chrome) wh ich is the interface for the recommender. the extension icon in the browser header to get recommendations for that article. Figure 2 shows an example recommendation for a news article. For each cluster in a topic, four or less relevant stories are picked. For each story, the source and count of how many Twitter tweets link to the story are shown. A user who disagrees with the clustering of stories can drag a story from one cluster to another and this move affects the recommendations that will be shown to other users as well. If the last story is removed from a cluster, that cluster is deleted, as illustrated in Figure 3, where the sole story from cluster 5 has been moved to cluster 4. opened. If a user has previously opened any story in a cluster, that cluster is shaded, as in the original NewsCube interface [4]. Figure 4 shows the recommendation after another story has been read from a different cluster. Figure 2. An example recommendation; darkened cluster shows the user has already sampled from it. Figure 3. The recommendations after the sole story from cluster 5 is moved to cluster 4. Figure 4. The recommendations after a story from cluster 3 has been read. When users reassign stories to di fferent clusters or new stories arrive that are part of an existing topic, we have to find a suitable clustering of new &amp; existing stories that takes into account both the text features and the previous user actions. There has been a lot of research on constrained clustering [6] but here we face multiple constraints together. Agai n, we propose and use a simple solution to the problem. First, from the story assignment to clusters, as adjusted by the most recent user, we compute the cluster centroid for each cluster in the database. For stories that were not displayed as part of the recommendations, including new stories, we compute the distan ce from cluster centroids and allocate each to the closest. The simplicity of the algorithm ensures that running time is linear in the number of stories about the topic. concerns regarding polarization due to selective exposure when reading news online. The proposed Chrome extension should cue people to read about more different aspects of a news story. In future work, we plan to incorpor ate other diversit y factors besides the words used in the stories, such as the political ideology of the stories, which we have been able to classify automatically using semi-supervised learning algorithms [8]. The usability of the extension will need to be honed through iterative testing and the efficacy of the extension in en couraging people to consume more diverse news will need to be measured through field trials.
