 Lexical ambiguity and its relationship to Information Re-trieval (IR) has been object of many studies in the past decade. One of the most debated issues is whether Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is useful to IR or not. The objective of this Ph.D. thesis is to study the effects of to-ponym (place name) ambiguity and its resolution on the Geographical Information Retrieval (GIR) task. In GIR to-ponym ambiguity represents an important issue, due to the fact that queries are geographically constrained. There has been a struggle to find specific geographical IR methods that actually outperform traditional IR techniques. This effort was the main objective of the GeoCLEF track at CLEF Toponym ambiguity may constitute a relevant factor in the inability of current GIR systems to take advantage from ge-ographical knowledge.

Previous studies of ambiguity and IR suggested that dis-ambiguation may be useful in some specific IR scenario. My hypothesis is that GIR may constitute such a scenario, and, consequently, that there is a correlation between retrieval performance and toponym ambiguity. This hypothesis re-lies on Mark Sanderson X  X  work [2], which showed that a 20%  X  30% extent of error rate in disambiguation was enough to worsen the performance of the IR method, and on the work of Stokoe et al. [3], which showed an increase in pre-cision for IR with a WSD accuracy of 62 . 1%.

I carried out a preliminary study using the WordNet-based collection developed for the CLEF CLIR-WSD task 2 and the GeoCLEF collection of 100 geographically related top-ics. The collection is composed by the 1995 Glasgow Herald and 1994 Los Angeles Times document collections, where each word (toponyms too) has been automatically assigned a WordNet sense. The object of the study was to obtain a figure of how much Mean Average Precision is affected by toponym ambiguity. The GIR system was based on Ge-oWorSE that participated in GeoCLEF 2008[1]. Each to-ponym in the collection is searched in WordNet, looking for the synonyms and the holonyms of the toponym  X  X ense X  as-signed as a result of the disambiguation. The synonyms and holonyms are added to an expanded index for the doc- X

For instance,  X  X ome X  is expanded with the synonyms  X  X oma X ,  X  X talian capital X , and the holonyms  X  X taly X ,  X  X talia X ,  X  X urope X . Therefore, a doc-ument containing the word  X  X ome X  but not  X  X taly X  will be retrieved as a result for the topic  X  X estivals in Italy X , con-sidering the expansion  X  X ome X   X   X  X taly X .

Retrieval experiments were carried out comparing the re-sults obtained with the CLIR-WSD collection with those obtained by randomly disambiguating the documents col-lection and those obtained by using always the most com-mon referent (according to WordNet). The obtained results show no significant differences between the different strate-gies for disambiguation, although the work gave an insight into some errors that are produced by toponym ambiguity and how they may affect the results. The results also sug-gest that WordNet is not a suitable resource for the planned research, because of its low coverage. For future research, I plan to repeat the experiments with a toponym gazetteer instead of WordNet, such as the GNS and GNIS databases, and to use pseudo-words for the representation of the am-biguous toponyms.
