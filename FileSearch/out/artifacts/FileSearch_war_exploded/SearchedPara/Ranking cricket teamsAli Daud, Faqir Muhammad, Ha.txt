 1. Introduction
Sports ratings are performed for showing the standings of different teams and players by analyzing the results of  X  teams by considering graph weightage in addition to simply considering the number of won or lost matches.
We propose Team-index (t-index) (non-graph weightage, as it does not consider the weight of the nodes with which ranked. TR considers the strength and weakness of the teams from which a team wins while ignores the number of runs and wickets from which matches are won. Consequently, we propose weighted TeamRank (WTR) which also considers simultaneously. Finally, the t-index (non-graph weightage) is merged with WTR (graph weightage) to propose hybrid ible and can be easily applied for T20 teams ranking as well.
 cricket teams rankings of ODI and test matches.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic concepts and terminologies followed by tion 6 finally concludes this work. 2. Basic concepts and terminologies 2.1. Team structure by the batsman.

A cricket team consists of eleven players in the ground and a 12th player which enters the ground to replace injured decide which team will bat and which team will bowl. The toss wining captain decides that her team will bat or bowl. runs wins the match. 2.2. Ground over the world such as 60 m and also 95 m. 2.3. Pitch
Pitch is 22 m area on which wickets are on both sides and bowlers bowls and batsman tries to hit the ball. 2.4. Over
An  X  X  X ver X  X  is defined as a set of six balls bowled consecutively by a bowler. 2.5. Scoring another bowler bowls an over from the other side of pitch.
 win from runs and wickets both in different matches. 2.6. One day internationals (ODI) saving some wickets wins the match. 2.7. Test matches restriction in ODI matches. The teams can win from wickets and runs and sometime even one innings plus some wickets or runs. 2.8. International Cricket Council (ICC) the teams with highest ratings in both ODI and test matches. ICC is also responsible for making new rules and making amendments in the existing rules for cricket. 3. Related work
There is not much work done about cricket teams ranking using state-of-the-art indexing and ranking methods, such as made for sports teams including cricket teams are explained. 3.1. H-index and its major extensions
H-index ( Hirsch, 2005 ) was proposed for scientist X  X  productivity indexing in co-author networks. It considers both not provide scientist an edge on the basis of their highly cited papers is discussed by Egghe (2006) and G-index was proposed. In it highly cited papers are given extra weightage.
 been explored much for other domains such as teams and players indexing and needs to be explored. 3.2. PageRank and its major extensions independent importance of web pages. In order to get more realistic results dependent on query based importance importance on that topic.
 web pages related to a query as compared to traditional PageRank algorithm.

Time factor importance in order to find authoritative web pages was highlighted and Time-Weighted PageRank was pro-web page. Results were compared with the PageRank results and it is found that Time-Weighted PageRank produces more trend. 3.3. PageRank adoptions formed better as compared to degree, closeness and betweenness centrality measures.

Social tagging systems have emerged quickly on the web in which users adds tags to the resources according to their of undirected links between them. It was also applied for finding communities in these social tagging systems. network data of tuberculosis bacterium as well as on blood of melanoma patients for proteomics analysis. 3.4. Social network analysis for sports teams hybridization of graph and non-graph based runs and wickets considering weightage methods. 4. Cricket teams ranking In this section, before describing our proposed (1) Team-Index, (2) TeamRank, (3) Weighted TeamRank, and (4) Unified
Weighted TeamRank methods, we briefly introduce related ICC ranking method teams. 4.1. ICC cricket teams ranking system
The ICC employs ratings formulas for both ODI and test matches to determine a champion the following way. 4.1.1. ODI matches 4.1.2. Test matches 4.2. H-index
Hirsch (2005) proposed an indexing measure used to index the scientists on the basis of her productivity in terms of has index h if h of [his/her] N p papers have at least h citations each, and the other ( N
The following normalized formula can be used to calculate h-index in an easy way. value ranges between 3 and 5, usually 4 to handle the square root. 4.3. PageRank algorithm web page is linked by many other web pages and the pages providing inlinks are themselves important then the page is where PR ( A ) is PageRank of A , PR ( T i ) are PageRanks of pages which are providing the links to page A , CT whose value usually used in literature is 0.85. 4.4. Team-index (t-index) matches from more number of runs and wickets the higher the t-index the team will have.

We take an example of a team A which played 15 matches in total from which 7 matches are won by runs and 8 matches are won by wickets. Tables 1a and 1b for team A are used to calculate its t-index as follows. 4.5. TeamRank (TR) calculated by using the following formula.
 where, TR ( A ) is the TeamRank of Team A , TR ( T i ) is the TeamRank of Teams T teams matches lost from another team say a team lost 14 matches then outlinks will be 14. 4.6. Weighted TeamRank (WTR) matches from more runs and wickets will contribute less to the rank of the team being ranked.
An example is provided to show how the parameter of runs and wickets impact the ranking of teams. Suppose we have tributes less score to the team from which the team has lost matches (see Tables 2a and 2b ). WTR is calculated by using the following formula.
 where WTR(A) is the weighted TeamRank of Team A, WTR(Ti) is the TeamRank of Teams Ti which link (lose matches) to runs or wickets whose weightage is 20% and 20%, respectively used in this work. 4.7. Unified weighted TeamRank (UWTR)
Our proposed fourth method UWTR is hybridization of t-index and WTR methods. UWTR combines the power of a team in calculated by using the following formula.
 where WT j is the t-index of the team for which we are calculating the rank, 5. Experiments methods is also studied. 5.1. Dataset
The dataset for experiments is taken from the cricinfo web site club team players of Islamabad and Faisalabad.
 Strong teams: Australia, India, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, West Indies, England, New Zealand.
Weak teams: Zimbabwe, Bangladesh. 5.2. Results and discussions 5.2.1. One day international matches from which the teams have won matches. The top 3 teams ranked by ICC ranking are Australia, South Africa and India, t-index due to winning from less number of runs and wickets from other teams as compared to Sri Lanka which have won matches from more wickets and runs as compared to India so is ranked 3rd.
 are also ranked higher by TR as compared to South Africa due to their most winnings from stronger teams.
By applying our proposed third WTR method we got different results as from TR method. By this method South Africa other team by considering number of runs and wickets from which matches are won. South Africa has won more matches from weaker teams resulted in winning matches from large number of runs and wickets so is ranked number one. winning from less runs and wickets. 5.2.2. Test matches wickets from which the teams have won matches. The top 3 teams ranked by ICC ranking are England, South Africa and wickets from other teams as compared to Sri Lanka which have won matches from more wickets and runs as compared to South Africa so is ranked 3rd.
 Lanka as compared to South Africa.
 matches from weaker teams resulted in winning matches from large number of runs and wickets so is ranked number one. when graph based strength or weakness of teams is considered. For our proposed all methods Australian team is ranked number one for both ODI and Test matches due to winning from more runs and wickets as well as from stronger teams.
The results for WTR method are a bit different though in which other teams are ranked on top. 5.3. Effect of damping factor on teams ranking
Parameter d is used in our three proposed methods TR, WTR and UWTR. As d is the dampening actor which is used to is discussed in the following section. 5.3.1. ODI matches overall ranking of teams remains almost same for different values of d . 5.3.2. Test matches respectively for ODI matches. 6. Conclusions is also important when two teams X  win similar number of matches from similar kind of opponents. The hybridization of has similar affect on TR, WTR and UWTR methods when they are used for ranking teams for test matches. considering temporal dimension.
