Recently we saw several major scientific and engineering advances that were stimulated by a grand challenge/prize [1, 2]. The DARPA Grand Challenge produced great advances in robotic car navigation in 2005; X-prize led to the first successful commercial spaceflight; and RoboCup, whose goal is to developing a team of humanoid robots that can win against the human world soccer champion team by 2050, has greatly advanced robotic performance and created many enthusiasts. Is there a grand challenge pr oblem for data mining ? This question is timely --X-prize foundation is looking for additional fields where the prize can be created. A good grand challenge problem s hould satisfy several criteria: 1) It should be relevant to da ta mining and knowledge discovery and be based on analysis of large volumes of data, preferably publicly available data. 2) It should be sufficiently important and difficult so that its solution will advance the field and benefit the society at large. 3) It should be interesting and exciting to attract researchers, public and press attention, and funding. This requires a simple and concise problem statemen t  X  one or two sentences. 4) The required domain knowledge should be relatively accessible. 5) Other groups are not actively working on this problem already. Some potential ideas for a grand challenge include: We examine several current hot research areas including web mining, text mining, link analys is, video and image mining, and bioinformatics, and discuss possi ble proposals for an exciting and worthwhile grand challenge / X-prize for data mining. Multimedia data is growing at enormous rate. While it contains much valuable information, because it is mostly un-structured or semi-structured, it is difficult (i f not impossible) for people to extract the information without powerful tools. Multimedia mining systems could automatically extract semantically meaningful information (knowledge) from multimedia data. This research overlaps several area: multimedia indexing and retrievals, multimedia semantics, pattern recognition, and multimedia usage mining. The common points of these sub-area of research concern a large number of techniques that ha ve been proposed ranging from simple features (e.g. color histogram for images, energy estimates for audio signal, texture, shapes ) to more sophisticated systems like user multimodality (hand, body, eye) capturing and mining, speaker emotion recognition in a udio, automatic summarization of TV programs, extracting relati onships between video events, extracting eye-tracking pattern from several user scan paths, classifying images based on their content, extracting patterns in sound, categorizing speech and music, and recognizing and tracking objects in video streams, etc. Multimedia mining involves several layers of transformations of features from low level to semantics, consisting of : quality, during 2006 in Europe), transformation, feature selection, (e.g., shooting the ball, goal, running) or objects (ball, football discovering knowledge, such as re lationships between objects or segments within multimedia (e.g ., Zidane passing to Dugarie). the final application X  X  knowledge. Multimedia usage mining and multimedia semantics are two promising aspects of multimedia mining. Multimedia usage mining place the user in the center of multimedia documents. It cons ists of extracting knowledge involving the usage of the user of multimedia data. The problem concerns: -making multimedia trackable, saving all user operations (e.g., play, pause, visualize, eye fixation) and multimedia pieces concerned by these operations, -mining user actions, considering for example, intra/inter video actions, the user is included in the loop of multimedia semantic. Multimedia semantics has been studied for quite some time. What is now needed is for researchers to develop approaches to extract semantics from multimedia documents so that retrievals using concept-based queries can be ta ilored to individual users. The semantic gap, or, as others put it, the semantic chasm, must be crossed. Multimedia usage mining coupled with domain ontology may be a revolutionary way to deal with the lack of semantics in multimedia information, and will certainly contribute to the hot domain of multimedia semantics. Two categories of challenges turn around usage and data. 1) Mining user behaviors in interactions with multimedia data to anticipate future behaviors or to diagnose medical or psychological conditions of the user s. The challenge is to mine not only explicit actions (interactions, navigation), but also implicit reactions such as eye/gaze fixation, emotions (70% of people is emotion), heartbeat, respiration rate, stress, etc. The challenge is also to use non-in trusive sensors (e.g., cameras), rather than intrusive sensors. 2) Crossing the semantic gap between multimedia data and semantics. The challenge is to extract automatically the meaning of multimedia content so that exploitation (e.g., retrievals) using semantic information can be tailo red to individual applications process considering the high volume, the complexity and the heterogeneity of multimedia data. Multimedia data is the most natural information-conveying vehi cle but also the most complex to index and mine. The challenge is to generate metadata that describe the content and that may be exploitable in applications. Many data mining domains of intere st today are best described as networks or graphs. Common exam ples include social networks, biological networks and communi cation networks. There are interesting practical and theoretical issues in mining such data; in some cases there are also difficult legal and privacy issues. While certain link mining problems such as mining call records for terrorist activity have received a lot of recent media attention, they do not meet the requirements of a grand challenge as potential link mining problems th at make appropriate grand challenges. Following [3], we divide data mi ning grand challenges into three categories: and application challenges rela ted to important technical problems, such as scaling data mining algorithms, mining complex data types, mining mixtures of data, etc. foundations for working with large, complex data. preparation and integration, and developing, deploying and embedding statistical and data mining models. For comparison, let X  X  consider technical, theoretical and pragmatic challenges from related computer science fields. For example, technical challenges in computing include building a petaflow computer, developing a terabit network, or building an autonomous vehicle that can cross a desert. Theoretical challenges in computing include proving P != NP or developing new algorithms for factoring inte gers with a thousand digits. Finally, pragmatic challenges in computing include building databases that can manage trillions of rows or ones that can break the current TPC-C benchmark. We discuss technical challenges involving the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), a multi-terabyte data set of astronomical data, focusing on problems related to the classification of objects in the SDSS, to analyzing SDSS data re motely, and to the distributed integration of SDSS data with ot her astronomical data sets, such as the 2 Micron All Sky Survey Data (2MASS). I will also discuss several pragmatic challenges involving deploying and embedding analytics. In particular, I X  X l discuss the development of a standard-based infrastructure that can meet the requirements needs of those de ploying and embedding analytic models, but is also powerfu l enough to capture the data preparation and data integration that is also required in applications. Finally, I X  X l discuss the developm ent of community benchmarks so that we can measure our progress in developing scalable algorithms for clustering, regressi on and other standard problems. Text Mining is an exciting research area that tries to solve the information overload problem by using techniques from data mining, machine learning, NLP, IR and knowledge management. Text Mining involves the prepro cessing of document collections (text categorization, information extraction, term extraction), the storage of the intermediate representations, the techniques to analyze these intermediate repres entations (distribution analysis, clustering, trend analysis, association rules etc) and visualization of the results. Here are some of the grand challenges that are facing the text mining research area: 1. Most text analytics systems rely on accurate extraction of entities and relations from the documents. However, the accuracy of the entity extraction systems in some of the domains reaches only 70-80% and creates a noise level which prohibits the adaptation of text mining system s by a wider audience. We are seeking domain independent ad language independent NER (named entity recognition) systems that will be able to reach an accuracy of 99-100%. Based on such system, we are seeking domain independent ad language independent relation extraction systems that will be able to reach precision of 98-100% and recall of 95-100%. Since the systems should work in any domain they must be totally autonomous and require no human intervention. 2. Based on systems deve loped in step 1, we would like to have text mining systems that will be able to pass standard reading comprehension tests such as SAT, GRE, GMAT etc. Systems that will be able to pass the average scores will win the grand challenge. The systems can utilize the web when answering the test questions . 3. Text Analytics systems today ar e pretty much user guided, and they enable users to view various aspects of the corpus. The grand challenge is to have a text analytics system which is totally autonomous and will analyze huge corpuses and come up with truly interesting findings that are no captured by any single document in the corpus and are not known before. The system can utilize the internet to filter findi ngs that are already known. The "interest" measure which is totally subjective will be defined by a committee of experts in each domain. Such systems can then be used for alerting purposes in the financial domain, the anti-terror domain, the biomedical domai n and many other commercial domains. The system will get streams of documents from a variety of sources and send ema ils to relevant people if an "interesting" finding is detected. Large-scale databases from se quencing projects, microarray studies, gene-function studies, protein-protein interactions, comparative genomics, structural biology, and open source journal articles, are growing at rapid rates. The challenge in systems biology is to connect all the dots from the diverse molecular, cellular, organism a nd environmental data sources to deduce how sub-systems and whole organisms work. We need to decipher the language of life  X  the language of the genome, protein folding, developmental pathways, and much more. Some of the scientific challenges include how to infer the complete network that controls genes, to infer the complex signaling pathways that regulate the health of the cell, to infer how cell specialization occurs during development, and so on. There are numerous computational challenges in collecting, indexing, searching and mining thes e vast data sources. I will try to outline a few data mining challenges in bioinformatics such as in gene regulation, protein fold ing, and so on. For example, discovering how, when and where th e genes are expressed is one such grand challenge. The goal is to infer the transcription machinery and the gene regulatory circuitry. The central actors include, proteins that shut down/activate genes, transcription factors that bind to specific regions, chromatin proteins that may expose different genes, microRNA and other small RNA, etc. Mining the diverse sources of public data pertaining to these actors will be a crucial component in piecing together the bigger picture.
