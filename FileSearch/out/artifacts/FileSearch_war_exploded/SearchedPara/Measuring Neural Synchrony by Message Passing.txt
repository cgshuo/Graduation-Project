The conditional distributions in X and X 0 are equal to: where V information about  X  Eventually, marginalizing (2) w.r.t. v results in the model: p ( x, x 0 , b, b 0 ,  X  t , s t , ` ) = with ( x spurious event pairs, and  X  = p J n , B and B 0 can directly be obtained from J and J 0 .
 It also noteworthy that T Given event strings X and X 0 , we wish to determine the parameters  X  variables B and B 0 ; the parameter  X  spur (cf.

We determine the alignment C = ( C maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation: where p ( y, y 0 , c,  X  ) is obtained from (14) by marginalizing over b and b 0 : p ( y, y 0 , c,  X  )  X  From  X  c , we obtain the estimate  X   X  spur as: parameters  X  are initialized:  X   X  (0) following two update rules until convergence (or until the a vailable time has elapsed): computed over all pairs of non-spurious events.
