 REGULAR PAPER Isis Truck  X  Herman Akdag Abstract In this article, qualitative, symbolic and linguistic models for knowl-edge representation are presented as well as their applications. Such models are useful in decision making problems when information from the experts X  knowledge is expressed through different heterogeneous types such as numerical, interval-valued, symbolic, linguistic, ... The whole work proposed here takes place in a given many-valued logic. First, as an alternative to classic probabilities, a method using qualitative degrees is described and an application in supervised learning is proposed. Then we study the transformation of these degrees when they are subjected to a modification: thus we present the Generalized Symbolic Modifiers . These tools are defined as manipulations computed on a pair (degree, scale). They are grouped together into several families and thus offer many and shows the feasibility of the approach. The last point addressed in this article is the data combination. An operator called the Symbolic Weighted Median gives a summary of several qualitative degrees with associated weights. One particularity is that this median is constructed on the Generalized Symbolic Modifiers . Finally we explain how the Symbolic Weighted Median is exploited in the internal mechanism of the application in colorimetrics.
 Keywords Many-valued logic  X  Qualitative data  X  Symbolic data  X  Modification  X  Combination  X  Uncertainty 1 Introduction In decision making systems, most information that experts manipulate is hetero-geneous, i.e. is either numerical, linguistic, interval-valued, ... or expressed with fuzzy numbers. In such a case, there are many methods to aggregate information and unify it, for example those from [ 13 , 17 ] ... The use of qualitative structured symbols, or degrees seems appropriate and pertinent for this kind of information, that is why, in this article, we focus on the manipulation of these degrees under uncertainty and imprecise reasoning. In order to simulate or to automatize expert reasoning, it is necessary to study the representation and treatment of discrete and linguistic data [ 2 , 3 , 14 , 19 , 22 ].

In other words, the predicate A is satisfiable to a certain degree expressed through the scalar ad-verb v  X  .

Indeed, Zadeh X  X  variables are represented through fuzzy sets while qualitative degrees are represented through symbols or linguistic expressions in this many-valued logic framework. Anyway, De Glas et al. approaches can take place in qualitative theory because they manipulate words but they can also be considered as strong alterna-tives of fuzzy or probabilistic theory because they achieve similar formal results. the classical probability theory and possibility theory.
 tainties. Among these [ 6 , 10 , 27 ] present approaches where the investigation is motivated by finding a model which simulates several actions of a cognitive agent. One action is the management of uncertain statements of natural language which are defined thanks to a finite totally ordered set of symbolic values. The approach consists in representing, exploiting and even computing the uncertainty with qual-itative degrees. These degrees can be interpreted as  X  X ymbolic X  and  X  X ompara-tive X  degrees of uncertainty. The four elementary arithmetic operations [ 28 ]are re-defined in order to manipulate these qualitative degrees. Thus, the second sec-and division operators that are based on Lukasiewicz implication and on the sym-bolic complementation. A formal and rigorous model is defined to evaluate and compute uncertainties through qualitative degrees. The proposed axioms and the derived properties detailed further can be used in Bayesian networks as well as in knowledge-based systems, in the lack of reliability quantitative estimation. It M  X  antaras in [ 20 ]. Well-chosen formulas permit to easily translate the four basic operations (which can be represented through synthetic tables) respecting required properties. Adequate qualities of these operations are strengthened by results (the-orems) of the proposed Axiomatic. All the propositions are obtained thanks to log-ical formulas that use the implication of Lukasiewicz and the operations addition, subtraction, min and max. Thus, one can tell that the proposed qualitative model uses the four symbolic operators, operating on integers, and this constitutes a link between the qualitative and the numerical model.

They have both developed an axiomatic theory, which allows to obtain theo-approach: it is a matter of an application in supervised learning where the useful-ness of symbolic probabilities (especially the efficiency of the four operators) is shown. The theoretical part of this section as well as the application are summaries of previous works. The originality lies in the way we link these prior works and the new ones presented in the following sections.
 set of seven degrees, L 7 ,in[ 22 ]). It means that, in a reasoning process, the re-sult of a cognitive operator cannot be given with more precision (or less) than the granularity of the scale. i.e. if the result is between two consecutive degrees, then an approximation is necessary. In the second part (Sect. 3), this problem of approximation is being solved thanks to qualitative tools that permit the refine-ment of a symbolic variable: this way, data can be represented with the needed The degrees are still totally ordered and constitute a scale. Qualitative tools to compare and combine these degrees are introduced: the generalized symbolic modifiers . They act both on degrees and scales and permit to reach the needed level of precision. Another application is described: we propose to use the quali-tative modifiers to express and define small or less small changes of a given color, in order to reach the exact color fitting the user needs. This application is a part of a software that retrieves images according to the dominant color(s) expressed linguistically.
 fusion is performed between a colorimetric qualifier (e.g.  X  X eep X ), a qualitative corresponds in fact to values of weights associated with the different qualifiers available in the software. This aggregation is the result of a qualitative operator: the symbolic weighted median that is presented in Sect. 4. Of course, this new tool can also be used in practical studies such as surveys where we want to ob-tain a summary of different opinions with various weights. In this case and on the contrary to [ 11 , 27 ] ... the underlying condition is that all the degrees have not (necessarily) the same importance, i.e. the same weight. In many situations, one can have recourse to weights to express the relative importance of an expert opin-ion, or to express the confidence that one has in data, etc. The symbolic weighted median computes a kind of center of gravity, i.e. it gives the emergent element of a set of ordered weighted degrees. This tool uses the generalized symbolic modifiers in its construction because the emergent element obtained is one of the initial ele-ments, but slightly or strongly modified . Sections 3 and 4 constitute a continuation of previous works presented in Sect. 2. 2 Qualitative degrees As a continuation of the work of Akdag et al. [ 2 ] on the representation of the un-certainty via the many-valued logic, the first step of the approach is the proposition of an axiomatic for symbolic probability theory [ 2 ]. Khoukhi [ 18 ] and Akdag and Khoukhi [ 3 ] went further in the field of representation uncertainty and imprecision via the many-valued logic. They have proposed several solutions for the definition of each symbolic operator. Using theoretical results of [ 3 , 18 ] Seban [ 25 ]gavea convincing example of practical application in pattern recognition. Similarly, Pa-cholczyk and Pacholczyk [ 24 ] have proposed a new version of this theory that seems not totally satisfactory.
 L M . For sake of simplicity, all the examples in this section are in degree of the scale, a linguistic value can be associated: plementation  X  . In order to be able to rewrite (or to translate in symbolic) the having introduced the concept of total order in the scale of degrees, it is easy to see as in [ 10 ] that it is necessary to define a symbolic addition (or a symbolic t -conorm, to generalize the addition), a symbolic multiplication (or a symbolic t -norm in order to be able to translate the disconditioning and the independence) and a symbolic division (to translate the conditioning).
 of the division of A by B then B multiplied by C gives A  X  (relationship between the qualitative multiplication and the qualitative division). This constraint which ity lies in the definition of a qualitative subtraction instead of the use (sometimes artificially) of the complementation operator. Thus, a symbolic difference is de-fined to translate the subtraction.

The modelisation is based on automatic generation of classification rules. The classi-fication function is directly given in the form of production rule base. In pattern recognition, expert rules allow to determine the belonging of a pixel to a class, e.g. in a human thigh cryosection image a pixel shall be classified as bone, muscle, etc. Thus, starting from the expertise given by a medical expert such as P i  X  C j ,where P is a pixel and C j a class defined by the domain specialist, we build classification rules 11 automatically.
 permits to construct automatically the rules (learning phase). The second one the inference engine that uses the rules to classify new pixels. This work has been im-plemented in a software called SUCRAGE and confronted with a real application in the field of multi-component image segmentation. 2.3.1 Production rules Starting from a training set, i.e. a set of pixels classified by an expert, we auto-matically construct the rules base. The expert represents the pixel by a vector: each pixel feature corresponds to a vector component. The training set is the set of classified vectors. A vector component can be, for instance, the pixel gray-level which is a numerical value but its expression through qualitative degrees is more significative and more efficient.
 X generated rules are as follows: nent, the interval [ a , b ] is issued from a membership function of a fuzzy set which interprets imprecise knowledge such as  X  X mall X ,  X  X ore or less X ,  X  X arge X  ... C i is a hypothesis about membership in a class with a qualitative belief degree  X  i . Indeed, the global range of a component is decomposed into a finite set of sub-ranges of equal width. For example, if the global range is [0, 255] and if the finite number ( M ) is equal to 7, then we obtain the following intervals rg 1 =[ 0 , 36 ] (  X  1 ), rg 3 corresponding to  X  X ery large X  (  X  6 ).
 search among the training set elements. Each premise thus obtained leads to c rules, where c is the total number of classes. To compute the number of possi-finally, the belief degree associated with each conclusion is computed using the well-known Bayesian formulas on the training set. The obtained numerical belief degree is easily transformed into a qualitative form by decomposing the range or using an interactive interface. 2.3.2 Approximate reasoning The reasoning used in inference system of this application is, as we have seen, components match exactly, but also some neighborhood rules. The Generalized Modus Ponens scheme defined above is used.
 components. Then the inference engine groups the fired rules together according degree associated with each class using a conorm as an aggregator. Two different conorms are computed: the first is the Zadeh conorm S ( p , q ) = max ( p , q ) and the second one is the probabilistic one S ( p , q ) = p + q  X  pq . The multiplication, operators permit to use a conorm that improves the results in the most cases. the final belief degree is maximum. 2.3.3 Results Different kinds of data have been tested: notably Iris database and human thigh cryosection data. The experimental results were obtained using the cross-reference validation method. In the case of Iris data, the number of classes is three and ob-servations are represented by four component vectors. The results are satisfactory and reach 98% of good classification with 23 rules. Table 3 shows a comparative study with other learning methods for Iris data. 3 Symbolic modification The qualitative tools presented in the previous section permit to manipulate knowl-edge in a same level of granularity. What follows is an approach that deals with many levels of granularity: it is refered to the question of modification. Zadeh, Bouchon-Meunier, Akdag et al., Herrera et al., L  X  opezdeM  X  antaras et al., etc. Zadeh has introduced the notion of linguistic hedges [ 35 ] and other authors as Bouchon-Meunier have defined reinforcing and weakening fuzzy modifiers (de-fined thanks to fuzzy subsets) [ 8 ]. This notion of modifiers has been used in many fields. For example, L  X  opezdeM  X  antaras and Arcos have presented a system that is able to generate expressive music by means of fuzzy modification of parameters such as vibrato, dynamics, rubato ... [ 21 ]. In [ 16 ], the modification between two fuzzy subsets is represented with a pair { linguistic term, translation } depending on a certain hierarchy (or precision level). The underlying framework is a scale of non-uniformly distributed symbols. Several hierarchies are used to express the distribution of symbols in a fuzzy way.
 been proposed in [ 4 ] in the many-valued logic context.
 vided into four classes: nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales [ 15 ]. A nomi-nal scale does not express any values or relationships between variables (except equality). An ordinal scale is a scale on which data is shown simply in order of magnitude. These types of scales permit the measurement of degrees of difference, but not the specific amount of difference. An interval scale is a scale according to which the differences between values can be quantified in absolute but not relative terms and for which any zero is merely arbitrary: for instance, dates are measured on an interval scale since differences can be measured in years. A ratio scale per-values cannot always be compared.
 performed by dilation or erosion of the scales [ 4 ]. Thus, this permits the obtention of modifiers that are functions allowing us to go from a degree to another. These generalized symbolic modifiers . 3.1 Definitions We state that a generalized symbolic modifier (GSM) corresponds to a semantic triplet of parameters: radius, nature (i.e. dilated, eroded or conserved) and mode (i.e. reinforcing, weakening or centring). The radius is denoted  X  with  X   X  N  X  . The more the radius, the more powerful the modifier.

The first family don X  X  alter the ratio but act as a zoom [ 5 , 33 ].

To compare the GSMs, an order relation can be estab-lished between them.

Furthermore, partial order relation. Comparing the generalized modifiers in pairs, it is possible to establish a partial order relation between them that can be expressed through a lattice (cf. Fig. 1 ). The relation is only partial because some modifiers cannot be compared with some others.
 in the lattice. 3.3 Finiteness and composition As the radius can be instanciated by any positive integer, the GSM may modify a bit, a lot or enormously the initial value. Following this idea, an interesting point is to see if the limits of the scale can be reached. In this perspective, notions of finite and infinite modifiers are defined.
 Definition 3.3 An infinite modifier m  X  is defined as follows: For example, DW(  X  )andDR(  X  ) can modify the initial value towards infinity. Definition 3.4 A finite modifier m  X  is defined as follows: initial value.
 sense) of the GSMs [ 30 ]. For example, composing a modifier ER with a modifier DR consists in applying (on an initial value) first a modifier DR and then a modi-fier ER. Two kinds of composition have to be distinguished: homogeneous and heterogeneous ones. Homogeneous compositions are compositions of modifiers from the same family with the same nature, same mode, same name but not necessarily the same radius (for example, a DW modifier with a DW modifier, or DW modifier with a DW modifier ... ). Any other form of composition is said to be heterogeneous: it means that heterogeneous compositions imply GSMs from different families. These compositions permit to reach any degree on any scale if necessary. Moreover, the linguistic counterpart can be expressed in combinations Thus, the following theorem can be easily proved [ 30 ]: Theorem 1 The result of the composition of generalized symbolic modifiers is also a generalized symbolic modifier: when composing n generalized symbolic modifiers (of any kinds), a valid pair degree/scale is always obtained. have been proved also in [ 30 ]: Theorem 2 If m  X  ...

X  Each color is transformed from RGB (Red, Green, Blue) space towards HLS (Hue, Lightness, Saturation) space, where the hue is defined thanks to fuzzy sets for a best performance. Modifying a color is in fact converted into a triplet ( color , modifier , qualifier ) such as  X  X lue much deeper. X  The modifier is a quali-tative degree and the color modification is performed thanks to the GSMs. The familyofGSMs(e.g.EWorDWor ... for weakening modifiers) is chosen ac-cording to the number of modifiers in the software. Thus, we associate colors to linguistic expressions. be changed thanks to a learning process in order to fit the user X  X  perception. Indeed, space would be very subjective. That is why we have adapted the software to the visual perception of the user [ 31 ].
 according to a learning done thanks to the user. To perform this, we use a graph and modifiers (such as  X  X uch more X ,  X  X  bit less X , etc.) in order to store the acquired knowledge and its associated nuance. Then, we use composition operations on modifiers in order to include an information intensity notion in the graph and to finally restore this intensity to the user in a coherent way. 3.4.2 Knowledge acquisition In our software, each qualifier ( X  X allid X ,  X  X right X , etc.) has a certain meaning ,i.e. it is associated with a certain treatment on the colour. A treatment on a colour con-sists in modifying its colourimetric components thanks to the GSMs. So we can associate to each qualifier a treatment. As explained, there is a modifier ( X  X uch more X , etc.) which tempers the treatment and brings a sort of nuance. We want to memorize both kinds of information in order to change the qualifiers X  and mod-ifiers X  meanings  X  X ccording to the user X  X  wishes and visual perception. For this problem, a modelling through a graph is very appropriate.
 treatment called trt X . Thus, the base of the graph is composed of qualifiers, e.g. X , and the top of the graph, of elementary modifications, e.g. trt X (cf. Fig. 2 ). dark enough, the system has to perform the following operation (cf. Fig. 3 ): (for dark), since the learning is processed on the modifier  X  X uch more. X  That is why we write  X  X  bit more given much more. X  whose treatment has already been modified, for example:  X  X ull X   X  X  X   X  X ull X  +  X  X uch less bluish. X  We obtain the graph shown on Fig. 4 . Of course, the problem of contingent loops has been considered and solved.
  X  X  bit more given much more X  in the previous example will be computed thanks to compositions of GSMs described above. More precisely, if, next time, the user asks for a  X  X it more bluish X  color, the system will have to take into account the modification  X  X  very little bit darker X  instead of  X  X  bit darker X  in the example. So the user handles the learning on the qualifiers and the system handles the learning on the modifiers.
 4 Symbolic combination: a median operator 4.1 Introduction notice that a modifier can be seen as a set of qualitative degrees associated with weights. Indeed, when we consider one qualitative degree  X  i among a scale of degrees, we can say that  X  i has the weight 1 and all other degrees have the weight 0. Thus, using modifiers can be seen as equivalent to changing the weights. This symbolic weighted median .
 dered elements set. Such an operator can be compared with the classical weighted median [ 34 ] where the result is sometimes unaccurate: weights w 0 ,w 1 ,...,w M  X  1 such as M  X  1 i = 0 w i = 1 and such as the M elements have to assume an order relation. The weighted median ( X  X essimistic X  12 or lower bound) is the element x k satisfying : x than the others: 1/6. Depending on the chosen definition, the median is 3 (pes-simistic) or 100 (optimistic). This result is inaccurate because elements are very heterogeneous. We will see that our median tries to solve this problem and to give a more precise result. 4.2 Definitions Let us consider M qualitative degrees being represented through a tree with a root and its M leaves. The weight of each degree is associated with the corresponding leaf, and a leaf may have a zero-weight. Conventionnally, the answers are ordered on the tree, with the weakest at the top.  X  i , M  X  1 is the i th initial degree. permits to express the degrees  X  i , M  X  1 and the second one permits to express the weights of the degrees (cf. Fig. 6 ).
  X  An answer whose label (identification) is id and whose weight is w is denoted  X  graphic representation: instead of using two trees, only one is enough (cf. Fig. 7 ).

As the triplet can be expressed through trees as seen above, we show in Fig. 11 that displaying the modified color leads to compute the SWM of qualitative degrees (the colors and their qualifiers) with associated weights (the modifiers).

The GSMs are very useful in the application in colorimetrics where they help to find the desired color according to a linguistic expression. We have also de-fined compositions of GSMs that permit to express linguistic assertions composed of more than one qualitative degree. These results are also important in the color application since they allow a learning process of the colors and their qualifiers depending on the user X  X  eye sensibility.
 gation: the symbolic weighted median that gives the emergent element of a set of weighted degrees. This aggregator looks for the gravity center of the qualitative degrees. This is a new point of view of the median vouched for the colourimetrics manipulations. Once again, this operator is used in the application in colourimet-rics to express the final color to be displayed. More precisely, the software uses the aggregator to combine one action (choice of color and qualifier) with the other (choice of modifier). Indeed, we explain that applying a modifier on a pair (color, qualifier) can be seen as equivalent to changing the weights associated with this pair. This is a very promising and original tool for manipulating the sensibility of the software user. In order terms, the symbolic weighted median is a formal complex tool for representing a natural operator.
 other natural or naive operators for the qualitative degrees may be found, and can be expressed by different formal aggregators.
