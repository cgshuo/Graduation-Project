 Political texts are pervasive on the Web covering laws and poli-cies in national and supranational jurisdictions. Access to this data is crucial for government transparency and accountability to the population. The main aim of our research is developing a rank-ing method for political documents which captures the interesting content within political documents. Text interestingness is a mea-sure of assessing the quality of documents from users X  perspective which shows their willingness to read a document. Different ap-proaches are proposed for measuring the interestingness of texts. In this research we focus on measuring political texts X  interestingness. As political data sources, we use publicly available parliamentary proceedings.
 Text Interestingness; Topical Diversity; Political Documents
Political texts such as parliamentary proceedings are valuable in-formation sources for historians, politicians, and also the public. Access to this data is crucial for government transparency and ac-countability to the population [2]. Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques to access and analyze the content of political data sources. In this research we focus on measuring the interest-ingness of political documents. Interestingness of documents could be used for ranking these documents and help the users to not only find the documents that are related to their information need but also focus on more interesting documents. The availability of user-generated text-based reviews stimulated research in automatically computing the interestingness of texts [3, 4]. Our main research question is: RQ1: What aspects of interesetingness are covered by current approaches? How can we incorporate the aspects related to documents content in text interestingness measures? Our main goal is to design a measure for estimating the interestingness of debates. In [3] it is shown that text interestingness is highly cor-related with topical diversity on e-books and e-commerce products description datasets. The current measures use either the topical diversity of documents to measure the interestingness of political debates [1] or the structural information of debates [6]. Both of these approaches do not use the main content of the debates for as-sessing their interestingness. We are aiming to propose text-based measures of interestingness for political debates and also leverage useful structural information of debates as well as the topical diver-sity of them.

We break RQ1.1 down into three research questions. We first study whether interestingness of political debates is correlated with their topical diversity and answer the following question: RQ1.2: Are topically diverse political documents also interesting? Usu-ally topical diversity of documents is measured by means of topic models. The main intuition is that if a document covers many dis-similar topics it is a diverse document. We propose a parsimoniza-tion technique [5] to extract salient information from topic models which makes them more suitable for the task of estimating diver-sity of documents compared to current topic models. The next re-search question is: RQ1.3: What are the main deficiencies of cur-rent topic models in estimating topical diversity of documents? And how effective is the proposed parsimonious topic model in address-ing these deficiencies? We use the proposed parsimonious topic models to measure the topical diversity of documents. Then us-ing the estimated diversity values for the debates, we analyze the impact of different sources of diversity on making the documents topically diverse. Our next research question is: RQ1.4: What are the main sources of diversity of debates? And how they affect the topical diversity of debates? As the sources of diversity, we study the effect of diversity of people participated in debates and the di-versity of main topics of debates. We incorporate these sources of diversity in our proposed interestingness and diversity measures.
