 NASA has some of the largest and most complex da ta sources in the worl d, with data sources ranging from the earth sciences, space sciences, and massive distributed engineering data sets from commercial aircraft and spacecraft. This talk will discuss some of the issues and algorithms developed to analyze and discover patterns in these data sets. We will also provide an overview of a large research program in Integrated Vehicle Health Management. The goal of this program is to develop advanced technologies to automatically detect, diagnose, predict, and mitigate adverse events during the flight of an aircraft. A case study will be presented on a recent data mining analysis performed to support the Flight Readin ess Review of the Space Shuttle Mission STS-119. Scientific Databases, Statistical Databases. Ashok N. Srivastava is the Princi pal Investigator of the Integrat ed Vehicle Health Management Project at NASA which is an agency-wide role in the NASA Aviation Safety Program. He also leads the Intelligent Data Understanding group at NASA Ames Research Center. The group performs research and development of advanced machine learning and data mining algorithms in support of NASA missions. He also develops new algorithms for studying climate change and the the large-scale structure of the universe. He has won numerous awards, including the NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal, one of NASA X  s highest awards, the NASA Distinguished Performance Award, several NASA Group Achievem ent Awards, and the IBM Golden Circle Award.
