 Behavior research on sociology show that peer pressure and group conformity can customer belongs to, one can derive common buying interests among customers, and services. There are many ways one can determine the groups a person belongs to, for and/or the places s/he visited. As implied by the loads of research in spatial-temporal databases [7], the information about users X  locations over time can play a crucial role in determining the groups. As mobile phones and other similar devices become mobile communication operators using the existing communication infrastructure. With more accurate positioning technologies, the errors can be reduced even further. 
In this research, we are interested in discovering groups of users such that users in time. Finding such grouping information of mobile users, based on the spatio-temporal distances among them, is known as  X  X roup patterns mining X , originally an object as a synchronous time series of locations. This representation, however, has the following three pitfalls: 1. To maintain accurate location tracking, th e frequency of sampling users X  locations must be high. As a result, the movement database can be become huge. 2. Moving objects may be disconnected from time to time voluntarily or involun for each time point. locations in reality due to clock differ ences of base stations conducting the sampling and the locations of moving objects. 
To deal with the first and the third problems, a trajectory-based model to represent derivative of each linear function yields the direction and speed in the associated time of an object from its location update data while saving storage space using dead-reckoning policies [11] or regression techniques [2]. In this paper, we use trajectories for modeling moving objects and develop efficient algorithms for discovering mobile allowing the trajectory of each object not to cover the entire location tracking period. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formally define the mobile group pattern discovery problem in the context of using trajectories to mobile group patterns. Finally, we conclude in Section 4. A trajectory is a set of piecewise linear functions, each of which maps from a disjoint trajectory as a set of n linear functions of the time variable t , one for each dimension, and the trajectory may change speed and direction at finitely many time instants. Each variable and coordinate variables. A trajectory is a disjunction of all its linear pieces. For example, a trajectory of the user moving on a 2-D space may consist of 3 linear pieces as shown below:
An object movement database D consists of a set of trajectories, one for each object. That is, i M i T D 1 = = X  , where M is the number of moving objects. Each linear example objects in a 2-dimensional space. Note that the trajectory of each object may time interval [8, 10). Definition 1. Given a group of objects G and a maximum distance threshold max_dis , we say objects in G are geographically close at a time point t if every pair of objects pair of objects in G whose distance is larger than max_dis . We also say objects in G is otherwise. min_dur , a time interval [ t , t + k ] is called a close interval of G if 1. objects in G are geographically close at any time point in [ t, t + k ], small positive number, small positive number, and 4. k  X  min_dur . A far interval can be similarly defined. pattern may have multiple close intervals and multiple far intervals, within which the geographical property associated with G is not clear. We quantify the significance of close subintervals of the undecided intervals. defined as: 
The weight represents the proportion of the time when users of P (are expected to) stay close. Thus, the larger is the weight, the more significant is the group pattern. is valid if the weight of P exceeds the threshold min_wei . 
The problem is how to identify all valid group patterns given a trajectory-based object movement database and the thresholds max_dis , min_dur , and min_wei . The geographical property of a mobile group (i.e., close or far) is determined by the distances between all pairs of objects at any time point. Here, the distance function of o and o 2 for each corresponding linear piece (i.e., with the same time interval) can be between time 0 and 3 are as follows: Location of object o 1 at time t : (1 + 3 t , 1 + t ) Location of object o 2 at time t : (2 + 2 t , 2 + t ) The Euclidean distance between o 1 and o 2 when 0  X  t &lt;3 is 2 ) 1 ( ) 1 ( 2 +  X  t
A complete distance function between o 1 and o 2 whose location data listed in Table 1 is the following: t group c k is named Group-Weight( c k ). Group-Weight( c k ) starts with synchronizing the linear pieces of the trajectory in each trajectory of c k such that each trajectory has the same set of time segments, followed by computing the close and far intervals in each limitation.
 within the context of mobile group pattern mining states that any sub-group pattern of a valid group patterns must also be valid. In [9], both AGP and VG-growth algorithms Apriori property still holds for trajectory-based movement data. Theorem 1. [Apriori property for group patterns] Given a database D and thresholds max_dis , min_dur , and min_wei , if a group pattern is valid, all of its subgroup patterns will also be valid. Trajectory-based Group Pattern Mining, abbreviated ATGP, whose pseudo-code is shown in Fig. 1. In the algorithm, we use C k to denote the set of candidate k-groups, ( C k =Generate_Candidate_Groups( G k -1 )), and the generated candidates are verified by computing their weights. Input: D , max_dis , min_dur , and min_wei
Output: all valid groups G 01 G =  X  ; G 1 =all distinct objects; 02 for ( k = 2; G k -1  X   X ; k ++) 03 C k = Generate_Candidate_Groups (G k -1 ); G k =  X  ; 04 for each candidate k -group c k  X  C k 05 c k . weight = Group-Weight ( c k , max_dis , min_dur ); 06 if ( c k . weight &gt;= min_wei } G k = G k  X  c k ; 07 G = G  X  G k ; 08 return G ; 
In [WL03], Wang et al. proposed a data structure VG-graph whose edges represent all valid 2-groups and an algorithm VG-growth that traverses VG-graph to identify all valid groups. We adapt VG-graph to work for trajectory-based object movement TVG-growth. Similar to VG-graph, the edges of TVG-graph are determined by the set of valid 2-groups. However, since each object may have some untraceable periods, every edge in TVG-graph is associated with a set of close intervals as well as another set of far intervals. The group mining procedure of TVG-growth remains the same as edge has to be updated as the recursive mining procedure proceeds [3]. In this paper, we reported a novel approach that discovers moving object group patterns from a database comprising trajectories of moving objects. Furthermore, our research allows non-continuous trajectories which model the disconnected behavior of moving objects. accurately determined or completely unknown . In some applications, location data of includes mining mobile group patterns by considering the inherent uncertainty of location data. 11. O. Wolfson, A. P. Sistla, S. Chamberlain, Y.
