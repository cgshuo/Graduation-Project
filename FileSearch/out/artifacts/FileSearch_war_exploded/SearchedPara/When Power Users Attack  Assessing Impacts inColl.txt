 Power users, in a Collaborative Filtering (CF) Recommender Sys-tem (RS) context, are those who can exert considerable influence over the recommendation outcomes presented to other users. RS operators encourage the existence of power user communities and leverage them to help fellow users make informed purchase deci-sions. Thus, RS research in this area has focused on power user identification and utilization to address challenges such as rating sparsity for new items or users. But, as ever, there remains the po-tential for corruption of power. Alongside accuracy and efficiency measures, RS robustness to manipulation or  X  X ttack X  has been stud-ied using injection of false user profiles. Our research is investigat-ing the impact on RS predictions and top-N recommendation lists when simulated power users provide biased ratings for new items. In this study, we introduce the notion of a  X  X ower User Attack X  for RS robustness analysis, as well as a novel use of social networking degree centrality concepts for identifying RS power users. Initial results show that power users identified using in-degree centrality, compared to other techniques, can be more influential as reflected by accuracy and robustness impacts before and after power user attacks.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval X  Information filtering Recommender Systems; Power User; Attacks; Evaluation
In a Collaborative Filtering (CF) Recommender System (RS) context, power users are those who can exert considerable influ-ence over the recommendations presented to other users. Previous research has indicated that power users can have major impacts on RS ratings predictions and top-N recommendations lists, especially when the underlying RS algorithms are neighborhood-based [10]. However, recommender system operators encourage the existence of power user communities; e.g., Amazon Vine TM invites the most trusted reviewers on Amazon to post opinions about new and pre-release items to help their fellow users make informed purchase decisions 1 . Furthermore, new items can sometimes pose significant market acceptance challenges to producers of goods and services; in order to address this issue, marketers may rely on the influence that power users have in recommending items to other users [4, 1]. And given the influence that power users can have over others, what happens when power users provide biased ratings for new items?
To address this issue, we investigate the identification/selection and attack impacts of RS power users. We define and study a novel  X  X ower User Attack X  as a set of power user profiles that influence the results presented to other users by providing biased ratings. This attack is distinct from previously studied types of RS attacks [12, 9, 11] (e.g.,  X  X andom X ,  X  X verage X ,  X  X andwagon X , etc.) that rely on a set of carefully configured false user profiles which are injected into the dataset to mount the attack. Power User Attack analyses rely critically on power user identification, so we develop and evaluate a novel use of degree centrality concepts from social network analysis [18], for identifying the most influential RS power users for attack purposes.

In this paper we develop hypotheses for, and present initial re-sults of, experiments designed to answer several questions related to RS power users and attacks on new items using power user pro-files: (1) How are power users best identified in a RS? (2) What happens to the accuracy and robustness of the RS rating predictions when power user profiles contain biased ratings for new items? (3) How do the popular RS algorithms compare in their robustness against power user attacks?
In the RS context, power users are of interest to system oper-ators and their client companies when launching a new item be-cause a positive endorsement (high rating) can translate into item recommendations to a large number of users. This is known as market-based use of RS and has been previously promoted as a solution to the  X  X old-start X  or  X  X ew item X  problem [1]. However, identifying power users remains an active research topic. Rashid et al [14] developed a RS algorithm-independent approach based on the number of unique prediction differences observed when an active user is removed from the prediction calculation. Viral mar-keting to exploit the network value of customers was studied by [4]. Maximizing the spread of influence through a social network was further studied by [8] who found the problem to be NP-hard and provided the first provable approximate guarantees for efficient algorithms. More recently, [5] has analyzed several heuristic ap-http://www.amazon.com/gp/vine/help proaches to power user selection. Power user selection techniques have been evaluated using various methods such as shifts in pre-diction values [14, 5], accuracy and coverage measures [1], and expected lift in profit [4]. Although robustness measures such as Hit Ratio and Rank (see Evaluation Metrics in  X 4) have not been used previously to evaluate power user selection methods, we use them here because we believe that true power users are in some sense defined by their capacity for impact on system outcomes.
Social Network Analysis affords well-known concepts that can be readily applied to RS power users and their influence in the un-derlying RS social graph. The concept of Degree Centrality [18] indicates that nodes (users) who have more edges (connections) to other nodes may have advantages; high in-degree refers to nodes that many other nodes connect to and corresponds to high promi-nence, prestige, or popularity and high out-degree refers to nodes that connect to many other nodes and corresponds to high expan-siveness. Furthermore, collaborative relationships in recommender systems can be represented as a social network [13], where, in-degree represents the number of contact lists a user appears in and out-degree indicates the number of users on a contact list that can be used to ask opinions or advice. Neighborhood characteristics and power user selection in recommender systems were analyzed in [10] as part of study on temporal social networks.

Attempts to influence recommender system results by providing false ratings are known as  X  X hilling attacks X  [9], or  X  X rofile injec-tion attacks X  [11]. A user profile contains the set of ratings a user has made using the recommender system. The intent of an attack is to either promote ( X  X ush X ) a target item by setting the rating to the maximum value or demote ( X  X uke X ) a target item by setting the rating to the minimum value; furthermore, attackers will sub-mit one or more user profiles containing item ratings (called attack user profiles) that push or nuke a specific item. Research in attacks on recommender systems began in 2002 [12] and has continued to be studied, especially in the areas of attack detection and im-provements in algorithm robustness; a more recent summary on RS attacks can be found in [2]. This research has revealed that knowl-edge of the underlying RS algorithms and dataset characteristics can enhance the effectiveness of an attack even though this knowl-edge may be difficult to obtain. With today X  X  level of user sophis-tication, however, attackers can obtain this knowledge either indi-rectly (e.g., scraping/data-mining, social engineering well-known users via side channels) or even directly (e.g., leak, insider, system breach). Uncovering, in part or full, the social network of interest that underlies such RS can leave systems vulnerable to exploitation from more subtle, yet powerful, attacks by highly-influential power users. And this vector of attack remains an open question in RS robustness research that we begin to explore in this study.
We define the Power User Attack (PUA) as a new attack model where power users bias the results of the RS predictions and top-N recommendation lists with targeted fake ratings. Like other attack models, PUA profiles contain target items that are set to the max-imum or minimum rating depending on attack intent. However, unlike classic attack models (e.g., random, average, bandwagon) that employ straightforward statistical templates (e.g., average rat-ing, popularity, and likability) to generate synthetic attack profile filler (non-target) items [11], very little is known about the profile characteristics of power users. And without this knowledge, it is difficult to generate synthetic power user profiles. So, in order to evaluate this attack model, our initial foray into studying the impact of a PUA uses selected power user profiles that already exist in the dataset as simulated injected attack user profiles; we recognize this as a limitation in our initial work and will be addressed in the fu-ture with the use of synthetic power user attack profiles. Thus, to implement our initial attack, a group of power users are selected (see  X 3.1), the attack intent and target item(s) are specified, and the remainder of the profile for the PUA (the filler) remains unchanged for each power user in the attack. By keeping the power users X  pro-files the same and then adding the target item rating for the attack, the power users X  connections to other users, from a social network standpoint, remain essentially the same 2 . The number of power users participating in the attack defines the attack size; the larger the attack size, the larger the expected disruption in RS predictions and top-N recommendation lists.
Power users in the RS context have been referred to as users with a large number of ratings [7] as well as those that are able to influ-ence the largest number of other users [4, 14, 1, 5]. To measure influence, [14] used the number of prediction differences above a prediction threshold when a user is removed from the dataset, [5] used the number of users that had the prediction for a target item shifted sufficiently above a threshold so that the item appears in their top-N list, [1] used MAE and coverage to evaluate various seed (influential user) selection algorithms, and [4] used the ex-pected lift in profit earned by influencing other users, recursively. Although maximizing the spread of influence through a social net-work is an NP-hard problem to solve optimally [8], several heuris-tics were analyzed by [5] in order to select groups of influential users including Most Central (those with highest aggregate simi-larity to other users), Most Positive (those with the highest posi-tive average rating), Most Active (those who have rated the highest number of items), and Random (a control group comprised of ran-domly selected users).

We have developed an approach to power user selection for at-tack purposes, based on social network analysis concepts of De-gree Centrality [18, 10]. Specifically, we use In-Degree Centrality (users who appear in the highest number of other users X  neighbor-hoods) with significance weighting [6] because when using simi-larity and neighborhood-based methods to select power users, sig-nificance weighting encourages strong connections between users who have rated many items in common. In an initial study, we found that both our approach and the Most Central heuristic [5] performed significantly better using significance weighting.
To address our research questions we test the following Hypothe-ses: (1) Using Degree Centrality to select a set of power users re-sults in a more effective attack than using either Aggregated Sim-ilarity or Number of Ratings, (2) A small number of power users can have significant effects on RS predictions and top-N lists of recommendations for new items, and (3) User-based CF is more vulnerable to the power user attack than item-based CF algorithms.
Evaluation Metrics : We use Mean Absolute Error and predic-tion coverage for accuracy and coverage [7, 17] using a holdout-partitioned 70/30 train/test dataset. We also use Hit Ratio, Predic-tion Shift, and Rank robustness measures [11, 2] where a high Hit Ratio and a low Rank indicates that the attack was successful (from the attacker X  X  standpoint). Since the PUA being evaluated here is for new items (zero rating value), the Prediction Shift is expected to be close to the maximum rating as defined by the RS.
In a few cases, power user profiles that already had a target item rating were updated in certain attack scenarios and, although the target item rating change might alter their neighborhoods, we be-lieve the impact to this initial analysis is not an issue. Datasets and Algorithms : The data used in this study were the MovieLens 3 100K 4 and 1M 5 datasets, with item ratings from 1 (did not like) to 5 (liked very much). For the user-based CF algorithm [15, 6, 3], we used Pearson Correlation similarity (with significance weighting of n ci / 50 , where n ci is the number of co-rated items), Neighborhood formation (similarity thresholding = 0.0 and kNN = 25 and 50), and Mean-centered prediction. For the item-based CF algorithm [16], we used Adjusted Cosine similarity (with signif-icance weighting of n ci / 50 ), Neighborhood formation (similarity thresholding = 0.0), and Weighted prediction. Following earlier studies evaluating power user influence [4, 14, 5], we focus on tra-ditional user-based and item-based CF algorithms for this analysis. We plan to use matrix factorization approaches as a next step. Power User Selection : The following methods were used: InDegree (ID2550 and ID5050): Our method is based on the in-degree centrality concept from social network analysis  X  power users are those who participate in the highest number of neighbor-hoods. For each user i compute its similarity with every other user j applying significance weighting n ci / 50 , then discard all but the top-n neighbors for each user i (we used n=25 for ID2550 and n=50 for ID5050). Count the number of similarity scores for each user j (# neighborhoods user j is in) and select the top 50 user j  X  X . AggregatedSimilarity (AS25NO): This is the Most Central heuris-tic from [5]. The top 50 users with the highest aggregate similarity scores become the selected set of power users. This method re-quires at least 5 co-rated items between user i and user j and does not use significance weighting 6 .
 NumberRatings (NR): This method is based on [7] where  X  X ower user X  refers to users with the highest number of ratings; it also is called the Most Active heuristic in [5]. We selected the top 50 users based on the total number of ratings they have in their user profile.
Target Item Selection : For each dataset, 50 target items with no more than one rating, regardless of their rating value, were selected randomly, given our objective to attack only  X  X ew X  items.
Attack Parameter Selection : The Attack Intent is Push, i.e., tar-get item rating is set to max (= 5). The Attack Size or number of power users in each attack is 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5, 3, and 2; 50 power user profiles equate to a 5% attack for ML100K and a 1% attack for ML1M. The Attack profiles used were actual power user profiles and we added the target item rating. The Filler size is determined by each power users X  profile size.

Test Variations : Two prediction algorithms, two datasets, four power user selection methods, and eight attack sizes. Each test variation was executed once for each of the 50 target items and data results were averaged over the 50 target items. (1) How are power users best identified in a RS? How much in-fluence power users can exert on other users, before and after an attack, would indicate the best identification method. Before the power user attack , one measure of influence is the negative im-pact on RS accuracy when removing power users. We removed from 1 to 50 power users from datasets of user-item ratings before any attacks took place for all three methods of power user selection. The results for InDegree (Figure 1) show that as power users are removed, accuracy impacts are more significant on user-based rec-ommenders ( p &lt; 0.001 when the number of power users removed is &gt; 10) than on item-based recommenders ( p &lt; 0.025 when the http://www.grouplens.org 100,000 ratings, 1,682 movies, 943 users, 93.7% sparsity. 1,000,209 ratings, 3,883 movies, 6,040 users, 95.7% sparsity.
Based on personal communication with the authors. number of power users removed is = 30) across both dataset sizes. Similar (ML1M) and weaker (ML100K) results occurred for Ag-gregatedSimlarity and NumberRatings methods. Coverage results (not shown) also indicate significant impacts as more power users are removed, especially for user-based CF. The accuracy and cov-erage results for the InDegree method and user-based CF are con-sistent with results found in [10]. After the attack , we believe that the method that selects the most influential set of power users is the one producing the highest Hit Ratio and lowest Rank. Both InDe-gree and NumberRatings power user selection methods dominated (attack was more successful) the AggregatedSimilarity method as indicated by the Average Hit Ratio and Rank results for user-based CF using ML1M (Figure 2). While Hit Ratio and Rank results for InDegree and NumberRatings were about the same for ML100K (not shown), InDegree performed better than NumberRatings on the ML1M dataset (p &lt; 0.05). For item-based CF, none of the power user selection methods tested here produced a major impact to Hit Ratio or Rank using ML1M (Figure 3) or ML100K. From the at-tacker X  X  perspective, the AggregatedSimilarity method was slightly more effective than InDegree and NumberRatings.

Therefore, using In Degree Centrality to select a set of power users results in a more effective attack than using either Aggregated Similarity or Number of Ratings, confirming our first Hypothesis for user-based CF only. Impacts to the accuracy metrics (Figure 1) and robustness metrics (Figure 2) indicate that a small number of power users 7 can have significant effects on RS predictions and top-N recommendation lists for new items, confirming our second Hypothesis for user-based CF only.
 Figure 1: MAE impacts, before and after removing Power Users  X  In Degree using ML100K and ML1M (2) What happens to the accuracy and robustness of the RS rating predictions when power user profiles contain biased ratings for new items? Accuracy and robustness metrics were negatively impacted due to the PUA. Accuracy results were mixed across datasets, CF algorithms, selection methods, and size of attack. Notably after at-tack, all four selection methods yielded MAE values significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.05) for ML1M user-based CF and 30 or more power users, and the InDegree method yielded MAE values significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.05) for ML1M item-based CF with 30 or 40 power users. As noted above, robustness results (Figures 2 and 3) indicate that InDegree and NumberRatings impact user-based CF recom-menders more significantly than AggregatedSimilarity; however, we found the reverse to be true for item-based CF recommenders. (3) How do the popular RS algorithms (user-based and item based CF) compare in their robustness against power user attacks?
Note that 50 power users is &lt; 1% of the ML1M user base. User-based CF is significantly more vulnerable to the power user attack than Item-based CF, confirming our third Hypothesis, and is also consistent with previous findings [9, 11, 2] because the PUA, like the random and average attacks, are able to exploit the sim-ilarity between the attackers and non-attackers to favor the target item. For item-based CF, the AggregatedSimilarity method pro-duced a more effective set of power users for the attack as compared to InDegree and NumberRatings across both datasets (ID5050 and AS25NO Hit Ratio difference was significant at p &lt; 0.001 for ML1M); however, the impact of the attack was weak, i.e. relatively low Hit Ratio and high Rank, compared to user-based CF.
Power users are important to recommender systems and con-tribute to their improved prediction accuracy; however, we have found that power user attacks can be effective against recommender systems. In this initial study, we have shown that a relatively small number of power users can have significant effects on RS predic-tions and top-N recommendation lists for new items. We have also shown that the InDegree method of power user selection produces a set of power users that are able to mount more effective attacks than the AggregatedSimilarity and NumberRatings methods.
Our contributions have been to provide a novel attack model called Power User Attack and to evaluate a novel use of a social network analysis method for selecting top-k influential power users for attack purposes. To further strengthen our work, in the future we plan to research the use of (1) power user profile characteristics to enable us to build synthetic power user attack profiles to formally mount the PUA, (2) other RS algorithms, such as SVD, (3) target items other than new items, and (4) other domains/datasets.
