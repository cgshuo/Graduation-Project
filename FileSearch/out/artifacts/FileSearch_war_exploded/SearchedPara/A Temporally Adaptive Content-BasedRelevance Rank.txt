 In information retrieval relevance ranking of the results is one of the most important single tasks there are. There are many different ranking algorithms based on the content of the documents or on some external properties e.g. link structure of html documents.

We present a temporally adaptive content-based relevance ranking algorithm that explicitly takes into account the tem-poral behavior of the underlying statistical properties of the documents in the form of a statistical topic model. Further-more we state that our algorithm can be used on top of any ranking algorithm.

In information retrieval relevance ranking of the results is one of the most important single tasks there is. There are many different ranking algorithms based on the content of the documents or on some external properties e.g. link structure of html documents i.e. PageRank [4]. There are also methods that implicitly take into account the temporal dimension of the data.

For certain domains e.g. online newspapers the time as-pect becomes more important. Static ranking algorithms are not that desirable as users are likely to search news related to the current issues and perhaps some background infor-mation that is still related to the current news. This means that the relevance of documents is not static over time for even exactly the same queries. To further emphasize this one can state that this holds even for static corpora as long as the outside world is not static. Nevertheless simply promot-ing new articles in the ranking may not produce desirable results either as related older articles may be relevant too.
Temporal adaptation is desired. We automatically detect topical trends within the corpus and use these trends as basis for the adaptation within the algorithm. This kind of where K ( t ) is the set of indices of  X  K strongest topics in the model at time t . c M ( t ) k is the strength of topic k in the model at time t and c D k is the strength of topic k in document D , both of them are normalized and thus proper probabilities.
We tested our algorithm using real data from a Finnish fi-nancial newspaper Kauppalehti 1 . We used a 100 component MPCA model with temporal resolution of one month.
First we performed series of queries using Eq. 2 with dif-ferent values of  X  K at different time points. This was done in order to understand how the number of components for adaptation affects the results. To make it easier to compare the results between different and identical queries at differ-ent time points we only accepted query results up to the date of the earlier query and no documents dated more recent. That setting is not completely realistic but it illustrates the effect of the adaptive ranking better. For each query we con-sidered the top 500 results as the typical number of results were around 3000. Figure 1 shows the behavior of query results for two identical queries when performed 12 months apart. Figure 1: Three difference measures for the results o fa query that was per formed twice at two different time points using different values of  X  K .

We also performed a small scale experiment to investigate the precision of query results using both Eqs. 1 and 2. The difficulty with this is that there is no corpus available with time dependent queries and relevance decisions. We used the same corpus and model as with the other experiments. The query results were judged relevant or irrelevant by hu-man evaluators and we only considered the precision within the top 30 ranked documents. Figure 2 shows an example of precision for tf-idf-and adaptive ranking with 3and 9 components for adaptation. Based on our preliminary ex-periments we were able to do following observations. http://www.ka uppalehti.fi/
