 The realization of human-computer interaction in natural language represents a major challenge in the context of aligning Romania to existing tech-nologies. 
The proposed project aims to introduce the se-mantic frames and contex ts, which define a con-cept X  X  sense according to its facultative or mandatory valences (Baker and Fillmore, 1998), to Romanian NLP systems. The behavior of the Ro-manian clauses  X  mainly the verbal group, around which all the other sentence complements gravi-tates in a (more or less) specific order  X  has been closely debated in the last years (Irimia, 1997; Do-brovie-Sorin, 1994; Monachesi, 1998; Barbu, 1999), creating a proper frame for the introduction of semantic roles. 
This paper presents the steps considered for the achievement of this project. Thus, Section 2 gives a very brief description of the frame semantics, and Section 3 presents the realization of a semantic structures database for the Romanian language, similar to those existing for English, German, or Spanish, containing detailed information about the relations between the semantic meaning and the syntax of the words. In the last section, some pos-sible applications of the detection of semantic roles to written and spoken texts are mentioned (ques-tion answering systems, summarization systems, prosody prediction systems), before drawing some final conclusions. The FrameNet (FN) lexical-semantic resource is based on the principles of Frame Semantics (FS). From FS point of view, the semantic/syntactic fea-tures of  X  predicational words  X  1 (Curteanu, 2003-2004) are defined in a particular semantic frame. The sentences are schematic representations of different situations, including different partici-pants, objects or other conceptual roles. Being a linguistically transposed experience, a sentence represents an event scenario that is structured around a semantic head. The meaning of this head can be understood only by expressing the core frame elements and can, optionally, be enriched with other semantic features, by expressing some non-core frame elements. 
Fillmore (1968) divides the language representa-tion into two structures: Surface Structure (the syn-tactic knowledge) and Deep Structure (the semantic knowledge). The language process begins at the Deep Structure level with a non-verbal rep-resentation (an idea or a thought) and ends in the Surface Structure, as we express ourselves. 
The Case Notions are representations at a se-mantic level of the lexical arguments. This inven-tory of cases comprises universal concepts, possible innate, sufficient for the classification of the verbs of a language and reusable in all lan-guages. The list of Fillmore Cases, which will be considered for the project, includes: Agent, In-strument, Dative, Experiencer, Locative, Object, etc. The first step in the realization of the Romanian corpus of annotated semantic frames was the man-ual translation of 110 randomly selected sentences from the English FN. In order to align the Roma-nian version with the English one, a larger corpus was needed, so the translation continued with the Event frame, summing up to 1094 sentences. This frame was selected due to its rich frame to frame relations (Inheritance  X  Change_of_consistency, Process_start, etc ., Subframe -Change_of_state_ scenario and Using -Process_end ). After the se-lection of the clauses and their translation, the Ro-manian sentences were aligned with the English ones using the aligner developed by the Institute of Research in Artificial Intelligence (Tufi  X  et al., 2005). The next step was the automatic import of the English annotation, followed by a manual veri-fication, a detection of the mismatching cases and an optimization process which, based on inference rules, corrects the automatic annotation. 3.1 Automatic annotation import The intuition behind the importing program (Trandab  X  X  et al., 2005) is that most of the frames defined in the English FN are likely to be valid cross-linguistically, becau se semantic frames ex-press conceptual structures, language independent at the deep structure level. The surface realization is realized according to each language syntactic constraints. 
The automatic importing program is based on the correlation of the semantic roles expressed in English with the translation equivalents in Roma-nian of the words that r ealize a specific role. The automatic import is manually checked in order to establish the method efficiency. 3.2 The algorithm The starting point for the German, Japanese and Spanish FN creation was the manual annotation at FE level of existing corpora for each language. For Romanian, I propose creating a corpus of semantic roles starting from the translation of (a part of) the English corpus of annotated sentences (see Figure 1). 
Using the XML files of the annotated English sentences, and the alignment files where each Eng-lish word is linked to its corresponding Romanian translation, I automatically created a set of XML files containing a corpus of FE annotated sentences for the Romanian language. An example of im-ported annotation for the English lexical unit  X  X c-cur X  is presented in figure 2. 
The &lt; annotationSet &gt; tag indicates that a new sen-tence is annotated. Inside this tag, the &lt;layers&gt; tag sets the annotation layer (FE -Frame Element, GF -Grammatical Function or PT -Phrase Type) and the &lt; sentence &gt; tag encloses the text. The labels are applied to the words in &lt;text&gt; , indexed by their character. For example, the tag: indicates that the Event frame element is starting with the first character of the sentence an stops at the 9 th , meaning that the Event FE corresponds to  X  Incidentul  X  (en. The incident ). 
The general algorithm of the automatic import-ing program focuses on: 
For example, the lexical unit  X  X ccur.v X  will ap-pear in English and Romanian annotated as: 3.3 Optimization My initial experiment has involved the translation of approx. 1000 sentences from English FN. The translations have been realized by professional translators, so the errors propagated in the corpus should be minimal. The reported problems during the translation relate mainly to the lack of the con-text of English sentences, which generate different translation variants. However, if the English se-mantic frame is considered, this problem is sur-mountable. 
The alignment process was performed with the aligner developed by the Institute of Research in Artificial Intelligence (Tufi  X  , 2005), which is con-sidered to have a precision of 87.17% and a recall of 70.25%. However, the aligner results were manually validated before entering the annotation import program. 
The assessment of the correctitude of the ob-tained Romanian corpus is preformed manually. The first results of the annotation import show an overall accuracy of approx. 80%. The validation focuses on detecting the cases where the import has failed, trying to discover if the problems are due to the translation or to the semantic or syntac-tic specificities of Romanian. Only few translation errors were found, and even then, the meaning has been kept and the semantic roles were correctly assigned. However, there were cases where the FEs are expressed in English, but are implicit in the Romanian translation, as in: or not-expressed in English, but expressed in Ro-manian, as the Protagonist role in : The frame generation program based on the gener-ated Romanian corpus is currently under develop-ment. 
In this paper, I have presented a fast method for the realization of a Romanian corpus annotated with semantic frame relations. The main purpose of creating a quick semantic annotated database is using it as training corpus for automatic labeled semantic frames detection. Nowadays, expensive linguistic resources demanding a lot of time, money and human resources are created for differ-ent languages. After their utility is proved, those resources begin to be im ported to other languages (see for instance the MultiSemCor project 2 ). In this context, the realization of a Romanian FN is a challenging project in the frame of Romance FN. 
The import method was preferred to the  X  X lassi-cal X  creation by hand of a manually annotated cor-pus because of its possible automation. I investigate currently the possibility of using a translation engine for the most time consuming task, namely the translation of the English sen-tences. The project will be further developed by adding to the automatic import program rules dis-covered though the analysis of the mismatching cases. 
The lack of semantic information was very ob-vious while working on the QA@CLEF competi-tion 3 (Question Answering task within the Cross Language Evaluation Forum Competition) last year (Pu  X  ca  X  u et al., 2006); having the semantic frames database (thus a semi-automatic role label-ing system) can improve the precision of selecting an appropriate snippet for the desired answer, not to mention also the benefits for answer generation. Another application of the semantic frames I am interested in is prosody prediction. Within the In-stitute of Computer Science, I have begin to work at a syntax-prosody inte rface for Romanian based on FDG trees of sentences and other syntactical information to discover the phonological entities underlying the written text and the topic/focus ar-ticulation. The algorithm for finding sentence fo-cus uses the semantic ro les as a main component.
