 1. Introduction
Information science has long recognized the contribution of subjective, affective or emotional aspects in user X  X  assessments of specific information objects retrieved from an information system (e.g., Borlund, intertwined with user-specific subjectivity.

There is an increased research emphasis on the measures of affective reaction across multiple disciplines 2005 ). This paper introduces an approach to instant measurement of document evaluation in information ( Fischhoff, 2000 ), and as potential proxies for instant utility. 1.1. Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) gest the use of monetary units for determining the value of retrieved documents, with positive monetary amounts assigned to good documents and negative amounts assigned when users would rather avoid encoun-ter with a document. According to Cooper, system utility may thereby be gauged by summing both positive and negative amounts users assign to individual documents.

We expected that participants X  attempts to answer the following questions: What reasons did participants provide for assigning WTP and EU values?
Based on these reasons, what do WTP and EU measure in the context of website evaluations? 3. An informal study of usability
The data were collected over the six-month period. Participation in the study was voluntary and anony-mous. The study was advertised through the mailing lists of the School of Library and Information Science ety for Information Science 2005 annual meeting.

Thirty-two ( N = 32) participants evaluated the websites by assigning WTP and EU values, thirty out of the failed to evaluate the websites. Table 1 provides demographic information about the participants and their web use history.

When participants linked to the experimental site they saw the nine links to the selected sites with brief or scanned the document, and then returned to the experimental page to make their evaluations before pro-ceeding to the next website.

WTP was collected by asking participants to enter in a textbox the dollar amount they would be willing to where users were asked to explain the reason behind their WTP value.

Each slide-bar for soliciting EU was also associated with the larger textbox where users could input their reasons for the selected EU value.

After reviewing and rating the documents, users went to the next page where they entered the answer to the cussed in this paper and are excluded from the presented analysis. 4. WTP and EU X  X reliminary results 4.1. Statistical analysis
Participants were free to assign any dollar amount they wished in evaluating documents using the WTP measure. The values assigned across participants ranged between  X 100. Participants varied considerably in the WTP values were subsequently normalized on a scale ranging between [ 1,+1] with a mean of 0.
The positive and negative ends of the bar were defined as  X 1. Thus, the EU values were already normalized because of the standardized scale.

Across the participants X  responses, the WTP and EU values were statistically significantly correlated with answer and documents without the answer to the question regarding Howard Hughes.

We now discuss clusters that emerged from the 33 themes identified in participants X  accounts. Most of the ters: style-related, usefulness, interest, ambiguous, thoroughness, and reliability.

We now describe six clusters in the order of their frequencies in WTP and EU comments.

In EU-related comments, the usefulness cluster accounts for only 14.1% of all responses.

 Thoroughness was ranked third of the WTP responses (12.9%) and fifth in the EU theme clusters (10.9%). Ambiguous comments and reliability clusters had comparable ratios and shared the same ranking in WTP and
EU comments (forth and sixth rank respectively). 5. Discussion
The usability study gathered data on participants X  reasons for assigning WTP and EU values to evaluated documents. Those data permitted use to examine research questions posited above and provided insight into the nature of WTP and EU measures in the context of website evaluations. 5.1. Participants X  reasons for assigning WTP and EU values
Results found that participants provided 15% more comments when explaining the WTP values ( n = 294) than the EU values ( n = 256).
 The most frequently mentioned reason for assigning WTP values was document usefulness (33.3% of all the
WTP comments), followed by style (26.2%), thoroughness (12.9%), ambiguous comments (12.9%), interest (7.5%) and reliability (7.1%).

The most frequently mentioned reason for assigning EU values was document style (37.9%), followed by interest (18.8%), usefulness (14.1%), ambiguous comments (12.1%), thoroughness (10.9%), and reliability (6.3%).

The ratio of proportions of user comments associated with the usefulness and interest theme clusters showed the greatest overall difference between WTP and EU ratings (see Table 5 ). Comments associated with ratios).

The ratio of proportions for the four remaining theme clusters showed style-related comments reported among the WTP and EU ratings. These results add to our understanding of differences between WTP and EU as measures of subjective document value. 5.2. Nature of WTP and EU measures
Based on existing literature ( Cooper, 1973a; Kahneman et al., 2000 ), WTP and EU were initially viewed as assigning WTP and EU values in this study shows clear distinctions between these measures. WTP and EU true for comments coded as ambiguous. However, comments related to a document X  X  perceived interest and its usefulness differed significantly between WTP and EU. WTP values are most strongly associated with useful-ness comments, while EU values are most strongly associated with interest comments. This suggests that WTP evaluation of documents reflects the instrumental-rational value that an information object has in problem not, without reference to its potential as a tool.

Thus, it can be argued that WTP and EU represent two parts of the evaluative construct that includes and is prompted by asking to assign a monetary value (WTP) to a document. The emotional aspect is linked about a document (EU). Participants X  ability to assign both types of values to the same documents suggests information seekers place more value on documents X  ability to answer a question, with WTP then an appro-the emotional reactions a document triggers, with EU then better measuring document value. Future studies measures for studying information evaluation.
 of the study include: Participants were not tested for the prior knowledge of the subject. Participants X  prior knowledge about Howard Hughes biography might have had an impact on their evaluations.

Experimental design did not accommodate randomization of the presented websites or participants; future studies should incorporate variables randomization in design.

The two measures were solicited simultaneously because of the initial assumption that they both measured subjective worth. Future studies might solicit WTP and EU values through different instruments/groups of participants.

While a post-test was initially planned, it was never implemented due to logistical difficulties; balanced design is recommended for future studies to achieve greater reliability.
 by variance in equipment (computer, mouse, touch pad, the Web browser).

Participants continued evaluations even after the correct answer was found. Future analysis might include vide evaluations only when the correct answer is found.
 Although the reported results were based on data from an obviously superficial search task, the WTP and the types of reasons they offered through their comments about the specific value they assigned a document during the search process. 6. Conclusion WTP and EU were statistically significantly correlated. However, the unexplained variance between the two ilarities and differences in what WTP and EU measures.

Analysis of participants X  accounts for assigning the two measures suggested that WTP reflects the rational value of an object in completing the task and EU reflects emotional, task-neutral reaction to the document
WTP and EU measures can be used simultaneously for identifying parameters of information objects that affect user choices. WTP and EU provide evidence for discriminating between  X  X  X ood X  X  and  X  X  X ad X  X  documents example, WTP might be more appropriate for evaluations where accuracy, relevance, and other aspects of a document or a system are important in helping a user to resolve his/her information need. EU might be more important for a user.

The two measures offer insight into human information seeking and valuation behavior patterns, and a bridge towards understanding the relationship between perceived and objective information value measures.
Our experimental measures of WTP and EU have opened a window into the affective factors guiding user judgments about value of information and its usefulness to their needs. Kahneman and his colleagues have rience when the results of these measures are compared with recall-based reports of subjective experience, whether obtained through survey or interview. His work and that of many others raises serious questions standing of subjective experience and value. For information science, this point would seem to have clear methodological relevance for choices among relevance measures designed to assess the personal value a doc-ument holds for its user.

Further development and testing of the approach and measures for their potential use in information perceptions of documents in internet searches that yield large and multiple document lists in real world situations.
