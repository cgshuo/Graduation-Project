 Cancer is a common disease condition as it has been reported in most of the regions in the world. Different features such as tumor size, age, number of genomic alt erations and non -synonymous mutations etc. have been considered in diagnosing and treating cancer patients (eg: precision cancer prognosis) and it is known that early detection and treatment helps in preventing the spread of cancer.

Several efforts have be en reported analyzing the clinical data of cancer patients in the past [1] [2]. As the databases have significant amounts of records, analysis of the relationships among different features or risk factors of different types of cancer may further help in di agnosing and predicting the disease at early stage of cancer. Machine learning techniques provide a perfect platform to analyze them in differently and find some relationships and patterns among their clinical data [1] [3]. Regression analysis is one parti cular machine learning technique, which could be perfectly utilized with independent factors and dependant factors of particular datasets to be analyzed in order to identify and characterize relationships between multiple risk factors of cancer [4] [5] [6] .

Regression analysis is a technique, which can be utilized in analyzing relationships among dependant and independent features of cancer patients and the results of this analysis can further be utilized in diagnosis and prognosis of cancer patients.

In th is paper, we have used three datasets of cancer patients to identify the relationships among their clinical datasets using simple and multiple regression analysis as the machine learning technique. The results show that the insights of relationships among the clinical features of patients can be seen by regression approach and they may be useful in diagnosis and treatments of cancer. 1 . 1 Problem Formulation It is an essential requirement to identify relationships among clinical risk factors as it may provide i nsights into identify and characterize the disease quickly and it may further support in diagnosing and treating cancer patients. Further, there exist clinical databases of cancer patients and they still require a proper analysis. Therefore, filling up the existing gaps of analysis has to be carried out by the computer scientist or engineers. Regression analysis has been utilized as a powerful machine learning technique for analyzing relationships between dependant and independent features of clinical data of patients in the past and it would further be helpful in diagnosis of cancer patients. 1 . 2 Review of the Relevant Literature The research carried out by Ghim et. al. [1] was designed to find proper values for weights in the classifiers and they then quantify the relative importance of factors or features in the classifier. In this work, different classifiers such as k -nearest neighbor, support vector machine, random forest, neural networks and logistic regression were used to classify the prognostic risk int o three categories: high, low and intermediate. Molecular data (The Cancer Genome Atlas/ TCGA) and clinical utility are combined systematically to profile tumors in order to management of cancer by Yuan et al. in 2014 [2]. Cox model and Random Survival For est (RSF) were utilized in this analysis for four TCGA cancer types (kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma). In this study, it was possible to reveal potential prognos tic and/or therapeutic relevance across these multiple cancer types.

Cancer is a common disease condition as it has been reported in most of the regions in the world. Different features such as tumor size, age, number of genomic alterations and non -synony mous mutations etc. have been considered in diagnosing and treating cancer patients (eg: precision cancer prognosis) and it is known that early detection and treatment helps in preventing the spread of cancer.

Yusuff et al. has identified risk factors of b reast cancer by using logistic regression cross tabulation for the extracted data of breast cancer patients during the observations of radiologists [4]. Simple and multiple linear regression analysis for clinical datasets was explained by Richard et al. in 2003 [5]. They have further provided clinical examples and analyzed the usage of logistic regression in journals [5]. Astrid et al. showed how linear regression could be applied in medicine with dependant variables (continuous) and independent variables ( discrete or continuous) [6]. It further uses scatter plots to identify linearity or non -linearity of relationships among continuous variables [6]. Simple and multiple linear regression techniques were applied for analyzing clinical data to figure out the relationships between clinical features such as age, overall survival months, percent aneuploidy in merged cohort of Lower Grade Glioma and Glioblastoma brain tumor patients, age, overall survival months, bone marrow blast percentage of Acute Myelo id Leukemia patients and age, overall survival months of breast cancer patients. 2 . 1 Data Analysis Clinical datasets were extracted from cBioPortal databa se of patients for three cancer types: merged cohort of Lower Grade Glioma and Glioblastoma brain tumor ( 1122 observations), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (200 observations) and breast cancet (627 observations) and applied the regression techniques as follows.
 Simple linear regression was applied for features of merged cohort of Lower Grade Glioma and Glioblastoma brain tumor dataset where age was chosen as the independent variable (discrete) and overall survival months was the dependant variable (continuous). Furthermore the same technique was applied for breast cancer dataset where the same features were chosen a s independent and dependant variables.
 Multiple linear regression was applied for features of merged cohort of Lower Grade Glioma and Glioblastoma brain tumor dataset where age (discrete) and overall survival months (continuous) were chosen as the independ ent variables and percent aneuploidy was the dependant variable (continuous). The same technique was then applied for features of Acute Myeloid Leukemia where age (discrete) and bone marrow blast percentage (discrete) were chosen as the independent variabl es and overall survival months was the dependant variable (continuous).
 A significant (p -value &lt; 0.05) relationship could be observed among overall survival months and age (p -value = 0.0037682) after applying simple linear regression (Figure 1.). Here the estimated co -efficient is -0.10352 and it shows the size of the effect that age (independent) is having on overall survival months (dependent). The negative sign on the coefficient gives the direction of the effect. However, no significant relationship can be observed in the breast cancer dataset (p -value = 0.50896).

As p -values for the second indepen dent variables (overall survival months in brain cancer patients and bone marrow blast percentage in leukemia patients) are not significant in both cases (0.37311 and 0.6022) they may be removed from the model. Therefore, a significant relationship could b e observed in merged cohort of Lower Grade Glioma and Glioblastoma brain tumor dataset among percent aneuploidy and age (Figure 2.). Here the estimated positive, co -efficient is 0.0014159 and it shows the size of the effect that age (independent) is having on percent aneuploidy (dependent). A significant relationship could be seen in Acute Myeloid Leukemia dataset among overall survival months and age (Figure 3.). Here the estimated positive, co -efficient is 0.6495 and it shows the size of the effect that a ge (independent) is having on overall survival months (dependent). A negative relationship can be seen among overall survival months and age of Lower Grade Glioma and Glioblastoma brain tumor patients. The relationship between the percent aneup loidy and age is positive in Lower Grade Glioma and Glioblastoma brain tumor patients. Further a positive relationship can be seen among overall survival months and age of Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients.
