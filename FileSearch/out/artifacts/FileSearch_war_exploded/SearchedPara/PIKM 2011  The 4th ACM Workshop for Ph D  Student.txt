 The PIKM workshop gives Ph.D. students an opportunity to present their dissertation proposals at a global stage. Simi-larly to the CIKM, the PIKM workshop covers a wide range of topics in the areas of databases, information retrieval and knowledge management. Interdisciplinary work across these tracks is particularly encouraged.

The goal of this workshop is two-fold: First, it shall give doctoral students an opportunity to present their work in an early stage to a global audience. This allows the students not only to crystallize their ideas into a scientific article, and to practice scientific presentation, but also to receive feedback from reviewers, from fellow students and from the general CIKM audience. Second, we believe that the research com-munity, too, benefits from such a workshop: Ph.D. theses are the grassroots of research. They point out new research avenues and indicate current promising topics. They provide fresh viewpoints from the researchers of tomorrow. We hope that the interaction with other researchers at the workshop itself, across all levels of seniority, will help propel science forward.
 research directions. Based on our experience with previous PIKMs, other participants attending the workshop are likely to be professors, research scientists and professionals from the corporate world. The PIKM workshop allows them to get a panoramic view of the doctoral work pursued at vari-ous universities. Keynote Speaker. Professor Felix Naumann from the Hasso-Plattner-Institut, Potsdam, Germany, is the keynote speaker at PIKM 2011. He will talk about Extreme Web Data Integration  X  a task that becomes ever more challeng-ing with the relentless growth of the Web.
 Best Paper Award. The best paper at the PIKM work-shop, as determined by the reviews of the PC members, always receives a best paper award. This year X  X  award will go to Minsuk Kahng, Sangkeun Lee and Sang-Goo Lee for their paper Ranking Objects by Following Paths in Entity-Relationship Graphs [6]. The paper outlines a challenging vision for treating different types of data in a homogeneous, Semantic Web-like fashion for query answering. Thereby, it bridges the areas of databases and information retrieval. Review Article. We plan to write a review article that summarizes the proceedings of the PIKM 2011. Such arti-cles have been published before, in SIGIR Forum , SIGKDD Explorations ,and SIGMOD Record for the PIKM 2007 [16], PIKM 2008 [14], and PIKM 2010 [10] workshops respec-tively. PIKM 2011 has a steering committee with three former PIKM chairs: Jian Pei (Simon Fraser University, Canada), Prasan Roy (IBM Research, India), and Aparna S. Varde (Montclair State University, USA).

We would like to thank our PC members for the tremen-dous effort in completing the reviews in a short period of time.
