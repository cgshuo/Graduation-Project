A step towards the protection of privacy is to remove personal identi credit card numbers, before data is released. However, such a protection is insuf recoded as b [20,29] , 100** N and are no longer distinguishable from each other.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 ,wede 2. Functional (  X  ,  X  )-diversity
Let A be the set of attributes of data tables, consisting of two disjoint subsets, quasi-identi any data tuple t , t [ QI ] and t [ SA ] denote its QI and SA, respectively. Each attribute A has a taxonomy T A de fi ned as a tree structure. Leaf nodes of T it is a general tuple .

De fi nition 5. (Generalization) Let v and v  X  be two values of an attribute. We say that v covers v or v is an ancestor of v  X  in the taxonomy. Let t 1 and t t [ S ]  X  t 2 [ S ] (or t 1  X  t 2 if S = A ), if for each attribute A

Next, let us compare the strength of (  X  , u )-diversity and ( c , requirement that is stronger than a given (  X  , u )-diversity requirement if both c and determine one of c and  X  , assuming the other is fi xed.

This ( c ,  X  )-diversity also requires F ( k ) b  X  ( k ), where 1  X  k  X  u ,  X  ( k )=1  X   X  ( k ) for u +1  X  k  X  m , and the ( c , (Only if). We prove it by contradiction.

Case 1. Assume that a ( c ,  X  )-diversity with m +1  X  m u  X  1  X  X   X  m  X   X  +1  X  X  ( c cannot be less than 1).

Sequential sweep algorithm labeled by a unique QI value. If an EC does not satisfy the given ( heuristic order of QI values and then discuss main steps of the algorithm in some details. 4.1. A heuristic order of QI values
Without loss of generality, we assume that the QI consist of attributes A the lattice de fi ned by taxonomies of these attributes. For each QI value q , q [ A in the taxonomy of A i at some level (assuming the root is at level 0). We use L given a value, we can easily fi nd its S i , j and L i , j de fi ne the amount of information retained by a QI value as follows.
First, consider any value in a single attribute, say A i , at level L as level of a taxonomy tree may cover different number of leaves, I ( S value in S i , j . Next, consider a QI value q such that q [ A information retained by q is given by Notice that different QI values may retain the same amount of information.

Since v q q [ A i ] are ancestors of q [ A i ]. Since the taxonomy is a tree, q [ A [ A ]= q 2 [ A i ]. But, this implies q 1 = q 2 , a contradiction.
