The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) was released to the public in 2008. It remains the largest manually annotated corpus of discourse relations to date. Its focus on discourse relations that adjacency has not only facilitated its use in language technology and psycholinguistics but also has spawned the annotation of comparable corpora in other languages and genres. inadvertent) assumptions about the PDTB and its annotation that may have weakened previous allow developers of future comparable resources to recognize whether the variations are relevant to them; and (4) to enumerate and explain relationships between PDTB annotation and comple-mentary annotation of other linguistic phenomena. The paper draws on work done by ourselves and others since the corpus was released. 1. Introduction
The Penn Discourse TreeBank, or PDTB (Prasad et al. 2008; PDTB-Group 2008) is the largest manually annotated resource of discourse relations. This annotation has been added to the million-word Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (PTB) corpus (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993), indicating relations between the events, facts, states, and propositions conveyed in the text X  X elations that are essential to its understanding. Some relations are signalled explicitly, as in Example (1), where the underlined phrase as a result signals a causal relation between the situation described in the first two sentences (called Arg1 in the PDTB, formatted here in italics ) and a situation described in the third sentence (called Arg2 , formatted here in bold ). Other relations lack an explicit signal, as in Example (2), where there is no explicit signal of the causal relation between the situation described in the first sentence and that described in the second. Nevertheless, there is no change in meaning if the relation is made explicit X  X or example, using the same phrase as a result (Martin 1992). (1) Jewelry displays in department stores were often cluttered and uninspired. (2) In July, the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually annotated in the PDTB 2.0 (cf. Section 3.2, Table 1), which was released in February 2008, through the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). 1 Researchers since then, in both lan-guage technology and psycholinguistics, have begun to use the PDTB in their research, developing methods and tools for automatically annotating discourse relations (Wellner and Pustejovsky 2007; Elwell and Baldridge 2008; Pitler et al. 2008; Pitler and Nenkova 2009; Wellner 2009; Prasad et al. 2010a, 2011; Zhou et al. 2010; Ghosh et al. 2011a, 2011b, 2012; Lin, Ng, and Kan 2012; Ramesh et al. 2012), generating questions (Prasad and
Joshi 2008; Agarwal, Shah, and Mannem 2011), ensuring an appropriate realization of discourse relations in the output of statistical machine translation (Meyer 2011; Meyer and Popescu-Belis 2012; Meyer and Webber 2013), and testing hypotheses about human discourse processing (Asr and Demberg 2012a, 2012b, 2013; Jiang 2013; Patterson and
Kehler 2013). Other researchers have adapted the PDTB style of annotation to create comparable resources in other languages and genres (Section 4).
 of the PDTB, Section 2 of the paper lays out the key ideas behind the PDTB annotation methodology, and Section 3 describes the corpus in more detail than previous papers (Prasad et al. 2008; PDTB-Group 2008) and presents what we have learned since release of the corpus in 2008. Secondly, for those researchers who have used the PDTB, Section 3 aims to point out significant features of its annotation that have either been ignored or taken to be intrinsic when they are simply accidental . We hope that this will enable researchers to derive more from the corpus in the future and recognize the value of having it more completely annotated. Thirdly, annotation of comparable resources in other languages and genres has turned out to vary from PDTB annotation in ways that may be of interest to people contemplating the development of comparable resources in other languages and genres. Section 4 summarizes and explains the sources of this variation. Fourthly, Section 5 aims to show how PDTB annotation complements Time-
Bank (Pustejovsky et al. 2003a) and PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005) 922 annotation over the same Penn TreeBank corpus. Section 6 closes with a summary of the key points.
 with discussions of various aspects of PDTB annotation, there has not as yet been as comprehensive and quantified a discussion of issues as presented here, especially con-cerning comparable corpora and complementary annotation. Providing this discussion is a major goal of this paper. We ourselves will be addressing many of these issues in the next few years. 2. Key Ideas Underlying PDTB Annotation
Two key ideas underlie the methodology used in annotating the PDTB, setting it apart from other efforts to annotate discourse relations (e.g., Carlson, Marcu, and Okurowski 2001; Polanyi et al. 2004; Baldridge, Asher, and Hunter 2007). First, it makes no com-mitment to any kind of higher-level discourse structure over the discourse relations annotated between individual text spans. Thus, while theory-neutral itself with respect to higher-level discourse structure, the PDTB invites experimentation with approaches to high-level topic and functional structuring (Stede 2012; Webber, Egg, and Kordoni 2012) or to hierarchical structuring (Mann and Thompson 1988; Asher and Lascarides 2003), as a resource for research aimed at a  X  X ata-driven and emergent theory of discourse structure X  (Bunt, Prasad, &amp; Joshi 2012, page 61).
 (Stede 2008), annotators were asked to look at lexical items that can signal discourse relations, such as the expression As a result in Example (1). When they did signal discourse relations, their arguments and senses were then annotated. Annotators were also asked to look at adjacent sentences that lacked one of these explicit signals. Where serve as its explicit signal (such as As a result in Example (2)), before going on to classify its sense. In both cases, this lexical grounding was aimed at making the annotation more reliable, but it can also serve as a feature in the automated identification of discourse relations mentioned in Section 1.
 paper (Prasad et al. 2008) and the PDTB-2.0 annotation manual (PDTB-Group 2008).
Other papers describe specific aspects of the annotation such as the senses used in annotating relations (Miltsakaki et al. 2008), alternative lexicalizations (Prasad, Joshi, and Webber 2010b), and attribution (Prasad et al. 2007). 3. Key Features of PDTB Annotation
Here we discuss four key aspects of PDTB annotation that have been partially ignored or misunderstood: Explicitly signalled discourse relations; implicit discourse relations; properties of the arguments to discourse relations; and several issues concerning the senses of discourse relations and their annotation. These discussions extend the descrip-tion of these features in the original PDTB overview paper and annotation manual. 3.1 Explicitly Signaled Discourse Relations
As Patterson and Kehler (2013) note, the inference of discourse relations may draw heavily upon world knowledge, but may also be facilitated by specific linguistic signals.
It is these signals that we discuss here, distinguishing between (1) the linguistic expres-sions that can explicitly signal a discourse relation; (2) the resource-limited subset of these expressions that were annotated as such in the PDTB; and (3) the consequences of this resource limit on annotation for using the PDTB.
 (possibly discontinuous) spans of text that can be interpreted as propositions, eventual-ities, beliefs, etc. (what Asher [1993] has called abstract objects ). As such, the spans are primarily one or more sentences or clauses, and the expressions that can signal relations between them come from four well-defined syntactic classes: These we have called discourse connectives , or explicit connectives .
 relations, linguistic expressions suggested by previous researchers (Halliday and Hasan 1976; Martin 1992; Knott 1996; Forbes-Riley, Webber, and Joshi 2006). This set was then enlarged as new connectives were found in the WSJ corpus itself. Also identified during this phase were productive modifiers of explicit connectives such as apparently , at least modifiers. 2 ing sentence-initial Now (Example (3)), Well (Example (4)), So (Example (5)), and OK (Example (6)), because they signal topic changes such as the beginning of a subtopic or a return to a previous topic (Hirschberg and Litman 1993), rather than relating particular discourse elements. (3) Now why, you have to ask yourself, would intelligent beings haul a bunch (4) Well , mankind can rest easier for now. [wsj 1272] (5) So , OK kids, everybody on stage for  X  X arry On Trading. X  [wsj 2402] (6) When Mr. Jacobson walked into the office at 7:30 a.m. EDT, he announced: matrix utterance X  X pecifically, that it is  X  X ither aligned with or contrary to something previously said by another speaker, by the speaker on a previous occasion or to what people in general say X  (Aijmer and Simon-Vandenbergen 2004). But in fact was anno-tated in the PDTB as a discourse connective, whereas actually was not. Nevertheless, 924 this accidental annotation provides interesting information on what discourse relations pragmatic markers are associated with, which seems worth further study.
 lations were actually annotated as such. In particular, sentence-initial prepositional phrases with an overt deictic argument (e.g., for that reason , by then ) were not included in the set of explicit discourse connectives and hence not systematically annotated because it was felt this could be put off until deictic coreference was annotated more generally.
The consequences of limiting a priori what were taken as possible signals for a discourse relation 3 meant that adjacent sentences lacking one of these expressions might contain a different sort of evidence for a discourse relation between them. The consequence for annotating implicit discourse relations is described in the next section. 3.2 Implicit Relations
The PDTB calls discourse relations that lack an explicit discourse connective between their arguments implicit discourse relations . Users of the PDTB thus need to under-stand (1) where and how implicit relations were annotated and (2) what was done in their absence.
 plicit discourse relations. Rather, annotators were asked to consider implicit discourse relations only between adjacent sentences within a paragraph, in the absence of an explicit connective relating them. The procedure involved (1) identifying one or more connectives that could be inserted between the two sentences without changing the discourse relation(s) between them, and then (2) specifying the sense of those relations.
This had several consequences, each of which is discussed further in this section: PDTB Relations No. of tokens Explicit 18,459 Implicit 16,224 AltLex 624 EntRel 5,210 NoRel 254 Total 40,600 most of the PDTB annotation conventions but allows an implicit discourse relation to hold between non-adjacent sentences within the same paragraph (cf. Section 4.5). This has reduced the proportion of potential implicit relations that were marked NoRel from 1.15% in the PDTB (254/22141, cf. Table 1) to 0.9% (29/3223) in the BioDRB (Prasad et al. 2011). The same choice was made in the Hindi DRB (Kolachina et al. 2012).
 future. Example (7) illustrates point (3): One could insert a connective such as afterwards relation of temporal PRECEDENCE between the event expressed in the main clause

In Section 5.2, we discuss how PropBank ArgM annotation can be used in addressing gaps in the annotation of sentence-internal implicit relations in the PDTB. taken to arise from the relation being signalled by an expression from outside the set of explicit connectives. These expressions were annotated as Alternative Lexicalizations of evidence for discourse relations and their Arg1 and Arg2 annotated accordingly. We have counted them under AltLex relations in Table 1 rather than as Implicit discourse relations (also shown there). For example, in Example (8), inserting a connective like be-cause between the sentences was felt to be redundant. Here, One reason is was annotated as an alternative lexicalization of the causal relation between them (indicated in
CAPITALS adjacent to Arg2 ). (8) Now, GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in discourse connectives due to resource limitations (cf. Section 3.1). Other expressions 926 izations) meet all the criteria for explicit connectives, even though they had not been included earlier. Another 9% of expressions were found to be phrases such as What X  X  more (Example (9)), which suggests that the range of discourse connectives should be widened to include other syntactic classes. notated when annotators found it redundant to insert an implicit connective between adjacent sentences. For example, whereas 15 tokens of that means were noticed and annotated as AltLex , another 18 in the corpus were not examined, such as the one following and in Example (10). (10)  X  I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy , and that means my

 commented on the lack of a complete list of words and phrases serving this role (Versley 2010; Rysov  X  a 2012; Meyer and Webber 2013). Rather than provide annotators with an incomplete list of connectives and allowing them to identify alternative lexicalizations during annotation), one might consider giving them complete freedom as to what to annotate as grounding for discourse relations. Although such a process has its own problems (Section 4.1), expert annotators and good training may make it a plausible basis for effective discourse annotation.
 because they were not able to infer a discourse relation between them, they were asked to check whether the second sentence provided more information about one or more entities mentioned in the previous sentence, as in (11) Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, will join the board as a nonexecutive director
If it did, annotators were told to annotate the relation type as EntRel . EntRel captures entity-based coherence between sentences (Knott et al. 2001) realized either directly (i.e., via an anaphoric pronoun or NP in the second sentence) or indirectly (i.e., through a bridging inference ). Annotators were not asked to annotate their evidence for EntRel. Although it might be possible to use a resource such as the coreference annotation in
OntoNotes (Weischedel et al. 2012) to recover what the annotators had in mind, in cases such as Example (12) the entity-based coherence is less obvious. (12) This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout
Such cases would benefit from the entity or entities that ground this relation being an-notated explicitly, as well as provide valuable data for studies of entity-based coherence. native Lexicalization or an Entity-relation between adjacent sentences (within the same paragraph). These they annotated as NoRel.
 occurring concurrently with an implicit connective. That is, a recent unpublished pilot study carried out at the University of Edinburgh (Jiang 2013) used MTurk to show that readers presented with text containing a discourse adverbial also infer the sense asso-ciated with a conjunction (coordinating or subordinating), even when no conjunction is present in the text. The study involved 80 items taken from the freely available Corpus of American English , each consisting of a clause, followed by a gap, followed by a clause
HIT (Human Intelligence Task) consisted of one item and six conjunctions ( and , because , before , but , or , so , or none). The Turker was asked to insert into the gap, the conjunction (or none) that seemed most natural between the clauses.

In Example (14), 49/52 Turkers inserted so into the gap, showing that they interpreted the relation as being the same as if what was explicit was so instead : (14) He suspected he shouldn X  X  say that. Instead he lied.
 Notice how different Example (13) would be if it were realized with so instead , or Example (14) with but instead : Neither is what the writer intended.
 showing that they interpreted the relation as being the same as because instead , whereas the other Turkers chose differently among the other options: (15) If he X  X  expected her to be upset, he was disappointed. Instead , she laughed,
Although it is not yet clear which discourse adverbials are compatible with one or more concurrent implicit relations, it is nevertheless likely that such discourse relations are under-annotated in the PDTB and should be addressed. 3.3 Arguments
The two arguments to discourse relations contribute to the senses of the relations taken to hold between them. The PDTB gives annotators two ways to restrict these arguments to only the material needed for these relations.
 participate in discourse relations. In English, such abstract entities tend to be conveyed through sentences, clauses, nominalizations, and verb phrases. Hence, these are what can be annotated in the PDTB as arguments. 4 Also because discourse deictics (e.g., this , 928 that , so ) can refer back to such interpretations (Example (16)), as can particles such as yes and no that function as responses to questions (Example (17)), these can also be annotated as arguments. (16) Evaluations suggest that good ones are X  especially so if the effects on (17) Underclass youth are a special concern. [ Sup 1 Are such expenditures relation (a minimality principle ), was to allow annotators to specify that other text ap-peared relevant but not necessary to that interpretation. Specifically, they could annotate as Sup1 , material supplementary to Arg1, as in Example (17), where the preceding ques-tion was annotated as relevant to interpreting the question response particle, and as
Sup2 , material supplementary to Arg2, as in Example (18), where the material enclosed in square brackets was annotated as relevant but not necessary to interpreting the temporal relation expressed with then . (18) It acquired Thomas Edison X  X  microphone patent and then immediately sued annotated in the PDTB, mainly because annotaters were only invited, and not required, to check whether any text should be so annotated. This shows when one compares the number of Sup1 or Sup2 annotations on explicit discourse relations, which were annotated first, with the number of such annotations on implicit discourse relations, which were annotated on a subsequent pass: 1,571 explicit relations were annotated with supplementary information, whereas only 126 implicit relations were, despite nearly equal numbers of both. Before considering the existence of Sup1 or Sup2 as a feature indicative of the likely use of an explicit connective to signal a discourse relation (Patterson and Kehler 2013), it must be assessed whether this is an accidental feature of the PDTB X  X  annotation or an intrinsic feature of the discourse relations themselves. a given discourse relation involves the separate annotation of attribution (Prasad et al. 2007). This allows the attribution holding between an agent and an abstract object to be included or excluded from the discourse relation as appropriate. For example, in
Example (19), annotators could exclude the attribution phrase  X  X aid Howard Rubel, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York X  from Arg1, as unnec-essary for the discourse relation, while including the attribution phrase  X  X r. Asman is also annoyed X  as necessary for the discourse relation in Example (20). (19) Defense contractors  X  X annot continue to get contracts on that basis, X  said (20) Mr. Asman is also annoyed that Mr. Castro has resisted collaboration with U.S. can be seen by contrasting Example (21), where (negative) denying is part of Arg2 , and
Example (22), where (negative) denying is not part of Arg1 , but is rather its attribution. (21) The U.S. wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment ; (22) Viacom denies it X  X  using pressure tactics . ( E XPANSION
In Example (21), the wanting in Arg1 is taken to contrast with the denying in Arg2 . But in Example (22), the negative polarity of denying as the attribution of Arg1 means that being willing to negotiate is taken to further specify not using pressure tactics . the existence of a particular discourse relation. There is no comparable attempt to ensure that spans annotated as arguments to discourse relations include all the features that motivate a given relation (Section 3.4). This can be seen with discourse relations associated with the connective instead . Its Arg1 must convey an alternative that does not hold (Webber 2013): In Example (23), Arg1 conveys that  X  X  price for the new shares has been set X  is an alternative that does not hold. (23) No price for the new shares has been set . Instead , the companies will leave may not be present in the argument itself. For example, the PDTB annotators agreed that the clause  X  X o be any silver lining X  was Arg1 of instead in Example (24), based on the minimality principle mentioned at the start of this section. But there is nothing in this argument that conveys that this alternative does not hold. That would require Arg1 to be  X  X here isn X  X  likely to be any silver lining. X  However, the annotators did not take such an argument to be minimal. (24) In China, however, there isn X  X  likely to be any silver lining because the
Although in the majority of cases, minimal argument spans do contain all the features needed to license the annotated sense, this was not required by the PDTB guidelines.
This point has been missed in efforts to use the PDTB in training automated sense recognition. 3.4 Senses and their Annotation
A well-known feature of the PDTB is its three-level hierarchy of senses (Figure 1). The express purpose of this hierarchy was to allow back-off to a more general sense if (1) an 930 individual annotator could not decide among its more specific senses or if (2) pairs of annotators disagreed as to a more specific sense.
 explicit and/or implicit discourse relations have used the four top-level (level-1) sense classes for their research (e.g., Pitler et al. 2008; Pitler and Nenkova 2009; Zhou et al. specificity (Table 2).
 discuss three issues in sense labeling, which should help readers to better understand both the PDTB and the comparable corpora described in Section 4. The issues are: (1) senses found to be missing from the sense inventory; (2) disagreements between annotators; and (3) annotation of multiple concurrent discourse relations. 3.4.1 Missing Senses. We have long realized that there are gaps in the set of available senses. Some of these gaps are noted in the PDTB Annotation Manual (PDTB-Group 2008), such as the absense of a S IMILARITY sense for labeling explicit relations headed by as if and the absense of a P URPOSE sense for labeling explicit relations headed by so that . Cases of the latter, as well as relations conveying the sense that one argument was the G OAL of the other, were simply annotated with the overloaded label C
TINGENCY .C AUSE .R ESULT . The 34 cases of the subordinating conjunction just as , which can also signal S IMILARITY , were found on subsequent analysis of the corpus to be annotated as either T EMPORAL .S YNCHRONY (13 tokens) or E (1 token), or to have been left unannotated (20 tokens).
 used in annotating corpora comparable to the PDTB (Section 4.2). They should also be added to the PDTB, and senses known to be overloaded should be split appropriately.
Although this will eliminate already noted sense gaps, the potential remains for addi-tional senses to be identified, and hence this remains a problem. 3.4.2 Disagreements Between Annotators. Sense annotation was done by two annotators.
Disagreement at level-1 occurred when the two annotators picked senses that belonged at or under different level-1 classes. Disagreement at level-2 occurred when the an-notators picked senses within the same level-1 class but different level-2 classes (e.g., C
ONTRAST versus C ONCESSION ). Similarly, disagreement at level-3 occurred when the annotators picked different senses under the same level-2 sense class (e.g., and disagreements at level-2 or level-3 were handled through automatic back-off to the next higher level. For example, a JUXTAPOSITION versus would lead to a relation being automatically assigned their level-2 parent, namely, C a level-1 sense annotation for 444 explicit and 257 implicit relations in the PDTB, almost all of which are either C OMPARISON or E XPANSION . Although neither label is very informative, one might interpret such a label simply as under-specified with respect to its more specific level-2 daughters. 3.4.3 Multiple Concurrent Discourse Relations. Researchers using the PDTB for automated sense labeling of discourse relations have, by and large, assumed that its four level-1 joint because they are defined as each other X  X  inverse and hence can X  X  both hold X  C
ONTRA -EXPECTATION . Other senses may be disjoint because their defining inferences contradict one another: for example, R EASON requires Arg2 to precede or coincide with Arg1 , whereas P RECEDENCE requires that Arg1 precede Arg2 . They cannot both hold.
However, most senses are compatible. 932 bels to each explicit or implicit connective, representing concurrent discourse relations.
With explicit connectives, 999 of the 18,459 tokens (5.4%) were assigned two concurrent sense labels, with the most common pairs shown in Table 3.
 tions between two arguments when they are linked by an explicit discourse connective?
Evidence for a higher figure comes from an early experiment with two connectives, since and when (Miltsakaki et al. 2005). There, two annotators were given the option of labeling relations linked by one of these connectives in the WSJ corpus as either
PORAL or CAUSAL or TEMPORAL / CAUSAL , to indicate that both senses were conveyed. (The experiment was done on the 184 relations in the corpus headed by since and the first 100 relations headed by when , out of a total of 989. annotated TEMPORAL / CAUSAL 21 times by one of the annotators (11.3%) and 16 times by the other (8.6%). Those headed by when were annotated TEMPORAL more frequently: 22% by one annotator and 28% by the other.
 10/184 tokens of since (5.4%) were annotated with both a TEMPORAL sense, and only 184/989 tokens of when (18.6%) were annotated with both some kind of TEMPORAL and some kind of CAUSAL sense. In both cases, this is significantly less frequent than in the earlier experiment, suggesting that if annotators are not given explicit joint-sense options (such as TEMPORAL / CAUSAL only invited to use multiple concurrent sense labels if they take multiple discourse loss to both language technology and theoretical and psycholinguistic understanding of discourse relations, and a situation that deserves to be fixed. sense label to a single implicit connective or they could insert more than one implicit connective, which were then individually sense-labeled. Both options indicated that concurrent discourse relations could be taken to hold between the specified arguments.
Of the 16,224 implicit relations, 359 (2.2%) were annotated with a single implicit connec-tive with multiple senses, and 171 (1.1%) were annotated with two implicit connectives, each taken to have a single sense. Both of these are very small numbers, so no hard conclusions can be drawn. Nevertheless, one might sample whether more of the implicit relations annotated with some CAUSAL sense might be more accurately annotated with some TEMPORAL sense as well.
 with each assigned a single sense, over half (93/171 = 54.4%) involved a connective because, for one thing ); 13 more (7.5%) were paired with in particular or specifically (e.g., in although, in fact ; so, in fact ). All but in fact are really connective modifiers (Section 3.1), even though they can also appear separately as connectives in their right. Such cases deserve further analysis, in connection with getting a better understanding of modified connectives, their prevalence, and their semantics. 4. Annotated Corpora Comparable to the PDTB
We noted in Section 1 that release of the PDTB has spawned similar efforts to annotate resources in other languages and genres following a lexically grounded approach to discourse relations. We also noted that these efforts vary in interesting ways from that of the PDTB. Here we describe both the nature and the sources of this variation, so that people contemplating development of comparable resources in additional languages and/or genres will recognize variation that is appropriate to their situation, while avoiding unnecessary variation that prevents inter-operability of these comparable corpora (Bunt, Prasad, and Joshi 2012).
 annotation: the BioDRB (Prasad et al. 2011), the Leeds Arabic Discourse TreeBank, or
LADTB (Al-Saif and Markert 2010, 2011; Al-Saif 2012), the Chinese Discourse TreeBank (Xue 2005; Zhou and Xue 2012; Zhou and Xue (in press)), the Turkish Discourse Bank or TDB (Zeyrek et al. 2008, 2009; Aktas  X , Bozs  X ahin, and Zeyrek 2010; Zeyrek et al. 2010;
Demirsahin et al. 2013; Zeyrek et al. 2013), the Hindi Discourse Relation Bank (Oza et al. 2009; Kolachina et al. 2012; Sharma et al. 2013), and the Prague Discourse TreeBank, or information needed to compare it to the other corpora in Table 4 is not available.) they all adhere to the key ideas of PDTB annotation (Section 2) in being neutral to any discourse structure beyond the argument structure of individual discourse relations and in grounding discourse relations in lexical expressions. Where they annotate implicit discourse relations (Table 4), these comparable corpora follow the PDTB in annotating an inferred lexical grounding.
 tween two and only two abstract objects, called Arg1 and Arg2, each associated with 934 a possibly discontinuous text span. Although not every corpus annotates atttribution, where it is annotated, it is separate from the annotation of discourse relations. 4.1 Annotation Workflow
Because one purpose of this section is to inform people considering the development of similar resources in other languages and genres, we will briefly mention how workflow has varied in the development of comparable corpora and how it has affected annotator effort and inter-annotator agreement.
 explicit and implicit relations, as explicits were perceived as easier to annotate. Explicit discourse relations were annotated one connective at a time throughout the corpus, before moving on to the next one on the list. The rationale for this was to improve the annotators X  ability to annotate a particular connective by focusing their attention on that connective. Subsequently, implicit discourse relations were annotated document by document, analyzing each pair of adjacent sentences within each paragraph, as described in Section 3.2. Later, senses were annotated for explicit and implicit discourse relations X  X xplicits by connective, and implicits by document.
 annotating the LADTB (Al-Saif 2012; Al-Saif and Markert 2011), the nature of Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA) demanded a different workflow. In MSA, as in English, words that can function as discourse connectives also have non-discourse functions. As such, identifying its arguments. One common form of argument to discourse relations in
Arabic news texts is an Al-maSdar noun, which is a tense-less expression of an event. Their frequency affected annotation workflow in the LADTB.
 volved highlighting for the annotators all potential discourse connectives (including word-initial clitics), based on a pre-compiled list. An annotator first read through the entire text to achieve an overall understanding, before stepping through the highlighted the annotator would see whether it had arguments, including strings interpretable as al-maSdar nouns. Workflow thus involved simultaneous confirmation of potential discourse connectives and identification of their arguments. After that, the annotator would add the one or more senses that a relation expresses. If a potential connective did not express a discourse function, the annotator would note it and go on to the next highlighted item.
 perceived in annotating inter-sentential relations in scientific text. On encountering a prior discourse, and only then annotate any intra-sentential relations within it. In this way, annotators were made to first attend to relations that were harder to pin down, as they progressed in their sequential reading and annotation of the text.
 lows a fully sequential annotation strategy, largely for a language-specific reason X  X he customary writing style of Chinese, which often does not bother to distinguish the end of a sentence (marked with a full stop ) from the end of a clause (marked with a comma ). This has two major consequences: No rigid distinction can be made between inter-and intra-sentential connectives, and annotators must consider implicit relations both between full-stop delimited sentences and comma-delimited clauses. (The latter have not been annotated in the current PDTB.) Annotating implicit relations between comma-delimited clauses results in many more implicit relations. Zhou and Xue (2012) compared with a 46 X 54% split in the PDTB. As such, having a separate task to cover 18% of the data was disfavored.
 annotation, it can affect inter-annotator agreement. To this end, researchers developing the Hindi DRB (Oza et al. 2009; Kolachina et al. 2012) carried out a systematic study of three workflow strategies (Sharma et al. 2013). The first strategy modeled the task exactly as in PDTB. In the second, explicits and implicits were annotated in exactly the order in which they were encountered on a sequential reading of the text. The third strategy operated per text, with annotators first marking all of its explicit connectives, and then its implicit relations, before moving on to another text. The latter two strategies were designed to ensure that annotators were aware of the coherence and flow of the discourse when carrying out the task. Sharma X  X  findings show that better agreement is obtained when the annotators X  attention is held to the text, but with no clear preference for a fully sequential approach (as in the second strategy), or an approach that separated the tasks on a text-by-text basis (as in the third).
 as noted for Chinese, the final choice, then, should be driven by considerations of 936 annotation reliability, which seems to be enhanced by the annotators attending to the coherence and flow of the discourse . Interoperability among these resources is not an issue here, as long as whatever strategy is used yields highly consistent annotation. 4.2 Inventory and Organization of Senses
The senses of discourse relations used in the PDTB and the hierarchy in which they are organized (Miltsakaki et al. 2008) drew on both in-house experiments (Miltsakaki et al. 2004, 2005) and previous work on the semantics of discourse relations (Lakoff 1971;
Moens and Steedman 1988; Sweetser 1990; Jayez and Rossari 1998; Kehler 2002), among others. Neither has been adopted without some change in the comparable corpora:
Additional senses have been introduced, while other senses have been eliminated or modified; the sense hierarchy has been modified, and in one case, abandoned. For example, Oza et al. (2009) propose a more general and uniform treatment of those dis-course relations that are pragmatic , relating the speech act of one argument to either the content or speech act of the other. Al-Saif and Markert (2011) do the same. Almost every corpus includes at least one additional sense class, including
BACKGROUND , and GRADATION , among others, motivated more by the genre of the texts being annotated than by their language.
 The BioDRB has eliminated the four top-level classes, adopting a two-level hierarchy. The Prague Discourse TreeBank (Pol  X  akov  X  a et al. 2012) now part of the PDT 3.0 and the
LADTB (Al-Saif and Markert 2011) have also adopted a two-level hierarchy, but they preserve the top-level classes, collapsing the second and third levels of annotation. The
Chinese Discourse TreeBank (Zhou and Xue 2012) has eliminated the hierarchy entirely, using a flat classification of just twelve sense categories. Sense annotation has not yet begun on the Turkish Discourse Bank.
 and classification of discourse relation senses is of utmost importance, because conflicts in the assumed meaning of labels would preclude any kind of comparative studies of the annotated resources, both within and across languages and domains. With the growing number of variations in sense annotation schema, we believe it is critical to collect the insights and findings from these studies and to find common threads, since we believe there is much that is common between them. Indeed, some recent work has usefully provided a mapping between their classification schemes and the PDTB classification (Prasad et al. 2011; Zhou and Xue 2012). 4.3 Annotation of Explicit Connectives
An obvious way in which the corpora vary is in the choice of explicit connectives to be annotated. Because of the rich morphology of Turkish, explicit connectives in Turk-ish include morphological suffixes attached to verb roots and complex subordinators consisting of a connective and a nominalizing suffix. The former have not yet been annotated in the Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB), although the latter have been (Zeyrek et al. 2013). Counterparts of the latter, called phrasal expressions in the TDB, appear as
AltLex in the PDTB. As in the LADTB (Al-Saif 2012), nominalizations are commonly annotated as arguments in the TDB.
 separate words and phrases) serving as explicit connectives, Arabic writing tends towards long sentences conjoined with coordinating conjunctions (Ostler 1987), with the equivalent of and commonly found at the beginning of sentences and paragraphs (Al-Saif 2012). It was so common at the beginning of paragraphs in the newswire text annotated in the LADTB that all such tokens were simply assigned a C indicated. 4.4 Lexical Grounding for Implicit Discourse Relations
The approach used in lexically grounding implicit discourse relations seems to be language-specific. For English, the PDTB X  X  lexically grounded approach led to guide-lines for annotating implicit relations in which annotators were asked to identify one or more connectives that could be inserted between proposed arguments to express the discourse relation(s) they took to hold between them (cf. Section 3.2). This was meant to serve as explicit evidence for their decisions.
 effectively using paraphrase rather than insertion. This is because, in a majority of cases,
This suggests that Chinese may use particular syntactic constructions to indicate intra-sentential discourse relations even more than English and German do (Meyer and
Webber 2013). Thus, instead of having their annotators insert explicit connectives, Zhou and Xue (2012) have them paraphrase the relation between proposed arguments in terms of explicit connectives that typically express each discourse relation. These prototypical connectives then serve as the lexical grounding for the relation.
 to lexically grounding implicit relations, it is something that corpus developers should keep in mind, especially when considering the annotation of discourse relations within sentences. 4.5 Locus of Implicit Relations The corpora differ in where they look for implicit discourse relations. As noted in
Section 3.2, implicit relations were only considered in the PDTB between adjacent sentences within the same paragraph. Although a sentence might have an implicit relation to a sentence further afield, we decided that it would add too much to an already costly effort to have annotators seek them out. With respect to implicit discourse relations within a single sentence, we are aware of having deliberately ignored (for lack of resources) discourse relations that we know are there.
 already noted (Section 4.1) that the structure of Chinese sentences is such that a much larger proportion of discourse relations in Chinese occur intra-sententially. Hence the greater need to look for them there.
 but not for language-specific reasons. Rather, it follows from the cost X  X overage decision that all annotation efforts face. In this case, in both the Hindi Discourse Resource and the 938
BioDRB, implicit discourse relations have been sought more widely, allowing a sentence to be related to a non-adjacent sentence within the same paragraph. 4.6 Naming Convention for Arg1 and Arg2
One final way in which corpora comparable to the PDTB vary is with respect to the naming convention for Arg1 and Arg2 . In the PDTB, the choice follows syntactic criteria:
With explicit discourse connectives, Arg2 is the argument syntactically bound to the connective, and Arg1 is the other argument. With implicit connectives, Arg1 is the left-adjacent sentence, and Arg2 , the right-adjacent one.
 Bank, the Chinese Discourse TreeBank, the Prague Discourse TreeBank, and the Hindi
Discourse Resource have followed a semantically driven convention, in which argu-ments that play the same semantic role have the same label. This then eliminates level-3 senses in the PDTB sense hierarchy (e.g., reason/result, expectation/contra-expectation, precedence/succession) whose only purpose is to reflect the different linear order of the arguments. Again, while these differences are admissible without impacting the annotation scheme in any major way, comparative studies using these corpora need to be sensitive to these differences. We note, however, that in an experiment using this strategy for the Hindi annotation, Kolachina et al. (2012) report poor agreement for arguments of relations, and speculate that it was harder for annotators to use the semantic labeling convention. 4.7 Summary
Discourse annotation efforts that have followed the PDTB in adopting a lexically grounded (or adjacency-based) approach to annotation nevertheless differ from the
PDTB in ways discussed earlier. Still, it appears that none of these differences is so great lingual language technology or machine translation (Meyer 2011; Meyer and Popescu-
Belis 2012; Meyer and Webber 2013). 5. Complementary Annotations
Some of the linguistic phenomena annotated in the PDTB have also been annotated in connection with other levels of linguistic annotation X  X n particular, the temporal annotation of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank corpus found in TimeBank 1.2 (Pustejovsky et al. 2003a) and the verb-argument annotation found in
PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005). Here we describe how these annota-tions are related.
 described here. From a practical perspective, it might allow for future merging of annotation layers (Pustejovsky et al. 2005), future seeding of one annotation layer with another, and/or future consistency checking based on constraints between annotation at different levels. From a deeper, theoretical perspective, the work has the potential to lower, or even remove, barriers that have long existed between linguistic research at the sentence level and at the discourse level X  X arriers that have been equally obstructive towards  X  X he transition from sentence to discourse. X  5.1 TimeML and TimeBank The TimeML temporal/event annotation (Pustejovsky et al. 2003b) of texts from the Penn TreeBank forms part of the TimeBank 1.2 corpus (Pustejovsky et al. 2003a). expressed either explicitly or implicitly in a text. The information that TimeML makes explicit includes temporal expressions such as the date 10/26/1989 (tagged as temporal events such as Nigel Lawson resigning as Chancellor of the Exchequer (tagged as EVENT ), temporal signals such as after , during , and in (tagged as relations between pairs of temporal expressions or event instances, or between a tem-poral expression and an event instance (tagged as TLINK ). The set of temporal relations comes from Allen (1984). When a temporal relation is explicitly indicated by a temporal signal , the signal is included in the TLINK . This enables a clear correspondence with the PDTB.

 ferred from discourse relations that are not primarily temporal. For example, some discourse relations annotated in the PDTB as causal (i.e., C

This is the case in Example (28), where TimeBank annotates the holding event as occurring before the adjusting event, which has a negative polarity attribute.

 would require a more detailed study of both the annotation frameworks and annotation practice in the two corpora. The same would go for using the annotation in one as a consistency check on the other. Nevertheless, both would potentially be of great value to delivering more usefully annotated resources. rent part of an existing office tower . [wsj 0784] 5.2 PropBank More interesting is the relation between PDTB annotation of discourse relations and
PropBank annotation (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005) of the sentence-internal ar-gument structure. PropBank provides, for each verb predicate in the Penn TreeBank, its sense and the semantic role of each of its arguments. An argument can be either required by the verb through its valency and assigned an index such as Arg0, Arg1, and so on, or accepted as a modifier (annotated with an ArgM label). ArgM arguments are further assigned functional tags such as MNR (manner), MOD (modal), TMP (temporal), CAU (causal), DIS (discourse), and so forth. For example, the PropBank annotation of one instance of the verb rent is shown in Figure 2a. Besides its subject and object (Arg0 and
Arg1), the modal auxiliary will is annotated as ArgM-MOD and the subordinate clause headed by until is annotated ArgM-TMP.
 that denote events. Many of these align with discourse relations in the PDTB. For example, the ArgM annotation of the subordinate clause in Figure 2a corresponds to Arg2 of the PDTB annotation of the discourse relation associated with until (Figure 2b). annotation layers, and in doing so consider two related questions: (1) How many and to what extent are the intra-sentential relations in PDTB also accounted for by the dependencies annotated in PropBank, and (2) Are there gaps in the discourse-level annotation that can be identified from the PropBank layer? Our analysis here is in terms of the annotation in PropBank-1. 9 Although the scope of this annotation has been extended within the Ontonotes project (Weischedel et al. 2012), this does not affect our general points. 5.2.1 Correspondence of PDTB Intra-sentential Relations with PropBank. We first assess whether the intra-sentential relations in the PDTB can be fully accounted for by the verb-
ArgM dependencies in PropBank in terms of quantity, content, and consistency. If so, annotating them again at the discourse level would have involved needless repetition. 942 28% of the discourse relations annotated in the corpus. Of these 11,830 relations (all of which are candidates for overlap with PropBank), 11,236 involve explicit connectives and 594 do not. The latter primarily hold between independent clauses separated by a semicolon. As the clauses so-linked are independent, neither being a modifier of the other, these relations are not covered in PropBank.
 by an explicit coordinating conjunction (such as and and but ). Like the semicolon-separated clauses, these are independent and so also outside the scope of PropBank. The set also includes relations between clauses in the same sentence signaled by a discourse adverbial. In PropBank, discourse adverbials are generally annotated as discourse-linking modifiers (ARGM-DIS), leaving unspecified what they link to. For example, in Example (30), the discourse adverbial instead conveys a relation between the two  X  X hrowing X  propositions. While PropBank annotates instead as ARGM-DIS of the main clause throw , it does not explicitly link instead to its other argument. (30) When the champ has lost his stuff, the great mystery novelist wrote, when he attached to these verbs were not covered. However, copula verbs have subsequently been included in extensions covering over 75% of PropBank-1 and released as part of Ontonotes-5.0, so these subordinating clauses are now marked as arguments.
 differ in their semantics. Specifically, even those PropBank ArgM roles that are closest to discourse relations X  X rgM-CAU (causal), ArgM-TMP (temporal), ArgM-PNC (pur-pose), ArgM-MNR (manner), and ArgM-ADV (adverbial) X  X iffer from the semantics of

PropBank annotation of the verb say over the PTB parse tree shown in Figure 3(a), with its initial when -clause parsed as a temporal modifier (ArgM-TMP) of say . In contrast,
PDTB annotation has been done over the raw text, with discontinuous spans permitted as arguments. This allows attribution to be included or excluded from a discourse relation (Section 3.3). In this case, Figure 3(c) shows attribution is excluded: The tem-poral relation ( SUCCESSION ) is annotated between winning and awarding , implying that
Mr. Green X  X  winning of the verdict was followed by the judge giving him the additional award. Given the difference in annotation practice, the extent of such mismatches between PDTB and PropBank is expected to be the same as that between PDTB and PTB (Dinesh et al. 2005).

PDTB (i.e., those with both arguments in the same sentence) can be fully accounted for by the verb-ArgM dependencies in PropBank. We have shown that the account is only partial, due in part to the significantly different goals of the two annotation projects and in part to differences in methodological choices. As such, even intra-sententially, a separate layer of discourse relation annotation is motivated. 944 5.2.2 Potential of Seeding New Discourse Relations from PropBank. Next, we assess whether any of the verb-ArgM dependencies in PropBank could potentially correspond to dis-course relations that are not yet annotated in the PDTB. If the type and number of such relations is significant, then PropBank annotations could be used to seed the PDTB with new relations, which could then be corrected and/or annotated manually.
 started by considering only the five ArgM types mentioned earlier, which gave us a total of 43,432 verb X  X rgM dependencies. For ease of analysis, we ignored the tokens of split ArgMs (i.e., ArgMs that are not spanned by a single node). We also ignored tokens from WSJ texts that were not included in the PDTB distribution because of problems with conversion of the parsed files to stand off annotation format (PDTB-Group 2008).
PropBank alignment with the PTB. 4116 of these are free adjuncts (Example (31)), all of which are new potential discourse relations to consider for the PDTB (cf. Section 3.2).
The remaining 7,422 clauses either start with a subordinator or subordinating con-junction, including both finite (Example (32)) and non-finite (Example (33)) adverbial clauses, or are reduced clauses (Example (34)). For these explicitly subordinated clauses,
PropBank alignment with the PDTB shows that explicit subordinators/subordinating conjunctions were annotated as connectives in 5,471 of the 7,422 ArgMs, leaving the remaining 1,951 ArgMs as new potential discourse relations for the PDTB. Each of adjuncts and the 1,951 subordinated clauses) would still have to be reviewed manually to determine whether it does in fact fulfill a discourse function or not.

It is important to note here that manner and purpose arguments annotated in PropBank will only be considered arguments to discourse relations when they denote events, facts, states, or propositions, since these are what are taken to be arguments to discourse relations in the PDTB. 5.3 Summary Linguistic annotation invariably involves a considerable amount of time and effort.
When linguistic analysis at multiple levels is encoded on the same source corpus as different layers of annotation, there is potential value in assessing how the annotation content of the different layers differ from each other, and in exploring how annotations from one layer can be exploited usefully for annotation in other layers. This section has compared the annotation content of the PDTB with that of TimeBank and PropBank, showing that while some of the linguistic phenomena annotated in PDTB have also been annotated in TimeBank and PropBank, there are significant differences in both the extent and the content of the annotation. This section has also discussed some of the ways in which annotations from one layer can enrich and/or improve the consistency of annotation in other layers. 6. Conclusion
Our goals in this paper have been to
We hope that the number of researchers able to make use of the PDTB will continue to grow, as will the number of similarly annotated corpora. We ourselves hope to be able to enrich the PDTB in the future X  X idening the scope of discourse relations that are annotated, improving the recording of evidence for annotation decisions, and expanding the annotation to include additional textual genres, especially ones that are less formal than news texts, such as public talks and consumer health advice. The results should be of further benefit to a growing community of scholars and developers considering the challenges of extended text.
