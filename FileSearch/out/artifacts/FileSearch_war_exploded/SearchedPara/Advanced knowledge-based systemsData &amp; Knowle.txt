This special issue on  X  X  Advanced Knowledge-based Systems  X  X f Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering presents a rigorous selection of the best papers of the Invited Session  X  X  X dvanced Knowledge-based Systems X  of the LNCS/LNAI 12th International Confer-ence on Knowledge-based and Intelligent Information &amp; Engineering Systems (KES 2008), held in Zagreb, Croatia, during Septem-ber 3 X 5, 2008.

The Invited Session  X  X  X dvanced Knowledge-based Systems X  of LNCS/LNAI KES 2008 has attracted a large number of sub-missions, and, after a rigorous review process, only 15 papers have been selected for final publication, particularly eight as full papers, and seven as short papers. After the conference, six among the eight full papers have been invited for submission to the Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering special issue on  X  X  Advanced Knowledge-based Systems  X . After two rigorous review rounds, only four papers have been accepted for final publication in this special issue.

Modern intelligent information systems require more and more for advanced knowledge representation, management, and discovery tools and techniques to be implemented within their core layers. This poses new challenges on the issue of devising innovative methodologies and paradigms in the context of a broad umbrella encompassing several research as-pects ranging from knowledge representation to knowledge integration, from knowledge management to knowledge pro-cessing, from knowledge discovery to knowledge delivery, and from knowledge security to privacy preserving knowledge. These argumentations put the basis for a novel class of intelligent systems, the so-called Advanced Knowl-edge-based Systems , which should be reasonably intended as intelligent information systems where knowledge representa-tion, management, and discovery are emphasized in order to achieve complex functionalities beyond those of traditional information-oriented methodologies.
 Advanced Knowledge-based Systems arise in many fields: Advanced Database Management Systems, Advanced Data
Warehouse Systems, Complex Data Mining Tools, OLAP Systems, Machine Learning Tools, Data/Information Integration Sys-tems, Enterprise Information Systems, Business Information Systems, Cooperative Information Systems, Collaborative Infor-mation Systems, Complex Intelligent Information Systems, Hybrid Information Systems, Workflow Management Systems,
Process Mining Systems, Ontology Representation and Management Systems, Web Intelligence Systems, Grid and Web Ser-vices Architectures, Data Stream Management Systems, Sensor Network Data Analysis Tools, and so forth.

With the aim of adequately pursuing both theoretical and practical challenges of this so-large class of Advanced Knowl-edge-based Systems, this special issue contains four papers, each one covering emergent research aspects of such systems, ranging from models and methodologies to algorithms and practical experimentations.
 The first paper, titled  X  X  Noun Retrieval Effect on Text Summarization and Delivery of Personalized News Articles to the User X  X 
Desktop  X , by Christos Bouras and Vassilis Tsogkas, focuses the attention on text summarization and categorization , as well as personalization of results , which are among the most demanding information retrieval tasks. Authors motivate their research by recognizing that deploying a generalized, multi-functional mechanism that produces good results for the aforementioned tasks seems to be a panacea for most of the text-based information retrieval needs. Based on this main motivation, authors propose a set of keyword-based extraction techniques and profiling features implemented in the core layer of a news index-ing system, called PeRSSonal , by exploring the effects that part of speech tagging has on the proper text summarization pro-cedure. This allows authors to enhance the personalization algorithm used by PeRSSonal , thus introducing various features derived from the user X  X  profile, such as the list of viewed articles and the time spent on them. Finally, authors provide an experimental evaluation of proposed personalization approaches in the context of an application scenario described by a client-side desktop application interconnected to PeRSSonal .
 The second paper, titled  X  X  Event-based Lossy Compression for Effective and Efficient OLAP over Data Streams  X , by Alfredo Cuzzocrea and Sharma Chakravarthy, proposes an innovative event-based lossy compression model for effective and efficient
OLAP over data streams , called ECM-DS , along its experimental assessment and analysis. The main novelty of the proposed compression approach with respect to traditional data stream compression techniques relies on exploiting the semantics of the reference application scenario in order to drive the compression process by means of the  X  X  X egree of interestingness X  of events occurring in the target stream. This finally improves the quality of retrieved approximate answers to OLAP queries over data streams, and, in turn, the quality of complex knowledge discovery tasks over data streams developed on top of
ECM-DS , and implemented via ad-hoc data stream mining algorithms. Overall, the compression strategy proposed by authors puts the basis for a novel class of intelligent applications over data streams where the knowledge on actual streams is integrated-with and correlated-to the knowledge related to expired events that are considered critical for the target OLAP analysis scenario. Finally, authors provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation over several classes of data stream sets.
Obtained experimental results clearly confirms the benefits deriving from the event-based data stream compression ap-proach proposed in ECM-DS .

The third paper, titled  X  X  Polynomial Time Queries over Inconsistent Databases with Functional Dependencies and Foreign Keys  X , by Cristian Molinaro and Sergio Greco, addresses the problem of efficiently computing consistent answers to queries over relational databases which may be inconsistent with respect to functional dependencies and foreign key constraints. Since consistent query answers over inconsistent databases are obtained from repaired databases, a repair strategy is first pre-sented by authors. More specifically, authors consider particular sets of functional dependencies, called canonical dependen-cies , and a repair strategy whereby only tuple updates and insertions are allowed in order to restore consistency. If foreign key constraints are violated, new tuples (possibly containing null values ) are inserted into the database, whereas if functional dependency violations occur, tuple updates (possibly introducing unknown values , i.e. special symbols which can take values from a limited set of constants of the source database) are performed. Based on this repair strategy, authors propose a semantics of constraint satisfaction for incomplete databases containing null and unknown values, since the repair process can lead to such databases. The proposed approach allows authors to obtain a unique (incomplete) repaired database which may be computed in polynomial time. Drawing on the results on the complexity of querying incomplete databases contain-ing
OR -objects, authors finally identify classes of constraints for which the consistent answers to particular classes of con-junctive queries can be computed in polynomial time.
 The fourth paper, titled  X  X  Privacy Risks in Trajectory Data Publishing: Reconstructing Private Trajectories from Continuous
Properties  X , by Emre Kaplan, Thomas B. Pedersen, Erkay Sava and Y X cel Sayg X n, considers spatio-temporal data mining tech-niques over trajectories modeled in terms of spatio-temporal traces generated by moving objects. As stated by authors, tra-jectories can indeed contain valuable information to be harvested by spatio-temporal data mining techniques. Applications like city traffic planning, identification of evacuation routes, trend detection, and many more can benefit from trajectory min-ing . However, trajectories of individuals often contain private and sensitive information , so anyone who possess trajectory data must take special care when disclosing this data. As authors recognize, removing identifiers from trajectories before the release is not effective against linkage type attacks, and rich sources of background information make it even worse.
Hence, authors propose to apply transformation techniques to map the given set of trajectories into another set where dis-tances are preserved. This way, actual trajectories are not released, but the distance information can still be successfully exploited by data mining techniques such as clustering. Starting from this main approach, authors show that an unknown private trajectory can be re-constructed using the available background information together with the mutual distances re-leased for data mining purposes, plus background knowledge in the form of known trajectories and extra information such as the speed limit. Authors complete their analytical contribution via demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed tra-jectory re-construction approach by means of an experimental evaluation performed on real trajectory data sets.
