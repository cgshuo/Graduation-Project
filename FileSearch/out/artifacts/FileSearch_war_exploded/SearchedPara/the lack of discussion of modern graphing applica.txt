 the lack of discussion of modern graphing applications (many of which are quite good) called into question everything the authors were trying to communicate.

These shortcomings aside, this book is now mandatory reading for my research students. I expect to refer to it frequently myself.

Memory Practices in the Sciences, Geoffrey C. Bowker. The MIT Press (2005). xi, 261 pp., $34.95, ISBN: 0-262-02589-2
How can a stone be regarded as an archive? In her manifesto of 1951, now finally available in English, Briet (1951, 7; 2006, 10) explained that if a stone is examined as evidence, it is as much a  X  X  X ocument X  X  as a text would be. Hj X rland (1997, p. 111) added that a stone, like any other document, would mean different things to different people, according to their interests and perspectives. Now Geoffrey Bowker puts it nicely: Stones lead a double life. On the one hand they just do what rocks do, ordinarily just sitting on or in the ground, but, when examined, they reveal the history of the earth:  X  X  X s objects they function in the world, and as archives they maintain traces of their own past. Thus a rock can be read as an object that constitutes part of the lithosphere, and equally as a document that contains its own history written into it: striations on the surface indicate past glaciations, strata indicate complex stories of deposition over time ...  X  X  (p. 36).
Memory Practices in the Sciences continues and extends the author X  X  examination of the cultural and the technical in the infrastructure and practice of science. The author says (p. 6) that the book is concerned with how scientists figure their own human and disciplinary past and also the past of whatever they are investigat-ing, but the content of the book is not easily summarized. It examines endless interplays between complex issues: time, memory, documentation, infrastructure, culture, and human agendas.

Time is complex, calibrated by events, calibrating events, and can be excluded from theories and closed systems.

Memory emerges differently in each occasion of recollecting. Bowker is concerned with memory, but he deals with recording and representation more than remembering and he is interested in the many ways in which, over time, descriptive documentation fails to support accurate or useful reconstruction of the past.
The word  X  X  X rchive X  X  is very widely used to include all surviving traces of, or concerning, the past. All archives are highly selective. Leaving traces is a situated rhetorical activity, more or less unsatisfactory for audiences in other, later situations. Interpretation requires contextualizing knowledge that is often not avail-able. Yet it is the imperfect archive of traces that alone can speak to us:  X  X  X he archive X  X  jussive force, then, operates through being invisibly exclusionary X  X  (p. 14).

Memory practices use classification and standardization for efficiency and effectiveness. Consequently, infrastructures filter knowledge of the past. Selective forgetting is a practical necessity and a political force.
Archive, memory, and classification are tightly linked:  X  X  X he tools that we have to think about the past with are the tools of our own archive  X  so that we project onto nature our modes of organizing our own affairs ...  X  X  (p. 18). Hence, record-keeping is important. The soft technology of methods of arrangement and the hard technology used for recording, storing, and reproducing are both highly influential.

Yet again, the period 1870 X 1914 emerges as pivotal (pp. 28 X 29). There was then a peak of subordinating the human past to constructed narratives ( X  X  X raditions X  X ) and the subordination of natural history to arbitrary arrangements derivable from databases. The present  X  X  X poch of potential memory X  X  dates from then.
Chapter 1 uses the history of geology and geological history as debated in the early nineteenth century to open up discussion of time and space. Chapter 2,  X  X  X he empty archive, X  X  uses a discussion of cybernetics in the 1960s to show how closed systems and scientific theory, by establishing rules for procedural changes, reduce or eliminate time and the need for memory. Chapter 3,  X  X  X atabasing the world, X  X  takes up technology, classification, and nomenclature in the context of databases, current concerns with biodiversity, and the pol-itics of access to data.

Chapters 4,  X  X  X he mnemonic deep, X  X  and 5,  X  X  X he local knowledge of a globalizing ethnos. X  X  turn attention to problems inherent in categorizing, naming, and information integration in a very complicated world. The issues are political and economic as well as linguistic and technical. Changing a plant X  X  nomenclature can unintentionally remove endangered species protection or disrupt commercial practices. The accurate harmo-nization of data sets depends on contextual knowledge that may have been forgotten.
 The author likes to tell a good story, savors the richness of language, throws in fragments of French and German, and has an almost playful style. This, and the author X  X  erudition, can be engaging, but a price is paid.
The use of little-known words (aporias, deixis, Mancunian, orogenesis, ... ) and, sometimes, elliptical phrasing do not make for easy reading, even for English-speaking readers. We get an early warning: The book begins with a long, bizarre quotation in early sixteenth-century French, untranslated and all but untranslatable. At times we begin to miss the clarity of his earlier writings, especially his co-authored classic Sorting things out: Classification and its consequences (Bowker &amp; Star, 2000).

The author and his readers are badly served by MIT Press X  bad visual design. The text appears small and faint, especially the quotations. This book would have been easier to read with any combination of less leading, more ink, and larger type. Similarly, the cover has silver lettering barely distinguishable on pale gray cloth. The de-tailed index is primarily a name index. Chapter subheadings in the Table of Contents would have been helpful.
This is not a textbook, let alone a tutorial. It is, rather, a sustained and knowledgeable engagement with a tangle of issues. The wide-ranging scope and wealth of ideas makes it an important resource for anyone pre-suming to make statements about social memory, infrastructure, and scholarship. The richness of ideas, exam-ples, and language means that a single reading is unlikely to do justice to the contents.
