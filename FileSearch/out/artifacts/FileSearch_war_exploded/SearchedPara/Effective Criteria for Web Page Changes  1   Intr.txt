 In many web applications, administrators create and manage web databases (a collection of web pages). For example, web search services such as Google or Yahoo, create their web databases and allow users to search the databases. As web pages change dynamically, web databases become obsolete. Since the changed web pages in the databases need to be updated, administrators would like to know how significantly the contents of the web pages change. 
A number of similarity metrics for textual data have been used to measure the degree of web page changes. The simplest way to see if a web page changes is to compare web pages in a byte-by-byte level, which is used in [1, 3, 5]. Ntoulas et al. [7] used the TF  X  IDF cosine distance and the word distance. Lim et al. [6] used a shingling metric. Each of the metrics often represents the same change of web pages differently. Users may have a difficulty with selecting an appropriate metric for their specific applications. In our best knowledge, there have been no research activities to intensively compare (or evaluate) the existing metrics in terms of web page changes. 
We propose criteria for web page changes in order to evaluate existing similarity metrics. In the criteria, the changes of web pages are classified into six types (namely,  X  X dd X ,  X  X rop X ,  X  X opy X ,  X  X hrink X ,  X  X eplace X , and  X  X ove X ). We believe that the six types represent common changes on the web. We conducted two kinds of experiments. The goal of the first experiment is to show how differently the existing metrics represent the same change of web pages. The goal of the second experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing metrics with the synthesized data under the criteria. Interesting experimental results are presented. 
This paper is organized as follows: In section 2, the change types of web pages are defined, and the criteria for web page changes are described. In section 3, the experimental results are reported. Sec tion 4 contains the closing remarks. Prior to defining the criteria, we introduce the six change types of web pages. Suppose that a web page p changes to a new page p X  . First, when new (i.e., not existing on p ) words are inserted into p , we say that an  X  add  X  change takes place. Second, when old (i.e., already existing on p ) words are inserted into p , we say that a  X  copy  X  change takes place. Third, when unique (i.e., occurring only once on p ) words are deleted from p , we say that a  X  drop  X  change takes place. Fourth, when duplicate (i.e., occurring more than once on p ) words are deleted from p , we say that a  X  shrink  X  change takes place. In this case, the deleted words still exist on p X  . Fifth, when words Finally, when the positions of words on p change, we say that a  X  move  X  change takes place. Examples of the six types are given in Fig. 1. number of words on p and the number of changed words, respectively. 
The criterion on the  X  X dd X  change is defined as (x / (n+x)) , as illustrated in Fig. the user-defined weight of the  X  X opy X  change against the  X  X dd X  change. As a user considers the  X  X opy X  change more significantly (or trivially),  X  becomes higher (or lower, respectively). For example, if a user considers the effect of adding one word to be equivalent to the effect of copying two words,  X  should be set to be 1/2. If a user considers the effect of adding one word to be equivalent to the effect of copying three words,  X  should be set to be 1/3. 
The criterion on the  X  X rop X  change is defined as (x / n) , as in Fig. 3(a). For example, when n words are dropped from p with n words, the degree of change is one ( = n / n ). The criterion on the  X  X hrink X  change is defined as (  X  x / n) , as in Fig. 3(b). The parameter  X  , which is defined before, is used to denote the user-defined weight of the  X  X hrink X  change against the  X  X rop X  change. m denotes the maximum number of duplicate words on p . For example, when n words on p with n words are replaced to other words, the degree of change is one ( = n / n ). The criterion on the  X  X ove X  change is defined as (  X  x / n) , as in Fig. 4(b). The parameter  X  , which ranges from 0 to 1, denotes the user-defined weight of the  X  X ove X  change against the  X  X eplace X  change. As a user considers the  X  X ove X  change more significantly (or trivially),  X  becomes higher (or lower, respectively). (n-1) is the maximum number of movable words on a page. We have conducted two experiments. First, using real web pages, we show how differently existing metrics measure the degree of web page changes. Next, we show the effectiveness of the metrics under the proposed criteria. We compare the following five metrics: the byte-wise comparison (in short, BW), the TF X IDF cosine distance (COS), the word distance (WD), the edit distance (ED), and the 10-shingling (10SH). Markups of web pages were excluded in the experiments, as done in the literature [2, 4, 6, 7]. 
In the first experiment, we crawled Korean real web pages in August 2005 and randomly selected 41,469 pages among them. The web pages were downloaded twice in a two-day interval. Fig. 5 shows how differently 10SH, COS, and ED (the other metrics are omitted for the space limit) response to the same changes of web pages. The identifiers of web pages are sorted in an ascending order of 10SH and COS in Fig. 5(a) and 5(b) respectively, in order to clearly visualize the difference of the metrics. As the figure shows, each metric returns different values on almost all the pages. Sometimes, the difference is as large as 0.92. This experiment implies that the degree of web page changes is heavily dependent on which metric is used to measure the page changes. Users need to select an appropriate metric when they precisely measure the degree of web page changes; otherwise they would misunderstand web page changes. These experimental results motivated our study. 
The second experiment was done with our synthesized pages reflecting the characteristics on the web. We evaluated the metrics when various numbers of words on a page with 1,000 words were changing. Web pages with 1,000 words occupy about 25% on the web [4]. The changed words were clustered (i.e., not distributed) on the pages, because the changes of real web pages were generally clustered [8]. Both effective if the results of the metric are close to those of the criteria. In addition, if the results of a metric are always higher (or lower) than those of the criteria, we say that the metric is oversensitive (or undersensitive, respectively). 
In Fig. 6, 10SH is effective for the  X  X dd X  and  X  X rop X  changes, but is oversensitive effective for the  X  X opy X  and  X  X hrink X  changes. In our experiment, COS is always undersensitive. COS returns very low values for the  X  X opy X  and  X  X hrink X  changes, which implies that COS treats the  X  X opy X  and  X  X hrink X  changes to be minor. COS and WD always return zero on the  X  X ove X  change, because the metrics do not consider the changes of word order at all. WD is effective for the  X  X eplace X  change but is would be effective for the  X  X opy X  change. On the other words, WD would be the right choice for users who consider the effect of adding one word to be equivalent to the effect of copying two words. ED works similar to WD, except for the  X  X ove X  change. ED treats the  X  X ove X  change and the  X  X eplace X  change identically. 
We also evaluated the metrics when only one word changes in various sizes of pages. Each page consists of 2 2 , 2 3 , 2 4 , ..., or 2 13 words. The web pages with 2 2 to 2 13 words occupy about 95% on the web [6]. The x -axis in Fig. 7 represents the number of words on a page before changing. We show only two cases due to the space limit. Note that 10SH becomes more oversensitive as web pages become smaller. The other metrics are not sensitive to the page size in most cases. In this paper, we classified the changes of web pages into six types and defined a criterion for each type. Under the criteria, we evaluated the effectiveness of the existing five metrics. Our study presents how significantly the metrics consider each change type as well as which metric is effective on each change type. We believe that this study is the first attempt to evaluate the metrics and could be used as a guideline for selecting an appropriate metric measuring the degree of web page changes. As future work, we plan to develop a new metric that can model the criteria well.
