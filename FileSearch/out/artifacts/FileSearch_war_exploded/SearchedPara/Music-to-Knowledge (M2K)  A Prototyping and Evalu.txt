 H.3.4 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Systems and Software This demonstration introduces the M2K (Music-to-Knowledge) music digital library (MDL) and music information retrieval (MIR) prototyping and evaluation environment to the information retrieval research community. M2K is being developed as part of the International Music Information Retrieval Systems Evaluation Laboratory project (IMIRSEL). The goal of the IMIRSEL project is the creation of standardized tools, datasets and TREC-like evaluations of MDL and MIR systems. M2K plays a central role in the upcoming Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) contest being held over the spring and summer of 2005. MIREX participants will be using the M2K to prototype and then submit for formal evaluation their novel approaches to such MIR tasks as audio-based and symbol-based melody retrieval, artist identification, genre classification, etc. The MIREX participants will be meeting in September, 2005 at the 6 th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR 2005) in London, UK to compare and contrast the su ccess and failures of their techniques. MIREX information is available at: http://www.music-ir.org/mirexwiki. The computational backbone of M2K is the Data-to-Knowledge (D2K) machine learning and data mining environment developed by the Automated Learning Group (ALG) of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The D2K framework is one where developers  X  X ire X  together computational modules into programs called itineraries which represent dataflow between modules. These itineraries can then be run, or nested within other itineraries and used as modules, allowing for the development of itineraries with arbitrary complexity.
