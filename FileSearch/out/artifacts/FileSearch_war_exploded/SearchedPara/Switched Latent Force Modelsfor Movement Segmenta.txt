From t 0 to t 1 , the output z ( t ) is described by t Following the same train of thought, the output z ( t ) from t 2 is given as is forced to be equal to the output of the last interval evaluated at the switching point. 3.2 The covariance function The derivation of the co-variance function for the switching model is rather involved. For contin-uous output signals, we must take into account con-straints at each switching time. This causes initial conditions for each inter-val to be dependent on final conditions for the previous interval and induces cor-relations across the inter-vals. This effort is worth-while though as the result-ing model is very flexible and can take advantage of the switching dynamics to represent a range of signals.

We train models for Q = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 and measure the mean standarized log loss (MSLL) and the mean standarized mean square error (SMSE) [8] over the test set for each value of Q . Table 1, first two rows, show the corresponding average results over the 5 repetitions together with one standard deviation. Notice that for Q = 3 , the model gets by the first time the best performance, performance that repeats again for Q = 4 . The SMSE performance remains approximately equal for values of Q greater than 3. Fig-ures 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c) shows the kind of predictions made by the model for Q = 3 .
