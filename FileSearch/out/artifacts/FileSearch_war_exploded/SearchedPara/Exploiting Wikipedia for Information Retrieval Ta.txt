 Wikipedia -the online encyclopedia -has long been used as subject of research itself [11, 12, 23, 5, 6] . Wikipedia has been shown to be effective in recommender systems, senti-ment analysis, validation and multiple domains in informa-tion retrieval. One of the reasons for Wikipedia X  X  popularity among researchers and practitioners is the multiple types of information it contains, which enables practitioners to se-lect the right  X  X ool X  for their respective tasks. In addition to its great potential, this multitude of information sources also poses a challenge: which sources of information are best suited for a specific problem and how can different types of data be combined? This tutorial aims to provide a holistic view of Wikipedia X  X  different features -text, links, categories, page views, edit-ing history etc. -and explore the different ways they can be utilized in a machine learning framework. By presenting and contrasting the latest works that utilize Wikipedia in mul-tiple domains, this tutorial aims to increase the awareness among researchers and practitioners in these fields to the benefits of utilizing Wikipedia in their respective domains, simultaneously.
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Miscella-neous Wikipedia, Information Retrieval, Machine Learning
We propose tutorial on Wikipedia 1 as a knowledge source that leverages various Information Retrieval and Machine learning tasks. www.wikipedia.org utilized 3. Ranking -the goal of this domain is to determine the relative standing of items. Being a collaborative database, Wikipedia can be used to harness the  X  X is-dom of the crowd X  for this task. 4. Knowledge acquisition and validation -this ap-plication domain includes two tasks: a) the extraction of structured knowledge (ontologies) from Wikipedia and; b) the utilization of Wikipedia for the validation of hypothesis and conclusions.

In addition to a comprehensive review of the various do-mains in which Wikipedia can be utilized, we will also pro-vide the participants with detailed references to the various studies which utilize Wikipedia X  X  multiple features. Some of the information that will be provided to the participants is presented in Table 1.
We suggest the following outline of the tutorial: 1. Introduction to Wikipedia -a short review of its size, scope, growth rate and additional statistics. We will then describe the different application domains pre-sented in Figure 1, thus enabling the audience to iden-tify the domains that are relevant and related to its fields of interest. 2. Wikipedia as a knowledge base -we provide an overview of the various ways by which Wikipedia X  X  text, links, categories, page views etc. can be utilized in a machine learning context. 3. For each of the following domains, we provide a re-view of the domain, and the leading works in the field.
Then, we focus on a single project which requires sig-nificant use of machine learning. Projects from the following fields will be reviewed: relevant studies Redirect pages [11] [12]
