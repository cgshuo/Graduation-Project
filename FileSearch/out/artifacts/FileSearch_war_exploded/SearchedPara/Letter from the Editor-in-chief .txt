 Dear members and readers, You probably noticed that this i ssue is rather small in size comp ared to some previous ones. We nevertheless have six exciti ng contributions. In the past, i ssues of Explorations either covered a specific topic, as in a special i ssue, or compiled collections of data mining related workshop reports and re ports associated to our famo us KDD cup. This current issue does neither. In the transition from my pred ecessor to me as editor-in-chief, we did not secure guest editors for a special issue in Ju ne. However, we are di scussing some possible topics for the coming issues. Stay tuned. These topics will be announced soon. I expressly welcome proposals for special issues on any rele vant data mining topics that would be of interest to the KDD community. The special is sues are very appreciated by our members and attract significant attention, at least by academics, as attest ed to by the citations we can find. I shall report on this later. Here is a list of past special issues: I have been associate editor of SIGKDD Ex plorations since 2004 an d I have noticed a trend. We are receiving more and more contribu ted articles outside th e scope of a special issue. These are generally welcome as long as they cover problems of interest to the data mining community, and certainly enhance our periodical. Such articles are important especially for issues such as this one that do not cover a special topic. They undergo a review process and not all are accepted. For instance, less than 50% were accepted this time. I believe this trend is due to the success of SIGKDD Expl orations. It is perceived by many as an archival journal. But is it? It is important to note that articles submitted to special issues are thoroughly reviewed by a committee set by the guest editors while re gular papers are reviewed by colleagues assigned by the associated editors or myse lf. While up to three reviewers may assess a submission, reviews are admittedly not as rigorous and systematic as for a regular journal. Perhaps it is because of the quali ty of papers in the special issues, perhaps due to other SIG newsletters, such as SIGMOD records, bein g indexed with an im pact factor in the Thomson ISI index, or perhaps it is the wide distribution Explorati ons gets. The reason that Explorations has a measurab le impact. Querying Google scholar 1 for each paper from previous issues, we can notice that some have been cited s ubstantially. The most popular articles are survey papers, but other specific and technical papers are also appreciated and referenced. In the last 18 issues , ten articles were cited in th e literature more than 100 times (See Table 2). The paper Web usage mining: discovery and applications of usage patterns from web data by Srivastava, Cooley, Deshapande and Tan was even cited 842 times, a very respectable success. 21 other papers were cited between 50 and 100 times, an enviable achievement for our newsletter. This atte sts to the quality of our publications. Given the obvious impact factor of our ne wsletter and the precedence of other SIG newsletters in the ISI science citation index, I am in the process of discussing with ACM press to intervene for the inclusion of SIGK DD Explorations in the Thomson ISI index. However, it is a long process and controversial outcome. Conceivably, we should not consider Explorations as a journal, or question the role of the newsletter. For now, the role is undoubtedly not for archival and simply a means to inform members and provide relevant, re vealing coverage of pertinen t topics to the data mining community. This could be articles on novel methods, surveys on the state-of-the-art, conference reports or interviews as we had in the past. I would like to also start having reviews for books, tools or datasets as these ar e also very informative and useful to our members and readers. We star t this new theme in this very issue with one book review by Bruce D. McCullough.
 To close, I would like to thank my associate ed itors, Charu Aggarwal and Bart Goethals, to whom I am very grateful, and all the contributors of this issue. The editorial team is looking forward to receiving your special is sue proposals, your reports, book reviews, articles and other re levant contributions. Happy reading. Osmar R. Za X ane 
 Dear members and readers, It has been customary to collect and publis h in the December i ssue of Explorations reports from organizers of workshops a nd the KDD cup at the most recent SIGKDD encounters, and share experiences with our r eaders. I don X  X  believe we ever managed to get reports from all the workshops and this time is no exception. This year, the SIGKDD conference organized 12 workshops, includ ing a workshop dedicated to the KDD cup. While all organizers were personally invited to send us a report, only ten did. This is already a good outcome and those who could not come to Las Vegas to enjoy the conference or did not have th e opportunity to attend some workshops, they have now the option to read the chronicle of most 2008 KDD workshops. The workshop organizers were also invited to send us one selected paper from their meeting. Unfortunately, not counting KDD cup, only two workshops took advantage of this opportunity. The organizers of the workshop on Data Mining in Business Applications (DMBA), who did not provide a report for our i ssue, did share with us a pa per by Michael Giering on sales prediction and item recommendation. WebK DD, which celebrated the tenth year occurrence at SIGKDD this ye ar, organized a best pape r award sponsored by Yahoo! Research. The selected article from WebKDD is the winner of this award. Interestingly, this paper by Al Mamunur Rashi d, George Karypis, and John Riedl also deals with the topic of recommendation systems. more of such informative reviews. In this issu e, courtesy of Olfa Na sraoui, we also have another book review of a now prevalent book on web mining written by Bing Liu, who is a past associate editor of our newsletter a nd a recognized academic researcher in data mining and web content mining. If you would like to share your opinion on a data mining related book, please send me a short review. We would like to also start pub lishing in our newsletter abstracts of PhD dissertations in the field of knowledge discovery and data mining. These abstracts could be very informative to our general members but also, for new graduate stude nts, they could be revealing of the trends in data mining rese arch and the challenges of open problems. Coincidentally, this year X  X  SIGKDD conference inaugurated a new award dedicated to PhD dissertations. The four firs t abstracts published in explorations are abstracts of the winner, Xiaoxin Yin, and runner-ups of th is award, Jimeng Sun, David Martens and Pradeep Ravikumar. Congratulations to all of them. I would like to seize this opportunity to call for PhD dissertation abstracts for PhD work that has been defended. Depending on the number of submissions, we will formulate selection criteria to pick the best for publication. In my June foreword, I reported on the si gnificant impact some papers published in Explorations have in the community based on the number of citations they received. The citation statistics, collected fr om Google scholar, that I tried to convey in my letter draw much attention and many commented on this in teresting analysis. Among other things, I listed 10 papers cited more than 100 times in June 2008. On this data some pointed out that a number of papers were missing. In particular the paper " Tools for privacy preserving distri buted data mining " by Chris Clifton, Murat Kantarcioglu, Jaideep Vaidya, Xiaodong Lin, and Mich ael Zhu, published in vol. 4, no. 2, in 2002. In June it was cited 173 times (currently 180 times) acco rding to Google Scholar. This omission is not intentional and I apologize to the author s. The anomaly comes from a not so rare occurrence of mismatch between the paper title in the final copy and the title in the proceedings (or in our case newsletter) tabl e of contents. The paper in question for Volume 4 (notice the missing  X  distributed X  ). It is unfortunately very common that paper authors decide to make small changed to the title just before camera ready copy submission and do not inform the editors or program chairs. I was proceedings chair of SIGKDD 2002 and noticed many cases where the authors changed the title and sometimes the order or even composition of the authors X  list without informing the organizers and considering the repercussions an d side effects. A recent analysis of paper citations by Google Scholar from a list of conferences extracted from the DBLP database 1 revealed that many papers were ne ver cited. A closer look identified discrepancies between announced and final titles , exposing the fact th at this practice is unfortunately not rare. DBLP obtains its lists from table of contents of proceedings while Google Scholar extracts the title s from the on-line published postscripts or PDF files. I hope that at least the readers of this letter become consci ous of this issue and avoid changing their paper titles w ithout informing organizers. Finally, I would like to prom ote our next issue which will be a special issue on Open Source Analytics and the Interoperab ility of Analytic Applications , guest edited by Robert Grossman. A call for papers can be found at the end of the issue. Happy reading. Osmar R. Za X ane
 Dear members and readers, This issue comes a month later than usually expected. Many reasons were at work, one being the particularly early date for our annua l conference this year in Paris and some technical issues with the papers of the specia l issue. Our special issue, guest edited by Robert Grossman, is about open source analytic s and presents 6 articl es covering different trends in open source analytics, from open source software to the Predictive Model Markup Language for exchanging sta tistical and data mining models.
 In this issue we also have a report by Arpana Varde of a PhD workshop that took place at the ACM Conference on Information and Kn owledge Management in 2008. The report covers the doctoral research issues discussed at the workshop on the topics of data mining, information retrieval and database management systems. These discussions are relevant and capital for doctoral student s interested in the field. Finally, included in this issue are PhD dissert ation abstracts. We started this type of information sharing last year and continue this trend here. These abstracts provide a glimpse in the type of research conducted toda y at the PhD level in the data mining field. The first abstract is by Arthur Zimek from th e Ludwik Maximilians University in Munich, Germany, the runner-up for the SIGKDD PhD dissertation award for 2009. Luckily, and since the annual conference took place already and the awar d winners were announced, we had the opportunity to obtain Zimek X  X  abstract . We will attempt to obtain the abstract of the award winner, Jure Leskovec, for next issu e. The last two abstracts presented here are from Spain about mining evolving data stream s by Albert Bifet, and from Tunisia about mining frequent patterns with conjunctiv e and disjunctive forms by Tarek Hamrouni, giving our readers a hint on the type of res earch in data mining carried out by doctoral students in Europe and even de veloping countries. Happy reading. Osmar R. Za X ane July 2009 
 Dear members and readers, Two years ago, in Volume 9( 2) Daniel Keim and Joern Schneidewind were the guest editors of a special issue on Visual Analytic s. Much has happened since then in this young field of visual analytics and many a dvances and novel ideas were published about interactive data interp retation supported by vi sualization. In this edition, Kai Puol X maki and Alessio Bertone compile a new collection of articles in a new special issue on Visual Analytics and Knowledge Discovery. They put together six articles covering a variety of topics relevant to an alytical reasoning supported by intera ctive visual interfaces and draw you to check the papers freel y accessible on-line at http:// www.sigkdd.org/explorations/. Also in this issue we have our trad itional reports from KDD and KDD workshop organizers, various selected papers from some KDD workshops as well as two PhD dissertation abstracts. The program chairs of our flag ship conference in 2009, Peter Flach and Mohammad Zaki report on the innovati ve machine learning means they used to organize the review and sele ction process of the large num ber of paper submissions. Their account is followed by the customary KDDCup report which details the highlights of this year X  X  competition. The report is mainly on the workshop that was organizer around the KDDcup. While we had el even workshops in Paris, six full day and five half day, only organizers of six workshops reported on their events incl uding: The workshop on Statistical and Relational Learning and Mining in Bioinformatics (stReBIO09); the workshop on Knowledge Discovery from Se nsor Data (SensorKDD09); the Human Computation Workshop (HCom p09); the workshop on Data Mining using Matrices and Tensors (DMMT09) and the workshop on Know ledge Discovery from Uncertain Data (U09). Some organizers also submitted select ed papers from their workshops. We also received papers form the workshop on CyberS ecurity and Intelligence Informatics (CSI-KDD). Because of lack of space, only 5 articles are published in this issue. Other articles from HComp09, CSI-KDD09, U09 and SensorKDD09 will be published in the next issue in June 2010. Happy reading Osmar R Za X ane 
 Dear members and readers, It has been a pleasure and certainly a rewardin g experience serving as Editor-in-Chief of Explorations for almost three years and before that as Associate Editor for two years. Taking care of the newsletter X  X  matters is not a simple task and is time consuming, but I and the multitude of revealing articles we published. I hope you enjoyed and benefited from these readings at least as much as I did. The Explorations has been a success based on th e citation count of the published articles and also based on the enthusia stic submissions we regularl y receive. I w ould like to express my gratitude to the Associate Editors Bart Goethals and Charu Aggarwal for the significant role they played in this accomp lishment. Since I took over the position of Editor-in-Chief, I introduced the publication of PhD dissertation ab stracts, book reviews, and selected papers from SIGKDD workshops. I believe these have contributed in the overall success. I am pleased to announce that Bart Goethals, from the University of Antwerp in Belgium, has accepted his nominatio n as Editor-in-Chief and will take over as of December 2010. I am looking forward to reading the SIGKDD Explorations published under his leadership with a new exciting pr ogram, starting with a special issue on Unexpected Results in Data Mining guest edite d by M. Dunham and C. Giraud-Carrier. which were selected from the workshops at SIGKDD 2009 in Paris. Articles from this year X  X  workshops will appear along the worksh ops reports in the D ecember issue. Among these contributed articles are two surveys: one on the challenging task of classifying sequence data by Xing et al., grouping approaches by application domain as well as based on techniques used; and the second one on social tagging by Gupta et al., a popular phenomenon that has lately attracted significant research attention and that provides tremendous opportunities for data miners in term s of annotated data to explore. We also have in this issue two PhD thesis abstracts. These are the thesis of Mohammad Al Hasan, who received this year X  X  2010 SIGKDD Doctoral Dissertation Award, as well as the thesis of the runner-up recipient Jilles Vreeken. Happy reading.
