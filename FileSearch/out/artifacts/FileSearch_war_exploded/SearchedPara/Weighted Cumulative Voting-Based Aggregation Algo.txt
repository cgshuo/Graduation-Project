 Many clustering methods have been applied for chemical structures datasets [1-8], which are mainly used for the purpose of reducing the high costs and lengthy time needed to discover new drugs, especially in the process of High-Throughput Screen-ing (HTS), in which hundreds of thousands of chemical compounds are screened for find faster and more effective ways of discovering and producing chemical com-pounds that can effectively react to the examined disease [9]. 
There are different types of clustering methods that can be grouped based on the Jain et al. [10] organized the clustering methods into five opposing approaches which are agglomerative versus divisive, hard versus soft, monothetic versus polythetic, deterministic versus stochastic and incremental versus non incremental. Recently, individual clustering has been used versus consensus clustering. 
Consensus clustering involves two main steps: (i) partitions generation and (ii) combination using consensus function. In the first step, as many as possible individual co-occurrence based and median partition based approaches. In the first one, the idea is to determine which cluster label must be associated to each object in the consensus (for the voting-based methods) or how many times two objects belong together to the same cluster (for the co-association matrix-based and graph-based methods). There-such that each object should vote for the cluster to which it will belong in the consen-sus partition. In the second combination approach, the consensus partition is obtained by the solution of an optimization problem, which is the problem of finding the me-dian partition with respect to the cluster ensemble [11]. 
In the literature, there are many voting-based consensus clustering methods [12-is addressed through a pairwise relabeling of each ensemble partition with respect to a higher voted cluster in order to obtain the consensus partition [17-18]. 
For clustering of chemical structures datasets, it is most unlikely that any single consensus methods on sets of chemical structures and concluded that the consensus clustering methods can outperform Ward's method. However, based on the imple-mented methods, it was not the case if the clustering is restricted to a single consensus method. In addition, Saeed et al. [20] examined the use of the graph-based consensus clustering method, Cluster-based Similarity Partitioning Algorithm (CSPA) and Hypergraph Partitioning Algorithm (HGPA) [21], for clustering of the MDDR dataset and concluded that they can improve the effectiveness of individual clusterings and voting-based aggregation algorithm (CVAA) for combining multiple clusterings of chemical structures and found that it could significantly improve the quality of clustering. In addition, an enhanced voting-based consensus method (E-CVAA) was developed by Saeed et al. [23] to obtain the final consensus partition. In this paper, a weighted cumulative voting-based aggregation algorithm is developed as improve-ment for E-CVAA method by making each vote as a weighted contribution. 2.1 Dataset The MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR) database [24] was used for experiments, which consists of 102,516 molecules. The MDDR subset dataset was chosen from the MDDR database which has been used in the previous consensus clusterings experiments [20, 22, 23]. The MDDR dataset contains eleven activity classes (8294 molecules), which involves homogeneous and heterogeneous active molecules. De-which was computed as the mean pairwise Tanimoto similarity calculated across all pairs of molecules in the class. For the clustering experiments, two 2D fingerprint descriptors were used which were developed by Scitegic X  X  Pipeline Pilot [25]. These were 120-bit ALOGP and 1024-bit ECFP_4 fingerprints (more details about these fingerprints in [26-28]). 2.2 Partitions Generation The ensemble includes six partitions that were generated by using six individual clus-tering algorithms (for each fingerprint). These algorithms were: the single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage, weight ed average distance, Ward and K-means clustering methods. The thresholds of 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000 were used to individual clustering method was applied by using Jaccard coefficient. 2.3 Weighted Cumulative Voting-Based Aggregation Algorithm The first step of cumulative voting-based algorithms is to obtain the optimal relabe-ling for all partitions, which is known as the voting problem. Then, the voting-based aggregation algorithm is used to obtain the aggregated partition. The cumulative vot-ing-based aggregation algorithm (CVAA) was described by Ayed and Kamel [17-18], and enhanced by developing a weighted cumulative voting-based aggregation algo-rithm (W-CVAA) in this paper. note an ensemble of partitions, where b is the number of partitions. The voting-based aggregation problem is concerned with searching for an optimal relabeling for each tain the optimal relabeling for ensemble partitions such that n is the number of objects assigned to clusters c l i and c q , and i objects assigned to cluster c l i . 
Let H(C) denote the Shannon entropy associated with cluster C , which measures the average amount of information associated with C and is defined as a function of its distribution p(c) as follows [29]: And where N refers to the total number of molecules in a certain cluster, and n refers to the total number of molecules in the dataset. 
In this algorithm, the fixed-reference approach is used, whereby an initial reference partition is used as a common representative partition for all the ensemble partitions. Unlike the CVAA [ 22 ], A-CVAA and E-CVAA [23], the W-CVAA gives different weights to the individual clustering methods that are used to generate the ensemble based on the mutual information associated with each method, which is measured by the Shannon entropy, as shown in Eq. 3. In each partition, each compound will be assigned to any cluster with a given weight that is associated with the individual clus-same using different individual clusterings. improvements of the E-CVAA method [23] and described as follows: 2.4 Performance Evaluation The results were evaluated based on the effectiveness of the methods to separate ac-tive from inactive molecules using two measures: the F-measure [30] and Quality these are active and that there is a total of A compounds with the chosen Activity. The precision, P , and the recall, R , for that cluster are [19]: 
This calculation is carried on each cluster and the F-measure is the maximum value across all clusters. 
Also, an active cluster is defined as a non-singleton cluster for which the percen-cules in the dataset as a whole. Let p be the number of actives in active clusters, q be the number of inactives in active clusters, r be the number of actives in inactive clus-ters (i.e., clusters that are not active clusters) and s be the number of singleton actives. The high value occurs when the actives are clustered tightly together and separated from the inactive molecules. The QPI is defined to be [7]: 
Then, the results were compared with that of Ward X  X  method and other consensus clustering methods such as the CSPA, HGPA, A-CVAA and E-CVAA. The two ensembles were combined using the weighted cumulative voting-based con-sensus clustering (W-CVAA) method and other consensus clustering methods: CSPA, HGPA, A-CVAA and E-CVAA. 
The mean of the F-measure and QPI values were averaged over the eleven activity classes of the dataset. Figures 1-4 show the effectiveness of the MDDR dataset clus-tering for the ALOGP and ECFP_4 fingerprints. 
Visual inspection of the F-measure and QPI values in Figures 1-4 enables compari-sons to be made between the effectiveness of the consensus clustering methods and Ward X  X  method for clustering of chemical structures. 
In Figures 1-2, the performance of the weighted cumulative voting-based aggrega-tion algorithm (W-CVAA) outperformed Ward X  X  method using the F-measure for the ALOGP and ECFP_4 fingerprints. In comparison to other consensus clustering me-thods, the W-CVAA outperformed all other consensus methods using the ALOGP and obtained similar results to that of E-CVAA using the ECFP_4 fingerprint. In ad-dition, the performance of the CSPA was inferior to others methods. Similarly, the experimental results show consistent superior performance of the W-CVAA method using the QPI measure comparing to other clustering methods, as shown in Figures 3-4. For instance, the W-CVAA outperformed Ward X  X  method using the QPI measure for the ALOGP and ECFP_4. In addition, the W-CVAA outper-formed all other consensus methods using the ALOGP and obtained similar perfor-mance of E-CVAA using the ECFP_4. The experimental results show the superior performance of the weighted cumulative voting-based aggregation algorithm (W-CVAA), which can improve the effectiveness of combining multiple clusterings of chemical structures. The performance of the W-CVAA consensus clustering outperformed Ward X  X  method and other consensus clustering methods using the F and QPI measures for the ALOGP and ECFP_4 fin-gerprints. In future work, other weighting schemes will be examined for improving the effectiveness of combining multiple clusterings of chemical structures. Acknowledgment.
