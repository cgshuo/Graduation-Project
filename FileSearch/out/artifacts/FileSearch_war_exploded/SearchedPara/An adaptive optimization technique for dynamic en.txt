 1. Introduction
Many optimization problems must be solved in the context of a dynamic environment to provide real-time solutions efficiently. In general, such optimization problems of special interest involve time-dependent objective functions that gradually change with time. Examples of time-dependent dynamic optimization pro-blems include dynamic vehicle routing, scheduling, and threat management problems. The commonality among these problems is that the environment, such as dynamic information and time-varying restrictions, is continually changing while decisions are being made. With the intention of effectively discovering optimal solutions in real time, an adaptive approach is required that not only determines the current optimum but also quickly adjusts the solutions to a new environment when change occurs.

A number of researchers have demonstrated that EAs, as a class of heuristic search methods, offer the potential to handle such optimization problems due to their population-based search properties ( Holland, 1975 ). In the context of complex real-world optimization problems, the use of EAs is particularly beneficial because they can integrate complicated simulation models to evaluate objective functions effectively. However, as EA popula-tions converge to the best solution for the current setting of the problem, they have difficulty adapting to the changing environ-ment, limiting the application of traditional EAs to solve dynamic optimization problems. Nevertheless, various methods that extend the use of EAs for addressing such dynamic optimization problems have been developed in recent decades, including memory-based and diversity-based techniques.

The memory-based techniques are composed of implicit memory schemes ( Goldberg and Smith, 1987 ) and explicit memory schemes ( Branke, 2002 ; Yang, 2005a, 2005b; Yang and
Yao, 2008 ). The main enhancement of the performance in these schemes is the ability to store useful information from the current environment, taking into account that this information could be retrieved later when a new environment emerges. The memory-based scheme has proved highly useful for the resolution of cyclical dynamic environment problems.

Another approach to solve dynamic optimization problems is to sustain adequate diversity while the environment changes.
Several diversity-based approaches have been developed, such as maintaining diversity via random immigrants ( Grefenstette, 1992; Yang et al., 2007 ; Yang and Yao, 2008 ), modifying selection processes ( Ghosh et al., 1998 ; Goldberg and Richardson, 1987 ), evolutionary multi-objective optimization methods (EMOs) (Bui et al., 2005a, 2005b), and multi-population techniques, such as self-organizing scouts ( Branke, 2002 ), shifting balance genetic algorithms (GAs) ( Oppacher and Wineberg, 1999 ), and multi-national GAs ( Ursem, 2000 ).

Hybrid approaches are a combination of different concepts, such as memory and diversity ( Branke, 2002 ). Conceptually, this kind of approach incorporates the advantages of both memory and diversity schemes. An example of such a hybrid approach is a memory-based immigrant scheme within a GA, developed by
Yang (2005a, 2005b) , where the best solution is stored to generate random immigrants that potentially introduce the diversity of the search process in dynamic environments. Recently, a kind of hybrid EAs called memetic algorithms (MAs), which hybridize local search (LS) methods with EAs to refine the solution quality for solving DOPs ( Eriksson and Olsson, 2002, 2004 ; William et al., 2005). Wang et al. (2007) investigates the application of memetic algorithms with an adaptive hill climbing strategy.

EAs that is structured to search continually for the moving opti-mum in a dynamic environment. To avoid premature convergence and strengthen adaptability, the proposed approach attempts to guide groups of individuals of the EA population to move concurrently towards diverse promising regions in the decision space. Accordingly, at any stage of the solution procedure, a set of solutions, including the optimal and near-optimal solutions (within certain accuracy), is determined and used as the set of solutions for subsequent searches as the new environment emerges. To allow a reasonable evaluation of the proposed approach, the previously developed multi-objective optimization-based method ( Bui et al., 2005a, 2005b ) is used as a base, and the results are compared with those of ADOPT via the Moving Peaks Benchmark (MPB) problem using the same parameter settings. A detailed description of the MPB is available online ( http://www.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/ jbr/
MovPeaks ). In addition to illustrating the ability to adaptively maintain diversity, ADOPT X  X  ability to adapt to a changing environment is demonstrated through different algorithmic set-tings and problem scenarios. In this paper, the framework is applied to a groundwater contaminant source characterization problem where the monitoring observations are dynamically updated. This adaptive capability results in an effective assessment and resolution of the degree of non-uniqueness of the solutions.
The methodology is sufficiently general to be applicable to other time-dependent optimization problems in which the environment changes gradually between consecutive time steps. 2. Solution approach 2.1. Evolution Strategy (ES) for dynamic optimization problems dynamic environments due to the dynamic and stochastic manner in which the solution is evolved ( Branke, 2002 ). In addition, the ability to couple the algorithm with a simulation model of the real system enables its applicability to solve real-world problems (Branke, 2002 ). The ability of evolution strategy (ES), a class of
EAs, to adapt its step length during the search is specifically suitable for search under dynamic conditions. The scheme that is beneficial to ES is self-adaptive mutation in which each individual in the population represents the decision variables as well as their mutation step lengths ( Yang et al., 2007 ). Once mutated, the step length is used to create a random vector to mutate the decision variables accordingly. Thus, the mutation strengths progress along with the individuals instead of through predetermined values. The ES has been demonstrated to possess a self-learning property, even in the dynamic context of an optimization problem (Hoffmeister and Back, 1992 ). 2.2. Adaptive Dynamic Optimization Technique (ADOPT) mum as the problem condition changes is critical for adaptively handling the changes over time. The strategy proposed in this work uses an ES-based adaptive dynamic technique that con-tinually identifies the optimal solution for the current conditions.
The procedure starts with an ES population that is composed of a number of randomly generated subpopulations. These subpopu-lations search for a set of good solutions to the current problem conditions. The new ES-based approach to identify a set of good solutions is based on the EAGA (Evolutionary Algorithms to Generate Alternatives) method developed by Zechman and
Ranjithan (2004, 2007) , in which each subpopulation is designed to converge towards one of the many basins of attraction that expectedly include the optimal solution and a set of near-optimal solutions. To make the search efficient and effective, the EAGA approach implicitly maximizes diversity among the subpopula-tions. The solutions in these subpopulations represent the current attractive regions (with higher fitness values) in the decision space. These solutions at the current time are used as starting points for the subsequent search. As the fitness landscape of a dynamic problem gradually and continually changes as new problem conditions emerge, the subpopulations continue to evolve and collectively track the migrating basins of attraction, consequently tracking the changing optimal solution to the changing environment.

In the proposed algorithm, one subpopulation is set up to search for the best solution (with the best fitness value) that forms a benchmark for assessing the near-optimality condition for solutions in the other subpopulations. A specified degree of relaxation from the optimal objective function value is then used as a basis to evaluate the feasibility of individuals to be accepted as near-optimal solutions. To enable the discovery of other near-optimal solutions that are maximally diverse and are similar in fitness, the remaining subpopulations evolve their individuals to perform well with respect to both the objective function (i.e., within an acceptable deviation from the best fitness value) and diversity (i.e., maximally distant from the other solutions). During the selection process, if the feasible individuals are dominant, then emphasis is placed on the distance evaluation. This process ensures that an individual with a larger distance value is more likely to survive to the next generation. If, instead, the unfeasible individuals prevail, then an individual with a higher fitness value is given a higher probability to be chosen. This procedure is iteratively performed until a stopping criterion is met or a new environment emerges whereby the objective function needs to be updated. At each stage, the resulting optimum and a set of widely distributed potential alternative solutions are anticipated to form the basis for the subsequent search, thus yielding faster convergence as slight change occurs. In the case of a dynamic environment, however, the global optimum may migrate from one location to another; that is, the global optimum does not always emerge from the same subpopulation. After comparing the optima among all subpopula-tions at each generation, the one with the current global optimum then serves as the benchmark for the following search.
The proposed method attempts to achieve both convergence and diversification simultaneously. Distance, as an evaluation criterion, is expected to identify maximally different solutions; meanwhile, this algorithm concentrates each subpopulation on the basin of attraction of a single peak as quickly as possible. As a result, a set of potential solutions obtained at the current time could assist the following search, given that the resulting alternatives may perform differently for a new circumstance.
To summarize, the main steps of the algorithm are described as follows:
Step 1. Let time step t =0. Create an initial population with N subpopulations. N depends on the complexity of the problem.
Step 2. Let time step t = t +1. Construct the objective function for time step t . Set the generation as g =0.

Step 3. Check for termination criteria. When t equals the maximal time step, stop the algorithm. Otherwise, go to Step 2 and use the current solutions as the starting points for the next step search. 3. Case studies
The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm is carried out through two representative problems in dynamic environments. The first one is the Moving Peaks Benchmark (MPB) problem, developed by Branke (1999), which serves as a basis for the preliminary performance evaluation. The second case is a hypothetical groundwater contamination source character-ization to investigate the applicability of ADOPT to a real-world problem. In the following two proposed case studies, the diversity measure is calculated by the distance between one solution and the centroids of all other subpopulations. 3.1. Moving Peaks Benchmark (MPB) problem
The moving peaks function as a benchmark problem has been applied by a number of researchers investigating dynamic optimization methods. The landscape of the moving peak function includes a number of peaks, with a changing height, width and location for each peak. The mathematical formulation of the time-dependent fitness of an n-dimensional test function with m peaks is described as
F  X  ~ x ; t  X  X  max  X  B  X  ~ x  X  ; max where B  X  ~ x  X  is a time-invariant  X  X  X asis X  X  landscape, and P the function that defines a peak shape, where each of the m peaks has its own time-varying parameters: height ( h ), width ( w ), and location  X  ~ p i  X  t  X  X  . The key issue to solving the MPB problem is how to keep track of the highest location in a time-varying landscape.
The potential of ADOPT to handle this problem is investigated as described below, beginning with a comparison between ADOPT and the EMOs developed by Bui et al. (2005b).
 To assess the performance differences between ADOPT and the
EMOs, ADOPT was applied to the MPB problem using the same parameter settings as those given by Bui et al. (2005b), which are listed in Table 1 . Four problem instances were generated by varying the values for the peak height and width parameters h and w s , respectively ( Table 2 ). To solve each scenario, ADOPT was set up with 20 subpopulations ( N =20), each of which consists of two parents ( m =2) and three mutants ( l =3). The total number of time steps was set to 40, with 25 generations for each time step.
This implies a total 1000 function evaluations for each trial, which is the same as that used for the results reported by Bui et al. (2005b) . In ADOPT, a 10% relaxation target was used to search for near optimal alternative solutions. At the end of each generation of ADOPT, the performance (indicated as generation error that represents a measure of accuracy of the solution) was evaluated as the difference between the objective value of the best individual at each generation and its corresponding true current global optimum. Considering the probabilistic nature of the ES,
ADOPT was executed for 30 independent random runs, and the average and standard variation of generation error were obtained by summarizing the results of the 30 runs. On average, each random trial using these parameter settings took less than 1min on a 2.2GHz Pentium 4 machine.

In Bui et al. (2005b), a dynamic optimization with a single objective is converted to a multi-objective problem, and the methods are named as follows based on the way the distance is defined to maintain diversity: time-based, random, inverse, distance to the closet neighbor (DCN), average distance to all individuals (ADI), and the distance to the best individual of the population (DBI). This conversion is helpful for the population to remain diverse, thereby circumventing premature convergence during the search process. Table 2 summarizes the average generation error and its standard error for the solutions obtained using ADOPT and the multi-objective optimization-based methods.
DBI methods yield relatively low average generation errors. The results generated by ADOPT indicate a better performance than all the multi-objective optimization-based methods for each of the four cases. These results imply that, even though both ADOPT and the multi-objective optimization-based methods attempt to achieve convergence and diversity simultaneously, ADOPT, with its multiple subpopulations, adapts better to changing environ-ments than the methods reported in Bui et al. (2005b). certain period is limited, the appropriate settings for the size of each subpopulation and the total number of subpopulations are critical for yielding an effective performance by ADOPT. To evaluate the ways in which the performance of ADOPT varies with the number of the subpopulations and the size, a sensitivity assessment using six combinations of parameter settings were carried out, and their corresponding values are listed in Table 3 .
This sensitivity evaluation was conducted for the problem setting with the changing severity parameter values of 7 for h and 1 for w s , and for the same number of evaluations. The results for ADOPT from 30 random trials are summarized in Table 3 and are graphically shown in Fig. 1 . Table 3 presents the lowest generation error and the average generation error over all time steps among all trials for each case. When each subpopulation contains at least four individuals, an increase in the number of subpopulations yields better solutions with lower generation error values. An increase in the number of subpopulations with fewer than four individuals does not yield, however, an improvement in the ADOPT performance. This observation suggests that incorporating more subpopulations has a positive effect on the
ADOPT performance, whereas smaller number of subpopulations with equivalently large population sizes do not perform as well.
Fig. 1 shows the variation of generation error with time for the six cases. After a sharp increase in the error at the beginning where the populations consist of random solutions, generation error gradually decreases as the solutions continue to converge to better objective function values. Comparing across all six cases, in general the cases with larger number of subpopulations perform better at all time steps although the population sizes are smaller.
At the initial stage, however, the improvement resulting from a larger population size is evident. ADOPT, with its large number of subpopulations and small population size, is thus capable of swiftly identifying the optimum at later stages due to a high level of diversification it is able to maintain throughout the search.
To measure and monitor the degree of diversity, the distance of each individual from the individuals in other subpopulations is calculated. Fig. 2 shows the normalized distance among all individuals for the six cases. Again, cases with larger number of subpopulations are able to maintain, in general, a higher degree of diversity at all generations. For multimodal problems, the ability of ADOPT to adaptively diversify and maintain solutions at different peaks in the solution space helps the algorithm quickly identify a good solution as the dynamically changing optimal peak migrates over time. It must be noted that in addition to the positive results of ADOPT for the cases presented in this paper, one of the most valuable aspects of this approach is that ADOPT is Case 1 Case 2 Case 3 Case 4 Case 5 Case 6 able to assess the current status of the landscape. Accordingly, the number of subpopulations can be adjusted to match a new situation once a change occurs, resulting in less computational costs and an improvement in the algorithm performance. 3.2. Groundwater contaminant source determination
Groundwater contaminant source identification is an impor-tant and difficult step in groundwater remediation. This problem, which is posed as an inverse problem, involves the timely and accurate characterization of the contaminant source based on the observations from a system of monitoring wells in an aquifer. For a given set of observations, source characterization is posed as an optimization problem. The source characterization is updated continually and dynamically as new measurements become available, and it turns into a dynamic optimization problem. The objective of such a problem is to find the optimal contaminant source characteristics, including location, size and release history, by minimizing the difference between the simulated concentra-tion and the observed concentration at monitoring wells over time. Therefore, this objective function needs to be updated when new information is available, and can be expressed as Minimize f  X  where C sim i ; t is the simulated concentration at the i th monitoring well at time step t ; C obs i ; t the observed concentration at the i th monitoring well at time step t ; t 0 the starting time for observation; t c the current time step; and N the number of monitoring wells.

One issue in the groundwater contaminant source identifica-tion problem is the presence of non-uniqueness of solutions, i.e., more than one solution could explain the observations, especially when available monitoring information is insufficient. Thus, it is important to identify the set of non-unique solutions that fit the limited information. As additional measurements are incorporated, the set of non-unique solutions must be resolved to converge adaptively to the solution that describes the most likely source characteristics. Furthermore, if this were a real case, it would be necessary to assess whether the available measurements are sufficient, or if more information should be obtained by continu-ing measurements at existing monitoring wells or by adding new observation wells. Therefore, the source characterization must be conducted continually and adaptively until a unique solution is identified, or until the set of non-unique solutions that best fit the available measurements is identified.

In this paper, ADOPT approach is applied to solve a hypothe-tical groundwater contaminant source identification problem.
Initially, multiple populations are designed to maintain a set of alternative solutions that represents various non-unique solutions.
As more observations are added, the ADOPT solutions not only migrate to improved solution states, but also reduce the number of solutions as the degree of non-uniqueness diminishes, which accordingly decreases the number of populations. This step could be taken by comparing the similarity of solutions for different subpopulations. If two subpopulations converge to locations close to each other in the decision space, one subpopulation should be eliminated to avoid unnecessary computation. When observations are sufficient to identify the source within an acceptable accuracy threshold, the best solution is obtained from the existing population.

To begin to solve the groundwater contaminant source identification problem, a representative problem is identified such that it reflects a possible real-world scenario. The problem is kept simple enough for this preliminary study, yet it is able to generate results that illustrate the feasibility of this method. Here, the domain size is taken as 100 by 60m, and observations are simulated for 20 time steps. A single source problem is investigated; the temporal concentration release history and the shape (which is square with side lengths of 2m) of the source are assumed to be given, but the contaminant source location is treated as unknown. To identify the unknown, an optimization model is used, which minimizes the maximal absolute error between the calculated and observed concentrations based on all observation time steps and all monitoring wells. The search space for the source centroid, whose coordinate is represented as ( x , y ), is the whole domain (0 r x r 100, 0 r y r 60). A detailed description of this scenario is shown in Table 4 . For this problem, the ADOPT parameters used include an initial number of 20 subpopulations, each of which consists of 20 individuals, and the number of generations is 10 for each observation interval. Applying the aforementioned parameter settings, the computation time at the initial time step was approximately 10min on a 2.2GHz Pentium 4 machine. Over time, the computation time reduces as the number of individuals decreases.
 geneous aquifer with the contaminant introduced at a single location. Plume is generated assuming advection X  X ispersion processes in the porous media. Synthetic observations at two monitoring wells through 20 time steps are generated assuming a pulse source. Source identification Scenario 1 represents a case wherein a new observation at only Well 1 is incrementally added at each time step. Scenario 2 represents a case wherein new observations at both Wells 1 and 2 are incrementally added at each time step.

The EA-based ADOPT was executed for 30 random trials for each scenario. The representative results shown here are based on a typical run. For each scenario, the progression of the search procedure is shown in terms of the non-unique solutions obtained for each scenario as more measurements are added over time that is represented by the number of time steps in Fig. 4 . The true source is also shown for comparative purposes.

Scenario 1 has several non-unique solutions that provide the same observations at Well 1 (see Figs. 3 and 4 ). Out of the 30 trials, one of the non-unique solutions was identified 15 times.
The rest of the trials converged to multiple solutions, indicating a high degree of non-uniqueness due to observations being limited to only one observation well. Overall, measurements over more time steps were required to resolve the non-uniqueness issue. Fig. 4 (a) shows two solutions identified by ADOPT at time step 20. These two solutions provide similar observations at the observation Well 1, one of which is close to and the other is distant from the true source location. Fig. 4 (b) shows a comparison of concentration profiles at Well 1 for the true source and the alternative source that is distant from the true source; as can be seen, there is a good agreement between these two concentration profiles. Scenario 2 has, however, only one unique solution because all 30 trials converged to the correct solution prior to time step 20. Compared to Scenario 1, measurements over fewer time steps were sufficient in Scenario 2 to solve the problem as additional observations from Well 2 help resolve the non-uniqueness and identify the source correctly.

The results shown in Fig. 5 report the variation of the number of the remaining subpopulations over time within ADOPT, which 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 is averaged from among the 30 random trials. Note that if an ADOPT run terminates prior to the final step, the number of subpopulations is recorded as 1 in the following steps. The graph in Fig. 5 shows that the ADOPT procedure dynamically reduces the number of subpopulations as more available observations are become available. Compared to Scenario 1, Scenario 2 has fewer subpopulations although both start with the same number of subpopulations (20, in this study). 4. Conclusions and future work
This study introduces an adaptive dynamic optimization procedure based on EAs for solving dynamic optimization problems. Whereas the continually shifting optima challenge EAs, ADOPT is designed not only to capture the current optima, but also to simultaneously preserve an appropriate degree of diversity. To arrive at a balance between convergence and diversity, the emphasis is put on either the distance or the objective function in the selection process, which depends on the feasibility of the majority of the individuals in a subpopulation. Such balance ensures the necessary clustering of subpopulations around maxi-mally diverse potential solutions depending on the current status of a problem, the number of subpopulations is dynamically adjusted. This ability could be helpful in improving the solution quality as well as avoiding unnecessary computational costs.
Application to a 5-dimensional moving peaks function, devel-oped by Branke (1999), shows the effectiveness of ADOPT to adjust individual subpopulations to capture the moving optima. The solutions generated by ADOPT can be compared to the results of the EMOs. The effect of ADOPT parameter settings on the solution quality was further examined. Although a large population size can accelerate the convergence at the initial stages of the search, the number of subpopulations with a small population size is particularly beneficial at later stages of the ADOPT runs.
Furthermore, this algorithm was extended to solve a ground-water contaminant source characterization problem with a fixed optimal solution to a dynamically varying objective function over time, which is slightly different from a general dynamic optimization problem. In addition, this dynamic optimization problem includes an added complexity in that the degree of non-uniqueness in solutions varies over time. The results presented here demonstrate that ADOPT has the potential to dynamically identify a set of solutions that yields similar and good fit to the observed data. By varying the observations, either by utilizing longer observation periods or by incorporating more monitoring wells, ADOPT is demonstrated to be successful in adaptively reducing the number of subpopulations and assessing the degree of non-uniqueness.

The ADOPT showed an ability to quickly track the moving optimum in the dynamic optimization process. While the two case studies discussed above have a large time frame (e.g., 10 days for the water contamination) compared to the resolution time, the procedure described is applicable to the instances when the time frame becomes lower as the ADOPT offers easy parallel imple-mentation and the mapping of subpopulations on parallel processors is a relatively simple task. However, the difficulty of DOPs depends on the environmental dynamics. The future research on coupling ADOPT with local search methods or prescreening techniques (potentially reducing the search space) could significantly improve the efficiency of the method.
Although the results have shown the success of ADOPT X  X  ability to adjust the number of subpopulations when characterizing a groundwater contaminant source, appropriately regulating the number of subpopulations remains an issue. Further work is needed to examine ways to fine-tune the number of subpopula-tions in the context of various problem scenarios. The target for evaluating the solution feasibility is a vital parameter in the progression of solutions, as it controls the direction of each subpopulation. If the target is high, the selection pressure will be put on the objective function, thereby yielding rapid convergence but with a potential loss of diversity. Further exploration into the appropriate settings of these algorithmic parameter values is needed. Also, the applicability of ADOPT to more realistic dynamic optimization problems needs to be evaluated. As most real-world problems include model and input uncertainty issues, it is important to investigate the robustness of ADOPT when applied to dynamic optimization problems with uncertainties.
