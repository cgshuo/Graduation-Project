 We study a new type of workplace communication made possible by the recent advent of real-time bilingual chat tools. Because of the imperfect accuracy of real-time text translation services, this type of communication imposes extreme difficulties on user collaboration and task performance. The problems are compounded by the narrow task awareness and communication bandwidth afforded by standard chat. We report an exploratory study of users attempting to arrive at a joint understanding of a document using a bilingual chat tool. We observed many problems concerning the estab lishment of common ground and task coordination. We derive de sign implications for an improved chat tool that better supports the sharing of mental state and task coordination in this communication environment. H.5.3 [ Group and Organization Interfaces] : Computer-supported cooperative work Design, Human Factors. Instant messaging, workplace collaboration In globally-distributed enterpri ses, where far-flung virtual teams are increasingly composed acro ss national boundaries, there is a growing need to engage in collaborations that are multilingual, task-oriented and document-centric . In these situations, workers who speak different languages collaborate in real time via chat to accomplish a task whose performance involves frequent access to a document, either to retrieve task-related information or to jointly edit or evaluate the document itself. The intensive use of instant messaging (IM) in the workplace and its differences compared with more informal kinds of chat have been extensively documente d in the Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) literatures. For example, in the workplace, the number of work-related messages is much highe r than that of other types of messages, such as greeting and sc heduling. Also, task-oriented chats often revolve around work products such as documents [1, 2, 4]. We are studying bilingual, task-ori ented, document-centric chat in the context of BlueReach [5], a global expertise location and sharing service currently deployed in 23 countries at IBM. Quite often, employees speaking differe nt languages need to collaborate and solve problems, often using tr anslated documents to provide a shared background. To support this kind of collaboration, we integrated the Real-Time Translation Service (RTTS) developed by IBM Research with the IBM Lotus Sametime 7.5.1 chat platform. This tool currently s upports a variety of language pairs and translates one user X  X  input into the language of the other prior to delivery. However, initial obser vations of its use suggested a potentially high incidence of conversational breakdowns due to the less than perfect performance of the RTTS translation engine. To support this type of tasks be tter, we conducted an exploratory user study involving the use of RTTS in a representative bilingual, task-oriented, document-cen tric chat situation. This user study reveals some important issues, and to share our observations will be of value to related research in HCI and CSCW community. In the following secti ons, we will first discuss the nature of the tasks we want to s upport, and then describe the user study and its results. We next draw implications for designing chat tools of this kind and describe a preliminary prototype. Three features of this type of chat combine synergistically to make the establishment of common ground and successful collaboration extremely difficult: Bilingual . Normal, monolingual comm unication between native speakers is hard enough in a standard, narrow-bandwidth chat environment. Although the transla tion accuracy of RTTS is quite good, the inevitable translation errors only serve to amplify conversational confusions and breakdowns. Our basic research question is how can we repair or perhaps even prevent these inevitable communication breakdowns. Task-oriented . When people are chatting in order to perform real work, the chat itself can sometim es become subordinate to the primary problem solving task at hand. The chat is often interrupted for long stretches wh ile one or both parties collect relevant information, think th rough alternatives, and compose reasoned responses locally. The primacy of the problem-solving task in these situations means that chatters are in fact multi-tasking and issues of task coor dination among the chat partners become important. Needless to say, any coordination problems experienced are exacerbated by the bilingual environment. Document (object)-centric . In work-related chatting, interlocutors often need to refer to external objects, such as documents, images or maps. Research suggests that in some situations sharing information about these work-related objects is more critical to task completion than sharing information about task participants [4]. When people are not co-located in a shared space, referential common ground is hard to build. In face-to-face conversation, people liberally use deictic refere nces (e.g., this, that, here and there) to point to objects and simplify communication. However, with text messages, they lose this ability, especially when an object is being mentioned for the first time. In the user study, native Chinese and native English speakers were recruited and paired toge ther to use RTTS to converse bilingually about travel in China. The Chinese speakers were cast in the role of expert travel agents, and the English speakers were novice travelers with questions about visas, money exchange, etc. To support them in this task, both were given a short travel guide which covered such issues as Chinese visa requirements, Chinese air-travel regulations, etc. The  X  X xperts X  received an original Chinese version of this guide, a nd the travelers received a poorly translated English version. (This replicates many situations we have encountered in IBM where a sometimes poorly translated document serves as the basis for a bilingual collaboration.) In addition, we prepared five questions for the travelers to ask and placed them at the end of various sections in the document. (Example question: What kind of visa is required when entering the Chinese mainland for the fi rst time?) These questions referenced particularly ambiguous passages of the translated document, so the need to consult the expert who had access to the original version would be great. After completing their tasks, all participants were asked to finish an online survey, which asked them to reflect on their experience using the bilingual chat tool. Participants viewed their travel guides using Microsoft Word and used Sametime 7.5.1 with RTTS to communicate. We also provided them with NetMeeting fo r document sharing, but it turns out that no pair used this function. We recorded the screen actions of all participants using screen recorders. All recruits were employees of IBM Research. We collected data from 6 pairs but dropped one pair, because they inadvertently received hardcopies of the travel guides, which violates the conditions of this user study. We sent out an invitation to a representative sample of native Chinese and English speakers working in our department. Those who volunteered to participate were assigned randomly to a Chinese-English pair. No remuneration was given for participation. We collected chat histories, video screen records, and survey data from all ten participants in the fi ve pairs. As a first step in preparing the data for analysis, we transcribed the screen actions from the videos and combined them with the chat history into a single integrated transcript. For each user action, we created a separate row in a spreadsheet that included the timestamps from both the chat history and the transcribed video, a high-level categorization of the action (chat message vs. other screen action), and a secondary categorization. In the case of the screen actions, it included the categories of window switching (e.g. from the chat window to the document window or vice versa), typing in the chat window, taking some action in the document window (e.g. scrolling or paging), waiting in the chat window, window manipulation (e.g. moving or sizing), and actions unrelated to the task. For each pair, we compiled the total number of messages exchanged, and the number and ty pe of other screen actions taken. Interestingly, in this task , all participants sent fewer chat messages than they performed othe r kinds of screen actions (an average of 17.6 messages vs. 52. 7 other screen actions per participant). Figure 1 shows a breakdown of all of the screen actions for all participants. Window switching is the largest category and comprises nearly half of all screen actions (47%). The high incidence of window switching is due to the need of participants to frequently consu lt the travel guide in order to properly frame questions and/or re sponses to their partners. The window switching sometimes entrained other window manipulations, such as repositi oning and resizing (6% of all screen actions). Also, participants sometimes copied and pasted text from the document to the chat window. The dominance of window management activities ove r actual chatting underscores the high level of multi-tasking and external reference required in task-oriented, document-centric chat. A somewhat surprising result is that participants spent a fairly substantial amount of their time waiting in the chat window (this category comprises 10% of the screen actions). From the video screen records, we can see that a participant establishes focus in the chat window, moves the m ouse back and forth over old messages, or hovers in the window without typing. In many cases, the participant has sent a messa ge and is perhaps waiting for a response. Often unbeknownst to this person, however, is that their partner is deeply engaged with the document trying to find relevant information and may be occupied for a number of minutes. This was our first indication that the coordination of joint action (which is already di fficult in standard low-bandwidth, low-awareness chat environments) may be an even larger problem in situations where participants are multi-tasking and messages attempting to share information about current activities and future intentions are degraded by sometim es faulty translations. Indeed, based on the content of their chat messages and screen actions, it seemed as if, in many cases, participants had no idea what their partners were doing or planning to do. Pairs varied in their collaborative strategies, and in all cases the process was dictated by the travelers: The actions of the experts were largely determined by the tr avelers X  inquiries and responses. But different travelers approached the task in different ways, e.g., some consulted their poorly-tra nslated travel guide first, formulated their own answer, and then sought confirmation from the experts. Others went to th e experts first and only consulted the travel guide secondarily. Because of the long time lags be tween responses, some travelers adopted the strategy of pursuing que stions in parallel. Thus, after posing one question to the expert, the traveler would begin doing research in the travel guide for another question. Figure 2 shows the time spent on different questions by each pair over the course of their tasks. Different questi ons are represented by different lines, and the length of the lin e indicates the amount of time spent. (The total duration of a question was defined as the time between the first and last action associated with that question by either participant.) Figure 2 shows that most pairs pursued questions in parallel. Pair 2, however, adopted a more sequential strategy. This parallel pursuit of questions added another dimension to the multitasking we observed and exacer bated coordination problems. In some cases, experts continue d working on questions long after travelers had lost interest in them. Messages were sometimes ignored or misinterpreted because travelers were focused elsewhere.

This was done to help English analysts better understand the expert X  X  communicative intentions. over a five-minute period trying to get the attention of a traveler buried in the travel guide. The sometimes faulty translations generated by the chat tool made conversation quite difficult, especially when the topic was something as highly technical and detailed as Chinese visa requirements. Aside from the fairly common breakdowns where the translation was so garbled th at messages simply had to be recast and sent again, a number of more subtle problems were observed: Refinement failure. Often good progress was made in achieving a preliminary joint understanding of an issue, but when it was time to refine that understanding by ma king a fine distinction or sharp comparison, the precision of the translation service was not up to the task. Occasionally these attempts at refinement were viewed as off-topic and misinterpreted as a desire to change topics. Confirmation failure. Occasionally an interlocutor simply wanted The translation service sometimes garbled the message and an opportunity to solidify an understanding was lost. On one occasion a simple confirmation was recast as a question by the translation service. In some cases, the desire to close a topic and move on to the next one was difficult to communicate. Disrupted turn taking. In standard IM situations, messages are sometimes sent that are obviously incomplete; in these cases the receiver knows to wait for the rest of the message before responding. However, these kinds of cues were often lost in translation in our situation. Misinterpreted silence. According to Clark X  X  conversational conventions [3], a response of s ilence can be interpreted as a positive sign that your conversati onal partner has understood what you have just said. However, in our situation, many silences should probably be attributed to frustration rather than tacit understanding. Based on our results, we are recommending that systems for bilingual, task-oriented, docum ent-centric chat should support three specific areas: 1) direct expression of a small number of mental/conversational states, 2) e xplicit task coordination, and 3) integration of the document (object ) viewer and the chat window. In many IM systems, interlocutor s use emoticons to express their emotional states in a quick, non-textual, telegraphic way. We extend this idea with the notion of collabicons : simple, non-textual expressions of one X  X  st ate of understanding or immediate task intentions. We believe that in many cases, such simple expressions will provide the scaffolding necessary to keep the conversation from veering wildly off track and prevent grossly non-optimal coordination problems. For this to work properly, these mental status and coordi nation messages should comprise a very small, basic set and should be easily comprehensible across languages and cultures. As our study has shown, in collaborative tasks involving the intensive use of a document or ot her external artifact, users must often switch back and forth from the document window to the chat window and also adjust window positions and sizes (in our study, these two categories comprise 53% of all screen actions). One solution to this problem is to provide a sticky document viewer that is attached to th e chat window. This will obviate the need for window switching and will enable a tighter linkage between the two. Based on the results from the user study, we designed and prototyped an enhanced IM c lient on Sametime 7.5.1 (see Figure 4). In its current implementation, the client has a dropdown list to indicate one of three conversational states: On track (I understand, please continue), I am confused (Please rephrase your last message), and Off track (Let X  X  re-establish the current topic). The default mode is blank, i.e. none selected. When the user chooses a mode, the color of th e background of the chat client changes accordingly to green, yellow, or red to clearly signal the current mode and hopefully preven t mode errors. Chat messages are color-coded in the chat history to communicate the currently-chosen conversational state to the chat partner. For task coordination, we have placed three buttons beside the mental status dropdown list. They signal one of three intentions:  X  X et X  X  move on to the next topic X  (outgoing arrow),  X  X et X  X  stay on the current topic X  (circular arrow), and  X  X lease hold, I am busy working X  (VCR pause symbol). Wh en a user clicks one of them, a canned message conveying the chosen intention is inserted into the message body in the recipient X  X  language and sent with any other message text. The prototype integrates a lightweight synchronized document viewer with the chat window. Currently, we have implemented only a small set of shared annotating commands. For example, a user may highlight or underline text, and the annotation will appear on their partner X  X  screen. This allows the users to use deictic references. Users can also annotate text selections in the document viewer with text selected in the chat history. The user study we conducted is ve ry informative. It points to many possible research directions as well as ways to improve actual tool designing. The three characteristics of the tasks contribute to the issues we observed in this study. The design features in our prototype serve as examples of solutions to these problems, but we believe other designs are possible. Although we built this prototype to support multilingual chat, we believe that users speaking the same langua ge, when performing similar object-centered and task-oriented tasks, can also benefit from these improvements. 1.
