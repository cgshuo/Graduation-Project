 The Internet has become an important part of the daily life of children as a source of information and leisure activ-ities. Nonetheless, given that most of the content available on the web is aimed at the general public, children are con-stantly exposed to inappropriate content, either because the language goes beyond their reading skills, their attention span differs from grown-ups or simple because the content is not targeted at children as is the case of ads and adult content. In this work we employed a large query log sam-ple from a commercial web search engine to identify the struggles and search behavior of children of the age of 6 to young adults of the age of 18. Concretely we hypothesized that the large and complex volume of information to which children are exposed leads to ill-defined searches and to dis-orientation during the search process. For this purpose, we quantified their search difficulties based on query metrics (e.g. fraction of queries posed in natural language), session metrics (e.g. fraction of abandoned sessions) and click ac-tivity (e.g. fraction of ad clicks). We also used the search logs to retrace stages of child development. Concretely we looked for changes in the user interests (e.g. distribution of topics searched), language development (e.g. readability of the content accessed) and cognitive development (e.g. senti-ment expressed in the queries) among children and adults. We observed that these metrics clearly demonstrate an in-creased level of confusion and unsuccessful search sessions among children. We also found a clear relation between the reading level of the clicked pages and the demographics char-acteristics of the users such as age and average educational attainment of the zone in which the user is located.

Both the fraction of children using the web and the amount of time they spend online has increased significantly in the past years. For instance, in the U.K. 63%, 76% and 83% percent of users 5 to 7, 8 to 11 and 12 to 15 years old re-U.S. 32.4 million of children under the age of 18 years old were active users of the Internet in 2008, accounting for up reported in other developed countries.

Given the small amount of content carefully designed for this audience and the lack of specialized search engines ded-icated to help children find appropriate content on the web, there is an increasing need for research aimed at understand-ing the current difficulties these users experience searching for information on the Web.

To exemplify the difficulties that children encounter dur-ing the search process, consider the following two search session derived from the query log sample studied. (1) A 10 years old girl submits the query what is love , the search engine triggers advertisements related to dating and casual encounters. Thinking that this ad is a result to the query, the girl clicks on it, after spending few seconds trying to understand what it is happening she goes back and then clicks on the first web result, which explains the chemical processes involved when people feel love. The content of this website goes beyond her reading skills and she quits the search session, most likely frustrated. (2) When a 9 years old boy submits the query hun , the search engine suggests queries such as hun school (Princeton college), hun sen (primer minister of Cambodia) and hun empire (former empire ruled by Attila). Although this user is targeting the last topic suggested by the search engine, he does not seem to notice any of the query suggestions and simply continues with his initial query. Then he clicks on the first web result which happens to be a web directory of h ttp://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/ research/media-literacy/ukchildrensml1.pdf http://www.iab.net/insights_research/530422/1675/ 600835 links with adult content. Hun is also a popular term used t o refer to a specific type of adult content. The user who is probably confused by the content he found decides to go back and then he clicks on the second web result which is the Wikipedia article of the Hun empire. As it was the case with our previous example, the article is dense and its language is too advanced for the reading capabilities of this user who after few seconds aborts the search session.

In these two examples, we observed that young users have a tendency to click on higher ranked results, spend short time on each url and in general have shorter sessions than those observed in older users. Although we observed that children do use the query suggestions provided by the search engine, these are less frequently used when they are dis-played while the user is typing. In the first part of this pa-per, we quantify the struggle children experience while using a search engine using both established and novel query log metrics. Concretely, we present detailed information about queries, clicks and sessions. Details include aspects of query structure, click duration and session duration, among other features. All results are aggregated on a per-user basis and macro-averaged over age ranges that reflect human develop-ment stages. We explore how search suggestions can influ-ence the success in their search process. We also investigated the likelihood of children to click on ads and to click on adult content by accident.

In the second part of the paper, we employ the query log as a mean to retrace the stages of child development. We point out differences in the topic distribution of what users search at different ages and gender. We show that the reading level of the pages clicked also varies according to the age and demographics such as the average income of the user X  X  location.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we present the most relevant related work of previous studies on query logs and children search behavior. In Section 3.1 the data set used by us is described and the methodology followed to esti-mate the measures that we report is explained. In Section 4 we present the results and discussion of children X  X  search difficulty. Section 5 discusses our findings on retracing child development stages using query logs. Both Section 4 and 5 are subdivided according to concrete research questions. We conclude in Section 6 with a discussion of our main findings and how they could be applied.
The most relevant literature on children search behavior on the web and query log analysis are described in the fol-lowing paragraphs.
Bilal [3, 4] investigated the behavior of children using the informational tasks. The author reported that children are more successful in finding information when they used a nav-igational approach instead of keyword search. The author also reported that children are often ineffective at finding information as a consequence of frequent looped searches, hyperlink backtracking and poor query formulation. Druin et al. [7] characterized the search roles that children adopt during the search process and studied how these roles de-pend on the children X  X  environment and their motivation. Our work differs from theirs in that we quantify the search characteristics and search difficulty of children based on ag-gregated results of thousands of users across a broad age range, which makes our observations more representative on a web-scale. Additionally we report topic interest trends over a population with diverse demographic characteristics.
Duarte et al. [9, 8] compared users accessing general pur-pose information with users accessing information aimed at children. They reported significant differences between these type of users and show that some of their results are in line with previous case studies on children search behavior. Nonetheless, the authors argued that is not possible to as-sure that the users studied were children.

In [23] query logs are employed to study how search dif-fers on users with different demographics. They used de-mographic information derived from the US-census and user profile information to describe search patterns and behaviors for population segments with different demographic charac-teristics. In this work, we employed an analogous method-ology to show that the reading level of the urls clicked by children also varies across demographic features.

In [24] the authors tried to explain how the X  X ho searches X , the  X  X hat he searches X , and the  X  X ow he searches X  interact. Related to our work, they also gave details about topical distributions as function of a user X  X  age. Though we apply similar methodological techniques, such as analyzing ses-sion characteristics, the main difference is one of breadth vs. depth. With our focus on a particular demographic group, namely children, we can go into far more details and paint a fine-grained picture of children X  X  struggles and search behavior online.
The data set employed in this study was extracted from a large sample of the Yahoo! search logs of May to August of 2010. The following restrictions were employed to filter out search log data: For users below 10 years old we collected search volume in the order of hundreds of thousands of queries from tens of thousands of users. For users aged 10 or more years old we employed search volumes in the order of millions of queries from hundreds of thousands of users. As certain aspects of this data set are considered business sensitive, for various metrics we report relative differences between age groups, as opposed to a bsolute differences including, say, actual click-through-rates on ads.

The motivation of this study is to characterize the search activity of young web searchers and identify crucial differ-ences between the search behavior across children of differ-ent ages and adults. For this purpose, we aggregated entries from the log data according to the user X  X  birth year. Con-cretely, we estimate the age of the users by setting the date of birth as the 31 of December of the birth year provided in the user profiles and considering that the search was carried out in 2010. The following age ranges were created Children from 5 to 6 years old refine their motor skills and start to be involve in social games. Children from 6 to 8 years old start to expand their vision of the world beyond their immediate surroundings. Children from 8 to 12 years old acquire the ability to represent the entities of the world in terms of concepts and abstract representations. Teenagers on the other hand become more interested in social interac-tions [16]
Our selection of the age groups follows the development changes present in these stages of life. As we will show in this work, theses stages also have an impact on what children search on the web and on the way they interact with the search engine.

It can be argued that it is unreliable to trust the user in-formation provided in the Yahoo! profiles since people can lie about their age, gender or geographical location. Nonethe-less, since at last as early as 2007 Yahoo! has required the consent of a parent or legal responsible for users under 13 a symbolic amount of $.50 to confirm that a guardian is re-sponsible for the child creating the account. Apart from the (small) financial cost, the corresponding time and effort in-creases the chances of having veridical information for these age groups. Note that even if a small fraction of supposed child users lied about their true age, this is less problematic for general trends to be present or not, though the actual absolute numbers will be affected. It is also interesting to notice that in social networks, children tend to lie to make themselves appear older and this practice is often backed by parents [19].

As mentioned, we only used search and click events of users for whom we could obtain (self-provided) age, gender and US ZIP code. We then used the ZIP code in combina-with demographic estimates about their education level (the fraction of the population in a certain age range holding a bachelor X  X  degree or higher). This techniques has been pre-viously used in the context of query log analysis in [23, 24]. h ttp://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/family/ details.html http://factfinder.census.gov/
In all of our work, we take a user-centric approach as we want to provide insights into how children search online. This means that all of our statistics are macro-averages, where things are averaged with each user contributing equally, as opposed to micro-averages, where things are averaged over all query instances and heavy users will have a bigger importance.

For various parts of our analysis, we also make use of the notion of a search session . To break sequences of queries and clicks into sessions, we used a very simple approach that splits sequences of query and click events into sessions using a sliding window of 30 minutes. A similar approach has been used in several query log studies [14, 22].
For the queries and clicked documents (if any) we com-puted various metrics which will be explained in the sections where they are analyzed. However, the distinction between navigational and non-navigational queries [5] is used in sev-eral sections and so we describe here how this distinction was computed. We used two different approaches in paral-lel. First, we used the click entropy [24] to get estimates about how diverse the clicked results in response to a par-ticular query were. Queries that had a sufficient support, a minimum of 2 occurrences, were judged as navigational if the click entropy was no larger 1.0. This approach works well for head queries and, e.g. detects the query  X  X tube X  as a navi-gational query. Additionally, we used a simple heuristics on given (query, click) pairs. Note that this heuristics does not label the query as such as navigational, but rather individual (query, click) pairs. So facebook could be non-navigational if the user clicks http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook . Our heuristics works as follows: First query and url are to-kenized (by white-spaces and dot characters respectively), then tokens are sorted and plurals are stemmed. We label the pair as navigational if the query contains a domain ex-tension (i.e. www, .com, .org), the domain of the URL is con-tained in the query (or vice versa), or the edit distance be-tween the query and the domain of the url is smaller that an threshold value (in the results reported we used 2 as thresh-old for queries containing more than 4 characters). For in-stance, this method is able to detect the navigational intent of the pair (kids abercrombi, www.abercrombiekids.com/ ).
In our arguments, comparisons between (macro-)averages computed for different groups, say session lengths of children between 6 and 7 and adults between 40 and 70, are core el-ements in our arguments. Hence, we were careful to test the various differences we report for statistical significance, using a two-tailed t-test for the equality of means with un-be statistically significant if the probability of the null hy-pothesis, i.e. the two means being equal, is smaller than 5%. Recall that the averages for each group are macro -averages across the users in the corresponding group.
Query, click and session characteristics were collected to identify differences in the search process between users of different ages and gender. In the following paragraph we analyze each one of these types of metrics. Our focus here is on finding metrics that give insight into the search difficulty h ttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student\%27s_t-test# Unequal_sample_sizes.2C_unequal_variance that children face. In particular, we are interested in metri cs related to confusion .
The formulation of a well-defined query is an crucial part of the search process in IR systems [6]. The correlation between query length and IR effectiveness has widely been explored before [2, 13]. On TREC ad-hoc settings it has been found that longer queries lead to better search perfor-mance and user satisfaction [2]. Nonetheless, recent studies show that this result does not always hold on the Web-scale [6]. Query length has also been associated to the specificity of the user X  X  query intent, longer queries representing more specific and less ambiguous information needs [17]. In this work, the obvious two query length metrics were considered: token length and character length. Token length is measured as the number of tokens separated by white-spaces and char-acter length is simply the number of characters (including white-spaces) in the query.

Table 1 summarizes the results obtained by age range and query intent. A clear increasing trend of length was observed from younger to older ages. This result suggests that younger users tend to formulate simpler information X  X  goals. Given that the difference margin is larger for non-navigational queries, this result may also indicate that younger users have difficulties finding the right keywords to formu-late more elaborated information needs.
Children have been observed to pose queries in natural language given their lack of familiarity with the keyword approach of search engines. Moreover, at younger stages children typically have a greater sense of curiosity which we hypothesized is reflected in the searches they performed. The following query types were created to quantify these phenomena. 1. Question queries: Queries for which the first token is 2. Modal queries: Queries containing auxiliary verbs as 3. Knowledge questions: Queries containing the words
Age quest. modal knowl. quest. superl. for kids 6 to 7 2.07% 0.41% 0.16% 0.91% 2.36% 8 to 9 2.56% 0.29% 0.08% 1.48% 1.74% 10 to 12 3.53% 0.58% 0.11% 1.46% 0.97% 13 to 15 3.84% 0.71% 0.16% 1.33% 0.43% 16 to 18 3.33% 0.69% 0.20% 1.15% 0.34% 19 to 25 2.80% 0.49% 0.20% 1.23% 0.32% 25 to 30 2.54% 0.44% 0.16% 1.16% 0.54% 31 to 40 2.19% 0.33% 0.14% 1.09% 0.68% &gt; 40 1.69% 0.24% 0.11% 1.07% 0.31% 4. Superlatives: Queries containing superlative adjective s 5. Kids targeted queries: Queries with the terms for kids Knowledge queries attempt to measure the fraction of queries intended to fetch a specific explanation about an issue or topic. Superlative queries are commonly employed to sat-isfy the curiosity about certain topic such as in  X  X astest an-imal X . These queries were detected by looking at tokens with the suffix est and filtering out those matched tokens a locational meaning (e.g., west). Kids targeted queries are employed to focus the search on content oriented for chil-dren. Table 2 summarizes the results obtained by age for the set of non-navigational queries. Although the age range 10 to 18 has the highest fraction of question queries, the 6 to 9 years group does not have a noticeably higher fraction than, say, the 31 to 40 years age range. Similarly, lacks of clear trends over the age groups can be observed for the other features. Only the  X  X or kids X  query type came close to behaving as expected. The fraction of superlative queries peaks for children in the 8 to 12 years age range.
We collect the macro-averaged distribution of the result ranks clicked by the users. The macro rank distribution is computed by estimating the probability of each user to click at each rank position, only taking into account query instances with click, and then averaging the distributions across users belonging to the same age range. Figure 1 presents the distribution of clicks for the first five results h ttp://wordnet.princeton.edu/ Figure 1: Relative rank frequency distribution a cross age ranges Figure 2: Distribution of click length across the age g roups where all click-through-rates are relative to those of adults. A rank of  X 0 X  refers to any kind of  X  X pecial result X  which includes links to current news, shopping results or any other high quality content which is typically only shown for high volume queries. Not surprisingly we found that younger users tend to click on higher ranked results, clicking twice as often as adults on the special rank 0 results. Similarly, for positions 1 and 2 were a factor between 1.1 and 1.3 as likely as adults to click. For lower positions this behavior is reversed.
Previous work showed that one signal use to detect search success occurs in the form of long clicks . Here a long click is a click on a result such that after the click the user does not issue a new query or click on another result for at least 100 seconds. However, before the session times out (time limit of 30 minutes) he does submit another event so that the click duration can be estimated. Clicks at the end of a ses-sion have unknown click duration. We broke down non-final clicks into the three classes short (0-10 seconds), medium (11-99 seconds) and long (  X  100 second) [12]
Fig 2 shows that the fraction of long clicks is compara-tively low for children of all ages, before it suddenly jumps to a higher level for users in the 19 to 25 years age range. This result indicates search frustration in younger users since they tend to abort the clicked pages sooner than adults.
We employed the macro-fraction of ad-clicks to quantify how likely it is for an user of a given age range to click on an ad. Since not all the queries trigger advertisements, the estimation was performed only for clicks on results that were generated by queries that had triggered at least one click on an ad. Table 3 reports the fraction ratios of ad-clicks in respect to the group of adults users between 30 and 40 years old. Values greater than 1 means that users are more likely to click on ads than this age range of adults. Surprisingly, we observed higher ratios of ad-clicks for users at very young ages (6 to 12) which suggests disorientation during the search process for these users since ads are most of the time not targeted at this demographic segment. This observation is in line with previous research that showed that in the context of online games children are also more likely to click on ads as they fail to recognize them as such [1, 18]. It also reconfirms the findings concerning the position click bias from Section 4.3.
Druin et al. [7] reported in a detailed case study with 12 participants that children aged 7 to 12 often ignore the auto-completion and query suggestion facilities provided by search engines. This behavior occurs as a consequence of their longer attention on the typing instead of on the screen which make children ignore the queries suggested by the search engine. Figure 3 shows the fraction of queries that were submitted to the search engine as a product of a query suggestion or query correction. Query suggestions are trig-gered by the search engine when the user is typing the query (i.e. query auto-completion) or as the form of re-lated searches right after the user has submitted the query. The automatic query correction functionality is triggered by spelling mistakes and are commonly displayed by the search engine by informing the user We have included  X  X rit-ney spears X  results -Show only  X  X rittnay spears X  .
Figure 3 shows that, somewhat surprisingly, children are not more likely to make use of query suggestions or query corrections. However, we did observe the trend that the younger a user is, the more likely is he to undo a query sug-gestion, i.e. to insist on the (incorrect) spelling by clicking on the option like  X  X how only  X  X rittnay spears X  X . The frac-tion for users aged 6 to 7 to click such an in-correction was a factor of 1.62 higher than for a user in the age range 26 to 30. Figure 3: Query suggestions and correction usage Figure 4: Relative likelihoods of accidental clicks on a dult content websites.
Children are potentially exposed to adult and explicit ma-terial on the Web given its large volume and the lack of parental supervision. Although, we observed lower volume of queries accessing adult explicit content for users below 13 years old (as it will be depicted in Section 5.1.1) it is important to quantify how often this content is accessed ac-cidentally.

We hypothesized that users clicking by accident on a web-site with adult content would immediately go back and click on a different web result. Thus, we estimate the likelihood of having a click on a website without adult content after a short clicked on a website with adult content was registered during the same user session. Note that this process may occur more that once during the same user session. The last event of the sessions were ignored in the calculations since their click duration are unknown.

Figure 4 shows the relative frequencies for the event of an accidental short and immediately reverted click on adult content. Note that even though children in the 6 to 9 years age range have a comparatively high probability of imme-diately reverting to a different result after a (supposedly accidental) click on adult content, their absolute probability of clicking on this type of result or of issuing a related query is very low. The fact that the probability of these accidents-with-immediate correction is higher for children aged 6 to 7 than for children aged 8 to 9 can potentially be explained by the fact that the youngest children might take too long

One indication for a user struggling with a query is the fact that a user goes back to a question issued earlier in the same session after temporarily exploring different queries. As our sessions were quite short, with an average of 3.51 minutes for ages between 8 and 9 years old, it is unlikely that the second occurrence of a query is indicative of a renewal of the earlier information need. More likely, it indicates that the user has not yet fulfilled the earlier information need. We call such queries that repeated with a session  X  X uery refind-ings and their fraction is computed as follows. For each user we estimate the fraction of refinding queries inside a session (in respect to the total number of queries inside the session). Then, we averaged this fractions for all the sessions of the same user to generate a per users estimate of query refinding usage. As with all the other metrics reported in this work, we report the macro-averages across users. Similarly, if a user clicks the same URL repeatedly (which can be inter-spersed with other events) this can be seen as an indication that he is struggling and trying to make up his mind about the most relevant result.
 Apart from the fraction of refinding queries and clicks, Table 4 also shows two simple measures for the average ses-sion length, one for the length measured in minutes and one counting the number of events (queries, clicks and next re-sult page) in a session. It is important to clarify that these estimations exclude sessions containing only one entry (i.e. sessions in which a query was submitted and no clicks were registered)
Table 4 shows that search sessions of children are consid-erably shorter that for adults. Surprisingly, this statement includes the 16 to 19 age range and the jump to  X  X dulthood X  occurs suddenly in the group 20 to 25.

The fraction of query refinding and, in particular, click refinding sessions is lower for children. However, rather than to be taken as an indication for a lower level of confusion it is more likely to be a result of the fact that children have (considerably) shorter sessions and so there is simply less opportunity to issue the same query or click the same URL again.
Previous work showed that, given enough search history of a user, attributes such as gender, age and location can
Query e ntity facebook, facebook login e n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook disney cars games, 2011 cars, cars 2 2011 en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars_2 youtuyoutube, youtui, youtuyoutube en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube be estimated [15]. In this work, we looked at a related but d ifferent problem: can we find hints in the query logs that give indications about a child X  X  development stage? In par-ticular, can we confirm existing hypothesis and knowledge about child psychology?
We investigated what children search for and how this evolves along two dimensions. First, which high level topics do they search for. Second, which concrete entities do they search for and which are typical characteristics of these en-tities. In both cases we tried to link our findings back to existing knowledge about child psychology, such as the de-velopment of gender differences or the orientation of children in certain age groups towards idols/heroes.
We used a proprietary classifier to map web pages to en-queries , not pages, we then used a weighted majority vot-ing scheme on the top 10 organic results returned by the Yahoo! search engine. See [24] for details. In total, there were 95 different topics. Figure 5 presents the average topic fractions for the 11 most frequent topics searched by users below 18 years old.

The behavior of Figure 5 is intuitive. Kids have a much higher fraction of queries falling into recreation/games than adults and the same holds, though at a lower level, for recreation/toys. The interest in music is most expressed in the teenage age range (13 to 18). The fraction of busi-ness/finance increases steadily as users grow older. h ttp://dir.yahoo.com/
While we are most interested in understanding age-related differences, there are also important gender-related differ-ences, even in children [10, 11]. We were interested in how gender differences evolve as children grow up. Are gen-der differences more pronounced in, say, teenagers than in adults? To answer this question we quantified gender dif-ferences by looking at the topical distribution for particular age groups. Each such topical distribution corresponds to a probability distribution, summing to 100%. We used the 1-norm to quantify the differences between the probability distributions belonging to boys and, respectively, girls for a given age group.

The blue line in Figure 6 shows that the gender differences for children are a lot smaller than for adults. However, a lot of these gender differences are due to a gender bias in the topic for adult content. The red line shows the gender differ-ences when this topic has been removed and the remaining topics renormalized. As can be seen in the plot, this mod-ification removes a large part of the age-related increase in gender differences.

The largest differences between genders were observed in the categories business and economy, computers and Inter-net and society and culture/sexuality. Nonetheless, this dif-ferences were significantly higher for users male and females above 16 years old, which is the trend that is observed in Figure 6.
As the topics we used were fairly broad, such as  X  X u-sic X  or  X  X inance &amp; investment X , we were also interested in obtaining more fine-grained information by looking at the (main) Wikipedia entity a query refers to. To map queries to Wikipedia articles we used the following simple, yet effec-Figure 6: Average topic difference between genders t hrough the ages as measured by the || 1 || -norm Table 6: Entity fractions for Child related content and Living People according to the Wikipedia cate-gories tive approach: we ran each of the millions of distinct queries o n the Yahoo! search engine and limited the results to results from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ . The first result was then used as the entity representation for the query. Note that these queries against Wikipedia were only run fairly recently, though the original queries were submitted about one year earlier. This ensured that even for recent events almost always a Wikipedia page could be found. Table 5 shows some examples of this mapping.

An overview of the entities searched by young and adults users is presented by the tag clouds in Figure 7 and 8 respec-tively. These entities correspond only to the non-navigational queries found in our data set. Entities related to adult con-tent were also manually removed.

One of the advantages of mapping queries to Wikipedia pages is that Wikipedia pages come with a categorical classi-fication and that this classification is both more fine-grained and in a certain sense orthogonal to our own topic classifi-cation (see Section 5.1.1). For example, pages about current celebrities almost always belong to the  X  X iving People X  cate-gory. Similarly, there are many child-related categories such as  X  X arly childhood education X . We used a simple pattern match for the prefixes  X  X hild X  and  X  X id X  to identify these pages. In Table 6 we present the fraction of entities asso-ciated to children content in Wikipedia and the fraction of famous people found in the queries for the age groups.
We expected young children or at least teenagers to have a large fraction of celebrity related fraction. However, that did not turn out to be the case and the highest fraction of such queries was observed for people of college age. The trend for child-related categories was much more intuitive and, as expected, this fraction is the more pronounced the y ounger the user is.
To find out if children or adults are  X  X ore rational X  in formulating a query we looked at the presence or absence of sentiments in queries. This was motivated by the fact that children in the age range of 9 to 12 tend to experience extreme changes of mood [20], which we hypothesized could be reflected in the formulation of queries.

To assign numerical scores to sentiments being present Thelwall et al. [21]. This tool simultaneously assigns both a positive and a negative score to bits of English text, the idea being that users can express both types of sentiments at the same time such as in  X  X  love you but I also hate you X . Posi-tive sentiment strength scores range from +1 (not positive) to +5 (extremely positive). Similarly, negative sentiment strength scores range from  X  1 to  X  5. The tool works by as-signing scores to tokens in a dictionary which includes com-mon emoticons. For example,  X  X ove X  is mapped to +3/  X  1 and  X  X tink X  is mapped to +1/  X  3. Modifier words or sym-bols can boost the score such that  X  X eally love X  is mapped to +4/  X  1 (the same for  X  X ove!! X  or  X  X ooove X ). The final positive sentiment strength for a bit of text is then computed by tak-ing the maximum score among all individual positive scores. The negative sentiment strength is similarly calculated.
As can be seen in Table 7, sentiment analysis applied to individual queries did not reveal the expected trend. It did however reveal that the tendency to use both more positive and negative words in a question increases as users get older. This phenomenon is at least partly explained by the fact that they issue longer queries (see Table 1) and hence the probability of positive/negative sentiment words appearing is higher.
One of the most noticeable factors in child development and its relation to web search behavior is an improvement in reading skills. As children improve their reading proficiency they will be able to (i) make sense of a wider range of web results, and (ii) potentially understand better the various elements of a web search engine, such as query suggestions or advertisements. h ttp://sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk/ Figure 9: Reading level across age and average ed-u cational level
To retrace and quantify the improvement in reading level in our data set, we mapped clicked result pages to a 3-scale reading level using Google X  X   X  X nnotate results with reading of interest as a query to Google. In cases where the full URL did not return any results, or at least no results with an annotated reading level, we used backtracking by iteratively chopping of parts from the end of the URL, hopefully finding a shorter URL for which information could be obtained.
Table 8 gives a few examples for each of the three read-ing levels. Note that a single host such as http://en. wikipedia.org can host pages of all three reading levels. Averaged across all web pages, irrespective of the corre-sponding query volume, 51.6% of our URLs were classified as  X  X asic X , 35.8% as  X  X ntermediate X  and 2.9% as advanced. For 10.2% we could not obtain a reading level with the current approach.

We observed a general and strong trend for the fraction of clicks on  X  X asic X  reading level pages to decline for older users. At the same time we observed a weak increase for the h ttp://www.google.com/support/websearch/bin/ answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1095407  X  X dvanced X  X evel and a strong increase for the X  X ntermediate X  level.

To understand which other factors, apart from age, influ-ence the preferred reading level of users, we also broke down users according to the education level in their self-report ZIP code. Here we used the census feature  X  X ercentage of pop-ulation of the age of 25 or higher holding a bachelor degree or higher X . We sorted users according to this features and investigated the lowest 20%-tile, and the highest 20%-tile. Figure 9 shows that, for the fraction of basic reading level pages, children from well-educated areas have about 3 years of advantage over children from poorly-educated areas. For example, a child from the age range 16 to 18 has a fraction of basic result clicks of 65%. This is slightly lower than the fraction for children in the age range 13 to 15 from well-educated areas, which is 66%, and much higher than the fraction of 60% for other children in the 16 to 18 age range also coming from well-educated areas.
In several aspects of our analysis, we observed a notable difference between children and adults but often, and this came as a surprise to us, the differences between the different age groups were quite small and children between 16 and 18 behaved more like children between 8 to 9 than young adults in the 19 to 25 range. This  X  X udden jump to adulthood X , albeit not for all features, could potentially be explained by children leaving home and starting college or a job.
As far as useful lessons learned are concerned, the posi-tion click bias for children is worth pointing out. This bias also leads to a higher fraction of ad clicks and to a higher fraction of cases where (useful and correct) spelling correc-tions are undone by the user as he clicks on, say,  X  X how only  X  X rittnay spears X  X . Both of these indicate that very young users have a tendency to  X  X lick whatever is presented at a prominent position X  which has implications for the design of an appropriate search interface.

In the future, we plan to continue the line of thought that  X  X hild development can be observed through search logs X . Concretely, we would like to investigate (i) how the differ-ences between concrete and abstract entities depends on the reading level example urls age, (ii) if FSK levels of movies or suggested age limits for g ames match the age of the user, and (iii) if X  X ow to X  X r X  X ow can I X  queries and their topics can be used to describe what type of problems children are facing at different development stages.

Our hope is that a deeper understanding of children X  X  search behavior and their struggles will lead to a reduction of the prevalent  X  X ne size fits all X  search interface. In partic-ular, our work suggests that due to the strong position click bias a linear, ranked list might not be the best way of pre-senting search results and alternatives should be explored.
