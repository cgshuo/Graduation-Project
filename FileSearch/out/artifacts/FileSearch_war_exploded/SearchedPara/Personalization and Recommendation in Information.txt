 1. Introduction
The goal of enhancing Information Retrieval (IR) models and methods towards user-aware and context-aware models has raised increasing interest in the research community, and is being identified as a key step in order to cope with the contin-uous growth of information environments (repositories, networks, users) worldwide. The notion of context refers to any dy-namic condition occurring at the time when an information retrieval task takes place, and which may be relevant to fully define and understand a user need. When the notion of context focuses on persistent user characteristics and preferences, it is usually referred to as an issue of personalization.

A significant body of research in the last two decades has paid attention to the problem of personalizing information ac-cess and delivery, commonly addressed under such names as information filtering, collaborative filtering, recommender sys-tems, or personalized IR, with variations in approach and perspective. From different angles, the problem has been a major research topic in fields such as IR, User Modeling, and Machine Learning. In general, personalizing the retrieval of content involves knowing something about the user beyond her last request, and taking advantage of this knowledge in order to improve the system response to the actual user need. In an increasingly demanding and competitive market, room for such improvement exists often nowadays, to varying degrees, in common retrieval scenarios, either because the request is vague or because there is no explicit request at all. The research activity in this area has been paralleled by a comparable interest towards making such techniques commercially profitable.

The concept of Recommender System (RS) is a broader term that combines typical features related to personalization and context. They were born as a solution to the huge amount of information the users can find on the Internet. RSs are appli-cations that give advice to the user about items (movies, music, clothes, news, scientific literature, etc.) that are likely of interest to the user, according to their preferences and tastes. The system usually compares the user X  X  profile with some information extracted from the item (content-based recommendation), or from other users who have similar preferences (collaborative recommendation).

Personalization remains a hot topic in Information Access research and industry. Important problems are yet to be solved in order to achieve the quality, reliability and maturity required for a widespread deployment of these techniques. Person-alization systems often fail to acquire enough or sufficiently accurate knowledge about users, as finding implicit evidence of user needs and interests through their behavior is not an easy task. Inherent difficulties are involved indeed when attempt-ing to deal with (or even define) aspects related to human cognition and volition. Even when the system assumptions are correct, the adaptive actions can be obtrusive or inappropriate, if not handled properly. Coping with the dynamics of user interests (e.g. persistent vs. occasional), the different time scales on which they evolve (e.g. slow persistent changes, quick temporal changes), the interrelations among different time windows (e.g. a temporal interest becoming persistent, a long-term preference coming into play, etc.), the multiple sides or user preferences, or the relations between preference and sit-uation, are some of the challenging problems in this area.

The moment seemed timely to call for a selection of relevant contributions and innovative research focusing on the topics of personalization and recommendation in information access, which motivates the present Special Issue of Information Pro-cessing &amp; Management. After a long reviewing and selection process, the Special Issue finally comes to light. 2. Papers included in the special issue
The Special Issue on Personalization and Recommendation in Information Access includes a selection of articles address-ing representative topics in the presented scope. The call for papers for the Special Issue received 53 submissions, of which six were accepted (11% acceptance ratio). We briefly introduce next the accepted papers, published in this issue. The first two papers focus on the representation, construction and enhancement of user profiles. Silvia Calegari and
Gabriella Pasi present in Personal Ontologies: generation of user profiles based on the YAGO Ontology a novel approach to build user profiles for personalized search tasks. The authors propose the use of ontologies to build such profiles, rather than a traditional bag-of-words approach. Data collected by monitoring users is processed by knowledge extraction techniques and integrated with YAGO, a general purpose ontology, resulting in a personal ontology that represents the user X  X  interests.
The approach is evaluated in two complementary perspectives: the quality of the information stored in the personal ontol-ogy, i.e. the level of noise it contains (quantitative evaluation); and the quality of the structure of the obtained personal ontology represented as a graph (qualitative evaluation).

Vreixo Formoso, Diego Fern X ndez, Fidel Cacheda and V X ctor Carneiro present in Using Profile Expansion to alleviate the new user problem a method using relevance feedback to improve the quality of the user profile by means of its expansion, with the aim of reducing the impact of the new user problem in Collaborative Filtering (CF). The underlying idea of the contri-bution is to expand the profile by including new items in situations where the user is still new in the system and has not yet rated sufficient items for the direct application of state of the art CF techniques. The information to expand the pro-files is drawn from different sources: from items already rated by the user and included in her profile, to previously recom-mended items, including the items rated by similar users in the active user X  X  neighborhood. The approach is evaluated on the
Netflix and MovieLens datasets and the reported results shows the effectiveness of profile expansion in the top-N recom-mendation task.
 The next two articles take a collective view on users for recommendation purposes. A Group Recommender on Movies
Based on Content Similarity and Popularity , by Maria Soledad Pera and Yiu-Kai Ng, presents an example of movie recommen-dation in terms of the joint preferences of a group of people. The authors propose a top-N recommender system based on a content-based approach to select the relevant items, but in this case the data used to perform recommendations are tags, extracted from social websites, and bookmarks from users composing the group. With this information, the system is able to capture the content of movies of interest, as well as a representation of the preferences of the group. The ranking of items for recommendatoin is created by combining the similarity of the movies with respect to a group as well as the popularity scores of the former. The experimentation designed with a large number of groups shows performance enhancements, improving the results obtained by group recommendation techniques in prior work.

Ismail Altingovde, Ozlem N. Subakan and  X zg X r Ulusoy present a cluster-based approach to CF in Cluster Searching Strat-egies for Collaborative Recommendation Systems . The proposed approach builds clusters of users, and compares the ratings provided by the closest users within the cluster (cluster representatives), rather than the whole cluster, to produce recom-mendations. The method is supported by an efficient data structure, referred to as a cluster-skipping inverted index. Empir-ical evaluation on the EachMovie dataset compares the presented approach to classic CF and alternative cluster-based methods, showing the efficiency of the proposed individualistic strategy, without detriment to the recommendation accuracy.
 Improving the Predictive Ability of Top-N Recommender Systems , by Marcos Aur X lio Domingues, Al X pio M. Jorge and Carlos
Soares, offers an example of how context can be integrated in the recommendation process. The article presents a new ap-proach to the top-N recommendation problem in the context of multidimensional recommender systems, where the tradi-tional user-item information available to these applications is augmented with the so called  X  X irtual items X . The proposed multidimensional data model is based on the exploitation of contextual and background information. More specifically, the user-item pairs are enriched with new dimensions, such as time and location, and incorporated to the recommendation model. Experiments with real world datasets are presented where the proposal is compared to state-of-the-art models, con-cluding that the inclusion of the proposed dimensions in the top-N recommendation task helps improve the performance of classic models.

Finally, Jie Zhang, Yuan Wang and Julita Vassileva show an example of data source aggregation for enhanced recommen-dation in SocConnect: A Personalized Social Network Aggregator and Recommender , focused in the context of social networks.
Considering, on the one hand, the difficulty involved in tracking activities across social networks, the massive amount of social data produced by users, and the potential resulting information overload, the personalized recommendation of activ-ities becomes a challenge. The authors present an approach to connect social networks, integrating the social data generated in each one of them and allowing the users to create different friendship contexts. With this information, the proposed sys-tem learns user preferences, and recommends new friends X  activities of potential interest which, until this moment, were totally unknown for them. A prototype of the system is evaluated in a user study on Facebook and Twitter, providing empir-ical support for the proposed aggregation-recommendation functionalities.
