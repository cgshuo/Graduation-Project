 Automatic text summarization [1] that provides users with a condensed version of the original text, tries to release our reading burden, and most summarization today still relies on extraction of sentences from the original document [2]. In extractive summa-rization, a proper arrangement of these extracted sentences must be found if we want to generate a logical, coherent and readable summary. This issue is special in multi-document summarization. Sentence position in the original document, which yields a good clue to sentence arrangement for single-document summarization, is not enough for multi-document summarization because we must consider inter-document order-ing at the same time [3]. 
Barzilay et al. [4] showed the impact of sentence ordering on readability of a sum-mary and explored some strategies for sentence ordering in the context of multi-document summarization. Lapata [5] proposed another method to sentence ordering based on an unsupervised probabilistic model for text structuring that learns ordering constraints from a large corpus. However, the limitation of above-mentioned strate-gies is still obvious. Barzilay X  X  strategy paid attention to chronological and topical relation whereas ignored sentence original ordering in the articles where summary comes from. Hence, if the articles are not event-based, the quality of summary will decrease because the temporal cue is invalid. As for Lapata X  X  strategy, the probabilis-tic model of text structure is trained on a large corpus, so it performs badly when genre of the corpus and the article collection are mismatched. 
To overcome the limitation mentioned above, we propose a hybrid model for sen-tence ordering in extractive multi-document summarization that combines four rela-tions between sentences -chronological relation, positional relation, topical relation and dependent relation. Our model regards sentence as vertex and combined relation as edge of a directed graph on which the approximately optimal ordering can be gen-erated with PageRank analysis. Evaluation of our hybrid model shows a significant improvement of the ordering over strategies losing some relations and the results also indicate that this hybrid model is robust for articles with different genre. For the group of sentences extracted from the article collection, we construct a di-the set of vertices V and set of directed edges E , where E is a subset of VV  X  . For a Out( v i ) be the set of vertices that vertex v i points. In our hybrid model, the Precedence Graph is constructed by adding a vertex for each sentence in the summary, and edges between vertices are established using sentence relations. Three of the pre-defined quantitative relations are integrated to precedent relation using linear model. chronological relation , ij C individually. If R i,j &gt;0, there exist a directed edge with value R from v i to v j (see figure 1). In our case, we set P  X  =0.3, D  X  =0.4, C  X  =0.3 manually. By the way, figure 1 does not contain topical relation because it will be used only after the first vertex has been selected. Unfortunately, the next critical task of finding an optimal road according to the Precedence Graph is a NP-complete problem. Our model employs PageRank method [6], which is perhaps one of the most popular ranking algorithms, and was designed as a method for Web link analysis. PageRank method is a graph-based ranking algo-rithm to decide the importance of a vertex within a graph, by taking into account global information recursively computed from the entire graph, rather than relying only on local vertex-specific information. Score of vertex v i is defined as: where d is a parameter set between 0 and 1 (we let d=0.1 in our experiments). 
The next step following PageRank algorithm is the selection of vertex. We first se-lect the vertex with highest score as the first sentence in summary. For the following vertices, not only the score itself but also the topical relation with immediately previ-ous vertex should be taken into consideration. The succeed vertex of v k should satisfy: When the succeed vertex of v k is picked up, vertex v k and all edges linked with it are deleted from the Precedence Graph. This operator iterate until the graph is empty, and then an ordered summary is produced. We collected three groups of summaries generated by three different participants of task 2 in DUC2004 [7]. Three selected groups have high (id=65), fair (id=138), and low (id=111) ROUGE score [8] individually so that we can observe the degree of influence that our model affects on summarizer with different performance. For each group, we randomly selected 10 from 50 summaries produced by one participant. Five postgraduates were employed and everyone built one ordering manually for each summary. To test the adaptive performance of our hybrid model, we also randomly selected the fourth group of testing data from DUC2005, which has different genre with DUC2004. rankings, to measure the distance between two ranking. interchanges of consecutive elements necessary to arrange them in their natural order-ing (manual ordering in this case). If we think in terms of permutations, then  X   X  can be interpreted as the minimum number of adjacent transpositions needed to bring one ordering to the other. We use the minimal one from 5 distance values corresponding to the 5  X  X deal X  orderings produced manually. Figure 2 shows the evaluation results. 
As Figure 2 indicates, our hybrid ordering (HO) model yields more satisfactory re-sult (as a whole) than any other model taking part in the comparison, including the strategy employed by the summarizer that produces the original ordering (OO). Al-though partially hybrid strategies such as HO-C (hybrid ordering model without chronological relation), HO-P (hybrid ordering model without positional relation), HO-T (hybrid ordering model without topical relation, and HO-D (hybrid ordering model without dependent relation) are all worse than HO, we found that different relation has significantly different influence on the ordering strategy performance. In context of DUC2004 dataset (group 1, 2, 3), HO-C performs worst and HO-T is slightly better than HO-C, whereas there aren X  X  significant difference between HO-P, HO-D, and HO. In other word, the ordering strategy depend more on chronology and topical relation than on positional an d dependent relation for DUC2004 dataset. After investigating the failure ordering of HO-C, we found that most of the articles have been used for task 2 in DUC2004 are event-based, so chronological cue is very impor-tant for ordering. Moreover, for the limitation of summary length, number of sentences in most summaries is less than 10  X  the number of articles from which sum-mary extracted, so the probability of two sentences coming from the same article is very low. Hence the importance of positional relation is not distinct. 
On the contrary, HO-T and HO-P perform much worse than HO on DUC2005 dataset (group 4) while HO-D and HO-C perform closely to HO. Reason for this change is that most articles for DUC2005 are biography, where chronological cue is not so important for ordering. Although different relation plays different role in order-ing summary with different genre, our hybrid model combining these relations to-gether has robust performance. Figure 2 indicates clearly that the results of HO have no distinct change when article genre change from event-based to biography-based. Furthermore, after reordering, the improvement for  X  X oor X  summaries (group 3) is better than for  X  X ood X  summaries (group 1) because the summaries generated by a good summarizer are more readable than by bad one. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model for sentence ordering in extractive multi-document summarization. We combine the four relations between sentences using a linear model and we call it precedent relation. To find a proper ordering for the group of sentences extracted from an article collection, our hybrid model regards sentence as vertex and precedent relation as edge of a directed graph, and employs PageRank analysis method to generate an approximately optimal ordering. We evaluate the automatically generated orderings against manual orderings on the testing dataset extended from DUC2004 and DUC2005. Experiment results show that the hybrid model has a significant improvement compared with other partially hybrid model. Moreover, experiment results on DUC2004 dat aset and DUC2005 dataset indicates that our hybrid model is robust for articles with different genre.
