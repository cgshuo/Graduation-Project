Community detection is helpful to improve user-oriented services analysis importance of nodes [7], and other applications. 
At present, most existing community detection algorithms are designed to find densely connected groups of nodes from only one single graph in which nodes represent actors and edges indicate only a relatively homogenous relationship (such as relationships. These various kinds of relationship types usually jointly affect people X  X  social activities [9]. One way to model multi-relational social networks is to use mul-of relationship type. Of course, a multi-relational social network can also be modeled Although existing community detection algorithms for single-relational networks communities obtained may overlook much information that would be crucial to fully understand phenomena taking place in networks. Thus, it is necessary to develop community detection algorithms that are su itable for multi-relational social networks. 
Unfortunately, the inclusion of multiple relationship types between nodes compli-edges being  X  X qual, X  the executing algorithm just need to be concerned with the exis-tence of an edge in a graph. In a multi-relational social network, on the other hand, the inter-dependencies and feedbacks between multiple relational interactions are signifi-cant [11], community detection algorithms must take the existence of an edge in mul-tiple graphs into account in order to obtain meaningful results. partitioning with respect to the set of all nodes in a multi-relational network. This parti-cooperative behaviors of groups of rational players and analyze the formation of coali-who cooperate to each other to form coalitions for improving the group X  X  gains, while the gains are limited by the costs for forming these coalitions. In social network envi-ronments, behaviors of actors are not independent [13], and joining a community pro-vides one with tremendous benefits, such as members feel rewarded in some way for their participation in the community, and gaining honor and status for being members [14]. Therefore, every actor shall have the incentive to join communities. However, in munities [15]. As a consequence of this fact, we believe that coalition formation game theories are promising tools that could be used for detecting communities. 
In the approach proposed in this paper, we first model the process of multi-social network are modeled as rational players trying to achieve and improve group X  X  players can merge into a larger coalition as long as the merge operation can contribute actually illustrates the process of forming the hierarchy structures amongst coalitions. and reflect the concept of  X  X verlapping communities X . gain function measures the degree of the interaction amongst the players inside a coa-lition, while the cost function instead represents the degree of the interaction between the players of the coalition and the rest of the network. 
Next, we develop a greedy agglomerative manner to identify multi-relational relational network until no pairs of coalitions are merged. This greedy agglomerative manner does not require a priori knowledge on the number and size of the communi-ties, and it matches the real-world scenar io, in which communities are formed gradu-ally from bottom to top. 
Finally, we conduct experiments on synthetic networks to quantitatively evaluate proposed algorithm. We compare our multi-relational community structure with the community structures from the single-relational graphs. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method. 
In summarize, the main contributions of this paper are as follows: neath different interactions rather than any one of single-relational graphs or the union graph, so they represent a more global structure and can be easily unders-tood. relational communities is presented, in which a utility function for modeling the benefit and cost of each coalition from forming this coalition is introduced.  X  A greedy agglomerative manner is propos ed to identify communities. The pro-posed manner does not require a priori knowledge on the number and size of communities. mance studies verify the effectiveness of our approach. section 3 presents a coalition formation game theory-based approach for detecting multi-relational communities. The experimental results are presented in section 4, and section 5 concludes this paper. So far, community detection in single-relational networks has been extensively stu-died and many approaches have been proposed [16]. Of which, the modularity-based method proposed by Newman and Girvan [17] is a well known algorithm. To optim-named the Louvain Method that allows detecting communities quickly and efficiently with enlightening results in large networks. Aynaud and Guillaume [19] modified the Louvain Method to detect multi-step communities in evolving networks. 
To detect communities in multi-relational so cial networks, Cai et al. [9] proposed a threshold cut as the optimization objective fo r community detection. Str X ele et al. [8] used clustering techniques with maximum flow measurement to identify the social weights of various relation types and actors simultaneously, and then they combined work and presented a Gaussian mixture model with neighbor knowledge to discover clustering to discover communities. A common way adopted by above works is to single-relational network algorithms to detect communities. 
It is worthy to mention that Li n et al. [22], Zhang et al. [23] and Li et al. [24] also studied community detection problem in multi-relational networks that contain more but just one typed entities. Game theories [25,26] have been used to solve community detection problems. or leave based on its own utility measurement. Alvari et al. [27] considered the forma-tion of communities as an iterative game in which each actor is regarded as a player trying to be in the communities with member s such that they are structurally equiva-lent. Lung et al. [28] formulated the community detection problem from a game theory point of view and solved this problem by using a crowding based Differential Diffusion Model and Shapley Value Concept to address the community detection there is no one member receives lower Shapley Value than that it receives from other these methods are developed for single-relational networks. graphs, each of them representing the interac tions amongst actors in a given relationship. who cooperate to each other to form coalitions for improving the group X  X  gains, while the gains are limited by the costs for forming these coalitions. Coalitions with fewer players process of forming the hierarchy structures amongst communities. Meanwhile, each player is allowed to join multiple coalitions, which could capture and reflect the concept of  X  X verlapping communities X . to detect and identify coalitions over multiple single-relational graphs such that these network by merging with other coalitions. duce the algorithm for detecting multi-relational communities. 3.1 Definitions Let the multi-relational network on a set of relations be be an undirected graph with nodes (actors) and edges (interactions), representing the interactions amongst actors in the relation , be the rela-tion index.

The gain function is the ratio of edges inside over the total degree of the nodes inside in ; the cost function instead represents the ratio of the total degree in means that there are more interactio ns amongst the actors inside in the actors of the coalition and the rest of the network .

They are the sum of the gain function and the cost function of with respect to , nodes and edges in this single-relational graph, while the is defined on mul-tiple single-relational graphs. Definition 3. Stable coalition. A coalition is regarded as a stable coalition if can not further improve its utility by merging with other coalitions, i.e. , grand coalition [12] if , i.e, the coalition of all the actors, while is called as a trivial coalition if just consist of a single node, i.e, .

This is natural be-neighbors (coalitions that have links between them), without an exhaustive search over the entire network. The condition implies that the utilities of and should be improved through the merge operation. It ensures that a coalition formed by a merge operation has greater utility than that of its subsets. The unilateral meet of two inequalities shows that two coalitions fail to reach an agree-ment to cooperate, for example, the case of but suggests that intends to cooperate with but may not agree. Definition 5. Stable coalition structure. A collection of coalitions is regarded as a stable coalition structure if holds. tions, in which no group of individuals has an interest in performing a merge operation any further. In this paper, a stable coalition structure is called as a multi-relational community structure of , and a coalition of is called as a multi-relational community of . 
Given a multi-relational network , detecting multi-relational communities means finding a stable coalition structure in which no group of actors has an interest in performing a merge operation any further. 3.2 An Algorithm for Detecting Multi-relational Communities In this study, we develop a greedy agglomerative manner to identify multi-relational communities. The main idea of the greedy agglomerative manner is to start from the until no such merge operation can be performed any further. Now, the number of coalitions represents the number of communities in . Hence, the number and size pseudo-code for the greedy agglomerative algorithm is given in MRgame algorithm.

In a single graph, the time complexity of MRgame algorithm is at worst case. Note that, iterations are an upper bound and the algorithm will terminate as soon as no pair of coalitions would be merged any further. It is possible multi-relational network, MRgame searches neighbors for each node over multiple relational communities in multi-relational social networks. Typically, a real-world network thetic network contains nodes which roughly form communities containing probability , while nodes with different membership connect randomly with each ( ) may differ with respect to groups at distinct relations.
