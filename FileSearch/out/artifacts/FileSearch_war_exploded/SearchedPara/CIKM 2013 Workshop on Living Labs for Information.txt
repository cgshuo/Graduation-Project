 In the past few years the information retrieval (IR) com-munity has been exploring ways to move further away from the Cranfield style evaluation paradigm, and make evalu-ations more  X  X ealistic X  (more centered on real users, their needs and behaviours). As part of this drive, living labs which involve and integrate users in the research process have been proposed. The Living Labs for Information Re-trieval Evaluation workshop (LL X 13) brings together for the first time people interested in progressing the living labs for IR evaluation methodology.

In the past few years, a new evaluation methodology known as living labs has been proposed as a way for researchers to be able to perform in-situ evaluation which involve and in-tegrate users within the research process. The basic idea of living labs is that a central and shared environment re-source is used rather than individual research groups having to develop their own experimental environment and their own individual set of experiment subjects.

Living labs would offer huge benefits to the community, such as: availability of, potentially larger, cohorts of real users and their behaviours, e.g. querying behaviours, for ex-periment purposes; cross-comparability across research cen-tres; and greater knowledge transfer between industry and academia, when industry partners are involved. The need for this methodology is further amplified by the increased reliance of IR approaches on proprietary data; living labs are a way to bridge the data divide between academia and industry. Progress towards realising actual living labs has nevertheless been limited. There are many challenges to be overcome before the benefits associated with living labs for IR can be realised, including challenges associated with living labs architecture and design, hosting, maintenance, security, privacy, participant recruiting, and scenarios and tasks for use development.

The workshop brings together for the first time people interested in progressing the living labs for IR evaluation methodology, with the explicit goal of formulating practi-cal next steps for development. Issues concern implementa-tion options, how to make the idea of living labs attractive to commercial organisations, alternatives when commercial providers will not get involved, coping with data privacy issues, and tasks and usage scenarios.

The workshop called for short papers (4 pages), position papers (2 pages), and demo papers (4 papers), which were reviewed by a program committee. In addition to the regular paper presentations, the programme includes an invited talk by Jan Pedersen (Microsoft Bing). We dedicate a separate track to demo submissions that showcase innovative proto-types or practical developments that are rooted in real-world applications. The workshop is intended to be highly interac-tive to encourage group discussion and active collaboration among attendees; multiple breakout sessions are scheduled throughout the day. A final discussion session wraps up the event with the objective to identify and formulate specific action items for future research and development.
 The workshop is supported by the  X  X valuating Information Access Systems X  (ELIAS) ESF Research Networking Pro-gramme.
