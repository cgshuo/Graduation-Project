 Over the last few years, Flickr has gained massive popularity and groups in Flickr are one of the main ways for photo diffusion. However, the huge volume of groups brings troubles for users to decide which group to choose. In this paper, we propose a tensor decomposition-based group recommendation model to suggest groups to users which can help t ackle this problem. The proposed model measures the latent associa tions between users and groups by considering both semantic tags a nd social relations. Experimental results show the usefulne ss of the proposed model.

Flickr Group, Tensor Decomposition, Group Recommendation. Flickr offers a number of ways for users to browse and find photos, such as exploring or searching through members, tags, groups or interesting photos. Groups in Flickr are self-organized communities to share photos and conversations with common interests. As groups are self-organized, plenty of groups fall into a similar topic, i.e. 22,183 groups are returned by searching with the keyword cat . Indeed, people need an easy-to-use tool to guide their selection. In this paper, we provide a gr oup recommendation model to help people more easily engage in group activities. Typically, only group members can contribute to a group pool. A user attaches tags to a photo a nd shares it with one or several suitable groups. Semantic relations among tags could be detected by their overlaps in groups or users. The joint patterns of two users can be denoted by their semantic tag usage and similar groups involved. Similarly, the joint patterns of two groups can be expressed by semantic tags co-occurrence and the number of users who participated in both groups. However, the multiple facets introduce challenges of modeling, as a result, most prior work has focused on specific points, such as applyi ng two-mode relations: group-tag, user-tag or group-user [1,2] or incorporating data into two dimensions [3] to construct topi c models. Although th ese models are effective by considering semantic data like tags or social data like group membership respectively, it may bring better performance if integrating all these information t ogether. As tensor model offers a natural representation for multiple facets, we propose a tensor decomposition-based group recommendation model in this paper to combine semantic tags with social relations. In the following of this article, we will illustrate the details of this model, along with the experimental results. The idea of group recommendation is to suggest groups which may have latent associations with th e active user. We provide a small example shown in Figure 1 to illustrate the benefits of three modes compared with two modes. In the two-mode relations (on the left), we cannot find any associations between user U 1 and group G while in the three-mode relations (on the right), tags perform as a bridge between users and groups. We can see that U association with G 3 through tag T 1 . From Figure 1, a three-mode tensor Z I JN  X  X   X  R can be constructed from the usage data, where I, J, N are the numbers of users, tags and corresponding photo count with tag j in group n . The advantage of a three-way tensor is that we can explicitly model the relations among users, tags and groups in a unified way. We employ CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition [4] to capture the underlying patterns in the user-tag-group tensor. The basic idea of the CP decomposition is to fit component rank-one tensors, such that where the symbol o denotes the outer product, R is the decomposed rank of the tensor, r  X  is a weight that indicates how important the r -th component is, and vectors I r  X  a R , J r  X  b R and N Combining the vectors from the rank-one components, we get three factor matrices: user matrix A , tag matrix B and group matrix C of size I  X  R, J  X  R, N  X  R respectively. The advantages of the CP model lie in: (i) the model transf orms rich relations among users, tags and groups into R components, which present the principal axes of entities across the three modes and (ii) the results project users, tags and groups to the same R components, which reduces dimensions and brings conveniences for further applications based on such a model. Specially, we compute the non-negative CP decomposition by multiplicative updates like non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) adopted [5] by using the Tensor Toolbox. Such an approach could retain the non-negative characteristics of the original data which facilitates easier interpretation. Three factor matrices discover the latent topics that govern the associations among users, tags and groups. The i -th row of user matrix A provides an additive linear combination of components which indicate the topics of user i . The higher weight user i is assigned to a component, the more interested user i is in the relevant topic. The n -th row of group matrix C provides an additive linear combination of components that indicate the topics of group n . The higher weight a group is assigned to a component, the more related the group is with the relevant topic. Thus, groups can be recommended according to the captured associations. We define a score matrix S of size I  X  N as follows: S measures the latent associati ons between users and groups in which S in represents the likeliness user i will participate in group n . We use Flickr API to gather data about users, tags and groups. After stop-word removal and stemming, we end up with a size of 197 X 5328 X 4064 tensor and over 0.9 million nonzero entries. The ideal value of R should be large enough to capture all the important characterizations yet small enough to gain time efficiency. We range R from 10 to 100 by an interval of 10 and find that 50 is a experiments. Before performing group recommendati on, we first discuss if the proposed model could reasonably id entify the latent associations among users, tags and groups. We examine the decomposition results to present the leading entities in the 5 th mode shown in Table 1. As shown, all the tags and groups express the topic of component 5 to be self portrait , and the first column of way, our model can successfully di scover the latent associations among users, tags and groups.

Lee Bader antonkawasaki Steven Dempsey Nikki P. We use the top-k recommendations metric [6] to evaluate group recommendation results. That is, we suggest the top k groups for each user. We randomly select one joined group and k -1 unjoined groups for each user to form the test set and the remaining joined groups form the training set. We re peat this procedure 50 times for different random samplings. The objective is to find the place of the joined group in the recommendation list. There are k possible ranks for the joined group and the best result is that no unjoined groups appear before it. Figure 2 shows the cumulative distributions of ranks for the joined groups in the test set ( k =201). 0% means that the joined group is at the first pl ace in the ordered list, while 100% means that it turns up in the last position. To demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our model, we offer comparison tests on user-based model [7] a nd NMF-based model [8] on user-group matrix. Comparing the results, our model provides better group recommendations than user-based model and NMF-based model on our dataset. All these differences are statistically significant (p&lt;0.01). It may be because the proposed model could capture more latent and complex associ ations among user-tag-group than two-mode relations and provi de more reasonable results. In this paper, we provide a tens or decomposition-based Flickr group recommendation model by combining semantic data with social data. Preliminary experiments suppor t the validity and effectiveness of the approach. We plan to offer a deep analysis on the latent associations mined by such a mode l.
