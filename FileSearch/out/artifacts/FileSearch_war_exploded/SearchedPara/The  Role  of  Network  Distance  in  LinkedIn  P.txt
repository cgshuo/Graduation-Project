 LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network, with over 300 million members. One of the primary activities on the site is people search, for which LinkedIn members are both the users and the corpus. This paper presents insights about people search behavior on LinkedIn, based on a log analysis and a user study. In particular, it examines the role that network distance plays in name searches and non -name searches. For name searches, users primarily click on only one of the results, and closer network distance leads to higher click -through rates. In contrast, for non -name searches, users are more likely to click on multiple results that are not in their existing connections, but with whom they have shared connections. The results show that, while network distance contributes significantly to LinkedIn search engagement in general, its role varies dramatically depending on the type of search query.
 H.3.3 [ Infor mation Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  search process, selection process Algorithms, Experimentation, Human Factors Social network, exploratory search, people search People search is one of t he most popular types of online search. It is estimated that about 11% to 17% of web que ries contain a person X  X  name. [5 ] Therefore, understanding how people search for people is a critical issue in information retrieval.
 People search has been studied in several differ ent contexts. Weerkamp et al. [5 ] analyzed the query log of a people search engine on the web. They observed many differences between people search and web document search (e.g., higher percentage of one -query sessions and lower click -through rates). Also, Guy et al. [3] presented a study of the people search application (Faces) at IBM. They showed that the users behaved quite differently from the users who performed people search on the web. These results suggest that people searches vary bas ed on their contexts, and more studies are necessary to better understand and support various online people search.
 The online professional network is another context where people search is used extensively. For instance, LinkedIn, which has established it self as the largest pr ofessional network, has over 300 million members [7 ]. LinkedIn has reported that its members performed over 5.7 billion sea rches on the platform in 2012 [7 ]. The emergence of LinkedIn and other professional networks has given rise to a new class of search problems. Specifically, the graph structure of professional networks allows the users search for people with different network distances, which makes it essentially different from people search on the web or in an enterprise. The peo ple search systems in online social networks (e.g., LinkedIn and Facebook) mostly focus on supporting name search. At LinkedIn, there is a very long tail of search queries, and the largest cla ss of queries is name queries [8 ]. In addition, previous researc h [4] suggests it is dif fi cult to deliberately set out to discover speci fi c information from Facebook X  X  search and browsing features  X  especially in the case where one searches for an unknown person or expert. However, upon analysis of the search log of LinkedIn people sea rch, we found that when users enter certain type of queries (e.g., Job Title), their intentions and consequent actions are very different from those of name searches. This suggests that the type of search performed on LinkedIn is query dependent, and we ne ed to rethink how to better support these different types of search. The rest of this paper focuses on understanding the differences between how LinkedIn searchers behave in name searches and non-name searches . We first present a log analysis of LinkedIn people search that characterizes click behavior for different query tags . We find that there are significant differences between the click behaviors of name queries and non-name queries. Moreover, we find that network distance plays a key role in influenci ng click behavior, but that it a cts differently for name and non -name search es. We then present the results of a follow -up user study that we conducted to better understand the intentions motivating searchers to select a given search result . We conclude wi th the discussion of the design implications of our research for improving people search in the context of a professional network like LinkedIn. We analyzed the search logs of LinkedIn people searches conducted from 6/19/2013 to 7/18/2013. T he search log contains millions of unique people searches. We automatically tagged each query using a hidden Markov model that segmented the keywords and tagged each segment as an entity type (e.g., First Name and Company Name). For proprietary reasons, w e could not discuss the details of the tagger, but the internal human evaluation shows that our tagger has a precision of over 90%, and over 99% for identifying first and last names. We first analyzed the percentage of the searches that resulted in multi ple clicks when at least one click is performed based on their query tags (see Column 3 in Table 1). The results suggest that the sequence of tags describing a query was highly predictive of whether a search would result in single click or multiple clicks. Queries tagged as Job Title (e.g.,  X  X oftware engineer X ) were about 14 times more likely to have multiple clicks than queries tagged as First Name, Last Name. A Chi -squared test found that all the difference between the groups was significant with p &lt; 0.00 1. This suggests that we can use the query tags to infer the intent of the searchers. When users issue name queries (e.g., First Name, Last Name), they are more likely to be interested in a single target. Therefore, most of the times these searches result in only one click. On the other hand, when users issue non -name queries (e.g., Job Title and Skill), the users often want to explore the results and click on more than one result.
 To better understand the targets of the searches, we computed the aggregated click -through rate (CTR) over search results, broken down by the network distance between the search er and person in the search result . We found the patterns were very different for searches with different query tags. For name searches, 1 st -degree connect ions yield the highest CTR, and the CTR decreases as the network distance increased. In contrast, for non -name searches, the CTR for the results of 1 st -degree connections is comparatively much lower. For Title and Skill queries, the CTR for the results of 1 degree connections are the lowest. The CTR is maximal for 2 degree connections, and then drops for higher network distances  X  but is still higher than or at least similar to the CTR for direct connections. (see Columns 4, 5, and 6 in Table 1) The Chi -squared tests show that all the differences of the CTR on results with different network distances were statistically different (p &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that, while name searches often target people that are already in the searcher X  X  connection s, non -name search es usually prefer results that are not in the searcher X  X  existing connections. More specifically, non -name searches prefer 2 -degree results  X  that is, the people with whom the searcher shares connections . We further analyzed whether the users who search for people beyond their 1 st -degree connections connect with them after the searches. Our analysis found that the rate of building a new connection (an invitation to connect that is accepted) dropped when there were no shared connections b etween the user and their search results. This pattern is especially strong for non -name searches. The Chi-squared tests suggest that there are significant differences between the connect rates after clicks on 2 results and the connect rates after clicks on 3 rd -degree results (p &lt; 0.001). We found that users who issue non -name queries were much more likely to connect with the 2 nd -degree results they clicked on than those who issued name searches. But this pattern was reversed when there was no sha red connection: users who issued non -name queries were much less likely than those who issued name queries to connect to the 3 rd -degree (or more distant) results they clicked on.
 In summary, our log analysis shows that query tags are highly associated with the click behavior and connection rate for people search results with different network distances. For name searches, searchers often click on one result, and network distance negatively correlates to both CTR and connection rate. Users who search for non -name queries, however, are most interested in 2nd -degree connections, as evidenced by both CTR and connection rate. Our log analysis shows that the users who search for non -name queries behave much differently from users who search for name queries. Specifically, their click behaviors suggest they are performing exploratory search [6 ]. This means they are not searching for a specific target. Instead, they are exploring a set of people search results with desired characteristics. This is surpris ing because current people search systems focus on supporting name searches with specific targets. To gain more insight into how and why users conduct exploratory people search on LinkedIn, we conducted a user study. We surveyed 20 LinkedIn members who had performed non -name searches on LinkedIn. The participants were 60% male, and 65% were US-based. Their stated motives for using LinkedIn broke down as with different network distances (N ormalized by CTR on 1 click) ` follow s: 60% were recruiters looking for candidates, 25% were job seekers looking for new career opportun ities, and 15% of them were sales representatives or consultants looking for clients. We provided the participants with the following definition of an exploratory search:  X  X  earching for people with some set of characteristics, as opposed to searching for a specific person. X  We then asked them a set of questions that included the following: We also asked participants about the actions the y performed after finding people throug h search, as well as the general strategies they used to achieve their goals. The results of our log analysis suggest that in exploratory people search, users are more intereste d in the results that are not their direct connections. Our user study also supports this finding. Here are some excerpts from participant responses:  X  X f the person is someone I know, I can send them email directly and don X  X  need to use the search functio n at all. X  (P9, job seeker)  X  X he people in my first -degree connections are either the ones that are already working in my company or those who didn X  X  get [an] offer after the interview process, so I would not send invitations to them. X  (P2, recruiter)  X  I a m more interested in growing my n etwork and finding little gems who don't have many connections. It X  X  more likely they've not already been contacted by my competitors . X  (P6, sales) Explorato ry searchers target people that are not in their existing connect ions for two main reasons: These results suggest that exploratory people search on LinkedIn allows people to locate and connect to people that are not in their existing connections. These people can be more important for their career, and usually are hard to connect through earlier traditional methods (e.g., phone and email). Both our log analysis and our user study indicated that shared connections lead searcher s to make new connections after exploratory searches.
 The user study found two strategies that searchers employed in reaching out to 2 nd -degree connections.
 The first is to mention shared connections:  X  X  usually write something like:  X  X i, I saw you also know X. 
He worked with us as an intern last summer. X  This greatly increases the response rate. X  (P2, recruiter)  X  X ost of the time, people do not reply to people without shared connections, so I seldom try to contact people in my third degree connections. X  ( P11, job seeker) The second is to ask the shared connection for an introduction:  X  X hen I find the people in the company that I X  X  interested in, 
I will not contact them directly. I will first send a message to one of our common friends for introducing us.  X  (P1 2, job seeker)  X  X  feel like the most important thing for me to get a response from my target is whether my friend is willing to introduce us or not. X  (P13, job seeker) Searchers also said that common characteristics (e.g., education, previous employm ent) also increase the likelihood of a positive response:  X  X  would say the response rate for ordinary recru iters is just around 20%. For alumni , the response rate will increase to about 50% X  (P16, job seeker)  X  X hen I try to connect to someone, I will writ e in the message that says: it X  X  weird that we haven X  X  met since we have so much in common. Let X  X  connect! X  (P1 9, recruiter) In sum, even though exploratory search users target people that are not in their existing connections, they still rely on the shar ed connections and other common characteristics to build up trust between each other. Hence, they place the highest value on 2 degree connections. Our results have several design implications for people search in online professional network s. First, t he ranking function in the pe ople search system  X  and perhaps the overall search experience  X  should adjust based on the query type. Our analysis suggests that users who perform non -name searches prefer results that are not in their 1 connections, which is the opposite of what we see for name searches. The search engine should assign a lower rank to 1 degree connections for non -name searches . Since we also found that the query tagger can be very accurate , we advocate an approach where the search engine adjusts the ranking model and interface when it detects a different search intent. In addition , the search interface should clearly show how the 2 degree connections are related to the users. Since people use shared connections and cha racteristics to build new connections, providing this information when the users explore the results can help them decide which results are most useful. The current LinkedIn interface shows users thei r number of shared connections. This abstract number, ho wever, may not be detailed enough for detailed exploration. Figure 1 shows an alternative interface (based on a visualization from the LinkedIn profile page) that presents more information about the common traits between users.
 Moreover , our study also pro vides implications for social networking research. In Granovetter X  X  seminal work on the strength of weak ties [2 ], he showed that in face -to-face environments people use their weak ties to connect to 2 connections. These weak ties, which serve as bridges between strongly connected groups, created the most opportunities for social mobility. While more work is necessary to study the parallels of Granovetter X  X  findings in online spaces, to date, our findings confirm Granovetter X  X  work that people sear ch various opportunities through their 2 nd -degree connections. Professional online networks such as LinkedIn are changing the job search and recruit landscape. Unlike in face -to-face job interaction, they enable members to explicitly identify and access t heir 2 connections without direct help from weak ties. Perhaps it is time to create new tie theories for a world where people have richer access to their extended professional networks.
 Finally, the system should help the users to evaluate their c hances to get positive response by calculating the strength of the path to the indirect ties. Previous research has shown that the strength of direct ties [1] can be accurately predicted. H owever, calculating the strength of indirect ties is more complicated than the strength of direct ties. It involves at least three main aspects: Understanding how these three aspects contribute to the strength of indirect ties allows us to find the best candidates and the optimal path that c an reach to them. This also lets us reexamine the weak tie hypothesis to see whether weak or strong ties can be better bridges to reach out to their targets. We found two key contributions in our study of people search on LinkedIn. First, Our study suggests that search intention can be detected using auto matic query tagging. We found that users who perform non -name searches on LinkedIn target their 2 connections because they are unexplored, but still have the shared connections increas e their chances of mak ing a new connection. This is significantly different from th e user behavior of search ers who issue name queries , where both CTR and connection rates drop as the network distance increases. In addition, our study shows that LinkedIn people search allows searchers to engage their 2 nd -degree connections directly. How could the system better support the interactions between the people who don X  X  know each other in the real world? And how does this change the way people seek new career opp ortunities? These questions represent opportunities for subsequent research, and are compelling research directions in the areas of online social and professional networking.
