 In a multi -step assessment of a corporate social media platform, which has been implemented in a large company for internal collaboration, we identified three major challenges regarding acceptance and adoption of the platform: (1) diverging perspectives &amp; uncertain top -down communication, (2) functionality jungle &amp; high usage complexity , and (3) lacking collaboration &amp; customization . Based on these challenges, we discuss potential implications for design and implementation of corporate social media . The challenges and implications were derived from data gathered in two rounds of polling employees of the company, where we found that the surveyed employees tended to initially accept the internally implemented so cial media platform. Nevertheless, by assessing their attitude one and a half years later, we came to understand that the employees have rarely adopted the platform into their daily work practices. This finding led us to analyze in detail the qualitative d ata gathered along with the survey, as it holds valuable examples and explanations to better understand this phenomenon. Besides presenting the results of the surveys, t his paper focuses on the discussion of challenges and implications for enhancing collab oration and support ing adoption processes of social media in workplaces. H.5.3 [Group and Organization Interfaces]: Collaborative computing and Computer -supported cooperative work Human Factors. Corporate Social Media ; CSCW; Cooperative System Evaluation; Collaboration . Social media not only pervade our private lives, but also change the landscape of corporate technologies (e.g., [19], [41]). On one hand, they enter work through the use of private social media during work hours. On the other hand, corporations themselves acknowledge the potential of functions and features in social media and increasingly use them for external communication (e.g., Facebook pages) as well as internal collaboration. However, the process of implementing social media for internal collaboration into corporations is complex. It is challenging to decide for a tool, to roll it out, and actually use it, especially for a longer period of time. In our work we focus on researching social media as tools for interna l collaboration, i.e., dedicated tools to facilitate internal networking and innovation processes. Thereby, we are specifically interested in the social of corporate social media (i.e., how it contribute s to and constitute s collaboration through the usage of social media ). We had the opportunity to not only accompany the introduction of such a social media tool in a large corporation (approximately 26.000 employees), but also to observe its usage repeatedly within a period of two years. Our role, as researc hers, was to investigate the social media usage throughout the implementation process. We investigated the employees X  experiences at the end of the pilot -phase by means of a questionnaire. One and a half year s later, we again distributed the questionnaire to the employees, this time including a set of open questions to focus on further facets that we found to be relevant in the previous studies. Even though the platform was one and a half years in the field between the first and the second poll, the findin gs surprisingly showed that the corporate social media platform did not increase in popularity within this timeframe, as it was rated slightly worse, (e.g., in terms of internal collaboration potential of the corporate social media ). This indicates that the employees rarely integrate d the social media platform into their daily work practices, i.e., the platform was not entirely adopt ed. In order to explore the reasons, we looked at the qualitative data in detail  X  and found that the employees acknowledged the potential of the platform, but did not know how to actually make use of that potential. In this paper, we start by giving an overview of literature related to corporate social media in the fiel d of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) in which our work is positioned . Then , we outline our research objectives and briefly present the quantitative outcomes of our questionnaires that illustrate the acceptance and (non)adoption processes of th e social media platform. Afterwards, we discuss those findings on basis of the qualitative results. Finally, we derive challenges and implications for the design and implementation of social media for company internal collaboration, which constitut e the ma in contribution of this paper. The technology that is used for company internal collaboration is, in literature, either labeled enterprise social media (e.g., [34], [35]), or enterprise social networks/network sites (e.g., [13], [26], [42]). However, those terms are not selectively used. In this paper we decided to use the term corporate s ocial media, emphasizing that we are referring to any technology that facilitates social interactions, such as collaboration and networking within an enterprise . In academic research, very valuable and influential work has been done at IBM (e.g., [34]), wherein their internal corporate social media platform was investigated . This example shows  X  X arly adopters X  of social media in large enterprises, therefore represen ting a valuable source for our research. We add to this research by investigating social media in a company , wherein social media are considered exclusively a tool for internal collaboration and potentially innovation , from the implementation phase of the platform onwards , as we regard longitudinal studies as providing a great potential to investigate organizational behavior and it s dynamics in greater detail . Besides academic research , there is also related work in the area of business consulting, which focuses, for instance, on success factors of enterprise social networks (ESN) [26]. However, there are hard ly scientific research findings that combine academic and industrial perspectives on social media integration in a long -term study . One of the few exceptions is the work from Arch ambault and Grudin [1], who conducted a longitudinal study of Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter use with employees working at Microsoft, aiming to investigat e attitudes and behaviors around social networking sites and communication technologi es in general, through carrying out four in -depth surveys. Also Holtzblatt et al. [16] discuss the benefits of multi -step investigations to study and evaluate indiv iduals X  social media usage patterns . They conducted a long -term study at MITRE and its social business platform called Handshake . Tierney and Drury [43] likewise investigated improvement potentials regarding the innovation management through social media in the case of MITRE. However, Handshake was not only designed to enable employees , but a lso trusted external partners to improve social ties and create their own profiles, rather than a tool that is exclusively meant for company internal collaboration purposes. In the following, we give a brief overview of what social media are in general. A fterwards, we illustrate related work on corporate social media (including Intranet, which we consider being a pre -form of corporate social media) and social network sites followed by related research on acceptance, adoption and appropriation. In brief, social m edia may be defined as  X  X he media we use to be social. X  ( [41], p . 3). However, this very broad definition m ay not particularly address and uncover all aspects that are related to social media, such as content sharing sites, blogs, social networking, and wikis, in order to actually create, find, share, modify, discuss, and make sense of the mass of information available online ([15], [19]) . Boyd and Ellison ( [1], p. 211), for example, define social m edia  X  X s web -based services that allow individuals to (1) construct a public or semi -public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those by others within a system. X  This definition lays an emphasis on social networking, in terms of enabling users to articulate but also make their social networks visible. In c ontrast to this definition, Kaplan and Haenlein ( [18]) rather refer to the notion that social media provides the capability to create and exc hange User Generated C ontent (U GC). I n their view  X  X ocial Media is a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technologi cal foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of User Generated Content. X  ([18], p. 61) . Social m edia have recently begun to pervade corporations to, for instance, lightweight internal , and maybe also support informal communication and collaborat ion among employees . Contrary to traditional corporate communication media such as email, social media allow employees  X  X o circumvent traditional organizational hierarchies and to connect with geographically distant readers. X  ([5], p. 61) Before the initiation of s ocial m edia, corporations already used computer -based tools for these purposes, such as Intranets (e.g., [27], [29]). Lai [27] found in a survey with 500 organizations in Hong Kong that organizations with a greater ex tent of I ntranet -based collaborations had significantly better employee and organizational performance. The author concluded that collaboration is rather n ot about the technology, but about how it is used to increase the employees X  performance. Therefore, positive input from the employees is needed, as well as a good fit between task and technology.
 Even though Intranet mig ht be considered a pre -form of soci al media, the terminology, and connected to that, the notion has changed . Referring to the terminology of social media, companies express their emphasis on pursuing something social , something that has not been in the focus when using earlier collab oration tools. In reference to social m edia literature that is in line with our understanding ,  X  social X  refers to humans X  instinctual needs to connect with other humans (e.g., [40], [41]) and address es basic needs to be around and included in groups of like -minded individuals in order to feel at home and comfortable in sharing thoughts, experiences, and ideas. The second part of the terminology ,  X  X edia X , refers to the actual medi um used in order to make those connections with other individual s [41]. Consequently, social m edia incorporate several aspects (or building blocks), such as presence, sharing, conversations, groups, identity, relationships, and reputation [19].
 Social m edia are thus not only an instrument with specific features and functions, but al so express the focus on the sociality of employees being an integral part of collaboration. For instance, Kaplan and Haenlein [18] reviewed social m edia for business purposes and stated regarding collaborative projects that  X  X he main idea underlying collabor ative projects is that the joint effort of many actors leads to a better outcome than any actor could achieve individually. X  ([18], p. 62) In terms of social structures in enterprises,  X  the use of social and open technologies, like a wiki at the workplace, represents a dynamic social production of new structures and repr oduction or reflection of existing structures . X  ([30], p. 14) Consequently, the use of social media is governed by both emergent and reflected social structures [30]. Also , the remote participation in geographically distributed work through social media has been researched , revealing that even if people work alone, the distri buted work is actually very social [22]. Muller et al. [34] investigate d 188 very active online communities at IBM. They found that different types of communities differed in their appropriation of social media tools to create and use shared resources and build relationships within these networks. They concluded , for instance , that different types of communities with a different number of community members seem to require different extents of efforts from their leaders. DiMicco et al. [8] interviewed people at IBM regarding their social media usage and found that personal profiles hav e a crucial role. They argue that profiles need to be dynamic, changing according to a user  X  X  activity elsewhere on the site (e.g., when writing a comm ent or creating content) and they need to be customizable, allowing the user to choose which information to display where on the page. Geyer et al. [13] have conducted a study at IBM with 2 .000 users regarding a recommender system for profiles, which  X  X ecommends X  content for users to create, rather than consume. Further r esearch in this area has shown that online profiles are very important when it comes to the for mation of personality impressions and that users also intentionally craft their profiles to convey a desired impression (e.g., [11]). In order to create a social media experience, profiles are thus an essential feature. Furthermore, Thom et al. [42] investigated the effect of rewards and gamification on users X  activity and found that removing gamification features from their social network led to a negative impact on users X  activities on the site. Based on six case studies in small and medium sized enterprises, Zeiller and Schauer [46] emphasized the necessity of additional activities (e.g., training sessions for inexperienced employees) to have satis factory user acceptance rates. The above-mentioned aspects found in related work may contribute to the employees X  acceptance, adoption and appropriation of corporate social media. Generally spoken, acceptance is an attitude towards technology, which is influenced by a variety of factors (s ee e.g., [7], [38], [39], [44]). Technology adoption is a process that ends with a user embracing a technology, making full use of it [39]. Appropriation, i.e., individuals using technology in their own ways, indicates that users understand and are comfortable with the technology [9]. It is an active process of incorporation and co -evolution of technologies, practices and settings [10], such as influences of cultural processes or negotiations between social practices and technological features [2]. Analyzing acceptance as well as adopt ion and appropriation processes of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has become a common agenda for practitioners as well as researchers in the field of information studies [24]. However, there are still challenges the field faces in understanding and designing for these processes [33]. Furthermore, the concepts are not strictly distinct to one another. In this paper, we thus investigate acceptance, meaning the employees X  attitude towards the corporate media at a specific point in time, as well as adoption, which we consider the process of actually integrating th e social m edia into daily work practices. In reference to Dix [9], we are not focusing on technology appropriation, as we need to understand the employees X  acceptance and adoption before looking specifically at the employees X  own ways of using corporate social media. With our research, we aim to better understand what the social aspect of social media in enterprises is, i.e., how it contribute s to and constitute s collaboration through the usage of social media. Hence, o ur research focuses on  X  investigating social aspects that contribute to collaboration  X  identifying collaborative capabilities of corporate social  X  increasing the acceptance of th e corporate social media  X  facilitating adoption processes of corporate social media We had the opportunity to cooperate with a large enterprise where we could actually study and investigate the collaborative capabilities of corporate social media. We conducted several quantitative, but also qualitative driven research activities, which are presented in the following. Our industrial partner is a leading system solutions manufacturer for the automotive and industrial electronics sector. The company employs about 26.000 people in locations throughout the USA, Europe, and the Asia -Pacific region , focusing on the development of new and innovative products for the market. Therefore , they considered corporate social media being appropriate to make use of the employees X  communication and collaboration potential in order to support innovation processes within and across the different departments and sites. Regarding our different research activities , we mainly cooperated with the innovation mana gement of the company and frequently organized knowledge -exchange sessions with their respective representatives. To make use of the employees  X  collaboration potential, they particularly aim to (1) organize all sites within the company, (2) establish infor mation and knowledge exchange across multiple sites, (3) support the formation of online communities, and (4) enable the employees to search (e.g., colleagues, communities, documents) for what they need within their specific working area. They decided to use Microsoft SharePoint 2010, which is a web application platform. Usually, SharePoint is strongly associated with document systems and web content, but it actually offers a broad platform of web technologies to suit a high variety of solutions. It provid es a multi -purpose design, which allows the management, scaling, but also provisioning of business applications. Additionally, SharePoint provides pre -defined  X  X pplications X  for commonly requested functionalities (e.g., file and document management, collaboration spaces, social tools) Based on these pre -defined  X  X pplications X  , our industrial partner had selected a high variety of different features and functionalities (e.g., newsfeed and expertise browser) in order to achieve the four above-mentioned aims. In order to provide an overview of our research activities, the following section describes the different steps, including methods and instruments used. The pilot -phase of the platform (i.e., the release of the platform for selected users, such as community members and volunteers from selected departments) lasted from April 2011 until June 2012. Therein, we accompanied the initial release , for example, by means of heuristic expert evaluations and the definition of use cases (step 1). Afterwards, we evaluated the pilot -phase with a first questionnaire round (step 2). The final rollout (to all employees of the company) was also evaluated with an extended version of the questionnaire (step 3) in June 2013. Within the pilot -phase, we defined objectives and goals for our research activities, which was done in close collaboration with our partner to shape and support the introduction of the social media. Therefore, several methodological approaches had been applied: (1) knowledge -exchange workshops together with representatives of our industrial partner to raise awareness, (2) a success criteria survey in order to define aspects characterizing a successful implementation of corporate social media, (3 ) an heuristic expert evaluation to identify major usability issues, and (4) the definition of use -cases together with our industrial partner to shape the intended interaction with the platform. More detailed descriptions about the approach and related results can be found in previous publications (see [20] and [21]). Based on the findings from step 1, a questionnaire had been developed in order to assess the initial perception of the social media platform [20]. In addition to the gathered findings in step 1, we conducted knowledge -exchange sessions together with 20 community managers at two different sites of our industrial partner in order to discuss the most important themes regarding their corp orate social media. The questionnaire: Based on the findings from step 1, we developed items for evaluating corporate social media, resulting in 17 items. They covered aspects of expectations towards the usage of social media in terms of hopes and wishes for the implementation, barriers the employees see when introducing social media for collaboration as well as potentials and capabilities for the use of the platform in the future. The items were measured on four -point Likert scales (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = agree, 4 = strongly agree) with an additional option to indicate  X  X on X  X  know X , which was excluded from further calculations (due to limitations to indicate an agreement on a certain statement at present) . In total, around 2.000 selected employees (e.g., community managers und selected users mainly from departments in Munich and Villach ) were part of the pilot-phase and thereby invited to complete the first run of the questionnaire. This represents the whole population of pilot -phase participants a t this time as only selected departments of our cooperation partner were involved in the test-phase of the platform . The questionnaire was distributed for 10 days via an online survey tool that was internally provid ed by our industrial partner. Based on inclusion criteria (e.g., having experience with the platform), 224 filled in questionnaires (11,2%) could finally be used for the analysis . In January 2013, the social media plat form was rolled out to the entire company. Since then, it was intended for employees around the globe to use the platform within their daily work in order to collaborate and communicate within and across the different departments and sites. We decided to r eassess the employees X  attitude towards the platform by distributing the questionnaire (in an extended version) for a second time.
 The modified questionnaire: In addition to the 17 items that we developed for the questionnaire, we included further items i nto the questionnaire to be assessed in the second round. As the acceptance of the platform was rather neutral in the first round (stated in more detail in the next section), we wanted to extend the questionnaire to better understand influences on this phe nomenon. In literature, we identified trust as a potential complementing factor on acceptance and the actual intention to use a system [3]. Consequently , we included trust related aspects in the second deployment by following McKnight and Harrison X  X  [32] approach, as they distinguish between trust in people (interpersonal trust) and trust in technology (system trust). Various questionnaires have been developed to measure interpersonal and system trust (e.g., [17], [31], [32], [34]), whereof we extracted 6 items considered as the most relevant items for our questionnaire (e .g., helpfulness, functionality, integrity). We also included six items related to the innovation potential of the platform in terms of how the social media platform supports or strengthens the generation of innovations, as this was one of the main purpose s of introducing the social media platform. Besides the quantitative items, the questionnaire also held an additional set of three qualitative, open -ended questions. This time they aimed to explore underlying reasons and opinions as well as further facets of collaboration that were found to be of relevance in the first round. Two of the se questions addressed the employees X  collaboration needs in terms of most important functions on the platform , first regarding the already available functions, and second, f urther required functions for the future . The third question focused on the social media X  X  potential to foster innovation, explicitly asking for the employees X  estimations about what the innovation management might expect from the usage of social media in order to identify innovation capabilities on the platform that foster innovation. For the innovation managements X  general prospects see section 4.
 The deployment of the questionnaire lasted for two weeks and was sent via email to a random sample of 2 .300 community members on the platform from departments around the globe . As it was not distributed to the same sample (i.e., pilot -phase users in the first round and actual end -users within the se cond round) , a within -subject comparison between the first and s econd round was not possible. In order to increase the response rate, a remind er was sent out after one week. Overall, we received 303 questionnaires, whereby based on pre -defined exclusion criteria (e.g., having no experience with the usage of the platfor m), 144 responses (6,3%) were finally taken into consideration for further quantitative and qualitative analysis . In this section, we first give an overview of the results gathered throughout our quantitative analysis to illustrate how the employee s assessed and valued the platform within the first and second round. The quantitative results revealed that the employ ees have rarely adopted the corporate social media into their daily work practices (see section 6.1). Therefore, we present our qualitati ve explorations gathered along with the quantitative data in more detail, in order to investigate underlying reasons and opinions (see section 6.2). In a subsequent section (see section 7), we discuss and reflect upon these findings by means of derived challenges and general implications for the design and implementation of corporate social media . As the sample differed for the two measurements (i.e., pilot -phase users in the first round and actual end -users within the se cond round), independent sample t -tests were conducted. Thereby, we aimed to assess how the employees accepted the social media platform at the two instances in time to find out whether they adopted the social media platform into their daily work practices (see Table 1) . All items from the second point of measurement were rated slightly worse than in the first round, whereof eight differences in the scores for single items between the first and the second round were statistically significant. Three relate to exp ectations, two to barriers and the final three to potentials of the platform. This means that the employees X  expectations regarding the usage of the platform and the identified potentials for using corporate social media in the future were significantly co nsidered worse within the second round. Table 1 provides an overview of selected items, which illustrate the tendency that the social media platform has not really become part of the employees X  daily work. As an example, the item  X  X he social media platform simplifies day -to-day business  X  was rated significantly worse in the second questionnaire round than in the first one . Even though not different by statistical significance on a 5 % significance level, by tendency the employees seemed to less expect that the platform simplifies internal collaboration in the second round than in the first round, where we found this aspect having the third most positive rating.
 Thus, when reassessing the employees X  attitude in the second round, the employees were not as sur e about the internal collaboration potential of corporate social media any more.
 In addition to the statistically significant differences, we also came to understand throughout the quantitative analysis that, within both rounds, the employees agreed with the item  X  X  update my profile infrequently. X  Still, personal profiles would play a crucial role for corporate social media to be successful [7], as humans have the fundamental need to belong and connect to others [40]. Thus, we will come back to this aspect within the discussion section (see section 7). Even though the employees X  attitude towards the inherent expectations, barriers and potentials were dec idedly rated worse within the second round, it has to be noted that the mean values for both rounds are mostly located around the middle . This means that the employees X  opinions were on average rather neutral than specifically positive or negative at both instances indicating that the employees have not completely rejected the social media platform, but they were also not really convinced that it would benefit their internal collaboration. Complementary to these results , we now want to outline the findings gathered with the additional six quantitative items on interpersonal and system trust, that were part of the second deployment , as trust might be a comple menting factor to acceptance and adoption and therefore might enrich a deeper understanding of these processes [3]. The mean value (M=2,78) of the trust construct suggests that employees tend to trust in the platform as well as in the present communities and their community members. This slight positive tendency can be supported through r esearch in this area as  X  X n enterprise provides a shared context in addition to the context of the community, which can contribute to a level of trust and common ground X  ([34], p. 2815). On basis of the single items, the highest agreement rate was found for the item  X  X he social media platform is trustworthy X  (M = 2,95 ). This is important , as a low level of trust in a system constitutes a tremendous barrier to actually use a system or even use a sy stem for the first time [38]. As the employees tend ed to trust the platform but also the individuals on the platform, the rather rare adoption of the corporate social media might not be explained by a lack of trust building strategies. The gathered results wi thin the first round showed that the employees, taking part in the pilot -phase, at that time had rather accepted the newly implemented corporate social media platform, or at least not rejected it. However, the second deployment of the questionnaire after the final rollout (i.e., one and a half year s later) revealed that the employees had rarely adopted the corporate social media into their daily work practices. Hence, we wondered what had happened since we first evaluated the platform. In order to identify the underlying reasons, we analyzed the qualitative data gathered along with the questionnaire, by means of con tent analyse s [23] (i.e., the data was condensed and categorized according to its relevance for our research goal). We followed an explorative, open categorization approach, meaning that we did not strive for generalizable results, but aimed to identify motivations and challenges regardin g the adoption of t he platform. In the following, we outline our qualitative findings in more detail, starting with the description of the results gathered with the first two qualitative questions on employees  X  collaboration needs regarding the corporate social media (sectio n 6.2.1). Subsequent ly, we present the qualitative results from the third open question on innovation capabilities on the platform to foster innovation (section 6.2.2).

SD 1 The social media platform simplifies day -to-day 2 The social media platform promotes 3 I X  X  confident about using the social media 4 The social media platform simplifies internal 5 I update my profile infrequently. 3.27 0.84 3.22 0.83 0.05 0.65 .517 Even though specifically asked for the most important functions on the platform, the employees also made use of this question to express their general attitudes and opinions towards the platform. They expressed their wishes and needs from a more generic perspective to highlight what they consider as crucial for corporate social media and, therefore, what they find important to actually use the platform within their day -to-day business.
 Mo st relevant f unctions on the platform: The majority of the statements concern  X  X haring/exchange X , capturing general aspects that were mentioned by the employees. The employees consider ed the possibility to share and exchan ge information as the most important function on the platform and, therefore, that collaboration on various levels and topics is the most important capability of corporate social media. They expressed their wish to collaborate within and across sites and within and across communiti es and colleagues, including unknown people. As many employees used this question to express their general attitude towards the platform, we believe that even though sharing and exchanging information is intended and already supported by a high variety of different functionalities on the platform, open issues still exist to fulfill the users X  collaboration needs.
 Throughout knowledge -exchange sessions with representatives from the innovation management, we came to understand that it might be less an issue of availability of specific functions, but rather how they are actually used and introduced to the employees . Until then, no specific introductory trainings or strategies have been comprehensively applied to make the employees familiar with the platform . Additionally, t he large number of pre -defined  X  X pplications X  provided by SharePoint seem ed to have made it difficult to choose from, without any pre -selection according to the employees  X  needs. Maybe also more information for the employees might have been b eneficial on which functions to use for which collaboration purpose, and what added value the usage of the platform generates for day -to-day business. Similarly, one employee stated,  X  X n the past two years I did not find a good use for the social media pla tform  X  (original quote). This impression can also be supported through our quantitative findings, as the employees , who were part of the second round, less expected that the usage of corporate social media promote d communication than in the first round (se e T able 1).
 Additional functions to be included in the future: These findings align with the answers regarding additional functions the employees want ed to have on the platform in the future , which are outlined in more detail in the following . The employees X  responses mainly either address ed both high quality and additional content on the platform, or a better overview of already existing content by reducing the platform X  X  complexity. The employees want ed to share and exchange information on the pla tform; however, regarding the design (e.g., complexity) of the platform they were not completely satisfied. As outlined before, the high variety of different functionalities available on SharePoint led to a rather high usage complexity. The majority of ad ditional functions mentioned by the employees aim ed at reducing this high complexity and, therefore, provide d a better overview of the platform (e.g., receive emails in case of updates on the platform). Consequently, the employees require a simpler usage o f the social media platform . This goes in line with the quantitative finding that employees, who were part of the second round, found the platform less simplifying their day -to-day business, than the ones polled in the first round (see T able 1). In addition, the employees also explicitly outlined the need for a consistent interface design and representation of content, a better navigation through all pages, and a general advancement of the platform X  X  usability. The employees also emphasized the request for an appropriate extent of content and, in particular, high -quality content on the platform. The employees stated a particular need to increase the quality of the content within the different online communities, but also within discussions about problems th ey sought a solution for (e.g., discussions within online communities, but also within the  X  X uestion -answer X  function). With regard to the extent of content provided on the platform, the employees want ed additional information about colleagues, their respe ctive working areas, the different sites and new technologies. In order to actually collaborate with each other, this information was considered a prerequisite. The aspect of extensive information about colleagues and working areas might also be related t o the results regarding personal profile pages of the employees. As identified with the questionnaire, the employees did not regularly update their profiles. Still, they highlighted the importance of the personal profile pages within the qualitative part. In particular, they outlined that profile pictures and short pieces of information would be very helpful. Some employees mentioned that they occasionally looked at profile pictures to be able to identify colleagues when meeting them face -to-face (e.g., in a meeting with colleagues, whom they have not physically met before). Also the possibility to gather more information about the competencies of colleagues , as well as the details and content provided on the profile pages of how to contact someone , were considered as very useful . To further investigate the innovation potential of the platform we included a respective open question. This question targeted to investigate the employees X  perspectives and attitudes towards various innovation activities on the platform (e.g., specific innovation online communities or voting X  X  on the platform to award innovative ideas ). For the innovation managements X  general prospects see section 4. Overall, we identified three main aspects w ithin the gathered data. The employees believe d that the innovation management expects (1) better, faster and easier communication through the usage of the platform; (2) advancing networking capabilities through the platform; and (3) that ideas on certain topics and issues are shared and exchanged on the platform. Based on this overall perspective, communication seem ed to be the basis for networking, idea generation and innovations, as the employees be lieve d that the innovation m anagement expect ed to establ ish networks through and across employees, sites , and communities. By building stronger networks via the platform, the innovation management intend ed to ease the discussion on complex topics and reduce time needed for generating innovations.
 They also beli eved that the innovation management expect ed to advance the way ideas are shared and exchanged by using the social media platform. Networking might be considered a precondition for sharing and exchanging ideas , both needed for a successful use of corporate social media to support the generation of and discussion about innovations. The employees emphasized the following potentials of the social media platform to facilitate innovation: (1) involving different people with different backgrounds, (2) involving n ot just experts in discussions, but also novices, (3) using the platform to be faster and more spontaneous, and (4) also sharing thoughts and not just elaborated ideas. These answers reveal that the platform support ed innovation processes that are less com plex, hierarchical, time consuming, and more open as it was previously within their company. One employee emphasized that the innovation management might expect an  X  X mproved cross -functional networking to get a higher level of communication within the org [sic] and to avoid re -creating the wheel. To improve and speed up innovation, brainstorming and creating networks. X  (original quote) Figure 1 provides a visualization of the above presented findings and their mapping to the challenges, which we derived. However, as visualized in the figure , the mappings are not completely distinct , as some findings may be interpreted in several ways . In the following, we summarize the results and reflect upon the challenge that is inhe rent to these findings linking them to related work . After each identified challenge, we describe the general implications for co rpo rate social media, derived from the se results and challenges. By tendency, the results from the second round suggest that the employees less expect ed that the platform simplifies internal collaboration, compared to the first round (see section 6.1). Furthermore, even though the employees consider ed the sharing/exchangin g of information, and hence collaboration on various levels and topics as the most important capability of corporate social media, the users X  collaboration needs (e.g., on basis of the provided functionalities) were not fulfilled yet (see 6.2.1) . A high va riety of different collaboration functions were already available on the platform as intended by the innovation management (see section 6.2.2) . Nevertheless, the employees might not have been appropriately introduced to how to use them and in particular what for (see section 6.2.1). These findings lead us to discuss the (mis -) match betwee n the employees and the (innovation) management, including uncertain top -down communication channels , which will be outlined in more de tail in the following.
 While the intended purpose of the corporate social media platform was to support collaboration, the employees X  actual usage did not match this intention. Furthermore, the top -down targets of how to use the corporate social media plat form (and what for) were either not articulated clearly enough or employees simply did not completely comply with those. Here, a problematic situation evolves. On the one hand, hierarchical top -down structures are needed to give instructions on how to use the corporate social media platform to start its integration into daily work (to  X  X et it going X ). On the other hand, hierarchical structures might counteract using the platform, as many activities can be easily monitored by the management via the corporate social media platform, which might make employees be skeptical about its usage. This impression can be supported through other research in this area. For instance, Orlikowski [36] highlight ed that if the underlying premises of social media (e.g., shared effort, cooperation, collaboration) are counter -cultural to the structural properties of an organization (e.g., rigid hierarchy) the technology is unlikely to be u sed collectively. Majumdar et al. [28] considered issues such as privacy and security, and the awareness of being watched by the organization, as major concerns of users when using corporate social media. Furthermore, Orlikowski and Gash [37] derived three core domains of individuals X  technological frames ; i.e., different interpretations of technological artifacts by multiple user groups . The three frame domains embody understand ings that reflect what the technology is (nature of technology), why it was introduced (technology strategy), and how it is used to create various changes in work (technology in use).
 Here, similar to our findings, they found out that expectations (and actions ) about a technology between different user groups (e.g., technologists and managers) are distinct due to diverging technolog ical frames. They emphasize d the need to identify the means through which technology frames become shared or divergent . For example, it may be useful to examine how much difference in assumptions, knowledge, and expectations about technology constitute frame incongruence, and if the notion about incongruence varies by context and time [37].
 Furthermore, Faste et al. [12] emphasize d that communities need to be open and accessible for all employees to increase the innovation potential and, therefore, the collaboration on the platform. However, this process requires the company not only to commit itself to openness on the platform, but also within offline collaboration to avoid being perceived ambiguously by the employees and, thus, not be ing taken seriously.
 Implication : Articulate top -down intentions and requirements clearly a nd address potential fears of employees regarding the usage of the corporate social media. Here, it is particularly important to understand the employees X  perspectives (e.g., fears), as the perceived benefits of corporate social media are motivated at a  X  X  ersonal level X  [28]. Be honest in what the management will monitor and what they expect from the employees . Follow a consequent strategy that holds true for online and offline collaboration. Promote co -design approaches to actively involve employees from all hierarchical levels to be part of an open, creative , interpretative and social process that facilitates social interaction and hence co -experience. Furthermore, support the engagement with the social media platform also in uncommon ways to make the employees curious, (e.g., through gamified, ludic approaches ). A certain degree of curiosity and interest might be needed to start engaging with the platform at all. Thom et al. [42], for instance, described gamified elements as supporting the usage of a corporate social network site. The high varieties of pre -defined  X  X pplications  X  provided by SharePoint (see section 4) were not optimally chosen according to the employees collaboration needs . The cluttered interface, b y this time , made most of the collaborative capabiliti es of the platform accessible for all employees . Therefore , the employees explicitly outline d their desire for a better overview and structuring of available tools and content as they saw the inherent need to reduce the platform X  X  usage complexity , e.g., receive emails in case of updates on the platform (see section 6.2.1). This impression can be supported by the finding that the employees consider ed the social media platform as less simplifying their day -to-day business (in terms of collaborative tasks) as in the first point of measurement (see section 6.1). Hence, our second identified challenge deals with the high availability of collaboration supporting functions resulting in a high usage complexity of the corporate social media platform . The multitude of functions on the platform overwhelmed the employees, resulting in a kind of cluelessness on which functions to use for which purposes . In relation to thi s aspect , Muller et al. [34] address communities X  appropriation and use practices of corporate technologies and developed implications for the fit of community goals and needed functions (e.g., community recommendation service, templates for differ ent types of communities). Furthermore, our results showed that the social media platform require d efforts from the employees to learn and effectively use the platform for internal collaboration, requiring time and help. Some surveyed employees, for instance, claimed to improve search functions according to the Intranet they were used to .  X  X oogling in the old Intranet gave better results. X  (original quote) . Not only does this refer to the need for adequate outcomes and benefits of using the corporate social media platform, but also for relying on activities and strategies , which the employees were already familiar with in order to decrease barriers and rejections. Regarding search engines , Grudin [14] emphasizes that people use search engines to find answers to questions more efficiently than they can by directly searching the pertinent online document that actually contains the answers. He outlines that the reason why Google was so effective is that searching worked out well even when using non -expert terminology. Implication : Guide the online communities on what functions to use for what purpose by, for example, reducing the number of choices in the beginning to ease the start for the communities and step -by-step releasing of functions (e. g., in terms of a social media  X  X tarter -set  X  to make the employees familiar with the platform and hence reduce initial usage b arriers) . Furthermore, allow the employees to dedicate time for getting familiar with the platform (instead of just being an add -on activity) and provide them with help, for instance, through trainings or trained colleagues. Finally, create familiarity, such as relying on conventions known from previously used Intranets or else. As outlined before (see section 6.2.1) , the employees indicate d the need to share and exchange information and knowledge across communities an d sites. This aspect implies also the need to have appropriate information and access to information about colleagues, working areas and sites to establish a basis for corporate collaboration (see section 6.2.1). The employees want ed to involve different people with different backgrounds . They did not only require experts , but also novices for sharing thoughts . Additionally, less elaborated ide as may also be part of these discussions, allowing faster and much more spontaneous collaborations . This would advance currently common collaboration practices in order to make use of the innovation capabilities of corporate social media (see section 6.2.2). However, counterproductive to these needs, the employees did not regularly update their profile s (see section 6.1), which made it hard to network internally. Based on these findings, our third derived challenge focuses on lacking collaboration an d customization. Even though the employees were seeking for comprehensive company internal collaboration , the provided resources (e.g., functions) for this purpose were not used . This might be due to several reasons such as limited access to content (e.g., through not having a computer available continuously), lacking quality of the content (e.g., W ho makes sure that the shared content is correct and complies with the companies regulations? What is high quality content?), or rarely updated profiles, which would be needed to benefit from the social ties that are intended in social media. Regarding the lacking quality of content, Venkatesh and Bala [44] highlight the importance of information -related characteristics of a system as positively influencing user acceptance and system success. They outline that  X  X f a system can provide users relevant information on a timely manner, accurately, and in an under standable format and help them make better decisions, it is more likely that users will perceive greater job relevance of the system, high output quality, and greater result demonstrability. X  ([44] , p. 294). DiMicco et al. [8] found that personal profiles play a crucial, but at the same time c hallenging, role. They furthermore argue that profiles need to be dynamic, changing according to a user X  X  activity elsewhere on the site (e.g., when writing a comment or creating content), and they need to be customizable, allowing the user to choose which information to display where on the page [8]. Holtzblatt et al. [16] consider personal profiles and pictures as particularly relevant for strengthening connections across organizational boundaries and geographic distances. Regarding information and content, Geyer et al. [13] have developed a recommender system for profiles at IBM , which actually  X  X ecommends X  content for users to create and therefore encourage s users to actively involve themselves as contributors rather than as passive consumers. The emphasis on and potential of the  X  X ocial X  when introducing social media in companies needs to be taken seriously. Besides the personal profiles that add social clues, the ma tching of specific people to collaborate is also part of this social potential, such as finding experts to support novices. Yarosh et al. [45] inves tigated in depth how and in what situations people looked for help in a large enterprise. What was found, for instance, is that selection criteria for finding the right helper are crucial to be supported by a tool, such as experience, group affiliation, or  X  X omeone like X X . Implication : Let the communities define and explicitly indicate what they consider meaningful content (e.g., through recommendations of content). Nevertheless, the management might also provide examples or  X  X ole models X  of what they think is meaningful content to support employees who prefer having examples to relate to. Furthermore, avoid redundant information (e.g., do not provide the same information via email , Intranet and social media to the employees), but decide carefully how t o distribute the information. For instance, urgent information might be best communicated via email, but information that is meant to inspire ideation or feedback might be better articulated via a forum on the social media platform. Furthermore, emphasize that such a platform offers the possibility to get multiple perspectives on a topic and facilitate possibilities to socially connect to others in meaningful ways (e.g., throug h expert -novice matching support). With the studies presented here, w e want to draw attention to the complexity of corporate social media, their potentials, as well as pitfalls that might come with the integration. The extensive assessment of opinions (both quantitative and qualitative) over a period of two years enabled us to uncover a variety of aspects related to everyday work with social media in companies. Based on the reflection of the results , complemented with findings from related work , we were able to identif y three challenges : (1) diverging perspectives &amp; uncertain top -down communication, (2) functionality jungle &amp; high usage complexity, and (3) lacking collaboration &amp; customization. In the context of corporate social media, addressing those challenges and considering our proposed implications might imply a variety of strategies a company might pursue. However, as our presented studies were conducted within a very specific organization by evaluating the adoption of a particular corporate social media platform, the findings might not be directly transferred to other organizations or platforms. Nevertheless, our implications can provide valuable guidance to support smooth adoption processes, and hence might lead to successful collaboration s via corporate social media as part of day -to-day collaboration practi ces. However, with these challenges further questions arise that we will investigate as part of our future work, such as how social ties can be better supported (beside profiles), or how the employees can be further motivated to contribute with meaningful content. Furthermore, we will address the identified challenges in technology acceptance and adoption, by broadening our perspective in terms of investigating technology appropriation (practices) for meeting social purposes (i.e., communication and collaboration) . All this will support us in achieving our overall research goal, i.e., to understand what the social is that companies emphasize when referring to social media for their internal collaboration.
