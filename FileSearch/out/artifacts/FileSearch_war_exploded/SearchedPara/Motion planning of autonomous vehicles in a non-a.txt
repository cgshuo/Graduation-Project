 1. Introduction As a result of the DARPA Urban Challenge ( Buehler et al., 2007 ;
Seetharaman et al., 2006 ), Google Cars ( Marko, 2010 ), and similar projects (e.g. Pradalier et al., 2005 , Sotelo et al., 2004 ), there has been an increased effort towards making vehicles autonomous and addressing the pertinent open issues. Such vehicles can not only add a lot of personal comfort for passengers but also considerably increase the safety of the overall traffic system ( Bishop, 2000 ).
However, realising vehicle autonomy opens up issues relating to obstacle detection, localisation, control, planning, coordination, etc. ( Montemerlo et al., 2008 ). Many approaches assume an inter-vehicle communication mechanism to solve the issues ( Tsugawa, 2002 ; Reichardt et al., 2002 ), which however is not a practical assumption to make.

In most papers in the literature the presence of speed lanes is assumed and hence a vehicle planner is given the task of deciding when to change lane, the speed of travel, and a trajectory for lane changing. Broadly speaking, these models regard a decision to change between speed lanes as a high level decision, and speed control as a low level decision. High level decisions are then taken based on the positions of other vehicles and the feasibility and utility of a change ( Schubert et al., 2010 ; Furda and Vlacic, 2011 ). Such decisions may be used to imitate overtaking behaviours ( Naranjo et al., 2008 ; Hegeman et al., 2009 ) which play a major role in enabling vehicles to drive at high speeds. Low level decisions meanwhile are based more on safety measures.

Conversely, we advocate here that an optimal overall travel plan may not be possible with the presence of speed lanes. Diversity is an important factor that plays a role in making the employment of speed lanes non-optimal. As an example, diversity in vehicle widths makes it possible for multiple vehicles to lie within the same speed lane or to lie between speed lanes (p 35, Sewall et al., 2011 ), both of which increase the bandwidth. Otherwise even small vehicles would have occupied a single speed lane thereby restricting the bandwidth to the number of speed lanes. Further, large variations in speed make it mandatory for higher speed vehicles to overtake lower speed vehicles as early as possible, as well as for lower speed vehicles to be overtaken by higher speed vehicles. In uniform traffic a vehicle has no problem in following another vehicle, however while driving in a car one would not like to follow a bicycle moving on the road. Our study is based on such a traffic scenario which may be easily termed as an unorganised traffic.

To motivate the notion we take a look at traffic on Indian roads. Vehicle widths may vary from two-wheeled motor bikes, to three-wheelers (including auto rickshaws), to 4-wheeled cars and 8-wheeled trucks, while the speed varies from manually ridden bi-cycles to fast cars. As a result it is natural for drivers not to follow marked speed lanes, overtaking has become a fairly common sight, expectation from a smaller (slow moving) vehicle is to respect a larger (faster moving) vehicle and to allow it space to overtake, and vehicles may temporarily use the  X  X rong side X  of a dual carriageway to carry out an overtake (from the point of view of problems of traffic prediction, characteristics are also explained in Vanajakshi et al., 2009 ). While many readers may argue that these are not good traffic practices, we strongly emphasise here that in fact such an approach potentially leads to higher bandwidths and better traffic efficiency.

Driver aggression also has a role to play in the dynamics of an organised traffic which is limited to accelerating or decelerating one 0 s own vehicle, risk prone cut-ins and speed lane changes, use of the horn, etc. ( McGarva and Steiner, 2000 ; Lajunen et al., 1999 ;
Shinar and Compton, 2004 ). In the absence of speed lanes aggression plays an even greater role and governs critical deci-sions such as whether or not to overtake a vehicle in front.
Unorganised traffic has an apparent higher risk of accidents, and this needs to be a factor for consideration in design of a planning algorithm. We hence studied traffic accident causes for organised traffic ( Clarke et al., 2005 ; Paulsson and Thomas, 2005 ;
Wang et al., 2010 ) and unorganised traffic ( Mohan and Bawa, 1985 ; Mohan, 2002 ). For unorganised traffic, two wheelers are particularly prone to accidents ( Clarke et al., 2004 ; Jain et al., 2009 ). Analysis reveals that most, if not all, of the head-on collisions on non-crossing scenarios are caused by factors absent in autonomous vehicles which have active intelligent sensing and actuation systems. However this does place emphasis on keeping a safe distance from the vehicle in front so as to avoid accidents even if the vehicle in front stops suddenly. Accidents may however be possible when one vehicle crashes into the side of another vehicle, producing slight damage to both vehicles. Exces-sive steering is one reason for such a crash which, in a non-speed lane system, may be produced due to an attempt to incorrectly fit into the available space or wrongly trying to give another vehicle space in the road.

It is clear that unorganised traffic is advantageous in a number of countries. The challenge is how to get autonomous vehicles into such traffic, knowing that the underlying algorithms are prone to work only with speed lanes. Whilst engineering the complete vehicle would require localisation, vision, control, planning, etc. modules to be workable in unorganised traffic, only the problem of planning is considered in this paper. Further planning is restricted to a straight road scenario, while no effort is given to planning in cases of intersection, diversions, intersec-tions, complete road blockages, etc.

Hence the work may be seen as a positive step towards creating a complete planning framework for navigation of a vehicle in a mixed unorganised traffic. The proposed algorithm can be integrated with similar algorithms for other scenarios and other modules of an autonomous vehicle to create the overall framework. While it may be too immature at the present to judge the feasibility in creation of the overall framework, the impor-tance of the problem as a whole is emphasised. The purpose of this paper is also to attract the research community towards solving the other aspects of the problem, so that unorganised autonomous driving may become a reality.

In this paper the attempt is to study the possible behaviours in an unorganised traffic and further to model them in an algorithm.
The objective behind the algorithm is to be able to move an autonomous vehicle flawlessly within unorganised traffic. The algorithm must not make the vehicle either wait for a long time to move ahead (starve) or to cause accidents. The algorithm must also allow the vehicle to move by means of the optimal route and speed, at the same time allowing faster vehicles to overtake, and the vehicle to overtake slower vehicles whenever possible. The algorithm is modelled as a collection of behaviours, it assesses the current situation and selects the most appropriate behaviour based on which the vehicle is moved at any instant.
 unorganised traffic and identify behaviours; (ii) each behaviour is modelled in an algorithm used for the motion of autonomous vehicles in unorganised traffic; (iii) driver aggression is studied and modelled as an algorithmic parameter in such traffic; (iv) simulation studies are carried out on a number of synthetic scenarios, based on which traffic dynamics of unorg anised traffic are observed. simulated vehicle behaviour on straight roads and crossings without traffic lights. They discussed vehicular behaviours where one vehicle could follow another vehicle, overtake another vehicle, or multiple vehicles could result in a traffic jam. The limitations include the assumption of inter-vehicle communica-tion, no cooperation between vehicles, the algorithm seemed to be lane-prone and the overtaking decision module did not generalise to a high number of vehicles with unorganised pat-terns. Meanwhile Leonard et al. (2008) chose Rapidly-exploring
Random Trees (RRT) for planning a vehicle, although the algo-rithm was non-cooperative. Kala and Warwick (2011) used the
RRT-Connect algorithm for planning multiple vehicles. However the algorithm assumed that inter-vehicle communication, was non-cooperative, and could not be scaled to a large number of vehicles. Furda and Vlacic (2011) used Automata by which they could show the behaviours of maintenance of position on the road, maintenance of a safe distance from other vehicles, collision avoidance, etc. The selection of behaviour was through Multi-
Criterion Decision making. The assumption of speed lanes how-ever make the behaviour set small and simple.
 robot path planning where the problem is to move the robots from their sources to goals. Most approaches ( Aguirre and Gonzalez, 2000 ; Beom and Cho, 1995 ) use sensors that sense the environ-ment around, assess the situation, and use fuzzy based methods to move the robot. While mobile robotics often considers open spaces as the map, traffic scenarios have predefined roads which are long and narrow (in comparison)  X  this makes a big difference. In traffic scenarios no particular point is regarded as the source and goal, and safety is an important concern. Hence these methods are different from road following behaviour in traffic scenarios, and they have different behaviours and dynamics.
 was taken to maximise the distance from obstacles. In our paper we have used a similar idea whereby a vehicle attempts to maximise its separation from other vehicles. The maximisation effort is however under a threshold and only lateral separations are considered. We further extend this basic notion to develop complex behaviours and cooperative measures, which was absent in their work. Jolly et al. (2010) modelled the various behaviours observed in robotic soccer. The rule set was built with discrete field regions, which were later learnt using a fuzzy neural net-work. Whilst driving exhibits more complex behaviours, driving behaviours are clearly discrete in nature.
 algorithm is discussed in Section 2 . Individual behaviours modelled in the algorithm are described in Section 3 . Simulation of the algorithm results in a number of interesting observations with the use of multiple vehicles. Such multiple behaviours are studied via simulations in Section 4 . Some concluding remarks are then given in
Section 5 . 2. Problem and solution modelling 2.1. Problem modelling
The basic problem considered here is to safely move a vehicle in a scenario amidst multiple robotic or manually driven vehicles.
Hence consider a road segment which is characterised by its two boundaries say Boundary 1 and Boundary 2 , lying on either side of the road. A vehicle R i is assumed to be rectangular of length len and width wid i . The speed of the vehicle is changed by accelera-tion (or retardation) over the interval [-accMax i , accMax maximum speed of any vehicle is fixed to a value of v Max
Although the general planner we have developed here works for all types of roads, having any kind of curves, this behaviour study is restricted in the first instance to a straight road. As a result, while initiating any behaviour a vehicle assumes the road ahead to be straight and infinitely long. The reason for this is that completion of a manoeuvre might involve cooperation of other vehicles about which the vehicle initiating the behaviour may never be sure. Since it will take a finite time for a manoeuvre to complete in coopera-tion with other vehicles, the vehicle needs to assume that the road is long enough for this. Further, the road is assumed to be straight in order to overcome decision making on dynamics based on the curve. Vehicles travelling on the same curve would differ in their time of travel depending upon their lateral position on the curve.
Study of behaviours such as diversions, merging, and crossing scenarios are not within the scope of this current work. In this approach we deal with two coordinate systems: the
Cartesian coordinate system (XY) and a road coordinate system ( X 0 Y 0 ), which has the X 0 axis as Boundary 2 and the Y 0 axis is and the width of the road measured in the Cartesian coordinate system (Eq. (1) ). This factor is also known as the speed lane occupancy of the vehicle. Notations are shown in Fig. 1 . The road coordinate axis system enables easier lane keeping in a curved road and anticipating other vehicles 0 positions on roads with irregular widths.

Each vehicle R i keeps a track of all the vehicles in its neighbourhood. Tracking however is prone to be erroneous and such errors can be especially high if the other vehicle is at a distance. As per the uncertainty model used, the position of vehicle R j as measured by vehicle R i in the X 0 axis is given by Eq. (2) and the speed of vehicle R j as measured by vehicle R given by Eq. (3) .
 D x 0 ij  X  puMag  X  e D v 0 ij  X  vuMag  X  e v  X  X  v j D v 0 ij , v j  X  D v 0 ij here puSpread is the positional uncertainty spread and puMag is the positional uncertainty magnification factor. Similar factors for speed are vuSpread and vuMag .

The visibility of any vehicle is restricted to a distance of D ( v along the length of the road. In the present implementation we keep this factor linearly proportional to the current speed of the vehicle v another vehicle beyond this factor. In natural driving this factor is infinite for straight roads and depends upon the degree of curvature for non-straight roads. However th e factor is restricted to the limits of the computational load of the obstacle discovery algorithm. We further assume that all roads are one way, in other words the roads are clearly divided for inbound and outbound traffic. 2.2. Aggression factor
Aggression is a commonly used term to assess a driver 0 sperfor-mance. Though there is no clearly defined metric to express how aggressive a driver is, aggression is qualitatively assessed with close cut-ins, too many lane changes, close overtakes, sharp speed changes and manoeuvres etc. The cons of aggressive driving include passenger discomfort, risk of accidents, and discomfort for other drivers who have to be more alert and reactive. The pros of aggressive driving include usually a shorter travel time for the aggressive driver. This advantage of the aggressive driver may trigger a corresponding disadvantage for a non-aggressive driver, who may have to take cautious steps to ensure safety causing their travel time to be longer. Traffic is an adversarial system, whe re the different vehicles may not be able to simultaneously exhibit their optimal plans or in other words the different vehicles compete to be near-optimal. Aggressive drivers are usually more towards a win situation (with associated cons of aggressive driving) while the less aggressive drivers are more towards the lose situation. As an ex ample consider a scenario where a road narrows so as to allow only one of two competing vehicles to go forth. In such a scenario a more aggressive driver would normally make their way through. Of course if both drivers are very aggressive, a collision would occur.

One of the important tasks in the algorithm is to model aggression as an algorithmic factor. In all displays of aggressive driving we see that the driver keeps very little separation from other vehicles or obstacles. The distance from the vehicle directly ahead is always enough to ensure no collision if the vehicle suddenly stops, and it barely contributes to aggression. The separation which constitutes aggression is the separation that a vehicle plans to keep from the other vehicles and obstacles at its side. In a lane-based system this parameter is pre-set which is the width of a lane minus a vehicle 0 s width. In a non-lane-based system, this is a parameter.

The algorithm must always plan to keep a separation of more than separMin i at side, where separMin i is called the aggression factor. A larger separation would be preferred for increased safety, even if it separation of separMax i the path is regarded safe enough and any attempt to increase separation further would only be done if it brings an incentive in terms of the path length or travel time. We study this here by an example. Consider a vehicle is driving behind another vehicle and wants to overtake i t. If the vehicle behind cannot construct an overtaking trajectory, such that the separation of the projected motion is always greater than separMin i from sides, the overtake would not happen. However if the road is wide enough, the overtake would happen with the two vehicles separated by a lateral separation of approximately separMax i . If the overtaking vehicle attempts to steer any further, it would make its path worse while adding no safety. If the road is not w ide enough, the lateral separation would be kept to as large as possible. 2.3. Algorithm modelling
The entire algorithm is modelled as a collection of behaviours that we need the vehicle to display. The different behaviours are inter-related to each other. The overall behaviour to be displayed depends upon the surrounding vehicles. In this manner the approach is similar to the use of a rule based system for navigation of the vehicle. In a system with speed lane the rules can only produce a single output indicating the speed lane to travel along. However in this paper speed lanes are not in play, hence many more behaviours must necessarily be exhibited. While some of the behaviours may sound similar to a speed-lane based system, the ability of a vehicle to showcase similar behaviours in the absence of speed lanes adds to the differences between our work and that of others.

Each behaviour has a set of conditions which must be true for the vehicle to display that particular behaviour. Even whilst one behaviour is being displayed the conditions for other behaviours need to be checked. Each behaviour has its own priority which is used to decide which behaviour needs to be executed when a number are possible. Our notion of behaviour is simple. Consider driving on the road. In some situation a driver may decide to overtake a vehicle ahead. In another situation it may be necessary to overcome an obstacle. These actions constitute different behaviours. At any time instant the decision taken results in the behaviour which is best for a vehicle in cooperation with the other vehicles. Here we do not showcase two such behaviours simultaneously, say overtaking a vehicle and avoiding an obstacle, an actual behaviour would be one of them only.

With the stated modelling scenario and assumptions, the set of behaviours are constructed with the following hypotheses: (i) No interesting behaviour may be initiated if it appears to (ii) The aim of the algorithm is to attempt to increase the (iii) In case a separation of more than separMax i is available, the (viii) At every instance the attempt is to have the maximum 3. Behaviours 3.1. Obstacle avoidance the vehicle to avoid an obstacle. Consider that the current we first compute the best avoidance point considering all the obstacles that lie within D ( v i ).

Segments of this line would lie in regions without obstacles and segments within obstacles. A vehicle may either avoid an obstacle on its left side or right side. The vehicle simply selects the widest segment for its navigation. Let the widest segment be defined by the set of points [a, b] D [Boundary 2 ( p x 0 ), Boundary this segment, the vehicle must attempt to move such that it has to change its relative position in the Y 0 axis by a minimal amount and the obstacle is avoided by as large a separation (under a threshold of separMax i ) as possible in the Y 0 axis. By these objectives the point of avoidance P ( p x 0 , p y 0 ) at a distance of p given by Eq. (4)
Here wid i is the width of the vehicle and rl is the width of the road given by rl  X  : Boundary 1  X  x 0  X  Boundary 2  X  x 0  X  : vehicle 0 s normal path at a distance of separMax i from both sides.
In some cases the segment might however be too small for a vehicle to move without the desirable maximum separation, in which case it simply tries to maximise the separation by driving right at the middle as stated in Eq. (4) (ii). In case the segment is wide enough to allow a separation of more than separMax i both sides and the vehicle by its normal course does not enjoy  X  : rl  X  wid i = 2  X  separMax i r b this separation, planning is done so that the least amount of steering or change in relative position is required. If the point of avoidance lies towards the left side of the infeasible segment the scenario is given in Eq. (4) (iii) and if it lies on the right side of the feasible segment the scenario is given in Eq. (4) (iv). The various cases are depicted in Fig. 2 . The additional line shown is the planned trajectory which is not actually traced because an obstacle is encountered in the line of motion.

Out of all the competing points the best obstacle avoidance point OA is chosen which is the rightmost point for a right turn obstacle avoidance (or leftmost for a left turn obstacle avoidance) along the considered road length ( x i 0  X  l ). Selection of the rightmost (or leftmost) point assures that no steering is required for obstacles in the road length beyond OA while a vehicle should be able to drive to OA with minimum separation. In other words the intent is to steer as much as possible and then drive straight.
The trajectory of a vehicle t from its current position R constructed using spline curves. Every point t ( t ) on the curve must be in the free configuration space z i free of the vehicle (which accounts for a minimal separation of separMin i ) for the trajectory to be accepted. The procedure is given by Algorithm 1 . Algorithm 1. Obstacle Avoidance( R i , map) l  X  while true 3.2. Centring
Even though it might be comfortable for the vehicle to travel with its current relative position y 0 in the Y 0 axis, it may alternatively plan to slowly drift towards the road centre. Since the drift is slow, it does not require a large steering effort on the vehicle 0 s part. Advantages of driving in the centre include easier adaptation to bends/curves and variations in road widths. In order for this behaviour to be initiated, there must be no slower vehicles or obstacles ahead of the vehicle along the road length
D ( v ). The vehicle must itself be travelling at a reasonable speed, which ensures that this behaviour is not invoked at low speeds, when it is not relevant. The vehicle chooses the point of aim at the used for trajectory generation. 3.3. Lane change
A lane change in itself is not a behaviour but rather a precondi-tion which must be true for a number of behaviours including obstacle avoidance and centring. In other words it may be seen as a super behaviour which incorporates a number of behaviours in itself. The enabling condition of this super behaviour leads to the enabling conditions of the sub-behaviours. A possible lane change is queried when any vehicle needs to change its relative position y 0 by areasonableamount.

Every vehicle, as a safety precaution, needs to ensure that it keeps a sufficient safety distance from the vehicle in front, considering its own acceleration limits. This means that even if the vehicle in front was to stop suddenly, no collision would occur. However this does not account for the scenario wherein another vehicle might suddenly cut in from the side thereby forcing the vehicle to re-compute its speed and adjust accord-ingly. If the vehicle is travelling at a good speed and a vehicle suddenly comes in front from the side, it may not be able to decelerate fast enough to avoid a collision. Even if only a part of the vehicle cutting in lies ahead of the vehicle in question, a collision is possible.

Hence any change in lane is allowed only if the vehicle can complete the entire trajectory of lane change without needing any vehicles in the rear to slow down. Consider that the vehicle R needs to change its speed lane as per the trajectory t .Indoingsoit changes its relative position (or lane) from y i 0 to y t 0 . The time required by the vehicle to do so is given by the following equation: t  X  : t : = v i  X  5  X  here : t : indicates the total length of the curve t and v current speed of the vehicle. It is assumed that no other vehicle lies within the speed lane occupancy of y i 0 to y t 0 of R i .Vehicle R that all other vehicles continue to move at the same speed with the same relative positions as per the uncertainty model till time t. Hence the predicted path of a vehicle from the current time to time t may be given by the following equation which is an extension of Eqs. (2) and (3) :  X  t  X  X  X  x 0 j D x 0 ij  X  X  v j D v 0 ij  X  : t , x 0 j  X  D x
It is assumed here that while vehicle R i travels on its trajectory t , other vehicles plan as per Eq. (6) . If this results in a potential collision, vehicle R i will need to take an alternative behaviour. It is evident that only vehicles having any part of their vehicle within the lane occupancy of y i 0 to y t 0 of R i need to be checked. Further if vehicle R i has a smaller operating speed than any of the other vehicles it might have to lower its speed in order to avoid a collision. However it would have sufficient time to do this. 3.4. Overtaking
Since vehicles potentially have large differences in speed, it may not be  X  X air X  for a vehicle R i with high speed capability to follow a slow vehicle. Hence if it is possible it tries to overtake the slower vehicle in front. The vehicle in front is firstly assessed. Any part of the vehicle should lie within the relative position of [ y i 0 -(wid i /2  X  separ Min i )/rl, y i 0  X  (wid i /2  X  separ Min of vehicle R i . The term denotes the speed lane occupancy of R with minimum thresholds at both ends. Here rl is the current road width. While multiple vehicles are potential candidates for the vehicle R i to overtake, it is essential to select one such vehicle only. Hence we select the vehicle which is closest to the vehicle R (in terms of its position in the Y 0 axis) unless it lies far apart in terms of distance in the X 0 axis. In simple terms this means that a vehicle a long way ahead is not as significant as a vehicle a reasonable distance ahead, whilst a vehicle directly in front is preferred over a closer vehicle which is to the side. This means it is not only the vehicle directly in front which needs to be overtaken, but also any vehicle that is in front of the vehicle at a distance of separMin i from both sides.
Consider that the vehicle in front is R j . Let l j be the distance available to the left of R j measured along the Y 0 axis (beyond which some other vehicle or road boundary lies) and r j be the distance available to the right of R j . Note that if no vehicle is in front, the vehicle does not exhibit this behaviour. Two scenarios arise  X  direct overtaking and assistive overtaking. 3.4.1. Direct overtaking
Direct overtaking can take place by a vehicle R i when there is sufficient distance on either the left or right hand side of another vehicle R j so that R i may simply steer and slip in. In order to slip in
R requires a minimum distance of wid i  X  2.separMin i considering the minimum separation that it must maintain from both ends.
The first decision to be made however is the side that overtaking will take place  X  that is whether R i overtakes R j on the left or right.
Mostly overtaking on the right is what happens in countries which drive on the left and vice versa. However in a situation with wide lanes and no speed lanes overtaking on the right may not always be possible. The decision only needs to be made when sufficient distance from both sides is available else the side having sufficient distance can only host the overtake. A simple overtaking rule is defined here, which states that in the case when
R is more towards the left side of vehicle R j , overtaking takes place on the left and vice versa. If R i is exactly behind R overtaking takes place on the right.

The other task to be carried out is to decide on the position or the point of overtake P( p x 0 , p y 0 ) to which the vehicle must travel.
The trajectory t is calculated until a point P( p x 0 , p traversing which the overtaking would have happened, or the vehicles would be aligned, so that travelling straight would complete the overtake. We break the decision separately into the computation of p x 0 and p y 0 . The value p y 0 denotes the relative position of the vehicle R i on either side of the vehicle R decided. The same concepts are used as noted in Eq. (4) . The value of p y 0 is given Eq. (7) .

Eq. (7) (i) holds when a separation of more than separMax available on the left side of vehicle R j and left is the overtaking side. If the same distance is not available and overtaking needs to take place on the left side, vehicle R i simply attempts to maintain as large a distance as possible to other vehicles. Similarly Eq. (7) (iii) is when separation separMax i is available and Eq. (7) (iv) when this separation is not available. Notations are shown in
Fig. 3 for a random scenario for which one condition of Eq. (7) may be active.
 the vehicle should align itself and attain the value of p
Y 0 axis. Normally the overtake would not have been completed when the vehicle reaches the point P( p x 0 , p y 0 ) but this behaviour has more to do with arranging the relative positions of all vehicles and facilitating conditions such that R i may travel straight ahead at high speed. Hence we allow enough distance along the length of the road for R i to steer as per needs. A higher deviation in relative position from the current position along the Y 0 axis means a larger distance along the X 0 axis for alignment. Further, high speed may require large distances along X 0 axis for the same magnitude of steering. The value of p x 0 may then be given by the following equation: p 0 x  X  c 1  X  c 2 : v i  X  c 3 : abs  X  y 0 p 0 y  X  : rl  X  8  X  here c 1 , c 2 , c 3 are constants. c 1 is the minimal distance across the X 0 axis needed to produce a smooth curve as per spline curves.
Usually this is set to be twice the length of the vehicle. c meanwhile denote contributions of the factors of speed and steering requirements. 3.4.2. Assistive overtaking an overtake may still be possible but it requires the assistance of other vehicles. For the overtake to be possible the other vehicles must rearrange themselves by steering and changing their rela-tive positions on the road, thereby allowing R i adequate space to overtake. In order to check whether such a scenario is possible we iteratively traverse both the left (and right) hand side of the vehicle in front R j , at every iteration moving to the vehicle on its left (and right). Subtracting a basic constant amount equivalent to the presumed minimal width for every vehicle, we get a rough idea of the maximum separation available. If vehicle R i itself comes into any iteration, it is not considered. If this space is more than wid i  X  2.separMin i , the vehicle may decide to overtake.  X  4 side  X  lef t 4 side  X  lef t 4 side  X  right 4 side  X  right
Whether an overtake actually happens or not is uncertain as vehicles may have larger minimum thresholds and not offer enough room for R i to pass through. It is even possible that vehicles may have smaller thresholds, and hence a feasible over-take is not attempted.

Further it is possible that multiple vehicles might simultaneously want to overtake with no one vehicle having enough separation of its own to overtake. We do not model here cooperative behaviour in which all vehicles decide which one overtakes, but rather we consider an aggressive behaviour in which they all attempt to overtake. It is quite possible therefore that because of the aggression no vehicle is able to actually overtake at a specific time. The decision whether to initiate overtaking or not is also critical. If the vehicle decides not to overtake, it displays a simple behaviour such as following vehicles in front of it. However if it tries to overtake, it constantly pushes other vehicles to give it more space so as to make its desired overtake possible.

If an overtaking procedure is initiated, R i must choose its relative position in terms of alignment in the Y 0 axis such that some time later it might overtake easily if possible. Once more it might overtake a vehicle directly in front ( R j ) either from the left or right side, decided purely on the basis of whether it is more towards the left or right of the vehicle. We compute the point of p 0 is kept the same as it was in Eq. (8) . Considering the minimum distance to be available, the value of p y 0 is given by the following equation:  X  8 &lt; :  X  9  X  Trajectory generation t is done by the use of a spline curve.
Once the trajectory t is constructed the task for the vehicle is to travel along it. While the trajectory is planned and fixed, the only thing to be monitored and changed is the speed so as to avoid any collisions. The attempt is to make the vehicle travel with the highest speed possible. Hence at any time while executing the trajectory let the vehicle in front be at a distance of d units in front measured from the front of the vehicle R i to the back of the vehicle in front. The minimum separation of separMin i needs to be maintained and further it needs to be assumed that the vehicle in front may stop suddenly. The maximum deceleration is taken to be (-accMax i ). Hence if v i is the current speed of the vehicle, the changed speed at the next instant v i 0 is given by the following equation: vm  X  O  X  2 : acc Max i : max  X  d separ Min i , 0  X  X   X  8 &gt; &lt; &gt; : here vm is the maximum speed as per the distance available.
Whichever is the scenario of overtaking, the other vehicles in the vicinity need to be made aware of the vehicle R i attempting to overtake. This information helps them in their planning. In the case of an assistive overtake the other vehicles need to move and create space as we will see later. In the case of direct overtaking vehicles need to be prevented from accidently moving in the opposite direction and reducing the available separation. For manual vehicles this may be in the form of a horn or similar gesture commonly used in traffic while overtaking. Autonomous vehicles may additionally have some alternative inter-vehic le communication. This is the only bounded communication expected/allowed in the simulation. The overtaking gesture is updated at eve ry decision making cycle. When-ever a vehicle finds a situation not suitable for overtaking in any manner, the gesture is stopped. This would be, for example, when the vehicle has already completed an overtake and vehicles ahead are now to the side, or when the vehicles in front have left enough room for the vehicle R i to comfortably drive straight ahead, or the overtake is later found infeasible. The infeasibility may be due to a reduction in road spacing or perhaps a new vehicle entering parallel to the stream of vehicles ahead.

Another prerequisite is that vehicles which are being overtaken must be travelling straight or on the opposite side (left or right) from which the overtaking is being initiated. This resolves any conflict of interest wherein a sufficient separation is seen and the vehicle initiates overtaking only to find that the vehicle in front continuously moves to the opposite side thereby reducing the available separation. If either of the scenarios does not hold or vehicles are not seen to be travelling straight or on the opposite side or a change of lane request is denied, no overtaking is possible. 3.5. Be overtaken A related behaviour along with overtaking is to be overtaken. In assistive overtaking a vehicle expects the vehicle in front to give it more separation. Hence whenever possible the vehicle in front must cooperate and allow the vehicle behind to overtake. For this behaviour a vehicle R i scans all the vehicles requiring to overtake behind it within a relative position of [ y i 0 (wid i /2  X  separ Max y  X  (wid i /2  X  separ Max i )/ rl ]. Note the use of separMax separMin i . This is done for 2 reasons. Firstly the vehicle behind say R may have a higher value of separMin i , which means that even if the vehicle R i sees the vehicle R j having enough distance to go ahead, it might actually not proceed. To enable an overtake the vehicle R i must further give more space for vehicle R j to overtake. Secondly giving more space than the minimal amount is always considered better as per the modelling problem. Out of all the available vehicles the vehicle R i selects the vehicle R j closest to it in terms of separation in the X 0 axis. R i the side which R j wants to overtake by the same rules.
Now R i must give the necessary separation to R j for overtaking, or at least the maximum that it can give. In case it does not have adequate separation, further space may be given by a vehicle to the side of R i or various vehicles may steer themselves and move in due course of time (as we shall see in later behaviours) giving more separation to R i to allow space for R j . Let l i be the separation available with R i on its left and r i be the separation available on its right. Assuming that the separation thresholds (minimum and maximum) of the two vehicles are the same, the separation needed by R j may be anywhere in the range [wid j  X  2.separMin wid j  X  2.separMax i ], which needs to be created within the separa-tion available with R i which is ( l i  X  r i ), also considering the minimum separation requirements of R i .
 Say the vehicle R j needs to overtake R i on the right, which means R must drift leftward to facilitate the overtake. Since R i leftwards, the space r i is already available for R j to overtake, making the requirements within the range [ a , b ]  X  [wid j  X  2.separMin wid j  X  2.separMax i r i ]. The preferred relative position of R account for the overtake of R j is given by the following equation:  X  given by fs  X  l i  X  r i wid j
Eq. (11) (i) is the case when no assistance from R i is required and there is sufficient space (with separMax i distance additional at both sides) available for R j on the right side of R i deals with the case when R i is unable to give sufficient space, keeping the minimum separation reserved for itself and hence it can give the maximum separation possible to R j . Eq. (11) (iii) is the case when the separation available is not large enough so that R can enjoy a separation of separMax i from both their ends. Hence the available separation (fs) is equally divided between R .

The case in Eq. (11) (iv) is when R i can offer a separation of b to R which is the maximum that it needs.
 A similar equation is used when R j overtakes R i on the left side.
The process of selecting an equivalent p x 0 and using this as the space creation point is similar to the method discussed earlier. Similarly the trajectory is generated and the vehicle is moved.
Again caution needs to be taken that distances are only measured if vehicles are travelling straight or drifting to the side needed by
R . Lane change behaviour is checked for every vehicle other than
R which is overtaking. 3.6. Maintain separation steer
This behaviour attempts to maximise a vehicle 0 s separation from both sides, under a threshold of separMax i , in cases where steering may increase the separation. Say the vehicle R i separation of l i units on the left and r i units on the right. Separations are regularised by selecting a regularisation point the same as those considered with the lane change super behaviour.

Eq. (12) (i) is operative when the behaviour is not applicable; that is when the vehicle enjoys a separation of more than separMax i on both sides or when it cannot enjoy a separation of separMin i on both sides. Eq. (12) (ii) and (iii) satisfy the condition when a vehicle enjoys a separation of more than separMax i one side and less separation on the other side, while the total separation is such that the vehicle can enjoy its threshold value separMax i on both sides. Eq. (12) (iv) attempts to centre the vehicle by maintaining equal separation on both sides. 3.7. Slow down
If a vehicle, by any steering mechanism, cannot enjoy a distance of more than separMin i on both sides (that is l i  X  r i o 2.separMin there is a potential threat of collisions due to uncertainties, possible control errors, etc. This situation marks the state of the vehicle where it is not  X  X omfortable X  driving due to the very low separation available. Whenever this situation is encountered, vehicle R decreases its speed by its a maximum amount making the new speed as v 0  X  max( v i accMax i , 0). Since the dynamics of the road, in terms of the relative positions of vehicles, is constantly changing it is possible later that the separation needed will be available and the vehicle can accelerate again. Further, as there is a possibility that a vehicle going ahead may create more space so that other vehicles can adjust and create space for the vehicle R i . In case the separation is continuously low, R i could instead join the stream of vehicles behind it, or follow the stream of vehicles in front. Note that a slowing down of vehicle R i would mean its separation being eventually distributed across the stream of other vehicles. 3.8. Discover conflicting interests that two vehicles showcase behaviours which, when executed simultaneously, lead to collision. Consider the scenario in Fig. 4 , the two vehicles compute and aim to occupy the same space in front, and hence their trajectories, when executed, would lead to a collision. Such a situation rarely happens in daily life that two vehicles simultaneously make opposing plans. If one of the vehicles had been a little late in decision making, the other vehicle would have displayed its intention to turn. This intention was a consideration in all the behaviours involving separations. monitored while one vehicle traverses its planned trajectory t .If this distance happens to be such that after unit move of both vehicles the separation would be less than the minimum thresh-old, vehicle trajectories are straightened. The point of straighten-ing is computed whose value in the Y 0 axis is found by measuring the least subsequent motion in the Y 0 axis before the vehicle can straighten itself which is the projection of the vehicle 0 s length in the current Y 0 axis. 3.9. Travel straight behaviour as this deals with travelling straight on the road. There are no prerequisites for this behaviour, it can be invoked at any time and is usually invoked when there are no other behaviours to be exhibited. A small curve is generated for a unit move of the vehicle from the current position, keeping the relative position ( y 0 ) of the vehicle constant. The vehicle attempts to move by the highest speed possible given by Eq. (10) .

Table 1 . Note that many of the behaviours are specific in terms of their initiation and hence a change of their priority would not affect the algorithm. Priorities are useful only when multiple behaviours may simultaneously meet their preconditions. various behaviours have been listed one after the other. Lane change behaviour is marked by lane_change( t ) which returns true if a change is possible. This charact eristic also appears in most other behaviours. If a behaviour results in the generation of a trajectory t ,  X  4 r 4 separMax i the same is returned in the plan, which becomes the input for the next time instance. A non-null value of t signifies a behaviour being followed and the same behaviour should be followed unless it has been completed. In all cases where t is null, a new behaviour is searched for. Behaviours which complete in unit move (such as moving straight) return a null value of t , signifying a behaviour was selected and was completed in the same step.

The simulation tool was developed in MATLAB. Base modules carried the task of boundary determination, vehicle tracking, graphical display, distance measurements. Different behaviours were coded as separate modules. Scenarios could be generated by specifying entry times, initial speeds, maximum speeds, max-imum accelerations, and sizes of vehicles. The map was supplied as an image file. The algorithm was tested for various scenarios which are discussed in subsequent sections. 4.1. General traversal
The first task associated with the testing of the algorithm was assessing the ability of a vehicle to travel along any general road. A number of maps were given to a single vehicle for its traversal. All these maps involved some challenges as to the method of taking a turn or the smoothness of the overall path. The results in three of the scenarios, each having a different road orientation, are presented in Fig. 5 . Since only one vehicle was travelling in the scenario, encouragement was given to centring.

Fig. 5 (a) shows a gradual turn where the vehicle was supposed to turn smoothly, before encountering a major straightening of the road. Clearly the straightening was sudden and non-smooth and we see that the vehicle was able to handle this by its planning, making the entire curve relatively smooth to follow with high speeds. Fig. 5 (b) depicts quite the opposite behaviour where the road is almost straight with a sudden curve right at the end. Such roads are a common phenomenon especially in crossing like situations. Fig. 5 (b) shows the path of the vehicle which was as smooth as possible in making the turn. Fig. 5 (c) meanwhile shows a road where the complete road segment may be broken down into further segments. The challenge was not so much to travel within segments but rather to steer between segments.
While the vehicle makes a smooth steer in the first change, the manner of handling the second change is unique and no major steering is visible. 4.2. Obstacle avoidance
The next major challenge associated with autonomy in vehi-cles is to be able to avoid any static obstacles, while still maintaining a smooth trajectory. The challenge becomes even more difficult when the vehicle is to avoid an obstacle in the presence of a curved road or another vehicle. We have studied here various possibilities via simulations, the results of which are presented in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6 (a) shows a road with a general curve and an obstacle. The vehicle was supposed to plan its smooth trajectory such that it is centred at the road end and the obstacle is avoided comfortably. The same analysis for a straight road and single vehicle is shown in Fig. 6 (b). The same scenario was again used for an additional vehicle and the trajectory of the two vehicles is shown in Fig. 6 (c and d). Note that the vehicle which originated lower in the scenario was generated later. This vehicle needed to drive straight, keeping its relative distance constant to avoid the obstacle. Hence here a straight driving behaviour was applicable rather than obstacle avoidance. The first vehicle, generated in the middle of the road, saw the obstacle ahead but was not allowed to change lanes to overtake it, as is shown in
Fig. 6 (c). Hence instead it slowed down, waiting for the other vehicle to cross. It then passed the obstacle, as shown in Fig. 6 (d). 4.3. Overtaking
The next behaviour we explicitly studied was overtaking. We were interested primarily in vehicular behaviours which are best visible on a straight road but which are also common scenarios in travelling. The simplest scenario is when a vehicle comes from behind and attempts to overtake the vehicle in front with a lot of space to do so. The corresponding trajectory is shown in Fig. 7 (a).
The overtaking vehicle keeps the maximum possible distance possible as per its set value of separMax i while overtaking.
It quickly uses a trajectory of centring due to seeing no other vehicle in the vicinity, apart from the vehicle it has already overtaken. The same scenario was repeated with the overtaking vehicle being more aggressive than the vehicle being overtaken (in terms of its separMax i value). The trajectory in such a case is shown in Fig. 7 (b). Here the vehicle being overtaken feels it is possible to increase separation and be safer for the brief period of time the vehicle is overtaking. This is because of its less aggres-sive nature, more cautious driving, indicated by a larger value of separMax i .
 not have enough separation to overtake. The vehicle being over-taken was hence expected to move while the overtaking vehicle aligned itself. As soon as the vehicle attempting to overtake obtained enough separation, so overtaking was initiated. The corresponding trajectory is given in Fig. 7 (c). Fig. 7 (c) shows the importance of cooperation by the vehicle being overtaken to the overtaking vehicle. Overtaking is important to allow the two vehicles to drive at their maximum speeds as it might be  X  X ainful X  for a fast vehicle to follow a slow vehicle. Cooperation of the vehicle being overtaken first makes it possible to make overtaking possible and allows the vehicle to benefit from the same.
Secondly it eliminates the need of the overtaking vehicle to steer by very large amounts which would make overtake a cumber-some job. Cooperation of the vehicle being overtaken by drifting leftward by some amount does not make its travel any worse; on the other hand it allows the overtaking vehicle to overtake easily and smoothly. 4.4. Complex formulation sub-sections, basic vehicular behaviours are well-understood.
Hence many vehicles may be simulated over a road segment where each vehicle displays its individual behaviour at every time instant. We have identified one of the unique behaviours and wish to use this for our discussion. The complete scenario is shown in Fig. 8 and is also presented in Video 1 . In this simulation all vehicles have a different value of aggression factor, indicated by separMin i .

The first two (smaller) vehicles were generated simultaneously and travelled parallel to each other on the road. After some time two more (larger) vehicles were generated simultaneously. The newly generated vehicles were capable of higher speeds and attempted to overtake the slower vehicles. The faster and larger vehicles travelled on either side of the road, forcing the two smaller vehicles to create some separation for them. Each of the vehicles computed the total available space and believed that overtaking was possible, which might actually not be the scenario as two vehicles are simultaneously trying to overtake, each blocking the chances of the other vehicle. The smaller vehicles attempted to create some separation and moved to the opposite side, each unaware of the contradictory plans of the other vehicle.
The vehicles soon displayed conflicting interests and straightened their trajectories.

The motion henceforth was purely driven by aggression factors. The top smaller vehicle was less aggressive (having a higher value of separMin i ) and attempted to maintain a larger separation (equal in magnitude to its separMin i ) from the bottom small vehicle. Hence it steered slightly to the top/left when the desired magnitude of separation was not available. However the bottom small vehicle was more aggressive with a smaller value of separMin i . It saw the separation created as a possibility to create more separation for the bottom bigger vehicle. When the bottom vehicle moved towards the top so the top vehicle again saw that the separation available was less than the magnitude desirable. So it steered more towards the top. The bottom vehicle hence kept pushing the top vehicle, till the required separation was available for the bottom large vehicle to overtake, accounting for its additional minimum separation value.

Once the required separation was available the bottom large vehicle overtook as shown in Fig. 8 (a). The centring behaviour was disabled and the vehicle travelled straight. Upon completion of overtaking there was ample separation available for the smaller bottom vehicle and it easily created a separation of separMax itself on both sides. However the small top vehicle was still struggling to create necessary separation for the larger vehicle behind it. It steered towards the bottom thereby reducing the separation of separMax i for the bottom small vehicle. The bottom small vehicle further steered towards the bottom to maximise the distance. In this manner reverse pushing occurred as the top vehicle pushed the bottom vehicle to create separation for the large vehicle at the rear. As soon as the required separation along with the minimum separation threshold was available for the larger vehicle, overtaking took place as is shown in Fig. 8 (b).
Finally the two smaller vehicles travelled straight, parallel to each other.

We repeated the same experiment, but this time the value of the aggression factors remained constant. This scenario is naturally symmetric and hence no vehicle was capable of pushing another vehicle as was witnessed in Fig. 8 . The result was that the smaller vehicles kept looking for an opportunity to give the larger vehicles more separation, but they were unable to do so for the entire journey. The scenario is shown in Fig. 9 and Video 1 . 4.5. Aggression
In order to judge the working and effectiveness of the aggres-sion factor we considered another scenario. A narrowing road was constructed with three vehicles travelling on it. It is evident that if all three vehicles travelled parallel to each other, none would be able to reach the end of the segment. However if aggression factors are different for the vehicles, it would be expected that more aggressive vehicles would reach the end, whilst less aggressive vehicles would fear danger at some time and would give way to other vehicles, allowing them to go ahead. To maximise the effect all vehicles were given generally high values of separMin is discussed here and shown in Fig. 10 . The bottom vehicle was most aggressive followed by the central and top vehicle. Hence reasonably early in the journey both the central and top vehicles waited for the bottom vehicle to go ahead. 5. Conclusions
The objective of the research described here was to construct a planning algorithm for an autonomous vehicle amidst other non-autonomous vehicles and obstacles. The motivation was to solve the problem of planning along straight roads for autonomous vehicles driving in countries without speed lanes. Further effort was to advocate the absence of speed lanes for a diverse traffic system which autonomous vehicles may bring in the future. The absence of speed lanes brought about a rich set of behaviours which were identified and modelled.

The overtaking behaviour is particularly exciting, wherein it is difficult to decide which set of vehicles facilitate the overtaking of which other vehicles. At any time the vehicle could display any of the behaviours depending upon its state and the conditions that govern the execution of the behaviour. As in natural driving, aggression is another important factor which affects traffic dynamics. Experiments were performed for a variety of scenarios.
Vehicles were tested for their ability to avoid obstacles, go around curved roads, overtake, help other vehicles overtake, and perform complex formulations.

Being primarily a reactive technique, some oscillations were found, especially in centring behaviour on curved roads, discover-ing conflicting interests behaviour, and prior to and post comple-tion of overtaking. Such oscillations may be controlled using some deliberation. One of the ways of doing the same may be to project the possible immediate moves of all the vehicles to get a snapshot into the future, which is further used to project the vehicles to get the snapshot more into the future, and so on till the vehicle is likely to be at the segment end. The entire plan may then be additionally locally optimised, smoothened, shortened/straigh-tened, etc. The approach needs to be extended to other planning problems such as planning in intersections, mergers, etc. and planning in the case of special incidents such as the sudden breakdown of the vehicle in front, a road block, etc. Another limitation of the current work is that it has neither been validated on real traffic data sets nor is entirely evolved from real data sets. Currently we are however unaware of any such data sets for unorganised traffic. Unlike organised traffic, vehicles in unorga-nised traffic are difficult to track and dynamics are difficult to record. Recording and studying such real traffic would enable validation of the method as well as observing new interesting behaviours.

This study should particularly be helpful in overtaking deci-sion making. Natural vehicles may be seen to give preference to certain vehicles which are more socially accepted or may use other indicators to make decisions tussle-free between vehicles. Similarly real data sets would reveal more realistic modelling of aggression and how it affects the traffic landscape. Planning represents one of the many modules of autonomous vehicles, and all such modules need to be able to perform in the absence of speed lanes to enable vehicles to operate in real traffic. The major research issue is designing and validating the performance of other modules in the absence of lanes.
