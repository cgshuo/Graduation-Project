 To pic recommendation can help users deal with the information overload issue in micro-blogging communities . This paper proposes to use the implicit information network formed by the multiple relationships among users, topics and micro-blogs, and the temporal information of micro-blogs to find semantically and temporally relevant topics of each topic, and to profile users' time-drifting topic interests. The Content based, Nearest Neighborhood based and Matrix Factorization models are used to make personalized recommendations. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated in the experiments conducted on a real world dataset that collected from Twitter.com. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval-Information Filtering; H.5.3 [ Information Interfaces and Presentation ]: Group and Organization Interfaces-Collaborative computing Algorithms, Experimentation Temporal dynamics, Topic Recommendation, Micro-blogs, Collaborative Filtering, Personalization, Web 2.0 Mic ro-b logs is one kind of popular Web 2.0 information. Rather than a pure social network like Facebook, a micro-blogging platform is regarded as an information network [9] , where many people use it for information purpose [9]. With the rapid growth of user numbers, there are a large number of topics emerging every day . They not only include a small number of hot/stream topics, but also a large number of less popular ones. To help users solve the information overload issue, it is important to recommend personally interesting topics to users. Although the latest version of Twitter has embedded the function of recommending topics (e.g., hashtags, popular keywords) to users, the academic research of making personalized topic recommendations based on micro-blogs has attracted less attention so far. Recently, the social tie or social interaction information of micro-blogs have been used to discover communities [ 14], make recommendations [5]. However, more recent research findings [9 ] suggest that social tie information may not be very helpful for users who use micro-blogging environment for information purpose, since users with similar topic interests may be not explicitly connected, and weak ties often can provide access to novel information [9 ]. Thus, making better use of the content information of micro-blogs is crucial for topic recommendations . On the other hand, micro-blogs contain implicit information network formed by the multiple relationships among users, micro-blogs, and topics. The se relationships can be used to find content relevant topics, which is ignored by other approaches. Another unique feature of micro-blogs is that the topics are temporally associated with each other. The temporal information of topics can help to find relevant topics, which should be considered. Moreover, the fact that the topics of micro-blogging communities change quickly with time [6 ] makes it necessary to recommend topics that are not only topically appropriate, but also have been talked or published in the recent past. Thus, how to capture the temporal dynamics especially recency information in micro-blogs and profile users' time-sensitive topic interests is very important . In this paper, we propose to make use of the temporal information and the multiple relationships among users, topics and micro-blogs to make personalized topic recommendations. The research of recommender systems in micro-blogging communities is mainly focusing on recommending news [ 10], URLs [5], and users to follow [3]. Although some work like [ 10] considered the temporal dynamics of micro-blogs, how to incorporate the recency information to find temporally associated topics still needs to be explored. Time-aware latent topical models [8] can be used to find the latent topics in micro-blogs. However, as latent topics are usually broad or abstract, the recommendations of specific topics, such as hashtags and keywords, are more applicable in micro-blogging communities. With a list of recommended specific topics such as hashtags and keywords, users can read those micro-blogs that are relevant to the recommended topics and publish micro-blogs with these topics to participate in discussions or conversations directly. Temporal dynamics in recommender systems are of great importance [1] . For example, Koren [1] m odeled the time factors for each user in a factorization model. Xiang et. al. [12] proposed a graph based approach to hybrid users' short-and long-term preferences. However, these approach es were based on users' explicit or implicit ratings and did not consider the content information of items. Moreover, the patterns of temporal variations of micro-blogs [2 ] are different with the items such as movies, research papers that were used in these approaches. Efron et. al. [7 ] proposed temporal models to rank recent tweets. Different with the problem of ranking tweets [7] , this paper focus es on the recommendation of topics. We define the key concepts that are used in this paper:  X  Micro-blogs (e.g., tweets):  X  = {  X  1 ,  X  2 , ... ,  X   X  Topics:  X  =  X  1 ,  X  2 , ... ,  X   X  contains all topics of micro-blogs  X  Topic assigning: is to assign a topic to an item. Similar to Let  X   X   X  X  X  be a target user,  X   X   X  be the latest time stamp of  X   X  ,  X   X  stamp set of  X   X  the candidate topic set that is unknown to  X   X  and is more recent than  X   X   X  predict ion score of how much  X   X  would be interested in  X  pro blem of topic recommendation is defined as generating a set of ordered topic s  X   X  , ... ,  X   X   X   X   X  ... X  X  X  (  X   X  ,  X   X  ) and  X   X  In a micro-bl ogging community, User-Microblog is the basic relationship. The introducing of explicit (i.e., hashtagging behaviour) or implicit topic assigning behaviours form multiple relationships among users, micro-blogs and topics .  X  User-Microblog relationship: This includes User- X  User-Topic relationship: This records each user X  s topics and  X  Topic-Microblog relationship: This records each micro- X  User-Topic-Microblog relationship: This records each user X  X  The multiple relationships of micro-blogs can be used to find each user's topic interests and the related topics of each topic, which will be discussed in the following sub sections . T he process of determining the time-aware related topics of each topic and representing each topic with a set of content relevant and temporally associated topics is called topic representation. [Definition 1] (Topic Representation): represents the time-aware content relevant topics of a given topic  X   X   X  X  X  with respect to all set of topics in time period  X  can be defined as the mapping  X   X  (  X  )  X   X  is called the topic representation of topic  X  For a given topic  X   X   X  X  X  , b ased on the Topic -U ser Mapping, we can get the user set of this topic denoted as  X   X   X   X  X  X   X  be obtained based on the personal topic assigning relationship (User  X Topic)-Microblog Mapping . In the viewpoint of this user, the topics of these micro -blogs are closely related. Let  X  denote the time -aware relevance weight of a given topic  X  another topic  X   X   X  X  X  in terms of user  X   X  . It can be estimated based on the average relevance weight of  X   X  to every  X   X  denote the relevance weight of  X   X  to  X   X  .  X   X  ,  X   X   X  ,  X  is the number of occurrence of  X   X  in  X   X  decay that shows strong performance in recency ranking of miro -blogs [7] is adopted to measure the recency decay . It is formed by the function  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  , where  X  is the decay rate and  X  X  X  is the time in hours (or in days ) that has elapsed from the current time . Let  X  ,  X   X  be the time stamp set of  X   X   X  ,  X   X  ,  X   X  stamp of  X   X  rece ncy weight of  X   X  for  X   X  can be calculated as  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X   X  The overall relevance of two topics  X   X  and  X   X  through calculating the sum of the relevance weight of  X  for all the users of  X   X   X   X  X  X   X  Assuming each micro -blog is equally important, t he more micro -blogs of topic  X   X  are contributed by user  X   X  , the more important  X  is for the topic representation of  X   X  . Let  X   X  importance weight of  X   X  to the topic representation of  X  the popularity of  X   X  in all topic representation s should be consider ed. By considering the importance weight of  X  popularity of  X   X  ,  X   X  ,  X   X  (  X  ) can be calculated as: Where  X  X  X  X  (  X   X  ) is the inverse topic frequency of  X   X   X  X  X  X  (  X  + |  X   X  2.72 , |  X   X  User profiles are used to describe users X  interests and preferences information. The process of finding time-aware topic preferences of each user is called user representation. It is defined as below: [Definition 2] (User Representation) : represents the time -aware topic preferences of each user. Let  X   X  ,  X   X  (  X  ) how much the user  X   X  is interested in topic  X  relationship between a user and a set of topics in time period  X  can be defined as the mapping  X   X  (  X  ) :  X  X  X  2  X   X [0,1] , such that representation of  X   X  . interested in  X   X   X  X  X   X  contain  X   X  indicates how strong this user is interested in  X  use the ratio between the number of micro -blogs that contain  X  and generated by  X   X  , and the total number of micro -blogs generated by user  X   X  , to measure the preference weight of  X  denoted as  X   X  we can get the time -aware relevance weight  X   X   X  in terms of  X   X  . As discussed in Section 4.2,  X  consider s the recency weight of each topic  X   X  for the user representation of  X   X  . The older the time stamp of the micro -blogs generated by user  X   X  with the topic  X   X  are, the less important  X  for the user represenation of  X   X  . Thus, we can measure each user  X   X  X  preferences to the topic  X   X   X  X  X  through calculat ing the prod uct of  X   X  Where  X  X  X  X  (  X   X  ) is the inverse user frequency of  X   X  X  X  X  (  X  + |  X   X  described by  X   X  , 0 &lt;  X  X  X  X   X   X   X  1 .  X   X  (  X  )  X  In this section , based on the user and topic representations, three kinds of recommendation approach es are proposed. The content based approach is popularly used to recommend items that have similar contents to each target user X  X  topic interests. The content similarity between  X   X  and candidate topic  X   X   X   X  and  X   X  (  X  )  X   X  . This paper uses the Cosine similarity to measure  X  should be considered,  X  X  X  X   X   X  the time stamp set of  X   X  , and  X   X   X  The content matching between  X   X  and  X   X  is defined as: The prediction score that measures how much  X   X  will be interested in  X   X  can be calculated based on their content matching value. Typically, the similarity of two users  X   X  and  X   X  can be measured by the similarity of their user profiles (i.e., user representations) . In a miro-blogging community, the discussion topics change with time quickly. For a given user  X   X  , the active time period of each peer user of  X   X  should not be ignored. Let  X  X  X  X  (  X  recency weight of each peer user  X   X  ,  X  X  X  X   X   X  where  X   X   X   X   X   X  is the latest time stamp of  X   X   X  .

We linearly combine the neighbourhood based and the content based approach. The prediction score of  X   X   X   X  (  X   X  ,  X   X  ) =  X  1  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X   X   X  ,  X   X  +  X  2  X  X  X   X  (  X  where  X  (  X   X  ) is the neighbourhood of  X   X  ,  X  = 1 to smooth the value of  X  X  X  X   X   X   X   X  ,  X   X   X  linear combination. 0  X  X  X  1  X  1, 0  X  X  X  2  X  1 and  X  1 +  X  The Matrix Factorization Model is typically used to predict the rating data [1]. It also can be applied on binary user behavior data after generating negative samples from missing values randomly [11 ]. Although there is no explicit ratings to topics in a micro-blogging environment, users' topic preferences derived from their micro-blogs can be viewed as users' implicit ratings to topics. In user profiling approach discussed in Section 4.3, are used as samples (i.e.,  X   X  ,  X   X  (  X  ) = 0 ) for each user. Let |  X  topics that  X   X  has, we randomly choose |  X   X  shown interests in as this user's negative samples in the training set . As the task is to recommend Top N new topics to users, we extend the test set with M number of randomly selected negative recommended to  X   X  . Let  X   X  X  X  denote the prediction score of  X  preferences to  X   X  , similar to [1 ][ 11], it can be calculated as: Where  X  is the average preference value for all topics. The parameters  X   X  respectively .  X   X   X  is the g -dimensional latent factor vector of  X   X  . Let  X  all the positive samples and  X   X  be all negative samples sam pled from missing values . A simple gradient descent technique was applied to minimize the following cost function: Similar to neighborhood based model , the final prediction score is linearly combined with the content based approach.

In this paper, we focus on hashtag recommendation task. As each user and each hashtag can be represented with a set of related hashtags, tag terms and keywords, the proposed models are:  X  HM : hashtag model . Each user and each hashtag is represented  X  TM : tag term model. Tag terms are used to represent each user  X  KM : keywords model. Keywords are used to represent each T he experiments were conducted on a real world data that crawled from Twitter.com . We randomly selected 6,000 users who have used hashtags in their tweets and collected each user  X  X  tweets from April 19, 2011 to April 25, 2011 . In the crawled raw dataset, nearly 16% of tweets contain hashtags. To avoid too sparse dataset , we only selected those users who have used at least 5 hashtags and their English tweets. The dataset D was split into training and test set. The statistical features of dataset D are shown in Table 1.
D 4 , 673 Users  X  191 , 720 Tweets  X  19/Apr/ 201 1~24/ Apr / 2011 Th e users that appeared in both training and test set were selected as the test user set. Each test user X  X  topics that appeared in the test set but did not occur in the training set of this test user was used as this user X  X  test topics. For a test user, a list of ordered topics that he/she has not used in his/her training set will be generated. If a topic in the recommendation list was in the test user's test topic set, then th is recommended topic was counted as a hit. We adopt Precision and Recall , and the HitRati o and HitTopics to evaluate the accuracy. For a given test user, if the recommended topics got at least one hit topic for this user, then this user is counted as a hit user. HitRatio denotes the total number of hit users over all test users, while HitTopics denotes the total number of hit topics of all test users . The parameters of the proposed approaches are set after intensive experiments. The exponential rate  X  =0.01 ,  X  X  X  was the elapsed time in hours. For neighbourhood based approach, K =100 ,  X  =0.1,  X  2 =0.9. For Matrix Factorization approach, the parameter settings are: M =100, g =60,  X  =0.004, maximum iteration step is 40,  X  =0.005,  X  1 = 0.4 ,  X  2 =0.6. Figure 1 shows the results of different topic and user representation models for the proposed content based approaches. The Top 5 Precision and Recall results of HM-Content , TM-Content , KM-Content are shown in this graph . Figure 1 shows that the content based approaches adopted tag term model (i.e., TM-Content ) performed better than the approach based on hashtag model (i.e., HM-Content ). It can be explained that quite a number of tweets not only contain hashtags but also contain tag terms that have been used by other users as hashtags. Although some users did not explicitly put hash symbols before these terms, they have similar topic interests with those users who have explicitly hashtagged these terms. Thus, more related topics can be obtained, which will help to find potential interested hashtags for each user. Moreover, TM-Content has similar performances with the approach based on keywords model (i.e., KM-Content ). As the number of keywords usually is much larger than the number of tag terms, tag term model is computationally more efficient than the keywords model. Tag terms can be viewed as user selected document features of micro-blogs. With high accuracy and relatively low computation complexity, overall, the tag term model performed better than the other two model s. The comparison of the three proposed recommendation approaches based on tag term model are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 . Results of Different 
Recommendation Approaches based on Tag Term Model Figure 2 shows that TM-MF performed better than the other two approaches. Figure 3 shows that with the increase of M value, both the Top-3 precision results of the proposed Matrix Factorization approach TM-MF , and MF , the matrix factor approach that does not combine content matching results, decreased. This is because that adding more negative samples in the test set usually will increase the error rate. Thus, this approach may unfairly take the advantage of the large proportion of positive samples in the test set, when only a very small number of negative samples were added to the test set. The content based approaches have less parameters and are computationally more efficient. In this set of experiments, we compared the accuracy values of TM-Content with those related state-of -the-art temporal and non-temporal baseline methods. For fair comparison, the temporal baseline approaches adopted the same exponenti al decay function.  X  CF-User : This is the standard user based collaborative filtering  X  tf-i df : each user and topic are weighted by tf-idf approach [5].  X  MF-tf-idf : It is based on the tf-idf weighted user topic profiles.  X  MostPopular : recommend the most popular hashtags to users.  X  MostRecent : recommend the most recent hashtags to users .  X  MostRecentPopular : recommend the most recent and popular  X  ContentRecency : This approach is based on tf-idf approach and The Top-10 HitRatio and HitTopics results of these baseline models are shown in Figure 4 . The Top 5 precision and recall results of TM-Content, and two better performed baseline models MostRecentPopular and ContentRecency are shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 , the proposed approach TM-Content performed the best. Compared with other approaches, t he Most Recent approach had the worst performances. This suggests that the accuracy of recommendations may be extremely low if we only recommend the most recent topics to users . The MostPopular approach also failed to work well , as only a very small number of topics were popularly used by all users. The results also suggest that it is very important to make personalized recommendations recommend those hot stream ing topics to users. The proposed approach es had the best performance. They rel y on the multiple the recency information to find the time -aware content relevant topics of each topic and the time -aware topic preferences of each user.

Rather than using explicit social tie information, this paper focuses on making use of the implicit information network formed by the multiple relationships among users, topics and micro-blogs and the temporal information of micro-blogs, to expand topics and profile users . Furthermore, the content , neighborhood and Matrix Factorization based recommendation approach es are presented . The results of hashtag recommendation task show that the proposed approaches are effective. Future work will explore how to incorporate social influence of users to recommend topics. funded by, the Smart Services Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) through the Australian Government X  X  CRC Programme (Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research).
