 Most objects and data in the real world are of multiple types, interconnected, forming complex, heterogeneous but often semi-structured information networks. However, most network science researchers are focused on homogeneous networks, without distinguishing different types of objects and links in the networks. We view interconnected, multi-typed data, including the typical relational database data, as heterogeneous information networks, study how to lever-age the rich semantic meaning of structural types of objects and links in the networks, and develop a structural analysis approach on mining semi-structured, multi-typed heteroge-neous information networks. In this article, we summarize a set of methodologies that can effectively and efficiently mine useful knowledge from such information networks, and point out some promising research directions. We are living in an interconnected world. Most of data or informational objects, individual agents, groups, or com-ponents are interconnected or interact with each other, forming numerous, large, interconnected, and sophisticated networks. Without loss of generality, such interconnected networks are called information networks . Examples of information networks include social networks, the World Wide Web, research publication networks [8], biological net-works [12], highway networks [24], public health systems, electrical power grids, and so on. Clearly, information net-works are ubiquitous and form a critical component of mod-ern information infrastructure. The analysis of information networks, or their special kinds, such as social networks and the Web, has gained extremely wide attentions nowadays from researchers in computer science, social science, physics, economics, biology, and so on, with exciting discoveries and successful applications across all the disciplines. We propose to model real-world systems from different ap-plications as semi-structured heterogeneous information net-The work was supported in part by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement No. W911NF-09-2-0053 (NS-CTA), NSF IIS-0905215, MIAS, a DHS-IDS Center for Multimodal Information Access and Synthesis at UIUC, and U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research MURI award FA9550-08-1-0265.

Different from many existing network models that view interconnected data as homogeneous graphs or networks, our semi-structured heterogeneous information network model leverages the rich semantics of typed nodes and links in a network and uncov-ers surprisingly rich knowledge from the network.
 For example, in a bibliographic database like DBLP PubMed 2 , papers are linked together via authors, venues and terms, and in Flickr 3 , a social website, photos are linked together via users, groups, tags and comments. Different kinds of knowledge can be derived from such an information network view, such as discovery of clusters and hierarchies, ranking, topic analysis, classification, similarity search, and relationship prediction. These functions facilitate the gener-ation of new knowledge in ubiquitous online databases and other online or offline systems in almost every industry. For example, different research areas and ranks for authors and conferences can be discovered by such analysis in a biblio-graphic database, which will be useful for the users to better understand the data and obtain valuable knowledge.
 This article presents an overview of the techniques developed for information network analysis in recent years. The moti-vation and related concepts are briefly introduced in Section 2. The major mining tasks and techniques are presented in Section 3, and more advanced topics are in Section 4. In Section 5, we propose several research directions along the line of mining heterogeneous information networks. Finally, Section 6 concludes our study. In most of the current research on network science, social and information networks are usually assumed to be homo-geneous , where nodes are objects of the same entity type ( e.g. , person) and links are relationships from the same re-lation type ( e.g. , friendship). Interesting results have been generated from such studies with numerous influential appli-cations, such as the well-known PageRank algorithm [2] and community detection methods. However, most real world networks are heterogeneous , where nodes and relations are of different types. For example, in a healthcare network, nodes can be patients, doctors, medical tests, diseases, medicines, http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/  X  ley/db/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ http://www.flickr.com/ hospitals, treatments, and so on. On one hand, treating all the nodes as of the same type ( e.g. , homogeneous informa-tion networks) may miss important semantic information. On the other hand, treating every node as of a distinct type ( e.g. , labeled graph) may also lose valuable schema-level in-formation. It is important to know that patients are of the same kind, comparing with some other kinds, such as doc-tors or diseases. Thus, a typed, semi-structured heteroge-neous network modeling may capture essential semantics of the real world .
 Typed, semi-structured heterogeneous information networks are ubiquitous. For example, the network of Facebook con-sists of persons as well as objects of other types, such as photos, posts, companies, and movies; in addition to friend-ship between persons, there are relationships of other types, such as person-photo tagging relationships, person-movie liking relationships, person-post publishing relationships, and post-post replying relationships. A university network may consist of several types of objects like students, pro-fessors, courses, and departments, as well as their interac-tions, such as teaching, course registration or departmental association relationships between objects. Similar kinds of examples are everywhere, from social media to scientific, engineering or medical systems, and to online e-commerce systems. Therefore, heterogeneous information networks are powerful and expressive representations of general real-world interactions between different kinds of network entities in di-verse domains . An information network represents an abstraction of the real world, focusing on the objects and the interactions between the objects. It turns out that this level of abstraction has great power in not only representing and storing the essential information about the real-world, but also providing a useful tool to mine knowledge from it, by exploring the power of links. Formally, we define an information network as follows.
Definition 1. (Information network) An informa-tion network is defined as a directed graph G = ( V , E ) with an object type mapping function  X  : V  X  A and a link type mapping function  X  : E  X  R , where each object v  X  V be-longs to one particular object type  X  ( v )  X  X  , each link e  X  X  belongs to a particular relation  X  ( e )  X  R , and if two links belong to the same relation type, the two links share the same starting object type as well as the ending object type. Different from the traditional network definition, we explic-itly distinguish object types and relationship types in the network. Note that, if a relation exists from type A to type B , denoted as ARB , the inverse relation R  X  1 holds natu-rally for B R  X  1 A . R and its inverse R  X  1 are usually not equal, unless the two types are the same and R is sym-metric. When the types of objects |A| &gt; 1 or the types of relations |R| &gt; 1, the network is called heterogeneous information network ; otherwise, it is a homogeneous information network .
 Given a complex heterogeneous information network, it is necessary to provide its meta level ( i.e. , schema-level) de-scription for better understanding the object types and link types in the network. Therefore, we propose the concept of network schema to describe the meta structure of a network.
Definition 2. (Network schema) The network schema , denoted as T G = ( A , R ) , is a meta template for a heterogeneous network G = ( V , E ) with the object type mapping  X  : V  X  X  and the link mapping  X  : E  X  X  , which is a directed graph defined over object types A , with edges as relations from R .
 The network schema of a heterogeneous information net-work specifies type constraints on the sets of objects and relationships between the objects. These constraints make a heterogeneous information network semi-structured, guid-ing the exploration of the semantics of the network. An in-formation network following a network schema is then called a network instance of the network schema.
 Heterogeneous information networks can be constructed from many interconnected, large-scale datasets, ranging from social, scientific, engineering to business applications. Here are a few examples of such networks. 1. Bibliographic information network: A bibliographic information network, such as the computer science bib-liographic information network derived from DBLP, is a typical heterogeneous network, containing objects in four types of entities: paper (P), venue ( i.e. , confer-ence/journal) (V), author (A), and term (T). For each paper p  X  P , it has links to a set of authors, a venue, and a set of terms, belonging to a set of link types. It may also contain citation information for some papers, that is, links to a set of papers cited by the paper and links from a set of papers citing the paper. The network schema for a bibliographic network and an instance of such a network are shown in Fig. 1.
 (a) Schema of a bibliographic network Figure 1: A bibliographic network schema and a biblio-graphic network instance following the schema (only papers, venues and authors are shown). 2. Twitter information network: Twitter as a social media can also be considered as an information network, containing objects types such as user, tweet, hashtag and term , and relation (or link) types such as follow be-tween users, post between users and tweets, reply be-tween tweets, use between tweets and terms, and contain between tweets and hashtags. 3. Flickr information network: The photo sharing web-site Flickr can be viewed as an information network, con-taining a set of object types: image, user, tag, group , and comment , and a set of relation types, such as upload between users and images, contain between images and tags, belong to between images and groups, post between users and comments and comment between comments and images. 4. Healthcare information network: A healthcare sys-tem can be modeled as a healthcare information network, containing a set of object types, such as doctor, patient, disease, treatment , and device , and a set of relation types, such as used-for between treatments and diseases, have between patients and diseases, and visit between patients and doctors.
 Heterogeneous information networks can be constructed al-most in any domain, such as social networks ( e.g. , Face-book), e-commerce ( e.g. , Amazon and eBay), online movie databases ( e.g. , IMDB), and numerous database applica-tions. Heterogeneous information networks can also be con-structed from text data, such as news collections, by entity and relationship extraction using natural language process-ing and other advanced techniques.
 Diverse information can be associated with information net-works. Attributes can be attached to the nodes or links in an information network. For example, location attributes, either categorical or numerical, are often associated with some users and tweets in a Twitter information network. Also, temporal information is often associated with nodes and links to reflect the dynamics of an information network. For example, in a bibliographic information network, new papers and authors emerge every year, as well as their as-sociated links. Besides the structure information of infor-mation networks, such content information is also helpful or even critical in some tasks on mining information networks. Numerous methods have been developed for the analysis of homogeneous information networks, especially on social networks [1], such as ranking, community detection, link prediction, and influence analysis. However, most of these methods cannot be directly applied to mining heterogeneous information networks. This is not only because heteroge-neous links across entities of different types may carry rather different semantic meanings but also because a heteroge-neous information network in general captures much richer information than its homogeneous network counterpart. A homogeneous information network is usually obtained by projection from a heterogeneous information network, but with significant information loss. For example, a co-author network can be obtained by projection on co-author infor-mation from a more complete heterogeneous bibliographic network. However, such projection will lose valuable infor-mation on what subjects and which papers the authors were collaborating on. Moreover, with rich heterogeneous infor-mation preserved in an original heterogeneous information network, many powerful and novel data mining functions need to be developed to explore the rich information hidden in the heterogeneous links across entities.
 Why is mining heterogeneous networks a new game? Clearly, information propagation across heterogeneous nodes and links can be very different from that across homo-geneous nodes and links. Based on our research into mining heterogeneous information networks, especially our studies on ranking-based clustering [19; 22], ranking-based classifi-cation [10; 9], meta-path-based similarity search [18], rela-tionship prediction [15; 16], and relation strength learning [14; 20], we believe there are a set of new principles that may guide systematic analysis of heterogeneous information networks. We summarize these principles as follows. 1. Information propagation across heterogeneous types of nodes and links. Similar to most of the network analytic studies, links should be used for in-formation propagation in mining tasks. However, the new game is how to propagate information across het-erogeneous types of nodes and links , in particular, how to compute ranking scores, similarity scores, and clusters, and how to make good use of class labels, across hetero-geneous nodes and links. No matter how we work out new, delicate measures, definitions, and methodologies, a golden principle is that objects in the networks are in-terdependent, and knowledge can only be mined using the holistic information in a network . 2. Search and mining by exploring network meta structures. Different from homogeneous information networks where objects and links are being treated either as of the same type or as of un-typed nodes or links, het-erogeneous information networks in our model are semi-structured and typed, that is, nodes and links are struc-tured by a set of types, forming a network schema. The network schema provides a meta structure of the infor-mation network. It provides guidance of search and min-ing of the network and help analyze and understand the semantic meaning of the objects and relations in the net-work. Meta-path-based similarity search and mining has demonstrated the usefulness and the power of exploring network meta structures. 3. User-guided exploration of information networks.
In a heterogeneous information network, there often exist numerous semantic relationships across multiple types of objects, carrying subtly different semantic meanings. A certain weighted combination of relations or meta-paths may best fit a specific application for a particular user.
Therefore, it is often desirable to automatically select the right relation (or meta-path) combinations with ap-propriate weights for a particular search or mining task based on user X  X  guidance or feedback. User-guided or feedback-based network exploration is a useful strategy. In this section, we first introduce some fundamental mining tasks in heterogeneous information networks, which include clustering, ranking, classification, similarity search, relation-ship prediction, and relation strength-aware learning, and the methodologies we have developed to solve these tasks. We partition these tasks into three parts, mainly following the three principles introduced in the last section. Clustering, classification and ranking are basic mining func-tions for information networks. We introduce several studies that address these tasks in heterogeneous information net-works by distinguishing different types of links.
 Ranking-based clustering in heterogeneous informa-tion networks. For link-based clustering of heterogeneous information networks, we need to explore links across het-erogeneous types of data. Recent studies develop a ranking-based clustering approach ( e.g. , RankClus [19] and NetClus [22]) that generates both clustering and ranking results ef-ficiently. This approach is based on the observation that ranking and clustering can mutually enhance each other be-cause objects highly ranked in each cluster may contribute more towards unambiguous clustering, and objects more dedicated to a cluster will be more likely to be ranked high in the same cluster. It turns out that the accuracy of clustering results can be significantly enhanced compared with that ei-ther using projected homogeneous information networks or using only partial link information. Moreover, by integrat-ing ranking and clustering, a cluster can be understood eas-ily by reading the top-ranked objects in that cluster. Table 1 is a net-cluster ( i.e. , a network cluster following the schema of the original network) generated by NetClus [22] on the DBLP network, representing the database research area. Classification of heterogeneous information net-works. Classification can also take advantage of links in heterogeneous information networks. Knowledge can be ef-fectively propagated across a heterogeneous network because the nodes that are linked together are likely to be similar, and different types of links have different level of strengths in determining this similarity. Moreover, following the idea of ranking-based clustering, one can explore ranking-based classification since objects highly ranked in a class are likely to play a more important role in classification. These ideas lead to effective algorithms, such as GNetMine [10] and RankClass [9]. It turns out that by distinguishing differ-ent types of links in a heterogeneous information network, classification accuracy can be significantly enhanced. We then introduce a systematic approach for dealing with general heterogeneous information networks with a specified network schema, by using meta-path-based methodologies. Under this framework, similarity search and interesting min-ing tasks, such as relationship prediction, can be addressed. Different from homogeneous information networks, two ob-jects can be connected via different types of paths in a het-erogeneous information network. For example, two authors can be connected via  X  X uthor-paper-author X  path,  X  X uthor-paper-venue-paper-author X  path, and so on. Formally, these paths are called meta-paths , defined as follows.

Definition 3. (Meta-path) A meta-path P is a path defined on the graph of network schema T G = ( A , R ) , and is denoted in the form of A 1 R 1  X  X  X  A 2 R 2  X  X  X  ... R l  X  X  X  defines a composite relation R = R 1  X  R 2  X  ...  X  R l between
Figure 2: Bibliographic network schema and meta-paths. types A 1 and A l +1 , where  X  denotes the composition operator on relations.
 For the bibliographic network schema shown in Figure 2 (a), we list two examples of meta-paths in Figure 2 (b) and (c), where an arrow explicitly shows the direction of a relation. We say a path p = ( a 1 a 2 ...a l +1 ) between a 1 and a network G follows the meta-path P , if  X  i , a i  X  A i and each link e i =  X  a i a i +1  X  belongs to each relation R i in P . We call these paths as path instances of P , denoted as p  X  X  . Some path instance examples are shown in Table 2.
 Table 2: Path instances and their corresponding meta-paths in heterogeneous information networks.
 Via meta-paths, one can systematically specify how object types are connected in a network. Different meta-paths lead to different kinds of features. Multiple mining tasks can be explored under this framework.
 Meta-path-based similarity search in heterogeneous information networks. Similarity search plays an impor-tant role in the analysis of networks. By considering dif-ferent linkage paths ( i.e. , meta-path) in a network, one can derive various semantics on similarity in a heterogeneous information network. For example, Table 3 shows that us-ing different meta-paths, one can find different author lists that are most similar to Christos Faloutsos. A meta-path based similarity measure, PathSim, is introduced in [18], for finding peer objects in the network, which generates better results, compared with random-walk based similarity mea-sures. Another measure, HeteSim, introduced in [13], com-putes relevance score between objects of different types. Table 3: Top-10 similar authors to  X  X hristos Faloutsos X  un-der different meta-paths on the full-DBLP dataset. Meta-path-based relationship prediction in hetero-geneous information networks. Heterogeneous informa-tion network brings interactions among multiple types of objects and hence the possibility of predicting relationships across heterogeneous typed objects. By systematically de-signing meta-path-based topological features and measures in the network, supervised models can be used to learn the best weights associated with different topological features for effective relationship prediction [15; 16].
 As a case study, the co-authorship prediction problem is examined in [15], which outputs the most significant meta-paths for predicting co-authorships, as shown in Table 4, and also provides better understanding why co-author relation-ships are built. Note that, predicting co-authors for a given author is an extremely difficult task, as there are too many candidate target authors (3-hop candidates are used in anal-ysis), but the number of real new relationships are usually very small. Table 5 shows the top-5 predicted co-authors in time interval T 2 (2003-2009) using the T 0  X  T 1 (topological features are collected in 1989-1995 and co-authorship build-ing ground truths are collected in 1996-2002) training frame-work, for both the proposed hybrid topological features and the shared co-author feature. We can see that the results generated by heterogeneous features has a higher accuracy compared with the homogeneous one. The heterogeneity of relations between object types leads to different mining results that can be chosen by users. With user guidance, the strength of each relation should be auto-matically learned and used for better mining. We introduce Table 4: Significance of meta-paths with Normalized Path Count measure for HP 3 hop dataset.

 two different kinds of relation strength-aware mining tasks. Figure 3: Strengths for link types in two DBLP four-area networks .
 Relation strength-aware clustering via attribute se-lection. Links in networks are frequently used to regularize the attribute-based clustering tasks, that is, linked objects should have similar cluster labels. However, shall we trust links from different types equally? We propose GenClus [14] to address this problem. By specifying a set of attributes, the strengths of different relations in heterogeneous infor-mation networks can be automatically learned to help the clustering of objects. Table 6 shows a clustering case study for objects from different types in a DBLP network, where the network schema is in Fig. 3(a). Fig. 3 demonstrates the learned strengths for each relation for the clustering task for two different network schemas.
 Integrating user-guided clustering with meta-path selection. Different meta-paths in a heterogeneous infor-mation network represent different relations with different semantic meanings. User guidance in the form of a small set of training examples for some object types can indicate their preference on the results of clustering. The preferred meta-path or weighted meta-path combinations can be learned to reach better consistency between mining results and the training examples [20]. Figure 4: A toy heterogeneous information network contain-ing organizations, authors and venues. Figure 5: Author connection graphs under different meta-paths.

Example 1. (Meta-path-based clustering) A toy het-erogeneous information network is shown in Figure 4, which contains three types of objects: organization (O), author (A) and venue (V), and two types of links: the solid line rep-resents the affiliation relation between author and organi-zation, whereas the dashed one the publication relation be-tween author and venue. Authors are then connected (in-directly) via different meta-paths. For example, A  X  O  X  A is a meta-path denoting a relation between authors via or-ganizations ( i.e. , colleagues), whereas A  X  V  X  A denotes a relation between authors via venues ( i.e. , publishing in the same venues). A question then arises: which type of con-nections should we use to cluster the authors? Obviously, there is no unique answer to this question: dif-ferent meta-paths lead to different author connection graphs, which may lead to different clustering results.
 In Figure 5(a), authors are connected via organizations and authors are connected via venues and form two different a connection graph combining both meta-paths generates 4 clusters: { 1 , 3 } , { 2 , 4 } , { 5 , 7 } and { 6 , 8 } . In [20], the PathSelClus algorithm is proposed to learn the importance of each meta-path as well as output the cluster-ing results that are consistent with the user guidance. For example, to cluster authors into clusters in Example 1, a user may seed { 1 } and { 5 } for two clusters, which implies a selection of meta-path A  X  O  X  A ; or seed { 1 } , { 2 } , { 5 } , and { 6 } for four clusters, which implies a combination of both meta-paths A  X  O  X  A and A  X  V  X  A with about equal weight. Beyond the basic mining tasks discussed above, in this sec-tion, we introduce several advanced topics for mining infor-mation networks, which include role discovery, trustworthi-ness analysis, co-evolution analysis, text mining in informa-tion networks, and OLAP in information networks. Many of these tasks can help better refine the quality of information networks, and others will help better understand the content rich information networks. More advanced operators such as OLAP is also necessary for better exploring the networks. An information network contains abundant knowledge about relationships among objects. Unfortunately, such knowledge, such as advisor-advisee relationships among re-searchers in a bibliographic network, is often hidden. Role discovery is to uncover such hidden relationships by infor-mation network analysis. For example, a time-constrained probabilistic factor graph model, which takes a research pub-lication network as input and models the advisor-advisee relationship mining problem using a jointly likelihood ob-jective function has been developed [25]. It successfully mines advisor-advisee hidden roles in the DBLP database with high accuracy. Such mechanism can be further devel-oped to discover hierarchical relationships [26] and ontology among objects under different kinds of user-provided con-straints or rules. A major challenge for data integration is to derive the most complete and accurate integrated records from diverse and sometimes conflicting sources. The truth finding problem is to decide which piece of information being merged is most likely to be true. By constructing an information network that links multiple information providers with multiple ver-sions of the stated facts for each entity to be resolved, novel network analysis methods, such as TruthFinder [28] and LTM [30], can be developed to resolve the conflicting source problem effectively. In [7], the authors propose to detect copying relationships among sources, which turns out to be critical in resolving conflicts among sources. Trustworthy analysis will help data cleaning and data integration, hence improve the quality of information networks. Many current studies on network evolution are on homo-geneous networks. However, in the real cases, different re-lationships exist in the heterogeneous network, and multi-typed relationships will co-evolve together. Modeling co-evolution of multi-typed objects will capture richer seman-tics than modeling on single-typed objects alone. For ex-ample, studying co-evolution of authors, venues and terms in a bibliographic network can tell better the evolution of research areas than just examining co-author network or term network alone. Thus an important direction is how to model the co-evolution of multi-typed objects in the form of multi-typed cluster evolution in heterogeneous networks, such as EvoNetClus which builds a hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture model-based online model to study the real heterogeneous networks formed by DBLP and twitter [21]. Objects in information networks are usually associated with text information, and it is interesting to integrate the tra-ditional text mining problem with information networks. In [17], we propose a topic model, iTopicModel, which can generate topics not only based on the text information of documents but also based on the link information among documents. It turns out that the topic quality can be sig-nificantly enhanced especially when the text is sparse and link quality is high. In [6], the authors further distinguish the types of links between documents, and a biased prop-agation among different documents is considered. A novel topic model with biased propagation (TMBP) algorithm is proposed, which directly incorporates heterogeneous infor-mation network with topic modeling in a unified way. The underlying intuition is that multi-typed objects should be treated differently along with their inherent textual informa-tion and the rich semantics of the heterogeneous information network. Besides topic models, [5] proposes a joint regular-ization framework to enhance expertise retrieval by model-ing heterogeneous networks as regularization constraints on top of document-centric model, which can find high quality experts for a given query. The power of online analytical processing (OLAP) has been shown in multidimensional analysis of structured, relational data. Similarly, users may like to view a heterogeneous in-formation network from different angles, in different dimen-sion combinations, and at different levels of granularity. For example, in a bibliographic network, by specifying the ob-ject type as paper and link type as citation relation, and rolling up papers into research topics, we can immediately see the citation relationships between different research top-ics and figure out which research topic could be the driv-ing force for others. However, the extension of the concept of online analysis processing (OLAP) to multi-dimensional data analysis of heterogeneous information networks is non-trivial. Not only different applications may need different ontological structures and concept hierarchies to summa-rize information networks but also because multiple pieces of semantic information in heterogeneous networks are in-tertwined, determined by multiple nodes and links. There are some preliminary studies on this issue, such as [23; 3; 31], but the large territories of online analytical processing of information networks are still waiting to be explored. Viewing interconnected data as an information network and studying systematically the methods for mining heteroge-neous information networks is a promising frontier in data mining research. There are still many challenging research issues. Here we illustrate only a few. Many studies on mining heterogeneous information net-works assume that a heterogeneous information network to be investigated contains a well-defined network schema and a large set of relatively clean and unambiguous objects and links. However, in the real world, things are more compli-cated.
 A network extracted from a relational database may con-tain a well-defined schema which can be used to define the schema of its corresponding heterogeneous information network. Nevertheless, objects and links even in such a database-formed information network can still be noisy. For example, in the DBLP network, different authors may share the same name [27], that is, one node in a network may refer to multiple real-world entities; whereas in some other cases, different nodes in a network may refer to the same entity. Entity resolution will need to be integrated with network mining in order to merge and split objects or links and de-rive high quality results. Moreover, links in a network, roles of a node with respect to some other nodes may not be ex-plicitly given. For example, the advisor-advisee relationship in the DBLP network [25] is not given, but such kind of re-lationships can be critical for understanding the growth of a research community or for some other data mining tasks. Furthermore, sometimes the connections between different nodes may not be reliable or trustable. For example, the author information for a book provided by an online book store could be erroneous or inaccurate. Multiple Web-sites may provide conflicting or compensating information for the properties of certain objects. Trustworthiness modeling [30] could be critically important for data cleaning, data inte-gration, and quality network construction.
 Construction of high-quality heterogeneous information net-works becomes increasingly more challenging when we move away from relational databases towards increasingly more complicated, unstructured data, from text documents, to online web-based systems, multimedia data, and multi-lingual data. Information extraction, natural language un-derstanding, and many other information processing tech-niques should be integrated with network construction and analysis techniques to ensure high-quality information net-works can be constructed and progressively refined so that quality mining can be performed on better-quality hetero-geneous information networks.
 Notice that entity extraction, data cleaning, detection of hidden semantic relationships, and trustworthiness analy-sis should be integrated with the network construction and mining processes to progressively and mutually enhance the quality of construction and mining of information networks. Diffusion analysis has been studied on homogeneous net-works extensively, from the innovation diffusion analysis in social science [11] to obesity diffusion in health science [4]. However, in the real world, pieces of information or dis-eases are propagated in more complex ways, where different types of links may play different roles. For example, diseases could propagate among people, different kinds of animals and food, via different channels. Comments on a product may propagate among people, companies, and news agen-cies, via traditional news feeds, social media, reviews, and so on. It is highly desirable to study the issues on information diffusion in heterogeneous information networks in order to capture the spreading models that better represent the real world patterns. Although a network can be huge, a user at a time could be only interested in a tiny portion of nodes, links, or sub-networks. Instead of directly mining the entire network, it is more fruitful to mine hidden networks  X  X xtracted X  dynam-ically from some existing networks, based on user-specified constraints or expected node/link behaviors. For example, instead of mining an existing social network, it could be more fruitful to mine networks containing suspects and their associated links; or mine subgraphs with nontrivial nodes and high connectivity. How to discover such hidden net-works and how to mine knowledge ( e.g. , clusters, behaviors, and anomalies) from such hidden but non-isolated networks ( i.e. , still intertwined with the gigantic network in both net-work linkages and semantics) could be an interesting but challenging problem. As shown in the studies on ranking-based clustering and ranking-based classification, interconnected, multiple typed objects in a heterogeneous information network often pro-vide critical information for generating high quality, fine-level concept hierarchies. For example, it is often difficult to identify researchers just based on their research collabo-ration networks. However, putting them in a heterogeneous network that links researchers with their publication, con-ferences, terms and research papers, their roles in the net-work becomes evidently clear. Moreover, people may have different preferences over ontological structures at handling different kinds of tasks. For example, some people may be interested in the research area hierarchy in the DBLP net-work, whereas others may be interested in finding the author lineage hierarchy. How to incorporate user X  X  guidance, and generate adaptable ontological structures to meet users X  X  re-quirement and expectation could be an interesting and use-ful topic to study. Given real-world data are interconnected, forming gigantic and complex heterogeneous information networks, it poses new challenges to query and search in such networks intel-ligently and efficiently. Given the enormous size and com-plexity of a large network, a user is often only interested in a small portion of the objects and links most relevant to the query. However, objects are connected and inter-dependent on each other, how to search effectively in a large network for a given user X  X  query could be a challenge. Similarity search that returns the most similar objects to a queried object, as studied in this thesis [18] and its follow-up [13], will serve as a basic function for semantic search in het-erogeneous networks. Such kind of similarity search may lead to useful applications, such as product search in e-commerce networks and patent search in patent networks. Search functions should be further enhanced and integrated with many other functions. For example, structural search [29], which tries to find semantically similar structures given a structural query, may be useful for finding pattern in an e-commerce network involving buyers, sellers, products, and their interactions. Also, a recommendation system may take advantage of heterogeneous information networks that link among products, customers and their properties to make improved recommendations. Querying and semantic search in heterogeneous information networks opens another inter-esting frontier on research related to mining heterogeneous information networks. Most objects and data in the real world are interconnected, forming complex, heterogeneous but often semi-structured information networks. However, many database researchers consider a database merely as a data repository that sup-ports storage and retrieval rather than an information-rich, inter-related and multi-typed information network that sup-ports comprehensive data analysis; whereas many network researchers focus on homogeneous networks. Departing from both, we view interconnected, semi-structured datasets as heterogeneous, information-rich networks and study how to uncover hidden knowledge in such networks. In this article, we present an organized picture on mining heterogeneous information networks and introduce a set of interesting, ef-fective and scalable network mining methods. In addition, we also present several promising research topics in this ex-citing direction. [1] C. C. Aggarwal, editor. Social Network Data Analytics . [2] S. Brin and L. Page.
