 Rare words have long been a challenge to translate automatically using statistical methods due to their low occurrences. However, the Zipf  X  X  Law claims that, for any corpus of natural language text, the fre-quency of a word w quency table) will be roughly twice as high as the frequency of word w is that in any corpus, there are very few frequent words and many rare words.

We propose a novel approach to extract rare word translations from comparable corpora, relying on two main features.

The first feature is the context-vector similar-ity (Fung, 2000; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002; Laroche and Langlais, 2010): each word is charac-terized by its context in both source and target cor-pora, words in translation should have similar con-text in both languages.

The second feature follows the assumption that specific terms and their translations should appear together often in documents on the same topic, and rarely in non-related documents. This is the gen-eral assumption behind early work on bilingual lex-icon extraction from parallel documents using sen-tence boundary as the context window size for co-occurrence computation, we suggest to extend it to aligned comparable documents using document as the context window. This document context is too large for co-occurrence computation of functional words or high frequency content words, but we show through observations and experiments that this win-dow size is appropriate for rare words.

Both these features are unreliable when the num-ber of occurrences of words are low. We sug-gest however that they are complementary and can be used together in a machine learning approach. Moreover, we suggest that the model trained for one pair of languages can be successfully applied to ex-tract translations from another pair of languages.
This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss the challenge of rare lexicon extraction, explaining the reasons why classic ap-proaches on comparable corpora fail at dealing with rare words. We then discuss in section 3 the con-cept of aligned comparable documents and how we exploited those documents for bilingual lexicon ex-traction in section 4. We present our resources and implementation in section 5 then carry out and com-ment several experiments in section 6. There are few previous works focusing on the ex-traction of rare word translations, especially from comparable corpora. One of the earliest works is from (Pekar et al., 2006). They emphasized the fact that the context-vector based approach, used for processing comparable corpora, perform quite un-reliably on all but the most frequent words . In a context of words in source and target languages in-side context-vectors , then compares source and tar-get context-vectors using similarity measures. In a monolingual context, such an approach is used to automatically get synonymy relationship between words to build thesaurus (Grefenstette, 1994). In the multilingual case, it is used to extract translations, that is, pairs of words with the same meaning in source and target corpora. It relies on the Firthien hypothesis that you shall know a word by the com-pany it keeps (Firth, 1957).

To show that the frequency of a word influences its alignment, (Pekar et al., 2006) used six pairs of comparable corpora, ranking translations according to their frequencies. The less frequent words are ranked around 100-160 by their algorithm, while the most frequent ones typically appear at rank 20-40. We ran a similar experiment using a French-English comparable corpus containing medical doc-uments, all related to the topic of breast cancer , all manually classified as scientific discourse . The French part contains about 530,000 words while the English part contains about 7.4 millions words. For this experiment though, we sampled the English part to obtain a 530,000-words large corpus, matching the size of the French part.

Using an implementation of the context-vector similarity, we show in figure 1 that frequent words (above 400 occurrences in the corpus) reach a 60% precision whereas rare words (below 15 occur-rences) are correctly aligned in only 5% of the time.
These results can be explained by the fact that, for the vector comparison to be efficient, the informa-tion they store has to be relevant and discriminatory. If there are not enough occurrences of a word, it is impossible to get a precise description of the typical context of this word, and therefore its description is likely to be very different for source and target words in translation.

We confirmed this result with another observa-tion on the full English part of the previous cor-pus, randomly split in 14 samples of the same size. The context-vectors for very frequent words, such as cancer (between 3,000 and 4,000 occurrences in each sample) are very similar across the subsets. Less frequent words, such as abnormality (between 70 and 16 occurrences in each sample) have very unstable context-vectors, hence a lower similarity across the subsets. This observation actually indi-cates that it will be difficult to align abnormality with itself. A pair of aligned comparable documents is a par-ticular case of comparable corpus: two compara-ble documents share the same topic and domain; they both relate the same information but are not mutual translations; although they might share par-allel chunks (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005)  X  para-graphs, sentences or phrases  X  in the general case they were written independently. These compara-ble documents, when concatenated together in order, form an aligned comparable corpus.
Examples of such aligned documents can be found, for example in (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005): they aligned comparable documents with close pub-lication dates. (Tao and Zhai, 2005) used an iter-ative, bootstrapping approach to align comparable documents using examples of already aligned cor-pora. (Smith et al., 2010) aligned documents from Wikipedia following the interlingual links provided on articles.

We take advantage of this alignment between doc-uments: by looking at what is common between two aligned documents and what is different in other documents , we obtain more precise informa-tion about terms than when using a larger compa-rable corpus without alignment. This is especially interesting in the case of rare lexicon as the clas-sic context-vector similarity is not discriminatory enough and fails at raising interesting translation for rare words. 4.1 Co-occurrence model Different approaches have been proposed for bilin-gual lexicon extraction from parallel corpora, rely-ing on the assumption that a word has one sense, one translation, no missing translation, and that its trans-lation appears in aligned parallel sentences (Fung, 2000). Therefore, translations can be extracted by comparing the distribution of words across the sen-tences. For example, (Gale and Church, 1991) used a derivative of the  X  2 statistics to evaluate the as-sociation between words in aligned region of paral-lel documents. Such association scores evaluate the strength of the relation between events. In the case of parallel sentences and lexicon extraction, they measure how often two words appear in aligned sen-tences, and how often one appears without the other. More precisely, they will compare their number of co-occurrences against the expected number of co-occurrences under the null-hypothesis that words are randomly distributed. If they appear together more often than expected, they are considered as associ-ated (Evert, 2008).

We focus in this work on rare words , more pre-cisely on specialized terminology. We define them as the set of terms that appear from 1 (hapaxes) to 5 times. We use a strategy similar to the one applied on parallel sentences, but rely on aligned documents . Our hypothesis is very similar: words in translation should appear in aligned comparable documents. We used the Jaccard similarity (eq. 1) to evaluate the association between words among aligned comparable documents. In the general case, this measure would not give relevant scores due to frequency issue: it produces the same scores for two words that appear always together, and never one without the other, disregarding the fact that they appear 500 times or one time only. Other associ-ation scores generally rely on occurrence and co-occurrence counts to tackle this issue (such as the log-likelihood, eq. 2). In our case, the number of co-occurrences will be limited by the number of oc-currences of the words, from 1 to 5. Therefore, the Jaccard similarity efficiently reflects what we want to observe.

A score of 1 indicates a perfect association (words always appear together, never one without the other), the more one word appears without the other, the lower the score. 4.2 Context-vector similarity We implemented the context-vector similarity in a way similar to (Morin et al., 2007). In all experi-ments, we used the same set of parameters, as they yielded the best results on our corpora. We built the context-vectors using nouns only as seed lexicon, with a window size of 20. Source context-vectors are translated in the target language using the re-sources presented in the next section. We used the log-likelihood (Dunning, 1993, eq. 2) for context-vector normalization ( O is the observed number of co-occurrence in the corpus, E is the expected num-ber of co-occurrences under the null hypothesis). We used the Cosine similarity (eq. 3) for context-vector comparisons. 4.3 Binary classification of rare translations We suggest to incorporate both the context-vector similarity and the co-occurrence features in a ma-chine learning approach. This approach consists of training a classifier on positive examples of transla-tion pairs, and negative examples of non-translations pairs. The trained model (in our case, a decision tree) is then used to tag an unknown pair of words as either  X  X ranslation X  or  X  X on-Translation X .

One potential problem for building the training set, as pointed out for example by (Zhao and Ng, 2007) is this: we have a limited number of pos-itive examples, but a very large amount of non-translation examples as obviously is the case for rare word translations in any training corpus. In-cluding two many negative examples in the training set would lead the classifier to label every pairs as  X  X on-Translation X .

To tackle this problem, (Zhao and Ng, 2007) tuned the imbalance of positive/negative ratio by re-sampling the positive examples in the training set. We chose to reduce the set of negative examples, and found that a ratio of five negative examples to one positive is optimal in our case. A lower ratio improves precision but reduces recall for the  X  X rans-lation X  class.

It is also desirable that the classifier focuses on discriminating between confusing pairs of transla-tions. As most of the negative examples have a null co-occurrence score and a null context-vector similarity, they are excluded from the training set. The negative examples are randomly chosen among those that fulfill the following constraints:  X  non-null features ;  X  ratio of number of occurrences between We use the J48 decision tree algorithm, in the Weka environment (Hall et al., 2009). Features are computed using the Jaccard similarity (section 3) for the co-occurrence model, and the implementa-tion of the context-vector similarity presented in sec-tion 4.2. 4.4 Extension to another pair of languages Even though the context vector similarity has been shown to achieve different accuracy depending on the pair of languages involved, the co-occurrence model is totally language independent. In the case of binary classification of translations, the two models are complementary to each other: word pairs with null co-occurrence are not considered by the context model while the context vector model gives more se-mantic information than the co-occurrence model.
For these reasons, we suggest that it is possible to use a decision tree trained on one pair of lan-guages to extract translations from another pair of languages. A similar approach is proposed in (Al-fonseca et al., 2008): they present a word decom-position model designed for German language that they successfully applied to other compounding lan-guages. Our approach consists in training a decision tree on a pair of languages and applying this model to the classification of unknown pairs of words in another pair of languages. Such an approach is es-pecially useful for prospecting new translations from less known languages, using a well known language as training.

We used the same algorithms and same features as in the previous sections, but used the data computed from one pair of languages as the training set, and the data computed from another pair of languages as the testing set. 5.1 Corpora We built several corpora using two different strate-gies. The first set was built using Wikipedia and the interlingual links available on articles (that points to another version of the same article in another language). We started from the list of all French vide a link to Spanish and English versions. We downloaded those, and clean them by removing the wikipedia formatting tags to obtain raw UTF8 texts. Articles were not selected based on their sizes, the vocabulary used, nor a particular topic. We obtained about 20,000 aligned documents for each language.
A second set was built using an in-house system (unpublished) that seeks for comparable and paral-lel documents from the web. Starting from a list of Chinese documents (in this case, mostly news arti-cles), we automatically selected English target docu-ments using Cross Language Information Retrieval. About 85% of the paired documents obtained are di-rect translations (header/footer of web pages apart). However, they will be processed just like aligned comparable documents, that is, we will not take ad-vantage of the structure of the parallel contents to improve accuracy, but will use the exact same ap-proach that we applied for the Wikipedia documents. We gathered about 15,000 pairs of documents em-ploying this method.
 for segmentation and Part-of-Speech tagging. We focused on nouns only and discarded all other to-kens. We would record the lemmatized form of tokens when available, otherwise we would record the original form. Table 1 summarizes main statis-tics for each corpus; [WP] refers to the Wikipedia corpora, [CLIR] to the Chinese-English corpora ex-tracted through cross language information retrieval. 5.2 Dictionaries We need a bilingual seed lexicon for the context-vector similarity. We used a French-English lex-icon obtained from the Web. It contains about 67,000 entries. The Spanish-English and Spanish-French dictionaries were extracted from the linguis-tic resources of the Apertium project 4 . We ob-tained approximately 22,500 Spanish-English trans-lations and 12,000 for Spanish-French. Finally, for Chinese-English we used the LDC2002L27 resource 122,000 entries. 5.3 Evaluation lists To evaluate our approach, we needed evaluation lists of terms for which translations are already known. We used the Medical Subject Headlines, from the specialized, medical terminology, notably in Span-ish, English and French. We used the LDC lexi-con presented in the previous section for Chinese-English.

From these resources, we selected all the source words that appears from 1 to 5 times in the corpora in order to build the evaluation lists. 5.4 Oracle translations We looked at the corpora to evaluate how many translation pairs from the evaluation lists can be found across the aligned comparable documents. Those translations are hereafter the oracle transla-tions . For French/English, French/Spanish and En-glish/Spanish, about 60% of the translation pairs can be found. For Chinese/English, this ratio reaches 45%. The main reason for this lower result is the inaccuracy of the segmentation tool used to process Chinese. Segmentation tools usually rely on a train-ing corpus and typically fail at handling rare words which, by definition, were unlikely to be found in the training examples. Therefore, some rare Chinese to-kens found in our corpus are the results of faulty seg-mentation, and the translation of those faulty words can not be found in related documents. We encoun-tered the same issue but at a much lower degree for other languages because of spelling mistakes and/or improper Part-of-Speech tagging. We ran three different experiments. Experiment I compares the accuracy of the context-vector sim-ilarity and the co-occurrence model. Experiment II uses supervised classification with both features. Experiment III extracts translation from a pair of languages, using a classifier trained on another pair of languages. 6.1 Experiment I: co-occurrence model vs. We split the French-English part of the Wikipedia corpus into different samples: the first sample con-tains 500 pairs of documents. We then aggregated more documents to this initial sample to test differ-ent sizes of corpora. We built the sample in order to ensure hapaxes in the whole corpus are hapaxes in all subsets. That is, we ensured the 431 hapaxes in the evaluation lists are represented in the 500 docu-ments subset.

We extracted translations in two different ways: 1. using the co-occurrence model; 2. using the context-vector based approach, with
The accuracy is computed on 1,000 pairs of trans-lations from the set of oracle translations, and mea-sures the amount of correct translations found for the 10 best ranks ( T op according to their score (context-vector similarity or co-occurrence model). The results are presented in figure 2.
 We can draw two conclusions out of these results. First, the size of the corpus influences the quality of the bilingual lexicon extraction when using the co-occurrence model. This is especially interesting with hapaxes, for which frequency does not change with the increase of the size of the corpora. The ac-curacy is improved by adding more information to the corpus, even if this additional information does not cover the pairs of translations we are looking for. The added documents will weaken the association of incorrect translations, without changing the as-sociation for rare terms translations. For example, the precision for hapaxes using the co-occurrence model ranges from less than 1% when using only 500 pairs of documents, to about 13% when using all documents. The second conclusion is that the co-occurrence model outperforms the context-vector similarity.

However, both these approaches still perform poorly. In the next experiment, we propose to com-bine them using supervised classification. 6.2 Experiment II: binary classification of For each corpus or combination of corpora  X  English-Spanish, English-French, Spanish-French and Chinese-English, we ran three experiments, us-ing the following features for supervised learning of translations:  X  the context-vector similarity;  X  the co-occurrence model;  X  both features together.

The parameters are discussed in section 4.3. We used all the oracle translations to train the positive values. Results are presented in table 2, they are computed using a 10-folds cross validation. Class T refers to  X  X ranslation X ,  X  T to  X  X on-Translation X . The evaluation of precision/recall/F-Measure for the class  X  X ranslation X  are given in equation 4 to 6.
These results show first that one feature is gen-erally not discriminatory enough to discern correct translation and non-translation pairs. For example with Spanish-English, by using context-vector sim-ilarity only, we obtained very high recall/precision for the classification of  X  X on-Translation X , but null precision/recall for the classification of  X  X ransla-tion X . In some other cases, we obtained high pre-cision but poor recall with one feature only, which is not a usefully result as well since most of the correct translations are still labeled as  X  X on-Translation X .
However, when using both features, the precision is strongly improved up to 98% (English-Spanish or French-Spanish) with a high recall of about 90% for class T. We also achieved about 86%/75% pre-cision/recall in the case of Chinese-English, even though they are very distant languages. This last re-sult is also very promising since it has been obtained from a fully automatically built corpus. Table 3 shows some examples of correctly labeled  X  X rans-lation X .

The decision trees obtained indicate that, in gen-eral, word pairs with very high co-occurrence model scores are translations, and that the context-vector similarity disambiguate candidates with lower co-occurrence model scores. Interestingly, the trained decision trees are very similar between the different pairs of languages, which inspired the next experi-ment. 6.3 Experiment III: extension to another pair In the last experiment, we focused on using the knowledge acquired with a given pair of languages to recognize proper translation pairs using a dif-ferent pair of languages. For this experiment, we used the data from one corpus to train the classifier, and used the data from another combination of lan-guages as the test set. Results are displayed in ta-ble 4.

These last results are of great interest because they show that translation pairs can be correctly classified even with a classifier trained on another pair of languages. This is very promising be-cause it allows one to prospect new languages using knowledge acquired on a known pairs of languages. As an example, we reached a 77% F-Measure for Chinese-English alignment using a classifier trained on Spanish-French features. This not only confirms the precision/recall of our approach in general, but also shows that the model obtained by training tends to be very stable and accurate across different pairs of languages and different corpora. Tested with We presented a new approach for extracting transla-tions of rare words among aligned comparable doc-uments. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first high accuracy extraction of rare lexi-con from non-parallel documents. We obtained a F-Measure ranging from about 80% (French-English, Chinese-English) to 97% (French-Spanish). We also obtained good results for extracting lexicon for a pair of languages, using a decision tree trained with the data computed on another pair of languages. We yielded a 77% F-Measure for the extraction of Chinese-English lexicon, using Spanish-French for training the model.

On top of these promising results, our approach presents several other advantages. First, we showed that it works well on automatically built corpora which require minimal human intervention. Aligned comparable documents can easily be collected and are available in large volumes. Moreover, the pro-posed machine learning method incorporating both context-vector and co-occurrence model has shown to give good results on pairs of languages that are very different from each other, such as Chinese-English. It is also applicable across different train-ing and testing language pairs, making it possible for us to find rare word translations even for lan-guages without training data. The co-occurrence model is completely language independent and have been shown to give good results on various pairs of languages, including Chinese-English.
