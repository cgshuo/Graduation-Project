 the Section 5. 2. Theoretical background
In this section, we present the basic concepts used throughout the paper. 2.1. Functional dependencies
Let A = { a of tuples { t dom ( X ) , such that X  X  X  and t [ X ] denotes the restriction of the tuple t to X . by F r the set of all functional dependencies satis fi ed by r . and E , respectively.
 ( t and G| = F .
 { X  X  A | X  X  X  ,A  X  X  ,r | = X  X  A, X  X  A is minimal } .
 2.2. Hypergraph theory theory. For more theoretical issues the reader is referred to [4].
A hypergraph H is an ordered pair H =( V , E ) of a fi nite set V = { V E = { E  X  E j  X  X  such that E j  X  E i } .
 { AB,BDE,BE,ABCD } . Then, H is not simple since AB  X  ABCD . Min ( H )= { AB, BE } . of H as hyperedges.
 Lemma 1. Tr ( H )= Tr ( Min ( H )) .
 Lemma 2. Tr ( E i )= {{ e }|{ e } X  E i } .
 Lemma 3. Let H =( V , E ) be a hypergraph such that E = { E sequence T T j = Tr ( { E 1 ,...,E j } ) ,j  X  [0 ...m ] . Thus, T m = Tr ( H ) . Example 3. Let H =( V , E ) be a hypergraphsuch that E = { AB, BCD } . T T be of use to mine FDs in evolving databases. 3. Incremental updating of functional dependencies I augmenting it with t : 3.1.

They are equal to: { t induced by the tuple t Ag ( t 7 ,t 2 )= DE because t 2 belongs to r ( D ) t 7 and r ( E ) t 7 Ag ( t 7 ,t 3 )= AD because t 3 belongs to r ( A ) t 7 and r ( D ) t 7 . Ag ( t 7 ,t 4 )= ADE because t 4 belongs to r ( A ) t 7 ,r ( D ) t 7 and r ( E ) t 7 . Ag ( t 7 ,t 5 )= C because t 5 belongs to r ( C ) t 7 .
 Consequently, Ag ( r ) t ( r  X  t ).

After computing the agree sets induced by t FDs by pruning those having D as consequent. 3.1.2.2. A second level of re fi nement based on agree generators induced by t induced by t . Formally, agree generators induced by t are de fi ned as follows. tuples and we will insert tuple t the agree sets induced by t generators induced by t For ACDE, ( ACDE Cover For CDE, ( CDE Cover Consequently, Gen ( r ) t t , we can determine the set of FDs which will be violated after the insertion of t . set of the candidate violated FDs of Cover ( F r ) are:

Cover ( F r ) is violated by ( r  X  t ) means that:  X  r | = X  X  A :  X  Y  X  Ag ( r ) such that X  X  YandA  X  Y . conditions. Suppose that Z  X  A is the new FD obtained after maintaining X  X  A : 1. Z should not be included in any agree set of Ag ( r ) that does not contain A . 3. Z  X  A has to be minimal since it belongs to Cover ( F r  X  t ) . computing minimal transversals of a hypergraph.

 H = ( A , { Ag  X  m ,..., Ag to Proposition 1, Z is a minimal transversal of Min ( H ) = ( A , { MAg  X  m ,..., MAg are the transversal hypergraph obtained when MAg  X  m ,..., MAg considered. It is obvious that X  X  L sets of Ag ( r ) A ) . Hence, in order to update X  X  A , we have to restrict L compute incrementally Tr ( G ) where G = ( A , { MG L tuples and we will insert the tuple t
After computing the agree sets induced by t identi fi cation of the agree generators induced by t this set, we can deduce FDs which will be violated after the insertion of t C, C  X  D, E  X  DandC  X  E will be violated. Let us maintain C  X  E . The maximal agree generators induced by t L an antecedent obtained by considering maximal agree generators induced by tMG by t . We distinguish two cases:  X  If Y is a minimal transversal of MG i included in Y .

After, we check whether Cover ( F r ) could be the canonical cover of ( r  X  t minimal FDs of Cover ( F r ) are candidate to be violated by ( r  X  t we apply a fi rst re fi nement based on the agree sets induced by t classes of r with respect to t attribute. Indeed, MC ( r ) t to r ( C ) t r ( belongs only to r ( E ) t a consequent included in all agree sets induced by t level of re fi nement does not prune any minimal FD.
