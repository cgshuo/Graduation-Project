A proposal for a T y pe I I D emo 1 .1 T he segmentation of w ords into O ne of the fu ndamental task s in natu ral lang u ag e processing applications, su ch as larg e-vocab u lary speech recog nition ( L V CS R) , statistical machine translation ( S M T ) and information retrieval ( IR) , is the morpholog ical analy sis of w ords. It is par-ticu larly important for the morpholog ically com-plex lang u ag es, w here the amou nt of different w ord forms is su b stantially increased b y in ection, derivation and composition. T he decomposition of w ords is req u ired not only for u nderstanding the sen-tence, b u t in many lang u ag es also for ju st represent-ing the lang u ag e b y any tractab le and trainab le sta-tistical model and lex icon. T he manu ally composed ru le-b ased morpholog ical analy z ers can solve these prob lems to some ex tent, b u t only a fraction of the ex isting lang u ag es have b een covered so far, and for many the coverag e of the relevant content is insu f -cient.

T he ob jective of the M orpho Challeng e 1 is to de-sig n and evalu ate new u nsu pervised statistical ma-chine learning alg orithms that discover w hich mor-phemes ( smallest individu ally meaning fu l u nits of lang u ag e) w ords consist of. T he g oal is to discover b asic vocab u lary u nits su itab le for different task s, su ch as L V CS R, S M T and IR. In u nsu pervised learn-ing the list of morphemes is not pre-speci ed for each lang u ag e, b u t the optimal morpheme lex icon and morpheme analy sis of all different w ord forms is statistically optimiz ed from a larg e tex t corpu s in a completely data-driven manner.

T he evalu ation of the morpheme analy sis alg o-rithms is performed b oth b y a ling u istic and an ap-plication oriented task . T he analy sis ob tained for a long list of w ords is rst compared to the lin-g u istic g old standard representing a g rammatically correct analy sis b y verify ing that the morpheme-sharing w ord pairs are the correct ones ( K u rimo et al., 2 0 0 7 ) . T his is repeated in different lang u ag es and then the ob tained decomposition of w ords is applied in state-of-the-art sy stems ru nning variou s NLP applications. The suitability of the morphemes is v eri ed by comparing the performance of the sys-tems to each other and to systems using unprocessed w ord s or conv entional w ord processing alg orithms lik e stemming or rule-based d ecompositions.

A s a baseline method in all application, w e hav e built systems by applying the M orfessor alg orithm, w hich is an unsuperv ised w ord d ecomposition alg o-rithm d ev eloped at our research g roup ( C reutz and Lag us, 20 0 2) and released as open source softw are implementation 2 . 1.2 Morphemes in Information Retrieval I n information retriev al ( I R ) from tex t d ocuments a typical task is to look for the most relev ant d ocu-ments for a g iv en q uery. O ne of the k ey challeng es is to red uce all the in ected w ord forms to a common root or stem for effectiv e ind ex ing . F rom the mor-pheme analysis point of v iew this task is to d ecom-pose all the w ord s in the q uery and tex t d ocuments and nd out those common morphemes w hich form the most relev ant link s.

I n M orpho C halleng e the I R systems built using the unsuperv ised morpheme analysis alg orithms are compared in state-of-the-art C LE F task s in F innish, G erman and E ng lish ( K urimo and Turunen, 20 0 8 ) using the mean av erag e precision metric. The results are also compared to those obtained by the g rammat-ical morphemes as w ell as the stemming and w ord normaliz ation method s conv entionally used in I R . 1.3 Morphemes in S peec h Rec og nition I n larg e-v ocabulary continuous speech recog nition ( LV C S R ) one k ey part of the process is the statis-tical lang uag e mod eling w hich d etermines the prior probabilities of all the possible w ord seq uences. A n especially challeng ing task is to cov er all the pos-sible w ord forms w ith suf cient accuracy, because any out-of-v ocabulary w ord s w ill not only be nev er correctly recog niz ed , but also sev erely d eg rad e the mod eling of the other nearby w ord s. B y d ecompos-ing the w ord s into meaning ful sub-w ord units, such as morphemes, larg e-v ocabulary lang uag e mod els can be successfully built ev en for the most d if cult ag g lutinativ e lang uag es, lik e F innish, E stonian and Turk ish ( K urimo et al., 20 0 6 b) .
I n M orpho C halleng e the unsuperv ised mor-pheme alg orithms hav e been compared by using the morphemes to train statistical lang uag e mod els and applying the mod els in state-of-the-art LV C S R task s in F innish and Turk ish ( K urimo et al., 20 0 6 a) . B enchmark s for the same task s w ere obtained by mod els that utiliz e the g rammatical morphemes as w ell as trad itional w ord -based lang uag e mod els. 1.4 Morphemes in Mac hine T ranslation The state-of-the-art statistical machine translation ( S M T) systems are affected by the morpholog ical v ariation of w ord s at tw o d ifferent stag es ( V irpi-oja et al., 20 0 7 ) . I n the rst stag e, the alig nment of the source and targ et lang uag e w ord s in a par-allel training corpus and the training of the transla-tion mod el can bene t from the d ecomposition of complex w ord s into morphemes. This is particularly important w hen either the targ et or the source lan-g uag e, or both, are morpholog ically complex . The nal stag e w here the targ et lang uag e tex t is g ener-ated , may also req uire morpheme-based mod els, be-cause the larg e-v ocabulary statistical lang uag e mod -els are applied in the same w ay as in LV C S R .
I n the on-g oing M orpho C halleng e 20 0 9 compe-tition, the morpheme analysis alg orithms are com-pared in S M T task s, w here the analysis is need ed for the source lang uag e tex ts. The E uropean Par-liament parallel corpus ( K oehn, 20 0 5 ) is used in the ev aluation. The source lang uag es are F innish and G erman and the targ et in both task s is E ng lish. To obtain a state-of-the-art performance in the task s the morpheme-based S M T w ill be combined w ith a w ord -based S M T using the M inimum B ayes R isk ( M B R ) interpolation of the N-best translation hy-pothesis of both systems ( d e G ispert et al., 20 0 9 ) . 1.5 Morpho C halleng e 20 0 9 A s its pred ecessors, the M orpho C halleng e 20 0 9 competition is open to all and free of charg e. The participants' are ex pected to use their unsuperv ised machine learning alg orithms to analyz e the w ord lists of d ifferent lang uag es prov id ed by the org aniz -ers and submit the results of their morpheme analy-sis. The org aniz ers w ill then run the ling uistic ev al-uations and build the I R and S M T systems and pro-v id e all the results and comparisons of the d ifferent systems. The participated alg orithms and ev aluation results will be presented at the Morpho Challenge work shop that is c urrently planned to tak e plac e within the H L T -N A A CL 2 0 1 0 c onf erenc e. T he Morpho Challenge c om petitions and work shops are part of the E U N etwork of E x c ellenc e P A S CA L Challenge program and organiz ed in c ollaboration with CL E F .
