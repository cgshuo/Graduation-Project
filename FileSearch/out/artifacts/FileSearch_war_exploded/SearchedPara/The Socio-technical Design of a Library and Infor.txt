 The aim of this research is to design a collaboratory that is a socio-technical platform to support sh aring research data collection instruments in a social science disc ipline, in particular library and information science. A socio-tec hnical approach to design that includes a literature review, an empirical study and use cases, are used to create specifications for a collaboratory prototype. Future work includes an evaluation of the collaboratory prototype.

Socio-technical design; collaboratories; information sharing; use cases; data collection instruments, prototypes This research focuses on the socio-technical design of a collaboratory to support research a nd practice in a social science discipline, in particular in libra ry and information science (LIS). Collaboration across distances and institutions increasingly facilitates advances in research and practice. A collaboratory, also called a virtual research environment, is  X  a network-based facility and organizational entity that spans distance, supports rich and recurring human interaction oriented to a common research area, fosters contact between rese archers who are both known and unknown to each other, and provides access to data sources, artifacts and tools required to accomplish research tasks  X  [8]. In contrast to digital repositories, collaboratories have a social dimension, linking shared resour ces with research and social practices prevalent in its community. The purpose of the collaboratory we are designing is to help LIS researchers, students and professionals share research data collection instruments. We be lieve sharing data collection instruments may improve the quality and breadth of research in the discipline, encourage students to replicate previous studies in meaningful ways, and reduce the time needed to conduct research. The challenge is achieving this in a high context, social science discipline that is inter-disciplinary in nature and collaboration (as evidenced by co-authorship) lags behind other disciplines [2]. Socio-technical design features for the collaboratory emerged from a review of relevant research literature [6] and an empirical study in which LIS researchers, students a nd professionals were interviewed to discover needs, opportunities, and barriers for sharing data collection instruments in our disc ipline. The socio-technical design features strive to: promote re-use of all types of data collection instruments; provide rewards for contributing to the collaboratory; encourage discussion among member s; be accessible to students, professionals and researchers globa lly; protect members' intellectual property; and, facilitate learning about research methods and data collection instruments. The design of the prototype collaboratory emerged from two empirical study with LIS students, academic faculty members and professionals. The results from thes e activities were aggregated into use cases that highlight potential ways individuals could interact with the collaboratory to facilitate their research. In the literature review, a synthesis of literature from the areas of scientific collaboration, scholar ly communication, scientific disciplines, invisible colleges, and virtual communities was conducted. The result of the synthesis is a taxonomy [6] that provides a concise overview of explanatory factors concerning adoption and use of collaboratories. The taxonomy includes six types of factors which appear to impact the design and use of a scientific collaboratory. These are factors related to: the progress of science (including career as well as disciplinary and scientific development factors); social asp ects of science (including personal and community factors); and economic aspects of science (including cost of participation and cost to develop and sustain factors). The empirical study investigated the needs, opportunities and barriers for sharing digital data collection instruments from the perspective of the target user community, i.e., the LIS community. Purposeful sampling was employed to ensure a broad range of experience and expertise among the study participants. A total of sixteen interviews were conducted with information professionals, master students, Ph.D. students, academic faculty members, and senior academic faculty members. Each participant had different research experiences and expertise regarding data collection techniques. The interview data we re analyzed using open and axial coding. Six themes emerged from the coding. These themes are: access to research instruments; rewards for contributing; ensuring quality; social network; time and effort; and sustaining a collaboratory. Based on the themes emerging from the interview study, and factors that were identified in the synthesi s of relevant research literature, requirements for a prototype LIS collaboratory were generated and documented in use cases. Use cases are used to discover and refine design requirements during the softwa re design process [1]. Daniels and Bahill [3] describe the rela tion between design requirements and use cases as requirements being " embedded within the use case X  X  textual description, maki ng use cases a container for the requirements " [3] A prototype collaboratory is under development using the MediaWiki (http://mediawiki.org) software wiki package. MediaWiki is run on a server and uses a MySQL database for data storage [5]. Communication with the server for handling processes and displaying data in different wa ys is handled by PHP [7]. The prototype can be used with most web browsers and does not require any equipment other than an Internet connection. It can be accessed from any geographic location in the world. This is in line with lessons learned from collaboratorie s in other disciplines, which indicate that a flexible system that does not require any special equipment, hardware, operative syst ems or other software are more likely to be used [4]. The prototype collaboratory requires members to create an account and to log on to the collaboratory in order to use it for any purpose. Sharing and finding data collection instruments are in focus on the main page. Boxes listing the latest uploads, most downloaded, and latest comments on instruments are displayed to members when they login, with the intent of sp arking interest in new instruments, encouraging discussions, and motivating members to log on frequently. In the prototype members of the collaboratory are able to upload and annotate data collection instru ments, such as questionnaires, interview protocols and web log an alysis software. Annotation is accomplished via a wiki page which allows creators to describe their data collection instruments in deta il, and allows for other members to pose questions and comment on th e data collection instruments. Members are able to search for data collection instruments using a standard MediaWiki search feature and by browsing and searching a discipline-specific thesaurus. To facilitate communication between members of the prototype collaboratory, features such as personal profiles for members, and possib ilities to discuss, pose questions about, and comment on individua l instruments are being implemented. Boxes listing the la test uploads, most downloaded, and latest comments on instruments will be displayed to members when they login, with the intent of sparking interest in new instruments, encouraging discu ssions, and motivating members to log on frequently. Further work includes developi ng additional use cases and an evaluation study of the prototype collaboratory. Use cases specific to different categories of actors will be created, which is supported by our empirical study and related research (e.g., [4, 9]) that suggest that creating use cases for different types of actors would enhance human-system interaction. Examples of such specialized use cases include: an information professional searching for a data collection instrument to use when planning to conduct a patron survey; and a professor searching for data collection instruments to include in a course on research methods. In th e case of the patron survey, the information professional may fo cus on finding a data collection instrument used in a specific type of library. In the case of teaching research methods, the professor may focus on finding several data collection instruments that can be critiqued and compared based on their having a common research topic. Future work also includes evaluating the prototype collaboratory. Plans include to asking LIS students, academic faculty members and other researchers, and professiona ls to perform tasks using the collaboratory while talking aloud. Examples of possible tasks include submitting a data collection instrument to the collaboratory; and finding a relevant data collection instrument in the collaboratory. After each think aloud session an interview will be conducted to capture any additional information that the study participants might wish to add to their experiences of completing the tasks.
