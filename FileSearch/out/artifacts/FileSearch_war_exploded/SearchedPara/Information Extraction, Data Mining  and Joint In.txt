 Although information extraction and data mining appear together in many applications, their interface in most current systems would better be described as serial juxtaposition than as tight integration. Information extraction populates slots in a database by identifying releva nt subsequences of text, but is usually not aware of the emerging patterns and regularities in the database. Data mining methods begin from a populated database, and are often unaware of where the data came from, or its inherent uncertainties. The result is that the accuracy of both suffers, and accurate mining of complex text sources has been beyond reach. In this talk I will describe work in probabilistic models that perform joint inference acro ss multiple components of an information processing pipeline in order to avoid the brittle accumulation of errors. After briefly introducing conditional random fields, I will describe recent work in information extraction leveraging factorial state representations, entity resolution, and transfer learning, as well as scalable methods of inference and learning. I' ll close with some recent work on probabilistic models for social network analysis, and a demonstration of Rexa.info, a new research paper search engine. This is joint work with colleagues at University of Massachusetts: Charles Sutton, Chris Pal, Ben Wellner, Michael Hay, Xuerui Wang, Natasha Mohanty, and Andres Corrada. Andrew McCallum is an Associat e Professor at University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He was previously Vice President of Research and Development at WhizBang Labs, a company that used machin e learning for information extraction from the Web. In the late 1990's he was a Research Scientist and Coordinator at Justsystem Pittsburgh Research Center, where he spearheaded the creation of CORA, an early research pape r search engine that used machine learning for spidering, extraction, classification and citation analysis. After receiving his PhD from the University of Rochester in 1995, he was a post-doctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon University. He is an action editor for the Journal of Machine Lear ning Research. For the past ten years, McCallum has been ac tive in research on statistical machine learning applied to text, especially information extraction, document classification, clustering, finite state models, semi-supervised learning, and social network analysis.
