 In this paper, we describe what we believe to be the char-acteristics of the collaborations required in the domain of critical infrastructure modeling, based on our experiences to date. We adopt a knowledge management philosophy, which imposes two classes of requirements, contextual ( who , when , and why ), and semantic ( what interactions are conducted around). We observe that infrastructure models can often engender more insight when used as the basis for a meaning-ful discussion between the disparate stakeholder groups (pri-vate industry, trade organizations, industry lobbying groups, etc.) than when exercised computationally.

Critical Infrastructures are the interdependent technolog-ical structures and systems that support the operation of society, such as telecommunications, transportation, energy transmission and transformation, water and wastewater, and also related social, political, emergency planning and re-sponse and economic systems. The National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC) provides analysis services addressing the impact of potential events (natural or man-made disasters, policy proposals, mitigation strate-gies) on these highly complex, interrelated systems. Typical NISAC questions are aspecific, open-ended, and vague, and the time frames for providing a response range from hours  X  Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company for the United States Department of Energy X  X  National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.
 to months. Executive orders have defined 14 critical infras-tructure categories which range from postal and shipping in-frastructure to various classes of energy infrastructure (i.e. electrical power grid, petroleum distribution network, etc.); it is impossible for any one person to have sufficient exper-tise across this spectrum to answer the kinds of questions asked with a suitable degree of accuracy.

The information needed to address cross-infrastructure is-sues is also partitioned across various organizations. Ap-proximately 85% of critical infrastructure in the U.S. is pri-vately owned, and many of the aspects characterizing in-frastructures as critical are based on economic activity in private industry. Infrastructure operators, business own-ers, and other members of the private sector possess the de-tailed data describing the current operating state of the sys-tem needed to ground domain knowledge in reality. NISAC depends heavily on collaboration with infrastructure sector experts at the national, regional, and local levels for access to this data and information about infrastructure processes and operations.

The vision for NISAC is to address the domain knowl-edge problem by building collaborative ventures with this diverse group of public and private entities, amalgamating widely geographically and organizationally distributed in-frastructure expertise. We propose to apply the best prac-tices of knowledge management to these interactions, so that we capture, persist, and reflect on the nature and extent of the collaborations which occur through the framework. This focus drives two classes of requirements, contextual requirements capturing dimensions of who , when , and why interactions occur, and semantic requirements identifying what interactions are conducted around. Each requirement class is addressed in a section below.
The key advantages of computationally-mediated collab-orative communication systems in supporting asynchronous communication and automatic archival still apply when viewed through a knowledge-management perspective. Asynchronous communication also lowers the cost of maintaining intersub-jectivity, the explicitly shared comprehension of communi-cated concepts such as common meanings and metaphors. If collaboration is not tied to real time, the group X  X  common understanding is not bound by the lowest common denom-inator -participants who don X  X  yet grasp a shared concept have the latitude to research the meaning of the terms de-scribing the concept without derailing the group dynamic. In other words, persistence, in proper form, allows later di-gestion and retrospective commentary by individuals that can significantly enhance the value of the group X  X  knowl-edge. We argue, however, that synchronous mechanisms, where the on-line subgroup of the overall community is in-teracting in real-time, are necessary for individual interpre-tations, understanding, and insights build upon one another to form cogent findings and conclusions under the very real time constraints of the problem domain. Synchronous com-munication is desirable because it enforces participation in a community, similar to the organizational behavior of  X  X alling a meeting X  but without the colocation requirements. This is particularly significant for domain experts, who are typically highly valued for, and therefore have a number of demands on, their time. Synchronicity increases the stridence of a collaborative contribution, and for efforts where the collab-orative goal is a higher priority goal than other tasks this can be beneficial at maximizing input.

We feel the KM perspective does derogate the suggested benefit of anonymous communication in collaboration. Al-though limited visibility of an individual X  X  identity may be important for social/psychological factors encouraging pub-lic admission of limited knowledge or a lack of understand-ing, from a knowledge management perspective there is tremen-dous value in associating contextual information about an individual with the shared contributions that person makes. Rich meta data is needed about participants, including their educational background and disciplinary viewpoint, their experience level, their familiarity with domain, their or-ganizational affiliation. In addition, the archival system needs to capture when questions are raised, both in terms of calendar time, and in the broader qualitative context of the stage of the analysis process unfolding during the col-laboration (i.e. is the collaboration in an expanding pos-sibilities/brainstorming phase; a narrowing/focusing down phase; an analytic or computational phase; in literature or background searching; or otherwise synthesizing or catego-rizing data; etc.) The objective is to create information that can later be mined to understand: who is asking the ques-tions and who is answering them; when are questions raised; and why questions arise, in terms of what activities are being undertaken at that time.

This suggests that although identity and  X  X lectronic per-sona X  information may have limited visibility to the human participants in the collaboration, depending on the context of the information exchange, it needs to have global sys-tem/internal visibility for later knowledge extraction and processing. One goal of this data mining is to identify if certain classes of simulation results are triggers for ques-tions concerning authenticity in order to create best prac-tices for vetting simulation models before their results are presented as meaningful. Another goal is to allow later iden-tification of experts (those with knowledge) so their views and commentary can be treated differently in various ways (extracted and compiled, searched, weighted more heavily, etc.) Group dynamics as a function of individual character-istics will also be investigated -what composition of indi-viduals experienced the most synergistic collective problem solving? What was the composition of groups that did not prove effective at problem solving?
One question not included in the list above is what ques-tions were asked, and what answers were given. Collab-oration involves sharing both data and knowledge about the data. While the latter will typically be highly unstruc-tured, it is possible to capture a great deal of rich machine-processable information about data which are shared. Again, the end goal is to enable a knowledge extraction process to answer questions such as: What areas do experts drill into? What data do they use to verify a model presents results that match their experience? Are there commonalities in what data are looked at or looked for? What are the char-acteristics and distinguishing features of these data?
The programmatic means to achieve this end may in itself be worthwhile from a collaboration framework perspective -if the framework explicitly represents rich semantics in all data transfers across it, tremendous opportunities exist for software developers to automate various data-centric tasks, such as transforming exchanged data or merging new data with existing information. For example, many researchers have suggested the creation of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) lists as a tool to aid a collaborative community, which are of course, inherently task-based ( X  X ow do I ...? X ). Semantically explicit data structures would allow the for-mation of Frequently Observed Objects (FOO) lists ( X  X ho else was concerned about fixed-price options? X ) which may cross-cut task-based hierarchies of system functionality.
NISAC naturally depends heavily on collaboration with disparate national, regional, and local stakeholder groups for the operational data and process information necessary to create accurate and complete models, simulations, and analyses. Collaboration is also fundamental, however, to the subsequent continuous refinement of the decision sup-port advice that can be extracted from the simulation(s). The tremendous intrinsic value of collaboration between the development environment of the laboratories and the hetero-geneous stakeholder  X  X se X  environment, however, has been diminished by the transitory and ephemeral nature of the exchange of technical and conceptual knowledge in  X  X eal-world X  meetings and workshops. This paper argues for con-ducting this synchronous collaboration in the digital domain to enable both subsequent asynchronous evolution of shared knowledge artifacts and traditional Knowledge Management access. The extent and nature of knowledge engineering queries is probably limitless, but here we have proposed a few examples, such as  X  X ho, exactly, is asking what ques-tions, and can we figure out why? Do those questions in-dicate areas where the model needs to be improved? Are there issues the simulation needs to inform the model oper-ator/exercisor about better?
