 Serendipitously discovering new information can bring many benefits. Although we can design systems to highlight serendip-itous information, serendipity cannot be easily orchestrated and is thus hard to study. In this paper, we deployed a working search engine that matched search results with Face-book  X  X ike X  data, as a technology probe to examine naturally occurring serendipitous discoveries. Search logs and diary entries revealed the nature of these occasions in both leisure and work contexts. The findings support the use of the micro-serendipity model in search system design.

Serendipity is a naturally occurring phenomenon in our daily life, and has been proven to be valuable in many do-mains, including: medicine [18], business [8], creative think-ing [2], as well as simply discovering new songs, good movies, or even useful literature in a library. Fine &amp; Deegan [12] proposed the definition of serendipity as  X  X he unique and contingent mix of insight coupled with chance X  , which sums prior definitions by saying that a successful serendipitous encounter requires both a prepared mind and an accidental occurrence, to create a new insight.

To deliberately support serendipitous discoveries, research has tried to deconstruct serendipity and identify design op-portunities [1]. In this project, we suggest that user interests, gathered from social media profiles, can be used in web search to facilitate serendipity: 1) users might select partially rel-evant or less directly relevant search results, when seeing an unexpected event occurs, and 3) a connection leads to a fortuitous outcome.

Makri &amp; Blandford [16] focused on the stages of connection, realisation, and reflection that lead people to retrospectively consider an event serendipitous. They also highlight that most serendipitous events lead to a macro -serendipity tangi-ble benefit, but that outcomes may also simply be an advance-ment of knowledge or understanding. Bogers &amp; Bjorneborn further focused on these as micro-serendipity events, which were valuable even without clear tangible outcomes [5].
Andre et al [2] found that serendipity happens in web search, where interesting and both partially relevant or completely irrelevant search results have the potential for serendipity. Letizia [14], a browser agent, analysed web histories to recommend potentially interesting items to the user, but aimed to recommend interesting pages rather than highlight serendipity during normal web search. Similarly, a system called Max [7] sent recommendations to users via email after analysing two months of browsing data. Evalua-tions revealed that of 100 recommendations, 7 were found to be valuable by users. Mitsikeru [4] did try to highlight serendipitous results during search, but was not studied.
As serendipity cannot be simulated within a lab study, we chose, like others [2], to use investigative methods to explore naturally occuring examples of serendipity. Unlike prior work, however, we built a custom working search en-gine, Feegli, which uses real social media data to highlight results from normal searches that might also relate to one of their interests. As found with the design of PIM tasks [10], the individual nature of serendipity requires the use of real personal data. This personal nature of serendipity, however, precludes the creation of a comparable control group. Feegli, as a technology probe, however, allowed us to study natu-rally occurring serendipitous occasions, using event logs and insights from a longditudinal diary study. Feegli was built using the Google Custom Search REST API, and extracted interest data, as JSON files, from the Facebook Graph API v1.0, as soon as they signed up using their Facebook account. Further, participants added addi-tional interests within a settings page for the Feegli system. When users issued a query, the titles and snippets of the search results were matched against the recorded Like data, as exact strings and whole words. Partial matches were not highlighted to avoid matches like  X  X ha IR 0 . Unlike typical personalisation systems, we did not re-rank results based on these interests. Instead, we highlighted results, leverag-ing the Restorff Isolation Effect [22] to provide a secondary notion of potential relevance to ranking.

Several indicators of interest-relevance were considered during the design phase: 1) interest matched, 2) intensity of match, and 3) source of interest. After discussing several al-ternatives for such indicators during focus groups, the last of these was not included in the design: social media icons were presumed to be for sharing results on social networks, and listing the source network provided less value than including more results before the fold.

Matched interests were highlighted in place, with a yellow background as seen in Figure 1, rather than being listed separately. For intensity of match, we chose to indicate and so on. The daily diary was manually constructed by the experimenter to include the daily examples, and sent to the participants as a word document via email. Diary entries were returned in the same way.
Each participant used Feegli as their primary search engine between 25th April to 4th May, 2014. During these 11 days, participants made 506 queries in total (avg. 46 queries per day). Feegli returned 5380 search results during the study. Of these, Feegli highlighted 445 (8%) to be potentially serendipitous. Of these, 57 were clicked on by participants. From the immediate popup feedback, 35.1% were chosen because the text snippet made them seem relevant and 26.6% because the link was the top result. 17.5% of results were clicked because the user was specifically looking for the link. 22.8%, however, were clicked because Feegli highlighted them.
Commonly there are three types of queries people make in search engines: Navigational (to get to a certain website), Transactional (e.g. to buy, download, or retrieve something) and Informational (to resolve an information need) [6]. 84% of the queries were classified as informational; navigational and transactional counted for 8% each. Of the 445 highlighted results, 96% were shown for informational queries, and 4% for navigational queries. Using proportion of queries as an expected ratio, a chi-squared analysis showed that highlights were significantly more likely to be shown for informational queries (  X  2 (2) = 49 . 826 ,p &lt; 0 . 0001). Of the 57 highlighted results clicked on by users, 98% were for informational queries. Using proportion of highlights shown as an estimated ratio, a chi-squared analysis showed that this was not significantly more than would be expected. All of the occasions where a user indicated that they clicked on the highlighted result because of the potentially serendipitous content were from these informational queries.

We also analysed the likely work or leisure focus of the queries. 52% were related to work and 40% of the queries are related to leisure search; 8% could not be easily classified. 64% of the highlighted, potentially serendipitous, results were shown for work queries, while only 34% were for social. Using proportion of classifiable queries submitted as an esti-mated ratio, a chi-squared analysis showed that significantly more highlights were shown for work-oriented queries than expected (  X  2 (1) = 11 . 352 ,p &lt; 0 . 001). Of the 57 actually clicked, 60% were for work queries, while the remaining 40% were for leisure queries. Using proportion of highlights shown as an estimated ratio, a chi-squared analysis showed that highlights were not significantly more likely to be clicked in either work or leisure searches. The clicks that users said were because of the potentially serendipitous highlight were present in both groups. Perhaps surprisingly, these results indicate that there is opportunity and reason to support serendipitous discoveries in focused work tasks too, as well as when more casually searching.
Diary entires confirmed that users did experience serendip-ity while using Feegli, primarily for informational needs, but also for both leisure and work searches.
Following a recommendation, Feegli helped P3 to stumble upon unexpected link and later helped to find serendipitous is that people who inserted more data in the profile, and had more Facebook Likes, received more serendipitous results than others. Future work may wish to examine optimal levels of interest modeling to support serendipity.
Our study data loosely supports both main perspectives on serendipity: the unexpected encounter [17], and the purpose-ful awareness of cues [20]. In both cases, however, there was element of  X  X urprise X  in the process and also there was pres-ence of  X  X nsight X  where user made the connection [16]. More notably, however, it is evident that some of the serendipitous events helped our participants in some less outcome-oriented ways, but still described as valuable to them. These findings further support the focus on occasions of micro-serendipity [5], which were notably present in participants X  diary entries.
Several key recommendations for designing systems can be drawn from our exploratory investigation: 1) evidence suggests that the model of microserendipity is worth following in design, 2) rich interest profiles are likely to highlight more potentially serendipitous results, 3) capturing work  X  X nterests X  may be equally as important as everyday interests, and 4) serendipitous design may be better if focused towards informational queries.

Future work may wish to focus on the influence of different design decisions on these encounters, or by integrating other sources of interest data. Unfortunately, we were not able to compare a range of possible user interface designs in our study (e.g. like [19]). Systems like Google, however, have a notable potential to examine this issue by combining topical content from +1 data, rather than specific pages, with search results. Likewise, Bing could examine this issue using their integration with Facebook. Further, Feegli used only a relatively simple technique to model and match user interests, and so much smarter methods, including those used in prior work, could be used to examine more design opportunities.
To investigate naturally occurring serendipity in web search a technology-probe search engine, Feegli, was deployed that highlighted Google API search results that related to their Facebook  X  X ike X  data. Feegli was deployed to 14 people to use as their primary search engine for 7 days. 506 search queries were made by the user during the diary study and 445 results were recommended by the search engine as serendipitous. 57 distinct events were found where users clicked on the serendipitous search results. Whilst generally confirming empirically grounded models of serendipity [16], the logged behaviours, and insights from the diary entries, support Bogers &amp; Bjorneborn X  X  model of microserendipity [5].
