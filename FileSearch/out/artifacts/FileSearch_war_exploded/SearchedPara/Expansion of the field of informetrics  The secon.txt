 1. Introduction
This special issue is the second one on the broad topic  X  X  X nformetrics X  X , the first one being published as vol-ume 41, Issue 6, 2005 of this journal. The reasons for publishing these special issues are explained in the edi-torial note Egghe (2005) and briefly summarized now. There is the fast multidisciplinary expansion (growth) of the field of informetrics, mainly due to the  X  X  X ew X  X  topics that have been included in informetrics such as the quantitative study of networks, including the Internet. As a consequence, journals such as JASIST (Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology) and Scientometrics have expanded signifi-cantly in recent years (for details, see Egghe (2005) in which one can also find the references dealing with this evolution). The expansion of the field has the consequence that not only new subfields are studied (as men-tioned above) but also that new tools are created such as tools based on hyperlinks and downloads. This opens entirely new informetric challenges for inventing new indicators and for their quantitative study. This requires more and more opportunities of publication outlet, whence these special issues.

It is clear that, as was the case for the first special issue on informetrics in this journal, all informetric topics ( X  X  X ew X  X  as well as  X  X  X ld X  X  ones) can be covered. The  X  X  X nly X  X  requirements for the papers to be included in the special issues are as follows: the papers should be of high quality in the sense that they should contain math-ematical models and/or basic data (i.e., universally interesting data). Also the papers of this special issue fulfill this requirement. Their content will be overviewed below. 2. The papers in this special issue
Informetric models can be found in six papers. The double paper of Bookstein, Moed and Yitzahki entitled  X  X  X easures of international collaboration in scientific literature. Part I and Part II X  X  studies conceptual prob-lems in measuring the degree to which papers tend to cite other papers written by authors of the same nation-ality. One, e.g., deals here with the extra complication of the fact that authors of a paper may come from different countries, a complication that is not present when studying language preference (which was studied before). For more papers on collaboration and citation analysis: see further. The paper of Egghe and Rous-seau (independently refereed) entitled  X  X  X ystems without low productive sources X  X  studies the evolution of IPPs (information production processes) where the number of sources is constant. Using a generalization of the po-sitive reinforcement model one proves that, in these systems, assumed to be Lotkaian, the Lotka exponent decreases while the minimum number of items per source is increasing. Practical examples on country or city sizes and on database sizes confirm these findings. The paper of Lafouge and Smolczewka entitled  X  X  X eading the law of least effort through the mathematical formulation: Exponential informetric process X  X  deals with some mathematical results concerning exponential informetric processes (i.e., where the effort function has an exponential density). Sufficient conditions to have such a process are proved. In the paper  X  X  X odeling citation behavior in management science journals X  X  by Mingers and Burrell one studies citation patterns in journals in this field. A stochastic model (gamma mixture of Poisson processes leading to a negative binomial distribution) describes the generating mechanisms of citations and is further extended to include obsolescence.
For more papers on citation analysis: see further. Finally, the paper of Sahoo and Rao entitled  X  X  X  distribution of impact factors of journals in the area of software: an empirical study X  X  studies the distribution of impact factors in this field (using COMPENDEX and INSPEC databases). The single parameter gamma distribution is identified as the applicable one. The study also shows that IFs of journals are increasing.

On networks we have two papers. First there is the paper of Thelwall, Thelwall and Fairclough entitled  X  X  X utomated web issue analysis: a nurse prescribing case study X  X . Web issue analysis is a new automated tech-nique that gives, rapidly, timely information about a topic by automatically analyzing relevant pages: one uses hyperlink and URL analysis and elements of natural language processing. One also gives statistics regarding these pages, hence giving new insights into a problem. The paper of Guerrero-Bote et al. entitled  X  X  X inary
Pathfinder: an improvement to the Pathfinder algorithm X  X  develops a faster method for the Pathfinder algo-rithm. This is an algorithm to prune social networks (i.e., to cut away less significant links) so that the prin-cipal relations become apparent. It has applications in citation analysis and in IR. For more papers on citation analysis: see further.

More on IR: there is the paper of Prabowo and Thelwall entitled  X  X  X  comparison of feature selection methods for an evolving RSS feed corpus X  X . The paper studies the ranking of terms (as significant topics) in a dynamic system (i.e., time dependent) such as news stories and blogs. Three statistical selection methods are proposed and compared: v 2 , mutual information (MI) and information gain (I). Further on IR and in the context of citation analysis we have the paper of Zitt and Bassecoulard entitled  X  X  X elineating complex sci-entific fields by hybrid lexical X  X itation method: An application to nanoscience X  X . This hybrid method is used to retrieve documents as follows: one starts with a limited lexical seed of literature. This bibliography is then extended using both citing and cited links. More in the field of text mining is the paper of SanJuan and
Ibekwe-SanJuan entitled  X  X  X ext mining without document context X  X . Groups of topics are created by clustering multi-word terms. The clustering is based on lexico-syntactic relations between multi-word terms and not on document co-occurrence. This method (CPCL) is then compared with other clustering algorithms.

Further on citation analysis we have three more papers. The paper of Bar-Ilan entitled  X  X  X n ego-centric cita-tion analysis of the works of Michael O. Rabin based on multiple citation indexes X  X  studies this case using dif-ferent citation tools such as WoS, Google Scholar and Citeseer. These tools are also compared. The paper of
Tsay entitled  X  X  X ournal self-citation study in semiconductor: synchronous and diachronous approach X  X  focusses on the difference between self-citing and self-cited aspects such as the self-citing and self-cited rates. High or low rates characterise certain properties of a journal. Finally, the paper of Zhao entitled  X  X  X owards all-author co-citation analysis X  X  compares author co-citation analysis (ACA) where all authors are counted with ACA where only the first authors are used. More in particular their co-citation maps are compared.

We have two more papers on collaboration. The paper of Marshakova-Shaikevich entitled  X  X  X cientific col-laboration of new 10 EU countries in the field of social sciences X  X  studies the collaboration aspects of these 10 new EU countries with each other and with the other EU and non-EU countries. Based on these data a map of collaboration is constructed and one calculates a measure on collaboration relatedness of two countries. In the paper of Yin, Kretschmer and Liu entitled  X  X  X ome analysis of COLLNET members X  collaboration graph X  X , one finds a heterogeneous, unstable collaboration network. Here, tools for analysis of complex networks are used.

There is a paper on mapping LIS of Janssens, Leta, Gla  X  nzel and De Moor entitled  X  X  X owards mapping li-brary and information science X  X . Different mapping techniques show six clusters in this field amongst which two emerging clusters on webometrics and on patent studies. The next paper is on growth by Sen and Sharma entitled  X  X  X  note on growth of superconductivity patents with two new indicators X  X . These new indicators mea-sure the influence of basic research on technology as well as relative growth (of basic research versus more technological research). The last paper of this special issue is from Braun and Dio  X  spatonyi entitled  X  X  X atekeep-ing in the international journal literature of chemistry X  X . This paper shows the importance of gatekeepers (being the members of the editorial board of a journal) as a science indicator of the importance of a country in a field (here chemistry). This is accomplished by comparing the distribution of gatekeepers per country with the number of papers and the number of citations per country. The decisive power of gatekeepers over the invisible college is demonstrated. Reference
