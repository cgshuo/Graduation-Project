 1. Introduction
The application of polymers and polymeric composites for the structural elements in many industries (primarily in spacecraft, aircraft, ship-building and automotive industry) resulted in neces-sity of adaptation of existed diagnostic methods and development of the new ones, which will be suitable and sensitive to the special kinds of damages occurred in these materials in various operation conditions.

Wide range of structural diagnostic methods, which could be applied to the damage assessment in polymeric and composite structures, covers thermography, ultrasonic and radiographic methods, etc.; however, most of them are limited to the applica-tion in laboratory conditions. One of the oldest and the most promising class of methods is the vibration-based one, which ful fi ll the main of recent requirements to the testing procedures, i.e. the applied methods should be non-destructive and possible non-invasive, they should ensure the detection, localization and identi fi cation of various types of damages in possible early stage of their occurrence and propagation, they should provide a possibi-lity of performing the diagnostics in industrial conditions and fi nally, they should be low-cost. In order to improve the sensitivity of vibration-based methods to the various types of damages the advanced signal processing techniques should be applied. In the last decade the great interest of such techniques was paid to the wavelet-based ones. The wavelet transform is very sensitive to singularities and non-continuities of the processed signals and thus can be applied in the damage detection and localization problems as well.
 and localization of damages in 1D structural parts (e.g. beams).
Douka et al. (2003, 2004) diagnose the single-and double-cracked beams using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with applica-tion of symlets. Other studies on the damage identi fi cation in beams were performed by Rucka and Wilde (2006) . The authors used CWT with Gabor wavelets for the analysis. However, indus-trial requirements for the damage assessment methods cause the necessity of an extension of 1D wavelet-based methods to 2D ones, which makes possible the application of these methods to the spatial surfaces of the structural elements. The damage assessment using 2D wavelet-based methods are being of interest over the last decade. The problem of damage detection and localization in spatial structures was studied by Rucka and Wilde (2006) , Chang and Chen (2004) , Douka et al. (2004) , Loutridis et al. (2005) , Huang et al. (2009) , and Fan and Qiao (2009) . All of the authors used CWT in their methods and various types of 2D wavelets: Gabor, Gaussian, reversed biorthogonal and Mexican hat. Thus, the selection of appropriate wavelets in order to detect the damage and localize its position is one of the crucial problems in the wavelet-based damage assessment. The selection of wave-lets for the damage detection problems was discussed in several studies. Rucka and Wilde (2006) deliberated on the application of various wavelets to this problem and analyzed their effectiveness basing on the length of an effective support and the number of vanishing moments of a given wavelet. Similar study, which was based on the ratios of the latter measures, was presented in
Katunin (2011) considering the B-spline wavelets used for the analysis.

In order to improve the damage identi fi cation algorithms based on the wavelet transform various techniques were studied and applied. Zhong and Oyadiji (2007) employed the stationary wave-let transform (SWT) for crack detection. They also showed that the application of SWT is more computationally ef fi cient than CWT.
G X kda  X  and Kompaz (2009) proposed the method based on the combination of CWT and discrete wavelet transform (DWT).
Another approach to the structural diagnostics problems was proposed in Katunin (2011) . The damage detection and localiza-tion was based on the DWT, which reduces the computation time during data processing. The application of B-spline wavelets in such algorithm provides the great sensitivity in damage detection and reveals the great accuracy of damage localization.
Recently, the improvement of the sensitivity and accuracy of the damage identi fi cation algorithms is based on application of supporting methods for the measurement data processing. These supporting methods often allow for extracting additional diagnos-tic information about the damage presence and location from the measurement data. In the literature, many authors attempt to solve this problem in different ways. More and more attention is paid to a growing number of applications of arti fi cial intelligence and soft computing methods in this domain. Several authors ( Yam et al., 2003; Rucka and Wilde, 2010; Hein and Feklistova, 2011 ) combined the wavelet transform with arti fi cial neural networks (ANN) for the improvement of damage detection and localization in structures. Krawczuk et al. (2001) used genetic algorithms (GA) for the crack localization and estimation of its depth , while in
Radzie  X  ski et al. (2011) the same scienti fi c group presented a hybrid damage detection method using wavelet decomposition and damage indices. The application of GA in order to select optimal parameters for the wavelet transform gives several advantages and allows to improve the accuracy of the damage identi fi cation algorithm. Xiang and Liang (2012) used wavelet analysis together with a particle swarm optimization algorithm in order to improve the detectibility of the damages. Dumont et al. (2010) proposed the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for the parameter optimization in order to improve a wavelet-based method that is applied for investigation of ECG delineation. A novel technique was proposed in Ra fi ee et al. (2009) , where ANN together with GA was used in order to select an optimal wavelet for diagnosing the fault of a gear. Another approach in the machine fault diagnosis was proposed in Tse et al. (2004) . Tse et al. developed a very new wavelet transform, which is named as exact wavelet analysis. Their method is based on the GA that is used for generating an adaptive daughter wavelet to match the inspected signal as exactly as possible. In this way it is feasible to minimize the effect of overlapping and to enhance the accuracy of the damage detection. Also a strong adaptive ability was obtained by
Guo et al., 2005 . They suggested to use a combination of a wavelet neural network and a hybrid of particle swarm optimization as well as a gradient descent algorithm for the classi fi cation of the fault signals in rotating machinery.

It can be noticed here, that there are numerous studies in the literature reporting the merits and limitations of the heuristic optimization algorithms for the improvement of the sensitivity and accuracy of the wavelet-based damage identi fi cation algorithms. Despite of this fact, there is still a lack of relevant comprehensive research concerning the ef fi ciency of heuristic optimization algo-rithms for proper selection of spatial wavelets.

The approach presented in this paper is based on application of various heuristic optimization techniques for fi nding the best values of the parameters of 2D fractional B-spline wavelets used for the damage identi fi cation in composite plates. Basing on the algorithm presented in Chaudhury and Unser (2009) the 2D fractional B-spline wavelets were used and the optimization algorithms were applied in order to select the values of optimal fractional order and shift parameter of the wavelet and scaling function used in the damage identi fi cation procedure. The studies in application of fractional B-spline wavelets for the crack identi fi cation in the beam were carried out Katunin (2013) . He has showed that the application of fractional B-spline wavelets to the damage identi fi cation problems could improve the ef fi ciency of an algorithm. The next studies were carried out by Katunin and Przysta  X  ka (2014) , where the single-and multi-objective evolu-tionary algorithms were used for selection of optimal parameters of the applied pair of scaling and wavelet functions for the crack identi fi cation in a composite beam. Such an approach allows for additional improvement of the damage identi fi cation algorithm, i. e. the optimization algorithm selected the parameters of a wavelet, which were the most sensitive to the damages occurred in the structure. In the presented paper this approach was extended to the 2D cases, hence it allows for the analysis of planar structures. Moreover, several optimization algorithms were applied and com-pared. It should be also mentioned that, in comparison with the previous studies presented in Katunin (2011) , this paper considers the development of applied wavelets. For instance in Katunin (2011) the integer B-spline wavelets were applied, while in the following paper the order of scaling and wavelet B-spline functions are extended to the positive real numbers. The study is also extended to the 2D cases with respect to the previous studies ( Katunin, 2013; Katunin and Przysta  X  ka, 2014 ), where the analysis was performed for the 1D damaged structures. In the current work, the obtained results were also veri fi ed experimentally. Furthermore, the best possible selection of the wavelets parameters was realized using four optimization algorithms such as a single-and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (EA, MOEA), a direct search algorithm (DS), a simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and a particle swarm optimi-zation algorithm (PSO). All comparison results were analyzed in order to select the most suitable optimization algorithm for the investigated problem. Overall, the proposed approach allows for ef fi cient multiple damage identi fi cation in the structures. 2. Theoretical fundamentals of the method 2.1. Complex B-spline scaling functions and wavelets of fractional order
Following to the previously developed algorithm ( Katunin, 2011 ), the presented algorithm is based on DWT, which used the multiresolution analysis introduced by Mallat (1989) , where the B-spline scaling functions  X  ( x ) constitute a space of the square-integrable L 2 ( R ) subspaces and form the sequence of functional spaces V i in the following form: 0 fg ... V 2 V 1 V 0 V 1 V 2 L 2  X  R  X  U  X  1  X 
The general form of the  X  ,  X  -B-spline scaling function of fractional order  X   X   X   X  x  X  was proposed by Unser and Blu (2000) and could be expressed as  X  x  X  X   X  1 where  X  A R is an order of the scaling function,  X  A R is a shift parameter and  X   X   X  is the function in the form  X   X   X  x  X  X  cos where  X  (  X   X  1) is the Euler  X  -function, which allows for fractional factorization. The order of a scaling function  X  could achieve the values in the range ( 0.5, 1 ); in these cases the scaling functions ful fi ll decay properties ( Unser and Blu 2000 ). Moreover, if  X  X   X   X  1  X  = 2 the classical B-spline scaling functions could be constructed from (2) and (3) . The B-spline scaling functions of fractional order are not symmetric in general and have not compact support (except the cases, when  X  = 2 Z ). However, they hold the two-scale relation ( Chaudhury and Unser 2009 ): 1 2 where h  X   X  k is a re fi nement fi lter. They also hold the partition of unity property, i.e. the integer-translates of  X   X   X  can reproduce a unity function.

The B-spline wavelets of fractional order  X   X   X   X  x  X  also ful two-scale relation ( Unser and Blu, 2000 ):  X   X  and most of the other properties of B-spline wavelets of an integer order. However, they have no compact support, when  X  = 2 Z . The algorithm of Fractional Discrete Wavelet Transform (FrDWT) proposed in Unser and Blu (2000) uses the Fourier series and allows to avoid this problem. Chaudhury and Unser (2009) proposed a method of complexi fi cation of B-spline wavelets of fractional order generated using Hilbert transform pairs of them.
Such a transform gives an opportunity to obtain the direction-oriented complex wavelets. The complexi fi cation is based on combination of wavelets with the same order, but different shift values, e.g.  X   X   X  x  X  X   X   X   X   X  x  X  X  j  X   X   X   X  1 = 2  X  x  X  U  X  6  X 
According to the separability property of the B-spline wavelets of fractional order ( Chaudhury and Unser, 2009 ), it is possible to obtain their 2D analogs in the form of permutation of tensor products of scaling and wavelet functions. Considering a fact that the analytic wavelet has a form ( Chaudhury and Unser, 2009 ): where H denotes the Hilbert transform, it is possible to obtain 12 separable complex wavelets corresponding to the four scaling spaces V  X   X  p  X  V  X   X  p  X  , where  X  p  X  x  X  X   X   X  x  X  ,  X  have a form ( Chaudhury and Unser, 2009 ):  X   X   X   X   X   X  where 2 1 = 2 was used for scaling the wavelets. The wavelets (9) are oriented along the primal directions:  X  1  X   X  2  X  0,  X   X  = 2,  X  wavelets (9) could be illustrated by decomposition of the octagon (see Fig. 1 ), cf. Chaudhury and Unser (2009) . As it could be noticed, the values of wavelet coef fi cients are higher along the directions of a given wavelet. 2.2. Signal processing for the damage identi fi cation set of high-pass ~ h and low-pass ~ g fi lters. In the case of 2D DWT the selected pairs of fi lters were applied along the x and y directions to the particular spatial displacements signals s i achieved from the modal shapes. As a result of a single-level decomposition the four subbands could be obtained, namely a  X  n  X  and d N  X  n  X  , where 1 r n r 4 and N  X  H ; V ; D , which denote horizontal, vertical and diagonal subbands, respectively. Then, six complex subbands w
P  X  1,6, could be de fi ned as (cf. (6) ) Chaudhury and Unser (2009) : w  X   X   X   X   X  j  X   X   X   X  10  X  where  X   X  and  X   X  are the block matrices: and  X  and  X  are obtained from the permutations of 12 high-pass subbands:  X  d V  X  1  X  ; d V  X  2  X  ; d H  X  1  X  ; d H  X  3  X  ; d D  X  1  X  hi  X  d V  X  3  X  ; d V  X  4  X  ; d H  X  2  X  ; d H  X  4  X  ; d D  X  2  X  hi
In order to consider all orientations sensitive to the singula-rities in the damage identi fi cation problem, the real parts of complex subbands w P were normalized:
W  X  r Note that the size of W is reduced twice, i.e. s  X  K ; L  X  due to the downsampling operation during the decom-position.

Previous studies ( Katunin, 2011, 2013 ) show, that the magni-tude of values of obtained coef fi cients after decomposition are strongly dependent on the magnitudes of displacements of the modal shape. The equivalence between wavelet coef fi cients and magnitudes of displacements may cause that the damages occurred in the regions with low magnitudes of displacements (e.g. supported and clamped regions, nodes of modal shapes) remain undetectable. Therefore it is obvious to consider more than one modal shape in order to avoid this problem. For the clarity of presentation of analysis results the obtained sets W M are summar-ized with respect to the number of considered modal shapes M . The scheme of a signal processing algorithm is presented in Fig. 2 . 2.3. Optimal selection of parameters of wavelets
The effectiveness of the signal processing algorithm of a damage identi fi cation procedure discussed in the previous section strongly depends on the factors such as the scaling and wavelet functions, which are applied for the analysis. Because of this, it is necessary to determine the most suitable functions that allow to minimize the blurring of the regular form, which indicates the damage. It is also very important to fi nd the cases when the values of detail coef fi cients will have the greatest magnitudes in comparison with the other ones in the matrix W .

As to be expected, it may be achieved by optimizing two fundamental parameters of the scaling and wavelet functions, that is the fractional order  X  and the shift factor  X  . The main purpose of the optimization process is to adjust these parameters in order to minimize a multiple objective function F , which can be formulated taking into account the following two criteria. The fi rst criterion describes the values of detail coef fi cients that have the greatest magnitudes. The second one is correlated with the blurring of the regular form or forms which indicate the damage. Assuming that both of these objectives are not being in con fl ict, the optimization task can be posed as follows:
Minimize F  X   X  ;  X   X  X  f 1  X   X  ;  X   X  f 2  X   X  ;  X   X  boundary constraints that should be chosen taking into account the properties of the wavelet.

Taking into account this consideration, the fi rst payoff function is inversely proportional to all the magnitudes of the peaks: f  X  where T ( p ) is the function that returns the total number of detail coef fi cients with the greatest magnitudes, detail coef fi matrix W 1  X  W and for i 4 1 W i  X  W n i 1 , where W n i 1
W i 1 in which the element with the maximum value is equal to 0. In the physical sense this criterion can be interpreted as follows.
If the damage occurred somewhere in the composite plate then the result of this would be affected on the values of displacements of modal shapes s i . Because of the presence of measurement noise and other sources of uncertainties it is well-grounded to employ the matrix W, which includes results (normalized detail coef -cients) of the damage identi fi cation algorithm that is realized basing on the 2D FrDWT analysis. Moreover, the highest values (peaks) of detail coef fi cients can be observed for such elements of the matrix W that are correlated with the positions of the damages. Considering the situation, when the multiple damages in the structure can exist and have different 2D shapes, it is necessary to identify more than one set of elements of the matrix
W corresponding to these damages. In order to perform this, the T ( p ) function is proposed. Such function can be de fi ned using the following expression: T  X  p  X  X  card w i ; j : 8 i ; j A 1 ; 2 ; ... ; n fg w i ; j where n is the size of the matrix W , whereas p is the ratio between the greatest magnitudes and the other detail coef fi cients in the matrix W . The value of this parameter should be chosen arbitrarily from the range [0, 1]. As one can see, the parameter p can be used in order to decide about the value of the threshold of the fault detection. It is recommended to declare a value of this parameter close to 1, especially for the high-precision measurement devices.
Taking it a step further, the second objective is connected with the blurring of the regular form and other detail coef fi matrix W , therefore it can be written as f  X   X  ;  X   X  X   X  n seen to have the following physical interpretation. The values of elements in the matrix W others than those with the highest magnitudes are caused by origins, such as the measurement noise and computing errors (it can be stated that the values of w matrix represent the blurring of the regular form). Therefore there is the need to compute the matrix W T  X  p  X  based on the matrix W in which the elements with the highest magnitudes are set to 0.
The optimization problem de fi ned above can be solved in several ways. Generally, multi-objective problems have no single global solution, and it is reasonable to investigate a set of points, each of which satis fi es the objectives. In such cases, it is well-founded to use the predominant Pareto optimality concept ( Marler and Arora, 2004 ). A solution is Pareto-optimal if there is no other solution that improves at least one objective function without detriment of another function. It is often considered the same as a non-dominated solution.

Another approach to search for an optimal solution is the global criterion method ( Marler and Arora, 2004 ) in which the objectives f and f 2 are combined in order to form a single function. One of the most general indirect utility functions at this matter can be expressed in its simplest form as the weighted exponential sum:
U  X   X  ;  X   X  X  c where c i are weights indicating the relative signi fi cance of the objective functions, the exponent  X  determines the extent to which a method is able to capture all of the Pareto-optimal points for either convex or non-convex criterion spaces. In this way, the above-de objectives with different orders of the magnitude may have similar meaning and their transformation is not required.
 solving the problem, which has been formulated in the form of (16) or (20) . Standard optimization methods e.g. gradient-based approaches cannot be adapted in this context, mainly due to the form of the objective function f 1 and the measurement noise in the real-world data. On the other hand, for these types of problems pure stochastic optimization methods, for example, Monte Carlo techniques very often are not able to fi nd an accurate solution with guaranteeing polynomial-time convergence. For these reasons, the authors decided to apply and to compare heuristic optimization algorithms such as EA, MOEA, DS, SA and PSO.
 tion problems, which are based on the natural selection process that mimics biological evolution. DS algorithms have been devel-oped heuristically and they are known as pattern search algo-rithms. All pattern search algorithms compute a sequence of points that close in to an optimal point without any information about the gradient of the objective function. The SA method imitates the physical process of annealing, in which a material is heated and in the next step the temperature is slowly lowered to decrease defects and it leads to minimize the system energy. PSO is a population-based stochastic optimization technique, which is inspired by simulation of social behavior. The MOEA proposed in
Deb (2009) is applied to solve the task de fi ned as (16) . Well-known genetic operators for multi-objective optimization are used to guarantee convergence of a solution. As a result, the problem is solved by identifying the Pareto front, hence the set of evenly distributed non-dominated optimal solutions are achieved. On the other hand, in the case of the scalar function (20) the EA ( Deb, 2009 ), DS ( Lewis et al., 2000 ), SA ( Ingber, 1996 ) and also PSO ( Perez and Behdinan, 2007 ) are adapted. 3. The methodology for damage identi fi cation damage identi fi cation is based on the factional wavelet transform of modal shapes with optimized selection of spatial wavelets. The detailed scheme of the damage identi fi cation procedure is pre-sented in Fig. 3 . The damage assessment technique uses the above-described FrWT-based signal processing of the modal shapes of the analyzed pre-damaged composite plates. The performing of the analysis consists of the following steps. Firstly, the acquisition of the displacement data is realized. Then the frequency response functions (FRFs) must be determined for every node of the measurement net. In this way, it is possible to obtain the natural frequencies and corresponding modal shapes s i . The displace-ments of modal shapes are needed to be considered for the further analysis.
 to search for the optimal values of the fractional order  X  shift factor  X  . The initial values of algorithm parameters i.e. and others are dependent on an optimization algorithm engine (EA, MOEA, SA, DS, and PSO). In each step of the algorithm, values of both parameters  X   X  ;  X   X  are updated and then they are used together with modal shapes s i to evaluate the cost/ fi tness function. The computation of the cost/ fi tness function is realized using 2D
FrWT based algorithm. This algorithm is applied following the scheme presented in Fig. 2 . In particular the displacements of each of the modal shapes is fi ltered using a set of high-pass and low-pass fi lters, which resulted in one set of approximation coef and three sets of directional detail coef fi cients for each modal shape. After that the detail coef fi cients (13) and (14) are complex-i fi ed by application of the block matrices (11) and (12) following the formula (10) . Finally, the obtained complex sets w M , i are normalized using the Euclidean metric (15) and summed in order to consider all of the detected directional parts of damages in the set W . The cost/ fi tness function returns the values that are needed by the optimization algorithm engine for the further computations. It is possible to use the objective function F  X  in the form of (16) , where f 1 and f 2 are computed applying the criteria (17) and (18) for the case of the MOEA engine. Whereas, when remaining algorithms are used, then the objective function has to be computed employing the indirect utility function (20) .
The optimization algorithm is stopped when the maximum number of iterations  X  max is exceeded. In such a way, the optimal values of  X  n and  X  n can be used to compute the matrix W necessary for identi fi cation of the damages in a structure with high accuracy and quality. 4. Experimental procedure and results
The proposed algorithm was tested on numerical data obtained from fi nite element (FE) models of square plates and on experi-mental data obtained during the modal analysis. The description of data preparation and results are presented below. 4.1. Preparation of numerical data The numerical models were prepared and calculated using the MSC Marc/Mentat s FE commercial software. The square plates with a side length of 300 mm and a thickness of 2.5 mm were meshed using hexagonal 8-node elements. The plates were clamped along the edges. The material properties of the plates were de fi ned as follows. The stiffness matrix and speci single layer of transversally isotropic glass-epoxy laminate was de fi ned, C 11  X  C 22  X  48 : 01 GPa, C 12  X  C 21  X  19 : 98 GPa, C C 31  X  C 32  X  6 : 592 GPa, C 33  X  11 : 42 GPa, C 44  X  C 55  X  3 C 66  X  14 : 01 GPa, nate was de fi ned through modeler with the following lay-up: 0 = 60 = 60
The damages were modeled by excluding the elements in particular regions. Three cases of damages were considered: through-the-width crack with the width of 1 mm and the depth of 0.5 mm ( Fig. 4 a); square exclusion on the top of a plate with the depth of 0.5 mm ( Fig. 4 b) and a case with multiple damages: the similar square exclusion as in the previous case, additional smaller square exclusion and a crack with the width of 1 mm ( Fig. 4 c), all of the damages in this case have the depth of 0.5 mm. Such cases of damages were selected in order to present the universality of the proposed damage identi fi cation algorithm and for describing interesting phenomena occurred during the analysis.

The surfaces of the modeled plates contained 64 64 equidi-stant nodes. First fi ve modal shapes were taken into consideration during the analysis (see Fig. 5 ). The values of displacements of modal shapes for the investigated cases were collected and converted to the MATLAB s data fi les for the further analysis. 4.2. Preparation of experimental set-up
The glass-epoxy 12-layered laminated square plates with a symbol EPGC201 were manufactured by Izo-Erg S.A. in Gliwice, Poland. The manufacturing procedure and results of the prelimin-ary static tests could be found in Katunin and Gnatowski (2012) . The arti fi cial damages were prepared on the numerical milling machine following the schemes presented in Fig. 4 . The specimens were clamped along the edges by two frames connected by 24 bolts. The frame was connected with electrodynamic modal shaker random noise signal, ampli fi ed by the power ampli fi er TIRA 500. The measurements of displacements were carried out using scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) Polytec s PSV-400 con-nected with a vibrometer controller OFV-5000 with a built-in velocity and displacements decoder. The reference signal was acquired from the point LDV Polytec s PDV-100 focused on the upper frame of a specimen holder. Before the measurements the specimens were covered by the re fl ective powder in order to focus the laser beam and limit an additional in fl uence on the structure. An experimental test rig was presented in Fig. 6 .

The analysis was prepared in the vibrometer-dedicated soft-ware environment. The net of 64 64 equidistant measurement points was de fi ned on the surface of the specimens. The frequency bandwidth was de fi ned in the range of 0  X  3.2 kHz with the resolution of 1 Hz and the sampling frequency of 8.192 kHz. Five averaging cycles of the FRF were performed. Basing on obtained
FRFs fi ve fi rst modal shapes were selected for further analysis. 4.3. Optimization algorithms and selection of their parameters carried out applying the MATLAB s environment with the Genetic Algorithm s , Direct Search s and Particle Swarm Optimization
Toolboxes. The proper choice of the heuristic algorithm para-meters has a large impact on the optimization performance.
Optimization methods such as EA, DS, SA and PSO have several parameters that govern their behavior and ef fi ciency in optimizing a given problem. These parameters have to be chosen by the expert in order to reach satisfactory results. Another important issue that needs to be addressed in this section is the problem of the comparison of such kind of algorithms. The systematic search procedure, as well as heuristic rules, were employed in order to fi nd relevant features of the investigated algorithms, for which the best results of optimization would be obtained. In the fi the global criterion was declared following to (20) with no articulation of preferences, i.e. for the case, where c 1 and  X   X  1. The lower and upper bounds were set as follows of the previous studies ( Katunin, 2013; Katunin and Przysta 2014 ). 4.3.1. Evolutionary algorithm random well-dispersed initial population that satis fi es all bounds in (16) . Fitness scaling was realized using the rank method, whereas the selection of the parents to the next generation was achieved by applying the stochastic uniform method. Additionally, two reproduction options  X  the elite count and crossover fraction p c were chosen. The fi rst one speci fi es the number of individuals that are guaranteed to survive to the next generation (it was equal 2). The second deals with the fraction of the next generation, other than elite children, that are produced by crossover. It was decided to use a simple heuristic crossover operator that returns a child that lies on the line containing the two parents in such a way that the distance between the child and the better parent is deter-mined by the user-de fi ned parameter (it was set to 1.2). The remaining individuals (other than elite and crossover children) are mutation children. They were obtained using the adaptive feasible method. In this study, the convergence of the evolutionary algorithm was veri fi ed specially according to the population size R and crossover fraction p c for the fi tness function in a scalar form (20) . These parameters are critical to ensure, as far as possible, to fi nd the optimal solution of the problem. Following this point of view, several testing trails with multiple realizations have been carried out to examine the convergence of the optimi-zation algorithm for different numbers of individuals R  X  {5,10, ... ,25} (corresponding to notation: EA1, EA2, ... , EA5) and different values of the crossover fraction p c  X  {0.4, 0.5, ... , 1}. 4.3.2. Direct search algorithm
In this study, it was decided to consider three types of the direct search algorithm such as the generalized pattern search (GPS) algorithm, the generating set search (GSS) algorithm, and the mesh adaptive search (MADS) algorithm. The initial solution was generated from the uniform distribution. The cost function was declared using the global criterion (20) . The parameters of the algorithm that are used to complete poll around current iterate and to accelerate convergence near a minimum were set off.
On the other hand, it was decided to set on the parameters that are employed to rotate the pattern before declaring a point to be optimum and for automatic scaling of variables. Six variants for polling and searching strategies were investigated: DS1  X  method realized as GPS positive basis 2Q (Q is the number of patterns) and the search method de fi ned as GPS positive basis
Q  X  1; DS2  X  the poll and search methods were realized as GPS positive basis 2Q and MADS positive basis 2Q; DS3  X  the poll method as GPS positive basis Q  X  1, whereas the search method as
GPS positive basis 2Q; DS4  X  it was realized similar to the DS3 case but the poll and search methods were replaced each other; DS5 and DS6  X  had the same poll method (MADS positive basis 2Q), whilst the search method was chosen as GPS positive basis 2Q in the fi rst case and MADS positive basis Q  X  1 in the second one. The critical parameters of the DS algorithm are mesh contraction and expansion factors. It was assumed that these factors were inver-sely proportional to each other. In this way, it was possible to verify different variants of the algorithm (DS1-6) and, in the same time, to check the in fl uence of the mesh contraction and expan-sion factors on the convergence of the DS algorithm. It should be noted here, that the initial value of the mesh size was set to 25. 4.3.3. Simulated annealing algorithm
This is one of the simplest heuristic algorithm in which three key features must be set up. First of all is the annealing function that is essential in generating new points for the next iteration.
The second is the temperature function, which is necessary to update the temperature schedule. The last one is the acceptance function for determining whether a new point is accepted or not.
In the case of the SA algorithm, it was also needed to fi properties for optimization. Here, the initial solution and the cost function were achieved in the same way as in the previous case.
There were tested several cases of the algorithm: SA1, SA2, SA3, where the annealing function was set in such a way that the step had a length square root of temperature, whereas the temperature function was declared using Boltzmann, linear and exponential reduction methods respectively; SA4, SA5, SA6, where the tem-perature function was computed as before but in the annealing function the step had a length proportional to the temperature.
The initial temperature had the most important in fl uence on the results of optimization. Therefore, during the tests, this parameter was adjusted in order to achieve the best performance. 4.3.4. Particle swarm optimization algorithm
As in the previous cases, the initial point was generated using the uniform distribution. The cost function was computed using the global criterion (20) . In this algorithm only few parameters of the algorithm are critical to ensure, as far as possible, to optimal solution of the problem. One of them is the population size P , the second is the social attraction coef fi cient k third is the cognitive attraction coef fi cient k 2 . Taking into account considerations on a stability analysis provided in Brest et al. (2006) , Clerc and Kennedy (2002) , it was decided that k 4.05 k 2 . Various testing trails with multiple combinations have been carried out to examine the convergence of the optimization algorithm. It was realized for different numbers of particles P  X  {5,10, ... ,25} that is noted as PSO1, PSO2, ... , PSO5 and different values of the cognitive attraction coef fi cient k 2  X  {0.5,1, 4.3.5. Comparative analysis of results
In order to have the possibility to compare all algorithms, it was assumed that the total number of function (cost or fi tness) evaluations was equal to 500. If this value was exceeded then the calculation was stopped. The other assumption was that the comparison would be done for the second case of the damage on the data acquired from the numerical experiment. For each set of the algorithms 0 features the optimization was run 10 times. After-wards, the averaging procedure was affected with the use of the second-order exponential approximation. Fig. 7 shows plots of the means and standard deviations of the best function values obtained for different properties of the analyzed algorithms. It could be observed, that there is a global convergence around a value of 6.22 and it is most frequently obtained, in the average sense, for the case of EA, when the population size R  X  10 and crossover fraction p c  X  0.5. It is also easy to see, that the EA has the smallest value of the standard deviation when compared to the rest of them. In order to present it more precisely, summary results are included in Table 1 .

The next important plot is given in Fig. 8 . This fi gure presents the convergence plots of the investigated algorithms for the best cases from Fig. 7 . For each algorithm the evolution of the averaged values of the indirect utility function (20) of the best solutions over the number of the function evaluations was plotted. Basing on this experiment and the obtained results presented in Fig. 7 ,it was concluded that the fastest convergence could be related to the DS2, where the poll method was declared as GPS positive basis 2Q and the search method was selected as MADS positive basis 2Q. However, the more accurate solution could be obtained using the EA2 with the population size R  X  10 and crossover fraction p
The optimal values of the fractional order  X  as well as the shift factor  X  are given in Table 2 . These results were obtained for either numerical or experimental data with the usage of the best variants of the heuristic algorithms. As it can be seen, there are also results of the multi-objective optimization via MOEA. This algorithm did not compare with others due to the fact that it could be applied directly to solve the task de fi ned as (16) . The relevant features of the MOEA were chosen the same as in the EA. 4.4. Results of identi fi cation of the damages
The results of optimization of the wavelets 0 parameters show that all of the applied optimization algorithms give optimal and almost similar solutions (see Table 2 ). The wavelet order in the most cases tended to the upper bound of the considered con-straints, while the shift parameter always achieved near-integer values. Such a situation was also observed during the previous studies ( Katunin 2013; Katunin and Przysta  X  ka 2014 ). It could be explained as follows. As it was noticed in Katunin (2013) , when reaches the values between 0 and 1 the fi ltering procedure is insuf fi cient, i.e. the magnitudes of detail coef fi cients are biased by the analyzed signal. But for the higher values of  X  the wavelet 0 s energy distributes along its support and the damage positions are blurred in the resulted W -set, which in fl uences negatively on the damage localization procedure. The shift parameter  X  does not achieve the values close to the causal B-splines cases (see Section 2.1 ), which proves that the application of fractional B-spline wavelets with non-constrained  X  might slightly improve the detectibility of the damages.

Basing on the results of optimization (see Table 1 and Fig. 8 )EA was chosen as the most suitable one. The resulted W -sets for the numerically calculated modal shapes of damaged plates were presented in Fig. 9 with optimal wavelets 0 parameters obtained using EA. In order to remove the boundary effect the asymmetrical signal extension approach was applied.
 were detected and precisely localized. The magnitudes of elements of W -sets are slightly shifted, which is caused by considering all detail coef fi cients sets produced during the decomposition (some of them reveal such behavior). However the highest magnitudes are observed precisely in the location of damages. It could be noticed that in the cases corresponded with the damages B and C (see Fig. 4 ), only the boundaries of the spatial damage were detected. It is caused due to the sudden change of displacements on the boundaries of the damage, while inside this region the displacements change monotonically and thus could not be detected by this method. The cases A and C are representative, because they clearly visualize the importance of consideration of multiple modal shapes during the damage identi fi cation proce-dure. In the case A three regions of the elements of W -set with the highest magnitudes are recognizable. These regions were obtained from the higher-order modal shape, while the other considered modal shapes improve the peaks along the crack, which results in the detection of whole crack, even near the boundaries, where the magnitudes of displacements are generally low. In the case C the small spatial damage is not recognizable as fi ne as the other damages; however the crack in the upper region of the plate is well recognizable despite a fact that it is located closer to the boundary than the small spatial damage. This case presents a situation when the displacement magnitudes of all considered modal shapes were not achieved high values. However, if such a situation takes place the additional modal shape with the extre-mum located near the expected damaged region could be con-sidered in order to verify the expectation of the damage presence.
The proposed method was veri fi ed on experimental data. The resulted W -sets for the considered cases were presented in Fig. 10 .
Also in this case the wavelet parameters obtained from EA-based optimization were used.

As expected, the experimental results are biased by the measurement noise and inaccuracies additionally ampli fi ed during the decomposition; however, all of the damages are detectible. In the case A the crack is detectible, but the magnitudes of values near the boundaries are comparable with the noise level. Addi-tionally the high values on the left boundary were probably affected by the measurement errors, i.e. the small displacements near the boundary may create the local extremum, which was detected by the algorithm and ampli fi ed during the boundary effect removal procedure. The spatial damage in the cases B and C is detectable, but the shape of the damage is distorted, which may cause both by the measurement errors and the decomposition procedure. Nevertheless, the experimental veri fi cation of the method shows its effectiveness in detection of different types of multiple damages. The goodness of the results and localization accuracy could be improved by applying the more dense mesh of the measurement points. On the other hand it is connected with the increase of time of performing the experiment. 4.5. Comparative studies
In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method the comparative analysis was carried out. The experimental data were used for the wavelet analysis using selected wavelets. Following the previous available studies the next wavelets were selected for this study: Daubechies wavelet of order 8 ( Bayissa et al., 2008 ), symlet of order 4 ( Douka et al., 2004 ), reversed biorthogonal wavelet of order 5.5 ( Rucka and Wilde, 2006 ) and the integer B-spline wavelet of order 6 ( Katunin, 2011 ). The results of compar-ison were presented in Fig. 11 .

As it could be noticed in all of the above-presented cases the strongest boundary effect is observed. During its reduction the higher values of W -sets are observable on the right boundaries of them. Moreover, the shapes of spatial damages in the second and third damage cases were not well detected. In some cases (e.g. when the biorthogonal 5.5 wavelet was applied) not all of the damages were detected. The proper detection was observed in the last cases (when the B-spline wavelet of order 6 was applied); however the accuracy of localization is poor with respect to the results obtained using B-spline wavelets of optimized fractional order (see Fig. 10 ). 5. Discussion and conclusions identi fi cation in composite plates basing on displacements of modal shapes and its processing using the fractional wavelet transform. The obtained results con fi rmed that the application of spatial fractional B-spline wavelets allows for improving the sensitivity of the method considering a possibility of changing the parameters of the applied wavelet continuously, especially in the case when the parameters of the wavelet are optimized. The results of optimization trials show that for all of investigated heuristic algorithms the computed values are similar. Neverthe-less, basing on the statistical analysis it was found that the evolutionary algorithm was the most suitable for the considered problem due to the lowest values of the standard deviation of the obtained results. It was also veri fi ed by launching this algorithm with a multi-objective criterion. This can be explained by the fact, that there are much more properties and parameters of the evolutionary algorithm to be matched for the given problem, when compared it to other optimization methods. On the other hand, it is not a trivial task to establish these properties and values of the key parameters for investigated algorithms. However, it is well-known, that the selection of relevant properties and values of parameters is often easier for the evolutionary algorithm than for any other heuristic approach. This is con fi rmed by large amount of publications (more than in case of remaining methods) on this topic, especially in the area of industrial applications. From practical point of view, there is a very important fact that it is possible to obtain the comparative results either for sin gle-objective or multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. These ar guments have a great importance in the case of the hardware implementation of a method.
The algorithm with optimally selected wavelets 0 parameters was tested on the numerical data. Results revealed great detect-ibility and high accuracy of the damage localization. Then, the algorithm was veri fi ed on the experimental data, which also gives good results of the identi fi cation of the damages. In order to present the better accuracy of the proposed method the compara-tive study was performed. The experimental results were analyzed using the wavelets proposed in various studies for this type of problem. Obtained results proved the effectiveness of the pro-posed method.

Besides the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and easiness of the application of the latter in the industrial conditions, the method has several dif fi culties and limitations. During the applica-tion of the wavelet transform the boundary effect occurs, which causes the great increase of the magnitudes of detail coef on the boundaries of the analyzed object and thus it makes these regions unable for diagnosing. The boundary effect occurs due to the fi nite length of the analyzed signal, e.g. when the wavelet reaches the boundary, it changes the region outside of the signal to zero-values, which cause the local non-monotonicity and as a result the signi fi cant increase of the magnitude of the detail coef fi cients. The reduction techniques of this effect were discussed in  X  ern X  et al. (2009) and Katunin (2012) ; however there is no ef fi cient mathema-tical tool to remove this. The only possible way to eliminate the discussed effect is to develop the appropriate wavelets bounded on the interval for the investigated problem.

The method also has experimental limitations. First of all, the time of carrying out the measurements is comparatively long, thus the method cannot be applied as an on-line diagnostic tool. There is also the relation between the time of measurements and accuracy of the damage detection and localization. The improve-ment of accuracy requires to scan the greater number of measure-ment points on the dense net, which results in the increase of the measurement time. Moreover, the diagnosed structure should be near-planar, i.e. the curvature of the surface is limited by the angles of mirrors rotation in the LDV head, which is about 30
However, such an angle is acceptable in the most cases, which was proven in the similar analysis on the rotor blade with high degree of out-of-plane curvatures ( Katunin and Holewik, 2013 ).
The presented studies are the part of the ongoing research project. Further studies will be concentrated on the development of new wavelet bases, particularly the non-separable ones, which allow to reduce the boundary effect and to decrease the computa-tion time of the signal processing procedures. Moreover, it is planned to apply the meta-optimization algorithms in order to further improvement of the damage detection and localization accuracy. The developed algorithms will be validated experimen-tally, including the tests in the industrial conditions on the real composite parts of machines.
