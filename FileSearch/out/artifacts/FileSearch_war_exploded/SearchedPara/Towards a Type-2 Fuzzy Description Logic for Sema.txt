 As the fundament of the semantic web [1,2], ontology is playing a very important role in many applications such as semantic search [3]. Being one of the logic supports of ontology, Description logics (DLs) [4] represent the knowledge of an application domain by defining the relevant concepts of the domain (terminologies) and using domain (the world description). As one in the family of knowledge representation (KR) formalisms, the powerful ability of describing knowledge makes DLs express the information more easily in different application domains [5]. Being established by W3C in 2004, OWL (Web Ontology Language) [2,6] becomes the standard knowl-edge representation markup language for the semantic web.
Being expected to be applied in semantic web, semantic search extended the search engine with ontology. Using general ontologies, the most current semantic search versity of Maryland proposed SHOE [7,8], which can find the semantic annotations from web pages. Tap [9,10,11] developed by Stanford University and IBM applies the crease the quality of the retrieval. Swoogle [12,13,14] is designed for the information retrieval in structured documents such as RDF (Resource Description Framework), OWL and so on. At present, more and more semantic search systems are designed based on ontology that is supported by classic DLs. certain reasoning of classic DLs means that the answer of inference only returns more applicable to ontology system. At present, most fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are based on type-1 fuzzy sets, which were proposed by Zadeh in 1965 [15]. However, it was quite late when the fuzzy sets were applied to DLs and ontology System. Without reasoning algorithm, Meghini proposed a preliminary fuzzy DL as a tool for modeling multimedia document retrieval [16]. Straccia presented the formalized Fuzzy ALC ( FALC ) [17] in 2001, which is a type-1 fuzzy extension of ALC . Before long, Straccia language OWL DL, to a fuzzy version [18,19]. 
However, there are some limits in Type-1 fuzzy sets. For example the imprecision cannot be described by a crisp value clearly, which will result the loss of fuzzy infor-mation. To address the problem mentioned above, we propose a type-2 fuzzy ALC and lows. First, we present the syntax and semantics of a type-2 fuzzy extension of ALC , which can represent and reason fuzzy information with OWL, a formalized ontology description language. Besides the format of the axioms defined in Type-2 fuzzy ALC , the reasoning algorithm is also proposed for semantic search. Finally, we design and realize the system of semantic search engine based on type-2 fuzzy ALC and carry out the experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed search scheme. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the condition of rela-tive research and basic concepts of DL, typical ALC and type-1 fuzzy ALC . Section 3 fuzzy DL. Approaches for applying the type-2 fuzzy DL to deal with the description followed by conclusions and future research of the paper. TBox can be defined with the format as following inductively: C  X  f (A, B, R,  X  ,  X  , tion).  X  and  X  are two special atomic concepts named  X  X ottom concept X  and  X  X ni-verse concept X . The syntax and semantics of ALC constructors have been represented in [4].

For the reason we mentioned above, classic DL such as ALC cannot deal with the imprecise description. To solve this problem in DLs, Straccia presented FALC , which Because Straccia used a certain number to describe the fuzzy concepts and individuals in FALC , we call the FALC type-1 FALC [7]. 3.1 Imprecise Axioms in Type-2 Fuzzy ALC membership. Each grade of the membership is an uncertain number in interval [0,1]. which is defined as following: an instance in the fuzzy sets U. It is obvious that type-2 fuzzy sets can be reduced to type-1 fuzzy sets when the primary member ship equals the secondary one. So a type-1 fuzzy set is embedded in a type-2 fuzzy set.
 the imprecise terminological axiom (TBox) and fuzzy individual membership define necessary atomic concepts and roles with some symbols. It is certainly that the base symbols exist in the DL system, but the name symbols are not. In other words, the atomic concepts defined by different axioms may be imprecise, which means that the axiom may not come into existence in type-2 fuzzy ALC TBox. 
For example, given two base symbols named: Animal and FlyingObject, we can define the atomic concept Bird in TBox with the axiom (2). (2) means that the probability value of that bird can be described with the conjunc-tion of the Animal and FlyingObject is between 0.90 and 0.95. define the certain atomic concept Animal without [1,1] concisely. 
Type-2 fuzzy ALC can represent the vagueness in atomic concept with two proper-
Because it can be considered true that ev ery atomic concept (role) is independent, we can calculate the value of fuzzy:LowerDegree and fuzzy:UpperDegree of fuzzy concept if we do not know it beforehand. For example, we want to define an atomic concept Meat-eatingBird with base sym bol Meat-eatingObject with axiom (3): when we apply the triangular norms T(a,b) = ab/[1+(1-a)(1-b)] , S(a,b) =(a+b)/(1+ab) , we can get the value of fuzzy:LowerDegree ( fuzzy:UpperDegree ) of Meat-eatingBird with the follow equation: L  X  (Meat-eatingBird)= T ( L  X  (Bird) ,  X  (Meat-eatingObject)), as men tioned above, we know that L  X  (Bird)=0.9 and 
L  X  (Meat-eatingObject)=1. So L  X  (Meat-eatingBird)= (0.9  X  1)/[1+(1-1)(1-0.9)] = 0.9. So the membership of atomic concept Meat-eatingBird is in scope [0.9,0.95]. We call it transitivity of type-2 fuzzy ALC . 
In addition to the fuzzy TBox, the uncertainty still exists in ABox in fuzzy DLs. The concept Bird should be satisfied in TBox; (2) penguin belongs to bird in ABox. So we can conclude that L  X  (Bird(penguin))= L  X  (Bird)  X  L  X  (penguin  X  Bird) = T (0.65,0.90)=0.565 (so do U  X  (Bird(penguin))). So the ABox can be denoted by a set 3.3 The Syntax and Semantics of Type-2 Fuzzy ALC C = not a set of numbers in scope [0,1] but a set of pairs, which have the form like [a, b]. And it must satisfy the inequation: 0  X  a  X  b  X  1. 3.4 Reasoning in Type-2 Fuzzy ALC Tableau algorithms use negation to reduce subsumption to (un)satisfiability of con-cept descriptions instead of testing subsumption of concept descriptions directly: C  X  here are 5 rules presented:  X   X  C  X  A  X  C  X  (y) [ c ,d ] }where y is an individual not occurring in A before.  X 
Given two limit values: T L and T U , the way to decide whether the ABox in type-2  X  , when anyone of following conditions is established: (1) Any obvious clash (  X  (x), ( C  X   X  C )(x), etc.) is found in process of algorithm. (2) All rules (  X  -rule , etc.) have been executed. 4.1 Architecture of Type-2 Fuzzy Semantic Search Engine The natural languages in daily communication often have imprecise information. We ries, semantic search engines based on ontology must extend their knowledge bases on fuzzy ontologies such as the fuzzy semantic search engine proposed in this paper. Fig. 1 shows the architecture of type-2 fuzzy semantic search engine. 
In this framework, users can propose their query in two ways: they can ask the type-2 fuzzy ontology analyzer with keywords or fuzzy keywords. On the other hand, users can also search the ontology by issuing the semantic query to type-2 fuzzy on-tology questioner (answerer) with keywor ds or other interfaces. Thus, users can communicate with ontology directly with the recalls formed by individuals or classes to make the queries precisely, which are sent to type-2 fuzzy ontology analyzer later. the traditional search engine will find the results from index with these keywords and return the hits to users. 4.2 Experiments and Analysis Based on the framework introduced above, we have implemented the type-2 fuzzy search engine. Supported by the fuzzy ontology reasoner, the semantic search engine based on type-2 fuzzy ALC can improve the relativity of the responses to query. The experiment is carried out in the scope of all resources available in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, including almost 7000 web pages indexed from different departments and 2400 documents. The type-2 fuzzy ontology analyzer, answer, keywords generator and the search engine are all implemented with java. The ontology has built with prot X g X . 
We chose a group of keywords to retrieve information from indexes, and then picked out the relevant hits (hits those are relevant to the retrieval) from result set and when there is no imprecise information in keywords. The reason is that ontology of search engine based on classic ontology decreases rapidly when we add more fuzzy keywords such as  X  X ery X ,  X  X oung X  into the keywords group. Compared to classic ontology, semantic search engine based on type-2 fuzzy ontology can accommodate based on classic ontology increases slower than the one based on type-2 fuzzy ontol-ogy when the number of nodes increases in otology. That means the precision of search engine will be improved if type-2 fuzzy ALC is applied. As the fundament of type-2 fuzzy DLs, type-2 ALC is introduced of its syntax, seman-tics, reasoning algorithm and application in this paper. Comparing with the type-1 fuzzy ALC , the type-2 fuzzy ALC can deal with the imprecise knowledge much better. Besides semantic search, there are many applications based on DLs need to handle fuzzy infor-search of type-2 fuzzy ALCN , SHOIN(D) and the reasoning algorithms.
