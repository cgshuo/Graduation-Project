 Issues of scaling are critical when an infrastructure is trying to grow. Systems that worked well with smaller numbers or particular types of users must change to meet the needs of an expanding and diversified user base. A first step toward growth is to cultivate new users. We present results from research that examines one approach to the challenge of attracting new users to a large-scale computing infrastructure. We describe gateway organizations and the important social and technical support they provide, which help potential users to conceptualize a use for the infrastructure and increase their willingness and ability to use it.

How does an information technology infrastructure scale? Previous studies have shown that when an infrastructure is trying to grow, issues of scaling become very important. New patterns of use are fueled by the expansion, and the infrastructure must change to meet these needs [7, 14, 24]. Consequently, attention to users can become critical to success or failure [7]. This paper's opening question has become incr easingly relevant in a world where large groups of widely distributed people are using systems originally designed for much smaller and often local and well-known communities of users. Libr aries, museums, educational institutions, and scientific laborat ories are a few examples where this trend is visible [13, 23, 24]. The problem of how to design infrastructure in the face of increasing scale has been identified as a pressing and open one [7, 24, 30] . We have been studying this challenge in the context of TeraGrid, a large-scale computing infrastructure that is considered a key part of the U.S. cyberinfrastructure (CI). Specifically, in this paper we analyze the first step toward growth X  X ttracting new users to TeraGrid. Cyberinfrastructure consists of the advanced information technologies that facilitate access to distributed resources such as computational tools and services , instruments, data, and people [1]. A specific aim of CI is to transform both scientific practices and outcomes; its "vision is of data and information intensive, large-scale, distributed, dynamic and inter-disciplinary research collaborations" [17, p. 1675]. In the United Kingdom, eScience has been used to refer to changes in scientific practice that are enabled by cyberinfrastructure [11]. Star [24] observed that infrastructure is a relational concept as opposed to merely a "thing" on whic h something runs or operates. Star, like most authors who have written about infrastructure, noted that among other things, infrastructure is invisible and embedded; it is something we do not generally think about unless it breaks. Star observed that these properties of infrastructure become complicated when we examine ones that are in development or when we analyze the situations of those who are not well served by a particular infrastructure. The important and growing line of research in th e CSCW community focused on CI has concentrated on infrastructures in the process of being built [9, 10, 18, 30]. Here, we address an existing infrastructure that is undergoing change. In this paper, we analyze one approach being used to anticipate and deal with challenges related to increasing both the total number of users and the types of disciplinary communities that employ TeraGrid. In doing so, we make three contributions relevant to the GROUP community. First, we identify and analyze the role of science gateways, a type of mediating organization, which may play a key role in attracting new users to TeraGrid. Specifically, gateways provide social and technical support intended to help potential users conceptualize a use for TeraGrid and increase their willingness and ability to use it. We also find that gateway organizations serve a key role in facilitating interaction between TeraGrid and new communities of users. Second, we extend existing theori es of information technology diffusion by expanding the idea of awareness-knowledge [19] to what we call conceptualization of use . Before there can be new users of an infrastructure, pot ential users must understand what the infrastructure is and then recognize a relationship between its capabilities and the work they wa nt to accomplish. This is a difficult task in the case of TeraGrid because it is a complex infrastructure and use involves multiple steps, specialized knowledge, and the ability to dem onstrate efficient use of the system. Our results show that those who believe TeraGrid can provide the transformative benefits embodied in the CI vision bear the task of helping potential us ers to perceive a use for it. As noted above, this is a key role of the gateway organization. Finally, we argue that although high-performance computing (HPC) systems like TeraGrid have not been defined as CSCW problems in the past, they have quickly become an exciting and vastly unexplored space where knowledge gained and lessons Cyberinfrastructure, of which TeraGr id is a key part, is a relevant topic for the CSCW community because it plays an important role in coordinating scientific work and in supporting collaboration. In the section that follows, we re view literature relevant to the diffusion of information technology to new communities of users. Then, we describe TeraGrid and br iefly discuss factors related to increasing the number and types of users of TeraGrid and the challenges to meeting this demand. In Section 5, we describe our study and the methods we employed. Our findings, which we present in Section 6, analyze the characteristics and goals of gateway organizations, the issues they face, and the measures they employ to attract users. Although it is too soon to evaluate the success of gateways, in the summary in Section 7, we examine factors that might affect their potential to succeed. Finally, we discuss implications for these results, including the need for longer term research on the impact s of gateways and further study on the essential features, organi zation, and operation of gateway organizations. It is important to not e at the outset that this paper is not about users per se because, as we will show, in many cases the new users of TeraGrid do not yet exist. We focus on the job that must be done to cultivate new communities of users. This work includes anticipating and respondi ng to individuals' perceived needs and to barriers that would keep them from using TeraGrid. There are two related streams of research that we draw from to support the work on which this paper is based. These include models of information technology acceptance and studies of the ways mediators, in the form of individuals and institutions, intervene in and shape others X  use of technology. The information systems (IS) lite rature has developed a number of theoretical models in an attempt to explain user acceptance or intention to use information technology. Venkatesh and his colleagues [27] compared eight pr ominent models and formulated a unified model that integrates elements from all eight models. Among others, the models they an alyzed included the Technology Acceptance Model [6] and Innovation Diffusion Theory [19]. Venkatesh et al. refer to the integrated model as the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). According to UTAUT, four constructs are most significant as direct determinates of user acceptance of information technology: believes that using the system will be useful to attain job goals. system. perceives that important others believe he or she should use the system. believes that an organizationa l and technical infrastructure exists to support us e of the system. These four constructs provide a useful frame in which to explore factors that might affect the potential use of TeraGrid by new communities of users. We find, though, that UTAUT de-emphasizes an important aspect of the acceptance process. This step consists partly of what Rogers referred to as awareness-knowledge, and which he define d as "information that an innovation exists" [19, p. 173]. Si milarly, Saxena and Wagenaar [20] described the discovery pha se. Our results expand the notion of awareness and discovery to in clude an individual's ability to conceptualize how the innovation can be applied in the achievement of work-related goals. A small number of investigations have analyzed how different types of mediators shape users' interactions with a technology. Much of the prior work is summarized by Bansler and Havn [2] and Orlikowski and her colleagues [16]. The most relevant of these in terms of issues related to increasing and diversifying the TeraGrid user base is a set of activities that Orlikowski and her co-authors refer to as technology-use mediation , and which they define as The authors state that these activities are part of a process they call metastructuring , which is intended to impart the notion that the mediators structure the use of technology by others through their interpretations and interventions and by modifying the technology itself. The literature referenced above examined individuals as mediators of technology use. Ot her scholars have analyzed the role of institutions as mediators. For example, Damsgaard and Lyytinen [4] described intermediating organizations as institutions that coordinate the activities of potential adopters. They analyzed the role of industry associations in technology adoption decisions; others have examined professional associations [26]. The organiza tions we studied, and which we refer to collectively as gateway organizations, vary along dimensions such as purpose, governance, funding source, longevity, and operations, but they are united by two common goals. The first is to support new types of science, and the second is to hide the details of the computing infrastructure that makes the pursuit of new research questions possible. Historically, high-performance co mputing resources have been used by only a small portion of the science and engineering research community. This is prim arily for two reasons. First, as we describe in greater detail in Section 6.3.2, supercomputers are not easy to use. 1 Thus, their use has been limited to researchers who required them to conduct their work and/or have been willing to surmount the barriers to use. Second, many researchers have not required the computing power that supercomputers provide. Therefore, the use of supercomputers has been reserved for specialized scientific and engineering applications that must handle very large databases or do a great amount of computation. For several reasons there is pressu re on this model to change. We have been studying this evolving situation in the context of TeraGrid, which is a collaboration among nine, independent computing centers. 2 TeraGrid is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and provides integrated access to computational resources, primarily in the form of superc omputers, large amounts of storage space, visualization services, fast networks, and software. TeraGrid also provides support in the use of its resources and services. These sites include major NSF-funded supercomputing centers such as the Nationa l Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), and Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC). While some of the supercomputing centers, including NCSA and SDSC, have been in existence for more than 20 years, TeraGrid is fairly new and has only been in operation since late 2004. The motivation in bringing these individual sites together was to create a grid-based infrastructure to enable scientific discoveries that would otherwise not be possible [3]. There is an ironic side to the demand for TeraGrid to reach new communities of users. Supercomputers are similar to scarce resources such as the most pow erful astronomical telescopes or particle accelerators used in high energy physics. These tools and instruments are too expensive to be acquired by every laboratory, campus, region, or even country th at wants to use them, so they must often be shared. TeraGrid's computing resources are currently oversubscribed and with the growing amounts of data being generated in many scientif ic fields, their data storage facilities are also being stretched. The ability to support growing For the purposes of this paper, supercomputers are defined as the fastest and largest computers available at a given point in time. 
Another phrase that is often used is high-performance computing . A strict definition of this phrase does not exist. In this paper, we use superc omputer and high-performance computing (HPC) interchangeably [15]. The nine resource provider sites are Argonne National Laboratory, Indiana University, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Nationa l Center for Supercomputing Applications, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Purdue University, San Diego Supercomputing Center, and the Texas Advanced Computing 
Center. numbers of users will be a challe nge, especially since new users are likely to be less experienced and will need much more support than existing users. The irony of this situation becomes even greater when one considers that many potential users perceive little or no need for TeraGrid's capabilities and services. Further, if they did they would find that, besides being difficult to use, TeraGrid aligns poorly with thei r expectations, values, and work practices. These are issues that we will discuss in greater depth in Sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2. So, why is TeraGrid trying to attract new users? This is a complicated question that deserv es further investigation and cannot be answered fully in the space of this paper. Suffice it to say that changes in the political, scientific, and technological landscapes are all exerting influence on TeraGrid. For example, many scientific fields are becoming data and computation intensive [8]. Ecologists, for instance, have not been traditional users of HPC resources, but as thei r field begins to move toward big science with teams of researchers from multiple disciplines and sophisticated instruments that collect large amounts of data, they will need different tools a nd technologies to manage, store, and analyze the data they will collect [22]. Similar changes are occurring in other domains, including the humanities and social sciences. In these scenarios, it is easier to imagine that TeraGrid's compute, data, and visualization resources will have a role to play in the future of many disciplines. In addition, technology has reached a point where it is now easier to share data, research tools, and computing power [8]. Changing user expectations also play a role. For example, a recent article in HPC Wire , a leading industry publication, noted that the community of researchers who were part of the first wave of supercomputer users are retiring and that the new generation of researchers grew up with graphical user interfaces and have little or no experience with a command line interface [28]. Finally, competition may also play a role. Continued decreases in the cost of computing and storag e combined with increases in capability mean that scientists are able to accomplish tasks on personal computers and local cluste rs that formerly required the use of a supercomputer. Responding to this competition could be a factor in TeraGrid's success, although this is not clear. In spite of these pressures, it is difficult for TeraGrid to scale. The literature on the historical, social, and technical aspects of infrastructure has identified seve ral reasons for this that are relevant to TeraGrid [7, 24]. These include mismatches between potential new users and the TeraGrid infrastructure and the inability of TeraGrid to interact w ith many individual users. In the next section we briefly introdu ce gateway organizations, which show promise as a means to address these challenges. In section 6 we analyze the gateways we studied in greater depth and show how they are attempting to address a first step toward scaling, which is to attract new users. In the context of infrastructure, a gateway is most commonly defined as a technical device or interface that connects two or more separate computer systems, networks, or programs [5, 14]. An example of a gateway technology is a plug adapter that makes it possible to connect an electrical appliance such as a hair dryer purchased in one country to the electrical outlets found in another country. We argue that a gateway organization can be viewed as a human analog to this common technological solution. In the language of diffusion of innovation theory, gateway organizations attempt to make the supercomputing system compatible with the values and past experiences of potential users, reduce the complexity , and increase the trialability [19]. Those who are developing gateways can be viewed as change agents, individuals who attempt to influence potentia l users' decisions to use the innovation. Early in its history, TeraGrid conceived the idea for what has become the TeraGrid Science Gateway program. Recognizing that many disciplinary communities were building elements of their cyberinfrastructure, TeraGrid set out to form Essentially, the gateway concept recognizes that many of today's scientists use desktop computing applications and web browsers to conduct their work. The program also recognizes that different communities have different needs. TeraGrid's role is as a back end service provider with the gateways serving as the front end to the user. There are currently 21 projects that have an allocation on the TeraGrid and thus are designated by TeraGrid as Scie nce Gateways. A wide range of disciplines are represented including astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, earth science, engineering, materials science, and physics. These projects are similar in that they have cyberinfrastructure. Although a few of the projects receive additional funding from TeraGrid, th is is not their primary source of support. We recognize that we have chosen to borrow the term gateways both from the concept of gateway technologies and from TeraGrid's name for these organizations. As we analyzed our data, however, the term gateway emerged as a fitting concept to represent the social and technical mediation work that these organizations do to try to connect new user communities to the TeraGrid infrastructure. In the s ections that follow, we report how we reached this conclusion and show the means by which gateways attempt to cultivate new users for the TeraGrid infrastructure. The results presented in this paper are part of a larger study investigating the needs of TeraGrid users and the impact of TeraGrid on scientific practice a nd outcomes. To date, we have conducted a large survey of indi vidual TeraGrid users, observed internal TeraGrid meetings, participated on a TeraGrid team, and interviewed more than 85 individuals. 3 In this paper, we draw on data collected during semi-structured interviews with 27 individuals working on 8 differe nt TeraGrid Science Gateway projects. We also incorporate information from interviews with several TeraGrid personnel, who are working closely with gateway projects. All interviews with individuals working on science gateways were conducted face-to-face, and on average they lasted one hour. We interviewed at least one person from each project, although in most cases we interviewed two or more people from a particular gateway. Interviewees were pe ople who on a day-to-day basis spend some portion of their time working on the gateway. They included people with expertise in the scientific domain represented by the project, technologists who are developing and/or making applications and services available through the gateway, and education and outreach professionals. Interviewees had a variety of roles and res ponsibilities and included principal investigators (PIs), technical leads, project managers, and developers. Most interviewees c ould be defined as technologists, although we also interviewed indivi duals who were experts in the domain served by the gateway. We provide few details regarding the gateways we studied since this information could make it easy to identify the projects and thus compromise the anonymity of our respondents. We can state that we investigated gateways serving various disciplines. The questions we asked interviewees varied depending on their role in the project, but in all cases we s poke with at least one person who was able to tell us about the motivation for the gateway, especially the scientific needs that the project was trying to fulfill, the gateway's intended user comm unity, the kinds of resources and capabilities that were perceived as being important for the user community, and the impacts th at the gateway would have if it were successful. We also aske d more specifically about the need for and the role of HPC resources and services within the gateway and experiences in working with TeraGrid. The data consisted of transcript s from interviews, documents and web sites related to TeraGrid a nd the TeraGrid Science Gateways, and our notes and observations. We developed an initial coding scheme for the interview data based on our research question, interview topics, and prior literature. Transcripts were read The survey results and some interview data are still being analyzed. Since the start of the study in mid-2006 interviews have been conducted with a variety of individuals. In addition to those working on science gateways, we interviewed individual users, such as Principal Investigators, other faculty, graduate students, and post doctoral researchers (n=30), researchers who are not TeraGrid users, but who utilize HPC (n=3), TeraGrid personnel (n= 26), and CI experts (n=4). carefully and coded according to the initial coding scheme. In the next section, we report the findings that emerged from our analyses. We begin this section with info rmation on the characteristics of the gateway projects that we studied. From here we analyze their role in helping to attract new users to TeraGrid. It is difficult to describe gate ways along dimensions such as purpose, governance, permanence, source of funding, capabilities, and audiences because there is substantial variation. Most of the gateways we studied are funded by NSF as time-limited collaborative research and devel opment projects similar to those described by Lawrence [9], but others are supported by a combination of funding sources or are embedded in programs or institutions that have longer term stability and more formal and ongoing interactions with their intended user communities. Examples of the kinds of cap abilities that these projects are developing include the ability to run complex climate simulations, to query large databases, or to simplify the submission of jobs to supercomputer resources. For exam ple, Linked Environments for Atmospheric Discovery (LEAD) is attempting to bring together meteorological data, forecast models, and analysis and visualization tools to explor e the weather as it evolves. goal is to automate many of th e time consuming and complicated tasks associated with meteorological science. In LEAD's case, they are trying to serve a range of users from scientists who are experienced in modeling and simu lation using HPC resources to school children and everyone in between [9]. Figure 1 shows the opening screen of the LEAD gateway. Not all the projects we studied are designing for such varied users. Further, in this paper, we restrict our analyses to the perceived needs of researchers who have limited HPC experience. Some gateways are attempting to make available, through one interface, all the applications and resources that scientists in a We use the example of LEAD because it is not one of the gateways we studied in this project. particular community might need to accomplish their research. For instance, one of the projects we studied provides access to over 140 computational tools and many data sets within a collaborative workspace that offers simplified access to a diverse set of tools. The important fact to note despite these variations is that gateways are driven by the perceived or known needs of the intended users. In fields that produce, manage, and analyze large amounts of data, the focus is likel y to be on the development of tools and services to make these tasks easier. Where the problems require increasing amounts of computational power to run simulations, the emphasis is on eliminating the need for the user to learn about the details of th e machine, such as job queue policies, the number of nodes to select, and how to set time and memory limits. Another important point regarding ga teways is that many of them are in development. This is to say that they do not yet have an established user base. Thus, they are preoccupied with trying to enroll users. Since a number of the projects are funded as time-limited research projects, they of ten have very short time-frames in which to achieve adoption of the technology by the community. The role and importance of HPC also varies across projects, but all of them are inco rporating TeraGrid resources to some degree. To summarize, gateways are disciplined-focused, community-driven, and largely in development. In spite of differences in the characteristics of gateway projects and the approaches they take to achieve their objectives there are two broad goals that bind gate way projects together. First, gateways aim to support new types of science and to enable the pursuit of novel research questions. In relation to this point, one interviewee stated: This is similar to what othe r interviewees told us. These cyberinfrastructure projects, and as noted previously, transforming science is an explicit motivation of eScience. Collaboration, especially across disciplines, is also viewed as important by many of the project s, which is another hallmark of the CI movement. A second shared goal among the gateway projects we studied is to make the technology invisible. Hiding the infrastructure makes it possible for users to concentrate on doing science as the quote below illustrates. Or, as another interviewee stated, "It should be become very transparent. It should become like a power grid." Most scholars who have studied infrastructure have noted that it is invisible and embedded except when it breaks or when we examine situations of those who are not served well by a particular infrastructure [24]. The role of gateways is to hide the infrastructure. Our interviews with other TeraGrid us ers lead us to argue that the HPC infrastructure has never fu lly acquired the properties of invisible and embedded. The work that gateways do may change this, however, with the resulting benefits extending to current users. It is well known from prior research that in order for users to adopt technologies, they must offer advantages over current practices, positively change the wa y that work can be performed, and be easy to implement and st raightforward to use [25, 27]. This is also recognized by the gateway projects as succinctly stated by one the interviewees: "Unless there is something extra that a scientist can get, they won't adopt any new technology." In addition to the two broad goals describe above, the gateways we studied share a set of approaches formulated to help them accomplish those goals. These met hods are designed to attract new users by aiding them to In the sections that follow, we define each of these concepts. We concentrate on giving examples of the first two and on showing how gateways are approaching these areas on their own or in partnership with TeraGrid. Since many gateways are new or are in development, the last item, which relates to issues of usability, seems to be a luxury for most pr ojects at this point in time. An interesting aspect of gateways is that most of the requirements do not come from the intended users. This is because, as we noted earlier, many of these individuals do not yet perceive a need for HPC resources and capabilities. As one interviewee succinctly and bluntly stated, "It's hard to sell something to people where the expectation is zero." Thus, c onceptualization of use is concerned with helping potential users to see a relationship between the research questions they want to answer and the capabilities of the TeraGrid infrastructure. Over and over again, interviewees told us that it is critical to work with wh at they referred to variously as "out of the box thinkers" or "early advocates willing to put up with some pain." Individuals working on gateways try to find these people, and then they work closely with them to, as one interviewee said, "figure out what of their science could be applied to various parts of the in frastructure in TeraGrid and other things." What compels gateway developers to exert such effort, especially in situations of low demand or even ambivalence? There are three basic drivers. First, there is a belief that research problems that require gateway technologies and services exist but are not yet recognized by researchers. As one interviewee said, "A lot of biologists don't see the need to look at larger problems; it doesn't mean they're not there." Second, ther e is a notion that if scientists have access to the capabilities available through gateways, their thinking will expand. Thus, there is a sense that us ers will grow into needing the capabilities and functions that Te raGrid provides, although this will not occur over night. Similarly, a domain scientist leadi ng one of the projects noted that there are only a few scientists in his community who know much about the science challenges in the context of computational complexity. Third, and more specific to TeraGrid, is a lack of understanding about what TeraGrid is . As another PI said, "If I don't know what it is, how do I know if I want it?" The notion of conceptualization of use is different from technology design where the designer starts with a need and works to refine that need and develop a solution. In this case, for many potential users, a perceived need is lacking. It is more like the example of electronic mail, which when first available, many people did not recognize a need for. The case of TeraGrid in the context of gateways is more complicated than electronic mail. TeraGrid is a complex infrastructure, and the notion of use includes multiple dimensions, as we will illustrate more clearly in Section 6.3.2. The responsibility for helping potentia l users to conceive a use for TeraGrid falls largely to the gateways. We identified three tactics that gateway projects employ to assist potential users to conceptualize use. As mentioned at the start of the previous section, one of the main things they do is work closely with potential early adopters. One gateway lead explained the importance of establishing trust and then moving on to identify and support specific uses of TeraGrid. In addition, to working closely with individual users, gateways promote the scientific possibilities through presentations and demonstrations at disciplinary conferences, in the classroom, and other venues, and they conduct training sessions and workshops that provide hands on exposure to the technologies. In other words, they market their services in typical ways. When they can, they publicize scientific results based on the use of their gateway. This is difficult, though, since many of the gateways are in development and methods to docum ent the impact of systems like gateways are also in their infancy. Helping users to conceptualize a use for TeraGrid and addressing issues related to their willingness to use it occur simultaneously. Willingness to use relates to how the infrastructure, in this case, TeraGrid, fits with users' values , expectations, and practices. Both conceptualization of use and willingness to use are largely anticipatory activities and depend on gateways X  and/or TeraGrid X  X  abilities to foresee barriers and to work to reduce or eliminate them. However, since many gate ways are in development and TeraGrid is relatively new and th e partnership between the two is nascent, they depend on the tolerance of potential early adopters and their willing to put up "with some pain," as noted above. One gateway developer summed up a common sentiment in this regard. In this section we provide two examples of the multiple sides to TeraGrid use in order to illustrate just some of the mismatches between potential users and TeraGrid that affect users' willingness to use, and we illustrate how the gateways and TeraGrid are working together to solve these issues. There are a number of steps that must be completed before users can even login into a TeraGrid resource. One of the first steps to utilizing TeraGrid is to obtain an allocation. As McCray [12] pointed out in a study of as tronomers and large telescopes, another type of scarce resource, two important things that a researcher needs are access to the resource and sufficient time to use it. To get both in the context of TeraGrid, a researcher submits a written proposal that outlines the research, the algorithms to be used, justifies the amount of time he or she is requesting, and summarizes the resu lts from previous requests, if applicable. The complexity of the proposal process depends on the amount of time requested. Th ere is a simplified request procedure for researchers who are just getting started or who want to test codes on different hardwa re architectures, for example. Even so, as one of the gateway individuals noted: The gateways and TeraGrid recognized this catch 22 situation early on and TeraGrid establishe d what are known as "community accounts." Typically, a gateway PI will write the proposal for the allocation, and if successful, that allocation becomes available to the gateway's community of users. This process eliminates the need for individual users to apply for allocations. It raises problems regarding authentication and accountability of users that have to be dealt with, however. The quote above points to a more difficult issue, however, that currently falls outside the scope of the typical support that TeraGrid is able to offer its users. This concerns code development and/or the porti ng of codes across different machines. Some gateways have taken up the challenge of optimizing existing codes to r un more efficiently on high-end resources. It is widely acknowledge d, however, that this is an expensive service that requires specialized human expertise. Once users have obtained an allo cation and have determined how to logon, they are ready to use th e supercomputer(s) to which they have been granted access. Figure 2 shows a picture of one of the TeraGrid resources. Note the l ack of keyboard or mouse. On the web page for this supe rcomputer, there is a list of 14 topics related to things one must know in order to use it. Below is a list of one of the topics and its related subtopics. Running a job TeraGrid has also worked with the gateways to try to eliminate the need for users to know the de tails listed above. Solutions to this and other barriers that sta nd in the way of attracting new users to TeraGrid often mean adapting policies, which can be much more complex in the distributed organizational structure of TeraGrid than the creation of technological solutions. Finally, in order for individuals to use TeraGrid resources, they must have the knowledge and skill to use the infrastructure to accomplish work; we borrow Rogers's phrase and refer to this as how-to knowledge [19, p. 173]. The ability to use TeraGrid consists of activities such as bei ng able to sit down at a computer and "do" things like submit jobs to remote resources and transfer data across sites. It also incl udes knowing where to go for help when questions or problems arise. As quotes elsewhere in this paper demonstrated, users will not be attracted to new technologies unless they offer si gnificant advantages over current tools. Further, how-to knowledge involves aspects of the usability of the system such as the gateway interface to TeraGrid resources. How-to knowledge differs from willingness to use in that the former implies a degree of acceptance of the infrastructure as something that is useful and stable. Since many of the gateways are in development these issu es have not risen to fore. Rogers asked: "How are needs created?" [19, p. 172]. He noted that individuals may develop a need when they learn that an innovation exists, or change agents can create needs by pointing out of the existence of a desirable innovation. Our results shed light on Rogers's question and illust rate the hard work of change agents X  X ork that is much mo re difficult and time-consuming that the phrase "pointing out" imp lies. In many cases, before new users can make judgments about the expected performance of a system or its ease of use, they must understand what the innovation is and recognize a relationship between its capabilities and the work they want to accomplish. Further, the system must match with users' values, expecta tions, and practices or they will not utilize it unless it offers significant advantages over current tools and technologies. The results from our study of TeraGrid Science Gateways show that a ttracting new users to TeraGrid often involves intense anticipatory activities on the part of both the gateways and TeraGrid, but that gateways bear much of the difficult task of helping potential users to conceptualize a use for the infrastructure. These issues are applicable in many other CI contexts. The findings from this study also suggest several implications of gateway organizations. First, gateways are a mechanism for transition and growth. They provide important social and technical support that help new us ers to conceptualize a use for TeraGrid. The most significant contribution that our findings make to literature in the area of user acceptance of technology is to extend Rogers's [19] notion of awareness-knowledge to a broader construct of conceptualization of use . Gateways also have the potential to increase users' willingness and ability to use the infrastructure. The concept of in termediating institutions [e.g., 4, 20] described institutions as mediators in shaping the diffusion of technology. Gateways are another type of organization, albeit a diverse one in terms of their characteristics, that attempt to intervene in and shape the use of technology by entire communities. Finally, gateways play an important role in facilitating interaction between TeraGrid and new communities of users. It is difficult for TeraGrid, which has less than 150 FTEs, to interact with potentially thousa nds of new users. Thus, the gateway concept can also be viewed as a mechanism of interaction. In this last section, we expl ore implications for both science gateways and TeraGrid stimulat ed by the study's findings. We begin by discussing three main points concerning the expansion of an existing infrastructure and the relative concerns for gateways, gateway users, TeraGrid, and funding agencies in regard to these issues. First, growing an infrastructure can take a long time [18]. As one of the interviewees stated, "We are nowhere close to meeting our community needs." Referring to individuals in the arts and humanities, a member of the TeraGrid project noted: This requires an ongoing and active commitment on the part of gateways, many of which are precarious. As noted previously, most gateways are funded as limited-time research projects, which has important implications for the stability and sustainability of these organizati ons and for TeraGrid's ability to rely on the roles they fulfill. One implication of this is that funding agencies should take the longevity issue more seriously. Another is that TeraGrid should take into account the role that gateways play in cultivating ne w users and provide additional ways to support their efforts. There are likely to be other possibilities as well. We believe that clarity in regard to these topics is important to deal with tensions that might arise from them. Second, if TeraGrid is to provide support to gateways or if funding agencies decide to exte nd the terms of support for these projects, then there must be ways to identify and evaluate factors related to success of science ga teways, first in attracting new users, and later in finding ways to sustain and adapt to that use. Areas for future research include the essential features of successful gateway organizations. For instance, what kinds of skills and expertise should be available? What methods are most effective in helping individuals to conceptualize use? How should gateways be engaged with their broad community of users? David and Bunn [5] noted that gateway technologies have consequences; so, too, do gateway organizations , and these should be explored further. For one, gateways are shaping the conceptualization of use. The GROUP community could play an important role in helping to design methods for users to have an active and effective role in the conceptualization process. Finally, at this point in time, many gateways are not necessary to users. Interviewees noted that databases, such as the Protein Data Bank are resources that scientists in certain fields require. In many respects, TeraGrid is also necessary because it has unique capabilities and resources. Gateways are generally not in this advantageous situation. They work hard to cultivate users both for themselves and for TeraGrid. But the work that gateway organizations do to help reduce the mismatch between potential user s and TeraGrid should benefit current users, too. Our interviews with current users of TeraGrid show that their needs would also be served by the work that the gateways and TeraGrid are doing to make the TeraGrid infrastructure more transparent. TeraGrid users comprise a broad spectrum, however. Furthermore, a small percentage of users currently utilize 80% or more of TeraGrid's resources, and while these users might welcome improveme nts in ease of use, it is not their overriding concern. The prim e issue for the "super users" is to obtain as much of the available resource as they can, and they will put up with a lot of inconvenience on the usability side to achieve this goal. More than once in the interviews we conducted with TeraGrid personnel and individual users we heard that the "high-end, high-performance user is going to do whatever they've been doing." As one person put it, "It's hard to teach old dogs new tricks." To summarize, the conservative influence of the existing elements of TeraGrid, such as current us ers, hardware and software, and policies and procedures, push against the needs of new types of users [14]. This may change, though, as the first wave of HPC users retire and the second generation exerts their influence. These tensions will be part of the growth of TeraGrid, and gateways are only one way in wh ich these "growing pains" might be addressed. One part of pushing forward needs in a context marked by limited, shared resources; heter ogeneous, often competing, and evolving user requirements; a nd technological change requires formal, representative processe s and interaction among gateway organizations, other users of Tera Grid, and TeraGrid itself. As one gateway PI noted: Gateway organizations can help to address this disparity in scale, but even they can find the demand of keeping up with system and software changes and interacting with the TeraGrid bureaucracy to be intimidating, tim e-consuming, and costly. At a workshop we conducted recently as part of a process for planning the future of TeraGrid, individuals working on gateways suggested that such problems might be alleviated with better education and communication between TeraGrid and the gateways and among gateways themselves. These kinds of activities are not well-supported currently and are areas ripe for the GROUP community to explore. In their seminal paper, Schmid t and Bannon noted that "mutual dependence in work does not refer to the interdependence that arises by simply having to share the same resource" [21, p. 13]. The situation that the authors describe is very much like the one that currently exists in the wo rld of high-performance computing where many users share access to the same resources without direct interaction with each other. As Schmidt and Bannon state "...people certainly have to coordinate their activities but to each of them the existence of the others is a mere nuisance and the less their own work is affected by others the better" [21, p. 13]. Although supercomputing does not currently meet Schmidt and Bannon's definition of the type of work within the realm of CSCW, our findings show that this situation is rapidly destined to change. The evolution of HPC will be affected by new users. Thus, the story to be told in the future will be different, and it is likely to be influenced by the still unfolding story of TeraGrid and science gateways. The GROUP community should be a part of this new chapter. We are grateful to those we interviewed for sharing their knowledge and experiences with us .
