 Online forums have become a popular source of information due to the unique nature of information they contain. Inter-net users use these forums to get opinions of other people on issues and to find factual answers to specific questions. Top-ics discussed in online forum threads can be subjective seek-ing personal opinions or non-subjective seeking factual infor-mation. Hence, knowing subjectivity orientation of threads would help forum search engines to satisfy user X  X  informa-tion needs more effectively by matching the subjectivities of user X  X  query and topics discussed in the threads in addi-tion to lexical match between the two. We study methods to analyze the subjectivity of online forum threads. Exper-imental results on a popular online forum demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

Online forums contain huge amounts of discussions be-tween Internet users on domain-specific problems such as camera, operating systems, notebooks, traveling, health, etc., as well as discussions related to daily life experiences. Such information is difficult to find in other online sources (e.g., product manuals, Wikipedia, etc.) and, hence, these forums are increasingly becoming popular among Internet users. Since these forums contain massive volume of information, finding relevant information often becomes challenging for users.

Internet users search online forums, generally, for two types of information. Some search the forums for subjec-tive information like discussions on a certain topic to edu-cate themselves about multiple points of view related to the topic, people X  X  opinions, emotions, evaluations, etc. Others pose queries that are objective and have short factual an-swers. Previous works on online forum search have focused on improving lexical match between searcher X  X  query key-words and thread content [12 , 1, 2]. However, these works do not take into account a searcher X  X  intent, i.e., the type of information a searcher wants. We explain this point with the following example. Consider the two queries issued by a searcher to some camera forum search engine: 1.  X  X ow is the resolution of canon 7D? X , and 2.  X  X hat is the resolu-tion of canon 7D? X . Both queries are about the resolution of canon 7D (and may look similar at first sight), but the searcher X  X  intent is different across the two queries. In the first query, he seeks opinions of different camera users on the resolution of the Canon 7D camera, i.e., how different users feel about the resolution, what is their experience (good, bad, excellent, etc.) with Canon 7D as far as the resolution is concerned; hence the query is subjective in nature. In the second query, the searcher does not seek opinions, but a factual answer to a specific question, which, in this case, is the value of the resolution, and therefore, the query is objec-tive in nature. Hence, queries having similar keywords may differ in their intents. Search algorithms based only on key-word search would perform badly for these types of queries. In order to answer these types of queries effectively, forum search engines need to first identify the type of information a searcher wants, as well as the type of information a docu-ment unit (usually a thread) contains, and then match the two in addition to their lexical match.
The current work addresses a part of this problem. We propose methods to identify the type of information a forum thread contains. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been addressed by any previous work on subjectiv-ity analysis and on online forums. We identify two types of threads in an online forum: subjective and non-subjective . Subjective threads discuss subjective topics that seek per-sonal opinions, viewpoints, evaluations, and other private states of people, whereas non-subjective threads discuss non-subjective topics that seek factual information. Figure 1 shows a subjective thread from an online forum, Trip X  X dvisor New York. Figure 2 shows a non-subjective thread from the same forum. In the former, the topic of discussion is whether to tip or not after bad service? , which seeks opinions, whereas the latter seeks factual information about bands/artists playing in December in Madison Square Gardens .

We propose a simple and effective classification method using textual features obtained from online forum threads to identify the two types of threads. We model the task as a bi-nary classification of threads in one of the two classes: jective and Non-subjective . We use combinations of words and their parts-of-speech tags as features. The features are generated from different structural units of a thread such as title, initial post, reply posts and their combinations. We performed experiments on a popular online forum, Trip Advisor X  X ew York.

Our contribution. Our work is the first to perform sub-jectivity analysis of online forum threads automatically. We believe that retrieval models can improve ranking functions by incorporating subjectivity match between users X  queries and threads. We show that simple features generated from n-grams and parts-of-speech tags work reasonably well for identifying subjective and non-subjective discussion threads in online forums.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The next sec-tion overviews the related work in the field of subjectivity analysis. Section 3 describes the features used for classifi-cation. Section 4 gives details of data collection and anno-tation. We describe our experimental setting and present the results in Section 5.Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses the future work.
Subjectivity analysis has received a lot of attention in the recent literature. For example, subjectivity analysis of sen-tences has been widely researched in the field of Sentiment Analysis [5, 10, 7, 8]. An integral part of sentiment anal-ysis is to separate opinionated (generally subjective) sen-tences from un-opinionated (non-subjective) sentences [ 10] by classifying sentences as subjective or non-subjective and then sentiments in the opinionated sentences are classified as positive or negative. Finally, a summary of sentiments is generated [ 7]. Previous works in this field have mainly focused on online product reviews sites where the aim is to summarize product reviews given by the users [ 5, 8]. In con-trast, our work aims at predicting subjectivity orientation of online forum threads for use in improving their retrieval. In sentiment analysis, only subjective sentences are of inter-est because sentiments are generally expressed in subjective language whereas in our application, a user X  X  query governs the interest, i.e., threads having similar subjectivity orienta-tion (subjective or non-subjective) as that of a user X  X  query are of interest.

Other recent works have used subjectivity analysis to im-prove question-answering in social media [ 6, 3, 14, 16, 13]. For example, Stoyanov et al., [14 ] identify opinions and facts in questions and answers to make multi-perspective question-answering more effective. They showed that an-swers to opinion questions have different properties than answers to factual questions, e.g., opinion answers were ap-proximately twice as long as fact answers. They used these differences to filter factual answers for opinion questions thereby improving answer retrieval for opinion questions. Somasundaran et al., [13 ] recognized two types of attitudes in opinion sentences: sentiment and arguing and used it to improve answering of attitude questions by matching the at-titude type of the questions and answers in multi-perspective QA. Li et.al. [6] used classification to identify subjectiv-ity orientation of questions in community QA. Gurevych et.al. [3] used an unsupervised lexicon based approach to classify questions as subjective or factoid (non-subjective). They manually extracted patterns of words that are indica-tive of subjectivity from annotated questions and scored test questions based on the number of patterns present in them. These works analyzed the subjectivity of questions and an-swers that are usually given by single authors in community sites . In contrast, we analyze the subjectivity of online fo-rum threads that contain replies from multiple authors.
We assume that threads discussing subjective topics would contain more subjective sentences in contrast to the threads discussing non-subjective topics. A subjective sentence ex-poses private states of mind such as emotions, opinions, evaluations, speculations, etc. of the author whereas a non-subjective (objective) sentence contains factual materials [ 15]. This difference usually results in different vocabulary and grammatical structure of these two types of sentences [ 11]. To capture these differences, we used words, parts-of-speech tags and their combinations as the features for classifica-tion. We used the Lingua-en-tagger package from CPAN 1 for part-of-speech tagging. The following features were ex-tracted for a sentence in different structural units (title, ini-tial post, reply posts, etc.) of a thread: (a) Bag of Words (BoW) : all words of a sentence. (b) Unigrams + POS tags (BoW+POS) :allwordsof (c) Unigrams + bigrams (BoW+Bi) :allwordsand (d) Unigrams + bigrams + POS tags (BoW+Bi+POS) :
Table 1 describes feature generation on a sentence contain-ing three words W i ,W i +1 and W i +2 . POS i ,POS i +1 and POS i +2 are the parts-of-speech tags for the words W i ,W and W i +2 , respectively. For feature representation, we used term frequency as the weighting scheme (we empirically found it to be more effective than tf-idf and binary representa-tions), and used minimum document frequency for a term as 3 (we experimented with minimum document frequency 3, 5 and 10 and 3 gave the best results).
To evaluate our approach, we used threads from a pop-ular online travel forum: Trip Advisor X  X ew York that contains travel related discussions mainly for New York city http://search.cpan.org/dist/Lingua-EN-Tagger/Tagger.pm . We used a publicly available dataset 3 [1]thatcontains 83072 threads from which we randomly selected 700 threads for our experiments.
 We hired two human annotators for tagging the threads. The annotators were asked to tag a thread as subjective if its topic of discussion is subjective or non-subjective if the topic of discussion is non-subjective.The annotators were provided with a set of instructions for annotations. The set contained definitions of subjective and non-subjective topics with examples and guidelines for doing annotations. The instruction set and the tagged dataset can be downloaded from the authors X  website. 4
The overall percentage agreement between the annotators and Kappa value were 87% and 0 . 713. For our experiments, we used the data on which the annotators agreed. There were 412 subjective and 197 non-subjective threads which indicates that online forum users tend to discuss subjective topics more.

In this section, we describe our experimental setting and report the results.
We used a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier [9] for clas-sification because it performs well on word features (We also experimented with Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logis-tic Classifiers, Bagging and Boosting with tf, tf-idf and bi-nary as the feature encoding schemes and found that Naive Bayes outperformed all the others except SVM where the performances were almost equal). We used 5-fold cross val-idation to evaluate the performance of our classifiers and Weka data mining toolkit [ 4] with default settings to con-duct our experiments.

As described in Section 3, we conducted experiments with four kinds of features: (i) bag of words (BoW), (ii) uni-grams and POS tags (BoW+POS), (iii) unigrams and bi-grams (BoW+Bi), (iv) unigrams, bigrams and POS tags (Bow+Bi+POS) extracted from the textual content of dif-ferent structural units (title, initial post, reply posts) of the threads. First, we built a basic model where we used only the text of the titles (denoted by t) for classification. Then, we used the text of initial posts and reply posts. We ex-perimented with the following four settings: title (t), initial post (I), title and initial post (t+I), entire thread (t+I+R).
Table 3 reports the results of the thread classification. We report macro averaged (the weighted average of a metric for http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g60763-i5-New York City New York.html http://www.cse.psu.edu/ sub194/datasets/ForumData.tar.gz www.personal.psu.edu/pxb5080 subjective class and non-subjective class) precision, recall and F-1 measure. To test the statistical significance of our results, we used the cross-validated paired t test for the dif-ference in two F-1 measures with significance level of 0 . naive baseline that classifies all the threads in the subjective (majority) class will have a macro-averaged precision, recall and F-1 measure of 0 . 457, 0 . 676 and 0 . 545 respectively. Our most basic title (t) model (Table 3) beats this baseline.
Effect of different features : We expect the BoW+Bi and BoW+Bi+POS features to perform better than BoW and BoW+POS features as they contain more information about the thread text. Contrary to our expectation, for the title (t) setting, BoW and BoW+POS perform better than the two more advanced features. We conjecture that this is due to the informal nature of the titles. In many forum threads, titles only contain keywords related to the topic of discussion and hence are not well-formed sentences with proper grammar. For other settings, BoW+Bi and BoW+Bi+POS perform better than BoW and BoW+POS as expected.

Effect of different structural units : We see that titles give fair estimate of thread X  X  subjectivity and initial posts (I) provide a better estimate. We expect this as initial posts contain the entire problem of discussion whereas titles only contain some key words related to the problem. Incorpo-rating text from initial post in title (t+I) improves the per-formance slightly over the initial post (I) model. Further, adding the text of reply posts (t+I+R) gives the best per-formance.

Many online forums provide search functionalities for threads based only on titles as titles contain important information about the discussion problem [ 1]. But for subjectivity anal-ysis, it turns out that initial posts and reply posts are better indicators of a thread X  X  subjectivity. Hence, in order to use subjectivity analysis of threads in improving online forum search, search engines would need to reconsider the impor-tance to be given to titles, initial posts and reply posts. This is an interesting direction in online forum search and we plan to investigate it as a future work.
In this paper, we presented a supervised machine-learning approach to classifying online forum threads as subjective or non-subjective. Our experiments show that features gener-ated from n-grams and parts-of-speech tags of the textual content of forum threads give promising results and using the text of initial post and reply posts significantly improve the classification performance over the title (t) model. In the future, we plan to investigate the use of potential lexical clues of subjectivity and other features to further improve the subjectivity classification.
We would like to thank Sujay Patel for his help in con-ducting the experiments.
