Cumulative distribution networks ( CDNs ) are a recently proposed graphical model for the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF) of many variables. The CDF arises in the problem of ranking multiple objects (e.g.: webpages , biological sequences) in which there is uncertainty about the pairwise preferences between objects being ranked and statistical dependencies between the preferences must be accounted for . W e show that CDNs provide an ef ficient graphical representation for structured loss functionals and that previous methods for ranking such as RankNet , ListNet and ListMLE can be viewed as CDNs with particular topologies.
