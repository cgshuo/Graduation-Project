 In this work, we demonstrate a web application, available at http://d-index.di.unito.it , that permits to analyze the scien-focusing on the collaborations that contributed to define their curricula. The presented application allows the user to analyze the profile of a researcher, her dependence de-grees on all the co-authors (along her entire scientific pub-lication history) and to make comparisons among them in terms of dependence patterns. In particular, it is possible to estimate and visualize how much a researcher has benefited from collaboration with another researcher as well as the communities in which she has been involved. Moreover, the application permits to compare, in a single chart, each re-searcher with all the scientists indexed in DBLP by focusing on their dependences with respect to many other parameters like the total number of papers, the number of collaborations and the length of the scientific careers.

The evaluation of the work of a researcher and its impact on the later literature has been widely studied because of its real and relevant applications, like recruitment, funding allo-cation, and so forth. With the growing of new on-line digital platforms, like DBLP, Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic Search, CiteSeer, etc., it is becoming easier than ever to ex-plore and experiment ways of evaluating research products thanks to their aggregated information, like co-authorships, number of citations and related data. Despite this, even con-sidering these web services, an author X  X  publication and/or citation record gives only a partial account of the author X  X  scientific profile. Indeed, in an evaluation process some co-authored works can unconditionally favor researchers who collaborated with those experts who were able to lead high-quality research projects. On the other hand, those who produced such relevant research products could not be dis-tinguished (within their pure publication list) from their co-authors because of the typical assumption of a proportional collaboration among them.

Given these considerations, while many works evaluate the quantity and/or the quality of the research, (one among all, the h -index [2] and its different variations, a distinct part of the problem involves the study of co-authorship depen-dences, in terms of scientific influence among the authors. The evaluation of such collaboration networks is anyway a challenging task that, to the best of our knowledge, received few interests so far. Some tools like DBLPVis, ArnetMiner or Microsoft Academic Search permit to visualize the aca-demic career of a researcher through her co-authorship re-lations; however, they only show the relationships among authors based on the number of co-authored papers and are not suitable for such a challenging task.

In this paper we demonstrate a way to estimate this dependence degree among co-authors and present a set of graphical tools, integrated in the web environment http://d-index.di.unito.it , for permitting analyses, comparisons and evaluations of researchers X  dependences.
In this paper we make use of a novel measure of depen-dence between two co-authors, presented in [1], called d -index, which is calculated based on the co-authorship net-work that represents the common environment they have Figure 1: B ipartite dependence Graph : two authors a 1 and a 2 and the set of co-authors that they have in common ( Net a 1 ,a 2 ). been working in. This is modeled through a Bipartite Dependence Graph , or BDG , which aim is to represent two authors in their scientific environment, defined as the set of co-authors they have in common. More in detail, given two authors a i and a j , we define their BDG a i ,a { V
The weight w of each edge within the BDG represents the relative dependence of a collaboration between two authors with respect to a co-author. In other words, each weight represents how much the collaboration between a pair of au-thors is dependent on the collaboration with a common co-author. Considering the example shown in Figure 1, given the authors a 1 and a 2 and one of their co-authors, a 3 , the weight of the edge connecting a 1 and a 3 in BDG a 1 ,a 2 sents the dependence of the collaboration between a 1 and a on the scientific assistance of a 2 . This information quantifies how much the collaboration between a 1 and a 3 depends on the contribution of a 2 . More formally, given two authors a and a j and one of their common co-authors a k , we define the relative dependence w a j a i ,a k of the collaboration between a and a k on a j as where This relative dependence w a j a i ,a k ranges from 0 to 1 ; in par-ticular, w a j a i ,a k  X  0 indicates that the dependence of the scientific collaboration between a i and a k relatively to a negligible, while a w a j a i ,a k  X  1 highlights the contrary.
At this point, given two authors a i and a j , and their re-search network Net a i ,a j , it is possible to compute the depen-dence degree, d -index, of a i on a j by calculating the average dependence of all the scientific collaborations of a i on the contribution of a j . Thus, we calculate the dependence index, d -index, of a i on a j , as where p a i ,a j is the productivity of a i and a j together (as before, calculated as the number of papers they co-authored together) and p a i is the total productivity of a i .
It is important to notice that, while the first term permits to numerically quantify the impact of this scientific collabo-ration over the entire bibliographic record of a i , the second term calculates the average of the relative dependences of the scientific collaborations of a i on a j . The formula lies in the range [0 , 1] as well. The higher the value of the d -index, the higher the scientific dependence of a i on the collaboration with a j . Please notice that d a j a i 6 = d a i a scientific network is the same ( Net a i ,a j = Net a j ,a relative dependences on the co-authors can significantly dif-fer, since they are based on their personal collaborations.
Now, given an author a i and her list of d -index values related to her co-authors, we can also calculate her over-all dependence coefficient as her dependence degree on the set of co-authors on whom she resulted more dependent. In a sense, we aim to quantify how much a researcher has been able to work without the scientists on whom she re-sults more dependent. Thus, given an author a i and the set of her co-authors on whom she resulted more dependent K i (calculated applying an adaptive cut-off to the ordered list of d-index values), we calculate the dependence coeffi-cient of a researcher a i as her dependence degree on K a In particular, we first define the scientific network of a K (where K a i = { a 1 , a 2 , a p } ). Then, for each co-author a k  X  Net a i ,K a i , we calculate the relative dependence of the collaboration between a i and a k on the authors in K a i where
At this step, we use all these relative dependences to cal-culate the dependence coefficient of a i as with K a i (i.e., the number of research output co-authored by a i and at least one author in K a i ).
T he web-based application, presented in Section 4, in-cludes several tools for visualizing information about all the researchers indexed by the DBLP service. In this section we present them in detail.
The first way to analyze the scientific dependences of a researcher is to plot the d -index values, in ascending order, related to her co-authors, as a curve within a Cartesian co-ordinate system (Figure 2(b)). This visualization scheme gives a first insight into an author X  X  career by showing in a single chart the ordered dependences with respect to all her co-authors.

This curve can be also leveraged as an instrument for com-parisons among different authors with respect to shared co-authors. However, considering that the co-authors of two researchers are most of the time different, in order to per-mit this comparison, we also present another chart where we map onto the x -axis a set of meta-authors where each one of them represents one co-author of each considered researcher.
More formally, given two authors a i and a j and their set of co-authors, Net a i = { a i, 1 , a i, 2 a i,n } and Net { a j, 1 , a j, 2 a j,m } (where a j,t is the t -th co-author of a ordered by the d -index values, and n is not necessarily equals to m ), we map onto the x -axis a set of meta-authors Net meta = { a k, 1 , a k, 2 a k,r } where each author a k,h  X  Net meta represents one co-author of each researcher and r = m if m  X  n , otherwise r = n .

This way, we permit to compare scientists based on their highest dependence values instead of their shared co-authors (that, obviously, not necessarily exist). In a sense, we com-pare researchers based on their absolute dependence values without taking into account on whom they are dependent. An example is shown in Figure 2(c).
While the previous visualization scheme provides a simple way to analyze the dependences of a researcher, it does not permit to evaluate the reciprocal ones. In fact, given two scientists, it could be difficult to establish who of them is more dependent on the other by only analyzing their curves. For this reason, considering an author a i , we introduce her Mutual dependence Curve , that plots all her co-authors onto the x -axis and, for each co-author a k , it shows their mutual dependence calculated as d a k a i  X  d a i a co-authors are ordered based on these values.

Using this simple tool, it is possible to distinguish the col-laborators who depend on the considered researcher (those plotted under the x -axis) from those that more likely lead the scientific collaborations with the considered researcher (those plotted above the x -axis).
Since researchers tend to work in communities, we pro-vide a tool for analyzing scientific dependences among au-thors with respect to the communities they form. As the mutual dependence curve does, our tool called Collabora-tion Map shows the mutual dependences onto the y -axis. Regarding the x -axis, we aim to plot the co-authors based on the local communities they form with respect to the con-sidered researcher. In particular, starting from an author a we compute her square collaboration matrix C i where both rows and columns represent her co-authors, and C i [ j ][ k ] is the number of papers of a i co-authored by both a j and a (the diagonal C i [ j ][ j ] simply reports the number of out-comes that a i produced in collaboration with a j ). From this, we compute a dissimilarity matrix of co-authors D i cos measures the cosine similarity between two vectors, C and C i [ k ], representing, respectively, the j -th and k -th rows of the collaboration matrix of the author a i . We then ap-ply the well-known X-Means clustering approach (which is able to automatically determine the optimal number of clus-ters), to the dissimilarity matrix in order to find clusters of co-authors who collaborated prolifically among them with respect to considered author (the communities are then vi-sualized within the chart with different colors).

At this point, we need to map this information into a one-dimensional ordering (the x -axis). For this, without loss of generality, we use multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) pro-posed in [3] to embed the co-authors onto a 1-dimensional order. This chart allows us to graphically group the co-authors based on their scientific relations (i.e, the closer the authors onto the x -axis, the more productive is their collabo-ration with respect to the considered researcher), to identify the local communities in which the author is involved, and to estimate the roles the co-authors play within the local communities with respect to the considered researcher (for each co-author, the lower her y -value, the more scientifically dependent on the considered researcher). An example is shown in Figure 2(e).
Finally we provide a set of tools for comparing, from dif-ferent points of view, the considered author with the all the scientists indexed in DBLP (1,097,418 researchers). In particular, we analyze, in three different charts, the rela-tion between the dependence coefficient of an author (Sec-tion 2) and three parameters: the total number of her pub-lished papers, the total number of her co-authors and the length of her scientific career (expressed in years, from her first publication to her last one). Within these charts, all the researchers within DBLP are mapped with blue points, whereas the considered researcher is highlighted in red. This way, it is possible to compare each researcher with the entire community by focusing on different parameters, and accord-ing to the dependence coefficients. Moreover, within these charts, it is possible to map multiple authors and compare them with respect to the entire community.
In this section we present a web environment, avail-able at http://d-index.di.unito.it , for evaluation of scien-tific dependences among researchers. The considered data set contains information about the 1,097,418 authors and the 1,924,030 papers indexed by the DBLP bibliographic form the following operations: in this example, also focused on the comparison with Dr. Brin) (f).
Figure 2 shows a set of screenshots taken from the pre-sented web application. Within this system a user can search for authors and analyze their scientific profiles, according to the proposed measures. In particular, the system permits to query the database by typing an author X  X  name and disam-biguate, if it is necessary, the authors X  list that match the query. The user can therefore analyze the scientific profile of the selected author (Figure 2(a)) by studying her scientific career (visualized as a histogram of papers per year), the complete list of scientific outcomes (through the standard information as the title, the name of the conference/journal, the year of the publication, etc.), the entire list of co-authors over the entire career, and much more.

Then, as shown in Figure 2(b), it is possible to analyze her dependence curve that visualizes her scientific dependences (plotted as explained in Section 3.1). The curve permits to graphically order her co-authors with respect to their d -index value. The user can visualize this in two different ways (curve or histogram).

Using the dependence curve, it is also possible to compare the considered researcher with different authors; an example is shown in Figure 2(c). Then, the user can analyze her sci-entific relationships with her co-authors by visualizing her Mutual Dependences Curve (Figure 2(d)), graphically sepa-rating the authors who depend on the considered researcher (in blue) from those he is dependent on (in red). Moreover, by visualizing the Collaboration Map (Figure 2(e)), it is pos-sible to get an alternative view of her dependences by also taking into account her communities (intended as groups of co-authors). In this way it is possible to analyze the re-search groups in which the author has been involved and, for each of them, the relative dependence of each researcher belonging to it on the considered author. Finally, the ap-plication permits to compare the researcher with the entire community by focusing on the dependence coefficient with respect to different parameters (number of papers, number of co-authors and length of the career). Within these charts, it is possible to plot multiple authors (Figure 2(f)). [1] L. Di Caro, M. Cataldi, and C. Schifanella. The [2] J. Hirsch.
