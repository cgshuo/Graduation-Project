 Two complementary and non-interactive literature sets of articles, undiscovered public knowledge (UDPK). This paper proposes a semantic-based mining model for UDPK. Our method repl aces manual ad-hoc pruning with using semantic knowledge from the biomedical ontologies. Using the semantic types and semantic relationships of the biomedical concepts, our prototype system can identify the relevant concepts collected from Medline and generate the novel hypothesis between these concepts. The system Raynaud disease/fish oils and migraine/magnesium. Compared with previous approaches, our methods generate much fewer but more relevant novel hypotheses, and require much less human intervention in the discovery procedure.

We introduce a semantic-based mining model that explains how relationships or associations among concepts can be semantically induced. The model takes an advantage of semantic knowledge in biomedical ontologies, such as UMLS [http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov] and MeSH [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/mes hhome.html] for identifying biomedical concepts and their semantic types and semantic network in UMLS to identify meaningful correlations among concepts.

In the second experiment the system could not find Swanson X  X  B concept ( spreading cortical depression ) both spreading cortical depression and migraine ; in other words, relationship with migraine .

Pyridines Fish Oils Protirelin mining method for Undiscovered Public Knowledge. For a given starting medical concept, it discovers new, potentially meaningful relations/connections are novel and can be useful for domain expert to conduct new experiment, try new treatment etc. The most significant novel feature of our method is that it automatically uncovers novel hypothesis/connection among relevant biomedical concept with minimum human intervention. Our method takes advantages of the biomedical ontologies, MeSH and UMLS. Using only the initial relations and two relation filters Bio-SbKDS can automatically generate the semantic types for B and A concepts. Using the semantic types as category restrictions and Bi-Decision Maker [1], Bio-SbKDS finds out A concepts through Medline search. Acknowledgments.
