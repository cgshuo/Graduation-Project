 Predicate X  X rgument structure (PAS) has been shown to be highly valuable in tasks such as infor-mation extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003; Miyao et al., 2009). In this research, we develop a resource for analysing the predicate X  X rgument structure of Taga-log, a free word order language native to the Philip-pines, and carry out preliminary empirical investiga-tion of PAS parsing methods over Tagalog.

The motivation for this research is the investiga-tion of the interaction between information structure and word order in Tagalog. That is, we wish to de-termine the utility of discourse-based contextual in-formation in predicting word order in Tagalog, in a natural language generation context. We see PAS as the natural representation for this exploration. This research clearly has implications beyond our imme-diate interests, however, in terms of resource cre-ation for an NLP resource-poor language, and the facilitation of research on parsing and parsing-based applications in Tagalog. It is also one of the first in-stances of research on PAS parsing over a genuinely free word order language. Tagalog is an Austronesian language of the Malayo-Polynesian branch, which forms the basis of the na-tional language of the Philippines, Filipino (a.k.a. Pilipino) (Gordon, 2005). It is a verb-initial lan-guage, with relatively free word order of verbal arguments (Kroeger, 1993), as exemplified in the word-order variants provided with (1). There are no discernible meaning differences between the pro-vided variants, but there are various soft constraints on free word order, as discussed by Kroeger (1993) and Sells (2000). In addition to these free word order possibilities, Tagalog exhibits voice marking , a morpho-syntactic phenomenon which is common in Austronesian lan-guages and gives prominence to an element in a sen-tence (Schachter and Otanes, 1972; Kroeger, 1993). This poses considerable challenges to generation, because of the combinatorial explosion in the pos-sible ways of expressing what is seemingly the same proposition. Below, we provide a brief introduction to Tagalog syntax, with particular attention to voice marking. 2.1 Constituency There are three case markers in Tagalog: ang , ng and sa , which are by convention written as separate preposing words, as in (1). These markers normally prepose phrasal arguments of a given verb.

The sa marker is predominantly used for goals, recipients, locations and definite objects, while ng marks possessors, actors, instruments and indefinite objects (Kroeger, 1993). Ang is best explained in terms of Tagalog X  X  voice-marking system. 2.2 Tagalog Voice Marking Tagalog has rich verbal morphology which gives prominence to a particular dependent via voice marking (Schachter and Otanes, 1972); this special dependent in the sentence is the ang -marked argu-ment.

There are 5 major voice types in Tagalog: Ac-tor Voice ( AV ); Patient/Object Voice ( OV ); Da-tive/Locative Voice ( DV ); Instrumental Voice ( IV ); and Benefactive Voice ( BV ) (Kroeger, 1993). This voice marking, manifested on the verb, reflects the semantic role of the ang -marked constituent, as seen in the sentences below from Kroeger (1993), illus-trating the 3 voice types of AV , OV , and BV . (2) Actor Voice ( AV ) (3) Object Voice ( OV ) (4) Benefactive Voice ( BV ) In each case, the morphological marking on the verb (which indicates the voice type) is presented in bold, along with the focused ang argument.

In addition to displaying free word order, there-fore, Tagalog presents the further choice of which voice to encode the proposition with. For this research, we annotated our own corpus of Tagalog text for PAS. This is the first such resource to be created for the Tagalog language. To date, we have marked up two chapters (about 2500 to-kens) from a narrative obtained from the Guten-berg Project 1 called Hiwaga ng Pagibig ( X  X he Mys-tery of Love X ); we intend to expand the amount of annotated data in the future. The annotated data is available from www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/ 3.1 Part-of-speech Mark-up First, we developed a set of 5 high-level part-of-speech (POS) tags for the task, with an additional tag for sundries such as punctuation. The tags are as follows:
These tags are aimed at assisting the identification of constituent boundaries, focusing primarily on dif-ferentiating words that have semantic content from those that perform a grammatical function, with the idea that function words, such as case markers, gen-erally mark the start of an argument, while open-class words generally occur within a predicate or ar-gument. Closed-class words, on the other hand (e.g. sentence conjuncts) tend not to be found inside pred-icates and arguments.

The advantage of having a coarse-grained set of tags is that there is less margin for error and dis-agreement on how a word can be tagged. For future work, we would like to compare a finer-grained set of tags, such as that employed by dela Vega et al. (2002), with our tags to see if a more detailed dis-tinction results in significant benefits.

In Section 4, we investigate the impact of the in-clusion of this extra annotation on PAS recogni-tion, to gauge whether the annotation effort was war-ranted. 3.2 Predicate and Argument Mark-up Next, we marked up predicates and their (core) argu-ments, employing the standard IOB tag scheme. We mark up two types of predicates: PRD and PRD -SUB . The former refers to predicates that belong to main clauses, whilst the latter refers to predicates that oc-cur in subordinate or dependent clauses.
 We mark up 4 types of arguments: ANG , NG , SA and NG -COMP . The first three mark nominal phrases, while the last marks sentential comple-ments (e.g. the object of quotative verbs).

We follow the multi-column format used in the CoNLL 2004 semantic role labelling (SRL) task (Carreras and M ` arquez, 2004), with as many columns as there are predicates in a sentence, and one predicate and its associated arguments per col-umn. 3.3 Annotation Our corpus consists of 259 predicates (47 of which are subordinate, i.e. PRD -SUB ), and 435 arguments. The following is a breakdown of the arguments:
Count: 83 193 147 12 3.4 Morphological Processing In tandem with the corpus annotation, we developed a finite-state morphological analyser using XFST and LEXC (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003), that extracts morphological features for individual words in the form of a binary feature vector. 2 While LEXC is or-dinarily used to define a lexicon of word stems, we opted instead to list permissible syllables, based on the work of French (1988). This decision was based purely on resource availability: we did not have an extensive list of stems in Tagalog, or the means to generate such a list. In this section, we report on preliminary results for PAS recognition over our annotated data. The ap-proach we adopt is similar to the conventional ap-proach adopted in CoNLL-style semantic role la-belling: a two-phase approach of first identifying the predicates, then identifying arguments and attaching them to predicates, in a pipeline architecture. Pri-mary areas of investigation in our experiments are: (1) the impact of POS tags on predicate prediction; and (2) the impact of morphological processing on overall performance.

In addition to experimenting with the finite state morphological processing (see Section 3.4), we ex-periment with a character n -gram method, where we simply take the first and last n characters of a word as features. In our experiments, we set n to 3 and 2 characters for prefix and suffixes, respectively.
We treat each step in the pipeline as a structured learning task, which we model with conditional ran-dom fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) using CRF ++. 3 All of the results were arrived at via leave-one-out cross-validation, defined at the sentence level, and the evaluation was carried out in terms of precision ( ), recall ( R ) and F-score ( F ) using the evaluation software from the CoNLL 2004 SRL task. 4.1 Predicate identification First, we attempt to identify the predicate(s) in a given sentence. Here, we experiment with word context windows of varying width (1 X 6 words), and also POS features in the given context win-dow. Three different strategies are used to derive the POS tags: (1) from CRF ++, with a word bi-gram context window of width 3 (A UTO 1); (2) again from CRF ++, with a word bigram context window of width 1 (A UTO 2); and (3) from gold-standard POS tags, sourced from the corpus (G OLD ). A UTO 1 and A UTO 2 were the two best-performing POS tag-ging methods amongst a selection of configurations tested, both achieving a word accuracy of 0.914. We compare these three POS tagging options with a method which uses no POS tag information (N O POS). The results for the different POS taggers with each word context width size are presented in Ta-ble 1.

Our results indicate that the optimal window size for the predicate identification is 5 words. We also see that POS contributes to the task, and that the rel-ative difference between the gold-standard POS tags and the best of the automatic POS taggers (A UTO 2) is small. Of the two POS taggers, the best per-formance for A UTO 2 is clearly superior to that for A 4.2 Argument Identification and Attachment We next turn to argument identification and attach-ment, i.e. determining the word extent of arguments which attach to each predicate identified in the first step of the pipeline. Here, we build three predicate recognisers from Section 4.1: N O POS, A UTO 2 and G
OLD , all based on a window size of 5. We com-bine these with morphological features from: (1) the finite-state morphological analyser, (2) character n -grams, and (3) the combination of the two. The re-sults of the different combinations are shown in Ta-ble 2, all based on a word context window of 3, as this was found to be superior for the task in all cases.
The results with character n -grams were in all cases superior to those for the morphological anal-yser, although slight gains were seen when the two were combined in most cases (most notably in re-call). There was surprisingly little difference be-tween the G OLD results (using gold-standard POS tags) and the A UTO 2 results. In this paper, we have presented a system that recog-nises PAS in Tagalog text. As part of this, we cre-ated the first corpus of PAS for Tagalog, and pro-duced preliminary results for predicate identification and argument identification and attachment.

In future work, we would like to experiment with larger datasets, include semantic features, and trial other learners amenable to structured learning tasks.
