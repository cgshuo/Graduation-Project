 Supplier categorization refers to the process of dividing suppliers of an orga-nization into different groups according to the characteristics of the suppliers so each group of suppliers can be managed differently within the organization. Supplier categorization is an important step in supplier relationship management (SRM), a business strategy to reduce the logistic costs and improve business per-formance. Many large enterprises such as retail chain stores, manufactures and government bodies work with thousands of various suppliers to provide raw ma-terials, middle stage products, final products and services. Management of these suppliers not only affect the logistics of a company but has a direct impact on the business performance of the company[1]
A common method adopted in many organizations is to classify suppliers based on the product categories which suppliers can provide or the demographi-cal characteristics of suppliers such as co mpany X  X  size and location. These static characteristics do not always reflect th e business reality between suppliers and the buyer, for example, the quality of the products supplied, the product delivery time, and costs. Therefore, categorization of suppliers based on static character-istics results in some suppliers mismanaged with a consequence of increasing logistic costs and damaging the entire business performance of an organization. A better approach to this problem is to categorize suppliers based on dynamic business behaviours. In this way, the suppliers with similar business behaviours can be grouped together and managed in the same way. We call it a data-driven categorization method. It is based on examining suppliers X  real performance to classify suppliers into groups[2].

Suppliers X  business behaviours can be described as the set of product items it has provided in a given time period, a mount of each item in each order, the frequencies of orders, as well as oth er attributes such as product quality, product arrival time, etc. These kinds of information are derived from real busi-ness transactions over time and represe nted as a set of behaviour attributes. By grouping suppliers based on behaviour attribute values, suppliers with similar business behaviour patterns in the same time period can be grouped together. As the business behaviour patterns for some suppliers may change over time, this data-driven categorization approach is dynamic and can better reflect real business situations.

One technical challenge of this data driven approach is the space of behaviour attributes which can become very larg e in order to better represent supplier behaviours. For example, if we consider the number of unique product items provided by all suppliers as behaviour attributes, this number can easily exceed thousands in many large buyers. Therefore, this is a high dimensional data clus-tering problem. Another challenge is the data sparsity. Take the product item attributes as an example. In business reality, any supplier usually supplies a small subset of product items. We use the set of product items as behaviour at-tributes to describe suppliers, each supplier only has few attributes with values and leaves many attributes empty. This phenomenon represents a serious sparse problem in data. Therefore, the data-driven supplier categorization is a large, high dimensional, sparse data clustering problem which needs special clustering techniques to handle effectively[3].

In this paper, we present a subspace clustering method for data-driven supplier categorization. We use the r ecently developed clustering algorithm FW-KMeans [4][5][6] to categorize suppliers from business behaviours repre-sented in a large, high dimensional sparse data matrix. FW-KMeans is a k-means type subspace clustering algorithm that identifies clusters from subspaces by au-tomatically assigning large weights to the attributes that form the subspaces in which the clusters are formed. The most remarkable metric of the algorithm is that it can handle highly sparse data. We have applied FW-KMeans to text data, which outperformed other k-means clustering algorithms. This work is the first time to apply FW-KMeans to dynamically categorize suppliers from high dimensional, sparse behaviour data which is different from the text data distribution.

We have applied our data-driven supplier categorization approach to a real dataset from a food product retail chain company. This company operates over 330 outlets in a large Chinese city to se ll both Chinese and Western food prod-ucts. It has more than thousands suppliers around the world to supply over seven thousands different product items to its shops. To improve their supplier relation-ship management and reduce logistics costs, this company wanted to readjust its current supplier groupings based on dynamic business behaviour patterns. We have used the FW-KMeans clustering algorithm to its supplier transaction data and produced satisfactory results for the company. Some important results in this work include the following:  X  We propose a data-driven supplier categorization approach to categorize sup- X  We propose to use the k-means type subspace clustering algorithm FW- X  We have applied this approach to a real data set to demonstrate its usefulness
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data-driven supplier categorization. Section 3 presents the method of subspace clus-tering with the feature weighting k-means algorithm. Following the discussion of our method, we present, in Section 4, a real case study of using FW-KMeans to categorize suppliers for a food product retail chain company. Finally, we draw some conclusions and point out our future work in Section 5. Supplier management manages the busines s with suppliers, including supplier selection, purchase order (PO), product delivery, quality control and payment. Effective supplier management can reduc e logistic costs and affects the bottom line of business in a company. In a company, suppliers are usually divided into groups managed by different portfolio managers. Suppliers in each group are categorized with product categories provided and demographical characteristics of suppliers such as company X  X  size and location.

The above static categorization of suppliers does not really reflect the real business behaviours of suppliers in supplier groups. For example, two suppli-ers in the same group that provide similar product categories and have similar demographical characteris tics may commit business in very different ways. For example, one supplier may always delay the delivery where the other can only provide a subset of products in good quality. Although these two suppliers are in the same group, they should be treated d ifferently. Identification of different business behaviours of suppliers requires dynamic analysis of business data to discover the business behaviour of each supplier and categorize them accord-ing to the real business behaviours. This process is called data-driven supplier categorization which can help better unde rstand suppliers, adjust the supplier grouping, and make the supplier management more efficient[7].

Figure 1 shows the system architecture for data-driven supplier categorization and management. We can consider this as a component of the enterprise business intelligence solution system. The outputs of this component are used by supplier relationship management or supply chain planning and optimization. The sup-plier categorization component integrates two categorization results, the static categorization based on supplier X  X  product data and demographic data, and the dynamic categorization based on the data of business transactions committed by suppliers. To conduct dynamic categorization, the large volume of transaction data needs to be converted into behaviour data in the data pre-processing steps.
The business behaviour of a supplier at a given time period can be described by a set of behaviour attributes, such as the set of product items purchased in the past 6 months, the quantity and amount of each item, the delivery of each purchase and the quality of the products in each delivery, etc. Each supplier is represented as a set of values of these behaviour attributes. The entire set of suppliers is represented as an N x P matrix where N is the total number of suppliers and P is the total number of behaviour attributes used to represent behaviours of all suppliers. Each element of the matrix is the value of a particular attribute for a particular supplier.
When the supplier behaviour matrix is created, the dynamic categorization of suppliers is treated as a clustering prob lem, i.e., clustering suppliers based on the behaviour attribute values. Given a matrix and a clustering algorithm, this can be easily done. However, the real characteristics of the behaviour matrix represent a number of challenges to the clustering algorithms. (1) The matrix can be very large with thousands of suppliers and behaviour attributes. This is a very high dimensional data clustering problem. (2) The matrix may contain different types of data, depending on the selected behaviour attributes. (3) The matrix is very sparse, i.e., different suppliers have values in different subsets of behaviour attribute. For example, if we use the product items as behaviour at-tributes, different suppliers supplied different kinds of products to the company, e.g., some supplying food products and some supplying toys. In this case, the suppliers providing food products did not have values for the toy product item attributes while the suppliers supplying toy products did not have values for the food product item attributes. This high sparse matrix requires the clustering algorithms to be able to find clusters from the subspace of the behaviour at-tribute space. Therefore, in this work, we use the newly developed k-means type subspace clustering algorithm FW-KMeans we discuss in the following section. The FW-KMeans algorithm was developed to cluster text data with high dimen-sionality and sparsity [6]. In text clustering, documents are represented using a bag-of-words representation [8]. In this representation (also named as VSM ), a set of documents are represented as a set of vectors X = {X 1 , X 2 ,..., X n } .Each vector X j is characterized by a set of m terms or words, ( t 1 ,t 2 ,...,t m ). Here, the terms can be considered as the f eatures of the vector space and m as the number of dimensions representing the total number of terms in the vocabulary. Assume that several categories exist in X , each category of documents is characterized by a subset of terms in the vocabulary that corresponds to a subset of features in the vector space. In this sense, we say that a cluster of documents is situated in a subspace of the vector space.

The supplier behavior data can be represented in the same way. Each supplier is equivalent to a document and each behavior equals to a term in the vocabulary which is equivalent to the set of behavior attributes. Table 1 shows a simple example of the supplier behavior data matrix. There are 6 suppliers divided into two groups. Each column i is a behavior attribute for a product item. 1 indicate that the company bought that product from the supplier while 0 means that product item was not bought. The real supplier behavior data matrix can be much larger than this simple one.

We can see that there are many zero ent ries in the table. In clustering we need to focus on the attributes with non-zero values, instead of the entire at-tribute space. How to find clusters from the non-zero attributes while ignoring the attributes with zero values is a problem of subspace clustering that can be solved by the feature weighting k-means algorithm[4].

The feature weighting k -means finds the weight for each feature from each cluster. Let  X  =(  X  1 , X  2 ,..., X  k ) be the set of weight vectors for all clusters;  X  l =(  X  l, 1 , X  l, 2 ,..., X  l,m )betheweightsfor m features from the l th cluster. During the k -means clustering process, FW-KMeans automatically calculates the feature weights which produces a k  X  m weights matrix. That is to say, in each cluster m weights are assigned to m features. The weights can be used to determine which attributes are important in discovering the clusters. To calculate the weights in the k-means clustering process, we minimize the following cost function: subject to  X  where k (  X  n ) is a known number of clusters,  X  is an exponent greater than 1 [5]; W =[ w l,j ]isa k  X  n integer matrix; Z =[ Z 1 ,Z 2 ,...,Z k ]  X  R k  X  m represents k cluster centers; d ( z l,i ,x j,i )(  X  0) is a distance or dissimilarity measure between object j and the centroid of cluster l on the i th feature. Usually, we use Euclidean distance:
The value of parameter  X  will affect the feature weighting process. If  X  is much to 1 m . This will make the clustering process back to the standard k -means. If  X  is too small, then the gap of the weights between the zero dispersion features and other important features will be big, therefore, undermining the importance of other features. To balance we calculate  X  based on the average dispersion of the entire data set for all features as follows: where o i is the mean feature value of the entire data set. In practice we use a sample instead of the entire data set to calculate  X  . (5% sample is used according to the sampling theory [9].)  X  n is the number of objects in the sample. Experi-mental results in [4] have shown that this selection of  X  is reasonable to produce satisfactory clustering results and identify important features of clusters. In this section, we discuss the use of FW-KMeans to categorize suppliers from a real data set taken from a food retail chain company and present the results. We first present supplier transaction data and conversion from transaction data to behavior descriptions of suppliers. Then we show the clustering results and discuss validation analysis. 4.1 Transaction Data A supplier business behavior in a given time period is recorded in a set of business transactions occurred at different time p oints. A business transaction records a purchase of food products of a set of product items. The most relevant data at-tributes in a transaction include the amount, quantity and price of each product item and the time and date that the transaction was committed. In this experi-ment, We extracted transaction data of 974 suppliers in a 10 1/2 month period, from 1 January 2004 to 16 November 2004. Below is the summary of the data [10].

The company has a total number of 2,399 suppliers that are grouped into four broad categories: active external suppliers, inactive external suppliers, in-ternal suppliers with a supplier coded as 4XXXXX and internal suppliers with a supplier coded 9XXXXX. We were only interested in the 974 active external suppliers. Each record of the row transaction data contains much information. The focus of our studies is to classify suppliers according to the actual trade data using our clustering algorithm. We pre-processed the transaction data and converted it into behaviour attribute representation so the suppliers could be clustered according to behaviour patterns.

The behaviour data matrix has 100 columns and 974 rows. Each column rep-resents one item category and each row represents one supplier. In the behaviour data, we only consider the items each supplier has provided. The cell of the ma-trix is the purchase amount (its dimension is money) for each supplier on each item category. Figure 2 show the data matrix. A black dot in the figure denotes that the supplier bought certain quantity of the given category. A blank cell indi-cates that the corresponding supplier didn X  X  supply the corresponding category items. We can see that the data is very sparse.
 4.2 Supplier Categorization with FW-KMeans In this section, we discuss use of the FW-KMeans clustering algorithm to catego-rize the 974 suppliers based on the behaviors of product item supplying patterns. We first converted the transaction data into a supplier and behavior attribute matrix. The behavior attributes are 100 top product items purchased and the elements of the matrix are the purch ase amount which was normalized to be a proportion of the real purchase amount over the total purchase amount from this supplier. This would make two suppliers of different sizes with the same purchasing pattern very similar. In this way, the suppliers in a cluster have the same set of items purchased and the purchase amount for each item accounted for the same portion of total purchases.

The company already categorized their existing suppliers based on the static information of the suppliers. Because of the dissimilarity of purchase patterns in different suppliers of the same category, the current supplier classification makes a lot of bias on the supplier relationship management. For instance, the suppliers in the same class are treated same although their dynamic business behaviours were very different. The purpose of re-categorizing suppliers based on real business behaviours was to adjust the existing categorization and offer suppliers with different business behaviours different relationship management strategies. We used FW-KMeans to cluster the supplier and behaviour attribute matrix. The experiment was conducted on a machine with a Pentium (R) 1.8G CPU and 512M RAM. The parameter was assigned to 1.5 and K was assigned to 60 because the number of supplier classes in the current categorization is 60. Figure 3 shows the relationships between the result clusters and the company X  X  current supplier classes. The spectrum value is the clustering results. The x-axis is the company X  X  supplier classes and the y-axis is the count of suppliers.

From the above chart, we can see that s uppliers in some existing classes were clustered into different clusters. This indicates that suppliers in the same class had very different business b ehaviors although their static information is similar.
From this figure we can observe three different types of the current supplier classes. The first type is the classes in which suppliers had similar supplying pat-terns such as class 1 and class 42. For these classes, adjustment is not needed. The second type is the classes which were merged into single clusters. This indi-cates that the current classification is two fine for the suppliers in these classes. Examples of this type are classes 9 and 12, which should be merged into one class because suppliers in these classes have similar supplying patterns. The third type of classes are those in which suppliers we re divided into different clusters, such as classes 7, 8 and 60. These classes should be divided into subclasses because suppliers with different supplying patterns should be managed differently.
This result demonstrates that some of the current supplier classes were well developed but others should be adjusted in order to better facilitate the resources of product purchases and improve the management of supplier relationship in the company. This kind of information was observed first time by the company buying staff and gave them a lot of insight in their current practice of managing suppliers.
 4.3 Validation of Cluster Analysis To validate the clustering results produced by the FW-KMeans clustering algo-rithm, we sorted suppliers on the cluster IDs and visualized the product supply-ing patterns of different clusters. Figure 4 shows part of the visualization result.
From the figure, we can clearly see that clusters 5, 40, 44 and 54 indeed had similar product supplying patterns, which implies that the clustering algorithm was effective in clustering such highly sparse data and solving the dynamic sup-plier categorization problems.

We used the weights produced by the FW-KMeans algorithm to identify the important item categories in each clust er. However, because of the special case of zero dispersion in certain features, the largest weights may identify some item categories which were not supplied by the suppliers of the cluster. In this case we ignored these item categories. Alth ough the weights for these items were large, they did not imply the semantics of the product items that we considered important. These are the items which contributed most to the semantics of the cluster so we used these items to categorize the suppliers. Figure 5 plots the weights of these items in different clusters. The horizontal axis is the index of the items and the vertical lines indicate the values of the weights. It is clear that each cluster has its own subset of key items because the lines do not have big overlapping in different clusters. Cluster 5 and cluster 54 have some overlapping because the goods supplied by two group suppliers are close to each other.
The items corresponding to the clusters are listed in Figure 6. The suppliers of cluster 5 mainly supplied deepfreeze seafood products while the suppliers of clusters 40, 44 and 54 mainly supplied canned food, inebriant and deepfreeze meat respectively. In comparison to the company X  X  current supplier classes, the supplier categorization generated by our algorithm has two merits. Firstly, it contains the buying patterns, which can be used to manage suppliers to enlarge company X  X  profits. The key rule of the supplier categorization is the item cate-gories, but the main items of a supplier may not be important to the company. Also, the importance of a supplier to the company and the importance of the company to a supplier are all buried in the buying patterns. Corresponding to the clustering results, this work can be done smoothly. Secondly, we can see from above clustering results, the item categories information is also included in our categorization. Dynamic categorization of suppliers based on business behaviors can give a clear insight to the business with suppliers, therefore being an important way to improve the supplier relationship management in a company. The data-driven method presented in this paper is an important step toward an efficient and dynamic categorization of the large number of suppliers in large organizations. We have discussed the problems of dynamic supplier categorization and demon-strated our method to use the k-means type subspace clustering algorithm to effectively cluster the high dimensional, high sparse supplier and behavior data. The results produced from a real data set have shown that the clusters produced by the algorithm are indeed useful in real business.

To use data mining techniques in supplier relationship management is still in its early stage and a lot of real busines s problems need to be identified and data mining solutions need to be developed. This work represents one step forward in this direction. Our current work is to im plement a real system to incorporate the methodology discussed in this paper to be used in real company X  X  environment.
