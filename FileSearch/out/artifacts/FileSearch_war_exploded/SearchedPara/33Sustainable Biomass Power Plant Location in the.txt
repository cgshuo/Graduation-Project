 MASSIMILIANO CATTAFI and MARCO GAVANELLI , ENDIF Universit ` a di Ferrara Although the end of fossil fuels seems postponed to a midterm future, the search for new energy sources is recently having a new boost: after decades of warnings from the environmental experts, citizens and governements start to realize that we cannot continue polluting our planet indefinitely. Nowadays the main concern is not running out of oil, but running out of air to burn it: carbon oxides are known to increase the greenhouse effect widely recognized as the main responsible for climate change. As former OPEC minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani said,  X  X he Stone Age did not come to an end because we had a lack of stones, and the oil age will not come to an end because wehavealackofoil. X 
In the search for reducing carbon oxides emissions, biomass-powered power plants are very promising, because they provide energy with a carbon-neutral process. Biomass comes from trees and vegetables that in their life converted carbon dioxide to oxygen, and burning them simply returns part of the energy they got from sunlight, so it gives a renewable type of energy. Also, for countries that mainly rely on imported energy, biomass power may mean an economy less dependant on the price of oil. For these reasons, energy from biomass is currently receiving substantial governmental funding.

On the other hand, unluckily, building a biomass plant does not necessarily imply any improved sustainability, as the plant is inserted into an environment with complex interrelations, including production of fumes, the need for refrigeration, transport of the biomass from the production sites to the power plant, and so on. Without taking into consideration such aspects, the project is quickly doomed to failure.
Even more importantly, there are economic aspects that rule the whole life of the biomass plant. For example, in Italy energy producers that use renewable sources have the right to sell energy to the energy provider (ENEL) at a price higher than the market price [CIP6 1992]. Since energy selling price is higher than the market price, the plant manager can afford to buy biomasses at higher prices than the market price. This helps the development of new renewable power plants, but on the other hand may lure the manager to produce energy with low-cost fuel, like palm-tree oil imported from over-seas. Unfortunately, the energy needed to transport the fuel overseas is much higher than the energy actually produced by burning it in the biomass plant. Nevertheless, it gives good revenue to the plant manager. However, even excluding these extreme situations, it may actually happen that the transport of the biomass to the plant consumes more energy than that produced in the plant. Again, the reason is economic: the producers of biomass may be lured by the high revenues to carry biomass from far-away production sites, or with highly polluting and/or energy-demanding trucks.
One of the issues is the combinatorial nature of the problem. A good location of the biomass plant is of vital importance for the economic survival of the project, and it includes solving complex location and transportation problems. Many works in the literature deal with this aspect [Freppaz et al. 2003; Bruglieri and Liberti 2008, Reche-L  X  opez et al. 2009].

The second issue is the sustainability of the project, and this is affected by more subtle aspects. In this work, we explicitly address the biomass plant location problem with the aim of maximizing the sustainability, starting from real-world data gathered in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy.

This work is only a part of a wider picture: we aim at developing a decision support and optimization tool for the Emilia Romagna regional planning and its strategic environmental assessment. The biomass plant location is an important aspect to be taken into account in regional planning. The tool proposed in this article helps both the regional planning and its strategic environmental assessment by defining the optimal sustainable biomass provisioning basin and by assessing already installed plants. Before going into the details of the specific biomass power plant location problem, we contextualize it in the wider picture. The energy-and cost-efficient biomass plant optimal location proposed in this article is just a small part of a wider picture whose long-term goal is the design and imple-mentation of decision support and optimization tools for the regional planning and its Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). It involves problems related to a number of different yet correlated areas as shown in Figure 1. A comprehensive decision support system for regional planning and SEA should be able to optimize decisions in all these fields while at the moment only qualitative aspects are considered and manually evaluated.

Regional planning is the science of efficient placement of land use activities and infrastructures for the sustainable growth of a region. Regional plans are classified into types ; the SEA is legally required for eleven types of plans (namely Agriculture, Forest, Fishing, Energy, Industry, Transport, Waste, Water, Telecommunication, Tourism, Urban, and Environmental plans). Each plan defines activities that should be carried out during the plan implementation. Activities are roughly divided into six types: infrastructures and plants; buildings and land use transformations; resource ex-traction; modifications of hydraulic regime; industrial transformations; environmental management.

Before any implementation, these plans have to be environmentally assessed, under the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive . SEA is a method for incorporating environmental considerations into policies, plans, and programs, and it is prescribed by the European Union policy.

The importance of applying decision support systems to regional planning derives from the huge economic and environmental impact that wrong decisions could have. One of the instruments used for assessing a regional plan in Emilia Romagna are the so-called coaxial matrices , that are a development of the network method [Sorensen and Moss 1973]. They define dependencies between the activities contained in a plan and positive and negative impacts (also called pressures ) on the environment and the dependencies between the impacts and environmental receptors. A plan basically defines the so-called magnitude of each activity.

The coaxial matrices are currently used by environmental experts that manually evaluate a single, already defined, plan . A manual evaluation of alternatives and what-if queries are very difficult to consider. In addition, planning is now carried out without a rigorous consideration of environmental aspects contained in the coaxial matrices.
Our aim is to design and implement a decision support and optimization tool for the strategic environmental assessment and for the regional planning. For this purpose, we have developed a logic-based system [Gavanelli et al. 2010] that embeds the coax-ial matrices; the system can be used both by the environmental expert to assess an already defined plan, and by the politicians to evaluate different scenarios and opti-mize regional planning decisions. The current environmental assessment is based on qualitative measures of the impact on environmental receptors.

A more in-depth insight on quantitative measures would be extremely helpful to build and assess a regional plan. For example, in the energy plan the environmental expert finds information of this kind: two biomass power plants are planned to be built in the next two years. On the basis of this high-level information, only a rough expected impact on environmental receptors can be computed. If the decision support system linked to the SEA enables the planner and the environmental expert to optimally locate the power plant so as to minimize the environmental negative pressure, the coaxial matrices can be populated with precise data and the environmental assessment becomes more transparent.

In this article we describe the design and implementation of one component of the overall quantitative regional planning and SEA picture. This component is an opti-mization tool which is able to find the optimal energy-efficient biomass plant location, together with corresponding biomass provisioning plan. It can also be used to evaluate existing plants/provisioning plans with respect to their energy balance. In addition, the tool can help in deciding whether or not to open a biomass power plant in a given location (possibly converting an old industrial infrastructure to a biomass power plant). All these activities are inserted in the wider frame of the quantitative Strategic Environmental Assessment that is subject of current research.

The rest of the article is organized as follows. We first define the problem, and show the collected data from the Emilia-Romagna region. Then, in Section 3, we define a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that optimally locates one or more biomass power plants in a devised area of the region, optimizing in particular the ecological sustainability of the project. In Section 4 we study the complexity of the problem. We show the results obtained from the MILP model in Section 5. We discuss related work in Section 6 and conclude with Section 7. Biomass power plants may be aimed at obtaining energy from a variety of different fuels: from garbage, to forest/sawmill residues, to manure [Thomas 2008]. In this work, we address the problem of the optimal location of a biomass plant that uses wood ob-tained from forests. This does not mean deforestation, as wood can come from dead trees, branches, tree stumps, etc., as well as from selection cutting , that is the practice of removing mature timber to improve the timber stand. In sustainable forest man-agement, a selection cutting criterion requires to cut less than the yearly produced biomass.

Before building a power plant, one should get the required authorizations from the regional bureaus. As stated earlier, this includes an evaluation of the environmental impact of the power plant. Various locations are not acceptable for a power plant, due to various reasons that come from geological information, regulations, statistics on pollution, types of crops in the surrounding fields, etc. Other locations could be acceptable but raise some issues that need further investigation before the project can be accepted.

To define disallowed areas, and areas requiring further investigations, the envi-ronmental experts of the Emilia-Romagna region reported into a table the possible interferences between various types of power plants with sensitivity themes ,thatis, types of areas that may be sensitive to such a plant. Table I is an excerpt of such a table.

For each theme, the required information are gathered into a map, given as a shape-file of a Geographical Information System (GIS). Shapefiles can include points, line segments, or polygons representing areas with common characteristics. Through a GIS software, one can overlap shapefiles as layers of a map. In this way, by overlap-ping all the maps of themes incompatible with some power plant type, the map of incompatibility for a given plant type can be generated: it is the set of areas in which there is at least one layer (theme) that forbids such plant (see Figure 2). From this process a set of feasible locations is identified.
 We consider the problem of locating a plant that uses biomass obtained from forests. Biomass is then transported to the power plant; we suppose that the transport is through roads. The regional agency kindly provided us with the GIS map of roads as well as the shapefile of forests. The shapefile of roads is a set of line segments: each road segment is a straight line segment connecting two points, given with longitude and latitude. A road is then a sequence of segments; the length of each segment is between 6 and 20 metres.

We built a graph containing as nodes all points from the roads X  shapefile. Two nodes are connected if there is a straight road segment connecting the two.

We assume that the biomass plants will be built in close proximity to some road, and that biomass is collected near a road, to allow for a convenient transportation of biomass material from the collection point to the plant. In our model, only the nodes of the obtained graph are possible biomass plant locations. On the other hand, there is no point in selecting the actual positioning with a precision of 20 metres, so we use a sampling of the nodes based on proximity.

In the graph, each node is labeled as red if the node is internal in a polygon incom-patible with biomass plants, it is green if it is a biomass collection point, it is white otherwise. Each arc is labeled with its length. Thus, candidate positions for the power plants are the white nodes, biomass is collected at green nodes, and transported to the power plants by following paths in the graph.

In the following, we propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to address the plant location problem. The MILP model used to address the given problem relies on a problem representation given as a graph. Starting from the general graph described earlier, we produce a smaller bipartite graph that connects possible locations of the biomass power plants to the location of the forests. Each arc is labeled with the shortest path length between the two nodes; the (shortest path) distance between two nodes i and j is called d ij ,and it is a parameter (it is a known constant).

We have an array of unknowns P that represents the possible locations of the plants: the element p i can be 0 or 1; it is 1 iff we build a power plant in node i . We suppose we want to build in the devised region a number of plants which belongs to the fixed range Min p to Max p ; we ensure this fact through the constraint
We also have N F forest nodes, that is, nodes from which the owners can collect wood that can be used to produce energy in the biomass plant. As said earlier, wood can come from forest residues (such as dead trees, branches, tree stumps, etc.) or from selection cutting . Each forest node i has a production of wood prod i that cannot be exceeded, because the quantity of wood removed from a region should not exceed the yearly produced biomass, in order to have a sustainable process. We have a matrix of unknowns C ij that links power plant nodes with forest nodes. Element C ij gives the quantity of wood that is provided from forest node i to plant node j . The constraints include that the total quantity of wood provided by a forest node i does not exceed its carry capacity:
Each power plant has a minimal quantity of wood mindemand it must receive in order to be operative; otherwise there is no point in installing such a plant.
Symmetrically, there is a maximum quantity of wood a power plant can accept: Note that this constraint also imposes that one cannot provide wood to a plant that is not installed.
 Finally, we have economic parameters and sustainability parameters.

We assume that owners can collect residual wood from the nearby forests, and will transport them to one plant (usually the closest one), in exchange for money. Now, if the revenue is lower than the supply cost, then there will be no deal, so we need to take into account two important parameters: the unit price paid for the wood, Price w ood , and the unit supply cost. The supply cost for the forest owner includes a collection cost and a transport cost. We assume the collection cost is proportional to the quantity of collected wood (although it could depend on many factors, like slope and extension of the wood). For the transport cost, we consider a parameter Cost trans , that represents the cost of transporting one unit of wood for a distance of one unit. So, we have that plant j can receive wood from forest node i only if it is economically advantageous to collect and transport wood from i to j . The transport cost is proportional to the quantity and to the distance through constant Cost trans , that is, the cost to transport a quantity C ij from node i to node j is so the supply cost becomes The revenue for the seller of wood is proportional to the quantity, so if she provides C ij units of wood, she will get a revenue of from which she expects some minimum profit for example, we can have that Profit w ood = 0 . 2  X  Price w ood : it is a constant parameter explaining that the seller will not sell the biomass if her profit is below 20% the total price of the biomass. Combining Eqs. (3), (4), and (5) we get that the net revenue is acceptable iff is satisfied. If it is not, then we impose that C ij = 0.

From a sustainability viewpoint, the aim is that the whole system generated by the new plant produces renewable energy (at the net of consumed energy). The system contains the plant, as well as the forest owners collecting wood and transporting it to the plant, so we must ensure that the energy spent for the transport and for building the plant does not overpass that produced by the wood in the plant.

The wood transport is usually performed by means of some vehicle of the wood provider, which can be efficient or not. We fix an average efficiency parameter, and call E fuel the energy provided by the fuel necessary to move one unit of wood for one distance unit. On the other hand, we have that one unit of wood provides energy E w ood . Also, we have to consider that building a plant requires itself an energy investment, and such aspect should be taken into account in the energy balance: we will consider this contribute in a term  X  , that will be detailed in the following. Thus the objective function considering transportation and sustainability issues is The energy required to build a new plant depends mainly on its location and its size. The contribution for the location can be considered as a coefficient  X  i associated to each node i  X  X  1 .. N P } in the graph that is candidate to host a plant. The size of the plant can be given, for example, in terms of its input power. In our case, the power the plant gets as input is the energy of biomass it receives divided by the time the plant is operative: The relation between the size of the plant and the energy required to build it, as reported in the documents of the European Commission [2006], is given by where E 0 is the energy required to build a plant of reference size P 0 (in some location with  X  = 1). The scale factor s goes usually from 0.5 to 1. Clearly, in the extreme case of s = 1 we have a linear relation: building two plants of 1MW or one plant of 2MW has exactly the same energy requirement 1 ; instead, when s &lt; 1 we can exploit economy of scale for the plant. So, knowing the energy E 0 required to build a plant of size P 0 ,the energy required to build a plant in node j is given by the nonlinear relation
Eq. (7) provides the total energy required to build a new plant in node j . Such energy should be considered in the objective function, as we want the whole system to produce energy; however, the other terms in Eq. (6) represent the produced energy and the cost of transport per year , so to add up the two terms we need to amortize the total energy E during the lifespan of the plant. We simply divide E j for the average number of years a plant is productive, T life j , and obtain as new objective function.
Such objective function is nonlinear and, since the exponent s is at most 1, the term in Eq. (7) is concave (whenever s &lt; 1).

In order to fit the nonlinear function in the MILP model, we approximate it with a piecewise linear function.

Given a (possibly nonlinear) function y = g ( x ), we sample the curve g in k points x ,..., x where  X  i  X  [0 .. 1] are new continuous variables subject to the constraints. Clearly the last two conditions are not linear; they can be stated in a MILP model introducing new integer 0-1 variables, but there exists a more efficient option. In many MILP solvers, one can declare (  X  1 ,..., X  k ) as a Special Order Set of type 2 (SOS2) [Beale and Tomlin 1970], and the solver will exploit this information for efficient branching heuristics.

It should be noticed that, for the sake of sustainability, the problem cannot be just formulated under an economical point of view, as the market prices of biomass and fuel needed for transportation do not reflect the respective energy potential. This is caused by a number of reasons, the most relevant of which is that institutions such as the European Union or the regional government issue economical incentives for the use of the former (e.g., trying to push entrepreneurs towards renewable energy). For this reason it is possible that the economic net revenue for the plant is positive even if the whole system, including the transport chain and all the rest which is needed in order to make the plant work, actually consumes energy at the net. We show that the problem addressed in this article is NP-hard, even in the case in which there are no restrictions on the plants X  capacity.

A Facility Location Problem is defined as the 4-tuple D , F , f , d , where  X  D is a set of clients  X  F is a set of potential facility locations  X  d is a function d : D  X  F  X  R + representing the distance between clients and possible facility locations  X  f isafunction f : F  X  R + representing the cost of opening a new facility. The objective is to find the set S  X  F that minimizes
Given an instance of the facility location, we build the following biomass plant loca-tion problem:  X  X he set of forest nodes is equal to the set of clients D  X  X he possible positions of the biomass plant are the potential facility locations  X  X he energy required to build a plant is independent of the size of the plant ( s = 0)  X  X he cost of opening a new biomass plant coincides with function f f i =  X  j E 0  X  X he distance between forest and plant nodes coincides with the distance function d  X  X he number of plants is not constrained ( Min p = 0and Max p =| F | )  X  X ll forest nodes produce a unit of biomass (  X  i  X  X  1 .. N F } , prod i = 1)  X  Cost collect = 0, Cost trans = 0, Price w ood is any number greater than zero  X  X he biomass plant does not have (constraining) minimum and maximum capacity ( mindemand = 0, maxdemand = N F i = 1 prod i )
Now, we decompose the objective function (8) into the terms. The first term is the same as in Eq. (9). From the definition of E w ood , we have that the are no limits on the capacity of a plant, all the available biomass can be collected, so in an optimal solution of the biomass plant placement problem the second term is the con-that the optimal solution of the biomass plant placement problem provides an optimal solution of the Facility Location Problem, if every forest node provides biomass only to one plant.

Let us suppose that, in the optimal solution of the biomass plant placement problem, one forest node i provides biomass to two plants, let us call them j 1 and j 2 . In this case, the two plants must be at the same distance from node i ( d ij all the biomass could be carried to the closest facility (as we do not have capacity con-straints), providing a better value of the objective function (which contradicts the fact that such solution is optimal). Since the two plants are at the same distance, we can move all the available biomass to one of them, say j 1 , without changing the value of the objective function. We can apply this method to all forest nodes that serve more than one plant and obtain an optimal solution of the Facility Location Problem. We experimented with our MILP model on two subregions of the Emilia-Romagna region, delimited by rectangles in Figure 3.

In Figures 4 and 5 the detailed views are shown of, respectively, the western and eastern areas, with the available roads (the main roads are thicker), the forest areas (solid filled surfaces), and areas where biomass plant location is impossible (hatched).
The two areas were selected with different characteristics in order to study our approach in different scenarios. The western area has large availability of forests, and it is wider than the eastern area; this area could support the presence of many power plants, which can make the problem difficult to solve computationally. The eastern area is more restricted, and it contains less forest nodes, so in this case transport issues are particularly relevant, as biomass may have to be collected from many dispersed forests. We ran a series of experiments on those areas.

In Figures 4 and 5 results are shown of optimal placement without considering energy cost of plant construction. The squares are the optimal placements of plants found by the model and the different sizes show the associated biomass demand and energy production. In Figure 5 the spot on one of the forest areas shows, for example, one of the biomass supply points associated to the linked plant in the optimal provisioning plan, while the cross shows the placement of one plant as prescribed by the solution obtained choosing as the objective function the maximization of profit rather than the energy balance.

In both areas the goal was to place a number of plants not greater than 5 and whose production had to be more than 0.2 MW but less than 1 MW (thus adopting the point of view of distributed power generation).

The considered values for energy parameters are E w ood = 15000 MJ / tonne for biomass and E fuel = 7 MJ / km for fuel (we are considering fuel consumption being 0.1 lt/km for a load of one tonne). The market price for biomass has beed set to Price w ood = 30 euros / tonne , and collection cost to Cost collect = 25 euros / tonne .Weas-sume the biomass seller accepts as a minimum profit 15% of Price w ood ( Profit w ood = 4 . 5 euros ) for selling biomass and Cost trans = 0 . 2 euros / km . All these parameters are, of course, affected by some variability: different kinds of wood have different E w ood , fuel consumption and E fuel depend on the means of transport (small vans, big trucks, tractors, etc.), the collection cost depends on the characteristics of the collection area, and the price of biomass and the expected profit follow market dynamics. All the values of the parameters were estimated by the environmental experts of the regional agency, based on their experience in the environmental impact evaluation and, whenever pos-sible, on officially available data. For parameters with high variability they suggested to take the average value.

The western area is mapped on approximately 300 nodes, while the eastern counts approximately 100. Results were obtained in 10 minutes in the former case and 5 seconds in the latter one, using a 2 GHz Core 2 Duo processor.

The total net energy produced by the plants in the two optimal configurations is respectively 88500 GJ and and 16800 GJ for the western and eastern areas, while the total energy necessary for the transportation of the biomass to the power plant is respectively 96133 MJ and 4707 MJ. In both cases, the net produced energy is positive, which shows that the optimal placement reached its objective. On the other hand, when choosing to maximize the profit in the eastern area, while the produced energy is the same, the energy necessary for the transportation of the biomass rises to 16793 MJ so while the energy balance keeps being positive, it is less favorable.

In Figures 6 and 7 results of placement are shown considering also the energy investment for plant construction. The environmental experts of the regional agency suggested that, in order to build a reference plant of P 0 = 0 . 5 MW the required energy is
E 0 = 45 TJ ; the exponent in Eq. (7) has value s = 0 . 8, and the average lifetime of a plant is T life = 25 years. The total net energy produced by the plants in the two optimal configurations is, respectively, 78995 GJ and and 14858 GJ for the western and eastern areas.

It is interesting to study the total net energy produced by the whole system varying the number of biomass power plants. In Figure 8, we show the results for the eastern area. After a sharp rise of the curve, due to the fact that only one plant cannot use all the available biomass, the curve decreases slowly, with an optimum number of plants equal to 2. This effect shows that there are opportunities given by economies of scale: the configuration with two plants (including a bigger one) is more rewarding than building 5 small ones. It is worth noting that with a coarser model, that does not consider the nonlinearities in Eq. (7), such effect would not appear.

However, it is worth noting that the production of energy, and, as a consequence, the sustainability of the defined choice, depends on the value of the parameters. As said ear-lier, we took average values provided by the experts for the transport cost Cost trans ,the energy generated by the fuel E fuel , as well as the price and energy for biomass (respec-tively, Price w ood and E w ood ); however, we know that the price of fuel has high variability that depends on the market, the rising demand of developing countries, the taxation level, etc. The energy of fuel is more stable, but still it depends on the type of fuel available in the devised area, and in the Emilia-Romagna region there are at least four types of widely distributed fuels (petrol, diesel fuel, methane, and propane). We wanted to assess the sustainability of the power plant and its provisioning system, and find out if, for some combinations of the parameters, the sustainability of the system drops.
In Figure 9, we show the variation of the net energy production varying the other parameters computed in the eastern area. It emerges that the important parameters are actually the ratios between the parameters. The biomass/fuel cost ratio expresses the relation between the biomass price the plant manager pays for one load of biomass ( Price w ood ), and the transport cost for one unit of length ( Cost trans ). The biomass/fuel energy ratio expresses the relation between the energy potential contained in one load of biomass ( E w ood ) and the energy used to transport the biomass for one unit of length ( E fuel ).

In the abscissa of the graph of Figure 9, we have the ratio Price w ood / Cost trans .Higher prices for biomass allow forest owners to collect biomass not only from the very close woods but also from some more distant ones, thus influencing in a positive way the objective function at the beginning. In fact, Figure 9 shows that the net produced energy initially increases as the ratio Price w ood / Cost trans grows. However, at some point a saturation occurs that can be due to various factors: for instance, the limit on the total power production may be reached (maximum number of plants times the maximum energy produced by each plant).

On the z axis the ratio between energies E w ood / E fuel is plotted; we have fixed the energy produced by biomass E w ood and varied the E fuel energy necessary to transport a unit of biomass for a unit of distance. In this way, we can take into account both different types of fuel and different types of transport media (e.g., small or big trucks) with varying efficiency (e.g., with old or new engine types). As expected, reducing the energy required for transportation increases the net produced energy up to a saturation and, vice versa, the increase in the amount of energy used to transport one load of biomass causes a decrease in the maximum net energy that can be produced. It is worth noting that there is a threshold in which the system as a whole starts consuming energy, instead of producing it. Note, however, that sometimes even if the net produced energy is negative, the net revenue for the various actors (the plant management and the forest owners) is not zero: the system consumes energy but still produces money . This is the worst possible situation from a sustainability viewpoint: the biomass plant pollutes the local region with fumes and, at the same time, it consumes energy.

But there is also an even worse risk, much more subtle: if the environmental assess-ment of the plant (and, most importantly, of the whole system) is done after building the plant, workers will become frustrated, and stakeholders will think that investing in the green economy is futile.

It is of utmost importance to identify these possible situations as early as possible, before the plants are built, and local authorities should intervene before the required authorizations are given. During the environmental assessment (see Section 1.1) these possible problems should be identified, possibly with an expert system to support decisions. This work should be seen as one of the various elements in the wider picture of strategic environmental assessment. The problem of biomass power plant location is widely investigated in the literature with the aim of defining optimal positioning with respect to economic aspects.
Bruglieri and Liberti [2008] study the problem of running and planning a biomass-based production process. The aim is to optimize a process in which various plants process material and exchange the products. For example, there can be a fermenta-tion/distillation plant taking as input cane or beetroots and providing as output some type of alcohol, that can be input for another plant. In the optimization of running of the biomass-based process, the authors suppose a fixed amount of various output commodities is required, and minimize the operation costs (i.e., the cost of supplying plants with input commodities, transportation costs, and processing costs). The authors also consider the planning of the production process, that includes deciding where and what type of processing plants one should install in various available locations. Our aim is more on the sustainability aspects rather than on the economic ones. Our model includes the energy required for building the power plant, that is approximated with a piecewise linear function of the plant capacity.
 Reche-L  X  opez et al. [2009] consider the problem of placing a biomass power plant. They compare various metaheuristics (Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms, and Particle Swarm Optimization) to find a near-optimal positioning of the biomass plant. They consider only economic factors to decide the biomass plant placement, that is, their objective is to find the placement that gives maximum revenue. Another incomplete iterative GIS-based approach for the identification of candidate power plants is described in Voivontas et al. [2001]. It identifies possible restrictions to the biomass power plant location and iteratively identifies potential locations along with the cultivated areas needed for the biomass collection. In this article, we adopted a complete approach that provides a provably optimal solution, while Reche-L  X  opez et al. compare metaheuristics that may provide suboptimal solutions.

Other approaches [Mitchell 1995; Mitchell et al. 1995] make use of a spreadsheet model to support decisions in the coppice harvesting, storage, and transport and to model the costs related to the growing short rotation coppices in U.K. (coppicing is a method of woodland management which takes advantage of the fact that some trees reshoot from the stump or roots if cut down). These approaches converged in Mitchell [2000] in a comprehensive decision support system based on spreadsheet model for the bio-energy assessment.

An approach making use of a sophisticated MILP model is described in Freppaz et al. [2003]. Similarly to our approach a Geographic Information System integrated with an Integer Linear Programming model is used. Differently from our approach, the one presented in Freppaz et al. [2003] relies on an objective function that esti-mates the economic costs-benefit balance related to the power plant; the benefit de-rives from the sale of the produced energy, while the costs include the cost of plant installation/maintainance, the transportation cost, the biomass harvesting cost, and the energy distribution cost. Clearly, energy efficiency is not considered while it is an essential aspect in sustainable biomass power plants. Related to the latter, also Nagel [2000b] makes use of a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model for the definition of an economic energy supply structure based on biomass. The model has been tested in the state of Brandeburg, Germany in Nagel [2000a]. None of these works considers the (nonlinear) function that relates the size of the plant with the energy required to build it, while we approximate it with a piecewise linear function.

Simulation and optimization are compared by De Mol et al. [1997] on the biomass logistic-related problems. The aim is to define the location of the biomass plant along with biomass pretreatment sites. The optimization model is divided into three com-ponents each associated to a type of biomass that are then combined in a knapsack model. The objective function is again the minimization of costs of biomass flow (vari-able costs) and those related to pretreatment (fixed costs). Again, energy efficiency is not considered, nor the nonlinear relation defining the energy required for building the plant.

As explained earlier in this article, it may be the case that the revenue is positive even if the system is not sustainable, and it actually consumes energy instead of producing it; for this reason, we adopted a sustainability viewpoint that optimizes the net produced energy. We agree that economic factors should not be overlooked, and we explicitly considered the budget of the forest owners.

Another important contribution of this article with respect to related literature concerns the wider aim of the overall decision support system. It is the first time, to our knowledge, that an effort is done to collect in a unique decision support system all aspects of the strategic environmental assessment along with the corresponding optimization problems. Among these problems biomass location is an important cornerstone.

The formulation of our problem is related to the Facility Location Problem, for which there exists a wide literature on the basic models and algorithms [Kuehn and Hamburger 1963; Balinski 1965; Khumawala 1972; Erlenkotter 1978; Geoffrion and McBride 1978], as well as surveys [Aikens 1985; Brandeau and Chiu 1989; ReVelle and Laporte 1996; Owen and Daskin 1998; Klose and Drexl 2005] and books [Daskin 1995; Sule 2001; Drezner and Hamacher 2002; Farahani and Hekmatfar 2009].

One of the differences in our model with respect to the classical facility location problem stands in the fact that not all clients must be served. Charikar et al. [2001] study various extensions of the facility location in which a small number of clients can be denied service, in order to obtain a reduction of the total cost. In particular, when there is a small number of outliers, the cost reduction can be significant. The authors propose various extensions that can be grouped into two main categories. The robust facility location has a fixed parameter p that represents the number of clients that must be serviced; the classical facility location problem can be obtained by setting p equal to the number n of clients. The facility location with penalties associates each client j with a penalty p j : for each client that does not receive the service, the objective function gets the corresponding penalty. Again, the classical facility location problem can be obtained by setting all penalties to  X  . The authors propose polynomial approximation algorithms for these cases.

Brimberg and ReVelle [1998] address the problem as a biobjective problem: the first objective is minimizing the costs, while the second is minimizing the unsatisfied de-mand. They find the efficient frontier with the weighting method, that is, they optimize a weighted sum of the two objectives and then vary the weights to find all the frontier.
In our formulation, if a forest node j does not provide biomass to any plant, the objective function implicitly incurs in a penalty corresponding to its production capa-bilities prod j  X  E w ood , so our problem could be cast as a facility location with penalties (if the opening cost of each plant was independent of the plant size and there were no upper/lower limits on the plant size).

Holmberg and Lin [1997] consider a variant of the facility location problem in which the cost of a facility depends on the size of the plant through a staircase function; they also propose heuristics based on Lagrangean relaxation. Wollenweber [2008] proposes a number of further extensions to such a model and proposes a heuristic approach. Instead of the staircase, we used a continuous piecewise linear approximation of the energetic cost of opening a biomass plant; moreover, our model does not require all clients to be served. Environmental planning is a delicate area where decision support systems can be important tools in order to allocate resources, for example, economical incentives, giving a real contribution to the intended strategic objectives and avoiding to adopt policies which, apparently promising, do not tend in practice to the expected goals. As a part of a bigger project oriented to sustainability, we devised, implemented, and tested an optimization tool which addresses the biomass power plant placement problem, in a collaboration between computer science engineers and environmental experts.
Our aim was to produce a constraint model maximizing the environmental sustain-ability of the power plant, but without forgetting economic factors that could doom the project to failure. We optimized the net energy produced by the whole system, which includes, beside the plant, the collection and transport of biomass to the plant.
In future work, we plan to collect further feedback from operators in the area, we intend to extend and refine the model, customizing it for the various territorial peculiar-ities. We plan to capture the various points of view (e.g., normative) that environmental agencies face.

Finally, in this work we focused on just one type of fuel for biomass-powered power plants, namely wood residues coming from forests. Biomass can also come from crops, garbage, or even from manure. It is worth investigating if biomass plants powered with other types of fuel can be optimized with the tools of computational sustainability.
An important extension will be considering further economic issues. For example, in the current work we assumed that each forest node has a different owner, while it can be the case that a single owner has availability of more than one forest. This could have important effects, since an owner could have an advantage in providing biomass to a plant from an unprofitable source, in order to ensure the plant being built, so that other forest nodes in her availability could provide biomass with high profits for her. Indeed, such situations could further increase the issue of sustainability, as unprofitable sources could be far away from the plant, and the transportation of the biomass could have very high energy requirements. We plan to study the issue in future research by enclosing in our model the information about ownership of the forests.
