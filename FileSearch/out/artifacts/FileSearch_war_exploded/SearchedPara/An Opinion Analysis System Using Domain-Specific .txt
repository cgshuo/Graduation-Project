 Gathering opinions about a specific subject is important in many areas such as gov-ernments to improve their services [1]. Since people often express their thoughts on articles, newspaper is one of the good resources where opinions of various sorts are found. Especially, in the economy domain, opinions about economic events flood into news. Sentiment information (e.g., negative or positive tendency) can be a reflection of people X  X  opinions for a specific subject. Our research is motivated by this and cen-tered around sentiment analysis of news articles on economy. More precisely, we attempt to build a system that determines the polarity of sentiment and its strength. 
Previously, researchers have used a statistical learning method and semantically oriented seed terms as clues. Pang et al [2] adopted supervised machine learners to predict a document X  X  semantic polarity. Ku et al [3] attempted to develop opinion extraction, summarization and tracking systems. Hatzivassiloglou [6] have attempted to predict semantic orientation of adjectives by analyzing adjective pairs. Turney [7] have bootstrapped from a seed set 1 . Kamps et al [8] have focused on the use of lexical relations defined in WordNet. Esuli [5] proposed semi-supervised learning method started from expanding Turney X  X  seed set. Bradley [4] tried psychological studies which have found measurable associations between words and human emotions. 
Following the same line of thought, we take a novel approach that considers do-main-specific lexical knowledge to complement generic methods entirely relying on statistical learning. In particular, we built an opinion analysis (OA) system for Korean economic news. Instead of constructing a costly deep knowledge base (KB) in the domain, we collected a set of domain-specific terms that indicate sentiments of an article in the domain. We postulate that domain knowledge is critical because a priori knowledge on semantic orientation of domain-specific terms complements statistical learning methods. The KB contains sentiment information of economy terms such as  X   X  X  X   X  (a reduction of capitals) and general sentiment clues such as  X   X  X   X  (falling). 
In order to test our hypothesis that domain-specific lexicon should improve the per-formance of sentiment analysis, we evaluated our system using Korean economic news. The system consists of a KB that contains information about domain specific terms as well as domain independent terms that express sentiments, agent architecture for crawling news articles and determines their sentiments using the knowledge base, and an information retrieval (IR) system that enables end-users to capture the senti-ment tendency of an interesting topic. In order to simulate an operational environ-ment, for which this system was envisioned to begin with, about 170,000 news docu-ments were collected initially. We ran experiments using topic-specific 200 articles of the collection to test our system X  X  effectiveness. In our system, the KB is a core according to our hypothesis. The lack of machine-readable knowledge in the economy domain drove us to gather sentiment knowledge manually. We employed 5 annotators, who were majoring in economics. They anno-tated semantic orientation and its strength for a given term, based on its perceived role in determining sentiments in the domain. They were instructed to make judgments in view of the Korean economy. For example,  X   X  X   X  X  X  (liability account) X  is consid-ered strongly negative since it has a negative effect on the Korean economy. 
Our assumption is that some economy terms have polarity values and degrees of strengths. Several well-known dictionaries 2 in economy domain were the main source. In addition, non-economy terms (context terms) that influence the economy were collected. For example,  X   X  X  X   X   X  X  X   X  (North Korea X  X  nuclear test) in news severely affects the economy as witnessed by North Korean X  X  announcement of their success in underground nuclear test last year, which shook South Korea X  X  stock market. 
We also gathered words that frequently carry sentiment information in news be-cause generally the sentiment often depends on an occurrence of seed words such as  X   X  X  X   X  (denounce). These domain-independent words have some clues as to the polar-ity of text containing them. Our annotators extracted those terms from a randomly selected 300 sample articles from the collection of news articles collected during a month. All the collected terms were annotated, resulting in 13,564 dictionary terms, 620 context terms, and 176 general words. The annotation process was as follows. First, the annotator selected a term X  X  polarity: positive, negative, or neutral. Next, obvious, the annotator was allowed to choose  X  X eutral. X  We designed the scale of 1 to found many cases with disagreement among the annotators. For examples,  X 1  X   X  X   X  (January Effect) was judged as two positives, two negatives, and one neural. For the cases with disagreements, we decided a term X  X  semantic orientation by majority (i.e., counting voting results and selecting the most one) and the term X  X  strength by the average of the selected polarity voters X  strength values. When two or less annotators viewed a term as either positive or negative, we set it to be a neutral term. Therefore, we gathered 4043 dictionary terms, 531 context terms, and 176 general words which final results: the number of positive and negative terms with different strengths. Annotator Weak Mild Strong Weak Mild Strong Our system determines a news article X  X  sentiment information for end-users who want to read an opinionated news article on a specific topic, sometime with an interest on a particular sentiment. Due to an enormous number of daily news data, swiftness is an essential in our system. So, firstly, an agent 3 collects news documents from news wires. Next, another agent detects sentiment terms in KB and reacts to determine the sentiment of news in the background of the scoring formula, paragraph segmentation and morphological analysis 4 . After that, the news documents sentiment information are tagged are transferred to IR system [10]. As a result, news articles with sentiment information are viewed by IR system. Also, a document X  X  sentiment value, v is deter-mined in Figure 1. For each term ( tc ) in a document ( D ), the formula averages all the detected terms by each term X  X  frequency ( f ( tc )) and each term X  X  sentiment value important sentiment factor. (In experiment,  X  is 0.4,  X  is 0.6). Also, we promoted one step for sentiment words in the first para graph as like  X  X eakly positive X  to  X  X ildly positive X , which reflects the writing style that topics are arranged at the top. Our collection covers 21 different newswire sources from July of 2005 to November of 2006. Among them, we tested the documents retrieved within top-200 based on two queries,  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X   X  (government X  X  real estate policy) and  X   X  X  X   X  X  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X   X  X   X  (arrest of Jung Mong Jun, President of Hyundai automobile company). Our goal of the experiments was testing two hypotheses: 1) our approach can complement the statistically based approach to OA; 2) our KB containing do-main-specific lexical knowledge is useful in determining the polarity and the strength of news article. We assumed an information seeking scenario wher e a user wanting to get a feeling about the most sensational news in economy enters a query like the above query and reads the retrieved news articles. First, we measured the accuracy of the polarity determination function using three classes: negative, positive, and neutral. Second, we examined the sentiment strength determination function in terms of accu-racy and the Mean-Squared Error (MSE) that can capture the problem of the huge distinction between the true strength and the predicted strength. If t i is the true strength of document i , and p i is the predicted strength of document i, where n is the number of documents in the test set. We obtained the results of strengths at the 3-step level (i.e., weak, mild, and strong) and 5-step level (i.e., 1~5). 
For the gold-standard, we decided the polarities and their strength of the test articles by majority as used in Section 3. To verify our system X  X  competitiveness over statisti-cal learning methods, we produced results of SVM and Na X ve Bayes-based classifiers as the baseline. Those classifiers using uni-gram feature were trained by another 100 retrieved documents with the same queries (i.e., we searched another 100 samples and annotated them in the same manner as in the test set). Pang et al [2] report that SVM has the best performance in English text. In spite of the belief that adjective is more effective contributor than other parts-of-speech in classifying English documents based on their sentiment values [5, 6], noun is a much more critical feature in Korean text (Table 4). We used Joachim X  X  SVM light package [9]. 
We obtained 74% accuracy which is 9% increase over the better baseline perform-ance and 30% increase over the case where only the general KB was used. Since the terms in KB are only nouns, adjective was not encountered in the cases of KB. We observed, at least in Korean news, that domain specific terms play a more important role in determining the sentiment because the context of words provide additional information in capturing more precise sentim ent. For example, general words such as  X   X  X  X  (decrease) X  that may be considered as ne gative in many context have different meanings depending on its context. For example,  X   X  X  X   X  X   X  X  X  (decrease of the 
KB with only general 
KB with only general selling price of an apartment) X  is positive, but  X   X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  (decrease of the interest for real-estate loans) X  is negative since it may cause land speculation. To resolve certain variation, we need domain knowledge. Our approach is more effective across all the annotation results although there were quite a wide range of variations. The results in the table reflect the diversity compared to the gold-standard. However, our approach is shown to outperform the one with general term knowledge across all the cases, varying from 24% to more than 50%. We proposed a knowledge-based OA system that does not rely on heavy natural lan-guage processing to figure out the semantics or pragmatics of text, which is not really feasible for the given task at this point. Our approach is practical since the knowledge base contains lexical information, i.e. terms and their polarity information in a spe-cific domain like economy, which can be captured with relative ease. The machine-readable dictionary we developed contains not only domain specific terms, but also domain-independent opinion clue terms. We verified that our approach is effective and promising in an experiment by showing that the proposed system determines the polarity and the strength more accurately than statistically based machine learning methods and the method with only general seed words. While the experiment was done with Korean news articles, the result is valuable since most popular statistical machine learning approaches and the approach with knowledge on general, domain-independent terms only have clear limitations that should be overcome. In the future, a more detailed analysis of the reasons why machine leaning based approaches are inferior would be of great value.
