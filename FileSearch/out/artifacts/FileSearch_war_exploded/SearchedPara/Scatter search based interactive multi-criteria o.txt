 Parag C. Pendharkar n 1. Introduction due to its capability to incorporate linguistic non-crisp variable values ( Elamvazuthi et al., 2012 ). The availability of software platforms such as Matlab with fuzzy toolbox is making the use of fuzzy logic very easy in production planning ( Vasant, 2003 ;
Vasant et al., 2004 ). As a result, a variety of fuzzy linear programming (FLP) and heuristic ( Vasant and Barsoum, 2010 ) applications have emerged from variety of industries ranging from textiles ( Elamvazuthi et al., 2009 ), crude oil refinery ( Vasant et al., 2012 ) to coal mining ( Pendharkar, 1997 ). Interactive FLP has been applied to production planning in textile firms, transporta-tion planning and crude oil refinery industries ( Vasant et al., 2011 ; Pedro and Vasant, 2011 ; Vasant et al., 2010a ). Among the popular membership functions in FLP are linear and S-shaped membership functions ( Bhattacharya and Vasant, 2007 ; Vasant et al., 2010b ). Diaz-Madrronero et al. (2010) describe different membership functions used in FLP and their benefits. Generally, linear membership functions are easy to use and have higher computational efficiency. S-shaped membership functions pro-vide flexibility in describing uncertain and ill-known fuzzy problems ( Elamvazuthi et al., 2010 ).

Interactive multi-criteria problems involve simultaneous opti-mization of two or more conflicting objectives ( Bas, 2012 ; Vasant et al., 2007 ). Assuming an n -dimensional decision variable vector decisions satisfy x A X , a set of h Z 2 criteria functions f group/individual utility function u , the interactive multi-criteria optimization problem is described as follows ( Troutt, 1994 ;
Steuer, 1986 ): max f u  X  f 1  X  x  X  , ... , f h  X  x  X  X  : x A X K R n g X  1  X  and satisfies strict non-satiety 1 assumption, any solution that maximizes (1) is called the best compromise solution ( Troutt, 1994 ; Steuer, 1986 ).

Most popular methods to find a compromise solution require user interaction to identify the compromise solution. These methods use cutting planes ( Shin and Ravindran, 1991 ), Marginal Rate of
Substitution (MRS) ( Geoffrion et al., 1972 ), or abstract mass concept (AMC) ( Troutt, 1994 ) to obtain the compromise solution. While all of these methods are similar in their implementation of user interac-tion, they are different in their assumptions and the manner in which they process information. The MRS method seeks tradeoff rates between different criteria to narrow the location of compro-mise solution. The AMC method is an advanced method that seeks the cutting plane information from the user to solve a continuous piecewise polynomial system of equ ations that yields direction specific gradients for different criteria, which are then used to identify a compromise solution h alf-space. The AMC is useful when the decision maker X  X  utility function is not known or when the decision maker X  X  utility function is known but there are too many criteria to optimize which renders MRS method too difficult to use. When the decision maker X  X  utility function is known and the decision-making criteria are reas onably small then constructing cutting planes is very simple. Shin and Ravindran (1991) illustrate how these cutting planes can be constructed. Generally, the con-struction of these cutting planes requires interaction from the user on his/her satisfaction about a com puter generated solution. Typi-cally,apossiblesolutionisshowntotheuserandiftheuserisnot satisfied with the shown solution th en a cutting plane is constructed by using the value of shown solution and partial derivatives of utility function with respect to different criterion.

Once a half-space for compromise solution is identified, finding the next feasible solution in half-s pace becomes the next problem to solve in an interactive multi-criteria optimization. A popular method that is used to identify feasible solutions in the half-space is called parameter space investigation (PSI) method ( Steuer and Sun, 1995 ). The PSI method uses Monte Carlo strategy to randomly search for solutions in the solution half-space and retains solutions that belong to the solution half-space and reject s any other solutions. While the PSI works well and is independent of the number of criteria and the number of constraints, its performance is highly sensitive to the dimension of variable vector x ( Steuer and Sun, 1995 ). For example, assuming that p ( x s ) is the probability that a randomly generated s th element of vector x ,for s A {1, y , n }, from the PSI method X  X  Monte Carlo strategy belongs to the feasible solution space then the probability that all elements belonging to the feasible solution space user interaction, half-space for the compromise solution only shrinks leading to new probabilities p new  X  x s  X  r p  X  x dimension of x or for several user interactions with reasonable dimension, finding feasible solu tions using the PSI method gets increasing user interactions. Steuer and Sun (1995) ,usingamulti-criteria linear programming problem, report that for n  X  10, PSI method finds only 10 feasible solutions in 100,000 trials and for n  X  20 no feasible solution can be found in 100,000 trials. Since user interaction only decreases the feas ible region resulting in lower p new  X  x s  X  , using PSI method may be inefficient for even small problems with n  X  5 and five user interactions.

An alternative to the use of PSI method is the scatter search approach ( Glover et al., 2000 ). Scatter search is an alternative approach to random search approach where generalized path con-struction in Euclidean space is used to construct solutions. In a scatter search approach, initial sets of so lutions are random ly generated. Of these random solutions, the set of solutions that belong to the feasible region are called the reference set ( Laguna and Marti, 2003 ). The solutions from reference set are combined, using convex and non-convex combinations, to identify new reference set solutions. A typical reference set contains 5 X 20 solutions and two solutions are combined at a time to generate new reference set solutions. If the new reference set solutions are better quality solutions than the solutions in previous reference set then the previous reference set is updated to contain the best 5 X 20 solutions. Occasionally, intensifica-tion and diversification strategies are used to explore solution search space ( Glover et al., 2003 ; Laguna, 2002 ). Intensification uses minor Euclidean space perturbations to the existing reference set solutions to identify improvements. In diversification, either a random search or a line search is used in an attempt to identify solutions that are far away from the current reference set solutions.

In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria coal production planning problem with fuzzy profit and fuzzy coal quality criteria.
Next, we propose a scatter-search based interactive multi-criteria optimization procedure to identify promising solutions, and test the procedure using an example with additive and multiplicative decision-maker utilities. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , we propose the fuzzy multi-criteria model for coal production planning. In Section 3 , we describe the scatter search based interactive multi-criteria optimization procedure for solving interactive multi-criteria optimization problems. In
Section 4 , we describe a production planning example, apply scatter search procedure and provide the results of our experi-ments. In Section 5 , we provide a discussion on the proposed procedure. In Section 6 , we conclude our paper with a summary. 2. Fuzzy multi-criteria coal production planning problem
We divide this section into three sub-sections. The first sub-section contains brief overview of coal mining and coal composi-tion. The second sub-section describes fuzzy membership function design and implementation for fuzzy profit and fuzzy quality attributes. Finally, the third sub-section describes constraints to delineate feasible solution region. 2.1. Overview of coal mining and coal composition
The United States (US) has the largest coal reserves in the world, and coal has been mined in the US since the early 1800s. Recent estimates show that annual coal extraction in the US is slightly over one billion short tons 2 ( Freme, 2009 ). The primary markets for US coal are electric utility companies, independent power producers and commercial/industrial plants. The selling price for coal to these markets varies depending on the consumer. For electric utilities the selling price of coal is approximately $44.72/t, and for independent power producers the selling price is approximately $39.72/t. The selling price for commercial and industrial plants slightly higher and varies between $64.87/t and $97.28/t. The high selling price for commercial and industrial plants is, in part, due to higher transpor-tation (delivery) costs to these locations ( Freme, 2009 ).
Coal is classified into different categories depending on its elemental carbon content. There are three primary types of coal:
Anthracite, Bituminous and Lignite. Anthracite is the highest quality of coal containing between 86 and 96% elemental carbon and has the highest heat value of between 13,550 and 15,600 Btu/lb.
Bituminous and Lignite have lower percentage of elemental carbon with ranges of 46 X 86% for Bituminous coal and 46 X 60% for Lignite, respectively. All of these three forms of coal contain other elements present in organic matter, which in clude ash, sulfur and nitrogen.
Coal is sold to electric power plants through long-term con-tracts and spot sales for increased demand due to higher than anticipated economic growth or unusual weather conditions leading to higher electricity demand ( Freme, 2009 ). Most mine contracts, due to varying heat value of coal and environmental protection agency (EPA) regulations, contain coal specifications that specify limits on delivered coal heat value, sulfur, and ash content. Since coal mine locations and coal quality are governed by geology, mining companies mine different quality of coal from different mines, and blend it so that the blended coal adheres to the contractual obligations ( Pendharkar, 1997 ). If blended coal does not meet the quality standards then it can be further processed through coal washing plants to improve its quality.
Pendharkar (1997) argued that while coal companies must meet their contractual obligations, there is slight leeway on coal specifications. For example, a maximum sulfur limit of 1.2% does not necessarily mean that coal with sulfur limit of 1.205% violates contractual obligations. Thus, fuzzy measures of acceptable quality are more appropriate for determining the acceptable coal quality for given contractual obligations. In next sub-section, we describe these fuzzy measures. 2.2. Fuzzy functions for coal quality and profit coal quality in coal mining industry. In our research, we use a similar approach. Our implementation of fuzzy membership functions is slightly simple from that of Pendharkar (1997) and takes the form shown in Figs. 1 and 2 .
 variable y the actual profit, and a variable l A [0,1] denoting fuzziness of a decision maker where l  X  0 means that a manager does not allow any fuzziness and l  X  1 means that a manager allows maximum degree of fuzziness. Each profit value of y has a fuzzy level of managerial acceptance denoted by m Profit ( y ). Math-ematically, this relationship is represented as follows: sulfur in coal delivered to a market and a variable k Z 1 denoting fuzziness of a decision-maker on allowable limit of sulfur in coal, where k  X  1 means that a manager does not allow any fuzziness and desired level of sulfur in coal must be less than Q . The fuzzy level of managerial acceptance of coal with certain sulfur quality variable a , using Fig. 2 , can be denoted by m Quality ( a ), which can mathematically represented as follows:
In order to avoid variable clutter, we define two variables as 2.3. Multi-criteria coal production planning problem
Fig. 3 illustrates a typical production planning problem in mining industry. A mining company owns one or several mines. A mine may be either surface mine or an underground mine. Once extracted at a mine, coal may be cleaned/washed at a coal washing plant located in the vicinity of the mine and transported to the market (power plant). Depending on the quality of coal and production capacity of a mine, coal from different mines may have to be transported to different markets. Coal blending happens at the market location. Depending on the geographical distances between different mines and different markets, and mode of transportation  X  trucks, railroads, or river water barges  X  transportation cost varies significantly.

Assuming that a mining company that owns m Z 1 mines and serves b Z 1 markets, the multi-criteria coal production planning problem consists of a decision-maker utility function u (.) and a feasible space identified by resource and decision-maker con-straints. We assume that the decision-maker utility function is defined using fuzzy membership functions for mining company X  X  overall profit m 0 and individual market fuzzy coal quality satisfac-tion levels { m 1 , y , m b }, which is denoted as u ( m 0 separate utility function needs to be defined for each market as each market may have different coal quality requirements.
Resource constraints are, in part, due to infrastructure limiting production capacity, available equipment, geographical distances, and market demand and quality requirements. We use variables and constants defined in Table 1 to develop resource constraints.
Constants are defined using upper case characters and variables are defined using lower case characters.

In formulating our model, we assume that each mine has maximum production capacity specified by its upper bound and a minimum production capacity below which cost of mining exceeds coal production revenues. Each ma rket has a constant demand over a contractual period and quality req uirements that need to be satisfied.
Additionally, we assume that tradeoffs between profit and coal quality are measured as fuzzy membership functions described in previous sub-section.

Using the variables from Table 1 , we specify following resource constraints. 1. The production from a mine i A {1, y , m } must be greater than or equal to its lower bound LB i .
 2. The production from a mine i A {1, y , m } must be less than or equal to its upper bound UB i .
 3. The demand for all the markets must be satisfied by the amount of coal transported to them from different mines. 4. Non-negativity of variables. p ij Z 0 8 i A f 1 , ... , m g and 8 i A f 1 , ... , b g X  7  X 
The profit and coal quality criteria variables y and a j are defined as follows. y  X  and a j  X  The fuzzy membership functions m 0 , m 1 , y , m b are defined using Figs. 1 and 2 . Specifically,  X  m Profit  X  y  X  and m j  X  m Quality  X  a j  X 8 j A f 1 , ... , b g
Thus, the objective of the multi-criteria fuzzy coal production planning problem is to solve for unknown variables p ij so that y Z and a j Q j while satisfying constraints (4) X (7). Using membership functions for profit and quality, we can state this multi-criteria fuzzy coal production planning as follows. max u  X  m 0 , m 1 , ... , m b  X  X  9  X 
Subject to: Eqs. (4) X (7) and tradeoff cutting plane constraints defined by interaction with the decision-maker.

The decision-maker utility function could be additive, i.e., u  X  m , m 1 , ... , m b  X  X  m 0  X  P b i  X  1 m i , multiplicative u  X  m satisfying strict non-satiety property. 3. Scatter search for interactive multi-criteria optimization problem
In an interactive multi-criteria optimization, a solution procedure starts with several random solutions in the feasible space (reference set solutions), selects a random reference set solution and shows it to the user. The user either accepts the shown solution or rejects it.
If the solution is rejected then a tradeoff cutting plane is created using the parameters of the rejected solution ( Shin and Ravindran, 1991 ). This tradeoff cutting plane is added in the set of resource constraints, which reduces the f easible search space (sometimes called half-space). In our research, we use the scatter search to identify new solutions in the reduced feasible space after a tradeoff cutting plane is added. When the reference set is updated using the scatter search procedure, a new random reference set solution from the reduced feasible search space is shown to the user again, who either accepts the new solution or rejects it. This interactive procedure of showing a reference set solution to the user and adding a tradeoff cutting plane  X  if solution is rejected by the user  X  continues until the user is satisfied or a fixed number of interactions elapse or procedure cannot find new reference set solutions in the reduced feasible space after a tr adeoff cutting plane is added.
The solution vector for the multi-criteria coal production planning problem is a multidimensional matrix with its elements as p . However, the solution shown to the decision-maker is the say l t , shown to him/her at iteration t Z 1 then a tradeoff ratio T is computed as follows ( Shin and Ravindran, 1991 ):
T  X  @ u @ m ! A new tradeoff cut constraint is added using following inequality:
T
Once a tradeoff cut is added, for t Z 1, scatter search is used to identify new solutions in reduced the feasible solution search space.
 We illustrate the working of scatter search with an example.
Let X  X  say we begin with a reference set of five solutions and a random solution is shown to a decision-maker. Assuming that the decision-maker is not satisfied, a tradeoff cut constraint is added, which reduces the feasible solution search space and only two of the original five solutions from initial reference set lie inside the new feasible solution search space. To maintain the cardinality of reference set to five, three new solutions have to be generated in the new feasible solution space. There are three different ways to generate these three solutions  X  use random search, use convex combination of two feasible solutions or use non-convex linear search. Scatter search primarily uses the latter two approaches with random search used occasionally to increase the diversity of reference set solutions.

When all constraints are linear, the feasible solution space is convex and any convex combination of solutions inside the feasible region will lead to new solutions being created inside the feasible region. Assuming p 1 ij and p 2 ij represent two solutions inside new feasible solution space then the elements of three new solutions can be generated using following expression for convex combination: p new ij  X  l p 1 ij  X  X  1 l  X  p 2 ij , 8 i A f 1 , ... , m g and 8 j where l is any random number between 0 and 1.
 dimensional Cartesian coordinates, we assume two points ( X ) and ( X 2 , Y 2 ) as shown in Fig. 4 . We use upper case characters to avoid any conflict with lower case variables used in our produc-tion planning model described in previous section. Using coordi-nate geometry, it is easy to find the equation of a line through the two points, which is as follows:
Y Y 1  X  Y 1 Y 2 X
The non-convex line search requires randomly generating an element on either X -axis or Y -axis so that it will lead to extension of the line joining the two known points ( X 1 , Y 1 ) and ( X illustration, selecting any random element X n , for n  X  3, that lies in the feasible region and satisfies X n 4 max ( X 1 , X 2 ) and X ( X , X 2 ) will lead to extension of line between two points ( X and ( X 2 , Y 2 ). Once we find such an element, we have to find the corresponding element Y n so that the point ( X n , Y n ) fall on the line joining ( X 1 , Y 1 ) and ( X 2 , Y 2 ) and extend it to ( X this Y n can be obtained from following equation:
Y  X  Y 1  X 
If we were working in three dimensional space with points ( X
Y ,Z 1 ) and ( X 2 , Y 2 ,Z 2 ) then the combination procedure remains same, but we work in two-dimensions at a time. So we will get the values of X n and Y n as mentioned before and then we will compute the value of Z n as follows:
Z  X  Z 1  X 
In context of our research problem, this concept can be implemented in pseudo-code shown in Fig. 5 .

Convex combination serves the purpose of intensification because this combination seeks t o find solutions in between the two elements from the feasible solutions. Non-convex line search serves the purpose of diversifica tion because it seeks to find new solutions that appear on the extended line connecting two feasible solutions. Using the foregoing observations, we summarize the scatter search procedure for interactive multi-criteria optimization in Fig. 6 .

In Step 2, we show a random reference set solution to the decision-maker for following four reasons. First, selecting a random solution, which may not be optimal, allows convex combination or line search procedure to be applied with certain probability in step 4. Second, in instances where there are multiple reference set solutions with same decision-maker utility, a random solution has to be selected to break a tie. Third, since we are dealing with fuzzy membership functions in utilities, optimal/ best solution in reference set of solutions is also a fuzzy concept in that a decision-maker may not necessarily discern solutions that only differ in small utility of their membership functions. Finally, the best solution is shown in Step 7 at the termination of interactive procedure and cannot be missed by the procedure. For a bi-criteria or multi-criteria problems, weights decision-makers assign to different criteria are not known, so determining best solution in reference set of solutions is not an easy task. The primary reason to use interactive procedure is to allow decision-maker to see a solution and accept or reject it. After multiple rejections by a decision-maker, all reference set solutions start converging to similar values (see Table 4e ) guaranteeing conver-gence to the best solution (see Section 5 ). We implemented the proposed scatter search procedure in the C  X  X  programming language and tested it. We then applied the procedure on a bi-criteria coal production planning problem described in next section. For our random search, we used uniform distribution to generate random numbers. 4. An illustrative example of bi-criteria coal production planning We use a production planning problem described in Pendharkar (1997) to illustrate the application of the proposed scatter search based multi-criteria procedure. Pendharkar (1997) used a single criteria fuzzy profit optimization problem consisting of two mines and one market. For a mining company, we use data from Pendharkar (1997) which is shown in Table 2 . The market data for our study, taken in part from Pendharkar (1997) study, is shown in Table 3 .

Unlike Pendharkar (1997) study where a fuzzy linear program-ming problem was solved for optimizing fuzzy profit for a mining company, in our study we are using interactive procedure for optimizing decision-maker X  X  utility function defined on two fuzzy criteria of profit and coal quality defined by amount of sulfur limit in coal. For our solution, we assume the decision-maker defined values of l  X  1.0, k  X  1.1, Q  X  1.1 (from Table 3 ), and Z  X  7500,000 in Figs. 1 and 2 , respectively. The decision maker utility function for two criteria is u ( m 0 , m 1 ). This utility function may be additive or multiplicative. The additive utility function will be appropriate if fuzzy criteria m 0 and m 1 are independent of each other ( Delquie and Luo, 1997 ), and multiplicative utility function is appropriate when fuzzy criteria m 0 and m 1 interact with each other ( Keeney, 1974 ). While multiplicative decision-maker utility is more appro-priate for our production planning problem, we use both additive and multiplicative utilities to demonstrate the functionality of scatter search procedure. Fig. 7 illustrates the flowchart for interactive procedure used in our illustrative example. All experi-ments were conducted using Visual Studio.Net 2010 running under Windows 7 with Intel Core i5 3.1 GHz processor and 8 GB RAM. 4.1. A case of additive decision maker utility function
We assume a simple additive decision maker utility function of the form u ( m 0 , m 1 )  X  m 0  X  m 1 . This function leads to following tradeoff cut when a solution l t is rejected by a decision-maker at the interaction iteration t :  X  m 1 Z  X  m t 0  X  m t 1  X  X  16  X 
We set the value of N  X  5 and run the interactive scatter search procedure. Table 4a illustrates the reference set solutions from first step. For convenience, we report values of p ij , m
However, a typical procedure will show only m 0 , and m 1 decision-maker must either accept or reject. The random solution shown to the decision-maker, from the reference set of five solutions, is highlighted in bold font in Table 4a .

Assuming that the decision-maker rejects the solution shown to him/her, a tradeoff cut is added in the set of constraints, and scatter search procedure finds a new reference set of solutions as shown in Table 4b . As before, the random solution  X  from reference set of solutions  X  shown to the decision-maker appears in bold font in the table.

Assuming that the decision-maker rejects all the solutions shown to him/her so that the procedure only terminates when
N  X  5, the next three interactive iterations are shown in Tables 4c X 4e .

The final random solution shown to the user is not the best solution. If user rejects this solution then the scatter search fails to come up with new reference set in the reduced feasible region, which also leads to the termination of procedure. At termination, best solution vector with a profit $5636,400 is shown to the user.
The values of p 11  X  698,200 t, and p 21  X  374,500 are used as the final solution values. The overall decision-maker utility is approximately 1.75. Fig. 8 illustrates tradeoff cuts added at the end of each interaction and the final solution point. The utilities of solution ( QUOTE ) shown to the decision-maker for each iteration is plotted in Fig. 9 . Both Figs. 8 and 9 indicate rapid convergence in tradeoff cuts and overall decision-maker utility within five iterations. 4.2. The case of multiplicative utility function
As with the case of additive utility function, we assume a simple multiplicative decision maker utility function of the form u ( m , m 1 )  X  m 0 m 1 . This function leads to following tradeoff cut when a solution l t is rejected by a decision-maker at the interaction iteration t : m t  X  m t 0 m 1 Z 2  X  m t 0 m t 1  X  X  17  X 
The first iteration of scatter search procedure provides refer-ence set solutions shown in Table 5a , which is exactly same as
Table 4a because no tradeoff cuts are added and initial feasible is same for both additive and multiplicative utility functions. Bold font rows in tables indicate a random solution shown to the decision-maker for each interaction.

The second iteration reference set solutions, after adding a tradeoff cut based on the solution shown to the decision-maker in first iteration is shown in Table 5b .
 her at second iteration, scatter search procedure generates the third reference set of solutions as shown in Table 5c . Rejection of shown solution from the third reference set leads to a new reference set solutions shown in Table 5d .
 shown to him/her, the procedure terminates due to a failure to find better solutions in the new feasible space and returns the best known solution vector. The final solution vector is same as the fourth set solution vector shown to the decision-maker.
A reader may note that the final solutions for additive and multiplicative utilities are exactly same except that in case of multiplicative utility the final solution was obtained in four iterations. The result is not entirely surprising because it appears that there are many solutions that can achieve a value of m
Focusing on all of the solutions where m 1  X  1, maximization of additive utility and multiplicative utility both become a problem of maximizing m 0 with m 1  X  1. As a result, we get the same final solution for both utility function. Fig. 10 illustrates a plot of total decision-maker utility for the solution shown to the decision-maker at each iteration.

For our coal production planning problem, the results from additive and multiplicative utility are convergent to one solution where the mining company can expect overall profit of
Display a random No approximately $5.6 million with a market that would be highly satisfied in terms of quality of coal delivered to it. 5. Discussion
In this section, we discuss some of the algorithmic concepts of scatter search procedure for multi-criteria interactive search based fuzzy decision-making problems. The proposed scatter search procedure, due to following Lemma 1 , is very robust with guaranteed exponential convergence.

Lemma 1. The feasible area for reference set solutions after t 4 0 tradeoff cuts for bi-criteria problem has an upper bound l l
A (0,1).

Proof. The initial feasible area for reference set solutions for bi-criteria problems is a convex set square with an area of 1 (see Fig. 8 ).
Since each tradeoff cut bisects original feasible solutions square with area one into smaller triangles. When t 4 0 and a tradeoff cut reduces the area of the square, the upper bound on feasible solutions set area is l , where l  X  1 e and e is infinitesimally non-Archimedean 3 area of smallest triangle cannot be zero , l must also be greater than zero. &amp;
The bound provided by Lemma 1 is very loose and in reality the value of l for many problems may be close to 0.5 as opposed to 1 e . As an example, for additive utility function described in
Section 4.1 , adding first tradeoff cut reduces feasible solution set area from one to just 0.1596. The next three tradeoff cuts further reduce feasible solution set areas to 0.0655, 0.0389 and 0.0373, respectively. Having solved the additive utility problem by
Every tradeoff cut reduces feasible solution area and forces identification of new solutions towards north-east direction.  X  0.5 1.5 Total Utility interactive procedure, a tight problem specific value for l can be estimated retroactively using feasible set areas and Lemma 1 .
Using Lemma 1 and known feasible areas from each of four cuts, we can write a set of equations for each interaction: l  X  0.1596, l 2  X  0.0655, l 3  X  0.0389, and l 4  X  0.0373. All four interactions can be added and combined into a polynomial: l  X  l 2  X  l 3  X  l (0.1596  X  0.0655  X  0.0389  X  0.0373)  X  0, where l A (0,1). When solved, the polynomial provides four roots, two of them contain imaginary terms and one root contains negative value. The only root that satisfies the constraint l A (0,1) has a value of l  X  0.2322.
With such a low problem specific value of l , it is not surprising that our solution converged so quickly in just four interactions (see Fig. 9 ).
 combination procedure expedites convergence by bringing solu-tions in reference set closer to each other. Non-convex line search may be beneficial initially when feasible solution set area is larger and convex combination may be beneficial as feasible solution set area becomes smaller. For multi-criteria problems containing more than two criteria over initial convex feasible set of solutions, the upper bound on feasible solutions set area from Lemma 1 can be changed to M l t , where M is the initial feasible solution set area.
Since l t -0 for large values of t when l A (0,1) and positive, as long as fuzzy multi-criteria decision making problems are built using fuzzy membership functions, proposed scatter search solution procedure is guaranteed to converge very fast for even most complex real-world fuzzy multi-criteria problems. 6. Summary and conclusions interactive multi-criteria optimization problems. We also pro-posed a fuzzy bi-criteria production planning problem in the coal mining industry. Using a coal production planning problem, we illustrated an application of scatter search procedure for additive and multiplicative decision-maker utilities. The results of our experiments indicate that the scatter search procedure works very well for interactive multi-criteria optimization problems. procedure converge very fast, and five solutions with a maximum of five interactions worked very well. We believe that a natural extension to our study is to extend the scatter search procedure for solving multi-criteria combinatorial optimization problems.
The extension would require the proposed scatter search proce-dure to be combined with other heuristic search procedures such as tabu search, simulated annealing or genetic algorithms. When combined with a heuristic procedure, scatter search may be used to obtain values for variables that take real-number values, and a heuristic search procedure (tabu search, simulated annealing or genetic algorithm) may be used to obtain values for variables that take discrete/integer values.
