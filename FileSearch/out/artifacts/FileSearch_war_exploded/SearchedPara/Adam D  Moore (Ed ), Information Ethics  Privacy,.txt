 Adam D. Moore (Ed.), Information Ethics: Privacy, Property, and Power, University of Washington Press, 2005, 455 pp., ISBN: 0-295-98489-9, Paper, $30.00
This edited anthology on Information Ethics: Privacy, Property, and Power is clearly a timely volume, and in a thoughtful way it presents major historical works and contemporary research on what is becoming a very large, fast growing, and interdisciplinary topic. As noted in the introduction, information ethics includes the distinct yet interrelated disciplines of  X  X  X pplied ethics, intellectual property, privacy, free speech, and soci-etal control of information X  X  (11). The essays gathered include basic readings in moral theory, as well as articles on increasingly urgent normative issues surrounding information control, such as intellectual property inter-ests in patents and copyright, privacy concerns surrounding genetic data, employee monitoring and Caller ID, the clash between freedom of expression and privacy with digital speech and images, and new threats to pri-vacy through governmental programs such as e-mail surveillance under Carnivore, and enhanced searches and data gathering allowed by the USA Patriot Act. Thus the book is aimed at a broad audience and should be of interest to those in such diverse fields as information science, philosophy, law, public policy, communications and media studies.

This book of essays will be useful for independent research or as a text in courses in disciplines related to information ethics. The introduction gives historical background on moral theory and applied ethics, intellec-tual property, privacy, and free speech and societal control over information, as well as summaries of the 20 articles in the book, 14 of which are reprinted in whole or part from other books or journals or law reviews. There are then five sections of articles addressing (1) moral reasoning and moral theory, (2) moral and legal concerns surrounding intellectual property, (3) theory and cases on privacy and information control, (4) con-flicts associated with free speech and information control, and (5) governmental and social programs allowing access to more information and data while reducing individual privacy and control over information. At the end of each of these five sections are several short discussion cases, either descriptions of hypothetical dilem-mas or summaries of actual court cases. Many will find these cases one of the most valuable parts of the anthology for course use and discussions.

The overall goal of Information Ethics: Privacy, Property, and Power is to provide both historical and the-oretical background on the issues surrounding information ethics, to inspire readers to ponder and debate the importance accorded to intellectual property rights, free speech, privacy and control over information. In addition, the aim is to guide readers to understand the various ways in which these may conflict, and the nor-mative and policy considerations relevant in trying to answer difficult questions they raise for contemporary problems in an age of information technology.

Part I,  X  X  X n Ethical Framework for Analysis, X  X  begins with Tom Regan  X  s reasoned analysis of some pit-falls associated with trying to answer moral questions, identifying weak arguments, such as appeals to authority, and his discussion of the role of reasoning over the use of feelings in ethical decision-making to identify features of  X  X  X deal X  X  arguments containing conceptual clarity, rationality, etc. This selection is fol-lowed by major and well-known classics in ethical theory from John Stuart Mill and Immanuel Kant. Mill defends utilitarianism, with right action determined by the maximization of pleasure over pain, whereas Kant supports a rationalist theory based on his categorical imperative to act in such a way that one can at the same time will the maxim (or rule of conduct) of one  X  s action to be a universal law. Last is Vir-ginia Held  X  s essay on feminist transformations of moral theory, which demonstrates how fundamental as-pects in the history of ethics have not been gender-neutral. Held also discusses several ways in which feminist thinking is transforming moral concepts and theories with an emphasis on including emotion, understanding and trust in ethical decision making, criticizing and revising the conceptions of public and private, and introducing alternative concepts of the self. This part on moral theory will be familiar to those with background in ethics, but especially useful for those without philosophical training. The four selections cannot provide a complete overview of moral reasoning and moral theory, as there is no inclu-sion of rights theory or intuitionism, for example. But it is a well-rounded section that certainly provides an introduction to the two main historical theories, an applied essay on moral decision making, with a con-trasting perspective and contemporary explanation of ways in which moral theories need to be rethought and revised.
Major themes actively being debated are well represented by the fascinating topics in the next four sections of the book. Part II,  X  X  X ntellectual Property: Moral and Legal Concerns, X  X  begins with a strong selection by
Frank Easterbrook arguing from the judicial perspective that intellectual property deserves the same recogni-tion and rights as physical property. The essay by Tom Palmer examines the ethics of patent monopolies and copyrights, but the article also includes arguments for and against intellectual property rights. The following papers focus on the difficulties of applying traditional physical property considerations to intellectual property debates, as well as issues surrounding biopiracy, and the ownership of human genes and genetic resources. The last essay by Adam Moore focuses on intangible property such as personal information and ideas, and makes a case that there are limits on what can be done with such property based on a harm principle and privacy rights. The topic of intellectual property is becoming so broad that other topics might have been addressed as well. There are intriguing questions about ownership and power, for example, such as whether a faculty member posting lectures on the Internet owns the material or whether his/her academic institution owns them, or someone else, and thus to whom royalties are owed. Nevertheless, there is much to be learned from the interesting articles included here.

Part III on  X  X  X rivacy and Information Control X  X  begins with the famous 1890 Warren and Brandeis article from the Harvard Law Review defending creation of a new privacy tort to protect individuals from invasions caused by technologies such as newspapers, photography and films. While courts did not immediately recog-nize privacy as they advocated, by the early 1900s such legal protection over information about oneself had become standard. The other essays in this portion of the book are an eclectic selection of independent papers on privacy and issues of control over DNA and genetic data, privacy concerns raised by employee monitoring through surveillance equipment, and the privacy advantages and disadvantages of telephone systems known as Caller ID. While the three articles focus on quite different topics, all address the way technological advances allow more and more information to be gathered, stored and disseminated, and the crucial ques-tions of deciding the extent to which this is justifiable, how the information should be handled, and how pri-vacy is enhanced by technology or more often compromised when individuals lose control over information about themselves.

Kent Greenawalt  X  s essay beginning Part IV on  X  X  X reedom of Speech and Information Control X  X  is a won-derful inclusion, considering from a legal perspective the classic arguments in favor of free speech in relation to privacy and censorship. The article on  X  X  X igital Speech and Democratic Culture X  X   X  X  X ddresses the tensions between free speech and intellectual property against the backdrop of ever-expanding digital technologies (25), describing how telecommunications policy and intellectual property law will need to be reviewed and reinterpreted to protect freedom of expression in the changing context of a digital revolution. The final paper on  X  X  X rivacy, Photography and the Press X  X  revisits and elaborates on concerns from the Warren and Brandeis essay but ultimately argues that societal interests in freedom of the press and photographic expression out-weigh any expansion of current privacy protection in the law. Although there is much more to be said about the conflicts between freedom of expression and privacy as control over information, these papers provide a fine starting point.

The final section, Part V on  X  X  X overnmental and Societal Control of Information, X  X  may well be of greatest interest to readers in this post 9/11 age. It begins with an article on Carnivore, an Internet monitoring system that can be used to monitor the e-mail of virtually anyone around the world. The author defends the benefits of
Carnivore for law enforcement, and attempts to dispel privacy concerns of the system. Privacy advocates will likely disagree, believing restrictions on the use of Carnivore are in order. Anita Allen  X  s essay  X  X  X rivacy Isn  X  t
Everything: Accountability as a Personal and Social Good X  X  points out the many ways what we may view as private parts of our lives demand accountability and ultimately societal control. While not abandoning her pre-vious defenses of privacy, she points out the realistic ways in which substantial accountability for our personal lives is necessary, thus eroding the extent to which we can protect private facts. The section concludes with an article on the civil liberty concerns raised by the USA Patriot Act. After a survey of historical cases on chal-lenges to legal rights in the name of national security, he details the ways in which national security and terrorist threats have been used to limit civil rights and privacy for all through enhanced governmental surveillance and data gathering, concluding with recommendations for a better balance between individual rights and national security in an age of terrorism. These contemporary readings are certain to inspire vigorous debates.
Information ethics is an emerging field, raising novel and complex problems as new technologies make more information from databases, e-mail correspondence, searches, and surveillance widely available, eroding privacy and an individual  X  s ability to control information about oneself and others  X  access to it. Different readers will find certain articles and sections more or less relevant to their work, and might have made dif-ferent choices about selections to include. Nevertheless, this anthology provides an excellent range of provoc-ative articles on multiple and varied topics. It reviews important background on ethics, privacy and free speech. The book also highlights the many unresolved moral and legal problems concerning intellectual prop-erty and ownership, genetic data and surveillance and information control, conflicts between free speech and privacy, and the erosion of privacy and civil liberties through e-mail monitoring and searches and surveillance justified for government agencies through Carnivore and the USA Patriot Act provisions. The importance of these current topics, and the diverse points of view represented, should help the book get the wide attention it deserves.
 Richard Rogers, Information Politics on the Web, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2004, 216 pp., ISBN: 0-262-18242-4
Information Politics on the Web , by Richard Rogers, is both an  X  X  X xpose of the politics of information de-vices X  X  and a call for new practices of source inclusion and information adjudication that will help increase the inclusivity, fairness and scope of representation in electronically mediated politics. Rogers argues that a com-bination of exclusivity and closed logics in key information portals, such as Google, privilege entrenched polit-ical actors and official sources, reinforcing traditional hierarchies at the expense of alternative accounts of political reality. For example, a search for  X  X  X errorism X  X  in Google yields  X  X  X he White House, the CIA, the FBI, the Heritage Foundation, a smattering of strategic studies groups at Universities, CNN, and Al Jazeera X  X  within the top twenty listings. These results provide an indication that the Web is becoming increasingly dom-inated by what Manual Castells refers to as  X  X  X nformational politics, X  X  where governments and political parties act not through traditional government X  X itizen exchanges but through mediated forums such as newspapers, broadcasting media and the Internet. 1 Although cyberspace may be seen as opening opportunities for political representation, this outcome is by no means guaranteed.

To counter these anti-democratic trends, Rogers introduces instruments designed specifically to flatten the hierarchies of political voice and move the processes of information adjudication back into the public sphere X  from the back-end politics of paid search engine placement, for example, to the front end politics of transpar-ent (but not necessarily inclusive) information tools.

By creating instruments that can illuminate the Web  X  s  X  X  X mbedded information X  X  (that information gener-ated online and not simply repurposed from offline sources) and the  X  X  X djudicative cultural processes X  X  that drive its evolution, Rogers hopes to open a new space for informational politics, a space where formally dis-enfranchised actors may have a voice  X  X  X ide by side X  X  with more mainstream political actors. The book will likely be of interest to a wide range of readers: social scientists looking for new approaches to Internet re-search, activists frustrated with the obstacles of traditional information politics, politicians and policy makers
