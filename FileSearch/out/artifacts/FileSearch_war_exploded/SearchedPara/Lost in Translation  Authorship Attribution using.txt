 Authorship attribution is the following problem: For a given text, determine the author of said text among a list of candidate authors . Determining author-ship is difficult, and a host of methods have been proposed: As of 1998 Rudman estimated the num-ber of metrics used in such methods to be at least 1000 (Rudman, 1997). For comprehensive recent surveys see e.g. (Juola, 2006; Koppel et al., 2008; Stamatatos, 2009). The process of authorship at-tribution consists of selecting markers (features that provide an indication of the author), and classifying a text by assigning it to an author using some appro-priate machine learning technique. 1.1 Attribution of translated texts In contrast to the general authorship attribution problem, the specific problem of attributing trans-lated texts to their original author has received little attention. Conceivably, this is due to the common intuition that the impact of the translator may add enough noise that proper attribution to the original author will be very difficult; for example, in (Arun et al., 2009) it was found that the imprint of the translator was significantly greater than that of the original author. The volume of resources for nat-ural language processing in English appears to be much larger than for any other language, and it is thus, conceivably, convenient to use the resources at hand for a translated version of the text, rather than the original.

To appreciate the difficulty of purely lexical or syntactic characterization of authors based on trans-lation, consider the following excerpts from three different translations of the first few paragraphs of Turgenev X  X  DvornskoeGnezdo :
As translators express the same semantic content in different ways the syntax and style of different translations of the same text will differ greatly due to the footprint of the translators; this footprint may affect the classification process in different ways de-pending on the features.

For markers based on language structure such as grammar or function words it is to be expected that the footprint of the translator has such a high im-pact on the resulting text that attribution to the au-thor may not be possible. However, it is possi-ble that a specific author/translator combination has its own unique footprint discernible from other au-thor/translator combinations: A specific translator may often translate often used phrases in the same way. Ideally, the footprint of the author is (more or less) unaffected by the process of translation, for ex-ample if the languages are very similar or the marker is not based solely on lexical or syntactic features.
In contrast to purely lexical or syntactic features, the semantic content is expected to be, roughly, the same in translations and originals. This leads us to hypothesize that a marker based on semantic frames such as found in the FrameNet database (Ruppen-hofer et al., 2006), will be largely unaffected by translations, whereas traditional lexical markers will be severely impacted by the footprint of the transla-tor.

The FrameNet project is a database of annotated exemplar frames, their relations to other frames and obligatory as well as optional frame elements for each frame. FrameNet currently numbers approxi-mately 1000 different frames annotated with natural language examples. In this paper, we combine the data from FrameNet with the LTH semantic parser (Johansson and Nugues, 2007), until very recently (Das et al., 2010) the semantic parser with best ex-perimental performance (note that the performance of LTH on our corpora is unknown and may dif-fer from the numbers reported in (Johansson and Nugues, 2007)). 1.2 Related work The research on authorship attribution is too volu-minous to include; see the excellent surveys (Juola, 2006; Koppel et al., 2008; Stamatatos, 2009) for an overview of the plethora of lexical and syntac-tic markers used. The literature on the use of se-mantic markers is much scarcer: Gamon (Gamon, 2004) developed a tool for producing semantic de-pendency graphs and using the resulting information in conjunction with lexical and syntactic markers to improve the accuracy of classification. McCarthy et al. (McCarthy et al., 2006) employed WordNet and latent semantic analysis to lexical features with the purpose of finding semantic similarities between words; it is not clear whether the use of semantic features improved the classification. Argamon et al. (Argamon, 2007) used systemic functional gram-mars to define a feature set associating single words or phrases with semantic information (an approach reminiscent of frames); Experiments of authorship identification on a corpus of English novels of the 19th century showed that the features could improve the classification results when combined with tra-ditional function word features. Apart from a few studies (Arun et al., 2009; Holmes, 1992; Archer et al., 1997), the problem of attributing translated texts appears to be fairly untouched. As pointed out in (Luyckx and Daelemans, 2010) the size of data set and number of authors may crucially affect the efficiency of author attribution methods, and evaluation of the method on some standard cor-pus is essential (Stamatatos, 2009).

Closest to a standard corpus for author attribu-tion is The Federalist Papers (Juola, 2006), origi-nally used by Mosteller and Wallace (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964), and we employ the subset of this corpus consisting of the 71 undisputed single-author documents as our Corpus I .

For translated texts, a mix of authors and transla-tors across authors is needed to ensure that the at-tribution methods do not attribute to the translator instead of the author. However, there does not ap-pear to be a large corpus of texts publicly available that satisfy this demand.

Based on this, we elected to compile a fresh cor-pus of translated texts; our Corpus II consists of En-glish translations of 19th century Russian romantic literature chosen from Project Gutenberg for which a number of different versions, with different trans-lators existed. The corpus primarily consists of nov-els, but is slightly polluted by a few collections of short stories and two nonfiction works by Tolstoy due to the necessity of including a reasonable mix of authors and translators. The corpus consists of 30 texts by 4 different authors and 12 different transla-tors of which some have translated several different authors. The texts range in size from 200 (Turgenev: The Rendezvous) to 33000 (Tolstoy: War and Peace) sentences.

The option of splitting the corpus into an artifi-cially larger corpus by sampling sentences for each author and collating these into a large number of new documents was discarded; we deemed that the sam-pling could inadvertently both smooth differences between the original texts and smooth differences in the translators X  footprints. This could have resulted in an inaccurate positive bias in the evaluation re-sults. For both corpora, authorship attribution experiments were performed using six classifiers, each employ-ing a distinct feature set. For each feature set the markers were counted in the text and their relative frequencies calculated. Feature selection was based solely on training data in the inner loop of the cross-validation cycle. Two sets of experiments were per-formed, each with with X = 200 and X = 400 features; the size of the feature vector was kept con-stant across comparison of methods, due to space constraints only results for 400 features are reported. The feature sets were: Frequent Words (FW): Frequencies in the text of Character N-grams: The X most frequent N-Frames: The relative frequencies of the X most Frequent Words and Frames (FWaF): The X/ 2
In order to gauge the impact of translation upon an author X  X  footprint, three different experiments were performed on subsets of Corpus II:
The full corpus of 30 texts [ Corpus IIa ] was used for authorship attribution with an ample mix of au-thors an translators, several translators having trans-lated texts by more than one author. To ascertain how heavily each marker is influenced by translation we also performed translator attribution on a sub-set of 11 texts [ Corpus IIb ] with 3 different transla-tors each having translated 3 different authors. If the translator leaves a heavy footprint on the marker, the marker is expected to score better when attributing to translator than to author. Finally, we reduced the corpus to a set of 18 texts [ Corpus IIc ] that only in-cludes unique author/translator combinations to see if each marker could attribute correctly to an author if the translator/author combination was not present in the training set.

All classification experiments were conducted using a multi-class winner-takes-all (Duan and Keerthi, 2005) support vector machine (SVM). For cross-validation, all experiments used leave-one-out (i.e. N -fold for N texts in the corpus) validation. All features were scaled to lie in the range [0 , 1] be-fore different types of features were combined. In each step of the cross-validation process, the most frequently occurring features were selected from the training data, and to minimize the effect of skewed training data on the results, oversampling with sub-stitution was used on the training data. We tested our results for statistical significance us-ing McNemar X  X  test (McNemar, 1947) with Yates X  correction for continuity (Yates, 1934) against the null hypothesis that the classifier is indistinguishable from a random attribution weighted by the number of author texts in the corpus.
 Table 1: Accuracy of a random weighted attribution.
FWaF performed better than FW for attribution of author on translated texts. However, the difference failed to be statistically significant.

Results of the experiments are reported in the ta-ble below. For each corpus results are given for experiments with 400 features. We report macro 2 precision/recall, and the corresponding F1 and ac-curacy scores; the best scoring result in each row is shown in boldface . For each corpus the bottom row indicates whether each classifier is significantly dis-cernible from a weighted random attribution. 4.1 Corpus I: The Federalist Papers For the Federalist Papers the traditional authorship attribution markers all lie in the 95+ range in accu-racy as expected. However, the frame-based mark-ers achieved statistically significant results, and can hence be used for authorship attribution on untrans-lated documents (but performs worse than the base-line). FWaF did not result in an improvement over FW. 4.2 Corpus II: Attribution of translated texts For Corpus IIa X  X he entire corpus of translated texts X  all methods achieve results significantly better than random, and FWaF is the best-scoring method, fol-lowed by FW.

The results for Corpus IIb (three authors, three translators) clearly suggest that the footprint of the translator is evident in the translated texts, and that the FW (function word) classifier is particularly sen-sitive to the footprint. In fact, FW was the only one achieving a significant result over random assign-ment, giving an indication that this marker may be particularly vulnerable to translator influence when attempting to attribute authors.

For Corpus IIc (unique author/translator combina-tions) decreased performance of all methods is evi-dent. Some of this can be attributed to a smaller (training) corpus, but we also suspect the lack of several instances of the same author/translator com-binations in the corpus.

Observe that the FWaF classifier is the only classifier with significantly better performance than weighted random assignment, and outperforms the other methods. Frames alone also outperform tradi-tional markers, albeit not by much.

The experiments on the collected corpora strongly suggest the feasibility of using Frames as markers for authorship attribution, in particular in combina-tion with traditional lexical approaches.

Our inability to obtain demonstrably significant improvement of FWaF over the approach based on Frequent Words is likely an artifact of the fairly small corpus we employ. However , computation of significance is generally woefully absent from stud-ies of automated author attribution, so it is conceiv-able that the apparent improvement shown in many such studies fail to be statistically significant under closer scrutiny (note that the exact tests to employ for statistical significance in information retrieval X  including text categorization X  X s a subject of con-tention (Smucker et al., 2007)). We have investigated the use of semantic frames as markers for author attribution and tested their appli-cability to attribution of translated texts. Our results show that frames are potentially useful, especially so for translated texts, and suggest that a combined method of frequent words and frames can outper-form methods based solely on traditional markers, on translated texts. For attribution of untranslated texts and attribution to translator traditional markers such as frequent words and n-grams are still to be preferred.

Our test corpora consist of a limited number of authors, from a limited time period, with translators from a similar limited time period and cultural con-text. Furthermore, our translations are all from a sin-gle language. Thus, further work is needed before firm conclusions regarding the general applicability of the methods can be made.

It is well known that effectiveness of authorship markers may be influenced by topics (Stein et al., 2007; Schein et al., 2010); while we have endeav-ored to design our corpora to minimize such influ-ence, we do not currently know the quantitative im-pact on topicality on the attribution methods in this paper. Furthermore, traditional investigations of au-thorship attribution have focused on the case of at-tributing texts among a small ( N &lt; 10 ) class of authors at the time, albeit with recent, notable ex-ceptions (Luyckx and Daelemans, 2010; Koppel et al., 2010). We test our methods on similarly re-stricted sets of authors; the scalability of the meth-ods to larger numbers of authors is currently un-known. Combining several classification methods into an ensemble method may yield improvements in precision (Raghavan et al., 2010); it would be interesting to see whether a classifier using frames yields significant improvements in ensemble with other methods. Finally, the distribution of frames in texts is distinctly different from the distribution of words: While there are function words , there are no  X  X unction frames X , and certain frames that are com-mon in a corpus may fail to occur in the training material of a given author; it is thus conceivable that smoothing would improve classification by frames more than by words or N-grams.
