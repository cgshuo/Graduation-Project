 Many real world applications generate continuously arriving data, such as busi-ness transactions, web logs, sensors networks, etc. This type of data is known as data streams [1]. Generally speaking, a data stream can be considered as a sequence of items of structural information in which each item is stamped with a time point. As the arrival items change with time, the data distribution of the underlying structural information may change as well. Usually, the cause of the change is unknown. To understand the behaviors of data streams, it is important to investigate the changes of the distributions and the causes of the changes.
Semantically, the distribution of the structural information at a particular time point in a data stream is referred to as representation of a concept. A schema of structural information while extension refers to the set of objects represented by the schema. A concept oft en contains a set of sub-concepts. In machine learning, we can learn the inten sions of concepts or sub-concepts from a set of objects. In supervised learning, every object is labeled with a class in concept. In unsupervised learning, the c lasses of objects can be obtained with a clustering algorithm. In this case, a cluster is a sub-concept.

As the arrival items change over time, the change of data distribution can be used to induce the change of a concept. In real applications, the change of a concept is mainly caused by emerging new sub-concepts or fading old sub-concepts or both. A radical change of a concept is often known as concept drift [2]. Two kinds of concept drift are illustrated in literature [3]. One is sudden (abrupt) concept drift and the other is gradual concept drift. Sudden concept drift is described as that the data distribution is dramatically changed in a short time period. Gradual concept dri ft is considered that the change of a concept occurs gradually over time. For example, in social network analysis, different groups of people are interested in different topics. Some people may gradually change their interests from one topic to another over time and some may suddenly change their interests to new topics.

To investigate the behaviors of such data streams, we concern whether the concept at time t 2 has drifted from the concept at time t 1 ,where t 2 &gt;t 1 . Meantime, we are interested in the change speed of concepts.

In this paper, we propose a new method to measure the difference between two concepts at the different time points. This difference is defined by approx-imation accuracy of rough set theory. B ased on the new measure, we propose a concept-drifting detection algorithm to detect whether a concept has drifted or not. We have conducted a series of experiments on the KDD-CUP X 99 data. The experimental results have demonstrated the proposed algorithm is not only effective in discovering the changes of concepts but also efficient in processing large data sets. as indiscernibility relation, lower and upper approximations, approximation ac-curacy that are used to define the mea sures of concept change. We then define the problem of concept-drifting in the categorical time-evolving data. 2.1 Some Basic Concepts of Rough Set Theory represents an object and each column rep resents an attribute that describes the objects. Formally, a data table can be defined as a quadruple DT =( U,A,V,f ), where U is a nonempty set of objects called the universe and A is a nonempty is the union of all attribute domains. If V is represented by continuous values, then DT is called a numerical data table. For any a  X  A ,if V a is finite and DT represents a categorical data table in this paper.

Let DT be a categorical data table defined on A and P  X  A . P defines an equivalence relation IND ( P )as:
As any equivalence relation induces a partition of the universe, these partitions can be used to build new subsets of the universe. These notions can be formally expressed as follows.

Let DT =( U,A,V,f ) be a categorical data table, P  X  A and X  X  U .One can approximate X using only the information in P by constructing the lower approximation and the upper approximation of X , denoted as P X and PX respectively, where P X = { x | [ x ] P  X  X } and PX = { x | [ x ] P X =  X  X  .
The objects in P X can be classified with certainty as members of X on the members of X .Theset BN P ( X )= PX  X  P X is called the P -boundary region of X , and consists of those objects that cannot be decisively classified into X on the basis of knowledge in P .Theset U  X  PX is called the P -outside region of X and consists of those objects which can not belong to X certainly. A set is said to be rough if the boundary region is non-empty.

A rough set can be characterized numerically by the following term which is called the approximation accuracy, where | X | denotes the cardinality said to be rough with respect to P , i.e., X is vague with respect to P . 2.2 Problem Statement Similarly, a categorical time-evolving data can also be stored in a table. For-mally, a categorical time-evolving data table [5] can be formulated as a quin-tuple TDT =( U,A,V,f,t ),where U , A and V are the same as those in DT . The information function f : U  X  A  X  t  X  V is a mapping such that for any x  X  U and a  X  A , f ( x,a,t )  X  V In order to detect the change of concepts, we adopt the sliding window technique evolving data table. Suppose that N is the sliding window size, then the TDT S S In this section, we define the lower approximation and upper approximation of aset Y with respect to a data set X instead of a universe U in rough set theory. we formulate a set of measures for changes of concepts, including the degrees and speeds of a new concept emerging and a old concept emerging as well as the speed of change between two concepts. 3.1 Measures of Concepts Changes To formulate the change of a concept, we define the lower approximation and upper approximation of a set as Definition 1. Let TDT =( U,A,V,f,t ) be a categorical time-evolving data ta-ble, P  X  A and X  X  U . For any Y  X  X and x  X  X , the lower approximation and upper approximation of Y with respect to X are defined as and where [ x ] P = { y  X  X | ( x,y )  X  IND ( P ) } .
 Here, the lower approximation and upper approximation of Y are defined with respect to X , not to the universe U .

Given a categorical data steam that ca rries a set of concepts at different time points, at a particular time point, a concept contains a set of sub-concepts and the concept changes as sub-concepts ch ange over time. For example, in social and the topic changes as a new subtopic emerges or an old subtopic disappears at the following time points. We use an intuitive example in Fig.1 to illustrate three types of concept change.

Assume the two rectangles in each sub figure of Fig.1 represent a concept at disappeared at t 2 from the concept. In Fig.1(c), two old sub-concepts faded and two new sub-concepts emerged.
 Using the definitions of lower approximation and upper approximation in Definition 1, we define the measures for degrees and speeds of new concept emerging and old concept fading in categorical evolving data as follows. Definition 2. Let TDT =( U,A,V,f,t ) be a categorical time-evolving data table concepts emerging degree and old concepts fading degree from S T i to S T j with respect to A are defined as and where mation of S T m in S [ T i ,T j ] with respect to attribute a .

The speed of concept drifting was used [9]. In this paper, we use speed to measure the amount of concept change from t 1 to t 2 . The speeds of new concept emerging and old concept fading are defined as follows. Definition 3. Let TDT =( U,A,V,f,t ) be a categorical time-evolving data table concepts emerging speed and old concepts fading speed from S T i to S T j with respect to A are defined as and By considering the degrees of new con cept emerging and old concept fading together, we define the degree and speed of change between two concepts as: Definition 4. Let TDT =( U,A,V,f,t ) be a categorical time-evolving data table as and Property 1. Let TDT =( U,A,V,f,t ) be a categorical time-evolving data table. (2) Nonnegativity: CD A ( S T i ,S T j )  X  0; and Example 1. We use the simple categorical time-evolving data set in Table 1 to show the procedure of computing the degree of change between two concepts. The speed of change can be computed similarly.
 { x Using Definition 1, we calculate According to Definition 2, we calculate Using Definition 3 and Definition 4, we obtain With similar computations, we obtain We can compare the degrees of change at consecutive windows as windows.
 pute the speeds of changes NES A , OFS A and CS A between consecutive sliding windows using Definition 3 and Definition 4, as shown in Table 2.
 3.2 Concept-Drifting Detecting Algorithm From the above definitions, drifting of a concept can be detected by compar-ing the degree of change against a given threshold. As a result, a concept-drifting detection algorithm CDDA is developed as shown in Algorithm 1. The key step of CDDA is to compute the degree of change between two consec-O ( that the time complexity of CDDA is linear with respect to the number of the objects in X . 4.1 Data Set We used the 10% subset version of the KDD-CUP X 99 Network Intrusion Detec-tion stream data set [10] to test the CDDA algorithm. The Network Intrusion Algorithm 1. The concept-drifting detection algorithm 1: Input: 2: -TDT =( U,A,V,f,t ):thedataset, 3: -N : the size of sliding window, 4: - X  : the specified threshold value, 5: Output: Driftingwindow; 6: Method: 7: Driftingwindow=  X  ; 8: for i =1 to $ | U | N % X  1 do 10: Driftingwindow=Driftingwindow { i +1 } ; 11: end if 12: end for Detection data set consists of a series o f TCP connection records from two weeks of LAN network traffic data managed by MIT Lincoln Labs. Each record corre-sponded to either a normal connection or an intrusion (or attack). The attacks include 22 types. In the following experiments, all 22 attack-types are seen as  X  X ttack X . In this data set, there are 494,021 records and each record contains 42 attributes (class label is included). We discretized the 34 numerical attributes using the uniform quantization method and each attribute was quantized into 5 discrete values. 4.2 Concept-Drifting Detection The size of the sliding windows and the given threshold are two parameters that affect the detection of concept drifting. We conducted a series experiments to investigate the settings of these two p arameters. The experiment results are presented as follows.
 Experiment 1. In this experiment, the threshold was set to 0.01 and the size of the sliding windows changed from 1000 to 30000 with a step length of 1000. The variations of the number of drifting-concepts with respect to the class label and the attribute set are shown in Fig.2.

From Fig.2, we can see that the number o f drifting-concepts decreased with increase of the sliding window size.
 Experiment 2. In this experiment, the size of the sliding window was set to 3000 and the threshold changed from 0.01 to 1 with a step length of 0.01. The number of drifting-concepts changed as threshold changed with respect to the class label and the attribute set. The result is shown in Fig.3.

From Fig.3, we can see that the change rate on the number of drifting-concepts over the threshold with respect to the attribute set is greater than that with respect to the class label. To make the num ber of drifting-concepts with respect set, the threshold with respect to the class label should be greater than the threshold with respect to the attribut e set. In practice, a user can choose a threshold according to a prior know ledge or specific requirement.
 Experiment 3. The duration of objects was assumed same in each sliding window and the evolving speeds of concepts in different sliding windows are shown in Fig.4. In this experiment, the size of the sliding window was set to 3000.

In Fig.4, the values of the change speed drop to zero in the range of 51 to 114, 134 to 149, and 155 to 160 because the records are same in these sliding windows of each interval. Detection of concept drifting has become an interesting research topic recently. The problem of detecting c oncept drifts in numerical data was explored in [11, 12]. As for detection of concept drifting in categorical data, a method was butions between two continuous sliding windows from categorical data streams [13]. The shortcoming of the method is the difficulty to set suitable system parameters for different applications. In [14], a framework was presented for de-tecting the change of the primary clustering structure which was indicated by the best number of clusters in categorical data streams. However, setting the cult. Nasraoui [15] presented a framework for mining, tracking, and validating evolving multifaceted user profiles whi ch summarize a group of users with sim-as two concepts. Cao [5] used rough set theory to define the distance between two concepts as the difference value of the degree of membership of each object belonging to two different concepts, resp ectively. This method only requires one can only detect the change of concepts, and reasons that cause the change are not considered. In this paper, based on sliding window techniques and approximation accuracy, the change degree and the change speed of concepts have been defined, and a concept-drifting detection algorithm has been proposed. The time complexity analysis and experimental results on a real data set have demonstrated the pro-with respect to input data X .
