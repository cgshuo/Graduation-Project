 1. Introduction
Marine energy is currently a hot topic in renewable and sustainable systems for energy supply ( L X pez et al., 2013; Heras-Saizarbitoria et al., 2013 ). It refers to a set of different technologies that exhibit a clear potential for sustainable growth, do not generate greenhouse gases, and that are potentially able to convert part of the huge energy of oceans into electricity. Some of the marine energy technologies that are currently under exploitation are off-shore wind energy, ocean thermal and tidal and wave energy conversion. Among these technologies, off-shore wind energy is currently the most exploited, but wave energy conver-sion is pushing hard as a new and promising energy source many countries are betting for. In fact, a number of public institutions and companies in British islands ( Lawrence et al., 2013; The Offshore Renewable Energy in Scotland Website; The Pelamis
Wave Power Website ) are aiming at exploiting the huge wave energy resource ( Arinaga and Cheung, 2012; Esteban and Leary, 2012 ), which, according to The Pelamis Wave Power Website ,is equivalent to three times the current UK electricity demand. A review of the major issues involved in the generation of electricity from ocean energy, including wave energy conversion and its related economical aspects, can be found in Bahaj (2011) .
Ocean wave energy is the energy source that converts potential and kinetic energy of waves into electricity, using devices called Wave Energy Converters (WECs) ( Falc X o, 2010; Lindroth and Leijon, 2011;
Alamian et al., 2014 ). WECs transform the energy of waves into electricity by means of either the vertical oscillation of waves or the linear motion of waves, and exhibit some important advantages when compared to the other sources of ocean energy sources: (1) WECs have a much lower impact on ecosystems than tidal devices; (2) there are  X  ideal  X  areas for marine wave energy in Europe (Norway, UK, Ireland, Portugal), North coast o f US and Canada, southern coast of
Australia, northern coast of New Zealand, and Japan (in the sense of having great wave power density located near populated regions demanding energy); (3) wave energy is the most concentrated form of renewable energy (about 1000 times denser than wind) and is less variable on an hourly basis than wind energy; (4) the wave energy resource in a given area can be predicted within hours in advance, though this prediction is dif fi cult because of their stochastic nature and the large amount of factors which in fl uence wave height (meteorology, sea depth, closeness to the coast, etc.). A comprehensive review of these and other bene fi cial properties of WEC-based tech-nologies can be found in Falc X o (2010) .
 compared to tidal energy conversion, however, waves are more dif fi cult to characterise and predict because of their stochastic nature.
Even more, wave energy fl ux can exhibit nonlinear variability, with irregular extreme events ( Reikard, 2013 ). As a consequence of this complexity, wave resource prediction become a crucial topic for the design, deployment, and control of WECs ( Richter et al., 2013; Fusco and Ringwood, 2010a,b ), that require a proper characterisation of waves. Alternative applications of wave height prediction are decision making in operational works at sea, risk evaluation of marine energy facilities, etc. Note that the wave height characterisation can be based on either physical models or data-driven ones. Data for characterising waves can be basically obtained from radars and buoys arrays, which generate time series. Using these time series, the corresponding wave spectrum, S ( f ), can be computed. In turn, based on its spectral moments, a number of wave parameters, which are particularly useful to estimate the wave power density at a given location, can be de
The most important wave parameters in this regard are the signi wave height ( H s )andthe wave energy period ( T e ). Note that the wave's fl ux of energy ( F e ),whichwillbeusedbytheWECinordertogenerate electricity, can be obtained from H s and T e as F e  X  0 : mentioned, waves stochastic nature makes very dif fi cult the prediction of wave energy resource, so the research work on this topic has been intense in the last few years. Focusing on machine learning approaches ( Bishop, 2006 ) to wave energy prediction, most of them use arti neural networks. One of the fi rst approaches to predict H
Deo and Naidu (1998) , who proposed the use of arti fi cial neural networks in this problem. Improvements on this proposed system were presented in a posterior work ( Agrawal and Deo, 2004 ). In Tsai et al. (2002) , H s and T e arepredictedfromtheobservedwaverecords using time series neural networks. In Zanaganeh et al. (2009) (an improvement of Kazeminezhad et al., 2005 ), a hybrid genetic algo-rithm-adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system model was developed to forecast H s and the peak spectral period in Lake Michigan from wind speed, fetch length and wind duration. In this methodol-ogy, both clustering and rule base parameters are simultaneously optimised using genetic algorithms and arti fi cial neural networks.
Recently, in Castro et al. (2015) , a neural network is applied to estimate the wave energy resource in the northern coast of Spain. There have been other works that apply more ef fi cient regression methods, based on machine learning and soft computing ( Mahjoobi et al., 2008 ), such as support vector regression ( Mahjoobi and Mosabbeb, 2009 ), genetic programming ( Nitsure et al., 2012 ) or fuzzy logic (  X zger, 2011 ).
Alternative approaches using numerical models of atmosphere and ocean, usually hybridised with time series prediction, can also be found in the literature ( Reikard et al., 2011; Akpinar and K X m X rc X , 2013 ).
 resolution. Firstly, it is proposed the application of machine learning classi fi eralgorithmsforthisproblem.Thisapproachiscompletely novel, since the previous works had tackled the problem, to the best of our knowledge, by applying regression techniques. Secondly, the problem is tackled as an ordinal multi-class classi fi cation problem, from the point of view that any real variable can be discretised in different categories, reducing the amount of information involved and simplifying this way the problem: a prede fi ned number of ordered categories or ranges in terms of H s or F e is enough for obtaining practical information. The categori es obtained through discretisation of a real value exhibit an order, and this order can be taken into accountbothinclassi fi er construction and evaluation, choosing appropriate performance measures for that ( Verwaeren et al., 2012;
Cruz-Ram X rez et al., 2014; Baccianella et al., 2009 ). Ordinal techniques studied take this consideration, achieving an error in the predictor that usually improves that of nominal classi fi ers. Modelling this prediction problem as a multi-class classi fi cation challenge allows the application of novel and powerful approaches existing in the literature, that have not been discussed before in a problem of marine wave energy prediction. This kind of multi-class classi fi cation problems are some-times referred to as ordinal regression ( Chu and Keerthi, 2007; Sun et al., 2010; Guti X rrez et al., 2012 ) and this work will compare the performance of standard multi-class classi fi ers and ordinal regression ones in this problem of H s and F e prediction. Another novelty of the problem is that the different classi fi cation techniques discussed in this paper are applied by using meteorological predictive variables from global numerical models. Speci fi cally, meteorological data from The
NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project are used in four different grid points around each buoy subjected to study in order to conform the independent variables for H s and F e prediction. For this purpose, a matching procedure is carried out every 6 h between the meteorolo-gical variables obtained from NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project and between H s and F e hourly collected by each buoy, which are obtained from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) ( National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ), belonging to the National Data Buoy
Service of the United States. The performance of the different classi fi ers discussed in this problem has been evaluated in the prediction of H s and F e from real data of a buoy located in the Gulf of Alaska and another one located in the Southeast of United States.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Firstly, the next section brie fl y presents the formulation for an ordinal classi problem. Secondly, the more important ordinal classi fi cation methods in the literature for tackling this problem are described. In Section 4 , the datasets used in this paper, including the buoys and reanalysis data aredetailed.Thespeci fi c problem modelling considered, which includes the estimation/prediction of H s and F e in a 6 h time-horizon, are also stated in this section. Section 5 presents the experimental part of the paper and the results. Finally, Section 6 gives some concluding remarks for closing the paper. 2. Ordinal classi fi cation
The classi fi cation of items into naturally ordered classes is commonly found in many supervised learning problems ( Guti X rrez et al., 2013; S X nchez-Monedero et al., 2014 ), which are referred to as ordinal classi fi cation (also known ordinal regression) problems, where an ordinal scale ( Lippmann, 1989 ) is used to label the patterns  X  for instance, a teacher who rates his/her students using labels (A, B, C, and D) that have a natural order among them (A g B g C g D). However, they are usually tackled by using methods intended for the classi fi cation of nominal classes, where the order relation is not considered.

Taking into account the nature of the problem studied in this paper, different class labels can be de fi ned based on different ranges of H s and F e , in such way that an ordered relationship exists (the smallest to the largest, in increasing order) between the labels (
C 1 ! C 2 !  X  ! C Q , being Q the number of classes or labels). A class with lower order provides less energy than a class with higher order. This ordered rank implies an additional restriction for the classi fi cation problem. As a result, the nominal multi-class classi-fi cation problem turns into an ordinal classi fi cation one.
When the ordinal nature of the target variable is not obvious or has been de fi ned a posteriori, nominal classi fi ers can also be applied to ordinal problems ( Bender and Grouven, 2006 ) and they can even yield better performance. However, they completely ignore the ordering of the labels by considering them as independent classes. This makes them require larger training sets with respect to ordinal approaches ( Kramer et al., 2001 ). Ordinal classi fi ers are speci fi the existing order among classes of the target variable. For classi evaluation, the rank of the label is usually considered, i.e., the position of the label on an ordinal scale, which is usually expressed by the following function O  X  C q  X  X  q ; q A 1 ; 2 ; ... ; Q fg .
Note that H s can be treated in an ordinal manner by assigning labels H 1 ; H 2 ; ... ; H Q to the different (increasing) H Regarding F e , it can also be considered as an ordinal variable, with labels F 1 , F 2 ; ... ; F Q for increasing values of F e H and the corresponding F e are discretised in 4, 5 and 6 different categories, trying to cover the most important kinds of waves from the point of view of their energy production. The ranges for each label in H s and F e are detailed in Section 4 . Then, the more important ordinal classi fi cation methods are used for making predictions in H s and F e in a 6 h time-horizon. These methods are described in the next section. 3. Ordinal classi fi ers
One of the main objectives of this paper is to test several methods to address the prediction of H s and F e as a multi-class classi fi cation problem. To perform a prediction in a 6 h time-horizon, some of the best performing and more commonly used machine learning methods in the literature have been selected ( Guti X rrez et al., 2012 ). All of them provide models to classify ordinal data, generally taking advantage of the order in the labels.
Threshold models are the most common approaches for ordinal to model ordinal regression problems from a thresholded regression perspective, assuming that some underlying real-valued outcomes exist, but they are unobservable. They involve estimating: (1) a projection function f ( x ) that intends to uncover the nature of the assumed underlying outcome; and (2) a threshold vector, as real intervals in one dimension, and the algorithms try to direction to project the patterns and the set of thresholds to divide the real line into consecutive intervals (representing ordinal categories).
From a statistical background, one of the most popular thresh-old methods is the Proportional Odds Model (POM). POM is a logit model that can be viewed quite simply as an extension of logistic regression. The hallmark of the POM is that the odds ratio for a predictor can be interpreted as a summary of the odds ratios obtained from separate binary logistic regressions using all possi-ble cut points ( b ) of the ordinal outcome. This technique allows ordered data to be modelled by analysing it as a number of dichotomies. A binary logistic regression model compares one dichotomy (for example, waves exceeding 4 m or not, energy exceeding 10 kW/m or not, etc.), whereas POM compares a number of dichotomies by arranging the ordered categories into a series of binary comparisons (each binary comparison can be viewed as a separate logistic regression model resulting in Q 1 models). A detailed formulation of this model is available at McCullagh (1980) .

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are the most common kernel classi fi er for statistical pattern recognition ( Cortes and Vapnik, 1995 ). They originally are linear classi fi cation models which select a set of patterns, named as support vectors. By the application of the kernel trick, they can obtain nonlinear decision boundaries. Although they were initially formulated for binary classi problems ( fi nding a maximum margin separating hyperplane that allows to classify two classes), they have been extended for multi-class environments ( Hsu and Lin, 2002 ), ordinal classi fi problems ( Chu and Keerthi, 2007 ) and for standard regression ( Smola and Schlkopf, 2004 ). SVMs have also been adapted to into this generic form of threshold models. Two support vector approaches for Ordinal Regression (SVOR) are proposed in Chu and
Keerthi (2007) . These methods use the threshold vector b , together with parallel hyper-planes which are speci fi ed by a normal vector, w . In order to de fi ne parallel discriminant hyper-planes for the ordinal scales, the SVM approaches share the common objective of seeking Q 1 parallel discriminant hyper-planes represented by a common vector w and the scalars biases, b , to properly separate training data into ordered classes: (1) SVOR with Explicit constraints (SVOR-EX), based on de fi ning a quadratic programming problem where the last set of constraints assuring the order between the thresholds explicitly appears in the opti-misation problem and where the slacks for the q -th parallel hyperplane are de fi ned for all patterns of class q and q  X  1; and (2) SVOR with Implicit constraints (SVOR-IM), based on rede again the quadratic programming problem, following this princi-ple: instead of considering only the errors from the samples of adjacent categories, samples in all the categories are allowed to contribute errors for each hyperplane. In this way, the ordinal inequalities on the thresholds are implicitly satis fi ed at the optimal solution.

Another method reformulated to tackle ordinal regression is the discriminant analysis ( Sun et al., 2010 ). Discriminant analysis is usually not considered as a classi fi cation technique by itself, but rather as a supervised dimensionality reduction. Nonetheless, it is widely used for that purpose, since, as a projection method, the de fi nition of thresholds can be used to discriminate the classes. In general, to allow the computation of the optimal projection for the data, this algorithm analyses two main objectives: the maximisa-tion of the between-class distance, and the minimisation of the within-class distance, by using variance-covariance matrices and the Rayleigh coef fi cient. To export this idea to ordinal regression, only one projection vector is optimised and a minimum separation constraint is imposed on the closest projections of points of contiguous pairs of classes, leading to a proper ordering of the patterns. This preserves the ordinal information and avoid some serious ordinal misclassi fi cation errors. The methodology (in its kernel version) is known as Kernel Discriminant Learning for Ordinal Regression (KDLOR) ( Sun et al., 2010 ).

In machine learning, a recent and very popular algorithm to obtain single-layer feedforward neural networks is the Extreme Learning
Machines (ELMs) ( Huang et al., 2012 ). In this algorithm input weights of an Single-Hidden Layer Feedforward Network (SLFN) can be randomly chosen (according to any con tinuous sampling distribution), and the output weights of the SLFN can be analytically determined by the minimum norm least-squares solutions. Since there are no iterative steps, the training speed of ELM can be hundreds of times faster than traditional gradient-based learning algorithms. ELMs have demonstrated good scalability and generalisation performance. ELMs have been adapted to ordinal regression (ELMOR) ( Deng et al., 2010 ), considering the ordinal relationship among categories. The key of
ELMOR is applying the output coding strategy of Frank and Hall (2001) , that imposes the class ordering restriction. In the ELMOR algorithm with a single ELM classi fi er, the encoding for ordinal regression is implemented with Q output nodes where Q is the number of ranks or intervals. For each training example x ,thetarget the categories, if a data point x belongs to the q -th rank, it is automatically classi fi ed into lower-order categories  X  1 thetargetoutputof x is encoded as t  X  X  1 ; 1 ; ... ; 1 ; 1 where t i  X  1 r i r q  X  is set to 1 and other elements 1. The output coding matrix is a Q Q matrix where the number of coding bits is equal to the number of ranks Q .The q -th row represents the output coding vector of q -th rank, and every column represents one output coding bit corresponding to an output node.
 tion by data replication methods in what is known as augmented binary classi fi cation ( Lin and Li, 2012 ), using the output coding strategy in Frank and Hall (2001) , and an extension, replication and speci fi c weighting of the obtained patterns. In Cardoso and da Costa (2007) , a technique known as Ordinal Neural Networks (ONN), based in applying this replication method to neural net-works, is used for ordinal multi-classi fi cation tasks. The activation function of the output node of a neural network is set to the logsig function and the model is trained to predict the posterior prob-abilities when fed with the original input variables and the variables generated by the data replication method. 4. Obtaining the datasets from two sources: 1. H s and T e as standard meteorological data collected by the sensors 2. Meteorological variables from The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis meteorological variables for each of the four points around each buoy.
H s and F e aretheobjectivevariables. F e is calculated from H , and it is detailed in the next subsection. With these two data sources a matching procedure is carried out: th e meteorological variables on the one hand, and H s and F e on the other. The following subsections explainthisindetail.
 ological data from the buoys are extracted from January 1st (00:00) to December 31st (23:00), for the years 2012 and 2013. 4.1. Selecting the buoys hourly in the NDBC where they are stored in downloadable annual text fi les. Two buoys from the NDBC with a suf fi cient range of values for H s and F e have been selected to validate the performance of machine learning classi fi ers: Station 46001 (LLNR 984) ( National Data Buoy Center )  X 
Western Gulf of Alaska  X  175NM SE of Kodiak, AK. Geographical location: 56.304N 147.920W (56 1 18 0 16  X  X  N 147 1 55 0 13 location lies in the northern extra-tropical storm belt, and, as a result, it is a region of active wave generation. It is a deep-water buoy in which the average height of waves is very high. Station 41013 (LLNR 815) ( National Data Buoy Center ) -Frying
Pan Shoals, NC Buoy. Geographical location: 33.436N 77.743W the USA, and it is a near-shore buoy, with a smaller average height of waves than in the previous buoy considered.

For each selected buoy, it is possible to obtain the value of energy fl ux considering H s (measured in meters ) and T e in seconds ) as follows:
F  X  0 : 49 H 2 s T e ;  X  1  X  where F e is the energy fl ux generated by the waves measured in kilowatts per meter . Note that H s and F e are the two physical phenomena to be predicted in this study. Note also that F de fi ned in Eq. (1) as an average energy fl ux ( H s is a kind of average wave height), though for simplicity it will be referred just as energy fl ux .

The objective variables ( H s and F e ) must be discretised in order to tackle the problem as a classi fi cation one. The minimum and maximum values of H s and F e are 0.43  X  11.14 m and 0.31 665.85 kW/m, respectively, for the buoy in the Gulf of Alaska, and 0.34  X  6.21 m and 0.25  X  158.16 kW/m, for the buoy in the
Southeast of United States. To check out how the change in the discretisation of H s and F e can affect the prediction task, datasets with different number of classes according to the thresholds used for each one have been built. Considering the expert knowledge about the problem, the threshold values used were selected trying to obtain the most representative classes of the behaviour of the waves for each station and geographical location. Note that this discretisation may be adjustable depending on each speci fi situation, i.e., depending on the normal sea conditions where the
WEC is installed, and even the WEC type. Note also that the inclusion of many different classes may compromise the perfor-mance of the classi fi cation task. Tables 1  X  3 show the class thresh-olds for 4, 5 and 6 classes respectively for each buoy and for H and F e . 4.2. Meteorological data grid
The well-known NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project ( Kalnay et al., 1996 ) is a joint project between the National Centers for Environ-mental Prediction (NCEP) and the National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR), at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-istration (NOAA)/Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) Physi-cal Sciences Division ( The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project ). The goal of this joint effort was to produce new atmospheric analyses using historical data (1948 onwards) and as well to produce analyses of the current atmospheric state (Climate Data Assimilation System, CDAS). Reanalysis data have been used in surface for tackling this problem of H s and F e prediction. For each meteorological data listed above (air temperature, sea level pressure, the zonal com-ponent of the wind and the meridional component of the wind), the four closest points around of each buoy have been selected, obtaining a meteorological data sub-grid within the following ranges:
Station 46001 (LLNR 984): 55.0  X  57.5 grades North for latitude and 145.5  X  150.0 grades West for longitude. Therefore, the observations for each of the physical variables were taken from the following points (latitude N, longitude E): (55.0N, 210.0E), (55.0N, 212.5E), (57.5N, 210.0E) and (57.5N, 212.5E). Fig. 1 shows an approximate representation of the four grid points around the buoy. For the next buoy, Station 41013, the repre-sentation is similar.

Station 41013 (LLNR 815): 32.5  X  35.0 grades North for latitude and 77.5  X  80.0 grades West for longitude. Therefore, for this buoy, the physical observations selected are in each of the following geographic points (latitude N, longitude E): (32.5N, 280.0E), (32.5N, 282.5E), (35.0N, 280.0E) and (35.0N, 282.5E). Reanalysis Meteorological data are stored in The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project web page 6-hourly, daily and monthly, and they can be extracted in fi les with Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) ( Unidata ) format ( .nc extension), a special type of for representing scienti fi c data. The data have been extracted with a time horizon of 6 h because it is the minimum temporal resolution of the Reanalysis data used. In addition, a time horizon of 6 h seems a more reasonable time for detecting changes in sea conditions. Note, however, that the system can be trained with different prediction time horizons, depending on the fi nal objec-tive of this prediction.

The NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project web page allows you to select a range of years for a meteorological variable within a geographic grid arranged every 2.5 1 . Hence, as the four closest geographic points to each buoy were needed, it has been neces-sary to extract a NetCDF fi le for each the four meteorological variables. In other words, each fi le extracted contains the values for one meteorological variable in the four closest geographical points around one buoy for the years 2012  X  2013. Once obtained the NetCDF fi les, a Java software using a NetCDF-Java library (implemented by us) was used to obtain, for each buoy, the input variables of our problem, so that a pattern is formed by the values of air temperature, sea level pressure, the zonal component of the wind and the meridional component of the wind in each one of the four closest to the buoy at a speci fi c time, taken every 6 h.
Then, a matching every 6 h is done with respect to H s and F (which are taken hourly) for each buoy. This is also done automatically by the Java software implemented. Consequently, for an speci fi c discretisation (number of classes), for each buoy, two datasets are considered, one for H s and another for F 4.3. Final composition of the datasets
In this subsection, some problems found during the composi-tion of the datasets are discussed.

It has been necessary to carry out a preprocessing for cleaning the data ( H s and T e ) extracted for each buoy from the NDBC web page, removing missing hours and invalid data. The data extracted from the buoys are stored hourly, thereby, the total number of hourly measurements, taking into account the number of days in each month and if the year is leap, should be 8784 for 2012 and 8760 for 2013. On the other hand, although a buoy has measure-ments at a speci fi c time, the measured values can be null. If it happens, null values are marked in the downloadable annual text fi les with the value 99.00. That said, at the Station 46001
Western Gulf of Alaska, the null values plus complete missing hours for 2012 and 2013 are a total of 361 hourly measurements.
For the Station 41013  X  Southeast of United States there are a total of 57 hourly measurements less. Compared with the 17544 (8784  X  8760) possible measurements for the years 2012  X  2013 the number of missing patterns is less than 2.5%. Note that these missing values may be even less because the matching with meteorological variables is 6-hourly. In this case, if there is no data for a certain hourly date and time in the buoy, then the pattern is discarded.

Regarding the meteorological variables, as the measurements are taken 6-hourly, the total number of measurements for 2012 are 1464 (8784/6) and for 2013 are 1460 (8760/6), so that, the maximum number of patters for each buoy in the years 2012 2013 could be 1464  X  1460  X  2924. Considering all these factors, the total number of patterns obtained for prediction, joining 2012 and 2013, are 2759 for the Station 46001  X  Western Gulf of Alaska and 2920 for the Station 41013  X  Southeast of United States. The (55.0 N 147.5 W) (57.5 N 147.5 W) characteristics of the datasets, taking into account the number of classes in the discretisation procedure, are shown in Table 4 . (Station 46001), using 4 classes. The structure for F e is similar, changing the objective variable. 5. Experiments majority of methods used in the comparison procedure are deterministic, a strati fi ed holdout with 30 random splits is performed, where approximately 75% of the instances were used for the training set and the remaining 25% for the test or general-isation set, maintaining the original distribution of classes. The objective of this design is to evaluate the results as a function of the different training/test splits.
 important and relevant nominal algorithms based on Support
Vector Machine methodology are considered (which do not take the class order into account) to compare the problem under study.
Furthermore, a well-known regression method is also added to the comparison in order to study the performance of regression techniques in predicting H s and F e . In this way, all possible approach types (regression, classi fi cation and ordinal classi tion) have been included in the comparison.
 difference with ordinal methods. SVM methodologies can be said to be the best performing algorithms in machine learning to handle binary classi fi cation. The 1 versus 1 (SVC1V1) and 1 versus all (SVC1VA) approaches ( Hsu and Lin, 2002 ) are considered, because they are the two main approaches when applying SVM to multiclass problems. In the SVC1V1 method, a binary SVM classi fi er is built for each pair of classes, resulting in Q  X  Q 1  X 
SVMs trained to differentiate the patterns of one class from those of another class. The classi fi cation of unseen patterns is carried out according to the majority voting strategy, each SVM is considered to be a voting and the pattern is designated to be in a class with the maximum number of votes. The SVC1VA method constructs Q classi fi ers, where the i th SVM is trained with all the samples in i th class with positive labels, and all other examples with negative ones. As having a total of Q decision functions, a pattern is assigned to the class which has the largest value of the decision function. SVC1VA tries to maximise the margin between two groups of data and when date are not linear separable, a penalty term for reducing the number of training error is used. The basic concept behind SVM is to search for a balance between a regularisation term and the training errors.
 With respect to the regression technique, a Support Vector
Machine algorithm (the Support Vector Regression, SVR, method) is used in the comparison. Concretely, the  X  -SVR model considered in Smola and Schlkopf (2004) is considered, one of the best performing implementations in this context. The actual values of
H and F e are used for training the regressor. During the test phase, the predictions are discretised into 4, 5 or 6 classes to compare the accuracy of the method with respect to the rest of algorithms. For this, the thresholds de fi ned in Tables 1  X  3 are considered.
The hyperparameters for each method were selected by using a nested fi vefold cross-validation over the training set and taking into account the lowest cross-validation error obtained with respect to the
Mean Absolute Error performance (see Section 5.1 ), MAE ,inorderto favour better ordering classi fi er. The parameter con fi following:
The kernel function considered for all kernel methods (SVOREX, SVORIM, SVR, KDLOR, SVC1V1 and SVC1VA) was the Gaussian function. For every tested kernel method, the kernel width was selected within these values  X  A 10 3 ; 10 2 ; ... ; 10 3 g .

The POM algorithm is used with the logit link function, the most extended one.

The range of  X  (width of the tube within which no penalty is associated in the training loss function) for  X  -SVR was  X  A 10 0 ; 10 1 ; ... ; 10 3
The cost parameter C of all SVM methods was selected within the range C A 10 3 ; 10 2 ; ... ; 10 3 odology, within the range C A 10 1 ; 10 0 ; 10 1 meter to avoid singularities in the covariance matrices for KDLOR was considered within the range u A 10 6 ; 10 3 ; 10 2 g .

For the ONN methodology, the sigmoidal activation function is used and the number of nodes in the hidden layer was allowed values in the range 5 ; 10 ; 15 ; ... ; 40 fg .
 For ELMOR, a higher numbers of hidden neurons is considered,
H A 5 ; 10 ; 20 ; ... ; 100 fg , given that it relies on suf mative random projections ( Huang et al., 2012 ). 5.1. Performance evaluation
Metrics speci fi cally designed to measure the degree of discre-pancy (in the ordinal scale) between the predicted and real categories are needed to evaluate classi fi ers for ordinal regression problems. There are different alternatives ( Cardoso and da Costa, 2007; Cruz-Ram X rez et al., 2014; Baccianella et al., 2009 ), and there is an agreement that, in an ordinal regression problem, the aim is to evaluate two factors: whether the patterns are generally well classi fi ed, and whether the classi fi er tends to predict a class as close to the real class as possible.

Let us suppose an ordinal classi fi cation problem with Q classes and n patterns with a classi fi er g obtaining a Q Q confusion matrix. n jk represents the number of times the patterns are predicted by classi fi er g to be in class k when they really belong to class j and n is the total number of patterns. From this assumptions, the Correct Classi fi cation Rate ( CCR ) or accuracy (the most common metric for measuring the performance of a nominal classi fi er) can be obtained as CCR  X  1 n where CCR values range from 0 to 1.

On the other hand, MAE metric is de fi ned as the average absolute deviation of the predicted class from the true class (i.e., deviation in number of categories of the ordinal scale). This measure allows to check out whether the classi fi er tends to predict a class as close to the real class as possible: MAE  X  1 n or class in the ordinal rank. Then, MAE values range from 0 to Q 1. 5.2. Results
Table 5 shows the averages ( Mean ) and the standard deviations ( SD ), for H s and F e at the Station 46001  X  Gulf of Alaska, of the test errors for the 30 models generated (one for each strati fi from the different machine learning classi fi ers compared. This table shows the results for 4, 5 and 6 classes. As a reference, the accuracy obtained by random guessing are CCR  X  33 : 3 % for 3 classes, CCR  X  25 : 0 % for 4 classes and CCR  X  16 : 6 % for 6 classes. Because of this, and given that there are several external factors not included in the dataset (sea depth, closeness to the coast, etc.), which can increase the uncertainty and the noise in the variable to be predicted, the results obtained can be considered as satisfactory. It must be noted that the models obtained are trained in data-driven fashion, leading to very good accuracy results. However, they do not allow a direct physical interpretation, because they are highly nonlinear and the relations between the input variab les include several interactions.
From a descriptive point of view, the best result in CCR for predicting H s considering a discretisati on of 4 classes is obtained by the SVOREX method, which obtains a value of 60.836 7 1.212; and the second best result is obtained by the method SVC1V1, with a value of 60.758 7 1.499. With respect to the MAE metric, the best result is obtained again by the SVOREX methodology, with a value of 0.414 7 0.012, and the second best result changes, being obtained by the SVORIM methodology with a value of 0.416 7 0.012. In the case of
F , the best result in CCR is also obtained by SVOREX method, with a value of 58.014 7 1.813, and the second best result is also obtained by the SVC1V1 method, with a value of 57.821 7 1.612. Concerning the
MAE metric, the best result is for the SVORIM method, with a value of 0.467 7 0.019, and the second best result is obtained by the SVOREX method, with a value of 0.467 7 0.022. Note that these results are very similar, except that the variance of the SVORIM method is slightly lower than the SVOREX method. Summarising, the best results in CCR for H s and F e are obtained by the SVOREX method and the best results in MAE for H s and F e are obtained by the SVOREX and SVORIM methods.

For 5 and 6 classes, the prediction of H s and F e is worse in terms of CCR and MAE . Thus, for 5 classes, the best result in H obtained by the SVOREX method both in CCR and MAE .For 6 classes, the best result for H s and F e is obtained by the SVOREX and SVORIM method in CCR and MAE respectively.
 ( SD ), for H s and F e at the Station 41013  X  Southeast of United States, of the test errors for the 30 models generated (one for each strati fi ed hold-out) from the different machine learning classi compared. This table shows the results for 4, 5 and 6 classes. predicting H s considering a discretisation of 4 classes is obtained by the SVOREX method, which obtains a value of 65.169 7 1.703; and the second best result is obtained by the method SVORIM, with a very similar value of 65.128 7 1.794. With respect to the MAE metric, this fact is reversed, the best result is obtained by the SVORIM methodol-ogy, with a value of 0.359 7 0.018, and the second best result is obtained by the SVOREX methodology with a value of 0.360 7 thecaseof F e ,thebestresultin CCR is obtained by the SVC1V1 method, with a value of 53.904 7 1.816, and the second best result is also obtained by the SVORIM method, with a value of 52.890
Concerning the MAE metric, the best result is for the SVORIM method, with a value of 0.505 7 0.015, and the second best result is obtained by the SVOREX method, with a value of 0.515 7 0.015. Summarising, the best results in CCR for H s and F e are obtained by the methods SVOREX and SVC1V1, respectively, and the best results in MAE for H always obtained by the SVORIM method.

For 5 and 6 classes, the prediction of H s and F e is also worse in terms of CCR and MAE . Thus, for 5 classes and H e , the best result is obtained by the SVOREX and SVORIM methods in CCR and MAE , respectively. For the prediction of F e , the best result is obtained by the SVORIM method both in CCR and MAE . For 6 classes and H best result is obtained by the SVOREX and SVORIM methods in CCR and MAE , and for F e , the SVC1V1 method obtains the best result in CCR and the SVORIM method obtains the best result in MAE .
The performance for F e prediction is worse than the one obtained for H s . The reason is that this problem does not have such a clear ordinal component as H s , since in F e the contribution of T e is signi fi cant, which makes this variable harder to be predicted. On the other hand, note that the range of F e values is much wider than that of H s , resulting in a higher variance, more dif fi cult to be represented by the model.

In order to better summarise these results, Table 7 shows the test mean rankings in terms of CCR and MAE , for the 9 methods considered in these experiments along all the 12 datasets: 6 data-sets for each buoy, 3 for H s (4, 5 and 6 classes) and 3 for F dataset, a ranking of 1 is given to the best method, in average, and a 9 is given to the worst one. From this table, it can be seen that most support vector methods (except SVR) achieve the best performance. However, ordinal methods, SVOREX and SVORIM, achieve better performance respect to SVC1V1, SVC1VA and SVR, specially in MAE .For CCR , the decomposition of SVC1V1 also achieves a quite good performance, although one should take into account that this measure do no penalise mistakes according to the ordinal scale.

To quantify whether a statistical difference exists among the algorithms compared, a procedure is employed to compare multi-ple classi fi ers in multiple datasets ( Demsar, 2006 ), using the average ranking (for CCR and MAE ) of each method shown in
Table 7 . This procedure begins with a non-parametric Friedman's test, establishing the signi fi cance level at  X   X  0.05. The test rejects the null-hypothesis that all of the algorithms perform similarly in mean ranking for all the metrics. Con fi dence interval, C
F -values, F , for CCR and MAE are F CCR  X  92 : 75 = 2 C F
MAE  X  57 : 87 = 2 C 0 respectively. Note that for CCR the differences are larger.
 On the basis of this rejection and following the guidelines in Demsar (2006) , the best performing methods (i.e., SVOREX and SVORIM) are considered as control methods for the following tests.
These two methods are compared to the rest according to their rankings.Holm'stestisconsidered,whichinvolvescomputingthe following statistics for comparing the average ranks ( R i i -th and j -th method: where J is the number of algorithms and T is the number of datasets.

The hypotheses are ordered by their signi fi according to the p -values. Holm's test compares p i inghypothesisisrejected, p i  X  1 is compared with  X  =  X  J i  X  1  X  .Ifnot, the test ends. The results of the test are included in Table 8 . Several conclusions can be drawn. The results of SVOREX are promising. Concretely, in CCR ,itobtainssigni fi cant differences with respect to all methods except the nominal support vector approaches, SVC1V1 and SVC1VA, and the ordinal support vector approach SVORIM. For the MAE metric, SVOREX also obtains signi fi cant differences with respect to all methods except SVC1V1 and SVORIM methodologies, but, in this case, SVOREX also obtains signi fi cant differences on SVC1VA. If theSVORIMmethodisconsideredasacontrolmethod,itsigni fi -cantly outperforms all other algorithms for MAE (except for SVOREX where non-signi fi cant differences were found), but for CCR ,SVORIM does not statistically outperform the SVOREX method and the nominal support vector approaches, SVC1V1 and SVC1VA. Note again that accuracy is not an appropriate measure for ordinal regression dataset.

That said, generally, the ordinal methods SVOREX and SVORIM are the best election using CCR and MAE as comparison metrics for predicting H s and F e . In the case of CCR , the nominal methods SVC1V1 and SVC1VA also obtain competitive performance. Although regression is the most common approach to tackle this problem in previous works, note that the SVR technique has obtained signi fi cant worse results, indicating that the additional complexity derived from considering the problem as a regression task limits the performance in terms of CCR and MAE . Therefore, the ordinal methodologies are a good option for obtaining a coarse prediction of the wave energy produced by a given WEC, they can be applied to systems at any location and also they can be tuned by the practitioner specialist by just adjusting the labels of the classes, depending on the WEC system managed and the wave zone under study. 6. Conclusions
In this paper eight different ordinal and nominal classi fi one support vector regression algorithm have been evaluated in a problem of marine energy prediction. Speci fi cally, signi height ( H s ) and energy fl ux ( F e )predictionina6htime-horizonis considered. Up until now, this problem had only been tackled with regression techniques, and, to our knowledge, this is the that introduces classi fi cation techniques in marine energy prediction.
Moreover, the prediction of H s and F e is carried out by using meteorological input variables, from weather numerical models, including four grid points surrounding the considered WEC, what is also a novelty in these type of forecasting problems. The results obtained have shown that ordinal classi fi erssuchasSVOREXand
SVORIM obtain a good reconstruction in terms of H s with respect to nominal classi fi cation and regression methods, taking into account the dif fi culty of the problem. These approaches are less accurate when F e is considered as the objective variable, because of the contribution of the T e component, but SVOREX and SVORIM also get the best results compared to other methods. Nominal methods,
SVC1VA and SVC1V1, obtain in some cases similar results in terms of prediction accuracy (although this measure is not appropriate for range prediction problems), but they obtain worse results than ordinal methods for metrics which consider the severity of the error committed. The methodologies proposed in this paper based on multi-class classi fi cation are novel for marine energy prediction, and allows to tune the algorithms and even thresholds classes depending on the WEC system or zone under study, in order to improve the performance of the prediction system.
