 Temporal and spatial information in text documents is of-ten expressed in a qualitative way. Moreover, both are fre-quently affected by vagueness, calling for appropriate ex-tensions of traditional frameworks for qualitative reasoning about time and space. Our research aims at defining such extensions based on fuzzy set theory, and applying the re-sulting frameworks to two important kinds of intelligent in-formation retrieval, viz. temporal question answering and geographic information retrieval.

Two particularly interesting examples are temporal question answering (QA) systems, which provide answers to temporally restricted questions like What major conflicts took place during the Cold War? , and geographic information retrieval (GIR) systems, which support geographically constrained queries like hotels in the old centre of Amsterdam . Such systems rely heavily on temporal and spatial information found in text documents, which is often affected by vagueness. For example, the time spans of many events (e.g. the Cold War, the Great Depres-sion, the Dotcom Bubble, etc.) and the spatial extent of many regions (e.g. the Alps, Amsterdam X  X  old centre, West-ern Europe, etc.) are characterized by inherently gradual boundaries, while metric information tends to be expressed in an approximate way (e.g. the hotel is located within walking distance of the Dam Square).

In our work, we have defined a generalization of the Inter-val Algebra [1] and the Region Connection Calculus [2] to model vague temporal and vague spatial information respec-tively [5, 3], using fuzzy set theory as the underlying frame-work for representing vagueness. We have furthermore in- X
