Researchers working in technical disciplines wishing to search for information related to a particul ar mathematical expression cannot effectively do so with a text-based search engine unless they know appropriate text keywords. To overcome this difficulty, we demonstrate a math-aware search engine, which extends the capability of existing text search engines to search mathematical content . Our search engine is composed of a MathFind processing layer implemented on top of a typical text -based search engine layer. Our prototype piggybacks upon the Apache Lucene Search API, a modified vector space model-based text retrieval system. The MathFind layer of the search engine analyzes expressions in MathML, an XML standard for representing mathematical notation. The process decomposes the mathematical expression into a sequence of text-encode d math fragments. These math fragments are analogous to word s in a text document. Math fragments combined with text cont ent serve as input to the text-search engine. At query time, a graphical equation editor is used to enter a math query, which is internally represented in MathML. The math-processing layer converts the MathML query into a sequence of text-encoded math query terms, which form the basis of a text query performed by the underlying text-search engine. To overcome the ambiguity in the presentation of an expression, MathML input is normalized before processing. [1, 2] The current implementation has the following features
