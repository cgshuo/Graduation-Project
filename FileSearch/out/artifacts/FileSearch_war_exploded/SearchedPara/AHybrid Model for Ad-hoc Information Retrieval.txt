 Many information retrieval (IR) techniques have been pro-posed to improve the performance, and some combinations of these techniques has been demonstrated to be e ective. However, how to e ectively combine them is largely unex-plored. It is possible that a method reduces the positive in uence of the other one even if both of them are e ective separately. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid model which can simply and exibly combine components of three di erent IR techniques under a uniform framework. Exten-sive experiments on the TREC standard collections indicate that our proposed model can outperform the best TREC systems consistently in the ad-hoc retrieval. It shows that the combination strategy in our proposed model is very ef-fective. Meanwhile, this method is also re-useable for other researchers to test whether their new methods are additive to the current technologies.
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Retrieval models, Relevance feedback Algorithms, Performance, Experimentation Hybrid Model, Rocchio's Relevance Feedback
In the past thirty years, researchers make great progress in the Information Retrieval (IR) area. A plenty of new technologies, e.g., stemming, query expansion and smooth-ing methods, have been introduced and help to obtain bet-ter performance in retrieving relevant documents. Some at-tempts to combine these technologies show that the strategy of combination is very important because one technology can counteract the a ects of others. However, how to make an e ective combination is still largely unexplored, especially under a uni ed framework.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid model to incorporate three di erent retrieval techniques that have proven to be e ective for the ad-hoc retrieval on the TREC collections. We analyze the best TREC systems for ad-hoc retrieval, and extend the Rocchio's feedback method by incorporating three kinds of IR techniques, which are proximity, feedback document quality estimation and query performance predic-tion techniques, under the pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) framework to boost the overall performance. We mainly focus on how to re ne the representation of the query un-der the PRF framework in order to avoid the drawbacks of traditional PRF methods. Experimental results on various TREC datasets show that our hybrid model consistently ob-tains better results over the best TREC systems. Because our proposed model is component-based, it is very exible to import di erent techniques in the future. Meanwhile, the hybrid model can help researchers to test whether their methods are additive to improve the overall performance of ad-hoc retrieval which was mentioned in [1].
Rocchio's algorithm [4] is a classic framework for imple-menting (pseudo) relevance feedback via improving the query representation. When the negative feedback documents are ignored, the traditional Rocchio's model is as follows: where Q 0 and Q 1 represent the original and rst iteration query vectors, R is the set of (pseudo) relevance documents, and r is the expansion term weight vector.

Although the Rocchio's model has been introduced for many years, it is still e ective in obtaining relevant doc-uments. According to [7], \BM25 term weighting coupled with Rocchio feedback remains a strong baseline which is at least as competitive as any language modeling approach for many tasks". Meanwhile, it is very exible to adapt additional components. However, the traditional Rocchio's model can still be reformed to be better. First, the query term proximity information which has proven to be useful is not considered. Second, Rocchio's algorithm views terms from di erent feedback documents equally. Intuitively, a candidate expansion term in a document with better qual-ity is more likely to be relevant to the query topic. Third, the interpolation parameter is always xed across a group of queries. In fact, for a well expressed query, the candidate feedback documents are always more reliable for relevance feedback. In this paper, we use a regression model to predict this interpolation parameter. In order to alleviate in uence of these problems, we extend Rocchio's algorithm which re-nes the query representation as follows.

Q 1 = ( Q 0 +(1 ) Q p )+(1 ) where controls how much we rely on the query term prox-imity information [5], controls how much we rely on the original query, Q p is an n-gram of original query terms and q ( d r ) is the quality score of document d .

As we can see from Equation 2, our proposed algorithm is very exible and can evaluate di erent techniques. In this paper, we adopt the co-occurrence interpretation of term proximity to compute Q p , where the proximity among query terms is represented by the n-gram frequencies and BM25 is used as the weighting model [2].
 Full dependencies of query terms are taken into account. For the document quality factor q ( d r ), we simple use the scores from the rst-pass retrieval for approximation as in [6]. For the prediction to , we use the same features as in [3] to train the regression model. The di erence is that we do it within Rocchio's framework.
We conduct experiments on three representative test col-lections: disk1&amp;2, disk4&amp;5, and GOV2, which are used in di erent TREC years. We present the results for each TREC year such that we can directly compare our results with the best TREC systems. Detailed information about the TREC datasets and the evaluation criteria, please refer to http://trec.nist.gov. For the preprocessing of the collec-tions, we use the Porter Stemmer and a stopword list. In addition, we only use the title part of the topics to retrieve.
In our experiments, we rst empirically evaluate di er-ent combinations of our implemented component techniques, then evaluate how these techniques perform when they are integrated in our hybrid model. We set the parameters to xed values in a parsimonious way such that each compo-nent technique gets considerable improvements on most col-lections. In other words, there is still room for improvement if the parameters are tuned on a collection-by-collection ba-sis. Particularly, for the basic retrieval model, we use the Okapi BM25 model, and set b in BM25 to 0.3. When only the query term proximity technique is added, denoted as \BM25+Prox", we set to 0.3. In addition, when query expansion and document quality estimation techniques are added, denoted as \Hybrid-Fixed", we empirically set , j R to 0.5 and 30. However, when the query performance pre-diction technique is used, denoted as \Hybrid-Reg", is not xed. But it is obtained from a regression model that is trained as in [3]. When evaluating our hybrid model for a particular TREC year, the queries in the remainder TREC years on the same collection are used as training data.
From Table 1, we can see that our hybrid model with dif-ferent component techniques can signi cantly outperforms the basic retrieval model, which recon rms the e ectiveness of these techniques. In addition, when all these component techniques are used in our hybrid model, the retrieval per-formance can be further improved. It indicates that perfor-mance gains from these two component techniques can be added up in our proposed hybrid model. However, when we use a regression component to predict , the performance gain is not very obvious compared with other components. We conjecture the main reason is as follows: when the feed-back document set is more reliable for relevance feedback, the regression component is less useful.

When compared with the best TREC systems, our pro-posed model obviously outperforms the best TREC systems on most collections . It is of note that the results in our paper are obtained in a uniform setting across all collections while the best TREC results were from di erent participants inde-pendently. We believe the signi cant improvement is mainly from our successful integration of di erent IR techniques in the proposed model. In addition, according to Armstrong et al.'s survey, very few published results are better than the best TREC systems, mostly below medium systems. Our proposed model is promising, which provides a good avenue for future IR research, especially for evaluating the overall performance of a system (not a particular component of a system).
In this paper, we propose a hybrid model which can suc-cessfully integrate three e ective techniques in a uniform model. Extensive experiments show that our approach ob-viously outperforms the best TREC systems in most cases. In the future, we will investigate more e ective techniques in IR and incorporate them into our framework to conduct this research in details.
