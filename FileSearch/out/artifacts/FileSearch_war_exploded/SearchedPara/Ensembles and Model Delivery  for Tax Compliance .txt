 Revenue authorities characteristically have large st ores of historic audit da ta, with outcomes, ready for analysis. The Australian Taxation Office estab lished one of the largest data mining teams in Australia in 2004 as a foundation to becoming a knowledge-based organization. Today, every tax return lodged in Australia is risk assessed by one or more models developed through data mining, generally based on historic data. We observe th at any of the traditi onal modeling approaches, particularly including random forest s, generally deliver similar models in terms of accuracy. We take advantage of combining different model types and modeling approaches for risk scoring, and in particular report on recent research that incr eases the diversity of trees that make up a random forest. We also review, in a practical context, how such models are evaluated and delivered. Author Keywords: Ensemble Models, Random Forests, Risk Scoring, Model Evaluation. Dr. Graham Williams is Director of Data Mining at the Australian Taxati on Office, and previously Principal Computer Scientist for Data Mining with CSIRO. He is a Senior International Expert and Visiting Professor of the Chinese Academy of Scie nces at the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technologies, and Adjunct Professo r in Data Mining, Fraud Prevention, Security, at the University of Canberra and Australian National University. Graham is an active machine learning researcher and regularly teaches data mining courses. He is author of the freely available Rattle software for data mining and of the Rattle book published by Sp ringer in 2011: Data Mining with Rattle and R: The Art of Excavating Knowledge from Data. Grah am has been involved in data mining projects for clients from government and industry for over 25 years. His research developments include ensemble learning (1988) and hot spots discovery (1997). He is involved in numerous international artificial intelligence and data mining research activities and conferences and has edited a number of books and has authored many academic and indus try papers. He is chai r of the Pacific Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mi ning (PAKDD), and the Australasian Conference on Data Mining (AusDM). His passion is in ensuring data mining technolog y is readily accessible and available to all who wish, supporting innova tion and the sharing of our knowledge widely.
