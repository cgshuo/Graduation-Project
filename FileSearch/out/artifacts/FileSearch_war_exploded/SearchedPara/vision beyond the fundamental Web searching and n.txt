 vision beyond the fundamental Web searching and navigation issues. One might appreciate and understand better the significance of Web development in the coming decades after reading this last section of the book.
This book has provided an excellent account of the main issues of the scope of searching and navigating over the Web. It is possible to learn from this book how Web size, page content, link structures and user pref-erences impact on the design and development of search engines and navigation tools. It is also possible to learn how the dynamic nature of the Web has posed serious challenges to search engines, which aim to cover as large a portion of the Web as possible. Finally, the reader gains understanding on why search engines should have scalable architectures, intelligent scheduling strategies, efficient update algorithms for ranking metrics, personalized Web searching technologies, and so on.

Although the book covers and analyses the topic well, it does not address in sufficient depth the challenging problem concerning the ability for a search engine to understand the structure and semantics of XML data, which is recognized to be a key feature for next-generation engines. The author presents only a brief discussion of this topic in Chapter 10. Regarding various personalization categories for tackling the diversified user inter-ests, existing personalized search techniques mostly assume that the user X  X  interests are persistent. It is thereby feasible to learn a user X  X  current interests from a search history as discussed in Chapter 6. However, user inter-ests often change. The problem of how to model a user X  X  changing interests over time is still a challenge as well as an opportunity for future developments. In addition, the problem of how to make more sophisticated and personalizable ranking functions is an interesting area deserving future study.

To sum up, the book is well written and most of the chapters should be comprehensible to those with or without strong IT backgrounds. The book also provides extensive materials related to Web search engines and navigation, including references and Web sources. The book X  X  organization is highly reader-friendly, since all the chapters are accompanied by a large number of illustrations and examples. Each chapter includes ade-quate pointers such as a listing of objectives at the very beginning and an excellent summary at the end. The questions and exercises make the book a suitable as a textbook for undergraduates or postgraduates. The Skeptical Business Searcher: The Information Advisors Guide to Evaluating Web, Data, Sites and Sources, Berkman, R. Medford: Information Today, Inc., 281 pp., ISBN: 0-910965-66-8, $29.95
The Internet has become a valuable source of business information. However, the variation in the quality of the business information found on the Internet complicates the business information research process. Busi-ness information searchers need to be critical about what they get from the Internet, at the same time taking advantage of the flexibility of its tools to get the most out of the freely available information. They need to develop appropriate cultures, behaviours, qualities and skills to handle business information resources which they get, especially from the free Web resources.
 This book,  X  X  X he Skeptical Business Searcher: The Information Advisors Guide to Evaluating Web, Data, Sites and Sources X  X  by Berkman (2004) is useful in several ways, most importantly after reading it, one should  X  have an appreciation of the need to always check and re-check, verify and confirm free Web-based infor-mation before using it;  X  understand the various information resources that exist on the free Web that have been checked for quality and have been found to be useful in various situations;  X  apply different criteria to evaluate the quality and usefulness of free Web-based information;  X  not forget that non Web-based information can be very useful and whenever possible should be given preference;  X  be always sceptical and taking a critical stance towards any information that is obtained from the free Web.
The book consists of nine chapters plus two appendices and has 281 pages. The first chapter provides background information of the challenges that are faced by business information researchers in general, with a consideration of the changes brought in by the development of Internet technologies. The chapter concludes with a section on the scope of the book and how the book ought to be used. Chapter 2 provides some basic information on how a business information researcher should prepare himself or herself before using a search engine to search for business information. Chapter 3 describes the motivation to using Google search engine, and it also gives the reader a synopsis of how the search engine works, leading to Chapter 4 which provides the reader with techniques for handling questionable sites from the Internet. Chapters 5 X 7 discuss various free
Web-based information sources and tools, highlighting their strengths, weakness and how a business informa-tion searcher can benefit from using them. Chapter 8 describes how knowledge, intuition and trust can be pos-itively used to benefit a business information searcher. Chapter 9 provides a long list of business sites that have been screened and found to be credible. Some other sites that relate to topics covered in the various chapters are found in Appendix B. Appendix A describes a Website evaluation checklist.

The book is based on the practical experience of the author as a business information searcher and an edi-tor. The author revisits the issue of information quality to provide insights on how it relates to the Web. The book gives the reader a clear and vivid picture of how quality issues continue to be extremely important to those who are researching business information from the Web. An interesting aspect in this book is the way the author uses concrete examples as evidence to support the claims made about getting quality informa-tion from the free Web. These examples do not only validate the claims, but gives the reader an opportunity to try some searches to experience business research for themselves. I found the approach to be very useful.
After reading this book, one does not only come up with a theory of business research, but with practical examples that he or she could use in real life situation. For instance, Chapter 9 and Appendix B provide a list of several sites that were tried in different situations and found to be credible. Such a list, which is based on the practical experience of the author, is very useful. I have, during my reading of this book tried the examples and found them to be helpful. The inclusion of such lists makes the book not only enjoyable to the reader, but also acts as a reference source to help a business searcher who may not be having the time or even the requisite skill to screen Web resources.

Chapter 4 is very critical and enlightening. Whilst it sheds light on the appropriate skills required by business researchers, it also highlights the importance of multiple skills required for one to effectively perform a business information research. As matter of fact, the scepticism beheld by journalists when they search for information should form the basis for business information research. An important lesson from this chapter is the need to take information on the Web as just providing a lead until enough evidence has been accumulated to confirm the findings. Again, the strength of the discussion of this chapter is the way the author uses empirical evidence to buttress the claims that are made. The data providing the supporting evidence was collected from experienced
Web users. I like the blending of experience, theory and interview data, as it leaves the reader with concrete and practical examples of techniques for doing business information research using the Web.

Another point to note in this book relates to the way the author provides or recommends some references that help the reader to explore some important subjects which are not fully covered in the book, but deemed critical to enhancing business information research. Again, the way the author uses cross-references within the text makes reading easy (see page 140 cross referenced with Chapter 4).

Chapter 7 provides the reader with some mechanisms for establishing the veracity of information. An important contribution of this book is how the author careful raises an awareness of the reader to issues that might contaminate information, especially when dealing with the free Web-based information.

Today, we find that the Web-based resources have become the most widely used resources in business infor-mation research. Business information researchers tend to forget about other valuable resources which might be used instead. Important lessons to be learned from reading this book (Chapter 7 in particular) are that, before a business information searcher can make use of Web resources there is a need to ensure that there are no other better ways in which the information could be obtained. It should only be after finding no alter-natives that the searcher should consider using the free Web resources. This book provides several tips on important aspects to establishing or ensuring when a business researcher could benefit from using the Web. Also, the competencies that should by demonstrated by a searcher who intends to use a wide range of re-sources are given as examples. Furthermore, Chapter 7 introduces the reader to various techniques of verifying the quality of information sources, as additional criteria to the checklist given in Appendix A on Website eval-uation. Pitfalls that need to be avoided are also enlisted.

Chapter 8, although more theoretical when compared to the rest of the chapters in the book provides the reader with some important qualities that we normally take as given and therefore fail to consciously exploit their potential contribution in our pursuit for quality information from the free Web. Knowledge, intuition and trust are considered to be extremely important attributes of humans that business information searchers should learn to develop so that they can work to their advantage. And, not forgetting the wisdom, which is an important quality for finding solutions to problems.

While this book has an orientation towards a business information searcher, it will be helpful to any infor-mation searcher who is interested in quality information from the Web. For instance, Chapter 4 brings an interesting angle to the discussion by devoting some space to investigative journalism (see pages 100 and 101). Within this perspective the author provides interesting mechanisms which could help a business infor-mation researcher to confirm as well as verify information.

Before concluding this review, I want to highlight some areas that need improvement. I find the figures in-cluded in the text to be too many, with a number of them just referred to with little description provided. A detailed description with a URL address given could have been enough for many of the figures given. For instance, when a reader is referred to a figure, he or she expects to learn more about the subject under discussion, but gets disappointed when he or she finds himself or herself stuck with just a picture he or she cannot make much sense out of. See as example, Figure 2.6 and the comment about it on page 30. On a few occasions, the author tends to unnecessarily repeat what has been discussed before, see pages 76 and 77. Page 187, line 10 from the bottom, there is typo, the text should have read  X  X  ... information seekers refine ...  X  X  instead of  X  X  ... information refine seekers ...  X  X .

In conclusion, apart form the minor negative cases pointed above, the book is informative and well organ-ised. I enjoyed reading the book and recommend it for any reader interested in understanding and using the free Web for business information. For educators who teach business information resources like myself, I re-commend that you keep a copy in the library (especially the reserve collection for business information courses) to allow students of business information to read as well use as a reference source. For business infor-mation providers, there is a lot to learn from the book, as it gives a practical experience of how to use the free Web-based information resources. The book can be used as a valuable quick reference source for locating information from the free Web.
