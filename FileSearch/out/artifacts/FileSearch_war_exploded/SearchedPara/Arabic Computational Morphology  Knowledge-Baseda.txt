The past few decades have witnessed an increased interest in Arabic natural language processing, and in particular computational morphology. In the early 1990s one had to contend with a number of papers that proposed methodologies to handle the various complexitiesofArabicmorphology,mostofwhichhadlittleimplementationassociated with them, with the sole notable exception of the works of Beesley, Buckwalter, and others. 1 Today the field has grown, and as this book illustrates, more approaches and implementationsareemerging.
 history of Arabic computational morphology. The main body of the book is arranged in four parts. Part I (Chapters 1 X 3) consists of three introductory chapters. Parts II (Chapters4 X 7)andIII(Chapters8 X 11)presentvariousknowledge-basedandempirical approaches, respectively. Finally, Part IV (Chapters 12 X 15) demonstrates how Arabic morphology is integrated in larger applications, namely, information retrieval (IR), and machine translation (MT). A three-page index lists some grammatical terms and systemnames. 1. Part I: Introduction
The first introductory chapter, by the editors, gives an outline of the book, briefly explaining the various theoretical frameworks on which the rest of the chapters are based. As the book does not contain a chapter on root-and-pattern morphology, the authorsdiscussthisapproachinmoredetail.

The chapter covers orthography (with a detailed account of the history of
Arabic encoding systems), orthographic variations, tokenization, lexical design, and dialecticalissues. 2. Part II: Knowledge-Based Methods
This part of the book presents four knowledge-based methods for handling morphol-ogy:syllable-based,inheritance-based,lexeme-based,andstem-based.
 morphology X ) describes the Arabic tri-literal verbal system using the DATR formal-is m( www.datr.com ).

 proach to Arabic verbal root-and-pattern morphology X ) demonstrates that the Arabic verbal system (both tri-and quadriliteral forms) exhibits a number of generalizations, dependencies, and syncretisms. He demonstrates how these three features can be im-plemented in DATR. The generalizations are implemented through direct inheritance by placing forms that are more general in higher nodes in the network hierarchy. De-pendenciesareimplementedinasimilarfashionwheredependentsareplacedlowerin thehierarchyandmayrequiremultipleinheritancerules.Syncretismsareimplemented by DATR inference rules. As with the previous chapter, the approach does not require any mechanisms additional to what already exists. In both cases, it remains to be seen whetheracompletesystemcanbecoveredinDATR,whatthecomputationalandspace complexities would be, and how they would differ from the complexities of earlier finite-stateapproaches.
 trade-off between multiple operations and multiple stems X ) implements Arabic verbal and nominal forms (including the problematic issue of the broken plural) using the
Lisp-based MORPH  X  E system. The system is driven by a morphological form hierarchy that X  X escribestherelationshipofallmorphologicalformstoeachother, X  X ndtransfor-mationalrulesthatattachtoleafnodesinthehierarchy.

Without reading the abstract, the reader will wonder what the objective of the chapter is until the very end. In the words of the volume editors, the chapter X  X rovidesanin-depthdiscussionoftheroleofgrammar X  X exisrelations...After presenting the limits of [previous systems], the authors argue that entries associated with a finite set of morphosyntactic w-specifiers can guarantee a complete coverage of thedatawithintheboundariesoftheword-form X (p.8). 3. Part III: Empirical Methods The first chapter,  X  X earning to identify Semitic roots, X  by Ezra Daya, Dan Roth, and
Shuly Wintner, embarks on resolving a difficult task, the recognition of roots from 460 surface forms using a statistical machine-learning approach. The authors begin with a Hebrew syste mand extend it to handle Arabic. They report a precision of over 80%, whichtheycomparetotheaveragehumanperformanceforthesametask.

Mona Diab, Kadri Hacioglu, and Daniel Jurafsky, demonstrates how Arabic texts can be processed in terms of tokenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and base phrase chunking. To achieve this, the authors employ a support-vector-machine learn-ing approach, and extend its traditional use to tokenization. The accuracy results they reportrangefrom91.6%forbase-phrasechunkingto99.1%forclitictokenization. ogy, X  by Alexander Clark, experiments with learning the Arabic broken plural using a general-purposelearningalgorithm.Thealgorithmmakesuseofnon-deterministicsto-chastic finite-state transducers that perfor mtransductions between two surface for ms, inflectedandnon-inflected.
 speechtaggingofArabic, X  X yAntalvandenBosch,ErwinMarsi,andAbdelhadiSoudi, describes a memory-based learning technique for morphological analysis and part-of-speech tagging. They report a joint accuracy for both tasks of 58.1%. They conclude that although memory-based approaches are feasible for morphological analysis, they are unable to recognize the stems of unknown words. They note that the approach, however,workswellforpart-of-speechtagging. 4. Part IV: Integration in Larger Applications ThelastpartofthebookconsistsoftwochaptersonIRandtwochaptersonMT.
