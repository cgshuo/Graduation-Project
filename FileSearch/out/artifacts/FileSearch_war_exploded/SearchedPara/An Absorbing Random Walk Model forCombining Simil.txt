 With the advent of the internet era and the emergence of Big Data, users suffer from information overload painfully. Recommendation systems have been filled in people X  X  social life, users are offered a variety of personalized recommendations in social network. Therefore, How to find out effective methods to deal with information overload issue has become a very hot research .
 tion list. Over the years, researchers have done many works both in the industry and academia in order to develop new ways to make Top-K recommendation systems more consummation. All of these methods are mainly divided into three categories: neighborhood-based collaborative filtering, model-based collabora-tive filtering and the hybrid approaches [1]. The neighborhood-based approaches consider the similarities among users-items to do recommendations. The model-based approaches build a model at first, then train to explain the user-item purchase pattern. And the hybrid approaches combine results from different rec-ommendation approaches in order to provide better recommendations.
 recommendation for the user. In fact, recommendation system is just a kind of link prediction issue. As we know, link prediction problem based on node similarity has attracted many researchers. L  X  u [2] concluded some algorithms, which have been widely applied in link prediction, then found out an effective algorithm: random walk.It has been widely used in many application for a long time, and has been proved to do a good work. L  X  u put forward a link prediction approach based on local random walk, which proved that the proposed approach can do a better forecast and it has a lower computational complexity at the same time. Don et al. [3] researched on the design and analysis of some randomized on-line algorithms, then found out the problem was closely related to the synthesis of random walks while on the graphs with positive real costs on their edges. Zhao et al. [4] proposed a TWU graph and they did a Random Walk on the whole graph, so that they can measure the relevance between different terms, and finally combine them into the collective viewpoints. Lars et al. [5] combined the information of the network structure with nodes and edges level attribute naturally and then proposed a novel algorithm based on Supervised Random Walks. Yang et al. [6] studied a trapping problem occurring on both unweighted and weighted networks which may help to improve the design of system with efficient trapping process. It offers a new insight for us to control the trapping in complex systems.
 enhance the performance of recommender systems well? In this paper, we aim to design biased methods based on absorbing random walk to recommend the products for the users in social networks. We propose an UI graph to construct the relevance between users and items, which simultaneously incorporates item information and user structure. When construct UI graph, we consider two biased methods of the users.The one is based on the topology feature, and the other one is based on potential semantic feature. As well as the user X  X  tag items with content, we use a Topic Model to extract features of the users, then calculate the relevance based on the features. After these, we apply absorbing random walking on the UI graph and measure the relevance between users and items. Compared with the current baselines ,the result suggested that our approach is more effective.
 the related work, especially random walk based approaches. The related problem definition is proposed in Section 3. And we introduce our main algorithm in Section 4. Section 5 is the experimental evaluation and discussions. Finally we conclude our work in Section 6. Random walk has been applied on the recommendation problem by many re-searchers. Toine et al. [7] presented a recommendation algorithm and it can be easily to gain context information of different types, which is called ContextWalk. According to the method, the browsing process of a user on a movie database website can be modeled by taking random walks on the contextual graph. Jamali et al. [8] developed a model based on random walk which combining the trust-based and the collaborative filtering approach to make recommendation.they can define and measure the confidence of a recommendation,which is inspired by Markovian random walk. Shang et al. [9] developed a hybrid collaborative filtering model which can solve the data sparsity and cold start problems in rec-ommendation systems. More specifically, they build a directed graph which is consisted of both item nodes and user nodes,and includes item content, user pro-file and social network information as well. The model can provide personalized recommendations and predictions to individuals and groups. Zhang et al. [10] developed an algorithm based on random walk to address the sparsity problem in social tagging data. The potential transitive relations between users and items can be captured through their interaction with tags. Zhang et al.[11] considered user X  X  preference on item categories, then develop a recommendation algorithm. They classify the items into different categories and then compute the rank s-cores for each item, so that they can make a better recommendation based on both user X  X  previous interaction and item contents. Gori et al. [12] developed a randomCwalk based scoring algorithm named ItemRank, which can recommend topCrank items to potentially interested users through ranking products based on user preferences. Zhang et al. [13] applied a Gaussian random field and model the top-N recommendation task as a semi-supervised learning problem, consider-ing the degree of each node on the user-item bipartite graph, and use an effective absorbing random walk (ARW) algorithm for the task. Li et al. [14] proposed a graph-based recommendation algorithm using the relationship of users and adopt the Random Walk with Restarts to generate the recommendation users and evaluate the performance over precision-recall graph. Cheng et al. [15] pre-sented a recommendation algorithm that performs a query dependent random walk on a k-partite graph which builds based on the diverse features relevant to the recommendation task. Singh et al. [16] proposed an algorithm to filter the explicit used social relationships to find out users X  interesting on the items. They model a bipartite graph to present the relations of user-item and the social relations among users, then they propose an absorbing random walk for all the users walking over all items based on a set of stationary distributions. Zhu et al. [17] proposed a two-step utility query recommendation method based on ab-sorbing random walk, which can infer query utility by simultaneously modeling both users reformulation behaviors and click behaviors. Mavroforakis et al. [18] proposed a k absorbing random walk centrality which is beneficial to place the k absorbing nodes in different parts of the graph. We give a set of users and items, the ownership can be represented as a graph G = ( V; E ), which includes user nodes and item nodes and the relationship among users and items. we show the UI bipartite graph in Figure 1. Then we have the following definition: G = ( U; I; O; S ), where where O denotes that the user owns the item, and S denotes the social links between users. For convenience, we transform the equation as which can denote the users own the items and the social links between users respectively. Then we give the adjacency matrix of the bipartite graph as follows: where each block of the matrix corresponds the social links and the ownership. Because M is a adjacency matrix which is symmetric,so we give M T O to make our matrix to meet this requirement. The basic idea of the recommendation based on traditional random walk is to predict user X  X  preference using the expressed correlation graph which reveals the relationships between items. Absorbing Random Walks is a novel method which expanded on traditional random walk. Differently, there are absorbing states which once reached the random walk stop. It is a special Markov chain. The walker start from one user and walk on the graph based on a transfer probability matrix. If u already has the rating on target item i, then we stop our random walk and return r u;i as the result of random walk. If u does not have a rating on i, then we have two options: with probability , we dont continue the random walk. With probability 1-, we continue our random walk and walk to another user u X  who is one of us direct trusted neighbors. Generally, the walker chooses to transfer to a friend or an item uniformly. As the items are absorbing states, the walker can not leave an item once reaches. Formally, the transfer probability is given like this: Thus the transfer matrix can be represented as It can be seen that social links denote similarity interests, which is not always true in real, So we need to bias the random walk. In this paper, we user two method to do the bias. 4.1 Topology Biased As we know the similarity between users can be describe in variety ways, we consider the common neighbours of the users. In fact, it is a topology attribute. It is obvious that the more common neighbours the users have, the more similar they are. Thus we use the topology attribute to do the bias. Of course, the probability is still the same, then the transfer probability between users is replaced by
P ( u  X  j u ) = where N ( u ) is the a set of neighbours of u, and is a free parameter that reflects the preference for transfer to a friend who owns the same neighbours. when = 0, it is the unbiased random walk. 4.2 Latent Attributes Biased In latent semantic-based recommendation, the similarity of items can be com-puted using their features. In the social network, users may tag items with text information, and the text information may reflect some interest of the users. Con-sidering this, some potential attributes from the text information can be mined. As we know, LDA is effective on processing text information and can mine the potential semantic attribute of the text information. Imagine all the contents information belong to T topic, and user X  X  preference on the T topic indicating the users X  interest preference. Thus we can use the users X  interest preference do the bias. So we use LDA for modeling the potential interests of the users. tioned on the topic z n . From this, we can get T topic for each user and we regard the topics as the user X  X  potential interests.Then we calculate the transfer probability by
P ( u  X  j u ) = where T ( u ) is the vector of users X  T topic, and pcc is the Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
 out if they can reach a better performance . As we mentioned before, we use the similarity of the user nodes to calculate the transfer probability between users. Then we guess how can it perform if we calculate the transfer probability with the two different similarities. So we use a method to integrate the contribution value of the two similarities. Assume the two similarities be express as sim 1 and sim 2, thus the new similarity Sim can be calculate as The new method is called MIX-ARW. 5.1 Datasets In this paper, we chose three datasets to do the experiments to evaluate our methods:last.fm which from a music review site, citeULike which from a pa-per citation web and delicious which from a picture review site. Table 1 shows the detailed information of the three datasets. From the table, we can see the datasets are the social network with tag attributes, users can tag items with text information. So we can mine the potential semantic attributes from the tags in our experiments. The friendships are the total relationship between the users and the ownerships are the relationship between the users and items in the whole social networks. As we can see, the users nodes in the citeULike dataset have the closest relationship, the structure of the last.fm dataset is much more uniform, and the delicious dataset is more sparse the the other two datasets. 5.2 Evaluation Metric As the problem is the recommendation system, assume we make recommenda-tion list including k items to all the user nodes, and the average accuracy and recall of the recommendation can be used to measure the performance of the recommendation system. So the recall of the top K recommendation items in the recommendation list can be express as where L i is the recommendation list of the user u i , R i is the real set of items that u interested in. L i ( k ) \ R i means the number of the items in the recommendation list which u i interested in. The performance of the methods in the experiments is evaluated by this metric. 5.3 Results and Discussion In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we compare the proposed methods with CF and the traditional random walks with top k recom-mendation. As we can see, the parameters in our methods are much important, how to set a better value to the parameters is a significant problem. Thus, we try to set the parameters , and b better so that we can obtain the best results. In our experiments, we finally set = 10 and b=0.4 after we have tried variety value, because its best performance. Figure 3,4,5 show the compared results. better job on all the three datasets, especially on the citeULike dataset. Morever, we can see that the LA-AWR performs better than TB-AWR form the Fig 3, which is opposite in the Fig 5. Interestingly they have the same performance in the Fig 4. We think the bias can help to find out the deep relationship between the users and items. As we know, the most important in the random walks is the transfer matrix which can reflect the relationship of the nodes in the graph, and the transfer probability decides the walk of the nodes in the graph. Thus, our bias method can build the transfer probability matrix more accuracy so that the nodes can walk better to the destination nodes. culate the average value of the results. The final compare results of the three biased methods are showed in Figure 6,7,8.
 different datasets. LA-ARW perform better that other two methods on last.fm while TB-ARW perform best on citeULike, and the three methods almost reach a equal level in delicious. Although the MIX-ARW does not reach a best perfor-mance as we predicted, it is the middle value between the other two methods. Thus we can guess the obvious attribute and the potential attribute both make contribution in the recommendation system. And when the feature of the dataset is different, the influence is different. The citeULile dataset has the closest re-lationship between user nodes, the the topology based methods TB-ARW reach the best performance. The last.fm dataset has less friendships but the ownerships are more uniform, and the tag information is more complete to the users, so the potential semantic based method LA-ARW performs best. The delicious dataset has the most sparse structure, and the three method perform proximately. In this paper, we propose two methods to biased the Absorbing Random Walk. The experiments on three datasets show the proposed methods are much more effective on recommendation. More over, we explore the contribution of the two biased methods, and find out the truth that the contribution of the attributes is based on the feature of the dataset. In the future, we may add some more biased information on recommendation task, and the scalability of the algorithm is also a research direction.
