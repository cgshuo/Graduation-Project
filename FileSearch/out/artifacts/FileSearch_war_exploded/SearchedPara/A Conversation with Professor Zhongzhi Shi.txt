 Knowledge Discovery from Data (KDD) or Data Mining is a broad area that integrates techniques from several fields including volumes of data. There have been a large number of data mining algorithms rooted in these fields to perform different data analysis tasks. In China, we can divide KDD into 3 milestones: one that is related to machine learni ng algorithms, one for integrated knowledge discovery from datasets, and one for distributed and parallel KDD.  X  Machine Learning Algorithms The First Chinese Conference on Machine Learning was held in Huang -shan Mountain in 1987 and chaired by Professors Qingsheng Cai, Zhongzhi Shi and Shifu Chen. At that time, the Chinese researchers mainly focused on individual learning algorithms, such as inductive learning, analogical learning, case -based learning, explanation -based learning, genetic learning, and Learning X  X , published by International Academic Publishers in 1992, and written by Zhongzhi Shi, can reflect the progress of machine learning at that time.  X  Integrated Knowledge Discovery from Data In 19 89, Piatetsky -Shapiro and Fayyad presented the terminology  X  X nowledge Discovery from Databases X . In 1996, the book  X  X dvances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining X  was published, and another book  X  X sing the Data Warehouse X  was published in China in 1994 helped promote the KDD research in China. During that time, rough set, SVM, ensemble learning all became very hot research topics and a lot of papers on these topics were published. Special conferences were set up to dedicate to these areas. The book  X  X no wledge Discovery X  (First Edition) by Zhongzhi Shi, published by Tsinghua University Press in 2002 gave a summary of the above research areas.  X  Distributed and Parallel KDD Multi -agent system, semantic Web, Grid and Cloud Computing provide good platforms fo r KDD and data mining. Other Inte rnet related topics, including Internet of Things, video, image, TV, medicine data, all provide important resources for data mining. The book  X  X nowledge Discovery X  (Second edition), by Zhongzhi Shi, published by Tsinghua U niversity Press in 2011 gave a summary on the research of distributed and parallel KDD. I work in the Key Lab of Intelligent Information Processing, Institute of Computing Technology, the Chinese Aca demy of Sciences. Our lab specializes in the following research areas:  X  Attribute Theory in Learning System, 1990  X  Memory networks for representation of case -based reasoning.  X  A decision -tree learning algorithm based on bias shift, 1998  X  Bayesian network based latent semantic analysis algorithm  X  HyperSurface Classifier algorithms, 2002  X  Tolerance granular space model, 2005  X  Distributed data mining on agent grid, 2007  X  Feature binding model Bayesian Link Field Network, 2008  X  Formal definition of partition entropy and quasi -distance,  X  Fusing semantic aspects for image annotation and retrieval,  X  A parallel incremental extreme SVM classifier, 2011  X  Developed a two -phase cross -domain transfer learning  X  Data mining tools, such as MS Miner (2000),  X  Cloud computing platform based data mining tools: In my view, the following topics are important for the future development of KDD:  X  How to discover knowledge from cross -media datasets or  X  Research on parallel and distributed massive data mining  X  Statistic learning theory.  X  Transfer learning.
