 ratings for other items and a set of historical ratings for other users[4 ] . 
Association rule mining[2 ] is a powerful data mining method to search for user on the items similar to the target item. related works associated with our algorithm. In Section 3, we propose our algorithm. Then, we evaluate our algorithm on two publicly available datasets in Section 4, and show that our approach outperforms the Pearson method and adjusted cosine method. Finally, we conclude the paper and discuss further development. 2.1 Quantitative Association Rule bought together. Agrawal et al.[2 ] gave a formal description of the problem of mining rules whose support and confidence are greater than or equal to user-defined minimum support (minsup) and minimum confidence (minconf). Quantitative 2.2 Pearson Approach weighted average of deviations from the neighbor X  X  mean. a weighted sum of the ratings of the other users: 
Where,  X  is a normalizing factor such that the absolute values of the weights sum to unity. rating of the active user over all items he had rated. overlapping ratings, n is the number of neighbors. 2.3 Adjusted Cosine Approach j using adjusted cosine method is given by 
Here u R is the average of the user u  X  X  ratings. may utilize the relationships between items to alleviate the data sparseness problem in the neighborhood-based algorithms. We design a twofold approach based on the intuition. 3.1 Predict Using Quantitative Association Rules compactness of the rules mined. We apply quantitative association rule mining on the support and confidence associated with two items. We compute the confidences conf of the rule Rate(item i , where similarity associated with two items i and j . Then we compute the prediction on the described as follows. sized intervals. unrated item k is most likely lies in the interval So we set the prediction value with the midpoint of interval 0 c . 
Then we get a pseudo fully filled ratings matrix to be used in neighborhood-based pseudo fully filled ratings matrix. 3.2 Predict Using Neighborhood-Based Method With the pseudo fully filled ratings matrix, we can predict the ratings of unrated items using the neighborhood-based method. We use the Pearson algorithm here. The procedure of predicting ratings using the Pearson algorithm is described as follows: association rules method. similarities with him, n is the neighbors number. 3. Make predictions: Make prediction for an unrated item using Eq.(1). 
The algorithm overcomes the sparsity problem by utilizing the latent relationships preferences, has the advantages of both memory-based and model-based methods. sparseness problem in the neighborhood-based algorithms. For convenience, we denote the algorithm as QAR_Pear below. 4.1 Dataset We use two datasets, MovieLens[1 ] and Jester[3 ] to evaluate the presented approach. MovieLens is an existing movie recommendation system, the ratings are made on a 5-million continuous ratings (-10.00 to +10.00) of 100 jokes. We split each of the two and the test set is about 0.8:0.2. 4.2 Evaluation Metrics Characteristic curve (ROC) [4 ] to evaluate the accuracy of recommender system. The MAE E of a recommender system is evaluated by the equation: 
P and item entry respectively. The lower the MAE, the more accurately the recommendation the recommender system is. 4.3 Result and Discussion We have performed a number of experiments to compare the recommendation accuracy of the Pearson, adjusted cosine and QAR_Pear methods with the two form 5 to 100. the Pearson and adjusted cosine methods on the two datasets. 
From the experimental results of the two datasets, we can show that the proposed cosine algorithms. The proposed algorithm overcomes the sparsity problem by utilizing the latent with similar preferences, has the advantages of both memory-based and model-based improve scalability and alleviate the sparsity problem further.
