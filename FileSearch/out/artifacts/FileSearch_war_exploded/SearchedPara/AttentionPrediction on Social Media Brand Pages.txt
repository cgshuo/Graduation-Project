 In this paper, we deal with the problem of predicting how much attention a newly submitted post would receive from fellow community members of closed communities in social networking sites. Though the concept of attention is sub-jective, the number of comments received by a post serves as a very good indicator of the same. Unlike previous work which primarily made use of either content features or the network features (friendship links on the network), we ex-ploit both the content features and community level features (for instance, what time of the day is the community more active) for tackling this problem. Further, we focus on ded-icated pages of corporate brands on social media websites and accordingly extract important features from the content and community activity of such brand pages. The attention prediction task finds direct application in the listening, mon-itoring and engaging activities of the businesses that have such brand-pages. In this paper, we formulate the prob-lem of attention prediction on social media brand pages. We further propose Attention Prediction (AP) framework which integrates the various features that influence the at-tention received by a post using classification and regression based approaches. Experimental results on real world data extracted from some highly active brand pages on Facebook demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

The ever growing amount of user generated content and active participation over social media have recently attracted considerable public and scientific interest. A number of dif-ferent studies estimate that the time spent on social net-working websites is 20-25% of the total time spent on the internet. A significant portion of this social media usage is critial for businesses to listen, monitor and respond. There exist many forums, blogs, news-sites and message-boards where customers express their opinions, complaints, ques-tions, suggestions etc. regarding products and services.
Businesses are increasingly becoming aware of this trend and devising strategies to best make use of this social me-dia channel. It is now common to see  X  X ages X  of various businesses on commonly used social networking websites 1 . These pages are used by companies to make announcements and get feedback from customers about their products or services. Customers themselves use these brand pages for availing discounts, read reviews, access information, submit opinion etc. In some cases, companies (customers) are also using these pages for providing (accessing) customer service. Since the nature of brand page usage varies across  X  X uthors X  of user generated content, it is desirable for businesses to be able to prioritize the content for listening and responding. While the exact prioritization schema may depend on an application requirement, we focus on prioritizing the posts based on their popularity. Although this prediction may not entirely solve the problem of prioritization, it can serve as an important feature in the overall prioritization schema. Such prediction may be helpful for both the corporate brands as well as their customers. Companies can use this for targeted advertising, filtering, monitoring and prioritized responding while the customers can access relevant filtered content. Our main contributions through this paper are :
Predicting the popularity of newly submitted online con-tent has been of great interest to the research community
W e refer to such pages as brand pages through out this paper rec ently. Although popularity itself is a subjective concept, some of the standard metrics like the number of comments a particular item of content receives serve as indicators of the content X  X  popularity.

Several approaches have been proposed to deal with the problem of predicting the content popularity across diverse domains tackling various applications. Survival analysis frame-work was used in [3] to predict the overall number of com-ments by observing a thread for 2-3 days. This is based on the earlier finding by Szabo and Huberman [9] that corre-lates long time popularity of content with its early measured popularity. Lerman and Hogg [4] developed a stochastic model of user behavior that allowed prediction of popular-ity based on early user reaction to new content. Their model considers the complex interaction among content quality, web site design and influence among users. Their study uses the social dynamics of Digg website framework where dif-ferent users can vote for an article and change the way and location where it is presented on the website. It is argued in the paper that the inherent story  X  X uality X  or  X  X nteresting-ness X  cannot be directly measured from the data and should be estimated from the early reaction to the story. The ap-proaches described use early reaction of users to content in order to predict the content X  X  overall popularity. This may not be desirable in the brand-page analysis scenario pre-sented in this paper where the early reaction itself is the most important part for the businesses to make use of. The current study therefore utilizes factors which are available since the time the story is submitted.

Yano et al. [10] studied a related problem of predicting whether a user would comment on a given blog post. They proposed the usage of latent Drichlet association (LDA) probabilistic model [1] for generation of blog posts and com-ments jointly. They used the information from the previous posts that a user has commented on in order to predict fu-ture responses of the user. Although related to our work, it is not easy to apply this kind of approach to social me-dia brand pages, the reason being that it is impossible to check if each user would be interested in commenting on a particular post due to the sheer volume of the users in the community.

Several Twitter specific scientific studies have also stud-ied a related problem of predicting whether a tweet will be re-tweeted. Most of these studies [8, 5, 11] concluded that the social features (number of followers, friends, lists etc.) have the maximum effect on retweetability. A collaborative filtering approach was used in [11] to study the retweet be-haviour persistent among pairs of users. They used author information, number of the followers and number of words in the tweet for this study. A passive-aggressive algorithm was used in [5] to predict the retweetability. Although it was found in [5] that while the social features alone perform very well, there is substantial gain in also using content spe-cific features. These content specific features comprised of novelty, trending words, and other meta information of the tweet (whether the tweet is a reply to some other tweet etc.).
As discussed above, though most of the previous work tackled the problem of predicting the content popularity, it is not straightforward to apply these existing techniques in the context of social networking sites. Thus we propose an Attention Prediction framework for dealing with this prob-lem. This framework combines social and content specific features in order to facilitate the prediction of content pop-ularity in online social networking sites.
In this section, we first outline the problem definition and then describe in detail the approach we employ to solve the post popularity prediction problem in the context of social networking sites.
 Post Popularity Prediction Problem : Given a brand page B on a social networking site comprising of a set of posts P of cardinality N with the associated popularity mea-sure C , predict the popularity c N +1 of a new incoming post p Our Approach : We make use of a combination of content specific, temporal and author specific features that would enable better capture of the underlying patterns of the data, thus, facilitating better predictions.
 On obtaining all the features discussed above, we learn SVM based classification and regression models 2 .
In this section, we briefly discuss the experimentation that we carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our At-tention Prediction framework. In order to evaluate the task of popularity prediction, we consider the number of com-ments that a post receives as an indicator of popularity. So, we pose the task of attention prediction of a particular post as predicting the number of comments that a post would h ttp://svmlight.joachims.org/ Table 1: Details of the Dataset -Data Collected for one week ga rner in particular temporal and contextual environment. Further, we report the performance of our framework over -We also train the classification/regression mechanisms to evaluate how well they perform in predicting the attention for different time periods i.e how effective is our approach to answer questions like how much of attention is this post going to receive within the first hour of it being posted.
Datasets: In order to validate our approach, we collected the posts and comments from three different highly active brand pages on Facebook for a period of about one week. We collected a total of 35,809 posts and their associated comments. A detailed description of the dataset is given in Table 1. For all our experiments, we have used the last 25% of the posts on each brand page as the test set. The initial 75% of the set was used for training the models.

Baselines: To compare the performance of our approach with the state-of-the-art, we implemented an user-centric approach as proposed in [6] and [10]. For each user, we determine if the user would be interested in commenting on a given post or not, based upon the user X  X  topics of interest. These topics of interest are identified using Latent Dirichlet Allocation [1] for each user.
As explained above, we posed the problem at hand as a classification problem with 4 different classes each cor-responding to the number of comments -Very less atten-tion ( &lt; 10% of the maximum of comments garnered) Less attention ( &lt; 25% of the maximum of comments garnered), Mediocre attention ( &lt; 50% of the maximum of comments garnered), High Attention ( &lt; 75% of the maximum of com-ments garnered), Very High attention ( &gt; 75% of the maxi-mum of comments garnered).

Experimentation: After tagging the posts in the dataset with the appropriate classes (based on the number of com-ments received), we run the SVM classification training mod-ule using the initial 75% of the posts from each brand page as our training set. This aided us in learning the weights for each of the individual features corresponding to content, author and temporal activity. We tested the performance of our framework on the remaining 25% of the data for each brand page. We simulated the process of comments pour-ing in according to the time and appropriately updated the training set with the same every one hour. Also, we compare T able 2: Performance of Attention Prediction and Baseline -Classi cation T able 3: Performance of Attention Prediction and Baseline -Regression th e predictions of our approach in terms of the number of the comments received by each post in the test set at inter-vals of 1 hour, 3 hours, 8 hours, 1 day, 2 days. We present the results for the same in Table 2.

Discussion: As can be seen from Table 2, our attention prediction framework outperforms the baseline in predicting the popularity of the posts at different time intervals since the time they are first posted. Analysis of this kind of be-havior revealed that this problem of predicting the post pop-ularity cannot be tackled well using user centric techniques highlighted in [6] and [10]. These user centric techniques primarily make use of individual user interests in order to predict if the user is likely to comment on a post or not. However, more often than not, whether a particular user would comment on a post or not is governed not just by the topics of interest, but also by various other external issues like time the user logs in and checks his social networking profile, how active the user is in the current period of time etc. Bearing these issues in mind, dynamic behavior of users is not always predictive of the post popularity, hence our ex-periments also reveal the need for aggregate techniques as opposed to user specific ones for attention prediction.
In this subsection, we discuss the results of posing atten-tion prediction problem as a regression problem. We again present our results in terms of predicting the number of com-ments at different time intervals for each post.

Experimentation: We make use of support vector re-gression model for the training phase. As earlier, we make use of 75% of the data from each brand page for training and the remaining for testing. We use the predictive-R 2 statistic to evaluate the performance. We present the results for the same in Table 3.

Discussion: As can be seen, our framework outperforms the baseline even in this case of regression. As in the pre-vious case, the best performance is achieved in the case of both AP framework and the baseline when predicting the number of comments at the end of 2 days. During our anal-ysis, we found that the task of predicting comments a post will receive at initial time intervals is much more noisy com-pared to the stable state prediction of popularity for each post. The same is reflected in the results in Tables 2 and 3.
In this work, we have formulated the problem of predict-ing a post X  X  popularity on brand pages in social networking sites. We further presented a detailed analysis of the fea-tures that would aid us in doing the same. We posed this as classification and regression problem and tried to study the performance in terms of accurately predicting the number of comments a post would receive. Further, we have tried to keep our approach generic enough to be extended to most communities or discussion forums, however, on typical dis-cussion forums, user specific interests on commenting are likely to play a bigger role. An interesting direction to this work would be to gauge how a combination of user specific interests when coupled with the aggregate analysis would perform on the task of attention prediction on social media brand pages.
