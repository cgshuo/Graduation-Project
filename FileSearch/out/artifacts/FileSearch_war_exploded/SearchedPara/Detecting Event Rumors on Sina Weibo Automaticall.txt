Weibo is a kind of convenient sites for users to show themselves and communicate with others. It is put into service in 2009 by Sina Corporation. A recent official report shows that Sina Weibo has more than 300 million registered users by the end of Feb-ruary 29, 2012 and posts 100 million micro-blogs per day. Unfortunately, the wealth of information also attract interests of spammers who attempt to send kinds of spams sites. Some of these malicious spams may cause significant economic loss to our so-ciety and even threaten national security and harmony. more harmful than other kinds of spams especially in China. Event rumors are spams that make up untruthful social events and they X  X e harmful to society security and har-picture is not a scene of a movie or a war, but shows that an officer was on his way to 08:31 on May 11. 
To detect spams, Sina Weibo has tried several ways such as adding a "report as a spam" button to each micro-blog as shown in the left bottom of Figure 1. Any users considering a micro-blog to be suspicious can report it to Sina official Weibo account (with the translated English user name of  X  X eibo Rumor-Busting X  [1]) who specia-Figure 1 is a rumor and gives detailed and authentic reasons. Though artificial method is accurate, it costs a lot of human efforts and financial resources. What's more, there is a certain delay by this approach. It can not identify a spam quickly once it appears. The rumor may have been spread widely and produced bad effects on society before it is identified manually. So an automatic appr oach to detecting event rumors is essen-tial. To the best of our knowledge, [1] is the first paper that detect rumor automatical-accuracy has big room to be improved. cause it is more harmful to our society than others. We consider the problem of rumor posts, we design special features about even t rumors from Sina Weibo and build clas-sifiers based on these features. Then we divide event rumors into 4 types and propose cate that our approaches are effective. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we give a review of re-lated work. In section 3 we describe our two approaches to identifying event rumors and provide a detailed description of the new features. In section 4 we describe how to collect data and present the experimental results. Finally, we conclude this paper in section 5. The previous research about spam detection mainly focuses on detecting spams re-into two types. One is detecting spammers who publish social spams [5-10], while the other is detecting spams directly [1-4]. 
Lee et al. [6] proposed a honeypot-based approach to uncover social spammers in online social systems including MySpace and Twitter. They deployed social honey-Then they analyzed the properties of these spam profiles and built spam classifiers to attributes about user behavior and built a SVM classifier to detect spammers of Twit-ads, especially link deception. Stringhini et al. [7] did detailed analysis of spammer on Whisperer. Random forest algorithm was used to identify spammers. 
Wang [3] extracted three graph-based features and three content-based features, work, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbor. Finally they found that Bayes classifier is best well-performed. The three graph-based features were extracted from Twitter X  X  social network graph which represents the following relationship among users. The content-based features contained the number of duplicate tweets, the num-ber of HTTP links, and the number of replies or mentions. Similar to this work [3], in Wang X  X  another work [4], a new content-based feature named trending topics works, Yang, et al. [1] extracted two new features, client-based feature and location-micro-blog while the later refers to the actual place where the event mentioned in the micro-blog has happened. They trained a Support Vector Machine classifier to meas-point is that the dataset they used is from Sina Weibo. To the best of our knowledge, tween this work and ours lies in that we focus on event rumors. Gao, et al. [2] studied group and then identified spam clusters. The difference from previous works is using clustering method. 
As mentioned above, majority of the previous works are about detecting spams focus on identifying event rumors (rumors about social events), which are more harm-China. 3.1 Problem Statement previous works focus on detecting spams like ads and pornography as mentioned above. other kinds of spams in China. Other rumors like gossips about stars are not covered by event is described by attributes such as time, location, character and content. 
In the following we list the notations to be used in the subsequent sections.  X   X  X  X  X  X   X   X  : set of users  X   X  X   X   X   X   X  : set of micro-blogs  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X  X   X   X |  X   X   X  X  X   X  X   X   X   X  X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  : a set of  X   X   X  X  followers  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X  X  X  X  X   X   X  |  X   X   X  X  X   X  X   X   X   X  X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  : a set of  X   X   X  X  friends  X   X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X . : the posting time of micro-blog  X   X   X   X   X   X  X  X  X . : the text content of micro-blog  X   X   X   X   X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X . : the picture attached to micro-blog  X   X  3.2 Detecting Event Rumors In this paper, we consider event rumors detection as a classification problem. To iden-tify the event rumors on Sina Weibo automatically, we need to train classifiers and the user-based features and multimedia-based features . Some of these features have been introduce them briefly. Content-Based Features. Content-based features are 8 attributes related to the mes-sage content including the number of comments, the number of retweets, the number latter two are new features proposed by us. The number of comments and the number of retweets. Event rumors are usually trend-ing topics that attract more comments and retweets than common micro-blogs. The number of  X  X  X  tags.  X  X  X  is considered as a mention tag in Sina Weibo similar blog messages as a reply or mention of another user. A user can mention anyone in a micro-blog as long as the user follows him or her. If a user is mentioned in a micro-spread rumors. Shorten URLs can hide the URLs X  source and users can X  X  get direct information from the URLs. So URL is an attribute that is often utilized by rumor publisher. Given two micro-blogs named  X   X  and  X   X  , we measure the similarity based on Jaccard coefficient as shown in Equation 1. are the words of the micro-blog text after removing stopping words. When the value of similarity is bigger than 0.8, we consider the two micro-blogs are duplicates. divided into two types [1]: non-mobile client and mobile client. The non-mobile client program includes Sina Weibo web-app, times posting tools and embedded Sina Wei-clients, they are often utilized to post and spread event rumors by users. blogs, we regard the number of event verbs as one of the features. We create an event news of Sina and Fenghuang. Second, we filter out the common verbs usually used in daily life. Figure 3 compares the number of event verbs in event rumor and non-rumor micro-blogs. In this figure, each point represents a micro-blog message. The message contains strong negative words or not. We find that most of event ru-mors are negative social events and contain strong negative sentiment words and opi-more likely to contain strong negative words than normal micro-bogs. User-Based Features.

If user X  X  identity is verified by Sina Weibo officially, then a VIP ters, organizations, famous corporations and so on. Usually, VIP users are less likely to post rumors. higher this value, the more likely the users post event rumors. Ratio of micro-blogs containing strong negative words. This attribute means the pro-portion of micro-blogs that contain strong negative words over all micro-blogs posted by the user. The higher this value, the more likely the users post event rumors. Multimedia-Based Features. Multimedia-based features are attributes about picture. audios. The most powerful feature we extracted from picture is time span. and were published before. We call them outdated pictures. Users utilize the outdated pictures and new messages to make up a new micro-blog related to event rumors. The timespan function is defined by Equation 3.  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X   X   X   X , X  X  X  X .  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X .  X   X  X  X  timespan threshold. In our experiment we set the threshold value as a week. 
The time of picture is calculated by the following steps. First, we use the picture-to-action function provided by Baidu 1 search engine which is used to identify similar pictures to find out the attached picture on the Internet. If we submit a picture shown in Figure 6 which is an attached picture of the rumor shown in Figure 1 as a query, the picture is bigger than the threshold, then the value is 1. Otherwise the value is 2. the distribution of timespan of micro-bogs that contain pictures. The two distributions indicate that rumors are more likely to cont ain an outdated picture than normal micro-blogs indeed. blog is an event rumor or not. 3.3 Detecting Text-Picture Unmatched Rumors detect text-picture unmatched rumors. 
Based on our observation, most event rumors belong to one of the following types:  X 
Complete fiction: The social event itself is a pure fabrication.  X  sages are out of date and become time-sensitive event rumors.  X  attributes: time, location, char acter and content. This kind of rumor is made up by proportion latter was true but is out of date while the former is fake.  X 
Text-picture unmatched rumors: As shown in Figure 1, to increase event rumors X  tween the picture and the text. From Figure 8 we can see that about 80% event rumors contain a picture and a major-instance of text-picture unmatched rumor, whose text describes an officer X  X  investiga-tion of people X  X  life under the protection of soldiers, but the picture actually describes bassy accompanied by security personnel in fact. The rumor account utilizes the unre-unmatched rumor. We propose a 5-step method to identify this kind of event rumors. 
First, we create a list, including 60 news websites consisting of almost all the major domestic media, and foreign media 2 . Second, we submit the picture attached to a mi-cro-blog as a query to search engine to look for similar pictures. If the output result is nothing, then we consider that the picture matches the text, and the micro-blog is non-and their posting time descending. The websites in the list created in the first step are credible and their credibility is the same while others are not credible. Third, we crawl moving stopping words. If they are similar, we consider the micro-blog is non-rumor. Otherwise, they are text-picture unmatched rumors. 4.1 Collection of Dataset labor. Besides, the result may not be accurate by the errors in human judgment. For-tunately, Sina Weibo has an official account named  X  X eibo Rumor-Busting X  for pub-by authoritative sources. Based on this official rumor busting service, we build a high quality dataset. 
The micro-blogs posted by  X  X eibo Rumor-Busting X  are messages explaining themselves, so we need to construct queries manually to find out the original rumors cro-blogs published by  X  X eibo Rumor-Busting X  from May 2011 to December 2011. authentication) of users who published the event rumors correspondingly and all their 1943 users and 26972 micro-blogs, which includes 104 event rumors and 26868 non-rumors. 4.2 Evaluation To assess the effectiveness of our methods, we use the standard information retrieval The recall is the ratio of the number of rumors correctly classified to the total number of true rumors. The F1 is the harmonic mean between both precision and recall, and is works [1, 3-5] including Na X ve Bayes, Bayesian Network, Neural Networks and Deci-features introduced in Section 3.2 on the classification performance. 0.202 and 0.269 respectively. There are two reasons why the performance of these old features in our experiment is worse than that in previous works. One is that the data-After introducing the 5 new features to the classification process, the precision, recall the precision, recall and f1-measure have increased 0.475, 0.048 and 0.276 separately, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed new features. picture unmatched event rumors and 23 non-rumors. All these micro-blog messages and the precision, recall and F-measure are 0.833, 0.823 and 0.857 respectively. The fects the experimental results to some extent. from normal messages, we propose five new features and use classification technique effective. In the future we will focus on study how to detect other three forms of event rumors. Acknowledgement.
