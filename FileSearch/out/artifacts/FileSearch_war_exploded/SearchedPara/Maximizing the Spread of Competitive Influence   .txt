 With the increasing popularity of online social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, spread of online social networks by focusing on influence maximization. Kempe et al. cascade model. The seminal work given by Kempe et al. [1] motivates various studies on influence maximization in social networks [2, 3, 4]. ing with one another, exactly the problem that we will solve in this paper. 
Motivated by the above scenarios, several recent studies have looked into competi-tive influence diffusion. Bharathi et al. [8] studied the game theory based competitive paigns under an extension of IC model. In these extensions of the IC model, the node only can be activated by one of in-neighbors, and the influence accumulation of acti-vated in-neighbors of a certain node has not been considered. (LT) model by incorporating the competitive influence spread and considering the nature of competitive influence spread, and the objective function is monotone and submodular which could approximate the optimal algorithm with 1 X 1/ e approximation ration. We define the ELTM as an extension of the LT model as follows. In G I denotes the B  X  X  seed set, and S A denotes the A  X  X  seed set ( S this paper, we define the influence degree of A as q A
For node v , we describe the above ELTM as the following four active cases. (a)The weight of A -activated in-neighbors of node v multiplies q than or equal to the A -activated threshold A V  X  node v can be written as 1 () 1 A t ap v + = and 1 () 0 (b) The weight of A -activated in-neighbors of node v multiplies q v multiplies q B , which is greater than or equal to the B -activated threshold B can be written as 1 () 0 A t ap v + = and 1 () 1 B t ap v  X  , then the bigger weight to v dominates. If they are equal, then the influence spread. Then, we obtain 1 () 1 + = A t ap v and q (or resp. q B ), which is less than the A -activated threshold threshold B v  X  ), then we have 11 () () 0 AB tt ap v ap v vated nodes by A is maximized. More precisely, let I B ( S  X  V \ I B ) denote the seed set of A . The problem of selecting the optimal seed set S size k is to maximize the influence of seed set of A , denoted as Selecting the optimal seed set of A is NP hard, while knowing the seed set of B . 
The objective function  X  ( S A , I B ) is monotone and submodular under the ELTM and  X  (  X  , I the greedy algorithm. influence weight of edges. 
In this experiment, we select 10 seeds with random algorithm as the initial seeds of B the greedy algorithm outperforms the max-degree algorithm and the random algorithm. 
We further compare the number of A -activated nodes of greedy algorithm with differ-ent influence degrees of A , which includes three cases: (a) q q been known. The objective function of selecting the optimal seed nodes is monotone with 1 X 1/ e .
