 Thanks to great efforts dedicated to Yellow Ri ver, its levees are neither breached nor its course changed since the last 60 years. The scenarios of Yellow River has really changed very much. Today the water volume of Yellow River drops remarkably and the catastrophic floods hardly take place if any. But its basic features never change: less water and more sediment, uneven time-space distribution of river runoff. So the problems with concerned Yellow River are not eradicated although they are strikingly eased. By contraries, some new issues appear due to the social and economic developments in the basin. For example, sharp contradiction between demand and zero-flow, etc. In order to cope with such all problems, a lot of efficient measures have been put into place, including water regulation over the whole basin, operations of sediment-water discharge regulation. Obviously, all measures taken to harness Yellow River and manage water resources in the basin are fundamentally based on hydrological information. 
Tremendous volume of hydrological information in the basin has been accumulated so far. But by contrast with increasingly demands posed to harness Yellow River, the hydrological information is not well organized and managed. For example, not all And some of them are still stored in paper medias and are at risk of being damaged, for example the raw observation data stored at LUHUN reservoir in the basin. In addition, all original measuring information is separately kept by different administrative units. Although some management systems have already been implemented to store annually processed hydrological information and survey information of river sections of the lower reach respectively, they are isolated and can not be used in the collaborative way. It is very hard for both researchers and publics to access hydrological information. Also, we know that lots of information is often needed at the same time to tackle a given specific problem. For example, all information such as evaporation, groundwater, precipitation etc is necessary for water resources planning. But it is very inconvenient to get them and in some cases even impossible to access them. Hence the way that hydrological information is organized does not suit to the current situation of harnessing Yellow River. 
Recently we have proposed a Web-based management system of hydrological information that aims at answering questions about information requirement. Its main ideas are to integrate heterogeneous hydrol ogical data into a common platform and provide comprehensive information services for various users. It will play important rules to keep healthy life of Yellow River and support sustainable developments of society and economics in the basin. It will also make hydrological information open and sharable resources accessed by publics. This paper describes main techniques used and introduces its key functionalities. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is about the related hydrological data; the framework of data integration and information services is discussed in Section 3; Section 4 presents key functionalities while implementation techniques are described in Section 5; and we conclude this paper in Section 6. Hydrological data record by scientific method can date back to 1900 when the first meteorological observation station in the Yellow River Basin was built. Today, different kinds of relatively perfected m easurement systems of hydrological and meteorological data have been completed or are under construction in the basin including its tributaries. They are charged by Yellow River resources conservancy commission and regional administrations respectively. According to 1, there are 451 hydrological stations, 62 stage stations, 2,357 rainfall stations, 169 evaporation stations, 61 sediment survey sections in Sanmenxia reservoir, 174 in Xiaolangdi reservoir, 152 in the low reach and 36 in river mouth of seashore region, etc. A satellite X  X ased observing system is being built in the original region of Yellow River to collect information of water resource at this region. In addition, 1276 observation well of groundwater level have also been built. They make up of principal data sources of hydrology and water resources information in the basin. The items that are measured and collected include precipitation, evaporation, water level, flow, sediment, water temperature, ice status, sediment section of river courses, density flow, underground water, etc. As indicated at the Section 1 and Section 2, there is large volume of hydrology and water resources information, and on the other hand it is very hard and even impossible to get needed information. Data integration can provide a solution to getting over difficulties of information need and access. The Figure 1 illustrates the framework of hydrological data integration and information services. It consists of several logical parts: data integration, enterprise data server, application server, Web server. 3.1 Data Integration The availability of integrated hydrological data and water resources information from different sources is crucial for flood management, water resources planning and other many tasks involved to harness Yellow River. Data integration is the first step toward making information open and sharable. The objective of data integration is to combine data from heterogeneous, distributed sources into homogeneous, compact data platform with resolving a variety of data conflicts. 
In the case of Yellow River, data to be integrated includes raw measuring data still in paper medias, real-time collected data, legacy data system, data from other measurement networks not under the control of Hydrology bureau of Y RCC (Yellow River Conservancy Commission), meteorological data from the regional and national meteorological systems, etc. Among other things for data integration, one of most challenging tasks is to transfer huge volume of raw measuring data into computer system from paper medias. Data of legacy systems can be extracted and processed by programming or by the help of some data integration tool. Meteorological information can be obtained from related public meteorological systems over the Internet. Hydrological data kept at the 6 br anch bureaus (located at Jinan, Zhengzhou, Sanmenxia, Yuci, Baotou and Lanzhou respectively) can be locally processed and then sent to the headquarter over Internet for example. By setting up certain agreement with local administrations in the basin at high level, data collected by measurement network not in the charge of YRCC may also be obtained. Once time that all related data is already, we can perform data cleaning and recoding and then integrate them into a global data schema, which is maintained in an enterprise data server. 3.2 Enterprise Data Server We organize integrated data into different basic categories, such as historical flood data, groundwater data, geographic information of various measurement stations, raw hydrological measurement data, historical data of typhoons that have impact on the Yellow River basin, hydrological analysis result data, etc. We take an advanced relational-object database management system as enterprise data server platform of data management, which must support data warehouse and OLAP techniques and can also manager both spatial and multimedia data. The data of the basic categories make up of professional bases and basic bases, represented by professional DB and basics DB in Fig. 1 respectively. 
Data contained in professional DB base and basic DB base within the enterprise data server are stored and managed in the way that traditional transaction data is managed. They are aimed at efficiently supporting simple information query and ordinary statistical calculus. But in order to cope with topics-oriented complex information query and analysis, enterprise data warehouse (DW) must be built with the help of ETL (Extract, Transform and Load)2 techniques from the professional DB base and basic DB base. ETL is the set of processes by which data is extracted from numerous databases, applications and systems, transformed as appropriate, and loaded into target systems -including, but not limited to, data warehouses, data marts, analytical applications, etc. 
The topics contained in the data warehouse are oriented to many fields related to harnessing Yellow River, such as flood management, water resources management, etc. Enterprise DW supports advanced expl etory analysis of hydrological information while the metadata stores description information of how to locate and use data contained in the DW and so on. 3.3 Application Server All business logic components needed to realize information services are located within the application server. Each of the components corresponds to specific business functionality. They are independent of each other and can also call each other. The application server works as container that provides running environment for the business logic components. 
According to our requirement analysis of information services, main business components of hydrological information se rvices include data service components, geographical information service components, and computation and analysis service components. Data service components define all services necessary to visit can only be performed by calling some data service. For example, a data service component can be created to support hydrological data exchange. Geographical information service components provide particular access to geographic data and their spatial relationships concerned with all hydrological measurement stations, all measurement sections of main river courses and reservoirs, etc. 
Computation and analysis service components are focused on providing both ordinary hydrological analysis and adva nced specific data exploratory analysis. These components can realize the following functionalities: statistic analysis of hydrological information, frequency analysis of hydrological extreme value events, analysis of hydrological time-series, anal ysis of river courses, analysis of water resources, etc. Many interdisciplinary meth ods are incorporated to implement various computation and analysis of hydrological in formation at different levels. In fact, the methods of hydrology, statistics and more advanced data mining are all exploited together in these components. 3.4 Web Server Web server provides an interactive interface to different users. In order to meet user X  X  information requirements, various web pages are dynamically generated and maintained by Web server. It is in the charge of receiving users request, dispatching the received requests, getting results and sending responses to them. The final objective of integrating hydrological information is to break the bottleneck for sharing hydrological information and provide rich information services to the public. Hence on the part of the public users, the following functionalities of information services are realized: information search, information publication, information exchange, application services and personalized services ordering. 
Information search: it allows users to access through Internet the basic hydrological information associated with arbitrarily given measurement station, including water level, flow, sediment, pollution index of water, velocity of flow, evaporation, precipitation, etc. 
Information publication: it will regularly push through Internet last comprehensive hydrological information to users. The comprehensive hydrological information users concern may include analysis report on flood, rainfall, river courses change, water resource survey, riverbed silting, volume status of reservoir, etc. 
Application services: Different from information search and information publication, it provides more specific services to support many important applications, such as flood prevention, soil erosion control, sediment-water discharge regulation, planning of measurement station network, regulation and utilization of main reservoirs along Yellow calculation models, which are normally implemented at the application server as business logic components. To name a few, flood evolution model, river channel evolution model, sediment prediction model, comprehensive evaluation model of water quality, etc. information service. Often researchers from university and academic institution or governmental administration need specific hydrological information services for their demands and submit it to the system. Then this system will build certain service components to meet the personalized information. The personalized services can be obtained across Internet. 
Data exchange is aimed at enabling info rmation communication at the application level so that other applications can direct ly access authorized hydr ological information services. The main architecture of our implementation conforms to N-tiers structure with J2EE 3 platform at the middle tier, as shown in Fig. 2. The techniques exploited include DBMS for data management, JavaBeans for realizing business logics of hydrological information, JSP and Servlets for building Web pages to support interaction with clients, Web Services for supporting data exchange, etc. It follows the development principles of information systems set up for the  X  X igital Yellow River X  project 4. 
The client tier consists of applications and Browsers. It is responsible for representing data to users, interacting with user and communicating with the middle tier. The techniques used at this tier concern HTTP protocol, RMI protocol, simple object access protocol (SOAP), XML messaging and etc. It communicates with the middle tiers by the way of well pre-defined interfaces at the middle tier. It also can set up direct communication with the EIS in some specific cases that are authorized. The users can perform all operations at the client tier to get the information they need. For example, downloading hydrology table data of water level and flow related to one or more specific stations. Among other things, the middle tier includes two parts EJB Container and Web Container. Within EJB container, individual components are developed using JavaBeans techniques, which realize the hydrological busi ness computations. The applications at the client tier and the components in the Web container can directly call them to complete specific hydrological data directly calling some components in the EJB container through the SOAP protocol. All tasks related to Web processing are done within the Web container, such as serving HTML, instantiating Web page templates, and formatting JSP components in the EJB container are called and combined. For example, data exchange in the Web container must call some data services components in the EJB container. But for some tasks, they can also directly access data at the EIS tier without calling components in the EJB container. 
The EIS (Enterprise Information System) tier contains existing information systems, files, and database management systems, etc. For example, the real-time system of water-rain monitoring and forecasting, which is currently operated at Hydrology Bureau of Yellow River conversancy commission, is one of existing information systems, and partially established database of Yellow River hydrology by the end of 1980 X  X  is one of legacy databases. Java Connector architecture techniques5 are used to integrate existing application systems and database systems with our Web-oriented application management system of hydrological information, which is constructed by using a Web application server product such as IBM WebSphere or BEA WebLogic. Among many water problems, drought and water shortage particularly threaten north and northwest of china. Furthermore, such problems become more and more seriously as water demands rapidly grow due to the population growth, urbanization, and economic development. The situation of water resources in the Yellow River basin has close impact on national water problems and water strategies. Both scientific management and planning of water resources in the Yellow river basin are fatally important, so they must ground for water management and planning. This paper presented the framework of exchange. Hydrological information services built on the uniform data platform can much benefit lots of works related to basin water managements, such as real time water supply, control of the supply of water resources, assessment of water use, etc. Acknowledgement. we express our sincere thanks to Professor Yuguo NIU, Director of bureau of hydrology of YRCC for his strong su pport of our works.
