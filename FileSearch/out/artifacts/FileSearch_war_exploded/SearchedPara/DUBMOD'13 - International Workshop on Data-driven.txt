 Massive amounts of data are be ing generated on social media sites, such as Twitter and Facebook. These data can be used to better understand people (e.g., personality traits, perceptions, and preferences) and predict their behavior. As a result, a deeper understanding of users and their behavior can benefit a wide recommender systems, and pers onalized knowledge management. These applications will also bene fit individual users themselves and optimize their experience across a wide variety of domains, such as retail, healthcare, and education. Since mining and understanding user behavior from social media often requires interdisciplinary effort, including machine learning, text mining, human-computer interaction, and social science, our workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from multiple fields to discuss the creation of deeper models of individual users by mining the content that they publish and the social networking behavior that they exhibit. H.2.8 [ Database Management ]: Database Applications -Data Mining; J.4 [ Computer Application] : Social and Behavioral Sciences User Modeling, Social Media Analysis, Data-driven. People from all walks of life are using social media sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, to share data about social events, express opinions, discuss their interests, publicize businesses, recommend products, and, explicitly or implicitly, reveal personal information. Many research projects and commercial products have used this information to drive a variety of services, such as recommending local news stories [2], detecting events [3], determining group sentiment of products and brands [1], and smart crowd-sourcing [8]. The ma jority of this work, however, has focused on aggregating data acr oss many users. In contrast, our focus is to create deep models of individual users from social media, including the content users publish and the behavior that they exhibit. This has been an active area of research recently and conferences and workshops [4, 5, 6]. Various analytic techniques have been applied to infer users X  home location [7], gender [4, 6], 5], and personality [9]. Although there is abundant work in this area, there are many technical challenges remaining to be addressed. Our workshop aims to bring together researchers and experiences and discuss remaini ng challenges. While acquiring a deep understanding of users brings great benefits to businesses and individual users themselves, such an understanding may also reveal information that users would prefer to keep private. Such concerns are particularly important because individuals do not have complete control over the information they share about themselves; friends of a user ma y inadvertently divulge private information about that us er in their own posts. This workshop builds upon the success of our previously held workshops in conjunction with ACM IUI 2012 and ACM CIKM 2012 and focuses more on data-centric analysis and mining aspects of user and user be havior understanding from social media. In particular, we plan to solicit work on topics in one or more of the following areas: Analytics  X  Interactive visual analytics for understanding derived user  X  Integrated content and social network mining and analysis to  X  Mining of heterogeneous data s ources to derive user insights  X  Discovery of trustworthy information and information  X  Identification of significant user attributes (e.g., personality  X  Predictive analytics of user behavior  X  User behavior modeling and mi ning at scale using Big Data Feasibility/challenges of unders tanding individual users from social media  X  What aspects of an individual can be modeled from their  X  What aspects cannot be modeled?  X  What aspects should not be modeled?  X  How accurate are the models that can be extracted?  X  What are the best techniques to model user behavior?

We will hold a full-day workshop program on Oct, 28, 2013. The program begins with a welcome a nd keynote talk. After that there will be a madness session during which participants introduce themselves and their work in 5 minutes. Participants will be encouraged to make slides for the madness session, but this will not be required. Each paper session will conclude with a discussion led by a pre-chosen workshop participant. These discussions will tie together comm on themes of the presentations and hopefully lead to insightful di scussions about further research directions. There will be another keynote talk in the afternoon. The program will end with a pane l discussion where panelists will for future research.
