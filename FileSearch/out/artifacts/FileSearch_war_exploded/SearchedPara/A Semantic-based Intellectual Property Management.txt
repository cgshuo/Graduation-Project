 1. Introduction
In knowledge-based economy, the management of intellectual properties (IP) has become more and more important for an industry. It also plays an important role in technology manage-ment. For instance, a patent is a contract between an inventor and the government, whereby in return for full public disclosure of an invention, the government grants the inventor the right to exclude others for a limited time from making, using and selling the invention ( Hufker and Alpert, 1994 ). Many companies hold their patents not only as an invisible asset, but also as a strategy for its development and competition against its competitors in the market ( Jung, 2003 ). However, inventing a new patent is not an easy task. Some  X  X  X ovel X  X  ideas might impinge on some claimed rights protected by other X  X  patents. Therefore, before inventing a new patent, it should ensure that it does not infringe other X  X  patents by consulting with some global patent databases. In fact, the World Intellectual Property Organization revealed that from 90% to 95% of world X  X  inventions are found in patented docu-ments ( Brockhoff et al., 1999 ). The European Patent Office also disclosed that more than 80% of man X  X  technical knowledge is described in patent literature ( European Patent Office, 2010 ). By carefully analyzing the patent documents, it cannot only increase the efficiency and effectiveness of making new invention sub-stantially but also reduce the risk of infringing the patent rights of others ( Soo et al., 2005 ).

Patent documents analysis has often been employed to gen-erate economic indicators that gage the linkage between technol-ogy development and economic growth ( Campbell, 1983 ; Grandstrand, 1999 ; Grilliches, 1990 ; Holl et al., 2000 ), estimate technological knowledge flows and their impact on productivity ( Evenson and Puttnam, 1988 ; Scherer, 1982 ), compare innovative performance in international context ( Paci et al., 1997 ), evaluate the competitiveness of firms ( Narin and Noma, 1987 ), develop technology plans ( Mogee, 1991 ), prioritize R&amp;D investment ( Hirschey and Richardson, 2001 ), or monitor technological change in firms ( Archibugi and Pianta, 1996 ; Basberg, 1987 ). However, patent analysis requires considerable effort and expertise. It requires the analysts to have a certain degree of expertise in information retrieval, domain-specific technologies, and business intelligence. In addition, patent documents are often lengthy and rich in technical and legal terminology. It consumes a lot of time to read and analyze them even for experts. As a result, it is necessary to have an automated method for supporting the analysts in processing and analysis of massive patent documents as well as supporting technology innovation.

The paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 reviews the related work of the study which includes patent analysis, text mining, and keyword extraction. Section 3 describes the architecture and the components of the proposed system. Experiments and results for evaluating the system are provided in Section 4. The useful-ness and effectiveness of the system in a real-life environment have been studied in Section 5 through a practical implementa-tion of a prototype at a selected reference site. Section 6 is an overall conclusion of the paper, and some suggested areas for further work are also explored in this section. 2. Related work
Most studies in the patent analysis are on document search and classification ( Fall et al., 2003 ; Larkey, 1999 ; Lai and Wu, 2005 ;
Tsakalidis et al., 2002 ). A patent document contains a lot of items for analyses. Some of them are structured data. They are uniform in semantics and in format across patents such as patent number, filing date, or assignees. Some are unstructured data. They are free texts of various lengths and contents, such as claims, abstracts, or descriptions of the invention. Patent analyses based on structured information have been most practised approaches and have been found in the literature for years ( Archibugi and Pianta, 1996 ; Be X  X e X  X arrax and Huot, 1994 ; Ernst, 1997 ; Lai and Wu, 2005 ).
These structured data can be analyzed by bibliometric meth-ods, data mining techniques, or well-established database man-agement tools such as On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP). One type of structured data analyses is determined by citations ( Karki, 1997 ). For example, if a patent is cited by a large number of other patents, this cited patent is possibly a foundation of those citing patents and is thus important. In another example, since two patents related to the same invention tend to cite the same patent and are cited by the same patent, interpatent similarity can be determined by cocitation analysis. Using patent citation analysis,
Narin et al. (1984) evaluated corporate technological performance while Chakrabarti et al. (1993) analyzed the diffusion of techno-logical information among different organizations. Lai and Wu (2005) used citation-based interpatent similarity to perform a patent classification. Recently, there has been an interest in applying text mining techniques to assist the task of patent analysis and patent mapping ( Lent et al., 1997 ; Fattori et al., 2003 ; Yoon and Park, 2004 ).

Text mining can be viewed as data mining extended to text data to find implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful pat-terns from a large text repository ( Fayyad et al., 1996 ). It is an interdisciplinary area involving machine learning and data mining, statistics, information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP) ( Grobelnik et al., 2002 ). Text mining can work with unstruc-tured datasets such as full-text documents, HTML files, emails, etc.
NLP techniques are commonly used as the first step in text mining for converting the unstructured text into a structured format ( Milic-Frayling, 2005 ). The document can be featured by keywords that are extracted through text mining algorithms, and then other data mining techniques can be applied to retrieve interesting patterns. In relation to patent analysis, text mining is used as a data-processing and information-extraction tool. Since the original patent documents are expressed in text (natural language) format, it is necessary to transform raw data into structured data. Then, the process of keyword extraction is employed to identify keywords and to measure similarity between patents.
 In the present study, a Semantic-based Intellectual Property
Management System (SIPMS) is presented which attempts to address the shortcoming of the prior research in several respects.
It applies text mining to analyze the unstructured part of the patent documents. It extracts the key concepts of the patent documents and discovers the relations among the concepts based on the syntactic structure of the documents. This approach is able to extract concepts and relationships from the document itself rather than retrieved from predefined ontologies. Hence, it enables the approach to be applied in any domains without the need for the capture of prior knowledge. It also ensures that the intentions of the author of the document can be preserved using the words generated from the document itself. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm produces concepts and relationships based on multi-word text structures instead of individual words which makes the concept and relationship labels to be more complete.
Based on the proposed approach, the results of classification of the patents can achieve a higher accuracy.
 categories, which are dictionary (e.g. Braam and Moed, 1991 ; Callon et al., 1991 ; Zitt and Bassecoulard, 1994 ), statistical (e.g.
Cutting et al., 1992 ; Eisen et al., 1998 ; Karypis et al., 1994 ), and linguistic approaches (e.g. Rajaraman and Tan, 2002 ; SanJuan and Ibekwe-SanJuan, 2006 ).
 the forms, meanings and relationships between words and phrases.
By matching the dictionary with the words of sentences in each article, the concepts in the article are extracted. Relationships between the concepts are then coordinated based on the diction-ary. The major advantages of this approach are its efficiency of execution and ease of implementation. However, the prior key-word list is external to the documents. It reflects a general under-standing of the domain instead of the intention of the author of the document. Since words in the target articles cannot consist of new words, it requires further operations for handling these new words.
In the statistical approach, words are selected based on term weighting indices such as Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) or
Mutual Information (MI). It also eliminates the low frequency words so as to reduce the number of words being extracted.
However, this also results in the drastic elimination of more than half of the initial data from the analysis. Moreover, Price and
Thelwall (2005) have demonstrated the usefulness of low fre-quency words for scientific web intelligence (SWI). Removal of low frequency words results in documents becoming more general and similar. The linguistic approach makes use of semantic knowledge bases, heuristics, or rules to extract concepts. However, from a conventional linguistic approach, it is hard to make linguistic generalizations that can be applied reliably due to the occurrence of ambiguous words and ambiguous sentences structures. different objectives or goals. A multi-agent system (MAS) archi-tecture has been developed which consists of a collection of autonomous agents which have defined their own goals and actions and can interact and collaborate among each other through
XML communication. These agents act collectively and collaborate to achieve their own individual goals as well as the common goal. 3. The architecture of Semantic-based Intellectual Property Management System (SIPMS) based system which consists of three major processes which are pre-processing, patent analysis, and invention support. The com-bination of the algorithms is presented here for the first time for supporting technological innovation. 3.1. Pre-processing The pre-processing process consists o fextractionagent , segmentation agent, and indexing agent. This process aims at selecting the relevant patents, divide each patent into different sections and indexing the documents for further analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 , based on the user inputted filtering criteria, such as International
Patent Classification (IPC), the extraction agent keeps checking with the relevant patent documents from the external and internal patent databases. If there is a new patent, the agent extracts the patent based on a predefined patent schema. And it stores the patent document into the internal patent database.
After that, the segmentation agent divides the selected patents into a semi-structured format which include filing date, applica-tion date, assignees, IPC codes, title, abstract, claims, and descrip-tion of the invention. A regular expression matcher is devised to extract each of these segments.

The indexing agent converts the semi-structured format into concepts. It is accomplished by a concept extraction algorithm purposely developed by the authors. Generally, the subject of a sentence represents a concept. The object of a sentence, which is in the verbal phrase, represents a second concept. The algorithm extracts all the noun phrases inside the text and consolidates them into a list of key concepts. The unstructured text is first divided into tokens by regular expressions such as the new line character, full stop, question mark, etc. The tokens are then tagged with their parts-of-speech (POS) using a POS tagger developed by Schmid (1994) . The tags set is shown in the
Appendix A. Each token is merged with its nearby token as noun phrases based on their POS. For example, if the nearby token X  X  preposition  X  X  X f X  X , then the token are merged with the noun phrase.
The extracted concepts are then weighted by a hybrid weight-ing approach which is developed based on heuristic rules, semantic, and deep syntactic analysis. The method identifies the relationships among the extracted concepts so as to determine weights to them. It is assumed that a concept has a higher weight if the concept has more relationships with other concepts. In the present study, the heuristic rules analysis has been used to detect the simple syntactic patterns among tags in a timely and effective manner. Two basic heuristic rules are used as shown below: (a) Rule 1: when one term is the same as the other term and (b) Rule 2: a rule to detect abbreviations. Given two terms c
In semantic analysis, WordNet ( Miller, 1995 ) provides com-mon knowledge information to match words based on linguistic relations between them (e.g. synonyms, hyponyms). For instance, Alves et al. (2002) used WordNet to extract an initial hierarchy of nouns from a document to build an initial list of concepts, followed by several user feedback iterations to deduce relation-ships between pairs of concepts and hypothesize about their relations. Paik et al. (2001) defined a representation called concept X  X elation X  X oncept (CRC) triples. Their system analyzes raw text to construct a database of CRC triples based on semantic relations. In the present study, the system adapts the dataset of WordNet 2.1. There are 19 pointer symbols for nouns for representing the relationships between 2 nouns (e.g. hypernym, meronym, etc.). They are all classified having relations in this research. For example, canines is a hypernym of dog. Then we consider canines and dog have a relationship.

The third part of the method is based on a concept X  relationship acquisition and inference algorithm which is adapted from an automatic concept mapping algorithm ( Wang et al.,  X  X  X oncept X  X elationship X  X oncept X  X  format. In the present study, concepts have a semantic relationship if they constructed a  X  X  X oncept X  X elationship X  X oncept X  X  format after the concept map-ping algorithm analysis. For example, c 1  X   X  X ontent Management X  and c 2  X   X  X ontent Protection X  and the relationship between c c is  X  X onsists of X  then, relationship(c 1, c 2 ) is derived.
After that, the weighting of each concept is determined by Eq. (1) w  X  where w i is the weight of concept i , relationship ( c i , relationship between concept i and concept j , relationship ( c if concept i and concept j consist relationship, relationship ( c concept i and concept j do not consist relationship, n is the total number of extracted concepts. The unstructured text is then indexed with its key concepts and their corresponding weightings. 3.2. Patent analysis
The analysis process consists of a classification agent and a relationship agent for generating patent maps. It aims at provid-ing interesting patterns among a number of patent documents.
Classification is a powerful technique to detect topics and their relations in a collection. Various classification methods have been proposed, such as Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) ( Jain et al., 1999 ), Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) ( Kruskal, 1977 ), and Self-organization Map (SOM) ( Kohonen, 1997 ). Based on the indexed attributes of the patent documents, each docu-ment is processed into a vector form. In the present study, the patent classification agent makes use of a Naive Bayesian algo-rithm ( Mozina et al., 2004 ) to form categories. The relationship agent associates the related concepts among the indexed patent documents. The algorithm is built based on a self-associated concept mapping (SACM) algorithm, which is developed by the authors ( Wang et al., 2008 ). The graphical representation provides insights for describing the relationships among different knowl-edge concepts. A SACM is represented by a simple graph with nodes and edges. The nodes represent concepts relevant to a given domain and the association relationships between them are depicted by directed edges. An example of SACM is shown in
Fig. 3 . The importance of the concepts and the associations between different concepts are indicated by the depth of color i.e. darker color indicates higher importance.

As shown in Fig. 4 , the SACM consists of 3 major steps:  X  Assign the degree of importance of relation L ij for each  X  If the indexed text is the first record, the temporary SACM (ii) Step 2 : combining the temporary SACM with the original

The invention support process is accomplished by query agent and retrieval agent. They interact with the system users. The invention support process starts with entering the query of the invention problem or concepts by user. Then, the query agent extracts the key concepts from the query and looks up the related concepts based on the extracted concepts to invoke the retrieval agent to retrieve the patent documents that contain those related concepts. The classification agent and relationship agent are also invoked to depict the patterns among the retrieved documents. With the use of the classification agent, retrieved documents can be divided into different preset groups. Based on the SACM analysis, association between concepts can be depicted. Patent maps can be drawn for showing the important concepts and relationships among the patent documents. A snapshot of the patent map generated by the system is shown in Fig. 5 . 4. Experiments and results
A prototype of a Semantic-based Intellectual Property Manage-ment System (SIPMS) has been established using Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), Microsoft Visual Basic and Sun Java. A series of experiments have been carried out for comparing the results between the classifications using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and the proposed concept extraction indexing method. LSI is an indexing and retrieval method to identify patterns in the relation-ships between the terms contained in an unstructured collection of text ( Deerwester et al., 1990 ). It is an instance for comparing similarities between terms from documents using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and bag-of-words representation of text documents for detecting words with similar meanings ( Faure and Nedellec, 1998 ; Bisson et al., 2000 ).

For the testing data, the authors have used the abstracts of the patent documents collected from the United States Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO, http://www.uspto.gov ). They are well known databases and the quality of the text is highly assured.
Moreover, the main content of the patents are summarized in the abstract and they are highly referred by the knowledge workers. Three different categories (i.e. B32B3804, G06F01900 and H02G1100) are selected randomly from the database. The classes were classified based on international classification.
In the first experiment, 20 abstracts of patents are selected randomly from each of the classes for the experiments (i.e. 60 abstracts of patents in total). Some examples are shown in
Appendix C. After entering the texts of the abstracts of the patents, the concepts are automatically extracted. For example, a section of input text drawn from an US patent (US698096) as follows:  X  X  X n earth-moving vehicle includes a carriage, which can move on a terrain in mutually opposite directions of movement along a longitudinal axis of the vehicle, and a station for driving and maneuvering, which is able to rotate with respect to the carriage about a vertical axis, houses a plurality of controls, in Table 1 . K -fold cross-validation is used for the experiments ( McLachlan et al., 2004 ). In K -fold cross-validation, the original sample is divided into K subsamples. A single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining subsamples are used as training data. After indexing by the proposed and traditional method, the documents are then classified by Naive Bayesian algorithm and they are compared with the original international classes. The process is then repeated K times, with each of the K subsamples used once as the validation data. The results are then averaged to produce a single estimation. In the present study, 30-fold, 20-fold, 15-fold, 12-fold, 10-fold, 6-fold, 5-fold, and 1-fold cross-validations are used. The results are shown in Table 2 . From the results, it is interesting to note that the proposed method has outperformed the traditional method in all the validations. The averaged accuracy of classification improves from 5% to 10%.
 ability of the algorithm. 300 abstracts of the patents from the three categories (i.e. B32B3804, G06F01900, and H02G1100) were extracted from the USPTO database. 150 abstracts were used as the testing data, and the other 150 abstracts were used incremen-tally (with a 6 abstracts increment) as the training data. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 6 . It is found that the accuracy of the proposed method increases steadily with the increasing number of training data. And the accuracy starts to converge at around 48 training data (i.e. about 1/3 of the amount the testing data). Therefore, it shows that it is capable of processing a vast amount of data when the amount of training data increases. 5. Trial implementation
The methodology in Section 4 has been verified through a trial implementation at a selected reference site. The reference site is a RFID consultancy organization in Hong Kong. A prototype of the
SIPMS has been built for supporting its IP management and patent analysis. The organization was facing similar problems found in the industry, such as globalization, increasing competi-tion, and market and product information overload. It is necessary to develop an IPMS to improve IP sharing and management.
Through a study of the document and conducting interviews, the user requirements are collected after a study of the workflow of the company and collecting the required information such as the information flow of the company, the IP management process, the company expectations, etc. Then the project idea is proposed to the management level in order to obtain the management buy-in. This allows systematic handling of IP information and supports the technology invention process of the knowledge workers. After studying the workflow of the organization, a prototype system has been built for the implementation of the SIPMS. The func-tionalities of the system are designed and shown in Fig. 7 and a snapshot of the system is shown in Fig. 8 .
 The system provides the basic administrative activities of
IP which includes the documentations, maintenance manage-ment and data trend analysis. It provides a clear review to let the organizations know what th ey owned. It also facilitates the internal information flow, store IP assets information, and retains knowledge. The knowle dge workers of the organiza-tion are invited to provide users X  feedbacks of the usage of the system through survey questionnaires and interviews. The questionnaire is designed for ev aluating the system usefulness and effectiveness. For system usefulness, there are 13, 9, and 4 evaluation items related to IP portfolio, IP search, and customization, respectively. F or system effectiveness, there are 8, 7, and 7 evaluation items related to knowledge access, knowledge use, and knowledge c apture, respectively. The details of questionnaires can be found in Appendix B. Table 3 shows the results of the questionnaire evaluation. From the results, it is interesting to note that the users agree that the system can improve their work in different dimensions discussed above. 6. Conclusion and future work
Effective management of IP is essential for an organization to discover valuable knowledge hidden underneath the sea of information and knowledge. However, the conventional way of IP management which relies on the input of human experts is inadequate. This paper presents SIMPS which serves the purpose of incorporating semantic analysis and text mining techniques for processing and analyzing the unstructured patent documents.
The SIMPS allows for retrieving, automatically classifying, capturing and sharing right knowledge from massive unstruc-tured text under multiple concepts at different levels of abstrac-tion. With the successful development and trial implementation of the SIMPS, the accuracy of categorization of unstructured information is improved. It also allows an organization to capture the valuable knowledge embedded in the patent documents. This helps an organization to explore business opportunities for continuous business improvement. Comparing to the existing technologies, the proposed method extracts the key concepts of the patent documents and discovers the relations among the concepts based on the syntactic structure of the documents. This approach is capable of extracting concept and relationship from the document itself rather than retrieved from predefined dic-tionary. Hence, it enables the approach to be applied in any domains without initial knowledge capture.

For future work, the system should be evaluated on larger collections with more candidate users since the results are only preliminary as the number of documents considered is rather small. Furthermore, the current study focuses mainly on the unstructured text. However, lots of valuable information can be discovered from the images of patent documents. Further studies may focus on the analysis of different kind of information. Acknowledgments
