 1. Introduction
During the power system operation, it is difficult to determine its reliability level due to its dynamic nature. The reliability level could be expressed as the distance between the system X  X  actual state and the closest unreliable state. When the power system is at the lowest reliability level, an outage or a component failure may lead to either a complete system outage or a partial outage reducing its security and adequacy. For the entire system, one must consider two reliability factors: security, which depends on the system X  X  transient performance and adequacy, which depends on the available generation and transmission capacity covering operating reserve needs ( Porretta et al., 1991 ).

Numerous reports investigate the system security, adequacy, and reliability aspects of the power system operation. The security-oriented reports are mainly focusing on voltage security aspects, using the neural networks ( Liu et al., 1998 ; Jensen et al., 2001 )and simulation procedures such as part icle swarm method, multi-agent concept, and Monte Carlo sequential simulation ( Yoshida et al., high flows and low voltages security aspects using the probabilistic approach ( Wam et al., 2000 ).

The reports investigating the ad equacy issues are focusing on the power system robustness to withstand planned and unplanned outages, considering the generation and transmission capacities and their respective reserves. In the reports, generation adequacy and transmission network adequacy are assessed independently one of another ( Billinton and Gan, 1991 ; ISO New England Inc., 2008 )or jointly as composite power system adequacy ( Goel and Low, 2002 ), using the deterministic and probabilistic techniques. After the dramatic transmission network cascading events in the year of 2003, the UCTE has done several investigations on the UCTE system adequacy ( UCTE Annual Reports ) considering the generation and transmission network adequacy in the context of the European power market and electric power in terchange between UCTE zones. The UCTE System Adequacy Subgroup published the UCTE System Adequacy Forecast 2009 X 2020 ( UCTE, 2009 ). For the period from 2015 to 2020, this document identified the tightening situation with respect to the generating capacity with the remaining capacity decreasing drastically and the adequacy reference margin that cannot be respected. After 2015, additional investments in generat-ing capacity are required to maintain the level of adequacy at an appropriate level in the UCTE grid.

To determine the reliability level of the power system, differ-ent approaches have been applied. Some of them aim to detect the critical states by screening a set of contingencies and mark those which behave subversively. These approaches are able to estimate the state in which a system could face a failure rather precisely. The North American Reliability Association (NERC) has developed the acceptable reliability standards of the bulk power system in North America ( NERC Board of Trustees, 2008 ), similar to the role of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity ( ENTSO-E). A series of the operation handbooks has been published by ENTSO-E taking into account some reliability aspects based on the risk assessment philosophy ( UCTE OH  X  Policy 3, 2009 ). However, there is still no efficient method of recognizing the imminent onset of the unreliable operating state.

The fuzzy approach to the power system reliability level estimation proposed in this paper considers a power system current state with respect to the power system X  X  predefined fuzzy component limits. The result of this research can be viewed as twofold, comprising a static and a quasi dynamic state estimator with respect to the power system reliability. The static estimator is used for scheduling a normal operating regime, while the dynamic one could be applied in a contingency case. The pro-posed approach allows for combined insight about security and adequacy aspect of a power system state.

The paper is organized as follows. Fuzzy rendering of power system operation and the proposed algorithms are presented in
Section 2, in which a composite fuzzy security, adequacy, and reliability indices are describ ed along with the appropriate algorithms for their calculation. In Section 3, the power system variables are represented via fuzzy numbers in the proposed security framework composed of three segments: generation segment, transmission segment, and segment of nodes. Section 4 discusses the power system operation variables in the proposed adequacy framework, represented via fuzzy numbers. Two test systems, IEEE Three Area RTS-96 and Bosnian power system are used in Section 5 to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach.
Conclusions are drawn in Section 6. Finally, Appendix presents data on Bosnian power system used in purpose of calculation. 2. Fuzzy rendering of power system operation and proposed algorithms
For the complex power system operation, a soft approach is used to present the interaction of the system components and segments. The fuzzy power system reliability level is calculated on the bases of the fuzzy security and adequacy levels. First the power system segment is characterized by the smallest security membership grade (SMG) of its components. Each power system segment dictates its own security level and correspondingly affects the power system global security level. The fuzzy power system adequacy level is presented through the fuzzy adequacy indices, such as the adequacy of the generation capacity, trans-mission capacity, and transmission integration. This approach allows one to calculate a joint fuzzy level of the power system security, adequacy, and reliability using the composite fuzzy security index (CFSI), composite fuzzy adequacy index (CFAI), and composite fuzzy reliability index (CFRI).

The binary mapping is used in aggregation of the relevant security membership grades (SMGs) of the segment components to find the smallest SMG of each of the system segments. The binary mapping is based on the binary operator T ( Nguyen and Kreinovich, 1998 ; Baldwin, 1996 ). By means of the Larsen implication rule ( Larsen, 1980 ) the smallest SMGs are multiplied with each other to find CFSI. The same implication rule is used in aggregating the adequacy membership grades (AMGs) of the system adequacy segments in the phase of CFAI calculation. CFRI is found out by multiplying the given CFSI and CFAI with each other.
 The approach makes use of an adapted Bellman X  X adeh model. If its reliability membership grade m ( ri ) : S -[0,1]. Here m the grade of membership in a continuous domain of a particular level s

A composite fuzzy security index s i can be expressed as (1) where the fuzzy operator 4 of the right-hand side of (1) represents the minimum of the relevant compo-nent SMGs m pss  X  s i  X  X  m 1 4 ... 4 m i 4 ... 4 m n  X  1  X  where S is the set of the power system operating states, m

 segments pass through, exerting an influence upon the security state of a whole power system. The security level is expressed as a distance between a current and the most imminent of the warning operating states, which is characterized by CFSI  X  0. It may warn the system operator to undertake adequate corrective actions, i.e. increase the power reserve given the SMG of genera-tion segment m gs  X  0; to prevent a transmission line outage due to possible loading increase given the SMG of transmission segment m tr  X  0; or voltage collapse of a node given the SMG of segment of nodes m ns  X  0. Namely, the consequences of a power system operation in the operating state marked by CFSI  X  0 can be severe.

 formed by Larsen implication rule (3), which produces a new fuzzy set with a membership function m agg ( s i ). It implies the following product operation: R  X  A B C  X  where  X  X   X  X  is the algebraic product operator, and m A ( x ), m ( z ) are the smallest SMGs of x in A , y in B , and z in C aggregated as ( x , y , z )in A B C .

Therefore, CFSI depends on the operating states of all power system segments whose variables are described as trapezoidal fuzzy number set with a normal, convex and continuous member-ship grade of a bound support. The proposed procedure is presented as a block-diagram in Fig. 2 . 2.2. A composite fuzzy adequacy index The fuzzy power system state adequacy level defined by the
CFAI, which takes into account power system adequacy segments (psas) and their adequacy membership grades m psas of installed generation and transmission capacity for current power system operating state s i can be determined as (4) CFAI  X  system adequacy segment of generation, transmission, and trans-mission integration, respectively, m psa ( si ) is the AMG for power system operation state s i , i.e. the CFAI.

As an algebraic product of the adequacy segment membership grades, CFAI is a function of the states that the power system segments pass through influencing each other as in Fig. 3 .Itis expressed as a distance between the current operating state and the state with a warning adequacy level characterized by CFAI  X  0. It warns the system operator and planner to undertake adequate actions.

The product of the three adequacy segment membership functions is formed by the Larsen implication rule, as in the case of the CFSI calculation. Therefore, CFAI depends on the adequacy levels of the planning and operating states of all power system segments. All the adequacy variables are described as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. The procedure for a CFAI calculation is presented as a block-diagram in Fig. 4 . 2.3. A composite fuzzy reliability index

CFRI is a function of the states that the power system security and adequacy segments pass through and which influence the reliability level of the whole power system. Again, reliability is expressed as a distance between the current and the warning state of reliability. The overall warning operational state is characterized by CFRI  X  0. 3. The power system operation variables in the security framework represented via fuzzy numbers 3.1. Generation segment I: power system reserve
The power reserve is required in each power system to over-come disturbances. The reserve quantification depends on the uncertainties that may affect the power system operation. There are two types of power reserve: the active and the reactive reserve.

The variability of the active power reserve in a power system is subject to a fuzzy limitation shown in Fig. 5 . The limitations belong to both active spinning and supplemental power reserves necessary to stabilize the system X  X  frequency. In this case, APR and SMG  X  0 indicate the dangerous limit. The algorithm to obtain the minimal necessary active power reserve APR 1 is discussed in ( Halilc  X  evic  X  and Gubina, 1999 ).

The fuzzy variability of the active power reserve is represented as a one-sided trapezoidal fuzzy number with its SMG given in
The same procedure is used for the reactive power reserve. 3.2. Generation segment II: excitation system capacity measurement The field current is presented by a two-sided trapezoidal fuzzy
SMG expressed in (7) and illustrated in Fig. 6 where i flim 1 represent a lower and upper limit, and they are taken as absolute values  X 
A similar analysis can be applied to a generator armature current limitation. In our calculations, the following field current limits have been used for a generator of a 200 MW nominal power: i 3.3. Transmission segment I: transmission line loadability and thermal limits zoidal fuzzy set SMG m s
Margin ( ETSO ) and smaller flows do not endanger the system. The thermal safety margin allows a further increase in load of either 10% or 20% before reaching S lim corresponding to the thermal line rating ( European Commission Directorate-General Energy and
Transport, 2001 ). The line power flow fuzzy membership function is shown as a one-sided trapezoidal fuzzy number in Fig. 7 . 3.4. Transmission segment II: power transformer temperature described by an IEEE standard ( IEEE Guide, 1991 ), is considered to be an operating limit in defining SMG for a power transformer temperature, Fig. 8 . The relevant SMG can be expressed as 3.5. Segment of nodes I: voltage stability factors power system. A load increase and an inadequate local reactive supply cause high local power losses a nd a detrimental voltage level. In this research, the BSDC criterion has been applied (  X  et al., 2008 ), which considers two consecutive measurements ( k and k  X  1) of voltage and current phasors in a selected load bus.
In the vicinity of voltage instability, an increase of the apparent power of the lines feeding the bus no longer matches its load requirement. This means D S  X  0 at the line relay point when voltage instability occurs. The BSDC criterion is defined as BSDC  X  1  X 
Voltage instability takes place when the magnitude ratio a  X  1 and phase shift j  X  p coincide. In such circumstances, D S  X  0 and BSDC  X  0.

The voltage instability fuzzy membership function includes the BSDC 1 and BSDC lim limits, Fig. 9 . In a healthy system with nominally loaded components, the index approaches BSDC  X  1.
A fuzzy set of BSDC is described by the following membership function:  X  3.6. Segment of nodes II: a voltage magnitude
The bus voltage level SMG is represented as a two-sided trapezoidal fuzzy set (12) and Fig. 10 . V 1 and V 2 represent the marginal values of the voltage levels that are within a normal voltage range. Between these values, including them too, SMG  X  1. The V min.all and V max.all represent the minimal and maximal allowed voltage values  X  4. Power system operation variables in an adequacy framework represented via fuzzy numbers 4.1. The generation segment
Variability of the generation adequacy in a power system is subject to a fuzzy limitation shown in Fig. 11 .

The generation adequacy ( GA ) fuzzy variability is represented as a one-sided trapezoidal fuzzy number with its AMG m gen. as where GA is the hours of the system X  X  load interruption caused by an insufficient generation (when a load demand is greater than the available capacity). The GA is computed as follows: GA  X  T U GLOEE System Average Load in MW  X  14  X  where T is the study period in hours, GLOEE is the loss of energy expectation due to an inadequate generation over T (years), GLOEE is obtained by the Monte Carlo simulation in a generation capacity adequacy assessment, GA 1 is the system X  X  load interrup-tion time, and GA lim is the limit of the system X  X  load interruption time. 4.2. The transmission segment
Variability of the transmission adequacy in a power system is subject to the same fuzzy limitation shown in Fig. 11 . The fuzzy transmission adequacy ( TA ) is represented as a one-sided trape-where TA is the hours of the system X  X  load interruption caused by an insufficient transmission. It is computed by means of the following formula: TA  X  T U TLOEE System Average Load in MW  X  16  X  where T is the study period in hours (in our test case, it is a period of the last five years), TLOEE is the loss of energy expectation due to an inadequate transmission (MWh/year) over T (years) obtained by the Monte Carlo simulation of capacity adequacy assessment, TA 1 is the hours of the system X  X  load interruption due to an inadequate transmission, and TA lim is the limit hours of the system X  X  load interruption due to an inadequate transmission. 4.3. The transmission integration segment
The transmission integration adequacy index (TIAI) is an expected value of the bottled generation, i.e. a power that due the inadequate transmission connection in certain parts of the power system fails to get supplied to the consumers. It is based on the off-line analysis taking into consideration combinations of the transmission infrastructure, generating plants, and the consump-tion centers and uses the expected demand-not-supplied due to inappropriate transmission integration EDNSTI (MW/year) throughout T (years) obtained by the Monte Carlo simulation: TIAI  X  T U EDNSTI  X  17  X 
TIAI is subject to the same fuzzy limitation as it is shown in ( Fig. 11 ). Fuzzy variability of the transmission integration is represented as a one-sided trapezoidal fuzzy number set. Its where TIAI 1 is a border value of TIAI still within a fuzzy set of the the undesired values. It indicates that some of the operating points should be avoided and that some parts of the transmission infrastructure should be changed or strengthened. 5. Test cases 5.1. The IEEE three area RTS-96 test system
An updated version of the original IEEE RTS is used to verify the results of the proposed algorithm ( The IEEE Reliability Test
System  X  1996, 1999 ). The total load of 3135 MW and 638 MVAr, and the outage of line C35 between bus 323 and bus 325 connecting area 3 and area 1 are considered first.
 This power system operation state is not secure after of line
C35 outage causing overload of the transmission line between bus 318 and bus 223 and CFSI  X  0. It requires a load reduction measure. If the load of line C35 has a limit of 350.15 MVA, and if it coincides with an outage of generators ID118 and ID218, one faces a loading increase by up to 90% on line CB-1 with SMG  X  0.7, the smallest SMG in the transmission segment. It reduces the power reserve in regions 1 and 2 yielding the smallest SMG of generation segment in region 2 ( m gs  X  0.55). Furthermore, it reduces the voltage amplitude SMG at node 217 to a smallest value ( m ns  X  0.8) for the segment of nodes and brings CFSI to 0.31. m tr.integr.  X  1.0. AMGs are calculated based of the following data:
GA  X  25 min, GA 1  X  60 min, GA lim  X  90 min, TA  X  8min, TA
TA lim  X  30 min, TIAI  X  11 MW, TIAI 1  X  15 MW, and TIAI lim
The current index values are based on the data in ( Porretta et al., 1991 ), and the limiting values are based on the NERC standards
CFAI, CFRI  X  0.31. Tables 1 and 2 present a resume of the security, adequacy, and reliability states of the aforementioned cases. additionally, some power system segments or their components reach the area of the lower SMG values. Fig. 12 presents the changes of CFSI, CFAI, and CFRI in function o f the different power system load levels. There are two cases presented: the one with transmission lines AB2 (230 kV) and B21 (230 kV), the other without them. 5.2. A Bosnia and Herzegovina power system case voltage levels system (220 and 400 kV), Fig. 13 , with thirty nodes (one reference node, nine P  X  V nodes, twenty P  X  Q nodes), thirty transmission lines (seven 400 kV lines, twenty-three 220 kV lines), and three 400/220 kV substations.
 values of the power system components, and the dynamic with the power quantities data of the current power system operation state. The B&amp;H power system operating state data is gathered on October 21, 2008, and is shown in Appendix, Tables A.1 and A.2 .
Table A.3 brings forward the data which were taken on October 21, 2008 in the power plants of the B&amp;H power system. The results of CFSI, CFAI, and CFRI for the chosen operation state are given in Tables 3 and 4 .

The value of the spinning reserve is 51% of the requested one. Due to this, SMG of the generation segment is 0.6616. As a consequence,
CFSI is 0.6616 (SMG of the transmission and node segments is 1). In this case, there are two possible actions to obtain the requested spinning reserve: one is to start a new generator, and second one is to use spinning reserve from a neighboring power system.
The timeline of the power system reliability during the three events, A, B, and C is presented in Fig. 14 and summarized in
Table 5 . Following the Event A, a transformer outage between buses 25 and 23, CFSI is calculated to be 0.5026. SMGs of the system X  X  segments (nodes, generation, and transmission) are 1.0, 0.6583, and 0.7635, respectively. At the same time, CFAI happens to be 0.85. AMGs of all system X  X  adequacy segments are 1.0, 1.0, and 0.85 ( m tr.integr.  X  0.85 due to TIAI  X  15.75 MW), respectively. Finally, CFRI is found to be 0.427.

The Event B, start of the node-4 generator with capacity of 50 MW, occurs right after Event A, with the transformer between 12 14 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 CFRI buses 25 and 23 still out of operation. It leads to the following results: SMGs of nodes, generation, and transmission are 1.0, 1.0, and 0.8169, respectively; AMGs are 1.0, 1.0, and 1.0, respectively, and CFRI amounts to 0.8169.

The Event C, the increasing the node-4 generator reactive power to 20 MVAr, occurs after the Event B. The SMGs of the nodes, generation, and transmission are 1.0, 1.0, and 0.9341, AMGs of all three adequacy segments are 1.0, 1.0, and 1.0, and CFRI assumes a new value of 0.9341.
 The calculations for both test cases were conducted on Intel Pentium processor 2.80 GHz with 2048 MB RAM using Math-
Works SimPower Systems and Fuzzy Logic Toolbox. Neither of the presented calculations took more of 9 s. 6. Conclusion
The paper addresses continuous estimation of a power system current operation security, adequacy, and reliability via a deter-ministic approach and fuzzy reasoning. It enables the system operators to have on-line insight into state of the system X  X  reliability and has been tested on two power systems. The tests on several contingencies show that the new algorithm assesses the power system reliability using the states of the power system components during the normal operation and during contingen-cies including the voltage stability. The algorithm conceptually allows an inclusion of more phenomena and could be exploited for planning. Several contingencies are investigated that could have an impact on the system reliability.
