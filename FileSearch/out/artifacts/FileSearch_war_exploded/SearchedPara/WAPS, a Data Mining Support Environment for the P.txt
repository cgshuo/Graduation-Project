 WAPS (WArranty Planning System) is a Data Mining support environment which is developed within a cooperation between DaimlerChrysler Research &amp; Technology, Ulm and the Sales and Services Direction, Stuttgart. Data Mining modelling is performed in WAPS by using an innovative approach based on regression analysis taking into account the structural change of warranty and goodwill costs data. In this paper, we describe the different development phases of WAPS. Data Mining, regression analysis, structural change The warranty planning in the automobile industry is characterized by several by problems: the need to calculate planning figures for cash reserves within the balance caused by legal or voluntary obIigations in the context of warranty and goodwill a growing number of actually manufactured vehicles and a growing number of production plants all over the world, resulting into a more complex and mulitlayered production structure a different warranty and goodwill policy for different sales markets. The system WAPS, that is the result of a joint project between DaimlerChrysler Research &amp; Technology and the Sales and Services Direction, should master the business needs described above. It covers the warranty cost forecast for nine passenger car series which are actually under production and four passenger car series whose production has run out. However, these four series still cause warranty and goodwill costs. To have a picture about the complexity of the problem, it should be mentioned that in each planning period (3 times for each budget year) WAPS delivers prediction costs for totally 520 separate segments caused by the following factors: l 13 passenger car series (5 series for the S-Class, 2 for the E-Class, 4 for the C-Class, 1 for the A-Class and 1 for the M-
Class 5 vehicle body versions (limousine, station wagon, coupe, cabriolet, roadster) 2 types of engine (petrol and Diesel engine) 4 sales markets for the series (Germany, Europe, USA, Rest of World) Up to now the warranty cost prediction has been realized by using a conventional planning method based on the amount of warranty and goodwill costs observed in the last budget year. This amount is modified by information available about the expected inflation, about the quality index of the vehicles and about the development of the sales figures for the different vehicle series. Some of this information is rather qualitative than quantitative requiring the additional expert knowledge to estimate the effects on the amount of the budget. This is a complicated procedure that takes about four weeks for each planning period and requires involving different experts from several departments. Regarding the fact that an enormous data stock stored about the vehicles and their behaviour in the context of warranty and goodwill costs is available, the question coming up was whether it is possible to use Data Mining technology and construct an automatic prediction tool based only on historical data which are available for the warranty and goodwill costs. This has led to the system WAPS that will be described in the next sections. After some discussion with the end users, it was decided to implement a system that, in contrast to the traditional approach, should use as input only the historical data on warranty costs. Furthermore, the system should have the following properties: it should reduce the planning time standardization of the planning process for each vehicle series high scale of automation for the warranty and goodwill planning process providing information about the general quality of vehicle series, their body versions and their motor variants in the different sales markets around the world 
In this section we discuss the structure and source of the data relevant for the analysis and prediction of warranty and goodwill costs. The available historical data about warranty costs is a part of the database QUIS (Quality and Information System) that can be considered as a kind of data warehouse containing information on produced vehicles and their damages. The fundament of QUIS is a normalized database model including more than fifty tables with more than 400 fields. The most extensive table contains more than 110 million rows. Figure 1 describes the process environ-ment of data generation and data collection for QUIS. production plant n repair workshops The Data Mining task needed to implement WAFS is a prediction task. To implement the appropriate prediction model, it was a huge number of possible variables which could be considered as appropriate attributes for the Data Mining model. The classical statistical approaches like correlation analysis or factor analysis were not applicable in a reasonable time. To reduce the complexity of the search space, we had extensive discussions with the end users resulting in choosing the so-called warrun@ and goodwill rate (WG-Rate) as a base for model attributes. The WG-Rate describes the average cost per vehicle sold within a certain sales market. This rate is generally calculated for each month of production and comprises all realized costs caused by the repair or replacement of failed or damaged vehicle parts. Each rate is related to a certain operating time of the vehicle. The operating time is divided into specific operating intervals. The used intervals in WAPS have the lengths of 3,6,9, 12,15 etc. months. Figure 2 gives an example for the development of warranty and goodwill rates over 3 production years. The second step was to extract the needed attributes of QUIS by using appropriate database queries in order to calculate the WG-Rates in a further step. Each vehicle series requires two different queries, one for the general vehicle data and one for the commercial data generated in the system VEGA according to the warranty and goodwill claims of the repair workshops (see Figure The raw data generated in the second step are used to calculate 
WG-Rates as attribute values for the prediction model. In addition to this raw data we need other input data as well which are processed in a third step by a large Visual Basic module within an

After some initial trials we have distinguished that some special refinements of the input data for the prediction models would increase the prediction performance: 1. Replacement of the production date by the date of car 2. Construction of correction factors for the WG-Rates to 
Besides the statistical approaches like regression analysis, regression and model trees, SMART, Naive Bayes etc. one can use also alternative approaches based on neural networks. After some initial trials we have selected the regression analysis as a representative for the statistical approaches and a Back-propagation network as a representative for neural approaches. The selection of the regression approach was supported by the fact that earlier investigations have shown that methods like time series analysis lead to very poor prediction quality for the warranty and goodwill cost budget, as described in [2]. The next step was to design an evaluation plan to compare the both alternatives and to select the best one. The following measures were chosen as criteria for the evaluation of the prediction performance of these two models: 
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) 
Standard Deviation (STDV) Theil X  X  U The input variables for both models were WG-Rates in the early and the target variables were WG-Rates in the later operating time of vehicles. The evaluation in the testing time has shown that there is no significant difference between the prediction performance of two alternative approaches if we use STDV and Theil X  X  U as comparison criteria. Using of MAPE (one example of the performance of the two approaches is given in figure 3), however, analysis is the favorite model. Concerning these results and the fact that regression analysis is easier to implement in comparison to a neural network approach we have decided to select the regression model for further consideration. This model was however refined in further steps. Especially, we have tried to capture the dynamic aspects and structural changes of the WG-Rates by refining the regression model. This can be considered as an innovative approach in the implementation of WAPS. For details of the implementation of structural changes within a regression analysis model, we refer to WAPS can test now if a structural change has occurred in the past. whole time, the system switches to a piecewise regression approach taking into account the structural change by dividing the whole time space into several subspaces. During its development in the past two years, WAPS has been used besides the conventional planning method in order to test its practicability in prediction of the total annual budget for warranty and goodwill in the passenger car section. The results were very promising. The needed planning time is 75% shorter than the time using the conventional method. Figure 4 shows an example of the performance of the two approaches for the planning years 1997 and 1998. It can be seen that the absolute percentage deviation between the predicted and realized warranty costs is lower using WAPS. During its development, we could convince the users that WAPS is not only able to support the planning process for warranty and goodwill costs and to provide additional security for the calculated planning figures, but it is able also to support the calculation of the amount of balance cash reserves for warranty and goodwill obligations in considerable shorter time. In this connection, the fmal version of WAPS which is implemented in Visual Basic for PC, is in use in the Sales and Services Department of DaimlerChrysler in Stuttgart. WAPS has an open architecture which allows to implement further prediction models, e.g. models that can perform the reliability analysis of vehicle parts with high warranty and goodwill costs. We would like to express our deep gratitude to the colleagues of the department VSE/PG within the Sales and Services Direction of DaimlerChrysler in Stuttgart for the generous and trustful cooperation during the development of WAPS.
