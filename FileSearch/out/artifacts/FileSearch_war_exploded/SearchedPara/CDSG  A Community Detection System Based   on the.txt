 Peizhong Yang, Lihua Zhou (  X  ) , Lizhen Wang, Xuguang Bao, and Zidong Zhang Communities are groups (or clusters) of nodes that are densely interconnected, but and communities are usually overlapped (i.e. nodes simultaneously belong to more than one group). Nowadays, community detection has not been settled satisfactory, although there are many algorithms have been proposed [2]. 
As a very useful mathematical theory for studying the complex conflict and coop-eration amongst rational agents, methods that based on the cooperative and non-cooperative game theory have been used separately to solve community detection problems [3,4] in recent years. However, cooperative game theory-based methods have high efficiency but low accuracy, while non-cooperative game theory-based methods have high accuracy but low efficiency. 
In this paper, we develop a game theory-based community detection system (CDSG) that combines cooperative and non-cooperative game theory to detect com-munities in large networks. Unlike previous works, CDSG plays cooperative and non-cooperative game in two consecutive phases rather than play them separately. CDSG can detect overlapping and non -overlapping communities with high accuracy, it also has high efficiency such that it is applicable for large-scale networks, and it is easy to use because it does not require a priori knowledge on the number and size of com-complex networks and improving services. The game theory-based community detection system (CDSG) contains five modules that are shown in Figure 1 (a). 
The data module is used to read real networks, benchmark networks, or purpose-built synthetic networks from files or databases located by users. Each file consists of the number of nodes and a list of edges (source target). 
The group game module carries out the cooperative game in which agents are modeled as rational agents trying to achieve and improve group X  X  utilities by coope-merged into larger coalitions. The game ends when no coalition has an interest in performing a merge operation any further. 
The individual game module carries out the non-cooperative game in which each agent is modeled as a selfish agent, who selects independently coalitions from the lapping coalitions can be identified. The game ends when no agent has an interest in this time is regarded as the last community structure of a network. community of its own, the number of agents that will change their memberships to improve their utilities will decrease, thus ef ficiency of non-cooperative game will be improved. The combination of cooperative and non-cooperative game makes utilities of groups and individuals can be taken into account simultaneously, thus the accuracy has been improved. Configuration Module 
The configuration module allows users to set parameters needed for carrying out the individual game, i.e. the lower bound of the utility value that an agent can join a new coalition and the upper bound of the utility value that an agent can leave the cur-rent coalition that it is in. NMI Module 
The NMI module computes the Normalized mutual information ( NMI ) between the detected community structure and the underlying ground truth thus the community structures detected by different stages can be compared quantificationally. Output Module 
The output module displays the community structures detected by the group game following with the members of each coalition. Here we use the community detection of Zachary X  X  network of Karate [5] as an ex-ample scenario. Figure 1 (b) shows the results of CDSG: the left of the window shows the member of each community and its utility, while the right of the window visualiz-es the network and their community structures.
