 Noisy unstructured text data is ubiquitous in real-world communication. Natural language and the creative ways that humans use it can create problems for computational techniques. Electronic text from the Internet (emails, message boards, newsgroups, blogs, microblogs, wikis, chatlogs and web pages), contact centers (complaints, emails, call transcriptions, message summaries), and mobile phones (SMS) is often noisy  X  contains spelling errors, abbreviations, non-standard words, false starts, repetitions, missing punctuation, missing case information and special characters. Informal communications are not the only source of noisy text; Text produced by processing signals intended for human use such as printed/handwritten documents, spontaneous speech, and camera-captured scene images, are also noisy.
 The Fourth workshop in the AND series contains high-quality work spanning a large array of disciplines related to the treatment of Noisy text. This year AND is collocated with CIKM so the flavor of IR and KM shows through in the AND program as well.
 The final program consists of 11 papers selected from 21 submissions. Each paper was carefully reviewed by three Program Committee members. We would like to thank our Program Committee for selecting this high-quality program for AND 2010.
 Papers in which a student is the primary author (first author/presenter) will be eligible for the IAPR Best Student Paper Award. The initial short listing for this award has been done based on the reviews. The final decision will be made during the workshop based on the presentations.
 Also the best papers from the workshop will appear in a special issue of the International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition after going through further reviewing. The selection for this is based on the reviews of the AND PC members.
 We are excited to have Randy Geobel, University of Alberta, Canada, as the keynote speaker. His talk is very interestingly titled  X  X he nature of noise in linguistic corpora. X  We thank our organizing and program committees for their many valuable inputs and thoughtful reviews. We thank the International Association for Pattern Recognition for endorsing this workshop and instituting the best student paper award.
