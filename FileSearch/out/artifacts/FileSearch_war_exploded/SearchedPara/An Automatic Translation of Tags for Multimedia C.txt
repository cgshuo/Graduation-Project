 This paper proposes a novel method to translate tags at-tached to multimedia contents for cross-language retrieval. The main issue in this problem is the sense disambiguation of tags given with few textual contexts. In order to solve this problem, the proposed method represents both tags and its translation candidates as networks of co-occurring tags since a network allows richer expression of contexts than other ex-pressions such as co-occurrence vectors. The method trans-lates a tag by selecting the optimal one from possible can-didates based on a network similarity even when neither the textual contexts nor sophisticated language resources are available. The experiments on the MIR Flickr-2008 test set show that the proposed method achieves 90.44% accuracy in translating tags from English into German, which is sig-nificantly higher than the baseline methods of a frequency-based translation and a co-occurrence-based translation.

With the success of social Web services, there is a large amount of multimedia content on the Web. Most of them are pictures and video clips uploaded by users of the ser-vices. Some websites such as Flickr, YouTube and Picasa encourage their users to upload and share their multimedia contents through folksonomy tagging systems.

Even if the contents like pictures and videos are often universal, many of them are hidden behind the language barrier. A Chinese speaker is able to see and understand pictures uploaded by an English speaker, and vice versa. However, current image search systems are based on matches between query keywords and tag annotations attached to the contents, which makes it difficult for the contents to be shared among speakers of different languages.

It is often a crucial skill for image search to use more than one language. This is because some images are more richly tagged with foreign languages. For example, the term  X  X article accelerator X  in the Korean language yields almost no images. Similarly,  X  X imchi making X  in English reveals few useful images. In addition, even when a relevant image annotated with one language is found, the images that are more relevant can be retrieved with other languages. For ex-ample, assume that you are looking for a bird X  X -eye-view of a newly built particle accelerator located at CERN. The first search would probably include tags of  X  X article accelerator X  and  X  X ERN X . This query would yield hundreds of pictures, and some of them provide the requested view. However, the translated expressions like  X  X eilchenbeschleuniger X  or  X  X c-c  X el  X erateur de particules X  would yield even more and better results, since this item is located in the German and French-speaking area.

A cross-language image retrieval system can translate ei-ther the attached annotations or the queries. Most of the previous researches of cross-language image retrieval were based on query translation [11, 5, 13]. The simplest method is to use all possible translations [11], in which the senses of query words are not disambiguated in the translation pro-cess. Other approaches try to resolve the disambiguation by measuring the coherence of a translation candidate to the entire query [13, 4]. Typically, the coherence score of a translation candidate is computed using word co-occurrence statistics. A translation candidate of a query word is as-signed with a high coherence score when it co-occurs fre-quently with the translations of other query words.
Translation of queries is simpler than that of tags due to their compact volume, but it does not provide enough information to users who are browsing the search result. The tags attached to a multimedia content should be readable to the users who browse it. By translating queries only, the users are able to find some relevant contents with foreign tags; however, they fail in reading the annotated tags. Thus, it is difficult for the users to refine or extend the query after observing tags of the contents.

Tag translation can be considered as a solution to this problem. The most critical issue in both tag translation and query translation is to select the most probable translation candidate of each tag or query word. This is often called translation selection [4] or lexical translation problem [3]. The advantage of tag translation over query translation in this point of view is that tags provide additional information. The multimedia contents have an additional context that is generated by tagging activities of the users. These tag annotations of content sharing systems are often referred to as folksonomy .

This paper proposes a simple and elegant method for solv-ing the sense disambiguation in tag translation using the folksonomy network. A tag set for each multimedia content can be represented as a single network that connects the tag words through folksonomy. A word can have several senses. Therefore, the network of the tag set in the source language is compared with multiple networks in the target language, since the structures of the networks in the target language are different from one another according to the translation candidates of the tag set. Among the possible networks in the target language, the most similar network to the tag network in the source language is chosen as the most prob-able translation of the tag set. A network kernel derived from convolution kernels [8] is adopted as a measure of the similarity between networks.

The superiority of the proposed method is shown by com-paring it with a frequency-based method and a coherence-based method. The experiments on the MIR Flickr-2008 set to translate English tags into German tags show 90.44% of accuracy in tag translation, which is significantly higher than the baseline methods. The proposed method is well suited for the environments where just a few or no text con-texts other than tags are available. In addition, it does not rely on expensive language resources like parallel corpora. Thus it can be easily adopted into minor languages with-out such resources. The method also utilizes the context of the source language which is often ignored in the coherence-based translation methods.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related works. Section 3 explains the approach of translation disambiguation by network comparison. Section 4 proposes the network similarity and Section 5 shows the results of the experiment. Finally, Section 6 draws conclu-sions.
An obvious approach to cross-language image retrieval is to translate queries with legacy machine translation (MT) systems. For example, a site such as de.yahoo.com provides an option to translate queries automatically with commer-cial MT systems like Systran. However, the general MT systems applied to query translation are easy to fail in com-prehending the exact sense of the query words. For example, in such systems, a query word  X  X pring X  is usually translated into the sense of a season (the most frequent sense used in the general domain). Thus, other senses such as recoil de-vices or water springs are lost.

To address this problem, some researches adopted interac-tive methods. Panimages meta search is one such example [3]. It receives query words from a user, and then shows all sense indexes that the word can have. The word sense is disambiguated by the user via an interactive session. As a result, the proper translations can be found and used to expand the query. The drawbacks of this method are that it needs a user interaction each time the user changes a query, and it requires a sense indexed machine-readable dictionary. It is not an easy task to keep the inter-lingual sense inven-tory and to connect it with target languages. Thus, Etzioni et al. suggested an automatic sense-merging algorithm that builds inter-lingual sense indexes from normal bi-lingual dic-tionaries [3].

An automatic translation has a long history in machine translations and cross-language information retrieval. As it is focused on the translation of words instead of sentences, the problem is called lexical translation [3], translation dis-ambiguation [15], or translation selection [4]. It is usually solved by supervised or semi-supervised methods, which re-quires a bi-lingual corpus or a sense-tagged corpus [18, 10]. However, the traditional corpus-based statistical translation methods are not readily apt for tags. The statistical transla-tion is based on contexts to find the sense of the source word, but in folksonomy tagging environments, such textual con-texts are unavailable. Many images are uploaded only with tags and titles, and few have other text annotations. Be-sides, it is usually extremely expensive to build a bi-lingual or sense-tagged corpus. Thus, it is not available for most minor languages.

When such corpora are unavailable, the translation meth-ods based on the coherence can be used. A coherence is a measure for a set of words which shows how strong the words within the set are related with each other, or how much the set is likely to appear together in the target language. The methods measure the coherence of translation candidates to decide the most probable translation. The translation meth-ods based on the coherence reflect no context of the source language. Thus, an MT system can be trained only with the target language corpus. This is a strong point of the methods. At the same time, it is also their shortcoming in that they do not reflect information of the source language.
Many cross-language image retrieval systems have been proposed and evaluated in ImageCLEF sessions [16]. Sys-tems evaluated in ImageCLEF usually take one of two ap-proaches. One approach is the image analysis approach. The visual features are universal over languages. Thus, the images on users X  requests are retrieved by finding visual fea-tures from images and matching them with users X  queries. However, it is a very difficult and confusing problem to de-fine the visual features. As a result, it just works on some domains such as medical images or scenery images, and it is yet far from general-purpose image searches.

The other approach is the cross-language text retrieval with the annotated texts of images. For this, each image in ImageCLEF is annotated with several sentences that de-scribe the contents of the image. While such full sentence annotation can be a realistic environment for archived pic-tures, it is not realistic for web services. For example, in Flickr, most images are shared with only tags and titles.
Most content sharing websites are now based on folk-sonomies. The tags of a folksonomy have to converge to be useful as the indexes of contents, where the convergence implies that different users tag the similar items with a sim-ilar set of tags. Some research work has shown that they tend to converge in time [7]. This is due to the feedback from users. People learn from others X  tagging behavior and mimic them. It is also shown that the semantically meaning-ful relations can be mined from folksonomies. Mika showed Figure 1: Three Networks of tags  X  X range X ,  X  X ood X  and  X  X ear X . that synonymous tags and broad-narrow term relations can be mined from folksonomy networks [14]. Wu et al. adopted a generative method to mine synonymous terms from folk-sonomy networks [17]. Ciro et al. showed that the tag co-occurrence network built from the folksonomy indeed forms a complex network, which has features of the scale-free and  X  X mall-worldness X  of complex networks [2].
A folksonomy can be understood as a network of tags. In this network, a node represents a tag, and an edge between two tags is made when they co-occur. From this point of view, a certain tag would be expressed as a fragment of the folksonomy network in which the tag is the central node. For instance, Figure 1 shows three actual tag networks of  X  X range X ,  X  X ood X , and  X  X ear X  mined from Flickr. For clarity, only a very small number of nodes and edges are shown in these figures.

The basic assumption of tag translation is that if two tags were semantically similar, their corresponding network frag-ments would be similar. In Figure 1, the network similar-ity between  X  X range X  and  X  X ear X  will be higher than that between  X  X ood X  and  X  X ear X . The common edges or com-mon cliques are found in the network of  X  X range X  and that of  X  X ear X , but they are absent between  X  X ood X  and  X  X ear X . That is, sharing more sub-structures would result in higher network similarity.

The main problem in tag translation is that a tag word can have more than one sense. Thus, a tag network is regarded as a sum of several sub-networks. Figure 2 shows a tag network whose center is the tag  X  X pple X . The left part of this network is a sub-network in which the sense of  X  X pple X  is a fruit. On the other hand, the right part of the network represents a sub-network when it is used as a company name. This network shows both senses, and neither prevails.
Let us consider a case when another network of a new tag word is added to this. By considering a new tag, two net-works are merged into an expanded network. Figure 3 shows two expanded networks of the tag  X  X pple X . Figure 3-(a) is the network of  X  X pple X  expanded by a new word  X  X range X , and Figure 3-(b) is expanded by  X  X otebook X . The tag net-work of  X  X pple X  alone does not have any prevailing sense, but in the expanded graph, a particular sense is prevailing over the other sense. If the network of a tag is compared with these expanded networks, the sense of the tag  X  X pple X  can be determined. For instance, the tag network of  X  X ruit X  will be more similar to that of  X  X pple, orange X . On the other hand, the tag network of  X  X omputer X  will be more similar to that of  X  X pple, notebook X .

In the examples above, a tag network is compared to other tag networks in the same language, but it can be applied to the networks of a different language, as long as there is a way to compare node labels from different languages. In this fashion, the translation disambiguation is expressed as a network comparison. For example, two English tag words  X  X ood, desk X  are attached to an object. Both words have more than one sense. Suppose that an English-German dictionary look-up shows two candidates for  X  X ood X  ( Holz -wooden material, Wald -forest), and three candidates for  X  X esk X  ( Schalter -as a counter, Schreibtisch -a place for reading and writing, Tisch -a table). If one source tag is translated into one target tag, there are six candidates:  X  Holz, Schalter  X ,  X  Holz, Schreibtisch  X ,  X  Holz, Tisch  X ,  X  Wald, Schalter  X ,  X  Wald, Schreibtisch  X  and  X  Wald, Tisch  X .
By comparing the tag network of  X  X ood, desk X  one by one with tag networks of all six candidates, the most probable translation is chosen by picking up the most similar network. Therefore, this approach changes a translation problem into a network similarity issue.
The network model in this paper follows the one modeled by Mika in [14]. Mika modeled folksonomy at an abstract level as a tripartite graph with hyper-edges. The set of nodes is partitioned into the three disjoint sets A = { a 1 , . . . , a the set of actors (users), the set of concepts (tags or key-words), and the set of objects annotated. A folksonomy F is defined by a set of annotations F  X  A  X  T  X  O . This is a hyper-graph with ternary edges where an edge represents an actor associated a certain tag with a certain object 1
Three bi-partite graphs with regular edges can be made from this tri-partite graph. They are graphs between ac-tors and tags, tags and objects, and actors and objects. In this paper, the tag-object graph is adopted as a network representing tags. The original definition of the tag-object graph is one full network of all tags. Since a specific tag is expressed as a part of the whole network, it is needed to extract a fragment from the graph for the tag.
 Let W = { w 1 , . . . , w m } be tags attached to an object. For each w k  X  W , there is a tag-object matrix B k . The column of B k represents the object to which w k is attached at least once. The rows of B k are the tags which co-occur with w k including w k itself. When W 0 is a set of the tags co-occurring with w k , the tag-object matrix is expressed as B , where h
B If this binary matrix B k is considered as a graph, it is a bi-partite graph with two types of nodes. In this graph, the edges do not exist between objects nor between tags, but between objects and tags.

In order to capture the relationship among the tags, a new matrix S k is defined from this bi-partite matrix, where  X 
S of a network of which node is a tag, and the weight of an edge is the co-occurrence count between the connected tag nodes. All nodes have an edge from/to w k , but they also have other edges to the tags used for the objects to which w k is attached at least once. This is a unit network representing a tag, w
Some social web services like Flickr permit their users to add tags to any content. This enables many actors to be connected with one object.

In order to build a network that represents the tag set W , a union operation between two networks is defined as follows. Let A and B be adjacency matrices. T AB = tags ( A )  X  tags ( B ) is a set of tags from both A and B , where a function tags ( X ) returns all the tags in the adjacency matrix X . Let A 0 be an adjacency matrix expanded from A with T AB . In A , the rows and columns which do not appear in A but B are filled with 0. Then, C , which is the union of A and B , is expressed as a simple sum of two expanded matrices A 0 and B 0 . That is, Finally, a tag network for W is obtained by unifying all S
Kernel methods are popular in the machine learning com-munity with numerous applications in data mining. Early studies on kernel methods dealt only with vector-based de-scriptions of input data. Haussler [8] first defined a princi-ple way of designing kernels on structured objects, so called R-convolution kernel. Several kernels on graphs have been proposed, and they define the similarity between graphs by their common sub-structures of two graphs. The most com-monly used kernel for networks is a random-walk network kernel which uses common walks as a sub-structure [6]. A labeled graph is a graph with labels on nodes and edges. The labels are also called attributes. In tag networks, the attributes of the nodes are tag strings, and the attribute of the edges are co-occurrence counts.

Given two labeled graphs G 1 and G 2 , a random walk ker-nel counts the number of matched labeled random walks. The match between two nodes or two edges is determined by comparing their attribute values. The kernel value of two graphs is the sum of the sub-kernels for all pairs of walks within these two graphs. That is, k where k walk is a sub-kernel to compute the similarity be-tween two random walks. k walk is basically a product of all similarities between nodes and edges along the walks.
An elegant approach by G  X  artner et al. [6] for calculating all random walks within two graphs uses a direct product graph. The direct product graph of two graphs G 1 = ( V, E ) and G 2 = ( W, F ) is denoted by G 1  X  G 2 . The node set V and edge set E  X  of the direct product graph G 1  X  G 2 are given as V ( G 1  X  G 2 ) = { ( v 1 , w 1 )  X  V  X  W : label ( v 1 ) = label ( w
E  X  ( G 1  X  G 2 ) = { (( v 1 , w 1 ) , ( v 2 , w 2 ))  X  V where the label function is defined as follows.
Based on the direct product graph, the random walk ker-nel can be calculated. Let A  X  denote an adjacency matrix of the direct product G 1  X  G 2 . That is, A  X  = A ( G 1  X  G With a weighting factor  X   X  0, k graph in Equation (1) is rewritten as Originally  X  is  X  . Therefore,  X  must be chosen carefully for the convergence of the sum.

This kernel is slightly changed when it is used to measure similarities between walks that are not identically labeled [1]. In order to compare the non-identical labels, the direct product graph is changed to include all pairs of nodes and edges including non-identical labels.

Assume that the nodes are compared by a node kernel k node and the edges are compared by an edge kernel k edge . k node ( v, w ) returns the similarity between two tag words from the nodes v and w , and k edge returns the similarity between two co-occurrence counts. Then, the network ker-nel is rewritten as k walk ( walk 1 , walk 2 ) = where k
The goal of this paper is the translation of tags. Thus, the networks from different languages are compared with each other. Since the labels of edges are numeric, only labels of nodes are expressed in different languages. Therefore, a lan-guage resource is needed to compute k node in this situation. The simplest form for k node ( v, w ) is a function that returns 1 when v and w have any relations, 0 otherwise. That is, it returns 1 if w is found as a translation candidate of v in a dictionary.

The random walk kernels including the one in Equation (3) have a well-known disadvantage of tottering . That is, an artificially high similarity value can be caused by iteratively visiting the same cycle of nodes. Suppose that two networks share a common cycle. The cycle will be counted repeatedly in each step i in Equation (3). Thus, even the networks with a small cycle will have artificially high similarity than those without a cycle. To compensate this,  X  in Equation (2) is set small, since small  X  reduces the effect of longer walks.
Another solution to tottering is to remove the walks with a cycle. The detection of a cycle in a walk is difficult for general networks. However, tag networks have an interesting property which helps cycle detection. All node labels in the tag networks are unique. Thus, by keeping a signature of nodes encountered in each step, the walks with cycles can be found and removed. That is, Equation (3) is modified into k 0 walk ( walk 1 , walk 2 ) = sig ( walk 1 )  X  sig ( walk where This modified kernel is called acyclic random walk kernel in this paper.

The tag set W attached to an object is translated by com-paring it with all possible translation candidates TC ( W ) of W in the target language. Let G W be a tag network for W , and G c i be that for a translation candidate c i  X  TC ( W ). Then, the most probable translation of W , c  X  , is determined by
Let us consider an object tagged with W = { wood, desk, computer, mouse, workplace } . For the correct translation of the tags from English to German, all their translation candidates must be evaluated. Suppose that the words in W have 3, 4, 6, 2 and 3 German translation candidates respectively. Then, there would be 432 = 3  X  4  X  6  X  2  X  3 translation candidates. That is, | TC ( W ) | = 432 .
The number of translation candidates grows exponentially as the number of the tags increases, since the tags in W are simultaneously translated. When  X  is the average number of translation candidates per tag, | TC ( W ) | =  X  | W | . Therefore, it is intractable to compare G W with all possible translation candidates when | W | is large.

As a solution to this problem, the tags can be translated sequentially. In translating t i  X  W , a part of W is used in-stead of whole tags in W . For each t i ,  X  tags which co-occur most frequently with t i are chosen from W , and they are inserted into a set of W seq = { t i } . In the example above, assume that the most frequent co-occurring words of X  X ood X  are  X  X esk X ,  X  X omputer X ,  X  X orkplace X , and  X  X ouse X  in order. W seq is { wood, desk } when  X  = 1 , and it is { wood, desk, image } when  X  = 2 . For the translation of t i , the network for W seq is used instead of the network for W . This is ef-ficient but loses some contextual information. Therefore, this comparison should be used only when the number of tags attached to an object is larger. It is used only when | W | &gt; (  X  + 1) where  X  is a parameter for the number of tags to be included in W seq .
We used the MIR Flickr-2008 test set [9] for the exper-iments. It is designed for image content analysis and re-trieval. Even though it has 25,000 images sampled from Flickr, only the first 1,000 images (image number 1 to 1000) were used for the experiments. Tags of all 1,000 Flickr images were manually translated. Table 1 shows a simple statistics on the first 1,000 images of the MIR Flickr-2008. The number of total tags is 8,597, and 5,899 tags among them are unique. The average number of tags per image is 8.59, and the maximum number of tags attached to an image is 46.
The goal of the experiments is to translate English tags into German ones. In order to evaluate the proposed method, the translated tags by the proposed method are compared with manually translated tags. Due to synonyms, more than one translation among candidates can be regarded as a cor-rect answer. The answer set is prepared for each tag. For each image in the test set, both its original tags (English) and their translation candidates (German) are shown to a human translator. The translator selects one or more trans-lation candidates as proper German tags for each image. The selection of  X  X one of the above X  is also an option for the translator to indicate that none of the candidates are proper for the given tag. For instance, a tag  X  X anon X  can be attached on an image as a company name. If a dictionary contains the translation candidates only for common nouns the translator marks it with  X  X one of the above X .
Two methods are implemented as baselines. Baseline1 is the simplest method which selects the most frequent can-didate as a translation of each tag. It always selects the same candidate for each tag, regardless of co-occurring tags, and it is considered as the lower bound of tag translation. Baseline2 is a co-occurrence-based method that measures the coherence among translation candidates. It is a version of the coherence based translation method described by Gao et al. [5]. They performed noun phrase detection prior to translation selection to find the proper size of the transla-tion unit. Since the sequence of tags does not matter, unlike that of queries, the translation unit is fixed to one tag in this paper.

The tag networks needed for the proposed methods are generated from the on-line Flickr folksonomy via Flickr APIs. Both English and German tag networks are mined from Flickr.

S k , the adjacency matrix of a tag k , gets huge even with a small number of images. S k will have tens of thousands of edges even if it is made from just 1000 images, and the labels of most edges are just one or two. Thus, a method of network size reduction is needed for efficient calculation when a large number of images are engaged in S k . Although a larger network has more information than smaller ones, the edges of which labels are just one or two are not very informative. Such edges can be ignored without seriously affecting the similarity. In our experiments, the edges with the smallest label are repeatedly removed until the network reaches a desired size. After edge removal, the isolated nodes are also removed from the network. Then, the labels of the remaining edges are normalized by Jaccard-coefficients before applying network kernels.

To compute k walk in Equation (3), k node and k edge should be defined. In this paper, the Brownian bride kernel is used for k edge . It compares the edges by their weights. That is, k edge ( x, x 0 ) = max (0 , c  X  X  weight ( x )  X  weight ( x where weight ( x ) is the label of an edge x and a parameter c is set to one in our experiments.

A simple kernel based on dictionary match is used for comparing node labels. That is, k where n is the number of candidates listed in the dictionary for the translation of x . The parameter c is set to 0.6. LEO Figure 4: The accuracy change according to the net-work size. on-line English-German dictionary [12] is used as a bilin-gual dictionary for k node . The examples of English tags in the test set that are not listed in the dictionary are  X  X 40 X ,  X  X ight1 X ,  X  X reat1 X  and  X  X  hope I took this shot! X . Some of the unlisted tags are non-English words including  X  X eflexe X ,  X  X lanc i negre X , and  X  X   X  udbahnhof X .

It is an issue to select the value of  X  in Equation (2) for the convergence of random walk network kernels.  X  is set to 1 in our experiments, while  X  in Equation (2) is set to 8.
Figure 4 shows how the network size affects translation accuracy. The X -axis of this figure is the network size as number of edges, and the Y -axis is the accuracy of the pro-posed method, on the first 50 images. According to this figure, the change in network size does not affect the accu-racy drastically. The accuracy monotonically rises up to the network size of 2,000, and then it gets flat. Therefore, the network size 2,000 is used for all experiments below.
The number of tags inserted into W seq in sequential com-parison is also a parameter. That is, the optimal value of  X  in Section 4.3 should be found. To find the optimal value of  X  , 20 images with five English tags are gathered and their tags are translated into German with different values of  X  . Ta-ble 2 shows the translation accuracy and computational cost over the 20 images. The computational cost is measured as the number of times that the network kernel is called. Since each image has five English tags,  X  = 4 implies the simulta-neous translation. Computational cost grows radically with higher  X  , while the number of correct cases are nearly con-stant among  X  values higher than 2. Sequential translation with  X  = 2 is used for all experiments below.

The proposed method is compared with the manual trans-lation and two baseline methods. Table 3 shows the compar-Table 3: Accuracy comparison of various translation methods.
 Translation Method Accuracy A Accuracy B ison results. Baseline1 and Baseline2 in this table are the baseline methods explained in Section 5.1. RW  X  = n is the random walk kernel that observes walks up to length  X  = n in Equation (2). RW  X  =2 counts the walks up to length 2, RW  X  =3 counts the walks up to length 3, and so on. ARW is the acyclic random walk kernel. ARW counts the walks up to length 8. Accuracy A is calculated as CT MT , where CT is the number of correctly translated tags and MT is the number of translated tags. In translating a tag, if there is just one translation candidate for it, all methods in Table 3 give a correct answer. Thus, excluding such tags reveals the discrimination of the methods. Accuracy B is the translation accuracy over the tags with multiple translation candidates.
The accuracy of manual selection is regarded as the up-per bound since it is performed by a human translator. It is not 100%. The errors of manual selection happen when the translator decides that none of the listed candidates is correct. Most of such cases are geographic names and entity names which can be used also as a common noun like X  X anon (a company name) X  and  X  X hoenix (a city name) X . Since the dictionary used for the experiment only has translations of the common nouns for them (like kanon and ph  X  onix ), the candidate selection always fails.

Baseline1 is the lower bound but it shows fairly good per-formance in Accuracy A . It is easy to believe that the prob-lem is too simple, but this is not true. The reason why Baseline 1 seems to perform well is the large number of tag words that have just one translation candidate. Among the 3,696 tags listed in the dictionary, 965 tags have just one translation. When computing Accuracy B , these 965 tags are excluded. The Accuracy B of Baseline 1 is just 69.16% which is far lower than the kernel methods.

Another interesting point to note is that the accuracy of the random walk kernel degrades as longer walks are consid-ered. This is due to tottering . The tag network is vulnerable to the effect of tottering even in short length of walks such as length 3. This is because the average path length of the tag network is short. For example, suppose that the average path length is 2 in the tag graph. In that case, many walks of length 3 or more would have cycles, and the cycles would be common parts already observed in the previous walks. Therefore, they would act as noise against other unobserved walks of length 3 or more. In this case,  X  should be set small to ensure convergence. However, the network kernel with lower  X  would be close to just counting the number of common edges between two networks, and is not able to reflect other sub-structures.

The coherence-based method of Baseline2 works fairly well. In many cases, it selects the same candidates as the network-based method does. However, in some cases, the network-based method finds proper translation for the tags that fail in the coherence-based method. The assumption of the coherence-based method is that the proper translations would co-occur together frequently in the target language. However, some images are more richly expressed with the tags in the source language, and the co-occurrence frequen-cies among tags are not the same across different languages.
If a translation candidate does not co-occur frequently in the target language, the coherence-based method tends to ignore the candidate. Geographic names are good examples of this phenomenon. For instance, the English tags  X  X an Francisco X  and  X  X ay X  frequently co-occur since the city is located in the bay area. In German tags, their co-occurrence is rare. Therefore,  X  X ay X  can be translated into senses other than the coastal area. On the other hand, the network of  X  X an Francisco, bay X  has sub-structures like  X  X arina X  X hip X  and  X  X ea X  X ater X . Therefore, the proper translation of  X  X ay X  can be found by selecting a German candidate with similar sub-structures.

The failure of translating  X  X nderground, music, concert, live X  by Baseline2 is a different kind of example. Base-line2 chooses  X  U-bahn (subway) X  as a translation for the tag  X  X nderground X . This happens because of the different co-occurrence statistics between Flickr English tags and Ger-man tags. In English, the tag  X  X nderground X  frequently co-occurs with  X  X usic X . However, in German there are more images tagged with  X  U-bahn (subway) X  and  X  Musik (music) X  than those tagged with  X  Untergrund (underground) X  and  X  Musik (music) X . Therefore, the coherence-based method results in a wrong translation  X  U-bahn , Musik  X  for  X  X nder-ground, music X .

On the other hand, in the network-based method, a strong connection is established between the English networks of  X  X usic X  and  X  X nderground X , while very few sub-structures are shared between the English tags  X  X usic X  and  X (a sense of) subway X . Thus, the similarity of  X  Untergrund , Musik  X  is far higher than that of  X  U-bahn , Musik  X .

Acyclic random walk kernel ( ARW ) outperforms all other methods used in the experiments. By removing cycles from walks, the method reflects long walks without tottering. It reports nearly 3% higher accuracy than random walk kernels RW  X  = n and 5.1% higher than the coherence-based method ( Baseline 2).
In this paper, we have proposed a novel method of lexical translation in cross-language image retrieval. The proposed method translates the annotated tags instead of queries us-ing additional information, the folksonomy network. Since the tags are expressed as a network using the folksonomy, their translation is formulated as network comparisons. That is, the selection of the most probable translation candidate is transformed into finding the most similar network, and a network kernel is adopted for the network similarity.
The experiments on the MIR Flickr test set showed that the proposed method outperforms a baseline method of co-herence-based translation. The accuracy achieved by the proposed method is high enough to be used in practical cross-language image retrieval. The main reason why the proposed method outperforms the coherence-based method is that it uses additionally the contextual information of the source language given as tag networks.

The advantage of the proposed method is that it is well suited for translating multimedia content tags where only a few textual contexts are available other than the tags. The only language resource needed for the method is a bilingual dictionary. Thus, it can be readily applied to minor lan-guages without reliable language resources.
 Our future work will be to speed up the proposed method. Translating the tags on-line is important for tag translators to be used in the interactive cross-language retrieval of mul-timedia information. However, the time complexity of the network kernels is too high to be used in real-time envi-ronments. Therefore, our efforts will focus on reducing the computational time of the proposed method.
