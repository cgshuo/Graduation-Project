 Logic-based Information Retrieval (IR) models represent the retrieval decision as a logical implication d  X  q between a document d and a query q ,where d and q are logical sen-tences. However, d  X  q is a binary decision, we thus need a measure to estimate the degree to which d implies q , denoted P ( d  X  q ). In this study, we revisit the Van Rijsbergen X  X  as-sumptions [16] about: 1-the logical implication  X   X   X  X snot the material one  X   X   X , and 2-P ( d  X  q ) could be estimated by the conditional probability P ( q | d ). More precisely, we claim that the material implication is an appropriate impli-cation for IR, and also we mathematically prove that replac-ing P ( d  X  q )by P ( q | d ) is a correct choice. In order to prove the Van Rijsbergen X  X  assumption, we use the Propositional Logic and the Lattice theory. We also exploit the notion of degree of implication that is proposed by Knuth [7]. H.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Information Retrieval, Propositional Logic, Lattice Many studies [16, 11, 3, 10, 4, 9] showed that Information Retrieval (IR) can be represented as a logical implication d  X  q ,where d represents a document and it is a logical sentence in a specific logic, and q represents a query and it is also a logical sentence in the same logic of d .
Using the logical implication d  X  q for representing the retrieval decision is quite limited, because d  X  q is a bi-nary decision, i.e. either d implies q or not. However, IR is an uncertain process [3], because: 1-q is an imperfect representation of user needs, 2-d is also an imperfect rep-resentation of the content of documents, and 3-relevance judgement depends on external factors, e.g. the user. We thus need a more flexible notion of implication between d and q for reflecting this uncertainty . We need to estimate the degree of implication or the uncertainty of implication, denoted P ( d  X  q ).

We mainly focus, in this paper, on Van Rijsbergen X  X  study [16]. Van Rijsbergen presented a special logical framework, namely Conditional Logic , and he claimed that the appro-priate implication for representing the retrieval decision is a type of logical implication d  X  q different from the material implication d  X  q .

According to Van Rijsbergen [16], the implication d  X  q is formalised as follows:  X  if d is true then q  X . He also assumed that the uncertainty could be estimated by the conditional probability: Van Rijsbergen X  X  assumption about estimating P ( d  X  q ) depending on P ( q | d ) was intuitive.

In this study, we discuss and claim that the retrieval de-cision could be modeled by the material implication d  X  q , and then we propose a proof for Van Rijsbergen X  X  assump-tion.

We choose the Propositional Logic (PL) as the underling logical framework to represent documents, queries, and the retrieval decision. It is known that PL corresponds to a lat-tice [6]. Moreover, Knuth [7] defined a degree of implication or inclusion on lattices. It is then possible to exploit the lattice structure and Knuth X  X  notion of the degree of impli-cation for estimating P ( d  X  q ).

The paper is structured as follows: in section 2, we give a brief survey about the different types of logics that are used for building logic-based IR models. We also present some of the techniques that are used for estimating the uncertainty of a logical implication. We mainly discuss, in section 3, the validity of our hypothesis about replacing the logical implication d  X  q by the material one d  X  q .I nsection 4, we present a proof for the Van Rijsbergen X  X  assumption, which concerns estimating P ( d  X  q ) using the conditional probability P ( q | d ). We conclude in section 5. The appendix A reviews the mathematical basics that are necessary to understand the mathematics of the paper.
Logic-based IR models state that d and q are logical sen-tences in a specific logic. In addition, d should be retrieved iff it logically implies q , denoted d  X  q 1 . Sebastiani [15]
For more information about the mathematical notions used in the rest of this paper, please refer to Appendix A. reviews the different stands of what d  X  q actually means in IR field. He illustrates that there are five different stands presented in IR literatures: 1-d  X  q istrueinsomepar-ticular interpretations, denoted M | = d  X  q where M is a subset of interpretations, 2-q is a logical consequence of d , denoted M d | = q where M d is the set of models of d ,3-d is valid, denoted | = d  X  q ,4-q is provable from d , denoted d q ,and5-d  X  q is a theorem, denoted d  X  q .Itisalso possible to add one more stand, 6-d  X  q is provable from a pre-defined set of sentences F , denoted F d  X  q .Points 1, 2, and 3 are model-theoretic notions, whereas, points 4, 5, and 6 are proof-theoretic notions.

The most general definition of the logical implication d  X  q was formalized as a condition of the form:  X  if d is true then q  X  [16, 3]. However, there are some studies that trans-lated d  X  q into different forms, e.g. Conceptual Graph ordering [2], concept subsumption [10, 14]. Van Rijsbergen [16] formalized the implication  X   X   X , as follows: for any two sentences or sets of sentences X and Y , X  X  Y means that  X  if X is true then Y  X . In other words, if both X and Y are true under an interpretation then X  X  Y is also true under that interpretation. The truth of X  X  Y does not simply depend on the evaluation of X and Y in one interpretation. Chiaramella et al. [3], by their turn, formalized the implica-tion  X   X   X , as follows: D  X  Q is true iff Q is true given that D is true. Both [16, 3] are compatible with stand 4 [15].
In general, IR is an uncertain process [3], so we need to evaluate the uncertainty of d  X  q . Van Rijsbergen [16] and Nie [11] depend on the Possible Worlds semantic to evaluate the uncertainty of an implication P ( d  X  q ). More precisely, according to Van Rijsbergen [16], the P ( d  X  q )couldbe replaced by the conditional probability P ( q | d ), whereas, Nie [11] depends on the notion of distance between the possible worlds over the path from d to q .

The assumption of Van Rijsbergen [16] about estimating the logical implication uncertainty P ( d  X  q ) using the con-ditional probability P ( q | d ), is the most general form of un-certainty estimation and it is well accepted by the IR com-munity. However, this assumption has no rigid theoretical proof, and in this study, we present, for the first time to our knowledge, a theoretical proof for Van Rijsbergen X  X  assump-tion.

All studies that talked about representing the retrieval de-cision by a logical implication d  X  q , also presented some methods to estimate the uncertainty P ( d  X  q ). Most of proposals for estimating the value of P ( d  X  q )arecomplex, e.g. Conceptual Graph projection, Possible Worlds seman-tic. However, there were a few studies, e.g. [9, 1], presented practical and simple algorithms. Concerning the type of logic, a wide range of logics have been used to represent d , q , and consequently d  X  q .

Nie [ 12, 13] uses the Modal Logic , and he uses the notion of Possible Worlds and the relations between them for es-timating P ( d  X  q ). In [13], he also uses the probability besides possible worlds for estimating P ( d  X  q ).
Meghini et al. [10] and Sebastiani [14] use the Descrip-tion Logic , and they use the notion of possible worlds and the denotational semantic of description logic beside the proba-bility for estimating P ( d  X  q ).

Crestani et al. [5] also use the Modal Logic , but they use the Logical Imaging technique, which is probability depen-dent, for estimating P ( d  X  q ).

Chevallet et al. [2] use the First-Order Logic , represented by Conceptual Graph , for representing d , q ,and d  X  q . They also use the notion of conceptual graph projection for estimating P ( d  X  q ).

Losada et al. [9] and Abdulahhad et al. [1] use the Propo-sitional Logic , and they use the notion of model intersection for estimating P ( d  X  q ).

The choice of the appropriate logic depends on its ex-pressive power and the complexity of its deduction algo-rithms, where there is a trade-off between the expressive power and deduction algorithm complexity. For a more com-plete picture about the type of logic and the way of estimat-ing P ( d  X  q ) refers to [8, 4].
In this study, we use the Propositional Logic PL as un-derlying logic. Therefore, any logical sentence s is a logical sentence under PL, and it is built depending on a set of atomic propositions. The set of atomic propositions is the set of indexing terms. In other words, every term t is an atomic proposition, and t is true for a specific document d means that t indexes d ,orequivalently, d is about t [15]. Documents and queries are logical sentences built depending on terms.

All studies [16, 11, 3, 8, 9] claim that the implication  X   X   X  is different from the classic material implication  X   X   X . In addition,  X   X   X  is more appropriate than  X   X   X  X orIR.Inthis paper, we claim that the two implications  X   X   X  X nd X   X   X  X re equivalent for IR.

All definitions of the implication d  X  q , depicted in [16, 11, 3, 9], agree that d  X  q can only be evaluated in the interpretations where the antecedent d is true and in those interpretations if the consequent q is also true then d  X  is true. In other words, the evaluation space for d  X  q is restricted to the interpretations that make d true, whereas the evaluation space of d  X  q contains all possible interpre-tations.

The main problem in those studies was the inability to imagine the meaning of d  X  q when d is false, where d represents a document and q represents a query. However, the impossibility of imagining some thing is not a sufficient reason for not modeling that thing. In other words, d  X  q when d is false is a part of the model even if this case is not an existing case.

First of all, we should clarify what  X  d is false  X  actually means. To discuss  X  d is false  X , we have two cases: From the previous discussion, it is possible to say that the cases where d is false are not existing cases. Therefore, even if we integrate them in our model that will not change any thing because we do not face these cases in real IR systems.
We explained why the cases where  X  d is false X  are not ex-isting. However, the main goal of IR systems is to check the validity of | = d  X  q , rather than studying the exact defini-tion of the implication d  X  q . In the rest of this section, we present a mathematical proof showing that d  X  q is a special case of d  X  q . We can discuss our assumption about replacing d  X  q by d  X  q in a more formal way, as follows:
From the traditional truth table, the material implication d  X  q is true, when, either d and q are true, or d is false. Therefore, the set of models of d  X  q is M d  X  q : where M d | = d is the set of models of d , M q | = q is the set of models of q ,and M d = I \ M d is the set of interpretations that make d false.

According to the definition of d  X  q , which is presented in [16, 3], d  X  q is true under a specific interpretation iff d and q are true under that interpretation. Thus, the set of models of d  X  q is M d  X  q : From equations 2 and 3, we can see that d  X  q is a special case of d  X  q .
 Point 2: ( | = d  X  q )vs.( | = d  X  q ).

From the definition of d  X  q , we know that:
The implication d  X  q is also equivalent to the set inclu-sion between models: That is correct because:
From Point 1 and Point 2 , we can see that: On the one hand, d  X  q is a special case of d  X  q . On the other hand, we showed that the cases when d is false M d are not existing cases. Therefore, it is possible to assume that d  X  q and d  X  q are equivalent in IR field. Actually, the goal of IR systems is to check if d  X  q is true or not, or in other words, to check the validity of M d  X  M q .

Depending on the previous discussion, it is possible to re-place d  X  q by d  X  q for modeling the retrieval decision. In the next section, we illustrate how P ( d  X  q ), or equivalently P ( d  X  q ), can be replaced by P ( q | d ), which corresponds the Van Rijsbergen X  X  assumption [16].

After the previous discussion our main hypothesis is: the material implication d  X  q is an appropriate implication for modeling the retrieval decision . Henceforth, we will use the two implications d  X  q and d  X  q interchangeably.
As we mentioned, modeling the retrieval decision as an implication d  X  q is quite limited, because d  X  q is a bi-nary decision ( T or F ). Therefore, we need a metric for estimating the degree of implication between d and q ,de-noted P ( d  X  q ).

If d and q are two logical sentences then they correspond to two distinct nodes M d and M q in B M ,where B M is the lattice of models (Appendix A). B M is built depending on the power set of the set of interpretations, not depending on the set of interpretations. We also know that B M is a Boolean algebra, so for any two nodes M 1 and M 2 in B M , the z ( M 1 ,M 2 ) function (equation 8) is the conditional prob-ability P ( M 1 | M 2 ) (equation 9).

On the one hand, it is possible to replace P ( d  X  q )by z ( M q ,M d ), because: Therefore, P ( d  X  q )= P ( M q | M d ). On the other hand, we know that each node M  X  2 ( 2 A ) in the Boolean algebra B represents a set of models of a set of logically-equivalent sen-tences. By this way, M q is a set of models of a set of logical sentences equivalent to q .Wechoose q as a representative to this equivalent class. We do the same thing for d . Therefore, Equation (6) justifies the definition of P ( d  X  q )thatis presented by Van Rijsbergen [16]. To our knowledge, this is the first study that presents a formal justification of the Van Rijsbergen X  X  assumption.
This study presents a new vision of logic-based IR mod-els through exploiting the implicit link between lattices and Propositional Logic.

We use the Propositional Logic for representing docu-ments and queries, and then we claim that the retrieval decision corresponds to the material implication between a document and a query. After that, we position documents and queries on a lattice, more precisely on a Boolean algebra. We then exploit the degree of implication metric z , defined on the lattice, for representing the ranking mechanism.
Our model provides a theoretical proof for the definition of P ( d  X  q ) that is presented by Van Rijsbergen [16]. To our knowledge, this is the first study that mathematically proves the Van Rijsbergen X  X  assumption about replacing P ( d  X  q ) by P ( q | d ).

The next step of this study will be to exploit the potential capabilities of Propositional Logic and the Lattice theory in order to build a new, general, and practical IR model.

This study depends on Propositional Logic (PL) as a theo-retical and mathematical basis. Therefore, when saying that s is a logical sentence, we implicitly mean that s is a logical sentence under PL.

We define A = { a 1 ,...,a n } as a set of all atomic propo-sitions. The set A forms our alphabet, and it is a finite set |
A | = n . Any proposition a i  X  A can take only one of two possible values: True T ,orFalse F .
 We say that a sentence s is provable from a set of sentences F , denoted F s ,when s can be obtained by applying infer-ence rules to the axioms of the logic and the set of sentences F .Moreover, s means that s can be obtained by applying inference rules to the axioms of the logic.

In PL, a semantic is given to a logical sentence s by assign-ing a truth value ( T or F ) to each atomic proposition in s . In this manner, each logical sentence s has several interpre-tations depending on the truth value of its propositions. The subset M s of interpretations that makes s true is called the set of models of s , denoted M s | = s .Moreover, | = s means that s is a tautology or it is true in all interpretations, and | = s means that s is false in all interpretations. According to this formalism, we define any model m  X  M s of s as a set of atomic propositions that have T as truth value[9]. In this manner, M s  X  2 ( 2 A ) ,where2 x is the power set of the set x . In addition, for any two sentences s 1 and s 2 , | =( s 1 equivalent to M s 1  X  M s 2 ,where  X  is the material implica-tion. The two symbols and | = are metalanguage symbols and they are not part of the logic.

In any lattice ( L,  X  ,  X  ) and for any two elements x, y even that x does not include y , it is possible to describe the degree to which x includes y . Knuth [7] generalizes the inclu-sion to the degree of inclusion represented by real numbers. He introduced the z function :  X  x, y  X  L, z ( x, y )= where z ( x, y ) quantifies the degree to which x includes y . Knuth [7] says:  X  X he motivation here is that, if we are cer-tain that x includes y then we want to indicate this knowl-edge. However, if we know that x does not include y ,then we can quantify the degree to which x includes y  X .
The z function is simply the probability when it is defined on a Boolean algebra ( L,  X  ,  X  ,  X  , ,  X  )[7]: where P is a probability function.
