One traditional approach in this area is to use gossip-based algorithms, which are typi-cally simple, scalable, and e ffi cient. Besides the sim-plest applications, such as computing the average of a set of numbers ( Kempe et al. , 2003 ; Jelasity et al. , 2005 ; Xiao et al. , 2007 ), this approach can be used to compute global models of fully distributed data. To name a few, Expectation-Maximization for Gaussian Mixture learning ( Kowalczyk &amp; Vlassis , 2005 ), lin-ear Support Vector Machines ( Orm  X andi et al. , 2012 ), and boosting ( Heged  X us et al. , 2012 ) were adapted to this architecture. The goal of this paper is to pro-pose a gossip-based stochastic multi-armed bandit algorithm. 1.1. Multi-armed bandits Multi-armed bandits tackle an iterative decision making problem where an agent chooses one of the K previously fixed arms in each round t , and then it receives a random reward that depends on the chosen arm. The goal of the agent is to optimize some evaluation metric such as the error rate (the expected percentage of playing a suboptimal arm) or the cumulative regret (the expected di ff erence of the sum of the obtained rewards and the sum of the rewards that could have been obtained by se-lecting the best arm in each round). In the stochas-tic multi-armed bandit setup, the distributions can vary with the arms but do not change with time. To achieve the desired goal, the agent has to trade o ff using arms found to be good based on earlier plays (exploitation) and trying arms that have not been tested enough times (exploration) ( Auer et al. , 2002 ; According to a result by Lai &amp; Robbins ( 1985 ), no al-gorithm can have an error rate o (1 /t ). One can thus consider policies with error rate O (1 /t ) to be asymp-totically optimal. An example of such a method is the -greedy algorithm of Auer et al. ( 2002 ). Multi-armed bandit algorithms have generated sig-nificant theoretical interest, and they have been ap-plied to many real applications. Some of these de-cision problems are clearly relevant in a distributed context. Consider, for example, a fully decentralized recommendation system, where we wish to recom-mend content based on user feedback without run-ning through a central server (e.g., for privacy rea-sons). Another example is real-time tra ffi c planning using a decentralized sensor network in which agents try to optimize a route in a common environment. Our algorithm is probably not applicable per se to these settings (in the first example, contextual ban-dits ( Langford &amp; Zhang , 2007 ) are arguably more adequate, and in the second example the environ-ment is non-stationary and the agents might be ad-first step in developing theoretically sound and prac-tically feasible solutions to problems of this kind. 1.2. P2P networks A P2P network consists of a large collection of nodes (peers) that communicate with each other directly without any central control. We assume that each node has a unique address. The communication is based on message passing. Each node can send mes-sages to any other node assuming that the address of the target node is available locally. This  X  X nows about X  relation defines an overlay network that is used for communication.
 In this paper two types of overlay networks are con-sidered. In the theoretical analysis (Sections 2 and 3 ) we will use the PerfectOverlay protocol in which each node is connected to exactly two dis-tinct neighbors, which means that the communica-tion graph is the union of disjunct circles. Within this class, the neighbor assignment is uniform ran-dom, and it changes in each communication round. This protocol has no known practical decentralized implementation, so in our experiments (Section 5 ) we use the practically feasible Newscast protocol of Jelasity et al. ( 2007 ). In this protocol each node sends messages to two distinct nodes selected ran-domly in each round. The main di ff erence between the two protocols is that in PerfectOverlay each node receives exactly two messages in each round whereas in Newscast the number of received mes-sages by any node follows a Poisson distribution with parameter 2 (when N is large). 1.3. P2P stochastic bandits and our results In our P2P bandit setup, we assume that each of the N peers has access to the same set of K arms (with the same unknown distributions that does not change with time X  X ence the setting is stochastic), and in every round each peer pulls one arm inde-pendently. We also assume that on each peer, an individual instance of the same bandit algorithm is run. The peers can communicate with each other by sending messages in each round exclusively along the links of the applied overlay network. In this paper we adapt the stochastic -greedy bandit algorithm 1 of Auer et al. ( 2002 ) to such an architecture. Our main theoretical goal is to assess the achiev-able speedup as a function of N . First, note that after T rounds of arm-pulling and communicating, the number of total plays is NT so (recalling the bound by Lai &amp; Robbins 1985 ) the order of mag-nitude of the best possible error rate is 1 / ( NT ). In Section 3 , we show that our algorithm achieves error rate O (1 / ( d 2 Nt )) for a number of rounds T =  X  (log N ), where d is a lower bound on the gap between the expected reward on i  X  and any sub-optimal arm. Consequently, the regret is also of the order O log( NT ) /d 2 + N min( t, log N ) , where N min( t, log N ) is essentially the cost of spreading experiments (Section 5 ) also show that our algorithm scales gracefully with the size of the network, giving further support to our theoretical results. 1.4. Related research Gelly et al. ( 2008 ) addresses the exploration-exploitation dilemma within a distributed set-ting. They introduce a heuristic for a multi-core parallelization of the UCT algorithm ( Kocsis &amp; Szepesv  X ari , 2006 ). Note, however, that multi-core parallelization is simpler than tackling fully dis-tributed environments. The reason is that in the multi-core architectures, the individual computa-tional units have access to a shared memory making 2 information exchange cheap, quick, and easy. The large data flow generated by a potentially complete information exchange in a fully distributed environ-ment is clearly not feasible in real-life applications. Awerbuch &amp; Kleinberg ( 2008 ) consider a problem where a network of individuals face a sequential de-cision problem: in each round they have to choose an action (for example, a restaurant for dinner), then they receive a reward based on their choice (how much they liked the place). The individuals can also communicate with each other, making it possible to reduce the regret by sharing their opinions. This dis-tributed recommendation system can be interpreted as a multi-armed bandit problem in a distributed network, just like ours, but with three significant di ff erences. The first is that they consider the ad-versarial setting (that is, in contrast to our stochas-tic setting, the distributions of the arms can change with time). The second is that their bound on the regret is O ((1 + K/N )(log N ) T 2 / 3 log T ) per indi-vidual, and thus the total regret over the whole net-work of individuals is O (( N + K )(log N ) T 2 / 3 log T This is linear in the number of peers, contrary to our logarithmic dependence. Finally, they allow for a communication phase of log N rounds between the consecutive arm pulling, which makes the problem much easier than in our setup.
 Both the fact that peers act in parallel, and that we introduce a delay between pulling the arms re-lates our approach to setups with delayed feedback ( Joulani , 2012 ). (Similar, but not bandit problem is considered by ( Langford et al. , 2009 )) In this model, in round t , for each arm i a random value  X  i,t is drawn, and the reward for pulling arm i is received in round t +  X  i,t . However, the regret bounds in Joulani ( 2012 ) grow linearly in the length of the ex-pected delay, which is unusable in our setup where the delay grows exponentially with T .
 Our algorithm shows some superficial resemblance with the Epoch-greedy algorithm introduced by Langford &amp; Zhang ( 2007 ). Epoch-greedy is also based on the -greedy algorithm and, just like ours, it updates the arm selection rule based on new in-formation only at the end of the epochs. However, besides these similarities the two algorithms are very di ff erent, and provide solutions to completely di ff erent problems. In epoch-greedy the original epsilon-greedy algorithm is modified in several cru-cial points, of which the most important is that they decouple the exploration and exploitation steps: ex-ploration is only done in the last round of the epochs. This is favorable in that specific contextual bandit setting they work with, but would be harmful in our setup, since it would generate too large regret. Finally, it should be stressed that our main contri-bution is the general approach to adapt -greedy to decentralized architectures with limited communica-tion, such as P2P networks. It is not clear though how to do this with other algorithms. In this section, we present our algorithm. Let N, K  X  N + denote the number of peers and the num-ber of arms, respectively. For the easier analysis we assume that N is a power of 2, that is N =2 m for some m  X  N . Throughout the description of our al-gorithm and its analysis, we use the PerfectOver-lay protocol which means that each peer sends mes-sages to two other peers and receives messages from the same two peers in each round.
 Arms, peers, and rounds will be indexed by i = 1 ,...,K , j, j =1 ,...,N , and t, t =1 ,...,T ,re-tribution for arm i . The indicator I i j pulls arm i in round t , and 0 otherwise. The immediate reward observed by peer j in round t is  X  j,t . In the standard setup, if all rewards were communicated immediately to all peers,  X  i would be estimated in round t by  X   X  i s and n i arm i was pulled. Using the PerfectOverlay protocol, each peer j sends its s and n estimates to its two neighbors, peer j 1 and j 2 , 3 then peer j updates its estimates by averaging the estimates of its neighbors. Formally, in each round t , the esti-mates at each peer j can be expressed as weighted sums s i fined recursively as It is then obvious that for t&gt; 1, s i Once we have an estimate  X   X  i 3 dard -greedy policy of Auer et al. ( 2002 ) is to choose the optimal arm (arm i for which  X   X  i imal) with probability 1  X  t , and a random arm with probability t , with t converging to 0 at a speed of 1 /t . The problem with this strategy in the P2P en-vironment is that rewards received in recent rounds do not have time to spread, making the standard s use rewards  X  j,t immediately after time t , rather we collect them in auxiliary variables and work them into the estimates only after a delay that grows exponentially with time. For the formal descrip-tion, let s i and n i T ( ger power of 2 which is less then of t ). With this notation, the reward estimate of P2P--greedy is where c i n tation of the algorithm would be to communicate the weight matrix w j ,t bors in each round t , and to compute  X   X  i ing to ( 3 ) and ( 1 ). This would, however, imply a linear communication cost in terms of the num-ber of rounds t . It turns out that it is su ffi cient to send six vectors of size K to each neighbor to com-pute ( 3 ). Indeed, the quantities a i b q updated by each time when t is an integer power of 2, and by a in every round t . In addition, in each iteration t , pre-ceeding ( 5 ) and ( 4 ), all the six vectors are updated by aggregating the neighbors, similarly to ( 2 ). The intuitive rationale of the procedure is the fol-lowing. A run is divided into epochs: the -th epoch starts in round t =2 and ends in round t =2 +1  X  1. During the th epoch, the rewards  X  j,t are collected in the vector a j,t =[ a i At the end of the epoch, they are copied into r and q respectively. The rewards and the counts are fi-nally copied into c and d , respectively, at the end of epoch ( + 1). In other words, a reward obtained in iteration t will not be used to estimate the expected dure allows the rewards to  X  X pread X  in the network for a certain time before being used to estimate te expected reward, which makes is possible to formally control the bias of the estimates.
 The pseudocode of P2P--greedy is summarized in Algorithm 1 . Formally, a model M is a 6-tuple ( c , d , r , q , a , b ) where each component is a vector in R K . Peer j requests models M j its two neighbors j 1 and j 2 (Line 1 ), aggregates them into a new model M j,t (Line 3 ), chooses an arm i j,t based on M j,t (Lines 7  X  8 ), and then updates M j,t based on the obtained reward (Line 10 ). When j is asked for send a model, it sends its updated M j,t +1 . Before stating the main theorem, we introduce some additional notations. The index of the unique op- X  i =  X  i  X   X   X  i . We assume (as Auer et al. 2002 ) that there exist a lower bound d on the di ff erence between  X   X  best arm, that is,  X  d :0 &lt;d  X  min i = i  X   X  i . Our main result is the following.
 Theorem 1. Consider a P2P network of N peers with a PerfectOverlay protocol. Assume that the same K arms are available at each peer and that the rewards come from [0 , 1] . Then, for any c&gt; 0 , the probability of selecting a suboptimal arm i = i  X  at any peer by P2P--greedy after t  X  cK/ ( d 2 N ) iterations is at most The first three terms of ( 6 ) correspond to the bound given by Auer et al. ( 2002 ) for their version of the -greedy algorithm. The last term corresponds to the P2P overhead: it results from the imperfect informa-tion of a peer about the rewards received throughout the network. This last term decays exponentially and it becomes insignificant after O (log N ) rounds. The following corollary is a reformulation of The-orem 1 in terms of the regret. Stochastic bandit algorithms are usually evaluated in terms of the ex-pected regret R t = i is pulled up to round t . In our P2P setup, an arm is pulled in each round t and at each peer j , so we 4 Algorithm 1 P2P--greedy at peer j in iteration t 4: if t =1 then 5: Let i j,t = j mod K Initial (arbitrary) arm-selection 6: else 7: With probability 1  X  t let i j,t = arg max { c i j,t /d :1  X  i  X  K, d i 9: Pull arm i j,t and receive reward  X  j,t 10: The model to be sent is M j,t +1 = UPDATE ( M j,t ,  X  11: function AGGREGATE( M =( c , d , r , q , a , b ) , M =( c , d , r , q , a , b )) 13: r =(1 / 2)( r + r ), q =(1 / 2)( q + q ) 14: a =(1 / 2)( a + a ), b =(1 / 2)( b + b ) 15: return M =( c , d , r , q , a , b ) 17: if t is an integer power of 2 then 18: c = c + r , d = d + q , r = a , q = b , a = b = 0 19: a i = a i + N  X  , b i = b i + N 20: return M are interested in upper bounding the sum of the ex-pected regrets incurred at each peer where P [ i j,t = i ]= P I i that peer j pulls arm i in round t . Since the last term of ( 6 ) becomes close to 0 only after O (log N ) rounds, we will not bound the total regret starting at round zero, rather starting at round  X  t ( N )= O (log N ). This implies that the total regret will be increased by a O ( N log N ) term, as explained in Section 1.3 . Corollary 2. Let R t ( 7 ) denote the expected re-gret for the whole network after t iterations in the P2P--greedy algorithm. Then R t  X  R  X  t ( N ) = O log( Nt ) /d 2 for some  X  t ( N )= O (log N ) . We start the analysis by investigating c j,t in a par-ticular peer j . For any arm 1  X  i  X  K and any peer 1  X  j  X  N , each component of c j,t can be rewritten as the weighted sum of individual rewards received up to iteration T ( t/ 2)  X  1, and then decomposed as c The following lemma states some important proper-ties of the weights.
 Lemma 3. For any rounds t and t  X  t , and any peer j , the weights of the reward  X  j ,t in round t sum up to N : N any t&gt;t , the weight w j ,t is independent of j and  X  j ,t , and the distribution of w Proof. The first statement follows trivially from the definition of the weights ( 1 ). The independence of the weights of the peer indices and of the rewards is true since the random assignments of neighbors of the PerfectOverlay protocol is independent of the bandit game.
 The following lemma can be thought of as bound-ing the  X  X orizontal variance X : focusing on just one specific reward  X  j ,t , it bounds the variance of its 5 in a given iteration t .
 Lemma 4. For any t  X  1 , t&gt;t , and 1  X  j  X  N , we have E N thermore, E j ( w j ,t Proof. The proof of the first statement follows Kempe et al. ( 2003 ) and Jelasity et al. ( 2005 ) and it is included in the supplementary material. The last claim is true because the distributions of w j ,t j =1 ,...,N , are identical (Lemma 3 ).
 Using Lemma 4 we can now bound the variance of the first term on the right hand side in ( 8 ), and the variance of the first term of a similar decomposition of d i j,t . We start with the latter.
 Lemma 5. For any t  X  1 , any 1  X  j  X  N , and any 1  X  i  X  K , the random variable y i variance of at most 12 N 3 2  X  t/ 2 .
 Proof. The zero mean is a consequence of Lemma 3 . For the variance, we have Var y i where ( 9 ) follows from Lemma 4 and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
 Lemma 6. For any t  X  1 , any 1  X  j  X  N , and any 1  X  i  X  K , the random variable z i and variance of at most Var z i Proof. The first step is to exploit the fact that  X  j,t  X  [0 , 1]. Then the proof is analogous to the proof of Lemma 5 .
 Proof. of Theorem 1 (sketch) We first control the first term (A) in ( 8 ) by analyzing a version of -greedy where N independent plays are allowed per iteration. We follow closely the analysis of -greedy of Auer et al. ( 2002 ) with some trivial mod-ifications. Then in (B) we relate this to P2P--greedy and show that the di ff erence is negligible. Assume that t  X  cK/ ( d 2 N ), let j = cK/ ( d 2 jN ), and let x 0 = N ing some arm i in round t at peer j is be decomposed as Now let C i and D i bound, we bound the first term of ( 10 )by We can upper bound T 1 following Auer et al. ( 2002 ). To upper bound T 2 recall that, by Lemma 6 , c has expected value E z i Var z i inequality for z i T 3 and T 4 can be upper bounded the same way using Lemma 5 , so T 2 + T 3 + T 4  X  2304 second term of ( 10 ) can be upper bounded following the same steps. The proof can then be completed by a slight modification of the original proof of Auer et al. ( 2002 ) (see the supplementary material). In P2P--greedy , each peer sends its model to two other peers, inducing a network-wise communication 6 cost of O ( NK ). This is impractical when K is large (e.g., K  X  N ). In this section we present a practi-cal algorithm with O ( N ) communication cost. The main idea is that each peer sends and receives mod-els about only one arm in each round. We have no formal proof about the convergence of the algo-rithm, but in experiments (Section 5 ) we found that it worked almost as well as P2P--greedy .
 In P2P--greedy.slim , the model becomes M = ( the arm M stores information about, and c, d, r, q, a and b are scalar values corresponding to the vector variables in P2P--greedy . In each iteration, peer j has its current model M corresponding to arm i , and it receives two models M 1 and M 2 correspond-ing to arms i 1 and i 2 . Then it proceeds as follows. (For complete pseudocode see Section D .) 1. If i 1 = i 2 , then let M = M 1 if c 1 /d 1 &gt;c 2 /d 2. If i 1 = i 2 , then let M the result of the aggre-3. If i = i , then let M = M (replace the current 4. If i = i , then let M be the better (with the 5. Pull the arm i corresponding to the new model In the first experiments, we verified our theoreti-cal results in experiments on synthetic data. Our first goal was to verify the main claim of the paper, namely that the -greedy algorithm can achieve logarithmic regret after  X  (log N ) iterations in a P2P. Our second goal was to give empirical support to our epoch-based technique. We compared the per-formance of -greedy , P2P--greedy , and a sim-plified version of the P2P--greedy which only ag-gregates the models in each iteration and works the rewards into the mean estimates ( c j,t / d j,t ) immedi-ately. We will refer to this simplified P2P algorithm as P2P--Gr-merge . Although our regret analy-sis was carried out by assuming PerfectOverlay protocol, we also tested the P2P algorithms using the Newscast protocol. We used P2P networks with various sizes: N = 10 , 100 , 1000. We compared the performances of the algorithms in terms of their regret and their accuracy (rate of plays on which the best arm is selected). The test problem consisted of 7 K = 10 arms with Bernoulli distributions whose pa-cordingly, we set the parameter d to 0 . 07 &lt; min i  X  i The only hyperparameter of the -greedy methods is set to c =0 . 1. The performance measures (regret and accuracy) of the algorithms are plotted against number of plays in Figure 1 . The results show av-erages over 10 repetitions of the simulation. We remark that the P2P adaptations of -greedy algo-rithm pulls N arms in each iteration, thus the curves concerning to P2P algorithms start at the N th play. The plots show that, first, the performance of P2P--greedy scales gracefully with respect to the num-ber of peers and its regret grows at the same speed as that of -greedy in accordance with our main result (Corollary 2 ). Furthermore, their regrets are also on a par with respect to the number of plays. Sec-ond, P2P--Gr-merge converges slower than P2P--greedy which confirms empirically the need to de-performance of P2P--greedy does not deteriorate significantly with the Newscast protocol, which is an important experimental results from a practical point of view. Finally, note that the significant leap in the regret when N = 1000 is due to the N log N In the second experiment, we compared the perfor-mance of P2P--greedy.slim and P2P--greedy using the same stochastic bandit setup as in the first experiment. We used Newscast in the test runs. Both algorithms were run with the same parame-ters ( c =0 . 1 ,d =0 . 07) using P2P networks of sizes N = 10 , 100 , 1000. Figure 2 shows the regret and ac-curacy against number of plays. The results are av-eraged over 10 repetitions of the simulation. P2P--greedy.slim is slightly worse than P2P--greedy but asymptotically it performs comparably for a K times smaller communication cost. In this paper, we adapted the -greedy stochastic bandit algorithm to P2P architecture. We showed that P2P. -greedy preserves the asymptotic be-havior of its standalone version, that is, the regret bound is O ( tN ) for the P2P version if t =  X  (log N ), and thus achieves significant speed-up. Moreover, we presented a heuristic version of P2P. -greedy which has a lower network communication cost. Ex-periments support our theoretical results. As a fur-ther work, we plan to investigate how to adapt some appropriately randomized version of the UCB ban-dit algorithm( Auer et al. , 2002 ) to P2P environment.
