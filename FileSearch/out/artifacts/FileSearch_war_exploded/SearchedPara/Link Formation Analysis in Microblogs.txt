 Unlike a traditional social network service, a microblogging net-work like Twitter is a hybrid network, combining aspects of both social networks and information networks. Understanding the structure of such hybrid networks and to predict new links are im-portant for many tasks such as friend recommendation, community detection, and network growth models. In this paper, by analyz-ing data collected over time, we find that 90% of new links are to people just two hops away and dynamics of friend acquisition are also related to users X  account age. Finally, we compare two popu-lar sampling methods which are widely used for network analysis and find that ForestFire does not preserve properties required for the link prediction task.

The use of online social networks and social media in general has surged in recent years. In this work, we focus on the under-standing of link formation of one particular type of social service X  that of the microblogging network. In microblog services such as Twitter, Yammer and Google Buzz, participants form an explicit social network by  X  X ollowing X  (subscribing to) another user. Un-like common online social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn or Myspace, a followed user has the option but not the requirement to similarly follow back. Thus, relationships in these social net-works may be asymmetric. Thus, User B in a microblog service can generate messages, and any followers of B ,suchas A , will automatically receive those messages along with messages gener-ated by all other users that A follows. The combination of multiple message intentions and asymmetry of connections has led some to call microblogging services such as Twitter  X  X ybrid networks X  [4]. They are hybrid not just because they can carry multiple types of messages, but also because participants create links for multiple reasons X  X o be social (e.g., to connect online to existing offline so-cial contacts) or to link to an information source [4].
Recently, Golder et al. [2] discuss prediction specifically in Twit-ter. They analyze several principles for link prediction, such as shared interests, shared followers, and mutuality. Romero and Kleinberg [4] also introduce the hybrid network concept and study
Table 1: The distribution of relationship types for new links. the directed closure process in Twitter link formation. In this pa-per, by analyzing data collected over time, we will uncover more properties for the link formation in ego-centric networks.
We randomly sampled 1000 users out of 9,026,165 users active between early February and the end of March 2010. Though users may appear multiple times in the public timeline, we sampled by name, not by tweet, so highly active users had no additional selec-tion advantage. In the end, we had 979 users as our target users. We monitored daily the changes in the selected users X  ego-centric networks on Twitter. The number of immediate friends and follow-ers of the 979 target users was nearly 200,000. The data we used in this paper is from April 5th to May 12th, 2010. 2
By regularly monitoring changing networks, we can determine from where new links come. We examined the changes of ego-networks for each of the 979 users. We collected a total of 18,777 new friends for the 979 users. Most new users are friends of friends. In particular, 17,251 (91.78%) new friends were second level neighbors within the target user X  X  ego-network and the re-maining 781 ( P unknown =8 . 12% ) new friends were of unknown relationship (i.e., more than two hops away). For each new friend, we further check its relationship type with the 979 target users.
Table 1 shows the distribution of relationship patterns for each new friend, prior to link creation. For example,  X  X  X  means the new friend is the reciprocal friend of some reciprocal friend of the target users. Similarly,  X  X  X  means the new friend is the following-only friend of some following-only friend of the target user. It is similar for other types. Based on the results shown in Table 1, if
During monitoring, 21 users changed their privacy setting to "pro-tect", preventing us from continuing to collect their information.
The data is prior to the introduction of Twitter X  X  friend recommen-dation system which may introduce a link formation bias. (a) Change in number of friends. Figure 1: From April to August 2010, the changes in the median number of neighbors as a function of account age. we consider only two-hop neighbors in the ego-network as candi-dates to recommend as friends, we will only miss 8.12% of new friends. Another interesting result is that if the two users share an audience, it does not mean that they are interested in each other. Among two-hop users, most of the new friends have relationships  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  . In contrast, Romero and Kleinberg [4] only find  X  X  X  to be a factor of link formation. We extend their observations and find  X  X  X  is by far the most important indicator for future link formation.
We analyze the relationship between the changes in the size of a user X  X  network and user X  X  account age. We compare two snap-shots (April 5th 2010 and August 20th 2010) of profiles of 200,000 users. The results are shown in Figure 1. The x-axis is the user X  X  ac-count age and y-axis is the median change in the number of neigh-bors. We find that in the very beginning (within 100 days), the users add many friends and then for the older users (100-400 days), their friends seem more stable. For much older users (more than 500 days), we find that their number of new friends is larger and larger, not as we might expect. For followers, Figure 1(b) shows a rich get richer pattern; the older the user, the larger the increase in followers. A more detailed analysis (not shown for space) re-veals that young accounts (e.g., less than two years) have a larger (but decreasing over time) change in followers and friends, while more established accounts (from about two years on) have a more consistent relative growth rate.
Link prediction experiments are usually based on a sampled graph rather than the whole graph before deploying it on the real system. However, real dynamic data is often not available, in which case, artificial data is necessary. We study two methods. Forest-Fire [3] is a popular sampling method, preserving graph proper-ties on the sampled graph, such as some static properties (e.g., degree distributions, clustering coefficients), temporal properties (e.g., shrinking diameters) and cascading properties (shown in [1]). We sample a graph by ForestFire, which contains 1,607,178 users, and remove 10% links at random as test data. Another data set is based on the April 5th snapshot of ego-centric networks. For 1000 egos, we remove 10% links at random as test data, which we call Static data. Treating those removed data as the new links, we perform the same analysis experiment as Section 2.1 to ana-lyze whether the artificial data can retain properties consistent with real data. The results are also shown in Table 1. The Static data keeps consistent the distribution among all kinds of the two-hop re-lationships. For ForestFire, the properties are quite different from Dynamic: fewer than 10% of the candidates are found on the sec-Figure 2: Distribution of links with exactly x 2-hop paths in the graph generated by each sampling method ond hop, causing ego-network based structural methods, such as common neighbors and Jaccard X  X  coefficient, to fail on such cases.
Furthermore, the distribution of two-hop relationships are also changed in ForestFire. The fraction of  X  X  X  becomes very low and  X  X  X  becomes higher. We also draw the distribution of the num-ber of 2-hop paths from the target users to the candidates. Figure 2 shows the distribution of three data sets. We can see that the distri-bution of Static data is very similar to the Dynamic data, but the dis-tribution of ForestFire is considerably different from real Dynamic data. That means that even when we only use the candidates who are still available via two hops from the target users as our test data, the algorithms may still generate different performance, compared with the real Dynamic data. These experimental results suggests that for the link prediction task, the common evaluation method which is based on ForestFire sampled data may not produce the same the results as real data. Finally, we run a simple but popular method X  X accard X  X  coefficient X  X n the three data sets. 3 The results are 0.116 in Dynamic, 0.071 in Static, and 0.0013 in ForestFire data respectively. As we expect, it fails in the ForestFire data set and the performances on Dynamic and Static are somewhat similar.
By analyzing data collected over time, we find that 90% of new links are to people just two hops away and the dynamics of new link creation are affected by the user X  X  account age. Based on these properties, we compare two methods of collecting network data X  X orestFire and Ego-network sampling. The results show that ForestFire does not preserve important properties of the ego-network and is thus not suitable for the link prediction task.

We use the standard F 1 -measure in the break even point.
