 Time plays a central role in many web search information needs re-lating to recent events. For recency queries where fresh information is most desirable, there is likely to be a great deal of highly-relevant information created very recently by crowds of people across the world, particularly on platforms such as Wikipedia and Twitter. With so many users, mainstream events are often very quickly re-flected in these sources. The English Wikipedia encyclopedia con-sists of a vast collection of user-edited articles covering a range of topics. During events, users collaboratively create and edit ex-isting articles in near real-time. Simultaneously, users on Twitter disseminate and discuss event details, with a small number of users becoming influential for the topic. In this demo, we propose a novel approach to presenting a summary of new information and users re-lated to recent or ongoing events associated with the user X  X  search topic, therefore aiding most recent information discovery. We out-line methods to detect search topics which are driven by events, identify and extract changing Wikipedia article passages and find influential Twitter users. Using these, we provide a system which displays familiar tiles in search results to present recent changes in the event-related Wikipedia articles, as well as Twitter users who have tweeted recent relevant information about the event topics. Categories and Subject Descriptors: H.4 [Information Systems Applications] -Miscellaneous Keywords: Wikipedia, Twitter, Time, Events
A large volume of web searches are initiated by users searching for information related to recent or ongoing events [5]. Highly-relevant news articles are typically provided for these event-driven information needs using aggregated search results, incorporating a news article vertical (as seen in Figure 1). A vast amount of espe-cially fresh and informative recent information is being generated in near real-time by different crowds of users on social and collab-orative platforms such as Twitter 1 and Wikipedia 2 . However, these highly temporal sources are typically ignored in web search.
Since creation in early 2001, the founding user-edited English language encyclopaedia has grown to almost 4 million articles cov-This research is partially supported by the EU-funded project: LiMoSINe (288024). Figure 1: Demonstration screenshot for the search query  X  X uro 2012 X  in June 2012. Tile (1) displays event digests (i.e. recently changed passages) from Wikipedia articles related to the event. Tile (2) shows Twitter users most relevant to the search topic. ering a wide range of topics, each with an average of 19.64 user revisions 3 . Wikipedia encyclopaedia projects covering numerous languages have also become popular. Query log analysis sug-gests Wikipedia pages feature prominently in over 90% of searches. Meanwhile, Twitter has over 140 million active users providing over 340 million tweets a day 4 .

By presenting the latest event-related information using  X  X rowdTiles X  (i.e. tiles (1) and (2) in Figure 1), we provide a sum-mary of what is happening right now in the search results, thereby assisting the user in further discovery and exploration of the event and related topic information.

In this demo we propose a novel approach to integrating event-driven information in search results, provided by two crowds: anonymous users, and well-known people or organisations. Firstly, passages recently changed by anonymous users in Wikipedia arti-cles relevant to the event are shown (i.e., tile (1) in Figure 1). Sec-ondly, influential Twitter users for event topics can be found and included along with their most recent on-topic tweets (i.e., tile (2) in Figure 1). Presenting influential users rather than simply tweets provides valuable background and trust for limited tweet informa-tional content.

Real-time engineering and information reliability issues pose challenges for efficient and effective use of real-time data sources. As such, we are motivated to develop lightweight but robust ar-chitecture (shown in Figure 2), combining algorithmic approaches for both finding influential users for event topics on Twitter, and extracting recently changing passages from Wikipedia articles.
Wikipedia article authoring and editing activity is regularly prompted by users reporting ongoing real-world events, often very soon after they occurred [6]. To develop the algorithms we out-line in this section we had to use past data mined from historic Wikipedia archives. For this reason we illustrate examples using data taken over the period covering Whitney Houston X  X  death.
Houston X  X  death was first unofficially reported on Twitter at 00:15 UTC on the 12th February 2012 [1]. Although the news immediately spread through Twitter, it wasn X  X  until 00:57 UTC that the Associated Press verified the news on their Twitter feed (prior to releasing a proper news story). The first update to the Whit-ney Houston Wikipedia article referencing the circumstances of her death was at 01:01 UTC, 4 minutes after press confirmation. Dur-ing the period immediately after her death, article changes went from an average of less than 8 per day to over 120 per day.
Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) automatically detects and organizes event-based topics in streaming collections, such as broadcast news [2]. Wikipedia has unique characteristics compared to conventional TDT document collections as each topic is a single evolving document. In this section we outline an approach to per-forming the TDT story tracking task for a known topic as it devel-ops (i.e. tracking a particular Wikipedia article).
CrowdTiles for Wikipedia and Twitter are only shown when the user X  X  information need is event-driven. To determine this, a rel-evant Wikipedia article is found by detecting a Wikipedia-based result in the top 10 web search results. At this early stage, we sim-ply consider a Wikipedia article to be affected by an event, and therefore show the CrowdTiles, if it has received more than 10 text changes in the last 12 hours. Investigation of more reliable burst detection techniques for this task is left for future work.
Article editors distill event information from disparate sources such as Twitter and traditional news reports into referenced article changes, providing a succinct summary of event details. We extract this temporally  X  X ot X  text from the article to provide to users. In this early work we outline an approach for extracting event digests from a Wikipedia article during periods of event-based article change ac-tivity. Each digest is essentially a passage in the relevant Wikipedia article which has seen significant change over the last period of N article edits.
 Table 1: Nine digests for the Whitney Houston article at intervals of 20 edits following her death. References to external sources and other  X  X iki X  markup have been removed for readability.

To provide the digest, we extract the most-edited passages from the N th revision in the N -edit period (i.e., the 20th revision in a 20-edit period). A lower N will result in more sensitive and up-to-date digests, however, risking lower precision if a user makes a number of edits that are not event related. Conversely, a higher N will generally be more robust and take into account longer term and more persistent event-related changes.

As the article is evolving, it is impossible to simply track the passage which has received the most changes, as passages are con-stantly being added, changed and removed between edits.

We therefore treat digest extraction as an intra-document re-trieval problem. The query is essentially the edit terms over the last N -edit period and the retrievable documents are passages con-tained within the article X  X  text. To illustrate the temporal nature of edit terms, the most common edit terms for the Whitney Houston article after her death are shown in Figure 3.

A weighted boolean retrieval model appeared most robust for identifying intuitively relevant passages to use as digests. We dis-carded term frequency as it was adversely affected by non-uniform passage lengths. A weighted approach was necessary to increase the importance of previously unseen terms being added to the arti-cle (e.g.  X  X eath X  or  X  X ilton X  as opposed to  X  X hitney X  or  X  X ouston X ).
Term weighting uses an analogue of the traditional inverse doc-ument frequency statistic [4] (IDF). We compute the specificity of an edit term t to provide the boolean weight t weight = t where t editFrequency is the frequency of the edit term in the N -edits period, and t articleFrequency is the edit term frequency in the com-plete article text (i.e. collection frequency). Each passage score is computed as  X  t weight , for query terms present in the passage.
The outcome of running this digest extraction algorithm is il-lustrated in Table 1 for the Whitney Houston article in the period Figure 3: Most frequent terms appearing in edits made to the Whit-ney Houston article in the 3 days after her death. shortly after her death, as details are unfolding. All digests with the exception of period 8 are on the topic of her death. Closer inspec-tion indicates that this was caused by a burst of edits made to her background discography information at that time.
 Related Article Identifier. In the  X  X uro 2012 X  example shown in Figure 1, while the central Wikipedia article  X  X EFA Euro 2012 X  is most relevant, further articles may become temporally associated with the event. For example, during an England game, not only may the team X  X  article get regular changes, but so too will promi-nent players such as  X  X ayne Rooney X . Displaying recently changed information from these highly temporal articles is likely to help the user better understand the event details unfolding.

Changes made to strongly associated Wikipedia articles can be included by exploiting the rich Wikipedia link structure. Previous work by Ciglan and N X rv X g [3] used a graph-based spreading ac-tivation approach to propagate article viewing popularity over the link structure. As the intention of this work is purely to extract event-related passages, we instead apply the same passage extrac-tion algorithm to articles that are directly linked to from the ini-tially retrieved Wikipedia article, and which are also receiving a large number of recent changes.
Rather than tweets alone, we instead chose to present users with tweets, as the tweet author X  X  background may often express the trustworthiness of the limited tweet content. Existing approaches for topic-specific influencer detection typically rely on network-based approaches which offer effective solutions to the problem, however are infeasible in a vast and highly amorphous network such as Twitter X  X  full social graph. Furthermore, relevant influ-ential users may change relatively quickly over time as the event focus and discussion change.

To present relevant Twitter users and their tweets in CrowdTiles, the Twitter search API 5 is used to retrieve recently relevant tweets for the event topic, with further ranking performed on user features.
Both stable and temporally important (i.e., most recently distinc-tive) terms for the event topic are expressed in the most frequent terms appearing in Wikipedia article edits, as shown in Figure 3. The temporal distribution of each term is a strong indicator of the term X  X  stability in the event topic, and therefore, its usefulness to retrieve descriptive high quality tweets both relevant, and recently topical for the event. In Figure 3, the distribution of the term  X  X eath X  is relatively stable throughout the 3 day duration represented. In contrast, terms such  X  X lcohol X  and  X  X ilton X  are much more temporal as they burst with new event developments.

Considering that the distribution of terms is essentially a time-series, established time-series analysis methods can be used to mea-sure the temporal characteristics. Stable terms are discovered by aggregating the appearance of each term over a series of time win-dows (e.g. the term appears on average 2.4 times every 6 hours). Similarly, temporally important terms are extracted by computing a recency score for each new term to appear in the article edits. This score is defined as a simple measure: the frequency of appearances of the term in a recent time window (e.g. the last 24 hours) minus the frequency of older appearances of the term prior to the time window, thus penalizing terms which are less new to the article.
After extracting the most stable and temporally important terms from the Wikipedia article edit terms, a query containing a selection of the terms is constructed to retrieve recently relevant tweets for the event. Stable terms ensure retrieved tweets are on-topic for the event, while temporally important terms ensure the tweet is about recent developments. From this set of retrieved tweets, a set of candidate influential Twitter users is then extracted.

Ranking Influential Users. We rank Twitter users by the sim-ple ratio of their friends to followers, thereby promoting influential accounts with considerably more followers than friends. Further work will explore additional features for ranking users based on tweet features, including retweet counts and event coverage in their previous tweets.
A live demonstration is available at: http://www. stewartwhiting.com/CrowdTiles.htm . Figure 2 is the current architecture for the experimental CrowdTiles system.
Wikipedia publishes a stream of all real-time activity (e.g. arti-cle creation and editing) to both an internet relay chat (IRC) chan-nel and syndication feed 6 . An application programming interface (API) provides access to current article revision metadata and text. Finding influential Twitter users relies on publicly accessible Twitter REST APIs. The CrowdTiles interface is developed in C# and built into a prototype front-end of the Microsoft Bing search engine. Two demonstration scenarios are planned. For non-event topic searches, CrowdTiles will not display. For any search query related to a recent event, CrowdTiles will be trig-gered and show a number of most changed and most relevant pas-sages extracted from the directly relevant search topic/event-related Wikipedia article. If there are other closely related articles which have also been frequently changed recently, passages from them will be displayed in later tiles. Multiple digests will be presented in a transitioning series of tiles. At most 5 influential Twitter users will be selected for the topic and presented in a series of transition-ing tiles, including the user X  X  bio and recent related tweets.
