 1. Introduction
The World Wide Web has become a key medium for promoting and developing the academic, scientific and educational spreading the prestige of these educational institutions all over the world. This has provoked competition between univer-sities to achieve an advantageous visibility on the Web and to improve their position in search engine results.
Web performance has been analysed from different points of view. Web data have been used as an indicator of the edu-Heimeriks and Van Den Besselaar (2006) used these analysis techniques to detect four geographical zones in the European Union (EU) academic web space: Scandinavia, UK, Germany and South Europe. Similar results were obtained by Ortega,
Aguillo, Cothey, and Scharnhorst (2008) , finding that European universities are grouped in local or national sub-networks which are connected with other sub-networks for linguistic or geographical reasons (Thelwall, 2002b; Thelwall, Tang, &amp; spaces in Europe, describing the European web relationships at the country level.
 and consistent population has not been attempted. 2. Objectives
The purpose of this paper is to present a visual display of the 1000 most important universities in the World according to the Ranking Web of World Universities (www.webometrics.info ). This map intends to show the topological characteristics of this network and to describe the relationships among universities of different countries and continents. We also present, through network analysis techniques, the most important universities in the network structure, the gateway universities that connect different web spaces or sub-networks and the network core. 3. Methods 3.1. Data extraction
We have selected the first 1000 higher education institutions from the Ranking Web of World Universities. This ranking orders the universities according to four main web characteristics from their institutional web domain. The volume of con-number of document indexed in Google Scholar is an indicator of the scientific publications on the Web. Each web domain is ranked by the linear aggregation of these indicators, building the webometrics ranking (WR)
More information about the methodology of Ranking Web of World Universities is available in About the Ranking (www.webometrcis.info/about_rank.html ) and in Methodology ( www.webometrics.info/methodology.html ).
Together, these indicators make it possible to describe the performance of these academic institutions on the Web, being a complement to other educational and scientific rankings. The main search engines (Google, Yahoo! Search, Live Search and Exalead) are used to implement this ranking (Aguillo, Ortega, &amp; Fernandez, 2008 ).

Thousand institutions were selected because a digital divide was perceived between North American universities and the (Aguillo et al., 2008 ). Hence, we have decided to take a wide sample that represents all the continents.
An asymmetric link matrix between this set of universities was built. So, the rows show the inlinks received by each web domain and the columns the number of outlinks that a web domain makes. This asymmetric matrix is necessary in order to are not the same to links from university domain B to A.

Data extraction was made in February 2008 from Yahoo! Search. It allows several search operators in a single search string and the web coverage is rather wide. The following queries were used to obtain links from the university domain (A) to the university domain (B) and vice versa: site: {university domain (A)} linkdomain:{university domain (B)} and to obtain the total number of pages indexed in the university domain (A): site: {university domain (A)}
An SQL routine was used to submit the 1001000 needed queries to build the link matrix. 3.2. Geographical map was downloaded from Blue Marble Geographics web site (www.bluemarblegeo.com ) in ESRI shapefile format. We used the geographical information system (GIS) software MapViewer 6 to build the final map. This map has two layers: a hutch map which represents the number of web pages by country and a flow map which shows the links between countries. Quanti-tative data such as number of web pages and in-and outlinks were added through a spreadsheet and assigned to each map zone (country). The classification method used in both layers was Jenks X  natural breaks ( Jenks, 1963 ). This method determines the best arrangement of values into classes by iteratively comparing sums of the squared difference between sults, because it creates more significant differences between classes. 3.3. Network graph
A network graph was built with the links between the 1000 university web domains. Several variables have been used in order to add information about the network configuration. Nodes size shows the volume of web pages that each university publishes on the Web, colours represent the nationality of each higher education organization and arc width shows the fre-quency of in-and outlinks between two university domains.

The software used to visualise the network was Pajek 1.02. Links matrix was converted to a network file (.net) and the
These three files were merged to present the final graph output. We selected a cut-off of minimum 50 links to improve the network visualization. Also we used the Fruchterman X  X eingold algorithm to lay out the network because it is the fast for large networks (de Nooy, Mrvar, &amp; Batagelj, 2005).
 Several social network indicators were used to describe the network topology and the main characteristics of the nodes: scale networks, such as the Web, the core with the highest degree is the central core of the network, detecting the set of nodes the network rests on ( Seidman, 1983 ).

Degree: the number of lines connecting a node. This can be normalized (nDegree) by the total number of nodes in the net-work. In a directed network such as the Web we can count only the incoming links (InDegree) or the outgoing links (Out-Kretschmer, 2006 ), while OutDegree as the property to generate web traffic.

Betweenness: the capacity of one node to help connect those nodes that are not directly connected to each other. Its nor-malization is the percentage over the total number of nodes in the network. From a webometric point of view, this mea-sure allows us to detect hubs or gateways that connect different web sub-networks (Faba-P X rez, Zapico-Alonso, Guerrero-
Bote &amp; Moya-Aneg X n, 2005; Ingwersen, 1998 ). 4. Results 4.1. Descriptive analysis Prior to the link analysis we made a frequency distribution by country of the 1000 selected universities. are 36.9% of the entire sample, followed by the United Kingdom (UK) (6.8%) and Germany (6.6%). This distribution is also formance of poorer countries like Russia (0.6%) and India (0.4%) is also clear. 4.2. Geographical map 1
Fig. 1 shows the geographical distribution of web pages by country and the incoming and outgoing links among these countries. Two regions stand out for their large amount of web pages: North America (USA and Canada) and the European
Union (EU) zone. The USA is the country with most web pages (50.57%), holding half of the world X  X  academic web pages in-two zones have no universities in the sample: Africa (with the exception of South Africa) and the Middle East (with the exception of Israel and Saudi Arabia).

From the US position, the upper loops show the outgoing links and the lower loops the incoming ones. The most impor-tant link flows are between North American countries and EU countries, while second are links between East Asian and Oce-anic countries and the US. 4.3. Network graph
The World class network (Fig. 2 ) shows clustering because its clustering coefficient ( C = 527.25) is considerably higher tant clusters (Fig. 2 ). The in and out degree frequency distributions follow a power law trend ( c scale-free properties as well (Barabasi, Albert, &amp; Jeong, 2000 ).
 own country. Thus, we can visually detect homogeneous national groups such as Germany (red), the UK (light green) or
Japan (orange). 2 However, we can also see that there are countries that do not constitute a compact group such as France (dark blue), Canada (white) and other countries with a small set of universities such as the Netherlands (dark red). This may be because some countries are included in other larger national sub-networks, indeed Canada is related to the US and the Netherlands with the UK. This describes a cumulative process in which each national sub-network is aggregated to other ones like an accreation model.
 The graph also shows linguistic (Thelwall et al., 2003 ) and geographical relationships (Thelwall, 2002a, 2002b ). The
European countries are located on the top side of the picture, while the bottom side is mainly taken up by Asian and American ones. It shows, for example, that Spanish (purple) universities are between the European and the La-tin-American ones. Observe that size is related to link attraction, because the large universities are located in the core of the network. Nevertheless, some countries, specifically Asian ones (China, Japan and Taiwan), have large universities that are far from the core. This may be caused by low development of English pages by these countries ( Vaughan &amp; Thelwall, 2004 ).
 The main core of the World network was detected with the k -cores method. The central core is 116 nodes with degree 93.
This highly connected cluster has 98 American universities. The rest are from Canada (7) and Europe (11). Fig. 3 shows in
Trier and the German one and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ) and Switzerland. This principal uni-versities act as gateways that connect their sub-networks to the network core, causing a high density of the network. How-some Asiatic ones which are located around the Unites States sub-network. This may cause that countries do not linguistic and geographically integrated with other countries are mainly connected to the USA ones which have a great weight on the network.

We also calculated the in-and out-degree of each university according to all the network and ranked it. Hence Table 2 University of Amsterdam in 22nd.

As above, the World network is the aggregated union of national sub-networks. The betweenness centrality index de-tects the gateway universities that tend to connect these national sub-networks with the remaining ones. Table 4 shows the principal universities in each country according to their betweenness centrality. For example, the Japanese university with highest betweenness centrality in all the network is the University of Tokyo and the Taiwanese one is the National
Taiwan University. Because this network is constituted by national sub-networks (Fig. 2 ), betweeness centrality may be considered as a suitable indicator in order to show universities with more international scope. Thus, we can identify the outstanding universities in each country such as MIT in the US, Cambridge in the UK or ETHZ in Switzerland. Thus, these universities connect local web spaces internationally. However, there are no German or Spanish universities in the top positions, although both countries have a good position in the network. We suggest that as there is a linguistic factor in the relationships between countries, the German-speaking network is represented by ETHZ and the Spanish-speaking one by the Autonomous National University of Mexico (UNAM). Moreover, the betweenness index is rather close network.
 5. Discussion
For some while now, the use of search engine data has been discussed because of the instability of their results over a some search engines have serious problems indexing and retrieving non-Latin characters such as Japanese, Chinese or Rus-sian. Vaughan and Thelwall (2004) showed that there is a local bias in favour of US and against East Asian web sites which web domains are remotely located in the graph ( Fig. 2 ), although they have many web pages. The great presence of the US we will have to compare how different search engines harvest web pages. Using a crawler will avoid these problems; how-ever, to crawl 1000 web domain is a hard task. Hence, interpreting these results must take into account these biases.
The link flows and web page distribution in the geographical map (Fig. 1) follow a similar pattern to the European Union  X  X  X ateway X  universities act as hubs/authorities that connect the national communities or sub-networks between them ( Bar-of small-world phenomena on the Web (Bjorneborn, 2003 ). 6. Conclusions
The world-class university network graph is comprised of national sub-networks that merge in a central core where the United States, which dominates the world network in conjunction with the aggregation of the European ones, especially the
British and the German sub-networks. This situation may be caused mainly by the technological development of these coun-backward situation of some East Asian countries.
