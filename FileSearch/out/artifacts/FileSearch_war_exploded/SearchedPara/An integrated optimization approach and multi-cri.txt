 1. Introduction
Due to population expansion and economic development, global waste generation is increasing rapidly. Annual generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) has increased by 8% in China since 2000, and this variation increase is becoming more and more complicated ( Su et al., 2008 ). MSW management is associated with many related processes and factors (Huang and Chang, 2003 ; Cheng et al., 2003 ; Li et al., 2006 ), which are complicated by interactive, dynamic and uncertain features issues ( Li et al., 2008 ; Huang and Chang, 2003 ;
Zhou et al., 2008 ). Therefore, a systematic approach for analyzing waste management, under the above-mentioned complexities, is needed to support decisions of concerning short-term waste-management operation and long-term strategic planning.

Interval mathematical programming (IMP) has been widely used for environmental management systems, including water resource, air quality, energy system and waste management (Huang et al., 1995 ; Chanas and Kuchta, 1996 ; Liu et al., 2000 ; Qin et al., 2007, 2008 ; Lu et al., 2008a, 2008b ; He et al., 2008 ; Li et al., 2006 ). It can tackle uncertainties that cannot be quantified by membership function or probability distribution. The results from IMP can be used for generating a range of decision alternatives under various system conditions, and thus help MSW managers to identify desired waste-managemen t policies. Through chance-con-strained programming (CCP), stoch astic uncertainties derived from risks of constraint violations will be revealed. Moreover, mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) could offer decision bases in terms of facility expansion. Therefore, the cooperation of the three methods above, inexact chance-constrained mixed-integer linear programming (ICMILP) could be effectively used for dealing with the uncertainties that exist in parameters, which including right-and left-hand side, and even spatial and temporal variations, could be addressed. However, further post-analysis is still required for achieving more reasonable management system.

In order to achieve an effective and optimal waste-management system, different scenarios were considered based on various conditions. Further analysis needed to be provided for waste managers to achieve the optimal solutions. However, it is still difficult to weight the advantages and disadvantages among different solutions because of the interaction of various factors (e.g. economic development, social policy, environmental quality) and parameters (e.g. operation cost, transportation cost, and waste-generation rate) in waste-management systems. Therefore, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) ( Cheng et al., 2003 ), an effective approach to address the above problem, was introduced to determine the optimal solution among different schemes. One approach of fuzzy MCDA methods was exemplified by Kwakernaak (1979) ,and Cheng and McInnis (1980) substituting the operations in the MCDA operations by using fuzzy sets.

Previously, many MCDA models were proposed for solid waste-management problems. For example, Hipel (1982) developed a multi-criteria model for supporting solid waste-management pro-blem in Canada. Hokkanen and Salminen (1994, 1997) provided effective approaches with MCDA methods for solving solid waste-management issues. Cheng et al. (2003) integrated MCDA and IMLP methods to support the selection of landfill locations and waste-flow allocation patterns in the City of Regina, and thus the system cost can be minimized. Guo and Lu (2008) proposed a multi-criteria approach for selecting the optimal waste-management strategies among 5 alternative schemes in Shanghai, China.

Although many studies of waste management under uncer-tainty were conducted for a number of cities in the world, there has been no previous studies focusing on the development of an integrated optimization model with multi-criteria decision ana-lysis (MDCA) for supporting a real-world waste-management case. To fill this gap, this study aims to propose an integrated inexact chance-constrained mixed-integer linear programming (ICMILP) and MCDA model for supporting solid waste manage-ment in Beijing, China. The ICMILP model can effectively address the uncertainties presented as not only discrete intervals but also probabilities and generate solutions that represent flexible ranges for decision makers of facility-expansion and waste-flow allocation. Based on the practical situation in Beijing, different scenarios will be defined based on the current situation, local government strategies and environmental quality demands, and thus different schemes can be presented as the alternative plans for decision makers. Because each scenario has its advantages and disadvantages, MCDA will be proposed as a decision basis for waste managers. Therefore, effective optimization schemes and multi-criteria decision analysis are both desired for waste managers for the tradeoff between environmental quality and economic objectives. 2. Waste-management system in the City of Beijing located in the northern part of the North China Plain. The population of the city was 16.33 million at the end of 2007 ( City of
Beijing, 2006 ), including 12.13 million permanent residents and 4.19 million migrant population. The waste-management system in the city, which consists of eight urban districts (Dongcheng,
Xicheng, Chongwen, Xuanwu, Chaoyang, Haidian, Fengtai, Shijing shan) and ten suburb districts (shown in Fig. 1 ) is full of complexities. Over 90% of the waste is buried in landfills. Only a fraction of all the waste is disposed by incineration or composting.
Conceptual and historical reasons make Beijing a typical city of northern China, with insufficient land and a high growth rate of waste generation.
 2.1. Waste generation
The waste-management department only took waste treatment into account seriously in the last decade. Based on the statistics of the Beijing Solid Waste Administration Develop-ment, the average annual waste-generation rate has been increased by 7.85% in the 1990s ( City of Beijing, 2006 ). The daily average generation amount was 12,000 ton in 2008, and 0.82 kg per person (i.e. 4.38 million tons per year). With population expansion and economic development, the volume of garbage increased at a rate of approximately 2% per year (shown in Fig. 2 ).
The local government has put much effort on waste-management system, such as increasing waste-management investment to improve the treatment efficiency and enhancing its classified collection system to achieve the waste reduction goal. Therefore, the increasing rate had slowed down, decreasing to 2.52% in the period of the Ninth and Tenth Five-year Plan (2007).

Table 1 shows the waste components in 2000 and 2005, and the predicted ones in 2010, 2015 and 2020 ( Zhou et al., 2004 ). It is indicated that over 50% of the MSW is organic, and it keeps increase. On the contrary, the percentages of paper, plastic, and glass are declining from 2000 to 2020. There are three factors contributed to this phenomenon: the classification collection system improved the recyclable rate; various policies have been implemented to enhance the recycling system; the growing population has also caused the increase of organic waste (Ye and Han, 2000 ; Han et al., 2000; Zhang, 2003 ). All of these should direct the waste managers X  attention to composting facilities. 2.2. Waste collection and transportation
The collection and transportation systems in urban districts and suburb districts are different. Most of the waste generated in urban districts is collected by residents first and then sent to corresponding transfer stations for pretreatment; while the waste generated in suburb districts is shipped to management facilities directly with no stops during the transportation process.
There are 6 transfer stations with the total capacity of 5500 ton/d, charged with the classification and pretreatment of MSW so as to increase the utilization rate and volume reduction efficiency. It was estimated that through compression and dehydration, most of the leachate would be removed, and the compression ratio would be 2.4 X 4 times of waste compactors (Xi et al., 2007 ), thus prolonging the landfills X  lifespan and alleviating traffic pressure. There are four processes of waste-management system in the City of Beijing, including collection, pretreatment, treatment and marketing. The waste is firstly pretreated in transfer stations after collection; then been transported to different treatment facilities. Residues resulted from composting and incineration would be transported to landfills for final disposal. Revenue can be obtained from power generation through landfill gas and incineration heat, and composting product can be produced through composting processes. The waste flow in Beijing is shown in Fig. 3 . 2.3. Waste treatment facilities
The main approaches for waste treatment include landfill, composting and incineration, which constituted 89.6%, 5.8% and 4.6%, respectively, in 2006 ( City of Beijing, 2006 ). This indicates that approximately 90% of the MSW is buried in landfills. However, the conventional single-choice management is inadequate for effective waste disposal and environmental requirements. There are 28 waste-management facilities located in the districts, including 17 landfills, 2 composting and 3 incinerators, as shown in Fig. 1 . All the waste generated in urban districts is disposed of by the facilities located in suburb districts; and all of the 10 suburb districts have their own waste treatment facilities. 2.4. Diversion rate
Diversion rate, i.e. utilization, is defined as the summation percentage of waste treated in incineration and composting facilities. The study time horizon is 15 years, which is divided into three planning periods. In order to reduce the waste treated by landfill and prolong the existing landfills X  lifespan, the diversion rate needs to be gradually increased in Beijing. In detail, the waste treated by incineration: composting: landfill should achieve 3:3:4 by the end of 2020. To establish an integrated optimization system on the scale of the entire city is the main objective for Beijing in the long term. The following scenarios are based on the different demands of communities. 3. Scenario settings and data collection
Three different scenarios are established correspond to related policies and practice situations. The diversion rates for these scenarios are shown in Fig. 4 .

Scenario 1 is based on an assumption that solid waste-management activities in the city will keep the existing pattern over the entire planning horizon. There will be limited expansion plans for incineration and most of the waste will be disposed of by landfills in the next 15 years. The diversion rate would be increased gradually, reaching 30% by the end of planning horizon.
Scenario 2 is based on the balance between a long-term planning objective and the current situation. In this scenario, over 80% of the waste would still be disposed of by landfills in the first period, and would be decreased to 40% in period 3. Therefore, the diversion rate in this scenario would be 60% by the end of the planning horizon, which is a medium value between scenarios 1 and 3, considering the practical situation and high diversion demand in the long term.

Scenario 3 is based on the lon g-term point of view that the objective of the government will be achieved in the next 15 years.
The utilization rate will be greatly enhanced and landfills X  lifespan will be prolonged effectively. The r elated policy indicates that the diversion rate will be increased by 60% within 15 years. Waste treated by incinerating and composti ng facilities will account for 40% and 30%, respectively. A higher diversion rate may lead to a higher resource-utilization rate and a longer lifespan for landfills. Scenario 3 is considered more environmental friendly than the others. disposal facilities and revenues (as shown in Table 2 ) are based on findings by the Ministry of Construction (2006a, 2006b, 2006c) .
It is indicated that the operation cost will go up along with time over the entire planning horizon because of the improvement of related treatment technology. Due to the increasing waste generation and insufficient treatment capacity, facility-expansion is considered during the entire planning horizon. Table 3 shows capacity expansion options and their capital costs. 4. Formulation 4.1. The optimization method parameters are presented as interval forms. For example, opera-tion costs are fluctuated within intervals instead of being deterministic, which can be solved by the interval mathematical programming (IMP) method. Moreover, the rapid development of the economy and increasing population lead to the increased waste flows from the transfer stations to various facilities. The chance-constrained programming (CCP) method was introduced into this framework to reflect the risk of overwhelming facility-capacity constraints. Furthermore, in order to meet the demands of increasing waste-generation rate and insufficient capacity of treatment facilities, expansion may need to be considered.
Therefore, ICCMILP, incorporated by IMP, CCP and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) method, is provided for supporting long-term waste management in Beijing.
 cost with a series of constraints based on the current waste-management situation in Beijing. The constraints are sorted into 5 groups: (1) capacity balance constraints: for all the facilities, the total waste flow to each facility cannot exceed the sum of its total capacity of both new and existing capacities; (2) mass balance constraints: there should be a balance of waste flows from source location to destination, and all the waste generated in each district should be disposed of; (3) waste residue constraints: there would be a certain percentage of residue resulting from the waste going into the incinerators and composting facilities, and it needs to be shipped to landfills for final treatment; (4) facility-expansion constraint: the expansion for each facility can only happen once in any given period; and (5) all the decision variables are positive, and every integer variable varies from 0 to 1.

Fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis the provided ICCMILP model, MCDA model is used to identify the optimal strategies. The solutions from the optimization model are used as input parameters to the MCDA model. The criteria used presents as both numerical and linguistic impact values. Thus, a fuzzy MCDA method is introduced in this study for converting fuzzy inputs to their crisp values. Hwang and Yoon (1981) proposed an effective solution with two-phase procedures. After linguistic values were transformed into numerical values through fuzzy set theory, any classical multiple-attribute decision-making methods can be applied to solve the problem.
 public, qualitative factors in an evaluation matrix are converted into crisp numbers between 0 and 1. According to Hwang and Yoon (1981) , a systematic approach was proposed for transforming the verbal terms into unique numeric values. In order to transfer fuzzy sets to crisp sets, mean L X  X  scoring method will be utilized (Hwang and Yoon, 1981), according to the fuzzy maximum and fuzzy minimum functions. The fuzzy maximum and fuzzy minimum functions are defined as follows ( Chen and Hwang, 1992 ): m min  X  x  X  1 x ; 0 r x r 1 ; The right score refers to the intersection point of the fuzzy set
M with the fuzzy max. The right score of membership function can be determined as  X  M  X  X  sup  X  m M  X  x  X  4 m max  X  x  X  ;
Then the left score refers to the intersection point of the fuzzy set M with the fuzzy min can be determined as follows:  X  M  X  X  sup  X  m M  X  x  X  4 m min  X  x  X  ;
Thus the total score of M can be obtained by the following function:  X  M  X  X  sup  X  m M  X  x  X  X  1 m min  X  x  X  = 2
With the above functions, the linguistic terms existing in the weight vectors can be converted to crisp numbers. Then the classical MCDA methods can be used to evaluate the alternative solutions.

Three classical methods are applied in this study to determine the best alternative scenario for waste-management system in Beijing, including Simple Weighted addition (SWA), Weighted
Product (WP) and TOPSIS. SWA and WP methods are the simplest multiple-attribute utility methods, since they are easy use and understand by decision makers. The method of SWA is formulated as follows:
U  X  where w i is the importance or weight of the attribute; r element of the normalized impact matrix. The addition among impact values could not reflect the interaction among impact values. For the method of WP, multiplication is used and could address the positive power to indicate a benefit attribute, and a negative power to indicate a cost attribute. It is formulated to
U  X  where w i is the importance weight of the i th attribute and x impact value of the j th alternative.

TOPSIS is a technique developed by Hwang and Yoon (1981).The foundation of TOPSIS is different with the previous two methods. It is based on the relatively straight-forward assumption that each attribute takes a monotonically increasing utility. Thus, it is possible to identify the  X  X  X deal X  X  solution which consists of all best data attainable, and the  X  X  X orst X  X  solution that consists of all worst data attainable. In this method, the order preferences are selected by the alternatives with the minimum distance from the ideal solution and the maximum distance from the worst solution. After the normalization of the impact matrix, the formulas for calculating are as follows: u  X  w i r ij ; i  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; n ; j  X  1 ; 2 ; ... ; m ;
A  X f X  max
A  X f X  min where I represents the index set of benefit attributes and while A is the worst scheme for the objective. Next step is to calculate the distance from individual r ij to the ideal one and the worst one. Finally, the alternatives can be ranked according to the distance in descending order and the one with the maximum utility value is the most preferable solution. 5. Results and discussions 5.1. The result from the optimization method
The main purpose of this study is to prolong the lifespan of landfills with minimum system cost and maximum treatment efficiency, based on related policy and environmental regulations in Beijing.
 The facility-expansion results from scenario 1 are shown in Fig. 5 . This illustrates that the capacities of landfills would be expanded by an increment of 700 ton per day to meet the diversion rate of scenario 1. The capacities of incineration and composting facilities would only be expanded at the end of the planning horizon (the increment of 400 and [400, 600] ton/day for the Miyun Incinerator and Nangong Composting, respectively, in period 3). The waste flows with different q i levels are shown in Figs. 6 X 8 . It is indicated that the waste flows allocated to the landfills would be decreased with the increased q i level, while waste allocated to composting and incinerating facilities would be increased with the growing q i levels. These demonstrate that a higher risk level of q i implies a relaxed facility capacities X  constraint, but the restrictions are much stricter for the facility with relatively high operation costs.

Fig. 9 shows the system costs under three scenarios. The system costs under scenario 1 would be $[139, 179] 10 9 with q =0.1, and it would be increased to [144, 183] 10 9 with q of 0. This demonstrates that a higher violation rate would result in a lower system cost, which is around 150 million dollars for the next 15 years under scenario 1. Therefore, lower violation rate may lead to higher system cost, while it may cause a high level of utilization rate.

Scenario 2: Table 4 shows the optimization results from scenario 2. It demonstrated that the waste treated by the landfills would be more than those under scenario 1, leading to a high utilization rate. There would be no facility-expansion for the landfills over the entire planning horizon. Thereby the landfills X  lifespan would be prolonged by 5 years compared with the result under scenario 1. For composting facilities, an increment of 600 ton/day would be added to Nangong Composting at the start of each period, and 800 ton/day would be added to Asuwei Composting at the end of the planning horizon.

In order to meet the relatively high diversion rate under this scenario, more waste would be shipped to composting and incinerating facilities, and higher system cost would be paid for the higher operation cost of those two treatment facilities.
Therefore, a high utilization rate (i.e. diversion rate) may lead to a high system cost. Solutions corresponding to the lower-bound of system costs (i.e. 14.1, 14.4 and 14.6 million dollars at the q 0.1, 0.05, 0.01 and 0, respectively) represent an alternative under the most optimistic waste-generation mode; while the upper-bound system costs (18.6, 18.7 18.8 and 19.1 million dollars at the q 2500 3500 4500 5500 6500
Upper-bound of waste flows (t/d)
Upper-bound waste flows (t/d)
Upper-bound waste flows (t/d) of 0.1, 0.05 and 0.01, respectively) correspond to a more con-servative consideration. Thus, the interval solutions can be used for generating decision alternatives through adjustment of decision-variable values within their solution intervals according to the projected applicable conditions.

Scenario 3: Aiming at the 11th Five-Year Plan in Beijing, the waste-management strategies should follow the solutions from scenario 3 as it shown in Table 5 . The optimal solutions from scenario 3 are shown in Table 6 . Most of the waste would be disposed of by incinerating and composting facilities instead of landfills as in the previous 2 scenarios. Therefore, large scale facility-expansion for incinerating and composting facilities would be considered. The landfills X  lifespan would be prolonged by 7 years compared with those under scenario 1and 2 year under scenario 2. The Dongcun and Huairou Incinerators would be expanded by an increment of 600 ton/day at the beginning of both periods 2 and 3, leading to 1850 ton/day, which is 600 ton/day larger than those under scenario 2. Moreover an increment of 600 ton/day would be implemented at the start of each period, reaching 2500 ton/day at the end of the planning horizon.

These solutions would alleviate the problem of insufficient land and improve the utilization rate. However it may lead to higher system cost compared to those under scenarios 1 and 2. System costs would vary between 15 and 19 million dollars with different q levels for both lower and upper bounds, as shown in Fig. 9. 5.2. Post-analysis based on MCDA
The solutions from the predefined scenarios are used as the input parameters of the MCDA model. Because the inputs are qi = 0.05 qi = 0.01 required to be deterministic rather than interval-format, the median of the inexact solutions are used as inputs in the MCDA model. Four criteria (as shown in Table 6 ), including diversion rate, prolonging the years of a landfill X  X  lifespan, system cost and public acceptance, are used as the evaluation indexes in this model when the requirements of waste manager, environmental quality, and public concern are taken into account. Specifically, diversion rate is defined as the summation percentage of waste treated in incineration and composting facilities; prolonged years of the landfills X  lifespan can be achieved when the new scheme of waste-management system is applied; public acceptance is defined as the acceptance level of the local residents; system cost means the total cost of waste collection, transportation, operation and expansion. The weights of the indexes were derived from the domain expert consultations and questionnaire surveys in Beijing. The public acceptance level of each waste-management strategy was obtained through public survey, and the other three indexes can be achieved by the ICCMILP method provided.
The weight values were obtained from discussions with environmental experts, public questionnaires and decision makers.
The results indicate that insufficient land is the crucial factor to be considered during the decision making processes; system cost is another impact factor for waste managers; meanwhile, meeting the demand of public satisfaction is also important for decision makers.
Table 7 shows the ranking index using different scenarios. Three methods (i.e. WPS, WP, and TOPSIS) are applied to this multi-criteria problem for the waste-management system to find a set of preference orders among various alternatives. A j represents the j th alternative schemes ( A 1 , A 2 and A 3 denote the result from scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively).
 their results are shown in Table 7 . It is indicated that the result from scenario 3 is the most favorable set, while the order for the second most favorable set is different under the methods of WP and TOPSIS. In order to summarize the results achieved from different methods, a statistical method, named Average Ranking
Procedure, will be applied to aggregate the preference levels (Hwang and Yoon (1981) ).

The Average Ranking Procedure, the simplest technique among the three aggregation methods, ranks the alternatives according to the average rankings from the fuzzy MCDA methods. The smaller the index value is, the more preferable the alternative is.
The results with the Average Ranking Procedure are solved according to Hwang (1981). It is indicated that scenario 3 is the most favorable one among three different methods. With the method of SWA, scenario 1 ranks second, and scenario 2 is the least favorable set. However, scenario 2 ranks second under the method of WP and TOPSIS, and scenario 1 ranks last. When it comes to the average ranking, as shown in Table 8 , among all of the three different methods, the average ranking of scenario 3 is first, indicating that scenario 3 is the  X  X  X est X  X  scheme and would not lead to the worst impact under any conditions. On the other hand, the scheme under scenario 1, with an average ranking of 2.33, is the least safe alternative for the waste management in
Beijing. Scenario 2 ranks second among the three scenarios with an average ranking of 2.66. Based on an analysis of the tradeoff among system cost, public satisfaction, prolonged years of landfills X  lifespan and utilization rate, Scenario 3, with the highest diversion rate and system cost, is considered the most optimal solution for supporting waste-management system in Beijing.

Although the tradeoff between environmental factors and system costs is considered, the solutions under scenario 3 are the optimal scheme among all of the three pre-regulated scenarios.
However, scenario 3, with the highest system cost implies that the saving from lower system costs under scenarios 1 and 2 could not compensate the losing from environmental penalties, which include land recourse savings and utilization rate of the waste (e.g. most of the waste would be allocated to incinerating and composting facilities under scenarios 1 and 2). Even with high weight of public acceptance against incineration given the secondary pollution from the incineration), scenario 3 is the ideal scheme among the three pre-regulated scenarios. However the scheme under scenario 1 has the lowest diversion rate and net system cost and ranks the least favorable set among all the three pre-regulated scenarios. 6. Conclusions
Based on the system analysis of the waste-management system in Beijing, an inexact chance-constrained mixed-integer linear programming (ICCMILP) method is provided in this study. It can reflect the dynamic, interactive and uncertain characteristics of the solid waste-management system, and can address issues concerning waste diversion and landfill prolongation as deemed critical by the local authority. Three different scenarios are pre-regulated according to the practical situation and the Eleventh Five-year Plan of Beijing.

Violations of facility-capacity constraints are allowed under a range of significance levels, which reflect the tradeoff between system-cost and constraint-violation risk. The solutions represent a flexible range for decision makers of facility-expansion and waste-flow allocation. Decisions at a lower significance level would lead to higher system reliability and higher system cost; conversely, a desire for reducing system cost would result in an increased risk of violating the constraints. Among the solutions offered by the three scenarios, scenario 1 has the lowest system cost, but also the lowest diversion rate (i.e. utilization rate). However, the highest diversion rate may lead to the highest system cost. A landfill X  X  lifespan may be prolonged by 5 and 7 years under scenarios 2 and 3, respectively. The fuzzy MCDA method is applied for analyzing the optimal solutions among the three alternatives. With the consideration of landfill lifespan, system cost, diversion rate and public satisfaction, the result from the fuzzy MCDA method illustrates that scenario 3, with the highest diversion rate and system cost, is the most favorable scheme for supporting the waste-management system in Beijing. Scenario 1, with the lowest diversion rate and net system cost, is the least favorable solution among the different scenarios. Therefore, the result under scenario 3 is the most ideal waste-management scheme and presents a flexible range of solutions for waste-management decision makers.

Beijing is a typical big city in China, which has a large population with constantly increasing, rapid economic develop-ment and widely varying policies. In addition, the waste-flow system is similar to many other Chinese cities. Therefore, the developed model could be used as a general model. However, owing to the complexity of the waste-management system, the data required for defining different scenarios was extensive. Increasing the certainty of related data through further investiga-tion and verification would help to decrease the uncertainty of these proposed solutions. Moreover, extension of the ICCIMLP to a wide scope of waste-management problems for both residential and non-residential sectors would be an interesting topic that deserves further research effort.
