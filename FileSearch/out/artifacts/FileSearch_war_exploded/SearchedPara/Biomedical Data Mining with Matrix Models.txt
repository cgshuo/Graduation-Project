 In the last decade, advances in high-throughput technologies, growth of clinical data warehouses, and rapid accumulation of biomedical knowledge provided unprecedented opportunities and challenges to researchers in biomedical informatics. One distinct solution, to ef-ficiently conduct big data analytics for biomedical problems, is the application of matrix computation and factorization methods such as non-negative matrix factorization, joint matrix factorization, ten-sor factorization. Compared to probabilistic and information theo-retic approaches, matrix-based methods are fast, easy to understand and implement. In this tutorial, we provide a review of recent ad-vances in algorithms and methods using matrix and their potential applications in biomedical informatics. We survey various related articles from data mining venues as well as from biomedical infor-matics venues to share with the audience key problems and trends in matrix computation research, with different novel applications such as drug repositioning, personalized medicine, and electronic phenotyping.
 J.3 [ Life and Medical Sciences ]: Health; G.1.6 [ Optimization ] Matrix Models; Biomedical Data Mining
The recent years have witnessed a surge of interests on data min-ing with health and biomedical data, such as patient Electronic Health Records (EHR), drug development data, patient survey data, genetic data, etc. The hope is to derive insights from from data and these insights can later on be used to improve the quality of care delivery. Such data driven healthcare or medicine is believed to be one of the major trend on transforming healthcare.

Matrix model is one of the most popular models for data repre-sentation. For example, an image is naturally a matrix, a document can be represented as a bag-of-words vector and thus a collection of documents can be represented as a matrix (there are also some recent research representing a document as a words by segments matrix). Similarly, in healthcare domain, many data can also be represented as matrices. For example, patient EHR can be repre-sented as an event by time matrix, drug-drug interaction network can be represented by a symmetric square drug by drug matrix, drug-disease connections can be represented by a square disease by drug matrix, etc.

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce popular biomedical data resources and analytical problems, as well as how matrix models can be applied to solve those problems.
Before we go into the details on how those matrix based tech-nologies can be applied to social and healthcare informatics, we will first briefly overview the recent algorithmic advances on matrix based technologies, which include low-rank approximation, sparse learning, temporal learning and large-scale learning.
Rank deficiency is a very common assumption for data-driven analytics based on matrix based representations. This assumption is very reasonable as it has been validated on many different types of real world data including images, videos, text and networks, and it is because of this property of many real world data it becomes meaningful to perform computational analysis on those data. Oth-erwise the complexity of those data would be too high.
 One popular research area along this line is Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), which was originally proposed with the pur-pose of approximating a nonnegative matrix with the product of two low-rank nonnegative matrices. A lot of extensions of NMF have been proposed in recent years to fit different types of data, such as Tri-NMF, Convex NMF, Semi-NMF and Binary NMF. We will introduce each of them briefly and talk about their applications.
Another hot research area for low-rank approximation of data matrices we want to talk about is nuclear-norm approximation. In-stead of approximating the data matrix as the product of some small size matrices, this type of methods directly seek for a low-rank ma-trix that best matches the original data matrix on the observed el-ements and the objective is to directly minimize the rank of such approximation matrix. Because of the nonconvexity and nonconti-nuity of the matrix rank function, nuclear norm, which is the sum-mation of the singular values of a matrix, serves as a good surrogate to be optimized. We will briefly introduce the concept of nuclear norm and how to do the optimization, as well as the concept of truncated nuclear norm.
As most of the data are sparse in nature, sparse learning has been a hot research direction in recent years. The most popular setting for sparse learning is to learn a linear prediction model with sparse coefficients which best predicts the data outcomes. To en-force the sparsity on model parameters, we can construct differ-ent types of regularizers. In this part we will first introduce the various conventional sparse regularizers including ` 1 , ` net and group/fused LASSO penalty term. We will also introduce some newly developed structured sparsity regularizers such as tree and graph types. Finally we will mention one interesting problem. Basically what regularizer should we choose when we do sparse learning. For example, we may have two complete strategies to en-force the nonzero elements on the model parameters, one is group lasso type which set parameters corresponding to similar variables to nonzero, another is minimum redundancy type which want the variables with nonzero model parameters to be orthogonal to each other. Then what should we choose in this scenario?
Time is also one important factor for modern data analytics be-cause everything changes over time. In some applications it is insightful to explore the temporal regularities of the data. Also because of the data dependency between adjacent time points, it might be more effective and efficient to analyze the data matrix in one time point by incorporate the information of such data matrix in previous adjacent time points. In this part we want to introduce two technologies. One is convolutional matrix factorization which can detect the temporal evolving patterns of the data matrix. The other is online updating technologies which can efficiently update the analysis results of the data matrices in adjacent time points, in-cluding matrix perturbation theory and stochastic gradient descent.
In this section we will introduce several popular biomedical prob-lems and how can we utilize matrix based models to solve them.
Electronic phenotyping refers to the problem of learning patient phenotypes, or effective patient features, from electronic data. One of the major source for conducting electronic phenotyping research is patient Electronic Health Records (EHR). We will introduce sev-eral matrix based models proposed in recent years for electronic phenotyping including (1) one-side convolutional matrix factoriza-tion for detecting sequential patterns from patient EHR matrices; (2) a matrix completion model for detecting patient phenotypes as groups of raw EHR events; (3) a dictionary learning approach for identifying temporal phenotypes from patient EHR graphs.
Precision medicine is defined as recommendation of the right drug to the right patient at the right time. At its original definition, the patient condition is defined by their genetic information. How-ever, because of the emergence of rich observational information on the patients, their health condition can be described in a more comprehensive way. Also there is a direct relationship between precision medicine and collaborative filtering, thus we can expect matrix based models can be very useful here. We will introduce several recent works on (1) how to properly evaluate both patient and drug similarities from various information sources (e.g., with multiple kernel learning); (2) how to predict proper drugs to proper patients (e.g., with matrix completion).
Effective drug discovery and development involve the searching and data mining of large amounts of heterogeneous information from many sources covering the domains of chemistry, biology and pharmacology amongst others. In this part, we will mainly talk about utilizing matrix based models to solve the following practi-cal problems: (1) drug repositioning, which aims to identify novel therapeutic indications for existing drugs; (2) drug-drug interac-tion detection, which aims to identify potential interactions (e.g., adverse events) between drugs.
In this part we will introduce the challenges and opportunities for biomedical data mining with matrix models, including scalability, security and scalability. Fei Wang .
