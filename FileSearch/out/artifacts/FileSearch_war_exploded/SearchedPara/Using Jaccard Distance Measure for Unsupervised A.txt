 With the improvement of health awareness of people and the continuous development of science technology, HAR is increasingly used in intel ligent life, motion detection, and health care [1,2,3,4,5,6]. long -term, which can help the doctor to diagnose whether the user suffers from chronic diseases or not, sensors or camera -based computer vision system have been used to recognize human activities, but inconvenient for daily activity recognition. 
Alternatively, smartphone is very popular now and people can carry it anytime, anywhere. Most gyroscopes and so on. So smartphone has become an active field of research in the domain of perception and mobile computing. Within various sensors of smartphone, accelerometer is the most smartphone with a built -in triaxial accelerometer to collect five daily physical activities from five body positions, and the average classification accuracy of their method is about 96%. In the work of Yi He e t al. [8], three different sensors including accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetic sensor embedded in a selected from one hundred and forty features extracted from the sensors. Then, a hierarchical classifier Their work also shows that within the three embedded sensors, the accelerometer is the most significa nt sensor for activity recognition.

Usually, raw time series data cannot be applied on HAR directly, feature extraction methods have to been used to produce a new data representation (called features) from the raw acceleration data before divided into two types: time -domain features and frequency -domain features. Time -domain features which include features from both time -domain and frequency-domain are also used in HAR [11] . In the traditional approaches to HAR, standar d supervised classification methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K -Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, etc. , have been used after feature different activities, which include walking, running, ascending stairs, desc ending stairs, cycling, driving and remaining inactive using cell phone sensors and have evaluated a number of classification methods including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN and SVM. The Decision Tree classifier outperforms the other classifiers, and on average it produces a true positive rate of 95.2%.
 All the above studies are using supervised classification methods to perform activity recognition. previous work [14] , an unsupervised method is proposed for HA R with time -domain features extracted from the data collected using smartphone accelerometers. It is shown that the unsupervised method is methods, usually classify data based on the similarities between the data points. So the accuracy of the unsupervised classification methods can be greatly affected by the distance measure (or similarity measure) applied on the feature vectors. Although the Euclidean dist ance measure is the most high -dimensional space due to the curse of dimensionality. I n many cases, t he normalization of features measure can be avoided by using the Jaccard distance measure instead. Jaccard distance measures the degree of the overlap between two sets of nonnegative feature values, so the normalizatio n of features is not needed. Jaccard distance not only considers the differences between the feature vectors, but also high -dimensional space. I n this work, the Jaccard distance measure is applied to HAR for the first time as far as we know , and the superiority of the Jaccard distance to the Euclidean distance is shown by the experiments. Recently, position and orientation independent activity recognition using smartphone accelerometers has al so been investigated. Lin Fan et al. [16] use resultant acceleration to eliminate the effects of the phone orientations. A feature set including seven time -domain features and three frequency -domain descending stairs. The classification accuracy produced by their method is 80.29%. Fen Miao et al. [9] smartphone for HAR. The magnitude of linear acceleration combined with signals collected from gyroscope sensor and magnetic sensor are used. Then six time -domain statistical features are extracted for recognizing five typical physical activi ties which include staying still, walking, jogging, ascending HAR using smartphones without firm attachment to the body. In this work, orientation -inde pendent HAR is realized by using the resultant acceleration data from the smartphones too . 
Many clustering methods have been applied on unsupervised HAR. I n the work of I . P. Machado et features. Four clustering methods, including K -Means, Spectral Clustering, Mean Shift and Affinity Propagation (AP) based on Euclidean distance are used to distinguish different activities. In the subject -independent context, the accuracy rate of K -Means clustering reaches 88.75%, while the accuracy rate of other clustering algorithms ranges from 30% to 45%. In the case of subject -dependent context, the accuracy rate of K -Means clustering reaches 99.29% and the accuracy of other clustering methods ranges from 53% to 93.96%. In work of A.L.G. N. Gomes [ 18 ], K -Means, Mini Batch K-Means, AP, Mean Shift, DBSCAN, Spectral Clustering, and Ward -Linkage have been applied for HAR. They have found that the Spectral Clustering has produced t he best results with an accuracy rate of 89.1%  X  8.8%. R . Amitha et al . [19] have proposed a system using Naive Bayes classifier combined Clustering, K-Medo ids, and three commonly used hierarchical clustering methods , including Single -Linkage, Ward -Linkage, and Average -Linkage are used for HAR. 3.1 Data Collection UCI dataset includes triaxial acceleration data of walking, running, ascending stairs, descending stairs, invalid values. So only the data of t he rest 17 su bjects are used in our experiments.
 them was instructed to carry a Samsung Galaxy SIII smartphone in their front pants pocket while ascending stairs, descending stairs, sitting and standing. The acceleration data with a sampling frequency of 50Hz are collected. 3.2 Feature Extraction with 50% overlap is employed to divide the time series into smaller time windows. For the UCI dataset the window of 2.56 seconds is used, while for our dataset, the w indow of 5.12 seconds is used. Similar as previous works [ 21] , the magnitude of the acceleration, A 3a , is used for feature extraction, which is insensitive to the orientation and position of the devices. A 3a can be represented as: 
The magnitudes of the acceleration date within each sliding window are then used for feature extraction. Three feature extraction methods based on frequency -domain, time -domain and mixed -domain are used in the experiments, which are explained in details below : Inter -Quart ile -Range. Figueira et al. [11] are extracted, which includes Root Mean Square (RMS), Median Absolute Deviation (MAD), Standard Dev iation, Spectral Roll On, Mean Power Spectrum, Max power Spectrum. defined as: where winLen represents the length of the window. Then FFT is applied to the data of each window. In order to improve the frequency resolution and reduce spectral leakage, the magnitudes of the Fourier coefficients are convolved with a hamming window of size 5. Then the final results of each window are used as feature vectors. 3.3 Jaccard Distance Measure x similarity coefficient is defined as: and their Jaccard distance is defined as:
The value of the Jaccard distance ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 represents the identical sets, while 0 extraction methods are all greater than or equ al to 0, Jaccard distance can be readily applied. 4.1 Design of the Experiments To compare the effectiveness of the Euclidean distance and the Jaccard distance in unsupervised HAR, the following procedures of the experiments are executed (as shown in Fig. 1) : standing and sitting; overlap ; acceleration; distance; clustering methods which include Spectral Cluster, Single -Linkage, Ward -Linkage, Average -Linkage, and K -Medoids, and then measure the clustering results using FM -index. 4.2 Evaluat ion Criterion Both C -index [22] and FM -index [23] are used to evaluate the experimental results. C-index is used to measure the compatibility of the distance measure with the actual class labels . A smaller C -index value indicates a better compatibility wher e the data points have s maller distances within the same class and greater distance s between different classes. The C-index is defined as: indicates a better compati bility of the distance measure with the actual class labels.

The FM -index is used to evaluate the clustering results produced by a clustering method. The different. For FM -index, a larger value means a better similarity between the clustering result and the actual result.
 4.3 Experimental Results distance measures. The results are shown in Table 1. From Table 1, it can be seen that, for 60 out of all distance . 
Based on the distances computed using the two distance measures , five different clustering methods which include S pectral Cluster, Single -Linkage, Ward -Linkage, Average -Linkage, and K -Medoids are used to cluster the dataset. T he FM -index is then used to measure the clustering results . Table 2 show s the FM -ind ices produced using different combinations of the three feat ure extraction methods, the five FM -indices of all the subjects in each dataset are averaged.

It can be seen f rom Table 2 that , regardless of which combination of the feature extraction method s show the superiority of the Jaccard distance measure over the Euclidean distance measure for feature extraction method s, except the result of using Single -Linkage on our dataset. This indicates that the frequency-domain features are more effective than the other two features for unsupervised HAR . recognition, the FM -ind ices produced using the five clustering methods are averaged for each combination of the distance measure and the feature extraction method s. The results are shown i n Fig . 2. It can be seen that the FM -index produced using Jaccard distance is better than that produced using Euclidean distance regardless of which feature extraction method is used, while the FM -index produced using the frequency-domain feature extraction method is better than that produced using the other two feature extraction methods. superiority of the Jaccard distance measure over the Euclidean distance measure for unsupervised HAR. feature extractio n method and the mixed -domain feature extraction method for unsupervised HAR using the proposed method. Future work includes applying the Jaccard distance measure on more datasets and improving the feature extraction methods.
