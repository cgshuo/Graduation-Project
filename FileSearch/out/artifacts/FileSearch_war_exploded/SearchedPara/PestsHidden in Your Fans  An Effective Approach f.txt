 With the development of Web 2.0, people would like to share opi n ions on the Web, which are very helpful for other users to make decision. Some of the users could a l-ways provide more valuable advice, and they gradually have more powerful influence to other members in the specific e -community, and further to the whole e -society. For example, Gangnam Style unusually drew the attention from the world i n the past few months . Till November 2012, its MV uploaded in Youtube has been watched almost 8.4 hundred million times. H ow did Gang nam Style turn into a success? To trace backward, we found that opinion leaders gave most of the effort on this. At first, the click -t hrough rate was poor. But then, some artists who have strong calling power, like Britney Spears , Katy Perry , promo t ed it keenly in Twitter. Influenced by them, whole wor ld. Gangnam Style became famous incred i bly. It is clear that the opinion leader is the key of success.

The formal definition of opinion leader is that people who are i nfluential me m bers of a community, group, or society to w hom others turn for advice, opi nions, and views. A user is consider ed as an opinion leader when he involves the following fa c-tors 1 :  X  E xpression of values  X  P rofessional competence  X  N ature of his social network
Due to the commercial factors of opinion leader, the study of opinion leader foc u s-es on mining the commercial value of a given opinion leader, such as product sugge s-tion, advertising cam paign, and so on, while ignore how to discover opinion leaders. A c cording to our preliminary study, there exists some related work on opinion leader i dentification, e.g. Central Policy Unit. [1] Unfortunately , most of the opinion leader analysis utilize s manual methods for discovering opinion leaders, rather than carry ing out automatically. Manual methods may be work in Web 1.0 era with limited portal tomatically opinion leader discovery takes only the nature of the social network into shi ps betwee n users express supporting opi nions . For instance,  X  Sister Phoenix  X  (  X   X  ) has a great amount of fans and relations on Weibo , but most of her fans oppose her. It is very often that the relation ship between an opinion leader and a non -opinion your fans or replies will improve the performance of opinion leader ident i fication .
In this paper, we target to identify the opinion leaders on social media . We dis co v-er an opini on leader by accounting for all the three factors in the definition of opi n ion leaders. We pr esent a 2 -step approach for discovering opinion leaders : we first gene r-ate a group of candidate/potential opinion leaders according to the expression of va l-ues and professional competence by analyzing the profile and the post content of the users. Specifically, we propose two categories of features to (1) describe t he user profile which will help detect the professional area and measure his/her competence; (2) analy ze the content of his/her posts together with the replies and the comments which will help determine the value of the expression, e.g., get rid of the pests e x-press ing opposite opinion s to refine the social network . We then integra t e the pote n-tial opinion leaders into a graph -based model to measure its nature of social networks.
In order to investigate the performance of our proposed method, w e also conduct several experiments based on the real data, which was collec t ed from Twitter about the UK General El ection in 2010 [3] . We investigate the contribution of different fe a-tures, including content -based, user -based and linkage -based for identifying opinion leaders. A compar ative experiment is conducted and the experimental results showed that our pr o posed app roach outperform the state -of -the -art linkage based method. The rest of th is paper is organized as follows: we will review the related works in covery. We evaluate our appro ach in Section 4. Finally, we will conduct the concl u-sion and su g gest future works in Section 5. Most of the previously work about opinion leader focused on how to utilize its co m-mercial value, such as m arketing r esearch , product sampling, ret ailing/personal sel l-determined manually, and the data was not open to public. 
Until the recent decade, with the explosion of information , automatically discove r-ing opin ion leader attracted more and more attentions .

Thomas, et al., proposed analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, which is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions. [ 7 ] According to each shortlisted user, assorted factors should be considered. Thus, the AHP provides a comprehensive and rational framework for quantifying its factors in order to relate those factors and evaluate the solutions, which mean the choices of opinion leaders in this case. An AHP hierarchy consists of an ov erall goal, a group of alternatives for down into many levels as the p roblem r e quires. 
Laclav i k , et al., proposed a method for opinion leader identification based on the r elationship n etwork . [ 8 ] The y suggested to determin e the communication relationships between users by relationship mining methods. The extracted users and its relatio n-ship network form ed a social network c ould be then represented as graphs. The resul t-ing g raph wa s analyzed by determining key figures for the position of single users and for the overall structure of the network. In this way , opinion leaders could be ident i-fied.

Centrality analysis approach was proposed to measure the degree of activist  X  s co n-n ection with others. [ 9 ] The more the connections were , the more the influences of that activist on others. Opin ion leaders c ould be listed out based on the degree of influence and a c tiveness. Social network analysis provide d a number of key f eature s which d escribe d the structure of the entire network. For analyzing opinions, the key figures density, co n nectivity, and closeness centralization we re especially relevant. Density measure d the connection of a network and is an indicator for communication within th e ne t work.

In summary , all of the above approaches only focus on analyzing the relationship between the users. They make use of the concept of tree structure or graph stricter to illustrate the influence brought by the opinion leaders. They concern the lev els, width and size which can show the structural information of opinion leaders. However, structure -based methods only show the number of people replied or r e tweeted his or her post s but not going to consider the content of the tweets , i.e. opi n ions . Th is kind of content of a tweet can illustrate whether it supports the idea of the previous posts or whether they are talking about the same topic. If we find that the r e pliers do not agree with the viewpoints of the previous tweet, then this tweet cannot be c ounted as an effect of influence in his social network . Therefore, in this paper, we will account for the content -based features for opinion leader disco v ery . In this section, we will present our 2 -step approach for opinion leader discovery. It is intuitively that the best way of identify the website leader is based on the analysis of relationships of websites where the link between two websites only carry  X  X uppor t-ing X  meaning. However, for opinion leader discover y from social media , the link b e tween two users may indicate an  X  X pposite X  meaning or  X  X one X  . In other words, the hidden in the relations carry opposite opinions . T here fore, we suggest to ide n tify the opinion leaders by considering  X  opinion  X  and propose a 2 -step approach where a ca n-didate opinion leader set is firstly generated by considering the factor of sentiment and then implemented into a graph -based model for final ident i fication . 3.1 Potential Opinio n Leader Generation Recall that a user is consider ed as an opinion leader when he /she involves the follo w-network . We propose a number of features to describe the first two fa c tors in this subsection and put them into SVM [12] to generate a candidate opinion leader set. Then we i m plement the results into graph -based model for analyzing the n ature of its social network to discover opinion leaders .  X  Professional Competence
Since our target is to discover opinion leader from social media , we take Twitter as an example for further description. We list some statisti c s related to the users  X  profe s-sion from his/her profile . T his category of features represents the nature of user  X  s pro fe s sional competence shown in Table 1 .
  X  Value of Expression ge ther with its comments/replies . Accordingly, the category of c ontent -based features is proposed to help us find out the viewpoint and argument of a comment as shown in Table 2 . 
To understand more about the attitude of users towards their opinion leaders, the r eply  X  s content is important. D oes the user support or oppose the viewpoint of the opinion leader? In our method, we utilize Sentiwordnet 2 to help us analyze the opi n-ion of the tweet. Sentiwordnet is an open source which consists of 17,370 negative words an d 18,157 positive words. There is a score assigned to each individual sent i-ment word to ind i cate the positive or the negative strength of the sentiment word . [16] (In this paper, the supporting opinion and opposite opinion are also referred as pos i-tive opin ion and neg a tive opinion, respectively.)
For simplicity, we just measure the opinionatedness in two naive ways: calculating the scores of the sentiment words appearing in the tweet; counting the number of sent i ment words. T hen we sum up the score or the se ntiment word count of a tweet to indicate the attitude ( posi tive or negative ) .

We then put both categories of features into Supporting Vector Machine (SVM) to generate candidate opinion leaders. 3.2 Opinion Leader Identification After we generate the candidat e opinion leaders, w e then integrate them into a graph -based model to rank and generate the final opinion lea d ers.
Our proposed graph mode l is based on HITS algorithm , which distinguishes the u s-ers into hubs and authorities . An authority represents a candidate opinion leader, no t-ed by c , while a hub indicates th e non -candidate user , noted by u . For each individual u , it has links to many au thorities. An authority c j would have many hubs linking to it. The hub scores and authority scores are computed in an iterative way. Fig . 1 gives the graph model represe n tation of the HITS model. 
For our purpose, the non -candidate layer is considered as h ubs and the candidate layer authorities. If a non -candidate user posts a reply or comment to support the opi n ion of candidate opinion leader , there will be an edge between them. In Fig . 1 , we can see that the candidate opinion leader that has links from ma ny non -candidate u s-ers can be assigned a high weight to denote a strong social network . On the contr a ry , if a candidate opinion leader has few links from the Hubs , the score is low, which will result in a low ranking. Each edge is associated wi th a weight w ij denoting the contr i-bution of u i to the candidate opinion leader c j . The weight w ij is computed by the co n tribution of non -candidate users .

Different from existing approaches, we c onsider sentiment factor for opinion lea d-er discovery. We divide the link s between users into supporting (positive) ones and opposite (negative) ones , and regard those positive links are valuable in its social network. Therefore, w e filter out the pests fr om follower with links expressing opp o-site opin ions more than supporting ones in the first step . We then compute the weight of the edge by only accounting for pos i tive links.

For computation of the final scores, the initial scores of all candidate opinion lea d-ers are set to 1/N , and non -candidate are set to 1/M . The above iterative steps are then used to compute the new scores until convergence. Usually the convergence of the iteration algorithm is achieved when the difference betwee n the scores computed at two successive iterations for any nodes falls below a given threshold [ 13 ] [14] [17] . In our model, we use the authority scores as the total scores. The opinion leaders are then ranked b ased on the total scores. 4.1 Experiment al Setup Dataset The tweets data we used in th is paper were collected using the Twitter Streaming API include the mention of political parties such as Labour, Co n servative , Tory1, etc., the mention of candidates such as Brown, Cameron, Clegg, etc., the use of the hash tags such as #election2010, #Labour etc., and the use of ce r tain words such as election. The corpus contains around 919,662 unique tweets and 68,620 users. We also collec t-ed the following l inks of all the users.

According to the Twitter setting, data can only be revealed at most one -week qua n-tity each time. Thus, data sample will be separated randomly into one -week sized in this case for afterward analysis in o rder to fit the circumstance , which data is extrac t-ed automatically in the future . Thus, t he dataset for analysis contains around 44,391 unique tweets and 18,713 users .
 Annotation We have also done the clustering for the data before the annotation. T here are 4 su b-groups such as conservative party, labour party, liberal democrat party and others. For each subgroup, we have annotated the opinion leaders in th e subgroup manually while two out of three members in our group agree that the user is opinion leader , which mean more than half of the group members agree, then the user is opinion leader. And it is the majority rule to identify the opinion leaders manually . The Kappa coe f-fi cient [18] indicating inter -annotator agreement was 0. 82 3 6 for the binary classifica tion. The conflict l a bels from the two annotators were resolved by a third annotator. F inally, t here are 129 opinion leaders annotated in the training dataset.
In our experiment, t he data is divided into five folds and four of them are trai n ing data and the one left is testing data . In order to investigate the performance of 2 -step approach, we compare our proposed method with the linkage -based approach, which achieved the best run. Beside, we have proposed several categories of features to ide n tify potentia l opinion leaders in Section 3, which are co n tent -based and user -based mentioned above. In order to investigate the effectiveness of each category of features, we also tried different combination of fe a ture sets.
 B aseline W e choose linkage -based method as the bas e line, which achieved best performance among linkage -based methods [15] . Metrics We utilize p recision r ecall and f -value as our evaluation metrics . The precision is intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample that is negative. The recall is intuitively the ability of the classif i er to find all the positive samples. The F -value can be interpreted as a weighted harmonic mean of the precision and r e call. A measure reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0. 3 4.2 Experim ental R esult The overall performance of different approaches is shown in Table 3 . We use SVM+C to denote Content -based feature , SVM+U means user -based feature, and SVM+ ALL stands for adding them all.

The experimental result s show ed that the 2 -step approac h with our proposed fe a-tures outperformed the baseline. E specially, when all the features were taken into consideration, the F -value wa s the highest which identified 106 opinion leaders and achieved around 8% improvement over the baseline. Moreover , there more than 10 fake opinion leaders identified by the baseline due to their well social network but mainly negative comments .

We further compar ed the features in different categor ies , the co n tent -based features were more important than user -based features, w hich could identify 94 opinion lea d-ers . Approach Precision Recall F -value Baseline 0.7322 0.6285 0.6763 SVM+C 0.8032 0.6345 0.7089 SVM+U 0.7 74 0 0.6316 0.6955
SVM+ALL 0.818 0 0.6351 0.7150
We further investigate the performance of each individual feature of content -based category, and the results were shown in Table 4. 
It is clear that SVM+ratio achieved the best run, which demonstrated that the fe a-ture of pos. or cons. ratio was the most effective way to decrease the impact of rel a-tionship carrying negative opinion comparing with the bas e line . Besides, according to our analysis of the experimental results, one would like to express opinions t o attack others during the Election rather than post replies for supporting. As a result, if a ca n-didate opinion leader has high pos. ratio, it is probable to be an opinion leader.

The main difference from traditional website leader is that the link of social network doesn  X  t always mean supporting. A p est link is likely to exist wit h negative opinions between users. We , therefore, design a 2 -step model by taking into consideration of the key factors of opi n ion leaders, the value of expression, the professional competence, and the nature of social ne t wor ks.

Specifically, a candidate opinion leader set is generated by utiliz ing the user profile to detect the professional area and measur e user  X  s competence; by analyzing the co n-second step , a HITS -like graph is constructed based on the potential opinion leaders to rank the opinion leaders.

In conclusion, 1. W e propose a set of useful fea tures to describe the key factors of opinion leaders , which is proved to be effective fo r candidate opinion leader generation ; 2. A graph -based model is devised for ranking opinion leaders , which decreases the impact of links with negative opinions ; 3. A 2 -step approach for opinion leader identification is presented from the perspe c-tive o f view of opinion leader definition ; 4. Several experiments were conducted and the results showed the effectiveness of our proposed 2 -step approach, which could achieve 8% i mprovement over the baseline . 5.2 Future Work In the future , we will continue our research on opinio n leader discovery in the follo w-ing directions: 1. Develop a unified model for opinion leader discovery by considering information di f fu sion ; 2. Implement the fine -grained opinion analysis into content analysis, e.g. opinion ta r-get identification [19] ; 3. C lassify t he comments into different categories so as to build up the relationship between comments. 4. Besides Tweets, we would like to move forward to other data from different la n-guages of social media, like Weibo, My Space, etc.
