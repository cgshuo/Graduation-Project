 1. Introduction
Presence of uncertainties is unavoidable in the real life engineering and mechanical systems. Thus, uncertainty quantifi-cation gains considerable attention from many scientific disciplines. In the context of structural engineering, there may be uncertainties associated with the model parameters or the model itself due to mathematical simplifications which have remarkable effect on system responses (e.g., material properties, connection rigidities, soil parameters). Nevertheless, measure-ment noises are inevitably involved in the experimental studies.
In order to make reliable estimation for the system output and assess the system reliability, some uncertainty quantification techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation, mean centered perturbation method, interval arithmetic and fuzzy sets are proposed to quantify uncertainties in engineering problems. Detailed discussion on these methods can be found in Khodaparast (2010) , Marwala (2010) , Henriques (2008) .
Uncertainty quantification methods can be separated into two groups: Probabilistic methods and non-probabilistic methods.
Probabilistic methods are based on the probability theory in which the uncertain parameters are considered as random para-meters. The frequency of occurrences of these random parameters is given by probability density functions. The MSC, perturbation methods and the asymptotic integral method can be classified as probabilistic methods. However, the interval arithmetic and the fuzzy set theory are in the class of non-probabilistic methods since no assumption is made about the probability distribution of uncertain variables.
 gation in engineering systems using probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods. Adhikari and Friswell M I (2007) proposed two perturbation based methods in order to evaluate the statistics of modal parameters of structural systems. Degrauwe et al. (2010) presented an interval analysis method improved by affine arithmetic to reduce the overestimation of uncertainty on the results due to dependency problem. A finite element method for fuzzy structures is proposed by Zhenyu and Qiu (2002) . They transferred the fuzzy variable into random variables using the information entropy and used the perturbation finite element method to calculate the statistics of structural response. Some alternative fuzzy arith-metic and fuzzy finite element methods are presented by many authors in order to tackle with both epistemic and irreducible 2008 ; Huang and Li, 2005 ; Chen and Rao, 1997 ). However, there are limited numbers of studies where the uncertainty propagation techniques are applied to inverse problems such as the Finite Element Model Updating (FEMU).

The FEMU is a very attractive technique to assess the structural integrity. The goal of the FEMU is to identify some imprecise model parameters such as material prop erties, boundary conditions and beam column connections by minimizing an objective function which involves the differences between the experimental and numerical modal parameters. The damage in civil engineering structures can also be identified by the FEMU with the assumption that the structural damage usually causes a d ecrease in structural stiffness ( Yu and Chung, 2012 , Teughels, 2007 ; Bakir et al., 2007 , 2008 ).
However, there are always erro rs in the measured data and the
In order to identify the propagatio n of the uncertainties in updating parameters through FEMU, probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods can be used. The distributions or the range of updating parameters in the parameter space can be estimated from the measured variability of the output data such as modal parameters.
This is called the stochastic finite element modal updating. Hua et al. (2008) presented a perturbation based stochastic finite element model updating method in which they use a gradient based iterative method in order to determine the mean values and the coefficient of variations of the updated parameters due to the uncertainties in material properties and measurement data.
They compare the results considering the correlation between updating parameters and the modal parameter with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Khodaparast et al. (2008) adapted a similar method and proposed two perturbation based methods in order to determine the first and the second statistical moments of updating parameters. They investigate the influence of correlation between the updated and the modal parameters on the results of a 3 degree-of-freedom simple s ystem and truss structure. Moaveni and
Conte (2009) presented a study in order to quantify and analyze uncertainties in damage detection problem using finite element model updating strategy. The aim of their study was to investigate the influence of the uncertainties in modal parameters, spatial density of measurement and the mesh size of the FE model in the damage detection results. They perform a gradient based optimiza-tion method to minimize the objective function which includes the residuals of experimental and n umerical modal parameters for different combinations of uncer tainty source. An interval based model updating strategy with irreducible uncertainty is proposed by Khodaparast et al. (2011) . The Kriging predictor was chosen as meta-model in order to estimate t he bounds of output parameters efficiently. Govers and Link (2010) used statistical properties of multiple sets of experimental data for stochastic FEMU. They presented a method to adjust the design parameter means and related covariance matrix using the extended version of classical gradientbasediteration.Afuzzylogicsystemisdevelopedby
Chandrashekhar and Ganguli (2009) to identify the damage in a cantilever beam in the presence of measurement noise. The con-nection between probability theory and the fuzzy logic was also addressed in their studies.

In the present study, a fuzzy finite element model updating methodology is presented in order to examine the uncertainty propagation in the updating parameters. General framework is defined to make FFEMU procedure applicable to large-scale engineering problems. The inverse FFEMU problem is considered as an optimization problem. Uncertainties in modal parameters are represented by the fuzzy numbers and then fuzzy arithmetic operations are carried out in interval arithmetic sense using a -cut procedure. Practical calculation of interval bounds of the response parameters inside the optimization loop using Taylor series expansion which facilitate the fuzzy updating are explained in detail. An objective function is constructed including the interval bounds of the experimental and numerical modal parameters. An efficient hybrid version of GA and PSO is proposed and used to obtain the global optimum of the given objective function at each a -cut level. By this way, nonlinearity between input and out parameters is captured. Calculation of interval modal parameters would be very challenging task in some cases especially when the input X  X utput relation is not monotonic. In this study, it is shown that two FE calculations are needed to find the lower and upper bounds for each response parameter by using the information obtained from a preliminary analysis in the input parameter domain. Finally, the proposed FFEMU procedure is compared with the MCS results. A three storey and two bay frame structure is used to verify the results obtained by FFEMU. The results show that the updated uncertain parameters obtained by FFEMU are found to be in good agreement with MCS results. Nevertheless, FFEMU requires less computational time while the MCS is computationally expen-sive and may be impractical for large numerical models. It should also be noted that this method can be applied any engineering problems in order to quantify input uncertainties from output uncertainties as long as the input X  X utput relation can be identified by an preliminary analysis in the parameter space. 2. Fuzzy sets, numbers and arithmetic operations
The fuzzy set theory introduced by Zadeh (1965) has gained an increasing interest in many engineering fields. The fuzzy set theory is a very powerful method which is very capable in quantifying uncertainties in engineering problems. The method describes linguistic uncertainty, incomplete or imprecise infor-mation and vagueness in a non-probabilistic manner. A fuzzy set is given in Eq. (1) . ~ A  X  x , m ~ A  X  x  X  9 x E X , m ~ A  X  x  X  A  X  0 , 1  X  1  X  in Eq. (1) , m ~ A  X  x  X  is the membership function of the fuzzy set which expresses the degree to which a sample x belongs to the set ~ A . A fuzzy number is a fuzzy set which satisfy the following conditions. (1) ~ A is normal, (2) ~ A is convex, (3) There is exactly one x A R with m ~ A  X  x  X  X  1, (4) The membership function is at least piecewise continuous. Actually, there is infinite number of possible sets that satisfy these conditions. However, triangular, trapezoidal, and Gaussian type fuzzy sets are the prevalent fuzzy numbers in applied fuzzy arithmetic.

The a -cut of the fuzzy set ~ A is given in Eq. (2) . The a -cut procedure is frequently used in applied fuzzy arithmetic. Some other basic definitions and notations for fuzzy sets and numbers can be found in Hanss (2005) .
 A  X  x E X 9 m ~ A  X  x  X  Z a  X  2  X 
The goal of the fuzzy arithmetic is to determine the membership functions of the system outputs on the basis of given membership functions of the system inputs. Zadeh (1965) proposed the well-known extension principle in order perform fuzzy arithmetical variable by Eq. (3) . However, the extension principle requires extensive computational effort as the number of input variable increases. The required function evaluations in this case is d d is discrete values for each fuzzy number and n is the number of variables.  X  y  X  X  sup
Another method for fuzzy arithmetic operations is the transforma-tion method ( Hanss 2005 ). The method is applicable for the analysis of systems with uncertain model parameters. Transformation method is available in two forms: the reduced and general transformation methods. The first method is applicable for monotonic and the latter is applicable for non-monotonic functions. However, the reduced transformation method is required 2 n function evaluations. This number increases for the general transformation methods and it may not be practical to be applied into problems that have much more input variables than a certain number.

A fuzzy number can be represented by interval variables using
However, calculation of the output intervals using classic interval interval arithmetic is the so-called dependency problem. The depen-dency problem causes the results to be overly conservative. In order to circumvent the dependency problem, affine arithmetic is proposed by Degrauwe et al. (2010) for fuzzy finite element calculations.
Optimization methods can also be used for fuzzy arithmetic calcula-needed in order to obtain the correct bounds of the fuzzy variables while the mapping function ~ y a is multimodal. ~ y  X  f ~ x a  X  X  2
The G a D algorithm proposed by Degrauwe (2007) can also be used when the number of uncertain variables is high. Some other novel methods can be found in Massa et al. (2008) and Farkas et al. (2010) for the analysis of variability and uncertainty in engineering problems by the use of fuzzy finite element method. 3. Fuzzy finite element model updating
In this section, FFEMU is briefly explained and a flowchart is presented. In deterministic FEMU, an objective function is presented in a nonlinear least square sense. This objective function consists of the experimental and the numerical modal parameters in which the differences between modal parameters have to be minimized in order to obtain the updated parameters.
One of the most challenging tasks in FEMU applications is to find a robust optimization technique so as to obtain the global minimum of the objective function. Another problem is the measurement noise and the inaccurate finite element models.
Due to measurement noise and inaccurate initial finite element models, some updating parameters may falsely be identified.
Increasing model accuracy and sensitive measurements may help to improve the updating results. However, these efforts might be very expensive and dispensable. The probabilistic and the non-probabilistic (fuzzy) models are very useful to approximate the current structural behavior using uncertain measurement data and finite elements models. The presented FFEMU procedure can be used to propagate the uncertainties in measurements through model parameters.
 that is adopted in this study is a challenging task. Thus, the number of published studies that deal with the inverse fuzzy finite element method or FFEMU is very low. As mentioned in the first section, current studies are mostly related with forward fuzzy finite element analysis which is relatively easy to tackle with. A novel inverse fuzzy arithmetic method is proposed by
Haag et al. (2010) . They use fuzzy arithmetic to identify the fuzzy model parameters of fluid-filled piping system. Transformation method is used to calculate the bounds of the interval model parameters. However, in their method optimization is additionally required to reduce the resulting uncertainty due to underdeter-mism. Nevertheless, transformation method is expensive when the number of input parameters is too high. Degrauwe et al. (2009) proposed a method called G a D algorithm for uncertainty quanti-fication by means of fuzzy numbers. This method works well when the derivatives of the evaluated function with respect to the uncertain variables are available analytically. Unfortunately, in most cases, this might not be possible. In the presented method, an efficient global optimization technique is proposed which does not require any derivative information except in the deterministic case. Additionally, as opposed to the conventional transformation and vertex methods, only two function evaluations are required in order to calculate the interval bounds of the response variables.
Nevertheless, these calculations are approximated by the Taylor series with high accuracy which leads to reduction the computa-tional complexity as explained in next sections. These features enable the proposed FFEMU method to be applied to more complex problems. The FFEMU procedure is explained in Fig. 1 .
In Fig. 1 , m is the number of a -cut levels, N ij and N ij lower and upper bounds of the updating parameters, y I is the interval updating parameter vector which belongs to each a -cut shape vector, respectively. As apparent in Fig. 1 , the updating process is carried out at each a -cut level of the fuzzy parameters.
An objective function which will be defined in the next section is constructed by interval arithmetic sense and minimized using a
GA method improved by PSO algorithm. This algorithm will also be mentioned in Section 6 . After carrying out updating procedure and obtaining the bounds for the updated parameters at each a -cut level, the fuzzy parameters are obtained by combining all interval valued updating parameters. 4. Formulation of objective function
In FEMU, an optimization problem is set up in which an objective function has to be minimized. This objective function generally involves differences between the numerical and experi-mental modal parameters. In this paper, an objective function is constructed using differences between the interval natural fre-quencies and the mode shapes as given in Eqs. (5) X (12) . f h
I  X  r h I T W r h I  X  r h I T W r h I  X  5  X  h  X  X  h , h  X  6  X  r h r h r h r h r h
I  X  f r h
I  X  f in Eqs. (5) X (12) , h I is the interval updating parameter vector, l j h I and l j h I are lower and upper bounds of the analytical eigenvalues, l e j and l e j are lower and upper bounds of the experimental eigenvalues, f j h I , f j h I and f e j upper and lower bounds of j th analytical and experimental eigenvectors, respectively. In Eq. (5) , the weighting matrix W can be used to make all modal parameter residuals as the same order.

As apparent from the above equations, for each a -cut level, the objective function is given in a constrained interval arithmetic sense. However, additional constraints are needed in order to obtain convex output membership functions. Hence, lower bounds of the updating parameters at j  X  1th a -cut level must be smaller than the updating parameters at the j th a -cut level. For the upper bounds of the updating parameters, the opposite is true. These additional constraints are given in Eqs. (13) and (14) . y y 5. Computation of interval natural frequencies and mode shapes
Fuzzy calculations can be carried out by transforming fuzzy sets into interval sets. At each a -cut level, bounds of the variables can be calculated and then the final fuzzy outputs are obtained by combining all interval calculation results. In FFEMU, the interval modal parameters must be calculated by use of any fuzzy or interval arithmetic technique at each of the FEMU iterations defined in Section 3 . If heuristic global optimization techniques are used in FFEMU in order to obtain more accurate and reliable results, computational burden increases with the increase in the variable numbers and the size of the population. Hence, there is a need to compute the interval modal parameters practically and accurately at each FFEMU iteration.

The natural frequencies behave monotonic in the interval of variation of the updating parameters if the system mass and rigidity matrices are not nonlinear functions of the updating parameters. However, the system eigenvectors do not behave monotonically whether the system matrices are linear or non-linear functions of the updating parameters. These statements might be validated by Eqs. (15) X (17) . As apparent in Eqs. (15) and (16) , the sign of the eigenvalue derivatives must remain unchanged within the region of the variation of the updating parameter. In Eq. (18) , signs of a ik terms change in the summation due to changes in the sign of the denominator x 2 i x 2 k that the sign of the eigenvectors generally is not constant in the variation interval of the updating variables. @ x @ h @ x @ h @ f @ h in Eqs. (15) and (16) , y j is the j th model parameter, o natural frequency, f i is the i th mode shape vector, K and M are stiffness and mass matrices, respectively.
 5.1. Computation of the interval natural frequencies
If the natural frequencies are the linear functions of the mass and stiffness matrices, then the natural frequencies behave monotonically in the variation range of the updating parameters and can be computed simply by Eqs. (19) X (21) . More detailed description and some different solution theorems for interval eigenvalues can be found in ( Sim et al., 2007 ); Qiu and Wang (2005) . l  X  l , l K  X  K ref 1 y , K  X  K ref 1 y  X  20  X  M  X  M ref 1 y , M  X  M ref 1 y  X  21  X 
Eqs. (19) X (21) show that the interval natural frequencies take their minimum values when the updated parameters take their maximum values and vice versa. Thus, in each FFEMU iteration, two finite element model evaluations are required to compute the lower and upper bounds of the natural frequencies. 5.2. Computation of the interval mode shapes
As discussed in previous sections, the interval mode shapes generally show non-monotonic behavior in the definition range of the updated parameters. Hence, vertex methods and the reduced transformation method should not be used to compute the interval bounds of the mode shapes. In this case, optimization methods or general transformation methods might be used in order to obtain the true interval bounds of the mode shape components. However, inclusion of such methods into FFEMU iterations may increase the computational burden excessively.
Hence, some practical approaches are needed to be used in order to compute the interval mode shapes. In this paper, it is assumed that the mode shapes behave nearly monotonic in the region of variation if the uncertainty in the updating parameters can be considered as small relative to whole domain of definition.
Nevertheless, it should be noted that the minimum and the maximum of all the mode shape components exist at different vertex points at each a -cut level. In Fig. 2 , a -cut levels and the vertex points are shown for two parameters.

In order to reduce the computational time required for the calculation of the bounds of each of the mode shape components, a second order Taylor expansion is proposed. f bounds for the i th component of the j th mode shape vector. The deterministic updating parameter vector h 0 can be obtained via deterministic model updating. The vectors D h l and D h u the updated parameter changes that make the corresponding mode shape component minimum and maximum in the specified interval, respectively. These are the optimization variables of the updating problem. In this point, the following question should be asked: Which sign should be assigned to the vectors D h l so as to make the mode shape components minimum and maximum? In order to find the signs of the components of these vectors, an initial interval which is relatively larger than the prospective uncertainty can be assigned to the updating para-meters around their deterministic values. Then the vertex points which make each mode shape component extremum can be determined either by the transformation method or any global optimization algorithm.
 degrees of influence r i which is a product of the transformation method. In Section 7 , the relation between the coefficient of variation and the degrees of influence will be addressed. The degree of influence r i , quantifies the relative contribution of each input uncertainty to the uncertainty of the outputs. These para-meters are given in Eqs. (24) X (28) .

The number of parameters and the number of a -cuts are denoted by n and m, respectively. Finally, z j element of the transformed interval array at the jth a -cut level.
Detailed information can be found in ( Hanss, 2005 ). 6. Optimization algorithm presented which facilitate the optimization process. As known, GA is one of the most efficient heuristic optimization techniques.
The method is based on the principle of the survival of the fittest and natural evolution. The evolutionary process in GA is simu-lated using its basic operators; selection, crossover and mutation.
In the last decade, GA is frequently applied to FEMU problem ( Meruane and Heylen, 2011 ; Na et al., 2011 ; Buezas et al., 2011 ; Perera and Torres, 2006 ; Rao et al., 2004 ).
 simulates the social behavior of bird flocking and fish schooling. ( Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995 ). PSO is initialized with a population of particles similar to GA. Subsequently, the solution space is searched using the fitness values of each particle. As a distinctive feature, the PSO has a memory in which the best values of each particle are preserved during each iteration. PSO creates new particles for the next generation according to the Eqs. (29) and (30) . v  X  wv k i  X  c 1 r 1 pbest i x k i  X  c 2 r 2 gbest k x k i  X  29  X  x where in Eqs. (29) and (30) , k is the iteration number, v k current velocity of particles, x k i is the current position of the particles, w is an inertia coefficient balancing the global and local search, r 1 and r 2 are random numbers in the range [0,1] and c and c 2 y are the weighting coefficients. In this study, w is randomly selected between [0,1] per each iteration, c 1 and c are set equal to 2 which is the most commonly used value for these parameters.

In this paper, PSO is directly used as the crossover operator of the real coded GA. In this manner, the important features of the two algorithms are combined. Thus, a robust heuristic algorithm is constructed and applied in the FFEMU procedure. A numerical comparison between standard GA operators and the proposed hybrid method is given in the next section. GA with PSO is compared with BLX-a , simulated binary crossover (SBX), parent centric normal distribution crossover (PNX), heuristic crossover (HX) and Laplace crossover (LX). The detailed information about these common operators can be found in Herrera et al. (2003) .
A master slave parallel GA is coded and implemented on a parallel cluster with distributed memory architecture in order to tackle with the computational burden. For more detailed discussion for the parallel GA see Lim et al. (2007) . 7. Numerical verification
In this section, the presented FFEMU algorithm is compared with MCS method for a reinforced frame structure. The geometric representation of the frame structure is given in Fig. 3 .Itis assumed that the frame structure is designed appropriately according to the weak beam-strong column philosophy. Hence, the plastic hinges will form in beams close to the face of the columns. The elements in the vicinity of the beam-column connections are selected as the damaged elements. Thus, a total of 12 elements are selected as damaged elements. A damage scenario is applied on the structure in which the stiffness values of beam elements are decreased by stiffness reduction factors. The stiffness reduction factors are given in Table 1 . The material parameters used in the model are as follows: Young X  X  modulus E  X  30 GPa, mass density r  X  2500 kg/m 3 , dimensions of beams and the columns are 0.60 0.25. Typical story height and beam spans are taken as 3 m and 4 m, respectively.

Before the application of FFEMU, GA with PSO algorithm is compared with some traditional crossover operators commonly used in GA literature to verify the efficiency of the proposed optimization algorithm. The comparison is carried out for the deterministic FEMU. The convergence curves for each crossover operator within 500 generations for 20 independent runs are given in Fig. 4 . The proposed algorithm is indicated as CrPSO. As shown in Fig. 4 , all operators convergence to a certain value (e.g., a local minimum) for all runs. However, only CrPSO jump over this certain value in some of the independent runs. This clearly indicates the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed optimization algorithm. The superiority of algorithm can be compared by many other optimization algorithms for different criteria, however this kind of study is out of scope of this paper.
The CrPSO is also compared with the PNX crossover which gives the best results amongst the traditional crossover operators for FFEMU problem. Both operators run 20 times for the FFEMU problem given by Eq. (5) at zero a -level. For each operator, mean of the best objective function values, standard deviation, success rate (percentage of successful runs) and average number of function evaluations of successful runs are given in Table 2 in order to compare the CrPSO and the PNX in terms of the reliability, the accuracy and the efficiency. The successful runs are the runs in which the objective function value is less than 5 This value is chosen as a threshold since the results do not differ significantly after this value. As apparent in Table 2 , the CrPSO is better than the PNX in terms of all comparison criteria. The success rate is 100% for CrPSO while it is 20% for PNX. This shows that the CrPSO is able to find the optimal or near optimal objective function values for all runs. The average number of function evaluations of successful runs which is an indicator of the efficiency of the operators is also lower for CrPSO. This means that the CrPSO requires lower number of function evaluations in order to reach the optimal solution. The same conclusions can be deducted from the convergence curves given in Fig. 5 . It should also be noted that it is possible to reach the global minimum by means of each algorithm, however, the CrPSO is more efficient, reliable and accurate than the PNX.
 The statistics of the updating parameters are first obtained with MSC method. In MCS method, 500 set noisy modal parameters are generated according to Gaussian di stribution with 1% coefficient of variation. Then, these data are used in deterministic model updating of variation and the degree of influe nce for each parameter are given for each updating parameters. As seen in Fig. 6 the degrees of influence and the coefficients of variation are inversely correlated. The degree of influence of the updati ng parameters is relatively high when the COV of these parameters are small and vice versa. This means that the model parameters with small COV would have high degree of influence and the effect of variation in these parameters would be high on the output responses.

The probability density function of each updating parameter obtained with MCS method is given in Fig. 7 . As it is apparent in
Fig. 7 , sample sequences for some elements are rather scattered indicating large COV and some are not. The updating parameters with small COV and high degree of influence are estimated more accurately. The updating parameters 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11 and 12 have the highest COV. Hence, their values distributed into a wide area in the parameter space. However, for the parameters 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8, opposite is true. These parameters are estimated more accurate which means that response parameters are more sensitive to this model parameters at the current damage state. Actually, due to the symmetry of the structure it would be expected that statistics of the updating parameters 1 X 4, 2 X 3, 5 X 8 etc. should be same.
However, they are different due to severity of the damage in each element. So, the magnitude of the damage can be estimated more accurately for the elements which have higher damage level. by the FFEMU procedure is presented in Fig. 8 .Asapparentin Fig. 8 , the element 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 have smallest uncertainty while the elements 10, 11 and 12 have the highest uncertainty. This means that Best Fitness Best Fitness Best Fitness the results obtained by the FFEMU are correspond well with the results of the MCS method even tho ugh the results obtained from both method contains some errors. There are sampling errors in MCS while FFEMU approximate the interval bounds of the output para-meters by Taylor series. However, t hese approximations have slight effect on the final distributions and membership function of the updating parameter, especially when the uncertainty is small. Similar comments can be made on FFEMU results. For the parameters in which their degree of influence is low, amount of uncertainty is parameters on the output parameter s is low. Especially, the reduction factors for the elements 10, 11, 12 have the highest uncertainty which makes them less sensitive parameters to the output parameters. This is due to fact that these elements have the less effect on the global behavior of the structure. In order to detect the magnitude of the damage more accurately, measurement data which are more sensi-tive to these updating parameters should be involved in the objective function. Otherwise, if the measurement and modeling noise is increased, it might not be possible to estimate the magnitude of the damage for these elements. However, we would still decide from a possibilistic point of view whether these elements are damaged or not.

Nonlinear relationship between the input and the output para-meters can also be detected by FFEMU. Although the uncertain modal parameters are represented by normal Gaussian fuzzy numbers, some updated parameters have slight skewness as shown in Fig. 8 . This is largely due to the nonlinear relationship between the input and output parameters. The amount of uncertainty considered in the modal parame ters can be higher in real-life application depending on the environmental conditions in which the structure is exposed to. Even in this situation, proposed FFEMU is still applicable. However, d epending on the selected model parameters, errors in calculating the interval bounds of the response parameters might increase due to errors in Taylor expansion. In those cases, the error should be checked by preliminary analysis using the initial model. It should also be noted that the use of simplified models in which the relationship between inputs and outputs are not so complicated does not make the uncertainty analysis meaningless. Rather, use of those models are generally make better predictions by means of less data and crude models. 8. Conclusion
A fuzzy finite element model updating technique is presented to investigate the effect of the measurement noise in the updating parameters. Measurement noise in the modal parameters is modeled by fuzzy numbers and an inverse finite element analysis is carried out in order to determine the fuzzy membership functions of the updating parameters. An optimization method is employed to solve the inverse problem. An objective function is constructed including the differences between the experimental and the numerical interval modal parameters. This objective 0.05 0.15 0.25 0.35 Coefficient of variation function is minimized by an improved heuristic optimization algorithm which consists of a hybrid version of the genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. As the objective function that has to be minimized could be very complicated and contain many local minima depending on the input X  X utput relation, such improved methods have to be employed to find the correct updating parameters. Additionally, practical evaluation of the interval bounds of the modal parameters during the optimi-zation process using the second order Taylor expansion is presented. Forward fuzzy or interval analysis is already required too many calculations and arithmetic operations in order to find the exact bounds of the output parameters. When it is employed with global optimization methods, computation burden increases dramatically. Hence, Taylor series provide a way to simplify all these calculations by not compromising on the accuracy too much when the uncertainty level is low.

Probability density Function Element11 the modal parameters are identifi ed less accurately. The level of sensitivity for the updating parameters can be determined by the coefficient of variation and the degree of influence. The parameters which have low degree of influence also have large coefficient of variation. These parameters contain more uncertainty due to lack of information which is sensitive to these parameters in the measure-ment data. Similar results can be drawn by other probabilistic methods and sensitivity analysi s. However, the proposed FFEMU method is very practical and accurate although the interaction between output variables is not taken into account. This method does not require any derivative information during optimization process. Derivative information should be once calculated around the deterministic model parameters in order to approximate the modal parameters. As mentioned before, this approximation will be quite accurate if the input X  X utput relation is monotonic as it is in our case.

The results also show that the present FFEMU procedure has also significant advantages over MCS method in terms of the computational efficiency. It can also be said that quantification and propagation of uncertainty through model parameters can be carried out by FFEMU in a practical way.
