 Abstract The main purpose of this paper is to serve as a landmark for future research and in particular for future strategic, infrastructural and coordination initiatives. It presents a preliminary plan for actions and infrastructures that could become the basis for future initiatives in the sector of Language Resources and Technologies (LRTs). The FLaReNet Language Resource Strategic Agenda presents a set of recommen-dations for the development and progress of LRT in Europe, as issued from a three-year consultation of the FLaReNet European project. Recommendations cover a broad range of topics and activities, spanning over production and use of language resources, licensing, maintenance and preservation issues, infrastructures for language resour-ces, resource identification and sharing, evaluation and validation, interoperability and policy issues. The intended recipients belong to a large set of players and stakeholders in LRT, ranging from individuals to research and education institutions, to policy-makers, funding agencies, SMEs and large companies, service and media providers. The main goal of these recommendations is to serve as an instrument to support stakeholders in planning for and addressing the urgencies of the LRT of the future. Keywords Strategic agenda Language resources planning Recommended priority actions 1 Introduction The EU has established that despite the complexities associated with handling multilingualism, cultural and linguistic differences are a unique asset and are to be preserved. Considerable investment has therefore been put into finding means, and not only those which are purely technological, of overcoming language barriers and of supporting European citizens and industry in a world that is becoming ever more influenced by globalisation. Language Resources (LRs) are critical in the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications for a multilingual society. They are also an essential component in bridging language barriers and aiding in the creation of a new environment in which information can flow more smoothly across cultural and linguistic frontiers. They represent the backbone of Language Technologies (LTs) and a great majority of industrial technological applications that handle natural language in such areas as Machine Translation, Cross-lingual Information Retrieval, etc., incorporate LRs as critical ingredients. Even if many LTs incorporate language-independent engines, they are still heavily reliant upon the availability of language-dependent knowledge in the form of LRs when it comes to their real world implementation. At the same time it has been shown time and again that a critical mass of LRs can be a major catalyst in the advancement of research and of technology development.

Nowadays with the accelerating pace of developments in LT the LR community is becoming increasingly more active. On the other hand, and in spite of the considerable technological progresses of the last decade, the challenge of overcoming the current state of fragmentation and imbalance inside the LR and LT communities is still a significant one for all languages. EU officials are particularly concerned by the fact that the most comprehensive language technology solutions in support of multilingualism are being delivered, in many cases, by large US corporations like Google and Microsoft. These companies are able to play a dominant role in the field because of their access to huge amounts of data in several different languages, alongside their considerable financial resources, massive computing power and the ability to capitalise on a direct research-to-application pipeline that utilises a new business model based on so-called  X  X  X ree X  X  services. In Europe on the other hand, the landscape is far more splintered, with some languages being relatively well served and others being offered very little support. The European LR Community stands in need of the kind of coherent approach that can only be assured through a shared commitment to a set of common aims and priorities.

This paper describes the major high-level recommendations that were collected during the three years of activity of the FLaReNet Thematic Network. FLaReNet was an EU-financed project 1 that aimed at the constitution of an international forum for the development of a much needed common vision and of a European strategy for consolidating the sector, thus enhancing competitiveness both at the EU level and worldwide. By acting as an aggregator and facilitator of information sharing and discussion, FLaReNet brought together leading experts from research institu-tions, academies, companies, consortia, associations, funding agencies, as well as a number of other public and private bodies both at the European and international levels (Fig. 1 ).

The broad participation of numerous key-figures ensured that the recommenda-tions were formulated through a consensual, bottom-up, process in which the relevant scientific, technical, organisational and strategic aspects were taken into account. The recommendations presented in this paper are the result of a permanent and cyclical consultation that FLaReNet has conducted inside the community it represents X  X ith more than 300 members X  X nd outside it, through interactions with neighbouring projects, associations, initiatives, funding agencies and government institutions.

Thanks to initiatives such as the FLaReNet project, the problem of the fragmentation of the sector is now finally starting to be tackled and a new awareness is spreading as to the necessity of joining forces and of building a stable community. If a coordinated and concerted approach is adopted X  X hat is if all interested stakeholders agree to follow a common plan of action X  X hen chances are that we can really improve the current situation for all languages. 1.1 A review of past efforts in building large LR programs In the US the systematic accumulation of large amounts of language data has been a priority since the early 90s when the rapid growth of statistical approaches to NLP helped to propagate the idea that  X  X  X here X  X  no data like more data X  X . Since then, this approach has been extended to other areas of language technology: e.g. Information Retrieval by search engines, Machine Translation, and other areas such as Computer Vision. Statistical methods paved the way for DARPA-style comparative evaluation campaigns led by the National Bureau of Standards (now known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST 2 ) starting from 1987. The growing need to gather large quantities of data in order to train statistically based systems resulted in the creation of the Linguistic Data Consortium 3 in 1992.

In Europe similar efforts to those in the US were made, in particular, with the launching of the European Language Resource Association (ELRA 4 ) in 1995. In 1998 ELRA founded the ongoing LREC series of conferences 5 in order to promote LRs and their evaluation. The importance of LRs for driving LT was also recognized by the European Commission which began a number of initiatives in the  X 90s for the development of spoken and written resources as well as for establishing standards for their representation. However, Europe missed the opportunity of creating a permanent evaluation agency comparable to NIST in the US, although a number of stakeholders including ELRA/ELDA 6 have since taken on a similar role.

As a result of the pioneering US efforts and the considerable DARPA funding of this research, (American) English has by far the best language data coverage of any language, so that many in the scientific community work mostly on English language data and report results about English language phenomena. This has meant that LTs and their applications have been steadily becoming more and more advanced for English, which in turn produces yet more data and induces the organization of yet more evaluation campaigns, including those involving the study of the metrics themselves.

The data varies considerably in the case of other languages. Some languages are relatively well covered thanks to funding programs that provide the investment needed to produce data and test systems. In the US, this is true for geopolitically significant languages (e.g. those spoken in Iraq, Afghanistan or in the Balkans). Moreover, European countries such as France, Germany and The Netherlands have given substantial funding to national programs that have helped to accelerate such kinds of research. However most of the world X  X  languages do not enjoy such levels of state support.

In some countries, language has become a major political issue, either because of a strong desire to promote certain languages (e.g. Baltic countries) or because of a constitutional obligation to preserve the languages spoken by the citizens of those countries (e.g. India and South Africa). In such cases, a country will prioritize the development of LT to order to preserve languages and ensure communication in them, even if the country itself only has limited financial resources to be able to do this. This sort of political commitment to LT in support of multilingualism is not yet typical of the European Commission, nor among the twenty seven Member States of the European Union. 1.2 The FLaReNet Strategic Agenda As we have mentioned above, LRs play a key role in the development of NLP applications for a multilingual Europe. However, realising this kind of vision requires a coordinated effort on the part of all concerned stakeholders. The FLaReNet Strategic Agenda highlights the most pressing needs for the sector and presents a set of recommendations for the development and progress of LRs in Europe. These recommendations were the result of a 3-year consultation which gathered together worldwide representatives from industry (software companies, technology providers, users), government agencies, research organisations, univer-sities, non-governmental organisations and language communities.

The FLaReNet Strategic Agenda covers a broad range of topics and activities, spanning the production and use of LRs; licensing, maintenance and preservation issues; infrastructures for LRs; resource identification and sharing; evaluation and validation; interoperability and policy issues.
 In principle this Strategic Agenda is addressed to a diverse set of stakeholders in LTs: ranging from private individuals to research and education institutions, policy-makers, funding agencies, both SMEs and large companies as well as service and media providers. Its main goal is thus to serve as an instrument to support these stakeholders in planning for and addressing the urgencies of the LTs of the future. The recommendations contained in the present document should therefore prove useful to any person or organisation X  X hether at a European, international, national, local, or private level X  X ishing to draft a program of activities for a particular community. 7
The recommendations are organised according to nine different dimensions which loosely reflect the broad thematic clusters that emerged during the FLaReNet consultations: (a) Documentation ; (b) Interoperability ; (c) Availability, Sharing and Distribution ; (d) Coverage, Quality and Adequacy ; (e) Sustainability ; (f) Recog-nition ; (g) Development ; (h) Infrastructure ; (i) International cooperation .
These directions focus on those areas where action needs to be targeted in order to make the field grow. Taken together these recommendations, if implemented, should begin to have a real impact on the development and success of LRs by contributing to the creation of a sustainable Language Resources and Technology (LRT) ecosystem where infrastructural issues interact with research and development issues, and political and strategic aspects are also taken full account of. 2 Resource documentation The need for accurate and reliable documentation of LRs is indisputable. It is still too often the case that LRs are either poorly documented or not documented at all: and even when documentation is available it is often not very easy to find. This is a pressing issue as there can be little doubt that documentation is crucial in facilitating the discovery and use of LRs. To this end the following recommendations have been made. 2.1 Develop and adopt a widely agreed standard documentation template for Documentation is essential for the use of LRs by users other than those responsible for developing the resource in the first place. The variable nature of documentation can hamper the dissemination and replication of LRs and also makes it hard for users to compare how-to files. This underlines the necessity for the establishment of common best practices and guidelines for writing documentation, and in particular for the development of standard specifications for LR documentation. Documen-tation should be as exhaustive as possible, and should include information about data formats and data content, the production context, and existing possible applications.

Human users typically need information that will help them  X  locate a resource and assess its usefulness for a given application,  X  understand the production process, the use of best practices, and the intended  X  assess the quality of a resource, replicate processes and results, and handle
On the other hand, machines need (machine-understandable) information in order to  X  discover and compare resources,  X  validate formats and annotations and process annotations appropriately,  X  retrieve relevant parts of a resource for a given use, and enable other as yet
Uniform documentation is vital. Ideally a common documentation template, after having been defined, should then be promoted and enforced for all contracts for publicly funded projects. Good documentation should include at least the following information: (a) a high-level description giving the interested but non-expert reader a good idea (b) information about the theoretical framework, background and/or the  X  X  X hilos-(c) specification of the methodology used to create the resource so that others can (d) annotation specifications (with data categories and their semantics) and (e) information about the use of standards at all levels of the development process, (f) specification of the methodology or guidelines used to assess the quality of the (g) estimates of the effort required to create the resource (in any reproducible unit, 2.2 When producing an LR, time and manpower should be allocated to In every LR production project, part of the project funding should always be allocated to documentation and dissemination activities. Policy Makers, both at the National and European level, should support activities for collecting and storing documentation for LRs in appropriate infrastructures. An effort must be made to collect all existing LR documentation and to make it easily available. To this end the design and construction of a (virtual) repository of specifications, guidelines, and documentation of LRs, starting with reference resource models or well-known and widely used resources (e.g. WordNet and the Penn TreeBank) is a priority task. 2.3 Ensure that appropriate metadata are consistently adopted for describing Ensuring that LRs are easily discoverable is the first step towards promoting a better data economy within the LRT community. Language Resource Providers should always document their resources using standard metadata and unique resource identifiers; therefore the adoption of a system of standardized metadata must be the respect would be to document resources in an open catalogue such as the ELRA Universal Catalogue, the META-SHARE or CLARIN catalogues. By providing standard APIs to query the catalogues, it would then be possible to harvest individual catalogues and compile unified catalogues via metadata aggregation. Policy makers for their part must support metadata creation by means of promotional activities. At the European level for instance there should be an established set of guidelines and rules for the description of available LRs using metadata.
 2.4 Set up a global infrastructure of common and uniform and/or interoperable One of the main reasons why it is currently so difficult to find resources that match specific needs and languages is the lack of compatibility between different sets of metadata. Different sub-communities, data distribution centers, archiving institu-tions and projects, and other providers will often use distinct, non-interoperable, metadata sets to describe their data X  X ften at different levels of granularity. It is essential therefore to work towards the full interoperability of metadata sets. It is also important to move towards the creation of machine-understandable metadata that can be processed automatically and which has a formally defined syntax and semantics. This will make metadata accessible from a greater range of software tools and allow it to be used for a greater variety of purposes. Ideally, formalized metadata elements should be used as much as possible by LR Providers and should incorporate all those aspects of the documentation of a LR that can be formalized. At the same time data categories used in metadata and in data should be registered in a data category registry in order to ensure semantic interoperability. The development of techniques for automating the process of metadata creation would also help spread the adoption of machine-understandable metadata. 2.5 Develop and support community-wide initiatives Some useful current initiatives in this direction include documentation based initiatives such as the LRE Map 8 thanks to which the widespread documentation of existing resources has been achieved within a limited time frame and with an economy of effort. The LRE Map initiative has the additional advantage that all resources are documented in a uniform and standard-compliant way. 3 Resource interoperability The interoperability of resources refers to the extent to which LRs are compatible in the sense of allowing, for instance, the merging of data that derives from different LRs, while preserving the semantics of each resource. Today the absence of interoperability between LRs and their lack of compliance with standards has a substantial monetary cost. For instance it is estimated that buyers and providers of translation services can lose anything from 10 to 40 % of their budgets or revenues due to the fact that LRs are not stored in compatible standard formats (van der Meer 2011 ). The following recommendations are intended to remedy this state of affairs. 3.1 Ensure syntactic and semantic interoperability of language resources Syntactic interoperability is the capacity of different systems to process exchanged data either directly or via trivial conversion; semantic interoperability on the other hand is the capacity of systems to interpret exchanged linguistic information in meaningful and consistent ways via reference to a common set of reference categories (Ide and Pustejovsky 2010 ). Interoperability of resources and data is also an essential prerequisite for the successful exploitation of the massive amounts of data that internet has made available during the past two decades. Efficient access to data along with sufficiently interlinked data is as important as the actual quantity of data itself, and data interoperability is an essential prerequisite here. A collective exercise to evaluate (and possibly measure) interoperability could be set up as an  X  X  X nteroperability challenge X  X , 9 under the form of an international initiative to evaluate and possibly measure interoperability. The design of interoperability tasks is the result of the collaboration between FLaReNet and US project SILT (Ide et al. 2009 ), and is envisaged as an overall challenge that explicitly requires the use and integration of multiple data formats, annotation schemes, and processing modules, so that players will be highly motivated to adapt, adopt, use standards and common formats and could start seeing the big advantages they offer. Such an initiative will also help to determine which emerging standards are the useful in promoting interoperability. As a side effect interoperability tests can also foreseeably replace certain aspects of validation. 3.2 Create a permanent standards observatory or standards watch While it is becoming widely recognised that standards are key to resource sharing, re-usability, maintainability and long-term preservation, LR providers on the whole still tend to lack a clear understanding of why standards are of assistance in representing data X  X s well as of some of the other important advantages that come from adopting standards. As a result many types of resources and many kinds of annotations are not standardised. Most existing resources are based on unique representation formats and conventions meaning that other users must first understand the format of a given resource and then instantiate ad hoc conversions prior to using the resource data for their own activities. This makes it especially difficult to draw on different sources in order to build on-demand resources such as are required by emerging web technologies.

The lack of standardisation also makes it difficult to evaluate the quality and value of resources for a given application. A basic level of standardisation is particularly vital for so-called  X  X  X ess-resourced X  X  Languages. One solution would be to work towards the establishment of a broad-based framework for the interoper-ability of LRs and LTs, a process that should include the participation of industry thus ensuring that there is broad-based adoption of standards. There should also be a greater awareness of the importance of standards for resource producers/managers who are attracted by the prospect of joining the open-access community in order to boost the utilisation of their resources, thereby increasing visibility and attracting more users and funding. An initial step towards these goals has been made by FLaReNet with the production of a document (Calzolari et al. 2011a ) that presents an overview of the current scene with the view to creating an Interoperability Framework. This document should act as a reference point for the standards that are currently being promoted for adoption by the community. 3.3 Invest in standardisation activities Investment in standardisation activities at the supra-national level is of the utmost importance. In particular, support must be given to infrastructural activities for collecting and disseminating information on existing standards and best practices. At the same time, activities for setting up new standards where they do not exist should also be funded. 3.4 Encourage/enforce use of best practices or standards in LR production It is important that community and funding agencies join forces so as to push forward the use of existing and emerging standards, at least in those areas where there is some degree of consensus (e.g. external descriptive metadata, meta-models, part-of-speech and morpho-syntactic information, etc.). The only way to ensure useful feedback so that current and emerging standards can be improved and advanced is to use these standards on a regular basis. The enforcement and promotion of standards at all stages of LR production, from basic standardisation for less-resourced languages (such as orthography normalization, transcription of oral data, etc.) to more complex areas (such as syntax, semantics, etc.) is of crucial importance. LR providers, for their part, should look out for those standards and best practices that best fit the LRs to be produced, right from early design/specification stages and then use these standards and practices to guide the production of LRs that are easily amenable to reuse (e.g. adopt formats that allow easy reuse). The creation of  X  X  X fficial X  X  validator roles to check the compliance of LRs with basic linguistic standards is an activity that must be pursued and encouraged by funding agencies. Educational activities, such as training initiatives to promote and disseminate standards amongst students and young researchers, are an important and effective means of enforcing a  X  X  X tandards culture X  X . 3.5 Make standards operational and put them in use As most users are not very concerned about whether or not they are using standards, there should be easy-to-use tools that help them to apply standards while hiding most of the technical details. The goal would be to have standards operating in the background as  X  X  X ntrinsic X  X  properties of a piece of LT or as one of the more generic tools that people/end-users use. LR providers should encourage the building of tools that enable the use of standards and work towards increasing the availability of sharable/exchangeable data. Funding agencies, on the other hand, should fund the development and/or maintenance of tools that support/enforce/validate standards. 3.6 Identify newly mature areas for standardisation and promote joint efforts There should be a regular examination of new fields to check whether they are  X  X  X ature X  X  enough to start a standardisation initiative (for instance semantic roles and spatial language). A joint effort between academia and industry will be advanta-geous towards this end and thus should also be promoted. 4 Resource availability: sharing and distribution By availability here we refer to the extent to which a given resource is actually made available for use by third parties. This implies decisions about licensing and business models. 4.1 Opt for the openness of LRs, especially publicly funded ones There is strong impulse nowadays towards open data in the sense of data that is easily obtainable and can be used with few if any restrictions. More precisely, according to the Open Knowledge Foundation data is open if  X  X  X ou are free to use, reuse, and distribute it X  X ubject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and share-alike X  X .  X  X  X roducers of data will benefit from opening it to broad access and will prefer to deposit their data with confidence in reliable repositories (Giaretta 2011 ) X  X . The LR community has started to embrace the view presented in the Giaretta quote seeing open data as digital resources that are distributed under open source-type licenses which allow them to be used, modified (and redistributed).

While the majority of LR experts advocate that data be openly available and reusable, only 55 % of the resources documented by the LRE Map are freely available. Reluctance towards fully embracing an open data model still seems to be common. It appears however that the availability of massive quantities of open data could transform the NLP industry, for example in the case of translation technologies (van der Meer 2011 ).

A study by KPMG on the Canadian Spatial Data Infrastructure (Sears 2001 ) concluded that closed, restricted data can cause major economic harm:  X  X  X he consequences [of cost recovery] for businesses are higher marginal costs, lower research and development investments and threatened marginal products. The results for consumers are negative: higher prices and reduced products and services. The overall economic consequences ... are fewer jobs, reduced economic output by almost $2.6 billion and a lower gross domestic product. X  X 
At least one branch of Language Technology, Question Answering, has benefited greatly from the availability of open data resources, especially the research datasets created for the yearly TREC question answering track. Sharing resources, both data and tools, has become a viable means of encouraging open data, and the community is strongly investing in facilities for the discovery and use of resources by its federated members. These facilities, such as the META-SHARE infrastructure, 10 represent an optimal intermediate solution responding to the need for data variety, ease of retrieval, better data description and community-wide access, while at the same time helping to bypass some of the intricate issues associated with IPR. 11 4.2 Ensure that publicly funded resources are publicly available either free of The results of a questionnaire carried out by FLaReNet strongly supported the idea that at least those resources developed with public funding should be made openly available. For mixed-funded initiatives (private/public), it should be ensured from the beginning that there is an agreement to make resources available at fair market conditions.

Another suggestion is to secure the openness of resources for most types of uses, making use of standardised licenses where available, and creating LRs in collaborative projects where resources are exchanged among project participants after production. Of course, certain types of data are and will probably remain non-shareable, either because they contain personal data, or for confidentiality or reasons of competition. Non-shared data can still be exploited however, for instance through shared services. In the meantime, it is important to define appropriate criteria for different levels of openness and to define  X  X  X est practices X  X  for making resources available that address different constraints that may be faced. 4.3 Clear intellectual property rights at the early stages of production; try to Authors do not yet have a sufficient grasp of the relevant EU trans-border legal issues supporting enhanced resource sharing and legally protecting LRs against improper reuse, copying, modification etc. The Berne Convention for the Protection of Library and Artistic Works extends copyright protection to creators in countries other than their own, but enforcement is still a national issue and is therefore implemented in different ways. In addition to this, the availability and use of huge quantities of web data as useful resources creates a novel situation that raises further legal problems.

On the one hand IPRs (especially authorship) need to be protected; but on the other they tend to restrict accessibility to and usability of LRs. The current trend is towards a culture of free/open use with less protective holders X  rights. Creative Commons, for example, is one of the most widely used license models for LR (see Google, Wikipedia, Whitehouse.gov, Public Library of Science, and Flickr). From a practical point of view, producers of LRs should try to clear IPR at the early stages of production, ensuring that re-use is permitted. 4.4 Educate key players in basic legal know how It is crucial to disseminate a certain amount of legal knowledge/know-how in order to educate all (major) players in the LRT area. It is also important to acquaint a number of lawyers of community concerns so they can develop adequate frameworks to address such issues. Moreover, it is important that such legal experts are asked to intervene in the initial phases of resource production, in order to ensure that all legal (and also ethical, privacy and other) aspects are taken into consideration when planning for long-term LR sharing and distribution. 4.5 Elaborate specific, simple and harmonized licensing solutions for data The community should avoid one-size-fits-all solutions. There are a large number of licensing schemes already in use today, some are backed by strong players (ELRA, LDC, open source communities such as Creative Commons, 12 GNU General Public License, etc.), others have been drafted bilaterally and in some cases by the legal departments of data providers. It is crucial that such licensing is harmonized and even standardized. Licensing schemes need to be simplified through broad-based solutions for both R&amp;D and industry. Electronic licensing (e-licenses) should be adopted and current distribution models to new media (web, mobile devices, etc.) should be accepted. 5 Resource coverage, quality, adequacy With the current data-driven paradigm in force, innovation in LT crucially depends on LRs.

Emphasis is increasingly being placed upon the high quality and large size of resources, and as production (still) takes a lot of effort and is very costly, development of resources for future technologies and applications must start now in order to positively impact the development of multilingual technologies. As stated by (Mladenic and Grobelnik 2011 ),  X  X  X he development of killer applications crucially depends on the availability of large quantities of data. Cross-lingual knowledge extraction, for instance, is a challenging high impact task for the near and mid future. Today, the tasks seems to be achievable because critical mass of technology is collected X  X .

Despite the vast amount of academic and industrial investment, there are not enough resources available to satisfy the needs of all languages, quantitatively and qualitatively. LRs should be produced and made available for every language, every register, every domain to guarantee full coverage, high quality and adequacy for the various LT applications. We need the right amount, the right type and the right quality of resources. 5.1 Increase quantity of resources available to address language and application Dependence on data creates new disparities for under-resourced languages and domains. It is estimated that 95 % of web pages are written in the top 20 most spoken languages (Pimienta et al. 2009 ): naturally, smaller language communities produce much less data than speakers of more dominant languages. The same problems occur for language data in narrow domains with their own specific terminological and stylistic requirements. To ensure Universal Linguistic Rights and the massive deployment of LT applications, language services should be provided for everyone in his or her own mother tongue. Funding must be found to cover all languages (including the world X  X  less-well represented languages) in future multilingual applications in order to develop LRs for all languages. The provision of high quality resources for all European languages, including minority ones, must be a priority now in order to avoid disparity in the future. 5.2 Implement BLARKs for all languages, especially less-resourced ones For the particular advancement of LTs, Basic Language Resource Kits 13 (or BLARKs) should be supported and developed for all languages, and at least for the main areas of LT application (Machine Translation, Information Retrieval, Question Answering to mention a few). Many undocumented languages are at high risk of becoming extinct in the digital age, and therefore such minority and fringe languages should be comprehensively represented through spoken and written corpora and manuscripts in these languages should be digitized.

In order to move in this direction, the BLaRK concept firstly needs to be worked out in detail so that it can be embodied as a standard, and planned revision sessions should be arranged; this is because it is an intrinsically dynamic notion that changes over time with the change in technology development in different countries. Secondly, regular BLaRK surveys must be conducted in order to produce a clear picture of technology trends, and establish (and regularly update) a roadmap covering all aspects of LTs. Thirdly, resource production should be funded on the basis of BLaRK-like criteria, i.e., giving priority to the development of  X  X  X issing X  X  resource types for each language. 5.3 Provide high quality resources for all European languages High quality resources should be regarded as a key driver for effective technology in broad areas (e-content, media, health, automotive, telecoms, etc.). To this end and to reduce the amount of human intervention and revision, automatic techniques should be promoted to guarantee quality through error detection and confidence assess-ment. The promotion of validation and evaluation can play a valuable role in fostering the improvement of formal and content quality of resources. 5.4 Devise new methods for LR quality check New tools should be developed and the maximal use of existing tools should be ensured with respect to the automatic or semi-automatic formal and content validation of LRs. LR quality requirements should be assessed by a think-tank composed of recognized experts representing a broad spectrum from within the LR community. The community along with policy makers should ensure that a quick quality check can be carried out, at least for existing resources. Projects/players should be encouraged to specify a validation procedure before LR production starts. A  X  X  X uality Seal of Approval X  X , along the lines of the  X  X  X ata Seal of Approval X  X  should be defined and endorsed by the community. 5.5 Establish a European evaluation and validation body Evaluation in Europe is currently carried out by individual institutions (such as ELDA and CELCT 14 ) and by short-term projects (e.g. the TC-STAR 15 and CHIL campaigns 16 ), but there is no sustained European-wide coordination, as there is in the US (NIST) or Japan (NII 17 ). In specific areas, the community has organised itself to carry out regular evaluations (e.g. CLEF 2000 X 2010, 18 and Semeval 19 )but with limited funding and a lot of community good will. It is of the utmost importance to establish common and standard LT evaluation procedures in Europe. The establishment of such procedures would boost research around evaluation measures, as has already happened in the US. 5.6 Create an infrastructure for coordinated LRT evaluation The creation of a European infrastructure enabling a coordinated evaluation of LRTs is a priority. Setting up an evaluation management and coordination structure would ensure a viable, consistent and coherent programme of activities that can successfully scale up and embrace new communities and technological paradigms. This should be coupled with the establishment of a sustainable technical infrastructure providing data, tools and services to carry out systematic evaluation. This could be a distributed infrastructure involving existing organizations. 5.7 Carry out evaluation in real-world scenarios Evaluation should encompass technologies, resources, guidelines and documenta-tion. But like the technologies it addresses, evaluation is constantly evolving, and new, more specific measures using innovative methodologies are needed to evaluate, for example, the reliability of semantic annotations. Current evaluation campaigns sometimes create rather artificial settings in order to stay  X  X cademically clean X , making the tasks they measure somewhat unrealistic. One of the most critical challenges, therefore, is to introduce new types of campaigns, possibly based on task-based evaluation. 5.8 Promote evaluation and validation activities of LRs and the dissemination of In order to foster evaluation activities it is important that they be regarded as a major research topic (encompassing research on metrics, methodologies, etc.) and especially as the potential subject for a PhD. Thorough dissemination of activities and achievements should be carried out through LRT evaluation portals (e.g. the ELRA HLT evaluation portal 20 ). 5.9 Assess the maturity of technologies for which resources can be developed It is important to assess the availability of existing resources with respect to their adequacy for current applications and technology requirements. This involves assessing the maturity of the technologies for which new resources should be developed. We recommend, to this end, closely monitoring research developments through publications and patent filing, and drawing up a list of the top 20 technologies in order to ensure that crucial resources are developed in at least ten of these, in a publicly and fully funded framework. Regular evaluation campaigns to assess the progress made by such technologies with respect to the state-of-the art is also desirable, especially if conducted within an evaluation framework along the lines depicted above. 6 Resource sustainability Sustainability covers preservation, accessibility, and operability (among other things) all of which mutually influence one another. Currently, most (data and software) resource building and distribution is based on short-term projects, which often leads to the loss of resources when these projects are over. LRs must be accessible over the long term. This means (a) archiving and preserving the data by the production unit, and also archiving them off-site (e.g. in very-long term archiving/data centres); (b) maintaining LRs in an appropriate way; and (c) making sure that linguistic tools and resources are sustainable, e.g. by requesting resource accessibility and usability for a given time frame. The FLaReNet project has developed an analytic model of sustainability in which extrinsic and intrinsic factors are taken into account. 21 Use of this or similar models should be fostered by the entire community. A sustainability analysis must thus be part of a resource X  X  specification phase, and it is important that funding agencies impose a mandatory sustainability plan for those projects that are concerned with production of LRs. 7 Resource recognition LRs (both data and software) are time-consuming, costly and increasingly require a considerable share of research budgets. The entire ecosystem around LRs needs substantial support and recognition. Small labs and individual researchers are not keen on depositing or sharing their resources because so far there has been little incentive to do so. There are almost no rewards for researchers and institutions from sharing, preserving and maintaining resources, and this now poses a number of serious problems. 7.1 Develop a standard protocol for citing LRs LRs deserve credit and should be cited in a similar way to sources in scientific publications using a standard citation framework for which LR providers will be responsible and receive credit (this would also enforce the use of minimal metadata descriptions). Use of an International Standard Language Resource Number is especially encouraged (Choukri et al. 2012 ). A  X  X  X anguage Resources Impact Factor X  X  along the lines of similar metrics used in other fields especially in Biology, should be defined in order to enforce the practice of the citation of resources on the model of scientific paper authoring and to calculate the actual research impact of resources. 7.2 Support training in production and use of LRs There should be more training in the production and use of LRs, and LRs should be used more widely in education. In fact training in the production and use of LRs should become part of the curricula especially in Computational Linguistics and NLP. 8 Resource development Development of LRs refers to the entire production cycle of a resource. The proper management of the  X  X  X ife cycle X  X  of LR creation has attracted less attention than it should and has been largely overlooked in our community. 8.1 Ensure strong public and community support for the definition and A reference model for creating LRs will help to address the current shortage of resources in terms of breadth (languages and applications) and depth (data quality and volume). Such a reference model should also include an accurate estimate of production costs. 8.2 Go green: enforce recycling, reusing and repurposing The creation of new resources from scratch should be discouraged wherever resources are already available for a given language and/or application. We should encourage re-use and re-purposing as part of a  X  X  X ecycling X  X  culture in order to ensure the reuse of development methods, existing tools, and translation/transliteration tools, etc. 8.3 Work towards the full automation of LR data production With production costs constantly increasing, there is a real need to invest in innovative production methods that involve automatic procedures to a substantial degree in order to reduce human intervention to a minimum. We must improve existing tools and introduce new automation techniques, especially for higher-level semantic, content-related and multilingual tasks. As stated by (Vasiljevs 2011 ), the coverage problem is so great that it is necessary to promote strategies that approach or ensure full automation for (high-quality) LR data production:  X  X  X nnovation needs data, but also the collection of data needs innovation X  X . We must also foster the evaluation of real-life applications so that research can gradually approach industry needs in terms of information volume and granularity. Support must be given to academic and industrial involvement in research on automatic methods for production and validation of LRs, in order to allow a more accurate assessment of automatic methods for building LRs for real-life applications. 8.4 Invest in Web 2.0/3.0 methods for collaborative creation and extension of Given the high cost of language resource production, and the fact that in many cases it is impossible to avoid the manual construction of resources (e.g. if accurate models are requested or if there is to be reliable evaluation) it is worth considering the power of social/collaborative media to build resources: especially for those languages where no LRs have yet been built by experts. Several experiments in crowd-sourcing data collection and NLP tasks have been conducted recently (Dolan 2011 ), and most of them look promising. For instance, it has been estimated that Mechanical Turk translation is 10 X 60 times less expensive than professional translation (Callison-Burch and Dredze 2010 ). Production and annotation of LRs can be carried out as collaborative projects. Existing LRs should be  X  X  X pened up X  X  for collaborative annotation and reuse of annotated results. At the same time, new tools are to be developed and existing tools are to be adapted to the needs of collaborative work. However, the use of crowd-sourcing raises ethical, sociological and practical issues for the community. It is not yet clearly understood for example whether all types of LRs can be obtained collaboratively by using na X   X  ve annotators; more research is therefore needed on both the technical (e.g. accurately comparing the quality and content of resources built collaboratively and those built by experts) and ethical aspects of crowd-sourcing, see for instance (Zaidan and Callison-Burch 2011 ) about mechanisms for increasing quality of crowd-sourced data. 8.5 Collaborative and Web 2.0 methods for data collection and annotation A particularly sensitive case is that of less-resourced languages, where language technology should be developed rapidly to help minority-language speakers to access education and the Information Society. Basic LRs for all the world X  X  languages could be created through the building of a Web 2.0 site (using the same community computing power that generates millions of blogs) starting with the 446 languages currently present on the web. Collaborative and Web 2.0 methods for data collection and annotation seem particularly very well-suited for collecting the data needed for the development of Language Technology applications.

Currently there are insufficient resources for solving the problem of creating free, large-scale resources for the world X  X  languages, even for those with a reasonable web presence. The collaborative accumulation and creation of data appears to be the best and most practicable way to achieve better and faster language coverage; indeed, in purely economic terms it could well deliver a higher return on investment than so far expected. 9 An infrastructure of language resources As a matter of fact, researchers and developers still have to spend large amounts of time consulting multiple catalogues or searching the web to find relevant LRs and very often fail to do so. For various reasons available resources are often very difficult to access. Some are available from distribution centres (notably ELRA and LDC), others from associations or project portals, or directly from the web pages of the laboratories or researchers who developed the resource. In many cases, unless the potential user already knows certain details about the resource such as the name, owner or project, he or she will find it difficult to discover new or as yet unknown resources. The identification and discovery of  X  X  X ew/unknown X  X  resources is therefore currently a key priority and calls for the spread of a new culture of sharing and/or collaborative resource creation.

The need for an infrastructure for LRs was the first recommendation made at the beginning of FLaReNet and derives historically from the recognition of the infrastructural role of LRs as essential  X  X  X uilding blocks X  X  for LTs. A small number of infrastructure initiatives (cf. CLARIN, META-SHARE) have emerged in order to solve these problems. However, without proper coordination between these initiatives, there is a risk of further fragmentation. An additional problem is that some of the current  X  X  X nfrastructure plans X  X  are projects with a limited time duration. It is therefore time to act more decisively to build synergy between all the stakeholders in this field. 9.1 Build a sustainable facility for discovering, accessing and sharing data and Broad participation is essential in building an i nfrastructure. This infrastructure will help, in primis , to make LRs available, visible and easily accessible. Second, the infrastructure will facilitate the sharing and exchange of LR s. An initiative of this kind needs sustained support by policy makers to ensure steady dev elopment; also, promotional activities on the side of LR providers are necessary to secure visibility and participation.
The basic principles of an infrastructure for LRs and technologies require the adoption of a community approach that brings together and builds upon current experiences and endeavours. It is necessary to define and agree upon the basic criteria and dimensions for an appropriate governance, and define the basic data and software resources that should populate this infrastructure. Multilingual coverage, the capacity to attract providers of useful and usable resources, improvements in sharing mechanisms, and collaborative working practices between R&amp;D and commercial users are key aspects. There must also be a business-friendly framework to stimulate the commercial use of these resources, based on a sound licensing facility, ease of access, ease of conversion into uniform formats. 9.2 Establish an international hub of resources and technologies for speech and The content of the infrastructure should not be limited only to data however. Instead, it has to be seen as an international hub of resources and technologies for speech and language services from industries and communities. The development of (free) tools and more generally of Web services (comparable to the Language Grid platform), including evaluation protocols and collaborative workbenches is deemed as an essential part of such a LR infrastructure. The accumulation and sharing of resources and tools in a single infrastructure would lower the cost of R&amp;D for applications in new language resource domains. 10 International cooperation Cooperation among countries and between programs is essential in driving the field forward in a coordinated way and for avoiding both the duplication of efforts and unnecessary fragmentation. The discussion of future policies and priorities for the field of LRTs is crucial not only in a European context but worldwide. This is true both when we try to highlight future directions of research, and X  X ven more so X  when we analyse the kinds of actions that are needed vis-a ` -vis infrastructure. The growth of the field must be complemented by a common effort that looks for synergies and overcomes fragmentation. 10.1 Maintain a public survey with respect to the LT and LR situation The availability of up-to-date surveys regarding the situation of LR and LT worldwide is of the utmost priority. Both the FLaReNet and META-NET projects have produced such surveys, and they should be maintained and further expanded upon. Similarly, community-driven initiatives such as the LRE Map, META-NET Language Matrixes, and the FLaReNet Network of International Contact Points are valuable assets that deserve continued maintenance and funding. 10.2 Share the effort of production of LRs between international bodies and A coordinated effort at the international level, along with the shared efforts of supra-national and national bodies, would help to provide less resourced languages with examples and best practices, for example, defining a commonly agreed on set of basic LRs that have already proven necessary for the efficient production of LTs for better represented languages. This kind of international effort should also try to identify gaps and draw up an appropriate roadmap to fill them. 10.3 Establish an international forum to share information, discuss strategies Networking and support actions must be conducted more intensively, with the establishment of international committees that have formal recognition. In a field that is both fragmented and over-structured, several interested parties have mentioned the need for an International Forum to share information, discuss strategies and declare/define common objectives. Such a Forum can play a role only if it is recognised as influential and authoritative: e.g. a Memorandum of Understanding signed by hundreds of organisations would be one of the means to bestow such authority. 11 Conclusion FLaReNet has identified a number of consensual priorities and strategic objectives for the field of LRT; these have been shared with the community through a series of publications that later evolved into the FLaReNet Strategic Language Resource Agenda. The whole community at large has been involved in this task, by means of the continuous direct consultation of key players and stakeholders, in order to reflect the widest possible range of views. Moreover, FLaReNet has maintained regular cooperation activities with relevant projects and initiatives, both non-European and European, in order to establish a kind of global coordination within the LR field. The FLaReNet recommendations target a broad spectrum of users: HLT stakeholders at large, including producers, users and developers of Language Resources and Technologies, both academic and industrial (for instance, academic or industrial researchers, service and media providers, providers of translation and localization services, etc.), funding agencies and policy-makers, at national and EC level.

The Strategic Language Resource Agenda gathers, in a coherently organized format, the major high-level recommendations collected during the many meetings, panels and consultations of the community, as well as the results of the surveying and analysis activities carried out within the framework of the EU FLaReNet project. It is therefore the result of a permanent and cyclical consultation that FLaReNet has conducted inside the community it represents X  X ith more than 300 members X  X nd outside it, through connections with neighboring projects, associ-ations, initiatives, funding agencies and government institutions. The FLaReNet principles and recommendations also represented the basis of discussion for the design of the META-SHARE platform and of the Language Resources Sharing Charter, 22 which can thus be seen as one of the first concrete embodiment of the FLaReNet Strategic Agenda.

 Abstract The main purpose of this paper is to serve as a landmark for future research and in particular for future strategic, infrastructural and coordination initiatives. It presents a preliminary plan for actions and infrastructures that could become the basis for future initiatives in the sector of Language Resources and Technologies (LRTs). The FLaReNet Language Resource Strategic Agenda presents a set of recommen-dations for the development and progress of LRT in Europe, as issued from a three-year consultation of the FLaReNet European project. Recommendations cover a broad range of topics and activities, spanning over production and use of language resources, licensing, maintenance and preservation issues, infrastructures for language resour-ces, resource identification and sharing, evaluation and validation, interoperability and policy issues. The intended recipients belong to a large set of players and stakeholders in LRT, ranging from individuals to research and education institutions, to policy-makers, funding agencies, SMEs and large companies, service and media providers. The main goal of these recommendations is to serve as an instrument to support stakeholders in planning for and addressing the urgencies of the LRT of the future. Keywords Strategic agenda Language resources planning Recommended priority actions 1 Introduction The EU has established that despite the complexities associated with handling multilingualism, cultural and linguistic differences are a unique asset and are to be preserved. Considerable investment has therefore been put into finding means, and not only those which are purely technological, of overcoming language barriers and of supporting European citizens and industry in a world that is becoming ever more influenced by globalisation. Language Resources (LRs) are critical in the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications for a multilingual society. They are also an essential component in bridging language barriers and aiding in the creation of a new environment in which information can flow more smoothly across cultural and linguistic frontiers. They represent the backbone of Language Technologies (LTs) and a great majority of industrial technological applications that handle natural language in such areas as Machine Translation, Cross-lingual Information Retrieval, etc., incorporate LRs as critical ingredients. Even if many LTs incorporate language-independent engines, they are still heavily reliant upon the availability of language-dependent knowledge in the form of LRs when it comes to their real world implementation. At the same time it has been shown time and again that a critical mass of LRs can be a major catalyst in the advancement of research and of technology development.

Nowadays with the accelerating pace of developments in LT the LR community is becoming increasingly more active. On the other hand, and in spite of the considerable technological progresses of the last decade, the challenge of overcoming the current state of fragmentation and imbalance inside the LR and LT communities is still a significant one for all languages. EU officials are particularly concerned by the fact that the most comprehensive language technology solutions in support of multilingualism are being delivered, in many cases, by large US corporations like Google and Microsoft. These companies are able to play a dominant role in the field because of their access to huge amounts of data in several different languages, alongside their considerable financial resources, massive computing power and the ability to capitalise on a direct research-to-application pipeline that utilises a new business model based on so-called  X  X  X ree X  X  services. In Europe on the other hand, the landscape is far more splintered, with some languages being relatively well served and others being offered very little support. The European LR Community stands in need of the kind of coherent approach that can only be assured through a shared commitment to a set of common aims and priorities.

This paper describes the major high-level recommendations that were collected during the three years of activity of the FLaReNet Thematic Network. FLaReNet was an EU-financed project 1 that aimed at the constitution of an international forum for the development of a much needed common vision and of a European strategy for consolidating the sector, thus enhancing competitiveness both at the EU level and worldwide. By acting as an aggregator and facilitator of information sharing and discussion, FLaReNet brought together leading experts from research institu-tions, academies, companies, consortia, associations, funding agencies, as well as a number of other public and private bodies both at the European and international levels (Fig. 1 ).

The broad participation of numerous key-figures ensured that the recommenda-tions were formulated through a consensual, bottom-up, process in which the relevant scientific, technical, organisational and strategic aspects were taken into account. The recommendations presented in this paper are the result of a permanent and cyclical consultation that FLaReNet has conducted inside the community it represents X  X ith more than 300 members X  X nd outside it, through interactions with neighbouring projects, associations, initiatives, funding agencies and government institutions.

Thanks to initiatives such as the FLaReNet project, the problem of the fragmentation of the sector is now finally starting to be tackled and a new awareness is spreading as to the necessity of joining forces and of building a stable community. If a coordinated and concerted approach is adopted X  X hat is if all interested stakeholders agree to follow a common plan of action X  X hen chances are that we can really improve the current situation for all languages. 1.1 A review of past efforts in building large LR programs In the US the systematic accumulation of large amounts of language data has been a priority since the early 90s when the rapid growth of statistical approaches to NLP helped to propagate the idea that  X  X  X here X  X  no data like more data X  X . Since then, this approach has been extended to other areas of language technology: e.g. Information Retrieval by search engines, Machine Translation, and other areas such as Computer Vision. Statistical methods paved the way for DARPA-style comparative evaluation campaigns led by the National Bureau of Standards (now known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST 2 ) starting from 1987. The growing need to gather large quantities of data in order to train statistically based systems resulted in the creation of the Linguistic Data Consortium 3 in 1992.

In Europe similar efforts to those in the US were made, in particular, with the launching of the European Language Resource Association (ELRA 4 ) in 1995. In 1998 ELRA founded the ongoing LREC series of conferences 5 in order to promote LRs and their evaluation. The importance of LRs for driving LT was also recognized by the European Commission which began a number of initiatives in the  X 90s for the development of spoken and written resources as well as for establishing standards for their representation. However, Europe missed the opportunity of creating a permanent evaluation agency comparable to NIST in the US, although a number of stakeholders including ELRA/ELDA 6 have since taken on a similar role.

As a result of the pioneering US efforts and the considerable DARPA funding of this research, (American) English has by far the best language data coverage of any language, so that many in the scientific community work mostly on English language data and report results about English language phenomena. This has meant that LTs and their applications have been steadily becoming more and more advanced for English, which in turn produces yet more data and induces the organization of yet more evaluation campaigns, including those involving the study of the metrics themselves.

The data varies considerably in the case of other languages. Some languages are relatively well covered thanks to funding programs that provide the investment needed to produce data and test systems. In the US, this is true for geopolitically significant languages (e.g. those spoken in Iraq, Afghanistan or in the Balkans). Moreover, European countries such as France, Germany and The Netherlands have given substantial funding to national programs that have helped to accelerate such kinds of research. However most of the world X  X  languages do not enjoy such levels of state support.

In some countries, language has become a major political issue, either because of a strong desire to promote certain languages (e.g. Baltic countries) or because of a constitutional obligation to preserve the languages spoken by the citizens of those countries (e.g. India and South Africa). In such cases, a country will prioritize the development of LT to order to preserve languages and ensure communication in them, even if the country itself only has limited financial resources to be able to do this. This sort of political commitment to LT in support of multilingualism is not yet typical of the European Commission, nor among the twenty seven Member States of the European Union. 1.2 The FLaReNet Strategic Agenda As we have mentioned above, LRs play a key role in the development of NLP applications for a multilingual Europe. However, realising this kind of vision requires a coordinated effort on the part of all concerned stakeholders. The FLaReNet Strategic Agenda highlights the most pressing needs for the sector and presents a set of recommendations for the development and progress of LRs in Europe. These recommendations were the result of a 3-year consultation which gathered together worldwide representatives from industry (software companies, technology providers, users), government agencies, research organisations, univer-sities, non-governmental organisations and language communities.

The FLaReNet Strategic Agenda covers a broad range of topics and activities, spanning the production and use of LRs; licensing, maintenance and preservation issues; infrastructures for LRs; resource identification and sharing; evaluation and validation; interoperability and policy issues.
 In principle this Strategic Agenda is addressed to a diverse set of stakeholders in LTs: ranging from private individuals to research and education institutions, policy-makers, funding agencies, both SMEs and large companies as well as service and media providers. Its main goal is thus to serve as an instrument to support these stakeholders in planning for and addressing the urgencies of the LTs of the future. The recommendations contained in the present document should therefore prove useful to any person or organisation X  X hether at a European, international, national, local, or private level X  X ishing to draft a program of activities for a particular community. 7
The recommendations are organised according to nine different dimensions which loosely reflect the broad thematic clusters that emerged during the FLaReNet consultations: (a) Documentation ; (b) Interoperability ; (c) Availability, Sharing and Distribution ; (d) Coverage, Quality and Adequacy ; (e) Sustainability ; (f) Recog-nition ; (g) Development ; (h) Infrastructure ; (i) International cooperation .
These directions focus on those areas where action needs to be targeted in order to make the field grow. Taken together these recommendations, if implemented, should begin to have a real impact on the development and success of LRs by contributing to the creation of a sustainable Language Resources and Technology (LRT) ecosystem where infrastructural issues interact with research and development issues, and political and strategic aspects are also taken full account of. 2 Resource documentation The need for accurate and reliable documentation of LRs is indisputable. It is still too often the case that LRs are either poorly documented or not documented at all: and even when documentation is available it is often not very easy to find. This is a pressing issue as there can be little doubt that documentation is crucial in facilitating the discovery and use of LRs. To this end the following recommendations have been made. 2.1 Develop and adopt a widely agreed standard documentation template for Documentation is essential for the use of LRs by users other than those responsible for developing the resource in the first place. The variable nature of documentation can hamper the dissemination and replication of LRs and also makes it hard for users to compare how-to files. This underlines the necessity for the establishment of common best practices and guidelines for writing documentation, and in particular for the development of standard specifications for LR documentation. Documen-tation should be as exhaustive as possible, and should include information about data formats and data content, the production context, and existing possible applications.

Human users typically need information that will help them  X  locate a resource and assess its usefulness for a given application,  X  understand the production process, the use of best practices, and the intended  X  assess the quality of a resource, replicate processes and results, and handle
On the other hand, machines need (machine-understandable) information in order to  X  discover and compare resources,  X  validate formats and annotations and process annotations appropriately,  X  retrieve relevant parts of a resource for a given use, and enable other as yet
Uniform documentation is vital. Ideally a common documentation template, after having been defined, should then be promoted and enforced for all contracts for publicly funded projects. Good documentation should include at least the following information: (a) a high-level description giving the interested but non-expert reader a good idea (b) information about the theoretical framework, background and/or the  X  X  X hilos-(c) specification of the methodology used to create the resource so that others can (d) annotation specifications (with data categories and their semantics) and (e) information about the use of standards at all levels of the development process, (f) specification of the methodology or guidelines used to assess the quality of the (g) estimates of the effort required to create the resource (in any reproducible unit, 2.2 When producing an LR, time and manpower should be allocated to In every LR production project, part of the project funding should always be allocated to documentation and dissemination activities. Policy Makers, both at the National and European level, should support activities for collecting and storing documentation for LRs in appropriate infrastructures. An effort must be made to collect all existing LR documentation and to make it easily available. To this end the design and construction of a (virtual) repository of specifications, guidelines, and documentation of LRs, starting with reference resource models or well-known and widely used resources (e.g. WordNet and the Penn TreeBank) is a priority task. 2.3 Ensure that appropriate metadata are consistently adopted for describing Ensuring that LRs are easily discoverable is the first step towards promoting a better data economy within the LRT community. Language Resource Providers should always document their resources using standard metadata and unique resource identifiers; therefore the adoption of a system of standardized metadata must be the respect would be to document resources in an open catalogue such as the ELRA Universal Catalogue, the META-SHARE or CLARIN catalogues. By providing standard APIs to query the catalogues, it would then be possible to harvest individual catalogues and compile unified catalogues via metadata aggregation. Policy makers for their part must support metadata creation by means of promotional activities. At the European level for instance there should be an established set of guidelines and rules for the description of available LRs using metadata.
 2.4 Set up a global infrastructure of common and uniform and/or interoperable One of the main reasons why it is currently so difficult to find resources that match specific needs and languages is the lack of compatibility between different sets of metadata. Different sub-communities, data distribution centers, archiving institu-tions and projects, and other providers will often use distinct, non-interoperable, metadata sets to describe their data X  X ften at different levels of granularity. It is essential therefore to work towards the full interoperability of metadata sets. It is also important to move towards the creation of machine-understandable metadata that can be processed automatically and which has a formally defined syntax and semantics. This will make metadata accessible from a greater range of software tools and allow it to be used for a greater variety of purposes. Ideally, formalized metadata elements should be used as much as possible by LR Providers and should incorporate all those aspects of the documentation of a LR that can be formalized. At the same time data categories used in metadata and in data should be registered in a data category registry in order to ensure semantic interoperability. The development of techniques for automating the process of metadata creation would also help spread the adoption of machine-understandable metadata. 2.5 Develop and support community-wide initiatives Some useful current initiatives in this direction include documentation based initiatives such as the LRE Map 8 thanks to which the widespread documentation of existing resources has been achieved within a limited time frame and with an economy of effort. The LRE Map initiative has the additional advantage that all resources are documented in a uniform and standard-compliant way. 3 Resource interoperability The interoperability of resources refers to the extent to which LRs are compatible in the sense of allowing, for instance, the merging of data that derives from different LRs, while preserving the semantics of each resource. Today the absence of interoperability between LRs and their lack of compliance with standards has a substantial monetary cost. For instance it is estimated that buyers and providers of translation services can lose anything from 10 to 40 % of their budgets or revenues due to the fact that LRs are not stored in compatible standard formats (van der Meer 2011 ). The following recommendations are intended to remedy this state of affairs. 3.1 Ensure syntactic and semantic interoperability of language resources Syntactic interoperability is the capacity of different systems to process exchanged data either directly or via trivial conversion; semantic interoperability on the other hand is the capacity of systems to interpret exchanged linguistic information in meaningful and consistent ways via reference to a common set of reference categories (Ide and Pustejovsky 2010 ). Interoperability of resources and data is also an essential prerequisite for the successful exploitation of the massive amounts of data that internet has made available during the past two decades. Efficient access to data along with sufficiently interlinked data is as important as the actual quantity of data itself, and data interoperability is an essential prerequisite here. A collective exercise to evaluate (and possibly measure) interoperability could be set up as an  X  X  X nteroperability challenge X  X , 9 under the form of an international initiative to evaluate and possibly measure interoperability. The design of interoperability tasks is the result of the collaboration between FLaReNet and US project SILT (Ide et al. 2009 ), and is envisaged as an overall challenge that explicitly requires the use and integration of multiple data formats, annotation schemes, and processing modules, so that players will be highly motivated to adapt, adopt, use standards and common formats and could start seeing the big advantages they offer. Such an initiative will also help to determine which emerging standards are the useful in promoting interoperability. As a side effect interoperability tests can also foreseeably replace certain aspects of validation. 3.2 Create a permanent standards observatory or standards watch While it is becoming widely recognised that standards are key to resource sharing, re-usability, maintainability and long-term preservation, LR providers on the whole still tend to lack a clear understanding of why standards are of assistance in representing data X  X s well as of some of the other important advantages that come from adopting standards. As a result many types of resources and many kinds of annotations are not standardised. Most existing resources are based on unique representation formats and conventions meaning that other users must first understand the format of a given resource and then instantiate ad hoc conversions prior to using the resource data for their own activities. This makes it especially difficult to draw on different sources in order to build on-demand resources such as are required by emerging web technologies.

The lack of standardisation also makes it difficult to evaluate the quality and value of resources for a given application. A basic level of standardisation is particularly vital for so-called  X  X  X ess-resourced X  X  Languages. One solution would be to work towards the establishment of a broad-based framework for the interoper-ability of LRs and LTs, a process that should include the participation of industry thus ensuring that there is broad-based adoption of standards. There should also be a greater awareness of the importance of standards for resource producers/managers who are attracted by the prospect of joining the open-access community in order to boost the utilisation of their resources, thereby increasing visibility and attracting more users and funding. An initial step towards these goals has been made by FLaReNet with the production of a document (Calzolari et al. 2011a ) that presents an overview of the current scene with the view to creating an Interoperability Framework. This document should act as a reference point for the standards that are currently being promoted for adoption by the community. 3.3 Invest in standardisation activities Investment in standardisation activities at the supra-national level is of the utmost importance. In particular, support must be given to infrastructural activities for collecting and disseminating information on existing standards and best practices. At the same time, activities for setting up new standards where they do not exist should also be funded. 3.4 Encourage/enforce use of best practices or standards in LR production It is important that community and funding agencies join forces so as to push forward the use of existing and emerging standards, at least in those areas where there is some degree of consensus (e.g. external descriptive metadata, meta-models, part-of-speech and morpho-syntactic information, etc.). The only way to ensure useful feedback so that current and emerging standards can be improved and advanced is to use these standards on a regular basis. The enforcement and promotion of standards at all stages of LR production, from basic standardisation for less-resourced languages (such as orthography normalization, transcription of oral data, etc.) to more complex areas (such as syntax, semantics, etc.) is of crucial importance. LR providers, for their part, should look out for those standards and best practices that best fit the LRs to be produced, right from early design/specification stages and then use these standards and practices to guide the production of LRs that are easily amenable to reuse (e.g. adopt formats that allow easy reuse). The creation of  X  X  X fficial X  X  validator roles to check the compliance of LRs with basic linguistic standards is an activity that must be pursued and encouraged by funding agencies. Educational activities, such as training initiatives to promote and disseminate standards amongst students and young researchers, are an important and effective means of enforcing a  X  X  X tandards culture X  X . 3.5 Make standards operational and put them in use As most users are not very concerned about whether or not they are using standards, there should be easy-to-use tools that help them to apply standards while hiding most of the technical details. The goal would be to have standards operating in the background as  X  X  X ntrinsic X  X  properties of a piece of LT or as one of the more generic tools that people/end-users use. LR providers should encourage the building of tools that enable the use of standards and work towards increasing the availability of sharable/exchangeable data. Funding agencies, on the other hand, should fund the development and/or maintenance of tools that support/enforce/validate standards. 3.6 Identify newly mature areas for standardisation and promote joint efforts There should be a regular examination of new fields to check whether they are  X  X  X ature X  X  enough to start a standardisation initiative (for instance semantic roles and spatial language). A joint effort between academia and industry will be advanta-geous towards this end and thus should also be promoted. 4 Resource availability: sharing and distribution By availability here we refer to the extent to which a given resource is actually made available for use by third parties. This implies decisions about licensing and business models. 4.1 Opt for the openness of LRs, especially publicly funded ones There is strong impulse nowadays towards open data in the sense of data that is easily obtainable and can be used with few if any restrictions. More precisely, according to the Open Knowledge Foundation data is open if  X  X  X ou are free to use, reuse, and distribute it X  X ubject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and share-alike X  X .  X  X  X roducers of data will benefit from opening it to broad access and will prefer to deposit their data with confidence in reliable repositories (Giaretta 2011 ) X  X . The LR community has started to embrace the view presented in the Giaretta quote seeing open data as digital resources that are distributed under open source-type licenses which allow them to be used, modified (and redistributed).

While the majority of LR experts advocate that data be openly available and reusable, only 55 % of the resources documented by the LRE Map are freely available. Reluctance towards fully embracing an open data model still seems to be common. It appears however that the availability of massive quantities of open data could transform the NLP industry, for example in the case of translation technologies (van der Meer 2011 ).

A study by KPMG on the Canadian Spatial Data Infrastructure (Sears 2001 ) concluded that closed, restricted data can cause major economic harm:  X  X  X he consequences [of cost recovery] for businesses are higher marginal costs, lower research and development investments and threatened marginal products. The results for consumers are negative: higher prices and reduced products and services. The overall economic consequences ... are fewer jobs, reduced economic output by almost $2.6 billion and a lower gross domestic product. X  X 
At least one branch of Language Technology, Question Answering, has benefited greatly from the availability of open data resources, especially the research datasets created for the yearly TREC question answering track. Sharing resources, both data and tools, has become a viable means of encouraging open data, and the community is strongly investing in facilities for the discovery and use of resources by its federated members. These facilities, such as the META-SHARE infrastructure, 10 represent an optimal intermediate solution responding to the need for data variety, ease of retrieval, better data description and community-wide access, while at the same time helping to bypass some of the intricate issues associated with IPR. 11 4.2 Ensure that publicly funded resources are publicly available either free of The results of a questionnaire carried out by FLaReNet strongly supported the idea that at least those resources developed with public funding should be made openly available. For mixed-funded initiatives (private/public), it should be ensured from the beginning that there is an agreement to make resources available at fair market conditions.

Another suggestion is to secure the openness of resources for most types of uses, making use of standardised licenses where available, and creating LRs in collaborative projects where resources are exchanged among project participants after production. Of course, certain types of data are and will probably remain non-shareable, either because they contain personal data, or for confidentiality or reasons of competition. Non-shared data can still be exploited however, for instance through shared services. In the meantime, it is important to define appropriate criteria for different levels of openness and to define  X  X  X est practices X  X  for making resources available that address different constraints that may be faced. 4.3 Clear intellectual property rights at the early stages of production; try to Authors do not yet have a sufficient grasp of the relevant EU trans-border legal issues supporting enhanced resource sharing and legally protecting LRs against improper reuse, copying, modification etc. The Berne Convention for the Protection of Library and Artistic Works extends copyright protection to creators in countries other than their own, but enforcement is still a national issue and is therefore implemented in different ways. In addition to this, the availability and use of huge quantities of web data as useful resources creates a novel situation that raises further legal problems.

On the one hand IPRs (especially authorship) need to be protected; but on the other they tend to restrict accessibility to and usability of LRs. The current trend is towards a culture of free/open use with less protective holders X  rights. Creative Commons, for example, is one of the most widely used license models for LR (see Google, Wikipedia, Whitehouse.gov, Public Library of Science, and Flickr). From a practical point of view, producers of LRs should try to clear IPR at the early stages of production, ensuring that re-use is permitted. 4.4 Educate key players in basic legal know how It is crucial to disseminate a certain amount of legal knowledge/know-how in order to educate all (major) players in the LRT area. It is also important to acquaint a number of lawyers of community concerns so they can develop adequate frameworks to address such issues. Moreover, it is important that such legal experts are asked to intervene in the initial phases of resource production, in order to ensure that all legal (and also ethical, privacy and other) aspects are taken into consideration when planning for long-term LR sharing and distribution. 4.5 Elaborate specific, simple and harmonized licensing solutions for data The community should avoid one-size-fits-all solutions. There are a large number of licensing schemes already in use today, some are backed by strong players (ELRA, LDC, open source communities such as Creative Commons, 12 GNU General Public License, etc.), others have been drafted bilaterally and in some cases by the legal departments of data providers. It is crucial that such licensing is harmonized and even standardized. Licensing schemes need to be simplified through broad-based solutions for both R&amp;D and industry. Electronic licensing (e-licenses) should be adopted and current distribution models to new media (web, mobile devices, etc.) should be accepted. 5 Resource coverage, quality, adequacy With the current data-driven paradigm in force, innovation in LT crucially depends on LRs.

Emphasis is increasingly being placed upon the high quality and large size of resources, and as production (still) takes a lot of effort and is very costly, development of resources for future technologies and applications must start now in order to positively impact the development of multilingual technologies. As stated by (Mladenic and Grobelnik 2011 ),  X  X  X he development of killer applications crucially depends on the availability of large quantities of data. Cross-lingual knowledge extraction, for instance, is a challenging high impact task for the near and mid future. Today, the tasks seems to be achievable because critical mass of technology is collected X  X .

Despite the vast amount of academic and industrial investment, there are not enough resources available to satisfy the needs of all languages, quantitatively and qualitatively. LRs should be produced and made available for every language, every register, every domain to guarantee full coverage, high quality and adequacy for the various LT applications. We need the right amount, the right type and the right quality of resources. 5.1 Increase quantity of resources available to address language and application Dependence on data creates new disparities for under-resourced languages and domains. It is estimated that 95 % of web pages are written in the top 20 most spoken languages (Pimienta et al. 2009 ): naturally, smaller language communities produce much less data than speakers of more dominant languages. The same problems occur for language data in narrow domains with their own specific terminological and stylistic requirements. To ensure Universal Linguistic Rights and the massive deployment of LT applications, language services should be provided for everyone in his or her own mother tongue. Funding must be found to cover all languages (including the world X  X  less-well represented languages) in future multilingual applications in order to develop LRs for all languages. The provision of high quality resources for all European languages, including minority ones, must be a priority now in order to avoid disparity in the future. 5.2 Implement BLARKs for all languages, especially less-resourced ones For the particular advancement of LTs, Basic Language Resource Kits 13 (or BLARKs) should be supported and developed for all languages, and at least for the main areas of LT application (Machine Translation, Information Retrieval, Question Answering to mention a few). Many undocumented languages are at high risk of becoming extinct in the digital age, and therefore such minority and fringe languages should be comprehensively represented through spoken and written corpora and manuscripts in these languages should be digitized.

In order to move in this direction, the BLaRK concept firstly needs to be worked out in detail so that it can be embodied as a standard, and planned revision sessions should be arranged; this is because it is an intrinsically dynamic notion that changes over time with the change in technology development in different countries. Secondly, regular BLaRK surveys must be conducted in order to produce a clear picture of technology trends, and establish (and regularly update) a roadmap covering all aspects of LTs. Thirdly, resource production should be funded on the basis of BLaRK-like criteria, i.e., giving priority to the development of  X  X  X issing X  X  resource types for each language. 5.3 Provide high quality resources for all European languages High quality resources should be regarded as a key driver for effective technology in broad areas (e-content, media, health, automotive, telecoms, etc.). To this end and to reduce the amount of human intervention and revision, automatic techniques should be promoted to guarantee quality through error detection and confidence assess-ment. The promotion of validation and evaluation can play a valuable role in fostering the improvement of formal and content quality of resources. 5.4 Devise new methods for LR quality check New tools should be developed and the maximal use of existing tools should be ensured with respect to the automatic or semi-automatic formal and content validation of LRs. LR quality requirements should be assessed by a think-tank composed of recognized experts representing a broad spectrum from within the LR community. The community along with policy makers should ensure that a quick quality check can be carried out, at least for existing resources. Projects/players should be encouraged to specify a validation procedure before LR production starts. A  X  X  X uality Seal of Approval X  X , along the lines of the  X  X  X ata Seal of Approval X  X  should be defined and endorsed by the community. 5.5 Establish a European evaluation and validation body Evaluation in Europe is currently carried out by individual institutions (such as ELDA and CELCT 14 ) and by short-term projects (e.g. the TC-STAR 15 and CHIL campaigns 16 ), but there is no sustained European-wide coordination, as there is in the US (NIST) or Japan (NII 17 ). In specific areas, the community has organised itself to carry out regular evaluations (e.g. CLEF 2000 X 2010, 18 and Semeval 19 )but with limited funding and a lot of community good will. It is of the utmost importance to establish common and standard LT evaluation procedures in Europe. The establishment of such procedures would boost research around evaluation measures, as has already happened in the US. 5.6 Create an infrastructure for coordinated LRT evaluation The creation of a European infrastructure enabling a coordinated evaluation of LRTs is a priority. Setting up an evaluation management and coordination structure would ensure a viable, consistent and coherent programme of activities that can successfully scale up and embrace new communities and technological paradigms. This should be coupled with the establishment of a sustainable technical infrastructure providing data, tools and services to carry out systematic evaluation. This could be a distributed infrastructure involving existing organizations. 5.7 Carry out evaluation in real-world scenarios Evaluation should encompass technologies, resources, guidelines and documenta-tion. But like the technologies it addresses, evaluation is constantly evolving, and new, more specific measures using innovative methodologies are needed to evaluate, for example, the reliability of semantic annotations. Current evaluation campaigns sometimes create rather artificial settings in order to stay  X  X cademically clean X , making the tasks they measure somewhat unrealistic. One of the most critical challenges, therefore, is to introduce new types of campaigns, possibly based on task-based evaluation. 5.8 Promote evaluation and validation activities of LRs and the dissemination of In order to foster evaluation activities it is important that they be regarded as a major research topic (encompassing research on metrics, methodologies, etc.) and especially as the potential subject for a PhD. Thorough dissemination of activities and achievements should be carried out through LRT evaluation portals (e.g. the ELRA HLT evaluation portal 20 ). 5.9 Assess the maturity of technologies for which resources can be developed It is important to assess the availability of existing resources with respect to their adequacy for current applications and technology requirements. This involves assessing the maturity of the technologies for which new resources should be developed. We recommend, to this end, closely monitoring research developments through publications and patent filing, and drawing up a list of the top 20 technologies in order to ensure that crucial resources are developed in at least ten of these, in a publicly and fully funded framework. Regular evaluation campaigns to assess the progress made by such technologies with respect to the state-of-the art is also desirable, especially if conducted within an evaluation framework along the lines depicted above. 6 Resource sustainability Sustainability covers preservation, accessibility, and operability (among other things) all of which mutually influence one another. Currently, most (data and software) resource building and distribution is based on short-term projects, which often leads to the loss of resources when these projects are over. LRs must be accessible over the long term. This means (a) archiving and preserving the data by the production unit, and also archiving them off-site (e.g. in very-long term archiving/data centres); (b) maintaining LRs in an appropriate way; and (c) making sure that linguistic tools and resources are sustainable, e.g. by requesting resource accessibility and usability for a given time frame. The FLaReNet project has developed an analytic model of sustainability in which extrinsic and intrinsic factors are taken into account. 21 Use of this or similar models should be fostered by the entire community. A sustainability analysis must thus be part of a resource X  X  specification phase, and it is important that funding agencies impose a mandatory sustainability plan for those projects that are concerned with production of LRs. 7 Resource recognition LRs (both data and software) are time-consuming, costly and increasingly require a considerable share of research budgets. The entire ecosystem around LRs needs substantial support and recognition. Small labs and individual researchers are not keen on depositing or sharing their resources because so far there has been little incentive to do so. There are almost no rewards for researchers and institutions from sharing, preserving and maintaining resources, and this now poses a number of serious problems. 7.1 Develop a standard protocol for citing LRs LRs deserve credit and should be cited in a similar way to sources in scientific publications using a standard citation framework for which LR providers will be responsible and receive credit (this would also enforce the use of minimal metadata descriptions). Use of an International Standard Language Resource Number is especially encouraged (Choukri et al. 2012 ). A  X  X  X anguage Resources Impact Factor X  X  along the lines of similar metrics used in other fields especially in Biology, should be defined in order to enforce the practice of the citation of resources on the model of scientific paper authoring and to calculate the actual research impact of resources. 7.2 Support training in production and use of LRs There should be more training in the production and use of LRs, and LRs should be used more widely in education. In fact training in the production and use of LRs should become part of the curricula especially in Computational Linguistics and NLP. 8 Resource development Development of LRs refers to the entire production cycle of a resource. The proper management of the  X  X  X ife cycle X  X  of LR creation has attracted less attention than it should and has been largely overlooked in our community. 8.1 Ensure strong public and community support for the definition and A reference model for creating LRs will help to address the current shortage of resources in terms of breadth (languages and applications) and depth (data quality and volume). Such a reference model should also include an accurate estimate of production costs. 8.2 Go green: enforce recycling, reusing and repurposing The creation of new resources from scratch should be discouraged wherever resources are already available for a given language and/or application. We should encourage re-use and re-purposing as part of a  X  X  X ecycling X  X  culture in order to ensure the reuse of development methods, existing tools, and translation/transliteration tools, etc. 8.3 Work towards the full automation of LR data production With production costs constantly increasing, there is a real need to invest in innovative production methods that involve automatic procedures to a substantial degree in order to reduce human intervention to a minimum. We must improve existing tools and introduce new automation techniques, especially for higher-level semantic, content-related and multilingual tasks. As stated by (Vasiljevs 2011 ), the coverage problem is so great that it is necessary to promote strategies that approach or ensure full automation for (high-quality) LR data production:  X  X  X nnovation needs data, but also the collection of data needs innovation X  X . We must also foster the evaluation of real-life applications so that research can gradually approach industry needs in terms of information volume and granularity. Support must be given to academic and industrial involvement in research on automatic methods for production and validation of LRs, in order to allow a more accurate assessment of automatic methods for building LRs for real-life applications. 8.4 Invest in Web 2.0/3.0 methods for collaborative creation and extension of Given the high cost of language resource production, and the fact that in many cases it is impossible to avoid the manual construction of resources (e.g. if accurate models are requested or if there is to be reliable evaluation) it is worth considering the power of social/collaborative media to build resources: especially for those languages where no LRs have yet been built by experts. Several experiments in crowd-sourcing data collection and NLP tasks have been conducted recently (Dolan 2011 ), and most of them look promising. For instance, it has been estimated that Mechanical Turk translation is 10 X 60 times less expensive than professional translation (Callison-Burch and Dredze 2010 ). Production and annotation of LRs can be carried out as collaborative projects. Existing LRs should be  X  X  X pened up X  X  for collaborative annotation and reuse of annotated results. At the same time, new tools are to be developed and existing tools are to be adapted to the needs of collaborative work. However, the use of crowd-sourcing raises ethical, sociological and practical issues for the community. It is not yet clearly understood for example whether all types of LRs can be obtained collaboratively by using na X   X  ve annotators; more research is therefore needed on both the technical (e.g. accurately comparing the quality and content of resources built collaboratively and those built by experts) and ethical aspects of crowd-sourcing, see for instance (Zaidan and Callison-Burch 2011 ) about mechanisms for increasing quality of crowd-sourced data. 8.5 Collaborative and Web 2.0 methods for data collection and annotation A particularly sensitive case is that of less-resourced languages, where language technology should be developed rapidly to help minority-language speakers to access education and the Information Society. Basic LRs for all the world X  X  languages could be created through the building of a Web 2.0 site (using the same community computing power that generates millions of blogs) starting with the 446 languages currently present on the web. Collaborative and Web 2.0 methods for data collection and annotation seem particularly very well-suited for collecting the data needed for the development of Language Technology applications.

Currently there are insufficient resources for solving the problem of creating free, large-scale resources for the world X  X  languages, even for those with a reasonable web presence. The collaborative accumulation and creation of data appears to be the best and most practicable way to achieve better and faster language coverage; indeed, in purely economic terms it could well deliver a higher return on investment than so far expected. 9 An infrastructure of language resources As a matter of fact, researchers and developers still have to spend large amounts of time consulting multiple catalogues or searching the web to find relevant LRs and very often fail to do so. For various reasons available resources are often very difficult to access. Some are available from distribution centres (notably ELRA and LDC), others from associations or project portals, or directly from the web pages of the laboratories or researchers who developed the resource. In many cases, unless the potential user already knows certain details about the resource such as the name, owner or project, he or she will find it difficult to discover new or as yet unknown resources. The identification and discovery of  X  X  X ew/unknown X  X  resources is therefore currently a key priority and calls for the spread of a new culture of sharing and/or collaborative resource creation.

The need for an infrastructure for LRs was the first recommendation made at the beginning of FLaReNet and derives historically from the recognition of the infrastructural role of LRs as essential  X  X  X uilding blocks X  X  for LTs. A small number of infrastructure initiatives (cf. CLARIN, META-SHARE) have emerged in order to solve these problems. However, without proper coordination between these initiatives, there is a risk of further fragmentation. An additional problem is that some of the current  X  X  X nfrastructure plans X  X  are projects with a limited time duration. It is therefore time to act more decisively to build synergy between all the stakeholders in this field. 9.1 Build a sustainable facility for discovering, accessing and sharing data and Broad participation is essential in building an i nfrastructure. This infrastructure will help, in primis , to make LRs available, visible and easily accessible. Second, the infrastructure will facilitate the sharing and exchange of LR s. An initiative of this kind needs sustained support by policy makers to ensure steady dev elopment; also, promotional activities on the side of LR providers are necessary to secure visibility and participation.
The basic principles of an infrastructure for LRs and technologies require the adoption of a community approach that brings together and builds upon current experiences and endeavours. It is necessary to define and agree upon the basic criteria and dimensions for an appropriate governance, and define the basic data and software resources that should populate this infrastructure. Multilingual coverage, the capacity to attract providers of useful and usable resources, improvements in sharing mechanisms, and collaborative working practices between R&amp;D and commercial users are key aspects. There must also be a business-friendly framework to stimulate the commercial use of these resources, based on a sound licensing facility, ease of access, ease of conversion into uniform formats. 9.2 Establish an international hub of resources and technologies for speech and The content of the infrastructure should not be limited only to data however. Instead, it has to be seen as an international hub of resources and technologies for speech and language services from industries and communities. The development of (free) tools and more generally of Web services (comparable to the Language Grid platform), including evaluation protocols and collaborative workbenches is deemed as an essential part of such a LR infrastructure. The accumulation and sharing of resources and tools in a single infrastructure would lower the cost of R&amp;D for applications in new language resource domains. 10 International cooperation Cooperation among countries and between programs is essential in driving the field forward in a coordinated way and for avoiding both the duplication of efforts and unnecessary fragmentation. The discussion of future policies and priorities for the field of LRTs is crucial not only in a European context but worldwide. This is true both when we try to highlight future directions of research, and X  X ven more so X  when we analyse the kinds of actions that are needed vis-a ` -vis infrastructure. The growth of the field must be complemented by a common effort that looks for synergies and overcomes fragmentation. 10.1 Maintain a public survey with respect to the LT and LR situation The availability of up-to-date surveys regarding the situation of LR and LT worldwide is of the utmost priority. Both the FLaReNet and META-NET projects have produced such surveys, and they should be maintained and further expanded upon. Similarly, community-driven initiatives such as the LRE Map, META-NET Language Matrixes, and the FLaReNet Network of International Contact Points are valuable assets that deserve continued maintenance and funding. 10.2 Share the effort of production of LRs between international bodies and A coordinated effort at the international level, along with the shared efforts of supra-national and national bodies, would help to provide less resourced languages with examples and best practices, for example, defining a commonly agreed on set of basic LRs that have already proven necessary for the efficient production of LTs for better represented languages. This kind of international effort should also try to identify gaps and draw up an appropriate roadmap to fill them. 10.3 Establish an international forum to share information, discuss strategies Networking and support actions must be conducted more intensively, with the establishment of international committees that have formal recognition. In a field that is both fragmented and over-structured, several interested parties have mentioned the need for an International Forum to share information, discuss strategies and declare/define common objectives. Such a Forum can play a role only if it is recognised as influential and authoritative: e.g. a Memorandum of Understanding signed by hundreds of organisations would be one of the means to bestow such authority. 11 Conclusion FLaReNet has identified a number of consensual priorities and strategic objectives for the field of LRT; these have been shared with the community through a series of publications that later evolved into the FLaReNet Strategic Language Resource Agenda. The whole community at large has been involved in this task, by means of the continuous direct consultation of key players and stakeholders, in order to reflect the widest possible range of views. Moreover, FLaReNet has maintained regular cooperation activities with relevant projects and initiatives, both non-European and European, in order to establish a kind of global coordination within the LR field. The FLaReNet recommendations target a broad spectrum of users: HLT stakeholders at large, including producers, users and developers of Language Resources and Technologies, both academic and industrial (for instance, academic or industrial researchers, service and media providers, providers of translation and localization services, etc.), funding agencies and policy-makers, at national and EC level.

The Strategic Language Resource Agenda gathers, in a coherently organized format, the major high-level recommendations collected during the many meetings, panels and consultations of the community, as well as the results of the surveying and analysis activities carried out within the framework of the EU FLaReNet project. It is therefore the result of a permanent and cyclical consultation that FLaReNet has conducted inside the community it represents X  X ith more than 300 members X  X nd outside it, through connections with neighboring projects, associ-ations, initiatives, funding agencies and government institutions. The FLaReNet principles and recommendations also represented the basis of discussion for the design of the META-SHARE platform and of the Language Resources Sharing Charter, 22 which can thus be seen as one of the first concrete embodiment of the FLaReNet Strategic Agenda.
