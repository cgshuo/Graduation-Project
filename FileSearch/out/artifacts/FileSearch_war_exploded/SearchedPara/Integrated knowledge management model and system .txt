 1. Introduction
In recent decades, the scenario of construction projects has become more complicated, dynamic and interactive. Project managers are constantly required to speed up reflective decision-makings on time. Knowledge, therefore, is noted to be one of the most important resources contributing to managerial decision-making and enhancing the competitive advantage of organisations carrying out such projects ( Carrillo, 2004 ; Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995).

The construction industry is a workplace that is dominated by heuristics. Construction companies and their personnel prefer to carry out their project management tasks on the basis of their past experiences rather than on a textbook approach or established analytical approaches ( Maqsood, 2006 ). Indeed the costs of attracting, recruiting and retaining talented employees are expensive. This is further complicated by the fact that, in coming years, the construction industry is expected to lose a large portion of its skilled and knowledgeable workforce. Conversely, there is no single strategy in place to handle the construction management problems that arise. One of the most effective and powerful tools for strengthening industrial and organisational competition is through systematic identification, as per the best practice of knowledge utilisation and distribution ( Bahra, 2001 ; Kamara et al., 2002).

Knowledge has been described as information which has been used and integrated with a person X  X  knowledge-based experience and behavioural patterns ( DeTienne, 2001 ). Individuals have different knowledge-based capacities and experiences, and these lead to different approaches for problem-solving and decision-making. Knowledge and experience are significant when choosing a construction project manager ( Ogunlana et al., 2002 ). Therefore project managers must be capable of knowing how to use, manage and utilise such knowledge.

A traditional practice in project management is to analyse alternatives based on economic, legal/regulatory, technical, technological, organisational and managerial approaches. Social, cultural, ethical, psychological and educational aspects of project management are less important. In order to make an integrated analysis of a project management life cycle, such a cycle must be analysed in an integrated manner using the system of criteria (see Fig. 1 ).

Before specifying knowledge management (KM) models, first the KM concept has to be defined. However, KM has been defined in different ways in scientific literature. According to Quintas et al. (1997) , KM means to manage all knowledge continuously to meet various requirements in an organisation. Coleman (1999) defines
KM as an umbrella term referring to a wide variety of interdependent and interlocking functions consisting of knowl-edge creation, knowledge valuation and metrics, knowledge mapping and indexing, knowledge transport, storage and distribution and knowledge sharing. Gurteen (1998) comprehen-sively defined KM as an emerging set of organisational design and operational principles, processes, organisational structures, appli-cations and technologies that helps knowledge employees dramatically leverage their creativity and ability to deliver business value.

According to Robinson (2005) , knowledge management relates to unlocking and leveraging different types of knowledge so that it becomes available as an organisational asset. Implementing KM enables an organisation to learn from its corporate memory, share knowledge and identify competencies in order to become a forward thinking and learning organisation.

Other authors mentioned additional KM benefits to project management. Kamara et al. (2002) and Love et al. (2003) state that the role of effective management of knowledge is evident in producing innovation, reducing project time and improving quality and customer satisfaction. According to Siemieniuch and
Sinclair (1999) , through knowledge management, an organisa-tion X  X  intangible assets can be better exploited to create value, while both internal and external knowledge are being leveraged to the benefit of the organisation. In projects knowledge manage-ment can improve communications within teams and provide more informed knowledge by sharing best practice documents, lessons learned, project management and system engineering methodologies, examples of review packages and rationales for strategic decisions. It is possible to distinguish KM benefits such as productive information use, activity improvement, intelligence enhancement, intellectual capital storage, strategic planning, flexibility acquisition, best practice gathering, success probability enhancement and productive collaboration. The authors here used the systemised approach to KM definition (see Fig. 2 ).
The different definitions of KM in literature result from the various perspectives and contexts that are specific to the authors and their research fields. Within construction KM can be difficult to define precisely, as there is no general consensus on a single unified meaning of the concept. However, Egbu (2004) explains that knowledge is an important resource for construction organisations due to its ability to provide market leverage and contributions to organisational innovations and project success. The idea of knowledge as a competitive resource within project-oriented industries is a concept shared by numerous authors such as Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) , Egbu (2004) , Egbu et al. (2001) , Oltra (2005) and others.

The potential benefits of effectively utilising their knowledge has meant that an increasing number of construction companies have identified the need to implement KM initiatives. However, the difficulties associated with understanding and managing organisational knowledge has meant that organisations experi-ence numerous problems in successfully implementing and sustaining their initiatives ( Egbu, 2004 ; Oltra, 2005 ). Egbu et al. (2001) state that, due to the project-oriented nature of construc-tion organisations, cultural considerations are important for successful KM. They continue by stating that short-term, task-focused work can promote a culture which inhibits continuous learning.

It can be concluded that, though academics and industrial organisations have recognised the need for KM, there can be confusion over specific definitions of knowledge and KM within construction organisations. As a result there is the danger that KM initiatives can become misguided and not serve their desired purpose. It is important for the entire organisation to understand what KM is and why it is important. The organisation should adopt a recognised and accepted generic definition, apply it to its specific context and tailor it to accommodate specific business objectives. This will require support, agreement and communica-tions from the top. To ensure an alignment with its business objectives and strategies, an organisation should consider the type of work they carry out, their culture, dynamics and policies and practices, as well as the added value that is required from the KM initiative ( Bishop et al., 2008 ).

Based on these assumptions, the authors of this paper are aiming to develop a generalised and easily adaptive Integrated Knowledge Management model which is presented further.
Various scientific works describe knowledge management through structured models. Models introduced by various authors and used in various activities have been analysed (see Table 1 ). Most of the presented models are usually activity oriented. Four major dimensions for the process of KM activities presented by Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) and Davenport and Prusak (1998) are usually adopted for the general structure of KM models in enterprises. These four dimensions are knowledge creation, knowledge diffusion, knowledge transfer and knowledge inven-tory. In the proposed generic model, Korsvold and Ramstad (2004) distinguish three necessary arenas for knowledge development identified as  X  X  X ollective knowing X  X , relational knowledge and knowing how. Consequently, the relationship between these three conditions or the knowledge content of the arenas for knowledge creation in constituting a generic model for creating organisational innovation in the operative accomplishment of the building process as a whole is intrinsically dynamic and inter-dependent. This implies a continuous process of internalisation and externalisation between tacit (embedded knowledge: the common frame of reference as a Web-based communicative and reflective device in the operative accomplishment of the building process) and encultured knowledge (encultured: the common frame of reference as shared collective understanding of the building process as a whole).

It should be noted, however, that not very many of the proposed models are adapted for the construction sector.
Research by Teerajetgul and Charoenngam (2006) addressed the concerns of practicing knowledge management in construc-tion projects by examining the relationships between knowledge factors and the knowledge creation process composed of socialisation, externalisation, combination and internalisation. A framework was employed to test these relationships, and the empirical evidence supported the relationships. Findings from this study confirmed that three selected factors (IT, incentive and individual competency) affected the overall knowledge creation process in Thai construction projects. From the research results, it can be assumed that KM in construction projects is impossible without IT and human interaction.

Tserng and Lin (2004) presented a more detailed framework of knowledge management used in construction projects. These authors distinguished three spheres of KM in construction projects  X  content management, experience management and process management  X  and six management stages: problem happening, create knowledge, share knowledge, record knowledge, knowledge storage and knowledge reused.
 The significance of knowledge management in the construction industry has been proved, as well as researched in academic literature. Indeed different authors present diverse approaches to knowledge management, as well as different knowledge management models, theories (community of practice, social network analysis, intellectual capital, information theory, com-plexity science and constructivism) and strategies the adjustment of which for the construction industry sometimes lacks an integrated approach.

Construction organisations use various knowledge management strategies: experts databases; cros s construction project learning; active knowledge management (this knowledge management strategy is also referred to as the push strategy or codification approach); knowledge requests of experts (this knowledge management strategy is also referred to as the pull strategy or personalization approach); knowledge mapping; rewards (to motivate experts to share their knowledge); communities of practice; best practice transfer; competence management (contin-uous employee qualification imp rovement and assessment in organisations); expert-apprentice relationship; groupware technol-ogies; knowledge databases and bookmarking engines; intellectual capital; knowledge brokers; social e-network; storytelling (transfer of tacit knowledge); after construction project reviews, etc. Some of these strategies (community of practice, social network and intellectual capital) are part of various knowledge management models and theories.

Above models and theories, as well as their application in construction, are briefly analysed in next paragraphs.
Social network analysis is the mapping and measuring of links and relationships between organisations and individuals engaged in
Networking or collaborative activities. It may reveal: specific expertise or influence; how people cooperate, and with whom; who is overburdened with requests for assistance; and who fails to collaborate at all. Since it provides both visual and mathematical analyses, it is a very powerful tech nique for evaluating mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, and inter-company relationships ( Quan-tum, 2009 ). Kurul (2007) analysed possibilities to evaluate knowl-edge creation capability and absorptive capacity in construction on the basis of the methodology of social network analysis. Kurul (2007) , in the project funded by EPSRC (E P/C530160/1), analysed the concepts of absorptive capacity and social capital, while analytical techniques such as social network analysis were deployed to evaluate knowledge creation capacity of project teams in the construction industry.

Community of Practice is a community or group with a common interest. Community of Practice frequently uses the internet to facilitate their activities. This facilitation may include forums, libraries, chat rooms, calendars and such as working papers, links, and a contacts directory other goodies are shared here for all to use ( Wason, 2009 ). Yu et al. (2009) present the development of the knowledge value-adding model (KVAM) for quantitative performance measurement of the community of practice of the knowledge management system in an A/E consulting firm. The proposed KVAM combines several existing
KM theories including knowledge creation spiral, knowledge chain model and knowledge value added theory to form a process-level model for measuring the performance of a generic community of practice. Love (2009) uses the normative literature to develop a proposal for using communities of practice in construction projects. An inter-organisational form of community of practice, known as  X  X  X hampions of practice, X  X  is propagated for use in the construction industry. The  X  X  X hampions of practice X  X  is developed as an active know-how platform to provide advice pertaining to issues of  X  X  X est practice X  X  that have been accumulated from projects. The creation of such a form of community of practice can provide invaluable insights about best practice, which can be formalised and shared in a meaningful and reflective way ( Love, 2009 ).

Intellectual Capital is the same as the knowledge asset of an organisation. Knowledge assets help achieve business goals. This capital is the set of intangible assets that includes the internal knowledge of employees have of information processes, external and internal experts, products, customers and competitors. Intellectual capital includes internal proprietary reports, libraries, patents, copyrights and licenses that record the company history and help it plan for tomorrow ( Stuhlman, 2009 ). Bartholomew (2008) describes developing expertise, creativity and intellectual capital in the construction professions. He shows design practices and other construction professionals how to manage knowledge successfully. Design is a knowledge-based activity, and project managers, contractors and clients, as well as architects and engineers, have always learned from experience and shared their knowledge with immediate colleagues. Increasingly sophisticated construction technology and more demanding markets are making effective management of knowledge ever more important ( Bartholomew, 2008 ).

Information theory is based on the fact that we can represent our experience by the use of symbols like the alphabet, pictures, etc. It is concerned with the problem of how to measure changes in information or knowledge content, that is, how to compile or interpret a message ( Skyttner, 1998 ). The main propositions of information theory are broadly applied in the development of knowledge management and intelligent systems for construction.
Real-world complex systems are almost always made up from a large number of interacting components. This leads to complex behaviour that is difficult to understand, predict and manage. Research on complex systems is often undertaken by mathematicians, statisticians, engineers and information and computer scientists ( Australian, 2009 ). Many large construction projects are attributed to complex systems. Therefore, accumulation of experience and knowledge, as well as its multiple reuse, in such large construction projects is of particular significance.
Many knowledge management models and theories are, in one way or another, based on variou s philosophical theories. The Constructivism Model is not an ex ception. Philosophy is dealing with knowledge since ancient times. The specified problems of the traditional knowledge theory form the nucleus of classic epistemol-ogy. Epistemology is an area of philosophical study that focuses on our understanding of knowledge. Epistemology asks questions about what is true and false, and what constitutes valid  X  X  X nformation X  X . A key question of epistemology is whether information is absolute or relative, reflecting a tension between the  X  X  X cientific method X  X  and  X  X  X ocial constructivism X  X  ( Epistemology, 2009 ). Cognitivism  X  one of the younger branches of epistemology  X  deals with consistent patterns of scientific cognition. The idea of cognitivism ( Macmillan, 2009 ) is that learning is a conscious, rational process. People learn by making models, maps and frameworks in their mind.

In cognitivism ( Jean Piaget, 2009 ) knowledge is viewed as symbolic, mental constructions in the mind of individuals and as the outcome of learning. Learning is a process of recognition which occurs with associations through contiguity and repetition. Thus, learners perceive new relations among the parts of a problem, they acquire and reorganize information into under-standable cognitive structures. Constructivist epistemology is an epistemological perspective in philosophy about the nature of scientific knowledge ( Routledge, 2000 ). Constructivism is a philosophical perspective derived from the work of Immanuel Kant which views reality as existing mainly in the mind, constructed or interpreted in terms of one X  X  own perceptions. Constructivism focuses on the process of how knowledge is built rather than on its product or object ( Constructivism, 2009 ). Constructivism is a theory of knowledge which claims that knowledge is not passively received but actively constructed by the learner, and that the function of cognition is adaptive, serving to organise experience, rather than discover reality ( Glosary, 2009 ). Constructivism is a philosophy of learning used by the leading construction organisations to master the best construc-tion practice.

This paper covers a wide range of issues from basic definitions and fundamental concepts to the role of information technology and different knowledge management models presented in literature.

Noticeably above researchers from various countries engaged in analysing knowledge management for construction projects but did not consider the object of research as analysed by the authors of this investigation. The object of this research may be described as follows: construction project stakeholders involved in its design and realisation as well as its micro-, meso-and macro-environments which have a particular impact on it and in making an integral whole. A complex analysis of the research object that was formulated and compiled with the help of multiple criteria project analysis methods was especially devel-oped by these authors for this purpose.

The main purpose of this research is to develop an integrated knowledge management model for construction projects by presenting the systematic approach to tacit and explicit knowl-edge management according to construction life cycle and micro-, meso-and macro-environmental factors as a whole and using it for the Knowledge Based Decision Support System architecture.
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2, following this introduction, explains the model for an integrated analysis of a building X  X  life cycle. Section 3 provides a practical realisation of this model. Section 4 describes the testing of the developed systems and model. Finally some concluding remarks appear in
Section 5. 2. Development of the integrated knowledge management model for construction projects
The analysis of works and published articles by various scientists shows the tendency to select a single, narrow KM area (e.g., personnel management, management of a single project phase and such). Only a few scientists attempted an integrated analysis of KM in construction. Thus there is a need to have an integrated analysis of KM in the construction sector that takes into account the entire life cycle and not only emphases explicit but also tacit knowledge as well as considers all stakeholder groups and the satisfaction of their needs.

The integrated KM model developed by the authors of this article is shown in Fig. 3 .

The effectiveness of the IKM model which is under develop-ment depends on the combined effect of macro-level variable factors such as the level of economic, political and cultural development of a country; governmental policies (regional support programmes, control of competition, preferential loans, tax exemptions, projects commissioned by the government); legal and normative documents; the tax system; the loan granting procedure; interest rates; insurance systems; the social policy; inflation; the market; unemployment level; workforce skills; salary scales; labour laws; environment protection; customs and traditions; availability of local resources and others.
The national economic environment has a direct influence on construction. It depends on the policies by national authorities on taxes and money, capital movement, the investment environ-ment, loan granting and interest rates. Demand, supply, competi-tion, pricing and other economic factors determine the economic environment as well. The main economic indicators which define economic development are the cyclical nature of development, inflation and unemployment. These affect changes in other indicators (GDP variation, consumer income, amount of savings, prices of goods, possibilities to get loans).

The social and cultural environment includes institutions and other factors which help to shape and perceive the main social values, views and behavioural standards. A human personality matures in a certain society which determines his/her main values and beliefs.

The political and legal environment has a direct influence on the construction market. The political and legal environment consists of the political system, legal acts and ownership rights.
The political and legal environment is affected by national and public agencies and organisations, as well as by other stakeholder groups. Business is especially sensitive to the degree of bureau-cracy in the system. The complex process related to issuing building permits may be taken as an example.

The technological environment relates to new technology opening paths for new markets and new opportunities. The technological environment changes rapidly. Companies which fail to foresee a technological change in advance and keep up with it are forced out of the market. Life cycles of technologies are shrinking.
The natural environment and energy saving involve a certain natural environment in which the construction and real estate sector functions thereby affecting it and being affected by it. The natural environment supplies this sector with raw materials and resources. The Lithuanian industry of construction materials and products consumes most of the electricity and other types of energy (except for the energy industry).

Low-energy technology use in construction not only will reduce emissions of pollutants which cause the greenhouse effect but also the overall building life cycle costs. Transportation and management of debris demands additional expenses on the part of construction organisations and the state.

Meso-economic analysis is the systematic analysis of the construction and real estate sector in which both private and state organisations operate.

Three types of companies (service companies, construction organisations and manufacturers o f construction materials and products) and three types of economic activities (1. management of real estate, facilities and transact ions; 2. project management and construction of buildings/structures and 3. manufacturing and supply of construction material s and products) are part of the construction and real estate sector. Service companies embrace all three types of economic activities, whereas construction companies as well as manufacturers of constru ction materials and products are involved in only one respective type of activity. Based on the usually assumed, traditional perspective, only construction organisations operate in the construction sector; the perspective of the construc-tion and real estate sector embraces activities by service companies, construction organisations and manufacturers of construction materials and products.

Whereas the construction and real estate sector is described as an open system, it is influenced by the external environment (i.e., the surroundings and regulatory documents). Meso-economics emphasises the influence of the institutional environment which is reflected by various institutional participants (starting with international institutions and ending with trade unions and tenant associations).

Different microenvironment factors must be assessed during the development of the IKM model. These factors depend on meso-and macro-level factors (various laws and normative documents regulate construction projects and so forth).
The following main micro-level factors influence the effective-ness of the IKM model: prices of parcels and buildings, local infrastructure, information systems,
Nanotechnology, integrated design of a building X  X  life cycle, improvement of the construction materials and products supply process by use of internet technology, life-long learning, funding of construction of intelligent housing, construction agreements, the process of goal-setting, the process of designing, the process of creating an intelligent, favourable residential environment, the process of use and facilities management and others.

Numerous stakeholder groups take part in a building X  X  life cycle, influence its effectiveness and try to achieve their goals (clients and users, designers, contractors and subcontractors, suppliers, the state and its authorised institutions, municipalities, banks, organisations offering commissioning and maintenance services for buildings and the like). Their goals involve the following: a desirable building price along with desirable operating fees, area and height, requirements for a building X  X  architecture, aesthetic properties, level of comfort, functional convenience, proportional layout of premises and sound insulation qualities of its enclosure structures, taxes and their exemptions, interest rates and the like. It is also important whether the residential environment is ecologically clean and noiseless and whether the local infra-structure is good.

The given view to KM in construction projects is generalised by distinguishing four of the most important knowledge management stages  X  project information and knowledge gathering, knowledge acquisition, best practice knowledge data base creation and knowl-edge based decision support for implementing other projects.
Project information and knowledge gathering as well as the knowledge acquisition stages are strongly interconnected with all construction project life cycle activities including conceptual planning, design, procurement, construction, operations and maintenance. It should be noticed that information and knowl-edge must be gathered from all the different bodies and organisations participating in the project, e.g., clients, designers, consultants, contractors and inspectors, because the inter-and intra-discipline communications between these distinct profes-sionals are often problematic. The lack of integration and co-ordination between the industry X  X  distinct professions can be perceived as a major contributory factor to poor project performance ( Faniran et al., 2001 ).

An effective knowledge strategy is required to acquire and manage both explicit and tacit knowledge ( Pathirage et al., 2007 ; Kazi, 2005 ).

Tacit knowledge is personal knowledge about a specific context. Such knowledge is hard to formulate, record or express clearly since it is stored in human brains. Tacit knowledge is mostly based on trial and error relevant to real life situations.
Such knowledge is personal; it is part of individual experience and is shared and exchanged through direct, eye-to-eye contact ( Tiwana, 2000 ). Such knowledge can be transferred directly and efficiently. On the other hand, explicit knowledge is learned and acquired indirectly. The knowledge must be decoded into the individual mental models of each person and then named as explicit knowledge. Such knowledge can be encoded and transferred through a medium of systematic or formal language.
Precise awareness is formal knowledge which can be sorted like information. Such knowledge may be found in organisational documents, including reports, articles, agreements, manuals, patents, drawings, video and audio materials, software and such.
It may also be found in organisational documents such as a company X  X  diagrams, charts, tables, process plans, the wording of a mission and its experience and the like.

The collection and management of explicit knowledge is easier during the construction phase of a project, because information and knowledge is accessible in documents. Document manage-ment can include storage and management of information and knowledge without retrieval of explicit knowledge. Thus it is easier to manage explicit knowledge than tacit knowledge.
However, the main problem behind tacit knowledge is related to its effective translation into structured information and unstructured information. After the tacit knowledge is trans-formed, both the structured and unstructured information can be supervised and managed by using document management tools ( Kazi, 2005 ).

Tserng and Lin (2004) distinguished the main problems indicated in construction phases by acquiring and using tacit and explicit knowledge. According to those au thors, problems regarding tacit knowledge involve losses of experience, know-how, problem  X  solu-tion and innovation. Problems connected with explicit information are mainly connected with informat ion saving issues; information can be recorded incompletely or only in part.

The above mentioned problems can be solved by use of information technology and tacit data coding as well as other technology based measures like videos, interviews and others.
When the knowledge is collected, the next step is the best practice data base creation avoiding insignificant or less worthy information. It should be noticed that construction projects are usually not universal. Therefore the standardisation of all project life cycle phases is needed.
Furthermore the database must be periodically updated for new information and knowledge acquisition.

When the best practice database is created, the second step is knowledge application and reuse in order to make knowledge based decisions in construction projects.

The IKM model, proposed by the authors of this paper, integrates economic, political, legal/regulat ory, technological, technical, orga-nisational, managerial, institutional, social, cultural, ethical, psycho-logical, educational, environmental, emotional and confidence-building needs of stakeholders and both the explicit and tacit knowledge. It covers micro-, meso-and macro-environment conditions as well as a building life cycle analysis. This model can be used for the multivariant design and for the multiple criteria analysis of construction projects. 3. Knowledge based decision support system for construction projects management (KDSS-CPM)
The Knowledge Based Decision Support System for Construc-tion Projects Management (KDSS-CPM) in web page: http://193. 219.145.33/loreta was developed based on the analysis of existing information, expert, intelligent, knowledge management and decision support systems and existing decision making methods ( Adeli, 1988 ; Ginevicius et al., 2008 ; Hajdasz, 2008a, 2008b ) ( Fig. 4 ).

KDSS-CPM consists of a database, database management system, model-base, model-base management system and a user interface.

The KDSS-CPM database management system allows users to analyse the scenarios of construction processes by taking into account the system of criteria.

The analysis of database structures according to the type of problem solved reveals their various utilities. There are three basic types of database structures: hierarchical, network and relational. The KDSS-CPM system has a relational database structure when information is stored in the form of tables. These tables contain quantitative and conceptual information. Each table is given a name and is saved in the computer X  X  external memory as a separate file. Logically linked parts of a table comprise a relational model. The following tables form the KDSS-
CPM database: initial data tables, tables assessing construction project solutions and tables of a multivariant design.
 A module base allows the KDSS-CPM X  X  user to select the most suitable construction alternatives by comparing the measures that promote the greatest value to all interested bodies and organisations.

Since the efficiency of a construction project variant is often determined by taking into account organisational, management, technological, economic, technical, legal, social and other factors, a model-base of a KDSS-CPM should include models enabling a decision maker to perform a comprehensive analysis of the variants available and make a proper choice. The following models of model-base are aimed to perform this function: a model for developing the alternative variants of a construc-tion project, a model for determining the initial weights of the criteria (with the use of expert methods), a model for criteria weight establishment, a model for the multivariant design of a construction project, a model for multiple criteria analysis and setting priorities, a model for determining project utility degree and a model for providing recommendations.
 As example, two models (a model for multiple criteria analysis and setting priorities and a model for determining project utility degree) are described further. A model for multiple criteria analysis and setting priorities performs the multiple criteria analysis of construction project alternatives and sets project priorities based on the weighted criteria and tacit and explicit knowledge. The model for determining the project utility degree sets the utility degree for each analysed project. The Complex Proportional Assessment method (COPRAS) ( Zavadskas and Kaklauskas, 1999 ; Kaklauskas, 1999 ) is used for these purposes.
The results of the comparative analysis of projects are presented as a grouped decision-making matrix where the columns contain n alternative projects, while all the pertinent quantitative and conceptual information is found in Table 2 . Any alternative that has a poorer criterion value than that required is rejected. In order to perform a complete study of a project, a complex evaluation is needed of its economic, qualitative, technical, technological, ecological, climatic and social conditions, traditions and requirements for better customer satisfaction.
Quantitative and conceptual descriptions provide this information. The diversity of aspects being assessed should include a variety of data presented as needed for decision-making. Therefore the necessary conceptual information may be presented in numerical, textual, graphical (schemes, graphs, diagrams and drawings) or equation formats and as audio or videotapes. An analysis should include all  X  the criteria used for conceptual descriptions, their definitions and the reasons for the choice of a criteria system and their values and weights.
Conceptual information about the possible ways of performing a multivariant design is needed to make a more complete and accurate evaluation. Quantitative information is based on criteria systems and subsystems, units of measure, values and initial weights of the project alternatives. Conceptual information is a more flexible and less accurate means for expressing estimates than numbers are.

This method assumes direct and proportional dependence of significance and priority by versions investigated on a system of criteria adequately describing the alternatives and on the values and weights of the criteria. A system of criteria is determined, and experts calculate the values and initial weights of criteria. All this information can be adjusted by interested parties (customers, users, etc.) considering their goal pursuits and existing capabil-ities. Hence the results of the assessment of alternatives fully reflect the initial construction project data that was jointly submitted by experts and interested parties.

The determination of the significance and priority of alter-natives is carried out in 5 stages.

Stage 1: The weighted, normalised decision-making matrix D is formed. The purpose of this stage is to receive dimensionless weighted values from the comparative indexes. When the dimensionless values of the indexes are known, all criteria, originally having different dimensions, can be compared. The following formula is used for this purpose: d  X  where x ij is the value of the i th criterion in the j th alternative of a solution, m the number of criteria; n the number of the alternatives compared and q i the weight of the i th criterion.
The sum of the dimensionless weighted index value d ij for each criterion x i is always equal to the weight q i of this criterion: q  X 
In other words, the value of weight q i of the investigated criterion is proportionally distributed among all alternative versions a j according to their values x ij .

Stage 2: The sums of weighted, normalised indexes describing the j th version are calculated. The versions are described by minimising indexes S j and maximising indexes S + j . The lower value of minimised indexes is better and the greater value of maximised indexes is better. The sums are calculated according to the formula:
S  X 
In this case, the values S + j (the greater this value [project  X  X  X luses X  X  X , the more satisfied are the interested parties) and S (the lower this value [project  X  X  X inuses X  X  X , the better the goal attainment by the interested parties) express the degree of goals attained by the interested parties in each alternative project. In any case, the sums of  X  X  X luses X  X  S + j and  X  X  X inuses X  X  S j alternatives are always, respectively, equal to all sums of the weights of maximised and minimised criteria:
S  X  S  X 
Stage 3: The significance (efficiency) of the compared versions is determined by describing the characteristics of positive alternatives ( X  X  X luses X  X ) and negative alternatives ( X  X  X inuses X  X ).
The relative significance Q j of each alternative a j is found according to the formula:
Q
Stage 4: The priorities of the alternatives are determined. The greater is the Q j the higher is the efficiency (priority) of the construction project alternative.

The analysis of the method presented makes it possible to state that it may be easily applied to evaluating projects and selecting the most efficient of them while being fully aware of the physical meaning of the process. Moreover it allows formulating a reduced criterion Q j which is directly proportional to the relative effect of the compared criteria values x ij and weights q i on the end result.
Significance Q j of project a j indicates the degree of satisfaction of demands and goals pursued by the interested parties  X  the greater is the Q j the higher is the efficiency of the project (see Table 3 ).

Stage 5: The degree of project utility directly associates with its relevant quantitative and conceptual information. If one project is characterised as the best comfort, aesthetics and price indexes, while another is shown with better maintenance and facilities management characteristics, both will have obtained the same significance values as a result of the multiple criteria evaluation; this means their utility degree is also the same. With an increase (decrease) in the significance of the project analysed, the project X  X  degree of utility also increases (decreases). The degree of project utility is determined by comparing the project analysed with the most efficient project. In this case, all the utility degree values related to the project analysed will range from 0% to 100%. This will facilitate a visual assessment of the project X  X  efficiency.
The formula used for calculating alternative aj utility degree N is the following:
N  X  X  Q j : Q max  X  100 %  X  6  X  4. Case study
A client who wants to construct a detached house deals with the following main tasks: he/she selects the best parcel for his/her needs, a suitable design of a detached house and the contractor to be involved in the construction. All these procedures are based both on explicit and tacit knowledge.
 Selection of a parcel using the Knowledge Based Decision Support
System for Construction Projects Management (KDSS-CPM) is analysed as an example. The client can select a parcel from the alternative variants available in the KDSS-CPM database (here 8 alternatives are taken). The datab ase provides a textual description along with visual data of the alternative parcels (see Fig. 5 ).
A quantitative assessment of the parcels (see Fig. 5 ) is shown in Fig. 6 . These parcels are analysed using a set of 13 quantitative and qualitative criteria: price, engineering systems, roads, transportation system, size and such. Each criterion is assigned a measurement unit which is either minimising or maximising a weight and values which describe specific analysed projects. Each analysed alternative has both positive and negative features. As an example, the most expensive parcel (priced at 650,000 LTL, located in Visoriai, Vilnius) is compared with a parcel of average price (250,000 LTL, located in Pavilnys, Vilnius). The most expensive parcel has the following advantages: close to the city, outside parcel, good access, near a forest, available geodetic measurements and electricity, public transport to Vilnius city, large green area in the neighbourhood and a paved road leading directly to the parcel. However, it has disadvantages as well: location within the city where the pollution level is greater than it is in more remote areas, an outdated public transport system and a nearby road with heavy traffic. An ecologically clean residential environment is one of the most important factors when selecting a place to live. Furthermore the underdeveloped infrastructure of the area also negatively impacts the attractiveness of this variant.
The parcel of average price is at a greater distance from the main urban areas; it is located at the outskirts of the Dz  X  iaugsmo residential area on a main street. The parcel is on an elevation with a stunning view of Pavilnys Valley. It is a rather large parcel and, according to the detailed plan, it is located at a distance of 15 m from the main street of the area. The parcel is close to
Pavilniai Reserve (100 m away). Gas and electricity are available; geodetic measurements were performed. However, this parcel also has disadvantages. Although the parcel is within the territory of Vilnius, it is part of an area of gardening plots. It does not have urban engineering networks, and this fact has a negative impact on the parcel X  X  market value. The uneven surface of the parcel impedes construction work. A typically designed house would hardly fit there; thus the design will cost more than usual. It will be difficult to continue construction during off-seasons (autumn, winter). The parcel is close to the main street of the area; thus dust and noise caused by traffic makes this parcel less attractive for residential construction.

Upon completion of the quantitative assessment of the alternatives, the elements of construction project management are analysed using the multiple criteria analysis. This particular example deals with the assessment of multiple criteria of the alternative parcels. Calculations reveal the best variant with a utility degree of 100%, i.e., Variant 7. Variant 2 at 98.47% takes second place in the utility degree line and the rest follow. This way the priorities of alternative parcels are determined. The worst variant will have the lowest utility degree; it is Variant 4 at 91.71%, in this particular case (see Fig. 7 ).

Thesystem X  X multiplecriteriam odel for measuring the utility degree and market value shows what price of an evaluated alternative would make it equally competitive in the market after a complex assessment of all the advantages and disadvantages of the analysed alternatives. For instance, at current market prices, if Variant 8 would cost 265,252 LTL instead of 649,999 LTL, it would become competitive in the market when compared to the most attractive variant: its utility degree would comprise 99. 12% instead of 94.17%, and it would take second instead of seventh place in the priority queue (see Fig. 8 ).
In the same manner, the multiple criteria analysis is applied to other components for construction project management. By using the collected information as basis, it is possible to perform a multiple criteria analysis of the construction project X  X  compo-nents (parcel selection, house project selection, contractors X  selection, etc.) and select the most efficient versions.
The presented system, which is based on both explicit and tacit knowledge, can generate up to 100,000 alternative versions of construction projects, perform their multiple criteria analyses, determine the utility degree and market value and select the most beneficial alternative without human interference ( Fig. 9 ).

After this, the received compatible and rational components of a construction project are joined into the systemised projects.
Having performed a multiple criteria analysis of the projects in this way, the most efficient construction projects can be selected.
For example, multivariant designing helped to determine that the client should select Parcel 7, House Design 5 and UAB Vilsta Company as the contractor (see Fig. 10 ).

The proposed KDSS-CPM system can provide advantages such as the ability to: save, use and transfer the best experience regarding construc-tion projects, derive efficient and environmentally friendly construction solutions, flexibly adapt to a changing construction environment, reduce construction costs and encourage construction throughout the entire building life cycle.

The following processes are automated: multi-criteria analysis of variant combinations, determination of utility degree and priorities and selection of the most efficient variants. Moreover the strengths and weaknesses of the analysed variants are presented; i.e., it is possible to see why and to what extent one alternative is better than is another.

The system helps to formulate recommendations. Fig. 9 explains in detail how the value is affected quantitatively by parcel valuation criteria expressed through explicit and tacit knowledge. The matrix informs how to make parcels more attractive to stakeholders interested in a construction project. Many parcels offered for sale are located in areas of gardening plots. The fact that today gardening areas are becoming residential areas of cities is an urgent issue in Lithuania. These garden plot areas are not yet considered residential; thus persons who choose their garden plots for permanent residence have numerous infrastructure-related problems: water supply, sewage management, roads, electricity supply and other necessities of daily life.

As an example, an analysis follows regarding the attractiveness to the client of Variant 7, which is located in a gardening area (see Figs. 11 and 12 , Variant 7).

Calculations have shown that price is the most significant criterion making this parcel more attractive. From a client X  X  perspective, a lower market price makes an alternative more attractive (the price criterion must be minimised). However, the values of the parcels can increase by correcting some of the determining factors.
 The system recommends the following:
Infrastructure and engineering systems considerably impact the value of the parcels. Variant 7 can serve as an example (see Fig. 12 ):
This parcel is in a gardening area, and its engineering systems are not part of urban systems; thus the area is underdeveloped.
If urban engineering networks and gas were available, the parcel X  X  market value would increase by 23%.

Legal regulations (legal basis) applicable to these parcels are taken as another example ( Fig. 12 ):
Calculations show that the legal regulations for activities can be improved by about 43%.

Should the legal regulations for activities in this parcel improve by 43%, the market value would increase by 2%.
Improved legislation and permission to change the land purpose would help to change the status of gardening areas into residential areas; thus the market value of such parcels would increase, and this parcel would become more attractive.

Next a look is taken at how the existing environment of a specific area impacts a parcel X  X  attractiveness ( Figs. 11 and 12 ):
Experts assigned 6 points (one of the worst scores among the alternatives) to the attractiveness of the neighbourhood of Parcel 6 (Alternative 6, see Figs. 11 and 12 ).

Calculations show that should the environment improve by 50%, the parcel X  X  attractiveness would increase by 2%.
Lastly a look is taken at how the size of a parcel affects its attractiveness: The size of Variant 7 is 15 ares.

Calculations show that an increase of 33% in size would make the parcel more attractive by 2%.

Such examples prove that the system X  X  recommendations are significant both to buyers (help to select the best alternatives based on explicit and tacit knowledge) and sellers (help to determine which features should be improved to make their offers more attractive). 5. Conclusion remarks
The authors of this article started publishing their research articles on knowledge management in 2004 ( Kaklauskas et al., 2004 ; Kaklauskas and Kanapeckiene, 2005 ). The articles described knowledge bases and knowledge systems of real estate valuation, building refurbishment, innovations and best construction prac-tice developed by the authors ( Kaklauskas and Zavadskas, 2007a, 2009 , Kaklauskas et al., 2007b , Zavadskas et al., 2006, 2008a, 2008b ). The original contribution of this article, compared to the research results published earlier, is as follows:
The new original Knowledge Based Decision Support System for Construction Projects Management (KDSS-CPM) has been developed.

KDSS-CPM generates recommendations in an automated manner, i.e., it is a recommender system to some extent.
KDSS-CPM is able to develop tens of thousands of alternative variants for project management and to select the most rational of them in an automated manner.

The Integrated Knowledge Management Model, proposed by the authors herein, considers the economical, political, legal/ regulatory, technological, technical, organisational, manage-rial, institutional, social, cultural, ethical, psychological, educa-tional, environmental, emotional and confidence needs of stakeholders in terms of both explicit and tacit knowledge and covers micro-, meso-and macro-environmental conditions as well as a building life cycle analysis.

As developed by the authors, the KDSS-CPM can be used to perform the multivariant design and multiple criteria analysis for the management of construction projects. Using the accumulated information and the models, the Knowledge Based Decision Support System for Construction Projects
Management can automatically generate up to 100,000 combinations of construction project alternatives. Further-more the system provides decision support and forms recommendations significant to all the stakeholders partici-pating in a project by helping to select the best alternatives and improve their characteristics based on tacit and explicit knowledge.
