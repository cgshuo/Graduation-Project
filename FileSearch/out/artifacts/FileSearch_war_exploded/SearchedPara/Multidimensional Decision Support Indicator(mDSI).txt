 Massive amount of financial time series data encourages investors to find new technical devices to understand a stock X  X  behavior. Methods such as support vector machines and neural networks pro vide excellent support for time series data mining, particularly forecasting and predicting trends in stocks, [1,2,3], etc. On the other hand, technical analysis promotes a wide variety of indicators to predict the start of the trends (or derivat ives) of prices or volumes over time. For example, an indicator, the relative strength index (RSI) tracks the trends and signals by weighing the difference between gains and losses for n days; another indicator the momentum tags similar trends with tracking price changes over n days; the moving averages (MA) use mean to see these trends; Stochastics (ST), covers same trends by adjusting its momentums; the price rate of changes (ROC) understands these with measuring the price changes; etc. However, basically these indicators use time series data points to detect the trends or shifts in supply and demand, particularly identifying regions of interests such as overbought and oversold and market conditions, namely bullish and bearish [4,5,6,7,8,9,10] are of the interests. Overbought (or oversold) is a condition in which a stock or market has recently experienced a sharp rise (or f all) in price and is vulnerable to a price drop (or rise), because few buyers (or sellers) are left to drive the price up (or down) any farther. Similarly, bullish (or bearish) signal is used to describe an optimistic (or pessimistic) sentiment to ward an issue, an index, or the market in general; a bullish (or bearish) sentiment reflects a belief that prices will tend to rise (or fall).

Though these indicators seem to predic t the trends with mo re accuracies, often they disagree in their predictions. This is due to the fact that they use different features like moving averages u se means, momentums use dispersions, etc in their predictions. Choosing a best indicator or indicators is expensive and challenging. Rather, in this work, we propose a generalized approach for predicting trends in a time series data in which a univariate time series data is transformed into multidimensional time series data where it is processed with multiple data mining procedures. In the end, it suggests a multidimensional decision support indicator ( mDSI ) to use on any time series data for learning the trends. In general, the mDSI integrates multiple decision criteria into a single time series index value to plot on a chart beside the price or volume in stock analysis. Experiments on the real data confirm its performance.
Rest of this paper is organized int o 5 sections. Section 2 introduces the methodology while section 3 discusses e xperimental work. Section 4 justifies and compares the proposed methodology. Section 5 concludes the work. In this section we formally introduce our proposed multidimensional decision support indicator in the presence of multiple features. This indicator is obtained using multiple sequential data mining steps as illustrated in Fig.1. The definitions for these steps are summarized in the following sections: 2.1 Features and Decision Functions Let x be a time series data point at time t ,wedenoteas x t , then this point can be represented as a function of time series points as shown below: Afeature f i in this work is defined as an individual measurable heuristic property of the phenomena being observed over a period of time and we can write this as: Also a function of time series data points, features or a feature itself can be identified with an technical indicator in stocks. Suppose  X  t is an indicator of price action in stocks at time t , then the  X  t can be written as: where k is the number of features. Moreover , we define a decision criteria in this paper as q mutually exclusive decisions or conclusions as shown below: where  X  and  X  are decision values and decision th reshold levels, respectively. If f 1 and f 2 are n 1 days X  moving average and standard deviation, then a possible deci-sion criteria, say  X  t 12 , with two mutually exclusive decisions can be designed as: With k features, m decision criteria can be formed ( m  X  k ) and each decision criteria can be considered, without any loss of generality, as a dimension in m-dimensional space at any given time t . That is, a matrix of multiples of  X  and m as its rows and columns could be constructed. And each row in this sample space can assume to follow an arbitrary cluster. Let  X  be a function such that: with  X  clusters (or classes). Let  X  be a weight vector of m decision criteria, index function,  X  t ,as,  X  t =  X  (  X ,  X  ) 2.2 Estimating Weights Since the above equation has two unknowns, in this section we propose an infor-mation gain based weight evaluation. The information gain of two random vari-ables is a quantity that measures the mutual dependence of the two variables. Intuitively, mutual information measures the information about one variable that is shared by another variable. Using this analogy, this work proposes a method-ology to compute the weights through unsupervised learning. As a precursor, a clustering technique is suggested to learn the patterns from the processed multi-dimensional time series data. Later, a classification is recommended to verify and identify the corresponding weights through gaining the information. Repeated process of this further encouraged to ensure that any feature is not missed out. Let  X  be an information gain parameter, then we write the gain between any  X  and  X  as: probabilities of  X  j and  X  respectively. Then the resultant gain becomes a weight of decision criteria j ,thatis,  X  j =  X  (  X  j , X  ) An optimum  X  could be further ob-tained using the following equation: where  X  j X  is a value of  X  j obtained from cluster  X  . Alternatively,  X  can be com-puted by choosing a best cluster from the list, that is,  X  =  X  where  X  is a weight the misclassification rate of classes. 2.3 Our Multidimensional Decision Support Indicator Without any loss of generality,  X  t can be closely approximated as: with  X  tj as a decision value at time t and  X  j as a weight of j th decision criteria. Then I t , the decision support indicator, could be deduced from Eqn.1 as I t =  X  (  X  t ) [11] and it can be written as: of interests such as overbought signal line, U t and oversold signal line, L t could easily be derived using statistical control limits for a specified risk as: where  X  and  X  are the statistical mean and standard deviation of I and s ,a scalar quantity which measures distance from the mean. Experiments conducted with about forty features to study the effects such as short term and long term trends, and distributions of price movements. The weights of each decision criteria are estimated, from a historical data of Dow Jones industrial average [12] and Nasdaq [13] indices, and [14] using Eqn.9, for various clusters. A sample of these weights are presented in Table 1 for two groups in which group one has two clusters and group two has three clusters. With these weights, the mDSI index values are computed for every period and the results are plotted on the chart as shown in Fig.2 for DJIA index values. The arbitrary limits for overbought and oversold are taken as . 8and . 2atparwith RSI . The charts display many times the bullish and bearish signals by staying on top for a while as well as in the bottom. Similarly, the charts exhibit buying and selling opportunities by crossing the limits. Further examination on mDSI is done for its sensitivity to sudden changes or noises in prices. Fig.3 highlights these scenario at two occasions, one with positive changes and another one with negative changes. In both cases, the mDSI is quickly reacting to these changes. To see its effectiveness when compared to i ts competitors, its cumulative dis-tribution, correlation and cost are taken into the account. A sample stock of CREAF is examined on mDSI , RSI , Stochastics, moving average convergence and divergence (MACD) and MA indicators. The observed trends are plotted in Fig.4. Chart 4(a) highlights trends captured by the different indicators and the graph 4(b) shows their cumulative distributions. In both cases, the mDSI shows its close correlation with its competitors. This is again confirmed in Fig.5 while specifically comparing with RSI indicator. The cost comparison is done with RSI and mDSI charts, for example. With different threshold levels for oversold and overbought, an investment of one unit X  X  growth rate has been tested and its results are presented in Table 2. This table evidences mDSI  X  X  good perfor-mance at every threshold levels and also at extreme levels over the RSI index. For example, for an investment of $1000 in IBM , the investor gains about $620 when he uses mDSI and $230 when he uses RSI for a four year period. For both indexes, oversold and overbought regions set at 0 . 9and0 . 1, respectively. However, for better yields, the regions need to be adjusted with optimized limits. This work suggests a general framework for modeling multiple decisions using a utility function and information gain. Methodologies such as classification and clustering are effectively used to calculate the weights of each decision criteria. In particular, a multidimensional decision support indicator ( mDSI ) for predicting stock trends has been proposed. This indicator function monitors stock trends closely and indicates the outliers such as overbought and oversold regions along with other market conditions. The robustness of the indicator has been tested with real data and observed sufficient evi dences for better performance over its competitors. Its preliminary experimen t on cost also shows better performance than its immediate competitor such as RSI. Further work is initiated to improve the mDSI and also with price and volumes. This can effectively be used for any time series data.
