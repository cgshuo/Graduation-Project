 Abstract In this paper, we present first results from annotating abstract (dis-course-deictic) anaphora in German. Our annotation guidelines provide linguistic tests for identifying the antecedent, and for determining the semantic types of both the antecedent and the anaphor. The corpus consists of selected speaker turns from the Europarl corpus. To date, 100 texts have been annotated according to these guidelines. The annotations show that anaphoric personal and demonstrative pro-nouns differ with respect to the distance to their antecedents. A semantic analysis reveals that, contrary to suggestions put forward in the literature, referents of anaphors do not tend to be more abstract than the referents of their antecedents. Keywords Abstract anaphora Abstract entities Coreference annotation Semantic annotation 1 Introduction An important component in understanding text is anaphora resolution , i.e., determining the reference of constituents whose interpretation depends on (the reference of) other textual elements. The majority of anaphora are instances of noun phrase anaphora ( NP anaphora ), which relate an anaphor to a nominal (NP) antecedent. Prevalent examples of anaphors are personal and demonstrative pronouns. The resolution process of such pronominal anaphors is guided by grammatical restrictions (gender, number agreement) and saliency (grammatical function, recency). In addition to pronouns, definite noun phrases can be viewed as anaphoric in that they may corefer with some other NP in the given text. To resolve the latter type of anaphora, or coreferencing of proper nouns, simple pattern matching methods on the head nouns can be applied, or lexical semantic knowledge can be exploited, such as that provided by an ontology or a database like WordNet Fellbaum ( 1998 ) (cf. Ng ( 2010 ) for a recent survey).

Another type of anaphora is discourse deixis (Webber 1988 , 1991 ), which relates an anaphor to a verbal or (multi-)clausal antecedent. The discourse entities that are referenced by antecedents of discourse deictic anaphors are called abstract objects since they refer to propositional entities, such as events or facts (Asher 1993 ). Grammatical restrictions cannot apply to them because the antecedent is non-nominal.

We assume that, in addition to saliency, the resolution process needs to take semantic restrictions into account, which are imposed by properties of the antecedent as well as the context of the anaphor. For instance, in Ex. 1a, the clause penguins migrate to Fiji denotes an event, and the anaphor it takes up the event while adding further specifications, namely that the migration event happens before another event, the hatching event. However, as shown, e.g., by Byron ( 2002 ) and Webber ( 1988 ), abstract anaphors can take up abstract objects in different ways .In Ex. 1b, the anaphor that does not refer to the migration event itself but to the fact that this event takes place each fall.
 Example 1 ( from Byron 2002 ) a. Each fall, penguins migrate to Fiji. It happens just before the eggs hatch. b. Each fall, penguins migrate to Fiji. That  X  X  why I X  X  going there next month.
In this paper, we use the terms abstract anaphor/antecedent for anaphors or antecedents that refer to abstract objects. The semantic type of an antecedent relates to semantic properties of the referent, as introduced in its original context (e.g., the anaphor relates to the way the anaphor is used to characterize the propositional discourse referent denoted by its antecedent (e.g., the semantic type of that in Ex. 1b is  X  X  X act X  X ). We report results from an annotation experiment comprising the following steps: (1) identifying the abstract antecedent; (2) determining the semantic type of the antecedent and (3) of the anaphor. We exclusively rely on annotation guidelines. 2 Related work Corpus-based studies have shown that abstract objects are less salient than other discourse referents, which effects the choice of the anaphoric element (Hegarty et al. 2001 ). Whereas, in English, anaphors referring to abstract entities are predominantly realized by demonstrative pronouns (Gundel et al. 2004 ; Webber 1988 ), the situation is different for other languages, e.g., Spanish and Catalan (Recasens 2008a ), or Danish and Italian (Navarretta and Olsen 2008 ).
The semantic type of the antecedent (e.g., event, fact ) and that of the anaphor do not necessarily coincide (cf. Ex. 1b). The data suggests that reference to other types (referred to in the literature as coercion ) is possible only in accordance with an abstractness hierarchy (Consten and Knees 2005 ; Consten et al. 2007 ; Hegarty et al. 2001 ). The hierarchy starts with events being defined as the most concrete type, which are anchored in spatial-temporal dimensions, and ends with propositions as the most abstract types, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (Asher 1993 ). The Abstractness Hypothesis states that anaphoric reference is possible to antecedents that are of the same type as the anaphor, or are of a less abstract type than the anaphor (Consten and Knees 2005 ; Hegarty et al. 2001 ).

Compared to work on NP anaphora, considerably less corpus-based research has been devoted to abstract anaphora. Table 1 presents a survey of studies involving abstract anaphora. In the table, we classify annotation research efforts on discourse deixis on the basis of formal and semantic criteria which we consider crucial for the task of resolving abstract anaphora.

As can be seen from Table 1 , most corpus-based works on anaphora resolution do not annotate semantic types. Notable exceptions are Botley ( 2006 ), Hedberg et al. ( 2007 ), Navarretta and Olsen ( 2008 ), Dipper and Zinsmeister ( 2009 ), who distinguish between semantic types such as events, processes, states (eventualities) and facts, propositions (factualities). Recasens and Mart X   X  ( 2009 ) use a different classification; they define the types token, type, proposition . Poesio and Artstein ( 2008 ) annotate selected semantic properties such as person, animate, concrete, space, time , etc. Byron ( 2003 ) and Eckert and Strube ( 2000 ) do not annotate semantic-type information but incorporate corresponding semantic constraints in their resolution algorithms. Only two projects also annotate semantic information of the antecedent: Hedberg et al. ( 2007 ), who annotate cognitive status, and our own project, in which semantic types are annotated (Dipper and Zinsmeister 2009 ).
This paper focuses on criteria and linguistic tests for the annotation of anaphors and antecedents and their semantic types . We define different paraphrase tests that aid annotators in annotating formal and semantic properties. 3 The corpus Our corpus consists of texts from the Europarl corpus (Koehn 2005 ). The Europarl corpus consists of verbatim reports of debates in the European Parliament, both in the original language, as delivered by the speaker, as well as in translations into 10 other languages, as delivered by the translation services of the European Union. In the Europarl corpus, individual contributions ( X  X  X urns X  X ) are marked by SGML elements, along with the names, parties and languages of the respective speakers. As our basis, we selected all contributions whose original language is German (including Austrian German).

For the annotation task, we isolated medium-sized turns, consisting of 15 X 20 sentences. This choice was made to guarantee that the turns were not too lengthy but still provided enough information for the annotators to understand the broader context of the discussion, allowing them to resolve the anaphors without comprehension problems.

Note that these turns do not stem from interactive dialogues. Instead, they consist of complete individual contributions to heavily regulated parliamentary debates. Hence, they are usually self-contained and tend not to include references to previous utterances in the form of anaphoric pronouns. 4 The guidelines Our guidelines are based on theoretical research on discourse semantics as well as on work concerning the annotation of discourse phenomena. We follow Consten and Knees ( 2005 ) and Hegarty et al. ( 2001 ) in assuming that the semantic type of the antecedent and anaphor are relevant for the resolution process.

Our investigations are currently restricted to abstract anaphors in the form of das, dies  X  X hat, this X  (demonstrative pronouns) and es  X  X t X  (personal pronoun). The guidelines define (1) how to identify abstract anaphora, (2) how to identify the antecedent, (3) how to determine the semantic type of the antecedent, and (4) how to determine the semantic type of the anaphor. For each of these tasks, the guidelines provide linguistic tests (Dipper and Zinsmeister 2009 ). 4.1 Pronoun check: identifying abstract anaphora The first task is to determine whether the pronoun refers to an abstract entity. That is, annotators are asked to exclude expletives, or pronouns referring to nominal antecedents, or pronouns whose referent is salient in the context without being mentioned explicitly in the text (e.g., an action plan under discussion in a debate). 4.2 Namely Test : identifying the antecedent To determine the scope of the anaphoric relation, i.e., its antecedent, the Namely Test is applied: The annotator supplements the anaphor by a paraphrase in the form of na  X  mlich X  X  X amely X X . The placeholder X corresponds to the sought antecedent in the text.

The following example illustrates the application of the Namely Test. The antecedent as determined by the test is underlined; both the anaphor and its antecedent are labelled by their semantic types (cf. Sects. 4.3 and 4.4 ). The last item shows the results from the Namely Test: the anaphor is followed by the inserted test paraphrase (in italics).
 Example 2 German :
Die Zusammenfu  X  hrung der nationalen und europa  X  ischen Ebene ist sehr wohl notwendig, obwohl natu  X  rlich die Hauptta  X  tigkeit in den Mitgliedstaaten stattfinden sollte und nur dann [ auf europa  X  ischer Ebene eingegriffen werden] neg sollte, wenn English :
It is indeed necessary to bring the national and European levels together, even though, of course, the main work should be done in the Member States, with the European level intervening only when this is absolutely necessary.
 Namely Test :
Antecedents consist of VPs, (discontinuous fragments of) main or subordinate clauses, or multiple sentences. For instance, the anaphor dies alles  X  X ll this X  often refers to an antecedent consisting of multiple sentences. In some cases, the antecedent is an abstract NP, usually involving a deverbal noun, such as diese Einschra  X  nkung  X  X his limitation X , as in the following example.
 Example 3 German : Zweitens geht es in diesem Kontext um [ die Einschr  X  ankung gewerkschaftlicher Rechte von Polizisten  X  deverb .Auch[ dies ] deverb ist nicht hinnehmbar.
 English :
Secondly, there is also, in this context, the issue of the limitation of police officers trade union rights. This is not acceptable either.
 Namely test :
When formulating the paraphrase, annotators are asked to adhere as closely as possible to the original text. Nevertheless, the actual antecedent can diverge from the one constructed by the Namely Test in minor aspects. Minor aspects are differences that only involve inflectional endings or functional words, i.e., non-lexical material. Examples of such variations are active-passive-alternations or bare infinitive versus zu -infinitive versus participle.

In some cases, the divergences are more fundamental and could, for instance, involve inserting or modifying the main verb. In such cases, annotators are asked to record the differences. For instance, in the following example, they would record that their choice of a main verb, herstellen  X  X stablish X  or pflegen  X  X aintain X , differs from the main verb in the given text ( brauchen  X  X eed X ). Example 4 German :
Es geht nicht darum, in Einflussspha  X  ren zu denken, dies ist nicht gegen Russland gerichtet, denn auch [ eine demokratische Ukraine wird gute Beziehungen zu Russland brauchen  X  circ , und [ das ] prop sollten wir als Europa  X  er unterstu  X  tzen. English :
This is not about thinking in terms of spheres of influence, nor is it anti-Russian, for a democratic Ukraine too will need good relations with Russia, and we Europeans need to support it in this .
 Namely test : ... das  X  na  X  mlich dass eine demokratische Ukraine gute Beziehungen zu Russ-land herstellt/pflegt  X   X  ... this  X  namely that a democratic Ukraine too will need to establish/maintain good relations with Russia  X  X 
Anaphors that precede their antecedents (= cataphors) or are intraposed X  X sually embedded in parantheses X  X lso occur, as illustrated by the next example.
 Example 5 German : auch sehr deutlich gemacht  X  [ im Falle, dass unsere Gesetzgebungskompetenz beschnitten wird, klar und deutlich dagegen vorgehen] circ .
 English : be firm in taking action to deal with any threat to curtail our legislative competence. 4.3 NP-Replacement Test : the semantic type of the anaphor Once the antecedent is localized, the next step is to determine the semantic type of the anaphor. For this task, we defined the NP-Replacement Test . With this test, the anaphors dies, das, es are replaced by suitable NPs with prototypical head nouns, such as dieses Ereignis, diese Tatsache, diese Ansicht  X  X his event, this fact, this opinion X . We use the head noun as an indicator of the semantic type of the propositional entity (e.g., event, fact). See Table 2 for the classes of replacement nouns that we distinguish between.

Annotators are presented with a list of nouns from which they may choose. They may also add new nouns if necessary; however, our current list turned out to be adequate for most cases. The NP-Replacement Test is divided into two parts: First, annotators are asked to pick the first noun that comes to their mind which fits the context well. Second, they can select (or add) further well-fitting nouns. Suitable determiners have to be picked along with the nouns, e.g. diese, eine solche, diese Art von  X  X his, such a, this kind of X .
 In Ex. 5, a suitable NP would be dieser Umstand  X  X his circumstance X . Accordingly, the anaphor is labelled as  X  X irc X  (cf. Table 2 ).
 Example 6 Namely Test: (applied to Ex. 5)
We consider the determiners  X  X his kind of X  (Ex. 2) and  X  X uch a X  (Ex. 4) as indicative of the semantic type  X  X rop(osition) X , since they are used to abstract away from concrete instances of events, situations, etc. Replacement NPs and their semantic types for the remaining examples are shown below. Example 2 is annotated twice, and, furthermore, the noun Ma X nahme  X  X easure X  is assigned two semantic types; it can denote an event or a process.  X  Ex. 2: diese Art von Aktion ,  X  X his kind of action X , and diese Ma X nahme  X  X his  X  Ex. 3: diese Einschra  X  nkung  X  X his limitation X ; type  X  X everb X .  X  Ex. 4: eine solche Entwicklung  X  X uch a development X ; type  X  X rop X . 4.4 Colon Test : the semantic type of the antecedent The last annotation step is to determine the semantic type of the antecedent. The annotators are instructed to read the immediate context before the sentence containing the antecedent. Next, they are asked to express the speaker X  X  view towards the antecedent X  X  content. For instance: Is it a fact that the speaker reports? Is it a goal that s/he wants to be pursued? Is it a problem that s/he wants to point out? To express the speaker X  X  view, the annotators formulate an introductory phrase that expresses this view and ends with a colon, followed by the antecedent (hence, the Colon Test).

The annotators are provided with a list of phrase patterns they can select from, such as I state the following needs . The object NPs in these phrases are selected from the same list already used in the NP-Replacement Test . Example verb patterns are shown in Table 3 .

Applied to Ex. 5, a potential introductory phrase could be Ich weise auf den folgenden Umstand hin  X  X  point to the following circumstance X .
 Example 7 Colon Test : (applied to Ex. 5).
 German : Ich weise auf den folgenden Umstand hin: Wir werden im Falle, dass unsere Gesetzgebungskompetenz beschnitten wird, klar und deutlich dagegen vorgehen. English :
I point to the following circumstance: We must be firm in taking action to deal with any threat to curtail our legislative competence.

The semantic type of the antecedent is determined as follows: If the main verb is a  X  X  X eutral X  X  verb, such as  X  X oint to, state X , we use the object NP as an indicator of the semantic type (as in the NP Replacement Test). Hence, the antecedent in Ex. 7 is labeled as  X  X irc X . That is, in this example, the semantic types of the anaphor and its antecedent coincide.

Some verbs contribute relevant meaning, such as  X  X dvocate X . In these cases, it is the verb that determines the semantic type of the antecedent.

Introductory phrases and their semantic types for the remaining examples are shown below. The type combinations of antecedent X  X naphor that occur in these examples are then: neg X  X rop or neg X  X v/proc (Ex. 2), deverb X  X everb (Ex. 3), circ X  prop (Ex. 4), and circ X  X irc (Ex. 5). That is, in all examples (except for the ambiguous case neg X  X v/proc), the Abstractness Hypothesis (cf. Sect. 2 ) is indeed valid.
  X  Ex. 2: Ich lehne folgende Mo  X  glichkeit ab: Es wird auf europa  X  ischer Ebene  X  Ex. 3: die Einschra  X  nkung ...  X  X he limitation X ; type  X  X everbal X  (no introductory  X  Ex. 4: Ich weise auf folgenden Umstand hin:  X  X  point to the following 5 Results 5.1 Rationale of the annotation procedure The idea underlying our annotation method is reliance entirely on linguistic tests. For antecedents, this test consists of a  X  X  X ontainer test X  X  in the sense of Vendler: we create a suitable context (the container) which allows us to embed the antecedent. The context serves as a diagnostic for the semantic type. That is, rather than examining properties of the antecedent directly, we design an annotation procedure that makes explicit the way the speakers conceptualize the entity denoted by the antecedent. 1
In a similar way, the NP-Replacement test also serves to make the speaker X  X  view on the antecedent X  X  content explicit, by replacing  X  X  X eutral X  X  pronouns ( dies  X  X his X ) with more specific NPs, such as diese Tatsache, diese Ansicht  X  X his fact, this opinion X .

However, it is important to distinguish between both acts of reference. The speakers can, of course, refer to and conceptualize one and the same event or situation etc. in different ways. As a consequence, anaphors and their antecedents can differ with regard to their semantic type (Consten and Knees 2005 ; Hegarty et al. 2001 ). Hence, annotators of antecedents must not be influenced by prior anaphor-related annotations. Accordingly, the annotators carrying out the Colon Test are presented the plain text, with the antecedent underlined, but without any information related to the anaphor.

To operationalize the Abstractness Hypothesis, we map the semantic types to scores (similar to the approach by Lappin and Leass 2004 ). We use two different scales: (1) Our scale is directly derived from, and is a rather natural consequence of, the list of prototypical head nouns (combined with article and verb information), which are mapped to the semantic classes defined by us. (2) A scale based on Asher X  X  abstract entity classes which results from mapping our head nouns to Asher X  X  classes. Some of the nouns cannot be easily mapped to Asher X  X  scale (e.g. deverbals), and have to be left out from this scale. Further research is needed, however, to confirm our mapping from nouns to semantic classes. 5.2 Corpus statistics Our current corpus consists of 100 texts (turns) from the Europarl corpus. Two annotators annotated the texts independently from each other using the tool MMAX2. 2 Annotating a complete turn with all four tests takes between 5 and 10 min/annotator, excluding adjudicating the double-annotated texts into a gold standard. 5.2.1 Pronoun usages In total, the texts contain 643 instances of anaphor candidates. Among them, 225 (35%) are abstract anaphors; plus 4 (&lt;1%)  X  X  X eictic anaphors X  X  without an explicit antecedent in the text. Figure 2 displays frequency information about the usages of pronouns. 3 In the remaining section, we focus on analyses of abstract anaphors. 5.2.2 Antecedents Mean length of the antecedents is 13.9 tokens; standard variation is 10.6. This varies considerably among the different types of pronouns: The shortest antecedents occur with es  X  X t X :  X  7.9  X  5.2; the value for das  X  X hat X  is  X 15.4  X  11.6, for dies  X  X his X  5.2.3 Syntactic distance Figure 3 displays interesting differences between the three types of anaphors with  X  X  X yntactic distance X  X , measured in the number of intervening tokens: demonstrative das , which is the most frequent abstract anaphor (with more than 100 instances), occurs most frequently in close adjacency to its antecedent. At the other extreme, pronominal es often occurs in front of its antecedent (cataphoric use). This is indicated by negative distance values. A distance of 0 indicates that the anaphor is intraposed within the antecedent, usually embedded in a parenthesis (see Ex. 5). Finally, demonstrative dies tend to occur with larger distance to its antecedent than das . 6 5.2.4 Semantic distance 7 The bottom plots of Fig. 3 display  X  X  X emantic distance X  X , which compares the semantic types of antecedents and anaphors by computing the  X  X  X istance X  X  on a given abstractness scale. The plot on the left is based on the scale that we established. This scale starts with the highest score for the most concrete entities: eventualities are scored with 4, facts with 3, down to propositions as the most abstract entities, which are scored with 1 (see Table 2 ). The plot on the right is based on Asher X  X  abstractness hierarchy. The scale again assigns the highest score to the most concrete entities.

The anaphor and its antecedent are first scored separately. The final score is the result of subtracting the anaphor X  X  score from the antecedent X  X  score. 8 A score of 0 means that the anaphor and its antecedent are of the same semantic type. Positive scores mean that the anaphor is of a more abstract type than its antecedent. That is, a score of 0 or more means that the Abstractness Hypothesis from Consten and Knees ( 2005 ) and Hegarty et al. ( 2001 ) holds true.

The plots show that our data does not confirm the hypothesis. We do not find the large majority of the data to lie on the positive side (including 0). Instead, the plots resemble a normal distribution. Most often, the anaphor and its antecedent are of the same semantic type; the remaining cases are distributed more or less equally on both the negative and positive sides. The shape of the Asher-based plot is more irregular, and the first quartile equals the median. Still, however, a considerable amount of cases lie on the negative side of the plot, thus contradicting the Abstractness Hypothesis. An example is given in Ex. 8. The antecedent is of type  X  X eg X  (score 1; test phrase: I imagine the following problem ), and the anaphor is of type  X  X v/proc X  (score 4; test phrase: this event ).
 Example 8 German : Wir, die Vertreter der Bu  X  rger, der Menschen Europas, erreichen innerhalb der
Institutionen etwas, und [ wir debattieren daru  X  ber kurz vor Mitternacht und werden ermahnt, wir sollen uns kurz fassen] neg(1) . Das ev / proc (4) ist ein Wiederholungsfall.
 English : Within the institutions, we X  X he representatives of the citizens, of the people of
Europe X  X re actually achieving something, and, as we debate it shortly before midnight, we are enjoined to keep things brief. This is not the first time this has happened. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we presented a corpus-driven approach to abstract anaphora in German. We introduced annotation guidelines that provide linguistic tests for identifying the antecedent, and for determining the semantic types of both the antecedent and the anaphor.

Our analysis of  X  X  X yntactic distance X  X  reveals clear differences between the demonstrative pronouns dies, das and the personal pronoun es : es is often used cataphorically, whereas dies, das usually follow their antecedents. In analyzing  X  X  X emantic distance X  X , our data does not confirm the hypothesis that anaphors are of the same type as their antecedents or more abstract. However, semantic types can be helpful for resolving abstract anaphora since in most cases antecedents and anaphors agree in their types.

As next steps, we will exploit automatic ways of determining semantic types of anaphors. To generate training data automatically, we plan to take into account anaphors of the form dieses Ereignis, dieser Umstand , etc. ( X  X his event, this circumstance X ), which explicitly name the semantic type of the anaphor. In a later step other, more ambiguous, types of anaphors will be included in the investigation. Further work will also include exploitation of contextual information in combina-tion with the semantic types to confine the set of potential antecedents.

The annotations will eventually be applied in an automatic procedure that can be envisaged as follows: Given some text, we first identify abstract anaphors. Next, the semantic type of each anaphor is determined, based on contextual features derived from annotated corpus data. The anaphor X  X  semantic type restricts the semantic type of the antecedent, and thus narrows the search space. Finally, the antecedent is identified with the help of these semantic restrictions and, again, with contextual features derived from the corpus.

Even if abstract anaphora are not able to be reliably resolved in the near future, their identification would be an important preprocessing step in a general coreference resolution system. Performance would be improved if abstract anaphors were not assigned incorrectly to an NP antecedent.
