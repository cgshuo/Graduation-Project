 Discovering Knowledge in Data, an Introduction to Data Mining. By Daniel T. Larose, Ph.D., John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., December 2004, 222 pages. Price $69.95, ISBN 0471666572
Data Mining is a new area mathematics that combines knowledge and techniques from such diverse fields as statistics, computer science, expert systems, machine learning, and database science. Because it is a new field, universities are only now beginning to add courses and degrees dedicated to this field of study. In addition, because there are so few courses, there is only a limited selection of texts from which to choose. In particular, there are few texts that are appropriate for use in an introductory course. Dr. Dan-iel Larose addresses this issue with his latest text: Discovering Knowledge in Data: An Introduction to Data
Mining . This text is written to be used in an introduction to data mining course for graduate and upper level undergraduate students who may come from a wide variety of academic backgrounds. Prof. Larose has considerable experience in this area, as he was the founder and current director of Central Connecticut State University  X  s graduate program in data mining (http://www.ccsu.edu/datamining).

The text is grouped into 11 chapters based upon the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) approach to data mining. The first chapter gives an overview of CRISP and clearly describes each of the steps. Following this introduction, the second and third chapters focus on the data understand-ing steps of CRISP. The next seven chapters focus on different modeling techniques, and finally the last chapter describes model evaluation techniques. A strength of this book  X  s organization is the author  X  s  X  X  X hite box X  X  approach to data mining. In this approach, the author steps the reader through many of the modeling algorithms and gives case studies of real world data mining applications. Furthermore, the author provides examples using actual large-scale data sets using real world mining tools such as SPSS Clementine, SAS
Enterprise Miner, and Insightful Miner. The text contains over 90 exercises that allow the student to assess their level of understanding, and there are also over 70  X  X  X ands on X  X  analysis problems so that the student can learn by actually doing real data mining. Another strength in the organization of this book is that each of the chapters are  X  X  X uick reads X  X  and do not require extensive time for the student to grasp the material.

As stated above, Chapters 2 and 3 deal with preprocessing and analyzing the data respectively. The author does a good job with these chapters, particularly Chapter 3. This is important because in the opinion of this reviewer, 90% of the success in building a good model comes from accurate data scrubbing and data analysis. In Chapter 2, the author presents data scrubbing, specifically handling missing data and identify-ing outliers. Although this chapter is good in general, the section on missing data should have been expanded. For example, the text gives three methods for filling in missing data: (1) use a predefined con-stant (2) use an average value such as mean, median, or mode, or (3) use a random variable, but does not discuss other important and widely used techniques of data imputation such as building a model (usu-ally a tree) to fill in the missing values. One of the better features of Chapter 2 was the author  X  s discussion of outliers. The author clearly and concisely describes why identifying outliers is important and methods for handling them. This is important because ignoring outliers is a common mistake of people new to data mining.

In Chapter 3, the author describes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. This section is partic-ularly well done and even seasoned veterans of data mining could benefit from reading this chapter. In this section, the author uses a data set from a cell phone company to predict customer attrition (also known as  X  X  X hurn X  X ). Throughout this chapter the author methodically goes through all of the variables and examines each of them for correlation and predictability using a range of techniques. By the end of the chapter, the author has succeeded in identifying variables that are predictive of churn and variables that are highly cor-related with one another. From these results, the author is able to prune a large data set down to a small number of predictive variables from which a model can be built. The chapter is basically a  X  X  X ookie cutter X  X  approach to EDA, and a student can apply the skills learned in this chapter to nearly any other data set.
This is an important topic and the author did a good job on it. The only criticism of this section would be that the graphs should have been presented in color. Doing so would have made this chapter even more instructive.

Chapters 4 through 10 deal with building models once the data has been scrubbed and analyzed. The author devotes one chapter each to the most important modeling approaches including statistics, decision trees, clusters, and association rules. In Chapter 4, the author starts off with the techniques that are prob-ably most familiar to students: statistical models. The author gives a brief but thorough discussion of the different statistical techniques used in data mining including univariate and multivariate regression. This chapter is not meant to be comprehensive because the material contained in it could easily fill several college courses. However, the student reading this chapter will have a good understanding of the basics and will be able to build models using any of the aforementioned data mining tools. A small criticism of this particular chapter is that the author neglects to discuss logistic regression. This is an important topic, particularly when dealing with Boolean target variables such as the previously mentioned  X  X  X ell phone company churn data X  X . Possibly the author is leaving this for the next volume in the series, but it could have been covered in this text since it is not too difficult to understand.

In the next three chapters, the author discusses other modeling techniques, the most important of which are decision trees and neural networks. The chapter on decision trees was well done. It covers both the
CART and the C4.5 algorithms, and describes their differences and similarities. The chapter is short and to the point and makes good use of an example to explain the concept of trees. Students should have no difficulty understanding the material and should be able to develop their own decision tree models and ex-plain the results after reading this chapter. The chapter on neural networks was particularly impressive.
This is a difficult concept, but it was explained in simple terms and was not unnecessarily technical. Most importantly, to truly understand neural networks, one must understand what is happening within the  X  X  X lack box X  X  of the net. To explain this, Dr. Larose actually goes through a single step of adjusting the inter-nal weights of a neural network during the training phase. A student can follow along, see how the internal weights are trained and then understand how a neural network can  X  X  X earn X  X  when this process is applied hundreds of thousands of times.

Another frequently used analysis technique in data mining is clustering. The author devotes a chapter each to the two most widely employed methodologies: k-means clustering and Kohonen neworks. Both are explained clearly and examples are given. After the clusters are generated, the author describes how to interpret and use the output. The chapters are valuable and should convince the students that this is a tool that should almost always be applied as part of any data mining project. A criticism of both chapters was that the author did not provide enough analysis and interpretation of the clusters. The analysis that was provided was quite good, but it was too brief. Adding a few more pages of discussion of the clusters would have been useful.

Finally, the last chapter on modeling dealt with rule generation. It was pleasantly surprising to see a chapter on this subject, because this is an introductory text and the concept can be difficult. However, it is an important technique particularly with market basket analysis so it was good that it was included. As with the other chapters before it, the author does not make the mistake of going into too great of depth.
Instead, he focuses on presenting the key concepts and presenting enough information that a student can develop models competently and explain the results.

In the last chapter of the book, the author gives an overview of standard methods for evaluating math-ematical models. The author was successful in presenting these ideas, and they should be easily understood.
Furthermore, the author is presents the concept of cost benefit analysis. Many times, a person new to data mining will make the mistake of thinking that the most accurate model is the best while completely ignoring the fact that a less accurate model might actually generate more profit. So, along with the standard lift charts, gains charts, and confusion matrices, the author presents the concept of calculating the costs of a  X  X  X alse positive X  X  and a  X  X  X alse negative X  X  and the benefits of a correct answer.
In addition to the text described above, the author provides a companion web site that contains the data sets used in the text, an error list, and in the future will include solutions to the exercises. It might be useful at a future date for the author to also post the SPSS Clementine, SAS Enterprise Miner, and
Insightful Miner projects that were used as examples in the text. It was obvious that a significant amount of work went into these examples and students would certainly benefit from them. The author also provides other resources and links on this companion web site that all data miners will find useful. One criticism is that as of the time of the writing of this review, the publisher provided no links or references to this com-panion web site. It was not difficult to locate the site via a web search, but there is still no reason not to have the link at the publisher  X  s site. For reference, the companion website is http://www.datamining-consultant.com/.

In summary, Discovering Knowledge in Data: An Introduction to Data Mining by Daniel T. Larose, Ph.D. is a well-written book and a pleasure to read. Students who use this text should have no problem getting up to speed in the field of data mining. They will be able to quickly generate mathematical models and will understand their results. The book lays a good foundation for students who wish to continue their studies and take more advanced classes in data mining. Additionally, this book is recommended for professionals who will benefit from studying how another experienced data miner approaches the data mining process.
As stated above, there are some minor criticisms with this text, but they are outweighed by its many strong points. Therefore, this book is recommended without reservation.
