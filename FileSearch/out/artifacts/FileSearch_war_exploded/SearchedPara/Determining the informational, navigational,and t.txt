 1. Introduction
The World Wide Web (Web) has become an indispensable tool in the daily lives of many people, and search engines provide critical access to Web resources. With nearly 70% of Web searchers using a search engine as daily basis for accessing the information, Internet sites, services, and other resources on the Web. Although popular, how are people using Web search engines to accomplish their intended goal? How can we determine what it is that these people are actually seeking? What task, need, or goal are these people trying to address with their Web searching?
Belkin (1993) states that one can classify searching episodes in terms of (1) goal of the interaction, (2) method of interaction, (3) mode of retrieval and (4) type of resource interacted with during the search.
Web searching certainly possesses these aspects, so Web searching has continuity with earlier searching interactions, such as library systems. However, Web searching differs in three respects (i.e., context, scale, and variety), making it a unique domain of study. The first difference is that the direct availability of con-tent accessible on the Web is nearly ubiquitous. Web search engines provide access to textual and multime-dia content in a wide variety of settings including both home and work, as well as in mobile situations.
Second, there is the number of searchers attempting to access this content via Web search engines. The scale of topics submitted by these users is surely unparalleled in pre-Web end user searching. Third, the variety of content, users, and systems is certainly unique. This combined diversity on the Web in both content and users is extreme.

In response to this diversity, Web search engines service a variety of purposes for users. In addition to sat-isfying information problems, modern Web search engines are navigational tools to take users to specific uni-form resource locators (URLs) or to aid in browsing. People use search engines as applications to conduct e-commerce transactions, such as with sponsored search or Google X  X  payment system. Search engines provide access to content collections of images, songs, and videos rather than directly addressing an information need with a specific object. Search engines provide access to transactional services such as maps, online auctions, driving directions, or even other search engines. Search engines perform social networking functions, as with
Yahoo! Answers. Web search engines are spell checkers, thesauruses, and dictionaries. They are games, such as Google Whacking or vanity searching. Modern Web search engines are adding an increasing diverse range of features. Providers are placing more and highly varied content and services on the Web. In response, people are employing search engines in new, novel, and increasing diverse ways.

It is this cornucopia of alternatives where Web search engines differ most from classic information search and pre-Web retrieval systems. Referring back to facets outlined by Belkin, the method of interaction has remained the same (i.e., enter query, retrieve results, scan results, view results, refine query as needed). The mode of retrieval is similar, albeit within a hypermedia environment ( Marchionini, 1995 ). In terms of goals and type of resources, however, the changes are dramatic. In fact, the facets of goals and range of resources are classic examples of the long tail effect of the Web. Namely, the Web has extended significantly both the range of search goals for people and the range of resources available ( Anderson, 2006 ), and these resources need not be informational. We refer to the type of resource desired in the user X  X  expression to the system they are looking for by more clearly identifying the intent behind the query.

In this research, we developed a methodology to classify user intent in Web searching. We categorized user searches based on intent in terms of the type of content specified by the query and other user expressions, and we operationalized these classifications with defining characteristics. We implemented these catagories in a program that automatically classified Web search engine queries. We discuss how one can use this approach to improve Web search engine performance by provide more results in line with searchers X  underlying intent.
The next section presents related research concerning modeling Web queries. 2. Related studies
Research aimed at discovering the intent of Web searchers is a growing field of Web focus. Determining the underlying intent of user searches has the potential to drastically improve system performance of Web search e-commerce. User intent research falls into three sub-areas, which are: (1) empirical studies and surveys of search engine use, (2) manual analysis of search engine transaction logs, and (3) automatic classification of
Web searches. We discuss each in the following sub-sections. 2.1. User studies examining user intent on the Web
Several researchers have examined elements of user intent on the Web using a variety of controlled studies, surveys, and direct observation. Given the hypermedia environment of the Web, browsing has received a lot of attention. Carmel, Crawford, and Chen (1992) distinguished three types of browsing: (1) search-oriented cess of scanning to finding interesting information, and (3) scan browsing which is the process of scanning to find information with no reviewing or integration involved. Marchionini (1995) articulated similar browsing patterns as directed browsing, semi-directed browsing, and undirected browsing.

Others have looked at the how users approach searching and how they implement it. O X  X ay and Jeffries (1993) outlined three broad search strategies, which are monitoring, following a plan, and exploring. Navar-ro-Prieto, Scaife, and Rogers (1999) categorized searching tasks as fact finding and exploratory. Byrne, John,
Wehrle, and Crow (1999) developed a  X  X askonomy X  of Web tasks. Choo, Betlor, and Turnbull (1998) devel-oped a behavior model of Web searching defining tasks as formal search, informal search, monitoring, and monitoring, and collect. Even in this early work, we see a growing list of labels for very similar approaches to searching.

From a focus on tactics, research moved to classifying user goals. Rozanski, Bollman, and Lipman (2001) and surfing. Chi, Pirolli, Chen, and Pitkow (2001) examine computational methods for relating user needs to actions using information scent. Sellen, Murphy, and Shaw (2002) classified information seeking as finding, information gathering, browsing, and transacting. Bodoff (2004) did a classification of Web searching user goals.

In a return to some of the earlier browsing research, Teevan, Alvarado, Ackerman, and Karger (2004) dis-cuss teleporting queries, defined as when a person attempts to go directly to an information target. The researchers viewed users engaged in teleporting as wanting to get to the  X  X icinity X  of the information in ques-tion and then searching locally to find the particular desired content. The researchers report that the study participants utilized keyword search in 39% of their searches, despite usually knowing their information need up front.
 Recently, researchers have begun to quantify how often certain types of user searching occur. For example,
Kellar, Watters, and Shepherd (2007) conducted a field study of 21 participants in which they recorded logs of the Web usage of the participants. In the area of information seeking, the researchers identified the tasks of fact finding, in both active and passive manner, information gathering, browsing, and transactions. Fact find-ing tasks accounted for 18%. Information gathering tasks accounted for 13% of Web usage. 2.2. Analysis of search logs Rather than relying on empirical lab or panel studies, other researchers have used search logs from actual
Web search engines or survey results from actual Web search engine users engaged in real Web searching contexts.

Broder (2002) proposed three broad user intent classifications of navigational, informational, and transac-tional for Web queries. Using survey results, Broder reported that approximately 73% of queries were infor-mational, nearly 26% were navigational, and an estimated 36% were transactional. The researcher placed some queries into multiple categories. Based solely on the log analysis, Border reports that 48% of the queries were informational, 20% navigational and 30% transactional. We assume the remaining 2% were unclassifiable or the result of rounding.

Spink and Jansen (2004) report that e-commerce-related queries varied from approximately 12% to 24% using various Web search engine transaction logs. Jansen, Spink, and Pedersen (2005) stated that there appeared to be a significant use of search engines as a navigation appliance. The researchers report that the top 15 queries from a 2002 AltaVista search log (i.e., google, yahoo, ebay, yahoo.com, hotmail, hot-mail.com, thumbzilla, www.yahoo.com , babelfish, mapquest, nfl.com, nfl, weather, www.hotmail.com ,and google.com) were all likely expressions of a navigational intent. It is apparent that the hypermedia environ-ment of the Web provides a unique capability of using searching a specialized form of browsing.
Rose and Levinson (2004) classified search queries using the categories of informational, navigational, and the results the searcher clicked on, and subsequent queries in determining the user intent classification. Rose and Levinson (2004) reported that approximately 62% of the queries were informational, 13% navigational, and 24 percent resource. The researchers report only small differences in results when using the additional information beyond the query. 2.3. Automatic query classification
The analyses of search logs mentioned above were all performed manually, but some researchers have attempted automatic classification of user intent. Lee, Liu, and Cho (2005) automatically classified informa-tional and navigational queries using 50 queries collected from computer science students at a US university.
Their success rate for all 50 queries was 54%. Kang and Kim (2003) attempted to classify queries as either topic or homepage. After several iterations of classification, the researchers reported a classification rate of 91 percent finding using selected TREC topics (50 topic and 150 homepage finding) and portions of the
WT10g test collection. However, query classification using retrieved Web documents has been shown to be 2007 ).

Dai et al. (2006) examined classifying whether or not a Web query has a commercial intent, noting that 38% of search queries have commercial intention. Baeza-Yates, Calder  X  on-Benavides, and Gonz  X  alez (2006) used supervised and unsupervised learning to classify 6,042 Web queries as either informational, not informational, or ambiguous, achieving precision of classification of about 50%. Nettleton, Calderon, and Baeza-Yates (2006) used 65,282 queries along with click stream data and clustered these queries based on various param-transactional. 2.4. Synthesis of prior work
From a review of existing literature, we identified several trends. First, there have been a bewildering number of classifications of intent for similar or related Web searching. Second, the majority of the work has been lab studies with little use of actual Web transaction logs. Third, efforts at classification of Web queries have usually involved small quantities of queries manually classified. Fourth, there has been little effort on automatically classifying large numbers of Web queries for user intent. Finally, there has been little discussion of what is actually meant by user intent or what the theoretical underpinnings of the con-cept are.

In order to compare results across studies and move the field forward, a set of common identifiers for var-ious types of user intent must be utilized. In fact, there must be some agreement on what intent actually is. To complement the various lab and panel studies, there must be an increase in the use of search log data where beneficial, we must explore automated methods in order to have direct impact on system design.
These issues motivate our research. A comprehensive review of prior work and an evaluation of a substan-tial set of Web searching queries will significantly enhance the understanding of user intent in Web searching.
Deriving the underlying user intentions during Web search is critical for the further advancement of Web systems.

In the next section, we present our research objectives. We follow with a description of our research design and data analysis. We then present our results, along with a discussion of these results. We conclude with directions for future research and implications for the design of Web searching systems. 3. Research objectives
The research objectives are described below: 1. Develop a comprehensive classification of Web searching user intent.
 For research objective one, we analysed prior work in the area along with an analysis of numerous actual
Web searching transaction logs in order to develop a detail categorization of Web searching based on user intent. Given the plethora of categories and classifications, it is difficult to compare results across studies and research experiments. Such a comparison is vitally needed in order to place new research within prior work and to provide a foundation for future studies. 2. Operationalize the taxonomy of informational, navigational, and transactional for Web searching queries by identifying characteristics of each query type that will lead to real world classification.

For research objective two, we isolated characteristics of queries in each category (i.e., of informational, navigational, and transactional) that can serve as identifiers for these types of queries in operational search engines using various search logs. Although these classification have been isolated manually (c.f. Broder, 2002; Rose &amp; Levinson, 2004 ), the criteria for determining each as not been articulated. In order for the classifications to be meaningful, one must isolate defining characteristics that one can operationalize to inform the design of future searching systems. 3. Implement the informational, navigational, and transactional taxonomy by automatically classifying a large set of queries from a Web search engine and measure the effectiveness of the classification.
For this research objective, we encoded the characteristics of informational, navigational, and transactional that we identified from research objective two to develop an automatic classifier. We executed the program on a transaction log from a Web search engine containing approximately one and half million queries from several hundred thousand users.

In order to measure the effectiveness, we manually classified a sub-set of queries as informational, naviga-tional, and transactional, and we compared the results to those obtained via the automated method presented in research objective three. This provided a measure of the accuracy of the automatic classifier.
In the next section, we describe our research process in detail. 4. Research design 4.1. Classification of Web searching For research objective one, we performed a comprehensive review of prior work in the area of user intent in
Web searching. We cross correlated reported results from these studies to align user intent classes that were similar but variously labeled. We also supplemented this literature review by using results from our own data analysis. From this review and analysis, we derived a comprehensive categorization of Web searching intent and correlated this categorization with prior published works.

For the purpose of this research, we define user intent as the affective, cognitive, or situational goal as expressed in an interaction with a Web search engine. Referring to Belkin X  X  states of a searching episode (1993) , intent is akin to goal, and expression akin to method of interaction. Unlike goal, however, intent is concerned with how the goal is expressed because the expression determines what type of resource the user desires in order to address their overall goal. Pirolli (2007, p. 65) makes a similar delineation between task stratified model (1996, 1997) proposes that user expressions to an information searching system are based on affective, cognitive, or situational strata.

Certainly, the query is a key component of this expression of intent. The importance of the query is obvious by the considerable amount of research examining various aspect of query formulation, reformulation and processing ( Belkin, Cool, Croft, &amp; Callan, 1993; Belkin et al., 2003; Cronen-Townsend, Zhou, &amp; Croft, Thompson, 1987; Ingwersen, 1996; Taylor, 1968 ).

However, the query is not the only expression possible or that one can use to determine intent. Therefore, in this research, we examine other aspects of the interaction including number of query reformulations, selection of vertical, use of system feedback, and result page viewed as expressions of intent. This approach has much in common with research on implicit feedback ( Jansen, 2005, 2006; Jansen &amp; McNeese, 2005; Kelly &amp; Belkin, 2001, 2004; Kelly &amp; Teevan, 2003; Oard &amp; Kim, 2001 ), where one attempts to use other expressions of the user as forms of relevance judgments.
 4.2. Characteristics of Web queries
For research objective two, we qualitatively analysed samples of queries from seven Web search engine transaction logs from three Web search engines in order to identify characteristics for various user intent cat-Web transaction logs used in this research are shown in Table 1 .

For this process, we selected random samples of records containing not only the query but also other attri-attributes beyond the query terms in order to assist in the classification. For the analysis, we manually clas-sified the queries in one of three categories (informational, navigational, and transactional). Derived from work in Rose and Levinson (2004) , we define the intent within each category as:
Informational searching: The intent of informational searching is to locate content concerning a particular topic in order to address an information need of the searcher. The content can be in a variety of forms, including data, text, documents, and multimedia. The need can be along a spectrum from very precise to very vague.

Navigational searching: The intent of navigational searching is to locate a particular Website. The Website can be that of a person or organization. It can be a particular Web page, site or a hub site. The searcher may have a particular Website in mind, or the searcher may just  X  X hink X  a particular Website exists.
Transactional searching: The intent of transactional searching is to locate a Website with the goal to obtain some other product, which may require executing some Web service on that Website. Examples include purchase of a product, execution of an online application, or downloading multimedia.

We then derived characteristics for each informational, navigational, and transactional category that would ries. These sub-classifications were derived using both prior work and a priori using open coding technique which takes a grounded theory approach ( Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990 ) to deriving categories. By utilizing seven transactions logs from three Web search engines, we believe that we obtained results that are generalizable across multiple search engines and user demographic populations. 4.3. Automatic classification of Web queries
To address research objective three, we used the characteristics from research objective two to develop an automatic classifier, and we then executed this program on a Web transaction log.
 The transaction log we used for this research objective was from Dogpile.com ( http://www.dogpile.com/ ).
A complete statistical analysis of the Dogpile transaction log is presented in Jansen, Spink, Blakely, and Kosh-man (2006) . The results indicate the user searching characteristics are consistent with those observed on other Web search engines, such as those reported in Jansen and Spink (2005b), Park, Bae, and Lee (2005) Silverstein,
Henzinger, Marais, and Moricz (1999) . Therefore, we expect the classifications to be also similar to other Web search engines.

For data collection, we logged searches executed on Dogpile.com on 6 May 2005. The original search log contained 4,056,374 records, representing a portion of the searches executed on that date. tained several fields, including: User identification : A user code automatically assigned by the Web server to identify a particular computer.
Cookie : An anonymous cookie automatically assigned by the Dogpile.com server to identify unique users on a particular computer.
 Time of day : Measured in hours, minutes, and seconds as recorded by the Dogpile.com server. Query terms : Terms exactly as entered by the given user.

Source : The content collection that the user selects to search (e.g. Web, Images, Audio, or Video) with Web being the default.

We imported the original flat ASCII transaction log file of 4,056,374 records into a relational database. We Cookie , and Query to locate the initial query and recreate the chronological series of actions in a session.
Since we were interested only in queries submitted by humans and the transaction log also contained que-ries from agents, we removed all the agent submissions that we could identify using an upper cut-off similar to human Web searchers. This approach certainly introduced some agent or common user terminal sessions; however, it also ensured that we had included most of the queries submitted primarily by human searchers.
Web search engine logging systems of Web search engines usually record result pages viewing as separate records with an identical user identification and query, but with a new time stamp (i.e., the time of the second skew the query calculations. To account for this, we collapsed the search log using user identification, cookie, and query. We calculated the number of identical queries by user, storing in a separate field within the trans-action log. This collapsed transaction log provided us the data by user for analysing user queries without skewing by result list viewing. We also removed all records with null queries. After processing the transaction log, the database contained 1,523,793 queries from 534,507 users (identified by unique IP address and cookie) containing 4,250,656 total terms.

We then used the program we create to classify each query according to the characteristics developed in research question two. The algorithm for the classification was: Algorithm: Web Query Classification based on User Intent
Assumptions: 1. Transaction log is sorted by IP address, cookie, and time (ascending order by time). 2. Search engine result page requested are removed. 3. Null queries are removed. 4. Queries are primarily English terms.
 Input:
Record R i with IP address (IP i ), cookies ( K i ), query Q
Record R i +1 with IP address (IP i +1 ), cookies ( K i +1
I: conditions of information query characteristics N: conditions of navigational query characteristics T: conditions of transactional query characteristics Variable: B: Boolean // (if query matches conditions,  X  X es X  else  X  X o X )
Output: Classification of User Intent, C begin Move to R i (this module establishes the initial boundary condition) Store values for IP i , K i , Q i , Fi , and QL i Compare ( IP i , K i , Q i , Fi , and QL i ) to N While not end of file ( R i +1 now becomes R i )
Store values for R i +1 as IP i , K i , Q i , S i , and QL end loop
To address the effectiveness of classification, we selected a random sample of 400 queries from the Dogpile transaction log and manually classified these queries. We use a Delphi approach, where each evaluator inde-pendently rated each query. The three evaluators met to come to an aggregate classification. Once all evalu-ators had agreed to a common classification for all queries, we then compared our manual classification results to the classification results from our program in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm. 5. Results 5.1. Research objective one
For research objective one (Develop a comprehensive classification of Web searching user intent), we pres-ent in Table 2 a three-level hierarchical taxonomy, with the top most level being informational, navigational, also can involve a third level classification.

Below this developed taxonomy, Table 2 presents user intent studies and their best-fit classification across studies. The blank spaces indicate gaps in prior work where the particular study did not address a specific type particular study classification crosses multiple categories.
 Table 3 presents definitions of each of the classifications in the user intent taxonomy.

All query examples in Table 3 are from the Dogpile transaction log used in this research for automatic clas-sification. These high level classifications are the same as presented by Broder (2002) and are similar to those reported by Rose and Levinson (2004) . Prior work has dealt mostly with informational and navigation search-ing, with few works focusing on transactional searching. In our analysis, we have noted that informational searching has five subcomponents (directed, undirected, find, list, and advice), for which we used labels pro-posed by Rose and Levinson (2004) .

Navigational searching appears to exhibit itself in two sub-categories, (navigation to a transactional site or appropriate Website. Naturally, from a user perspective, there may be follow-on goals once the user arrives at a particular destination. So, one can view navigational searching as an expression of an intermediate intent aimed at satisfying some larger searching goal.

Interestingly, transactional searching is extremely nuanced with four sub-categories (obtain, download, offered by modern Web search engines. This classification represents those searches for which the Web search search engine results page, such as suggestions for correct spelling or terms in the results title, URL, or snippet. 5.2. Research objective two
For research objective two (Operationalize the taxonomy of informational, navigational, and transactional for Web searching queries by identifying characteristics of each query type that will lead to real world classi-fication.), we derived the following characteristics for each category.
 5.2.1. Navigational searching queries containing company/business/organization/people names; queries containing domains suffixes; queries with  X  X eb X  as the source; queries length (i.e., number of terms in query) less than 3; and searcher viewing the first search engine results page. 5.2.2. Transactional searching queries containing terms related to movies, songs, lyrics, recipes, images, humor, and porn; queries with  X  X btaining X  terms (e.g. lyrics, recipes, etc.); queries with  X  X ownload X  terms (e.g. download, software, etc.); queries relating to image, audio, or video collections; queries with  X  X udio X ,  X  X mages X , or  X  X ideo X  as the source; queries with  X  X ntertainment X  terms (pictures, games, etc.); queries with  X  X nteract X  terms (e.g. buy, chat, etc.); and queries with movies, songs, lyrics, images, and multimedia or compression file extensions (jpeg, zip, etc.). 5.2.3. Informational searching uses question words (i.e.,  X  X ays to X ,  X  X ow to X ,  X  X hat is X , etc.); queries with natural language terms; queries containing informational terms (e.g. list, playlist, etc.); queries that were beyond the first query submitted; queries where the searcher viewed multiple results pages; queries length (i.e., number of terms in a query) greater than 2; and queries that do not meet criteria for navigational or transactional.

Some navigational queries were quite easy to identify, especially those queries containing portions of URLs or even complete URLs. Although it may seem counter intuitive to some, it has been noted in prior work that many Web searchers type in portions of URLs into search boxes as a shortcut to typing the complete URL in the address box of a browser ( Jansen et al., 2005 ). We also classified company and organizational names as navigation queries, assuming that the user intended to go to the Website of that company or organization.
Naturally, there may be other reasons for a user entering a URL or proper name. We also noted that most navigation queries were short in length and occurred at the beginning of the user session.

Identification of transactional queries was primarily via term and content analysis, with identification of key terms related to transactional domains such as entertainment and e-commerce.

With the relatively clear characteristics of navigational and transactional queries, informational queries became the catchall by default. However, we did note characteristics that indicated informational searching.
The most pronounced was the use of natural language phrases. Informational queries were also more likely to be lengthier and, sessions of informational searching were longer in terms of the number of queries submitted.
For each of these classifications, we developed databases of key terms relating to each. We employed this database of key terms in our automatic classifier. For conditional characteristics such as query length and ses-sion length, we used program variables. 5.3. Research objective three
For research objective three (Implement the informational, navigational, and transactional taxonomy by automatically classifying a large set of queries from a Web search engine and measure the effectiveness of the classification.), we implemented the attributes we derived in research question two in a program. We then executed the program on the Dogpile search engine transaction log, with Table 4 presenting the results.
Table 4 shows that more than 80% of Web queries were as informational in intent, with navigational and transactional queries each representing about 10% of Web queries. We find this a surprising high percentage of informational queries. Prior work has reported that navigational intent was significantly represented in Web searching ( Broder, 2002; Jansen et al., 2005 ). For example, Broder (2002) reports navigational queries of 24% based on approximately 3,100 survey responses and 20% based on an analysis of 400 Web queries.
The low percentage of transactional queries is also surprising. Broder (2002) reports transactional queries of 36% based on survey responses and 30% based on the analysis of Web query. Jansen and Spink (2005b) report that e-commerce-related queries ranged from 12% to 24% based on analysis of approximately 2,500 queries from multiple transaction logs.

The variation in reported percentage of navigational and transactional queries may be related to the size of the samples used in prior studies (which were much smaller than we used in this research) and the power log distribution of Web queries. Jansen et al. (2005) reported on the most frequently occurring queries, so navi-gational queries may be more prevalent in the more frequently occurring queries than the entire distribution, especially those in the long tail. A similar effect may be happening with transactional queries. Rose and Lev-inson (2004) classified only the initial query in the session. These approaches may have led to the increased percentage of navigational and transactional queries.

For measuring the effectiveness of automatic query classification, we randomly selected 400 queries and manually classified them and compared the results to those obtained via automatic classification. The results are shown in Table 5 .

Table 5 shows that approximately 26% of the 400 queries were misclassified by the automated method. Pri-marily, the algorithm under classified transactional and navigational queries and over classified informational queries. Assuming that these percentages hold throughout the dataset, informational queries would occur approximately 65%, navigational queries approximately 15 percent, and transactional queries about 20%.
However, these percentages are based on an assumption that the manual classifications are correct, namely that a particular query, as an expression of a user need, has one and only one intent. Naturally, multiple users may use the same query as an expression of different underlying intent. This relates to our comment earlier concerning possible multiple intents with entering a URL or company name.

From our analysis and review of the datasets, about 70 X 80% of the queries can be classified into one cat-egory will a high degree of confidence. The remaining queries are more problematic and may represent multi-ple intents. This is where most of the misclassifications occurred. For example, we manually classified the query  X  X reo X  as a navigational query (assuming that the searcher wanted to go to the Oreo cookie Website).
However, one could also, with a lower probability, classify it as an informational query. Other examples include  X  X elda sheet music X ,  X  X taly government X , and  X  X others day poem X . Each of these queries could have mul-tiple underlying intents. This points to the need for a probabilistic classification for that least a sub-set of queries.

However, based on our analysis, it appears that this is a relatively small sub-set of Web searcher, approx-imately 25%. With an accuracy of nearly 75%, this research shows that automatic classification of user intent is achievable using data that is currently available to most Web search engines. 6. Discussion and implications
In this study, we employed a three-level classification of Web searching that is useful in identifying the intent of the searcher. This model is based on our own analysis and on prior published work, most notably that of Broder (2002) and Rose and Levinson (2004) . However, Broder (2002) did not present a description of the process and metrics used to classify the queries. Similarly, Rose and Levinson (2004) also did not elab-classifications are meaningful for use by Web searching systems and for other studies.

Additionally, this research demonstrates the ability to implement our approach for automatically classify-ing queries. Our automated approach achieved a 74% successfully classification rate. Comparing this with other attempts at automatic classifications, we see that this success rate is quite good. Lee et al. (2005) had a 54% success rate with 50 queries. Kang and Kim (2003) had a 91% success rate but used documents from a TREC test collection. Baeza-Yates et al. (2006) achieved an approximately 50% success rate after clustering queries. These prior works used much smaller data sets, had higher error rates, and did not classify informa-tional, navigational, and transactional queries. Not only does our approach have a success rate better than that reported in prior work, it uses a much larger data set of queries, does not depend on external content, and can be implemented in real time. This makes it a viable solution for Web search engines as they attempt to provide relevant content to users.

In analysing our results, we are aware of certain limitations that may restrict the ability to generalize our conclusions. One issue is that the Dogpile user population may not be representative of Web search engine users in general. Therefore, their queries would not be representative of the general Web population. We would certainly like to apply our classification methods on data from other major search engines. This may also involve a qualitative analysis of newer transaction logs than the ones we used in this study. Perhaps such logs would provide increased clarity on characteristics of various user intents. However, Jansen and Spink (2005b) report that query characteristics across search engines are fairly consistent. Additionally, we derived our initial characteristics from seven other transaction logs from three other search engines. Therefore, we would expect similar results from other datasets.

Another limitation is that we assigned each query to one and only one category. We are aware that a query ability of classifying a query into one or more categories. However, from results of this research, it appears that approximately 75% of queries can be classified into a single category of intent (i.e., informational, nav-igational, or transactional) with a high degree of certainty.
 Our findings are also limited by the inherent shortcoming of relying solely on data from transaction logs.
Transaction logs are excellent for collecting large amounts of data from a large number of users engaged in real searching tasks. However, we do not have access to these users, so we can only infer their intent from the data available. It would be an exciting area of future research to conduct a laboratory study to gain further insight into the underlying intent of Web searchers. Such a laboratory study would be a good supplement to the transaction log research presented here.

The strengths of this study are the variety and quantity of the datasets employed. Broder (2002) and Rose and Levinson (2004) both used a very small number of queries and classified the queries manually, with no presentation of the metrics used. Lee et al. (2005) used 50 queries, and Kang and Kim (2003) used 200 queries.
Baeza-Yates et al. (2006) used approximately 65,000 queries but clustered them before categorizing them. Our dataset had over one and half million queries. Therefore, our results are robust.

In terms of implications, the approach used in this research can be implemented for real time classification the user intent of Web queries in real time, Web search engines can provide more relevant results to searchers and more precisely targeted sponsored links. This is especially fruitful in the area of transactional queries.
Assuming that transactional queries carry a higher commercial inclination, these would be the queries that online advertising would be most interested. For these users, Web search engines could more heavily weight results with commercial content or sponsored links, for example. Similarly, targeted actions could be taken for navigational and informational queries.

There are several areas for future research. As mentioned, a laboratory study would be a good complement to this log analysis. Such a laboratory study might be able to shed further light in how searchers express their underlying intent. Additionally, a detailed qualitative analysis on a search log from a major search engine might lead to more granular attributes of user intent. We would like to develop algorithmic approaches for utilizing this knowledge of user intent in order to provide searchers with more targeted results. Finally, we are aiming to expand our automated classification methods to include the more granular categories at level two and three. 7. Conclusion and further research
In order for Web search engines to continue to improve, they must leverage an increased knowledge of user of Web queries based on user intent. These characteristics were derived from an examination of Web queries from multiple search engine transaction logs. We have also demonstrated an automated method that can suc-cessfully classify Web queries based on user intent. Web search engines can use this knowledge for more pre-cisely associating user goals with queries and thereby providing more targeted content. If Web search engines can determine search goals based on queries and other interactions, designers can leverage this knowledge by implementing algorithms and interfaces to help users achieve their searching goals.
