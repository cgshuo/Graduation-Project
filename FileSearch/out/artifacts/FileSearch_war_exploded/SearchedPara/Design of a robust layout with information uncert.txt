 1. Introduction
Layout problems are generally addressed using optimization approaches ( Drira et al., 2007 ). Unfortunately, at the time when a system is designed, the information required for this optimization about the production to be carried out by the future system is not known with certainty. This is typically the case for the production demand of each part. Forecasts can be used but, if they can be accurate on the short term, they turn out to be much more difficult to obtain on the medium terms and can even become inaccurate on the long term. Indeed, it is known that the markets are subjected to strong fluctuations and the customers X  demand can change over time. As noted in Gupta and Seifoddini (1990) and Page (1991) , 1/3 of USA companies undergo major reorganization of the production facilities every 2 years and on average, 40% of a company X  X  sales come from new products. Thus, far forecasts are much less reliable than close ones ( Balakrishnan and Cheng, 2009 ). In such circumstances, the problem that arises is how to design an efficient layout of machines on the surface of a workshop, while taking into account the fact that the farer a forecast the less reliable the quality of the information is? In this respect, in the following, we suggest an approach that takes into account the fact that data related to the future production to fulfill becomes more and more uncertain. In this respect, we propose a resolution strategy that divides the time into several periods and associates an uncertain production demand at each of these periods. The uncertainty increases as the considered period is farer from the present, which seems to be a realistic view of the problem.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , we introduce other published works dealing with uncertainty and fuzziness in layout design. In Section 3 ,we suggest an approach to layout design with accounts for this increase of uncertainty over time. The corresponding fuzzy problem is then more formally stated in Section 4. Finally, in Sections 5 and 6 , we propose an evolutionary approach and experiment it on several test examples. The con-clusion and future works terminate the article. 2. Dealing with uncertainty in layout design: Related research
According to Azadivar and Wang (2000) , a facility layout problem is defined as the determination of the relative locations for, and allocation of, the available space among a given number of facilities. To arrange these facilities, it is necessary to use several types of data related to the production, which typically includes quantities of products to be manufactured. Numerous research works are concerned with layout design in the literature.
Recently, uncertainty in the layout design has emerged as an important issue ( Kulturel-Konak, 2007 ).

Drira et al. (2007) have published an extended survey of the research in layout design. From this work, we can note that most published researches address static problems, which assume that the production data, once established, are relevant enough to characterize the conditions for future production of the system.
Unfortunately, this assumption is far from reality. As a conse-quence, several authors have suggested to incorporate uncer-tainty and/or imprecision in their resolution approaches. Among these works we can distinguish, stochastic formulations ( Meng et al., 2004 ) and fuzzy formulations, which seems to be the most commonly adopted. Grobelny (1986 , 1987a , 1987b) presents a fuzzy approach applied to layout problems where the factors affecting the layout are described by linguistic variables. Infer-ence rules are used to link the fuzzy input variables to fuzzy output variables. For each pair of facilities, these rules are combined and the result is then defuzzified and exploited in construction heuristics. In this way, Dweiri and Meier (1996) and Dweiri (1999) , consider the product flow, information flow, personal flow, material handling equipment flow, environmental conditions and personal supervision as fuzzy factors that affect the layout. The weights associated to each factor are estimated by an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) which is based on the relative importance given by the decision maker. Then, a con-struction heuristic allows the design of the layout. Deb and
Bhattacharyya (2003 , 2005) address the problem of placing facilities using a multi-input fuzzy system: the flow of personnal, supervisory relationships, environmental conditions and the flow of information. The fuzzy inference rules link all factors to the output variable, which is the proximity rate. Defuzzification specifies, for each pair of facilities, the rate of proximity and the one who has the higher rate has priority to be placed. However, these approaches address qualitative, but not quantitative aspects of the layout, such as production requests, flows between machines, etc. A limited number of articles are concerned with such characteristics. In this context, fuzzy numbers can offer interesting possibilities to deal with the uncertainties and inac-curacies ( Aiello and Enea, 2001 ). The use of fuzzy numbers is introduced in Gen et al. (1995) . The authors address a multi-line layout. They model clearances between adjacent facilities with fuzzy numbers. The membership degree of horizontal distances and vertical distances between pairs of facilities is to be max-imized. Genetic algorithms are used as resolution approach.
Cheng et al. (1996) represents the flows between facilities by fuzzy numbers and solve the resulting optimization problem using a genetic algorithm. In the same context, Aiello and Enea (2001) show the interest of fuzzy numbers to model uncertainty in the market demands and incorporate constraints on the maximum capacities of the departments. The authors apply their approach to a simple case of a linear layout with 4 facilities to minimize the total material handling cost. Enea et al. (2005) consider departments with finite production capacity and flows between them are modeled by triangular fuzzy numbers. Authors developed a genetic fuzzy algorithm and the comparison of layouts is based on the integral value. The efficiency of their approach is tested on 6 departments X  facility layout.
An important limitation of these works is that, although they use fuzziness to represent uncertain situations, they assume that the fuzzy characterization of the demand does not change over time. Nevertheless, it is well known that nowadays, manufactur-ing plants must be able to respond quickly to changes in demand, production volume and product mix ( De  X  gre  X  s et al., 2008 ). Page (1991) reported that, on average, 40% of a company X  X  sales come from new products. However, the change in product mix yields to modify the production flow and thus affects the layout. Gupta and Seifoddini (1990) stated that 1/3 of USA companies undergo major reorganization of the production facilities every two years. To cope with this drawback, certain researchers have suggested layout design approaches with several time periods (i.e., dynamic layouts), and have used probabilistic distributions to take into account possible changes ( Yang and Peters, 1998 ; Braglia, et al., 2003 ). Yang and Peters (1998) consider rolling horizons of planning and assume that demands are subject to multiple scenarios, each one with a probability of occurrence. The problem is solved using a matrix of flow weighted by the probabilities. On each time window, composed of a number of periods, a robust layout is defined. This layout is rearranged on the next time window. Braglia et al. (2003) study the case where demands vary according to a probability law. They present indicators to decide whether the layout must be robust or dynamic; a robust layout is an effective arrangement of facilities that do not change for multiple periods ( Pillai et al., 2011 ). Unfortunately, certain prob-abilities may turn out to be quite difficult to estimate in practice. Moreover in such research works, the authors do not take into account the degradation of the available information over time. The fact that the information quality can decrease as time advances, has been evocated in Balakrishnan and Cheng (2009 ). The authors discuss a dynamic layout problem where requests for production are subject to forecast errors that increase over time. The margins of error are fixed in each period and can be positive, negative or zero with equal probabilities. They compare two existing crisp algorithms on rolling horizons and show that such considerations are important, but they do not suggest an approach to find a layout in such a context. As a consequence, although there exist approaches that include some sort of uncertainty in their resolution strategy, there is still a need for a new method that can solve robust layout problems while taking into consideration the important fact that forecasts become less and less reliable as they become farer from the current time. 3. Dealing with less and less reliable information 3.1. Uncertainty
During the design phase of a workshop, it often arises that the product types to be manufactured are reasonably known, but the quantities that will be ordered for these products are not well known, so that rough approximations, deduced from a market study can be used. Hence, the future production volumes are uncertain. The decision maker gives, for each product p , a demand value d pl p , which is thought to be the most plausible. This demand can fluctuate between two values, minimum d min p and maximum d p . For each product p , the production demand is represented by a triangular fuzzy number ~ D p characterized by the triplet ( d p , d sentations of production demands: crisp and uncertain. 3.2. Taking into account the degradation of information on the demand of products
We consider that on the short term the available data are known with a reasonable certainty, but the more on the long term we are, the more uncertain the demand is. We could say that we have a kind of degradation of the available information as time advances. To address this important feature, we suggest decom-posing the time into intervals, called periods, and over each period, we define fuzzy approximations of the product demands.
We can then view this problem as a fuzzy dynamic layout problem, which, to our knowledge, has not been addressed in the literature. For each time period t , we can define the produc-tion demands for each product using triangular fuzzy numbers ~
D ( d uncertain as the decision horizon increases, the admissible inter-vals of demand  X  d min pt , d max pt , which limit the minimum and max-imum values of demands for each period, are wider and wider. For this purpose, and since demand is modeled by a fuzzy triangular number for each time period, the spread of ~ D pt is wider and wider from one time period to another (see Fig. 2 ). This approach allows taking into consideration a variety of situations: progressive degradation of information or sudden increase after a given period, etc. 4. Formulation of the problem addressed
Our objective is to arrange the machines on the surface of the workshop, so as to minimize the sum of transportation costs for the entire planning horizon. As several other layout articles, we will consider a discrete representation of the workshop ( Drira et al., 2007 ). In this representation, the plant site is divided into rectangular blocks with the same area and shape, and each block is assigned to one facility only. This allows various shapes of the shop floor to be taken into account, but implicitly assumes that the size and shape of the machines are approximately the same and that the distances between the available positions for these machines are about the same. The problem formulation is made as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP). The objective is to minimize the total production cost of the workshop on time periods, which consists of the sum of handling costs of products on each period of time and of the rearrangement costs of machines from a period of time to another. We have: T set of T time periods.
 M set of M machines.

V set of available positions. ~ f ijt material flow between machine i and machine j at period t . ijpt number of times that the product p is moved from machine i to machine j during period t . ijt unit cost of transporting materials from machine i and machine j at period t . d kl distance between positions k and l .

A ikl travel cost of machine i from position k to position l .
X tik binary variable equal to 1 if machine i is located to position k at period t. Otherwise, it is equal to 0.

Y tikl binary variable equal to 1 if machine i is moved from position k to position l at period t . Otherwise, it is equal to 0.
The flow of products between two machines i and j is the number of products that visit these machines and the production demand for each time period. Suppose there are N products to be produced which will use the machines i and j at the period t , then the flow between these two machines during this period is: ~ f where and are extended fuzzy addition and multiplication operators, respectively ( Klir and Yuan, 1995 ). d max d
We allow a possible reorganization of the workshop, i.e., to move the machines, because of changes in the product mix and the production volume from a time period to another. In this case, an additional reorganization cost must be taken into account to move the machines from one position to another. The mathema-tical formulation of this problem is given in (2) . Let us note that the objective function ~ F is a triangular fuzzy number ( F
F minimize ~ F  X  T Under the following constraints:
Y
X tik A 0 , 1 fg 8 i A M , 8 k A V , 8 t A T  X  6  X 
The objective function (2) represents the sum of material costs between machines, and the costs of rearrangement of machines from one period to another. Eq. (3) ensures that each position contains at most one machine in each period and Eq. (4) guarantees that each machine is assigned to a single position for all periods.
Note that the objective function (2) supposes that flows between machines are symmetric. If not, the objective function is given by Eq. (7) : minimize ~ F  X  T 5. An evolutionary fuzzy approach 5.1. General features
Because of the encouraging results reported in the literature, evolutionary algorithms have become more and more popular in solving facility layout problems ( Pierreval et al., 2003 ; Mawdesley and Al-Jibouri, 2003 ; Drira et al., 2007 ). This section presents the choices made to solve the above formulated fuzzy optimization problem.

The evolutionary search starts from an initial set of randomly selected solutions to define the initial population. The chromo-somes are evaluated according to the fitness function ~ F given in (2) . The chromosomes evolve through successive generations and are submitted to mutation and crossover. The selection of chromosomes is based on a tournament procedure between two chromosomes randomly chosen. The best one, which is deter-mined with an evaluation procedure based on the area compen-sation method, is chosen for the crossover operation. The process is iterative until a required number of generations are reached. 5.2. Coding
In static environments, the workshop configuration is repre-sented by a matrix of dimensions Lo La , where Lo is the length of the workshop and La its width. Each cell of the matrix represents a position in the workshop. The machines are represented by their number, between 1 to M ( M is the number of machines) and are assigned to a position in the matrix. If the number of available positions is greater than the number of machines, the unoccupied locations are represented by the symbol  X . This coding allows constraints (3) and (4) to be satisfied. In dynamic environments, the chromosome is a juxtaposition of the T matrices ( T is the number of time periods) which represent the layout for each period t . An illustration of a coding of a workshop of dimensions 2 3 of 4 time periods and 4 machines is given in Fig. 3 . 5.3. Evaluation of solutions
We have to compare the fuzzy cos ts associated with different solutions using Eq. (2) , which represents a criterion to be minimized. Although several researchers a pproached this problem of fuzzy comparison, there seems that the re is no standard procedure that would be considered to be the best. S everal approaches for comparing fuzzy numbers exist in the literature ( Wang and Kerre, 2001 ). In our case, we chose the surface comp ensation method developed by Fortemps and Roubens (1996) for its properties of reasonable order and its easier implementation ( Wang and Kerre, 2001 ).
Let ~ A 1 and ~ A 2 two triangular fuzzy numbers. We define the satisfied: inf I  X  ~ A 1 , a  X  Z inf I  X  ~ A 2 , a  X  X  8  X  sup I  X  ~ A 1 , a  X  Z sup I  X  ~ A 2 , a  X  X  9  X  I  X  ~
A 1 , a  X  is a fuzzy subset of a level a of ~ A 1 , I  X  ~ A of a level a of ~ A 2 .

If these relations are not satisfied, i.e., neither ~ A 1 strictly superior to other ( Fig. 4 ), an approach that aims to determine a degree of superiority of one number from another is adopted. This approach is based on the comparison of surfaces defined by membership functions of ~ A 1 and ~ A 2 according to the following integrals: S  X  ~ A 1 Z ~ A 2  X  X  S  X  ~ A 1 Z ~ A 2  X  X  where: U  X  ~
A 1 , ~ A 2  X  X  a 9 0 r a r 1 , inf I  X  ~ A 1 , a  X  Z inf I  X  S  X  ~
A 1 , ~ A 2  X  X  a 9 0 r a r 1 , sup I  X  ~ A 1 , a  X  Z sup I  X  S  X  ~
A corresponding part of ~ A 2 ( Fig. 4 ). The degree which ~ defined by Hapke et al. (2000 ):
C  X  ~
A 1 Z ~ A 2  X  X  max
The magnitude of C  X  ~ A 1 Z ~ A 2  X  represents the degree of super-iority of ~ A 1 relative to ~ A 2 . For each pair  X  ~ A 1 Low Inequality: ~ A 1 Z ~ A 2 if f C  X  ~ A 1 Z ~ A 2  X  Z 0. Strict Inequality: ~ A 1 4 ~ A 2 if f C  X  ~ A 1 Z ~ A 2  X  4 0.
Equivalence: ~ A 1 ffi ~ A 2 if f C  X  ~ A 1 Z ~ A 2  X  X  C  X  5.4. Crossover
We have developed two crossover procedures. The first one acts on the chromosomes period by period and generates two children from two parents. This operator first randomly select several posi-tions in each parents (cutting se ction), then the content of these and each opposite parent are crossed line by line. Each missed gene from the opposite parent is then transmitted to the empty position by construction, it preserves the satisfaction of the constraints.
No  X  X epair X  procedure is needed to obtain a feasible solution, which allows more information about the parents X  characteristics to be transmitted to the offspring through inheritance. An illustration of this operator is given in Fig. 5 for a chromosome with one time period.

The second crossover is a heuristic operator. It generates a single child from two parents. It is based on a heuristic that minimizes the rearrangement costs between two consecutive time periods, which is described using Algorithm 1 .
 Algorithm 1. Heuristic crossover procedure.

Step 1: Select randomly a parent and a select randomly a cut Step 2: Assign the layouts from periods 1 to t to the child. Repeat
Step 3: Compare the rearrangement costs between the child
Step 4: Assign to the child in t  X  1 period, the layout from Step 5: t  X  t  X  1 Until the child is fully built.
 This crossover can be illustrated using the following example.
Let us consider a workshop of dimensions 2 3 and 4 planning periods, and two parents P 1 and P 2 as illustrated in Fig. 6 . Let P the part of chromosome corresponding to the period t in the parent P i in and C ( t ) the part of chromosome corresponding to the period t in the child C .

Let us assume that parent P 2 is randomly chosen and period 2 is randomly selected so that the cut point is after period 2. We shown in Fig. 7 .

Then, we compare the rearrangement costs between periods 2 and 3 of the layout corresponding to C ( t 2 ) and P 1 ( t and P 2 ( t 3 ). The layout that has the lower cost of rearrangement with regard to C ( t 2 ) will be assigned to the child C ( t here that it is P 1 ( t 3 ) (as shown in Fig. 8 ).

The gene C ( t 4 ) is determined in the same way by comparing the rearrangement costs of the layouts corresponding to genes
C ( t
P ( t ) (as shown in Fig. 9 ). 5.5. Mutations
Two mutation operators were developed. The first one intro-duces a modification in each periods of time, by randomly selecting two machines and exchanging their positions. An example, con-sidering a layout for one time period, is given in Fig. 10 .
The second mutation operator consists in switching two layouts chosen randomly over two time periods. An illustrative example is given by Fig. 11 . 5.6. Structure of the genetic algorithm
The general structure of the genetic algorithm proposed is given in Algorithm 2.2. The crossover a nd mutation are performed with iteration the best solution found ( best_sol ). The program is stopped when reaching a certain number of iterations N max .Thestepsofthe developed genetic algorithm are given by Algorithm 2 . Algorithm 2. Genetic algorithm procedure.

Step 1: Generate the initial population and copy it in the Step 2: Evaluate the current population according to eq. (2).
Step 3: If the number of generations is equal to N max , then end Step 4: Create the new population.

Step 5: Update the current population by new population and 6. Experiments and results
Since our problem has not been addressed in the literature, to test the performances of the proposed algorithm, we first relax the fuzzy demands, which results in a crisp problem, which allows comparisons with the benchmarks of the literature. 6.1. Test of the evolutionary algorithm in static environment
In this section, we consider only one period of study, which leads to a static environment, so that we can make comparisons with other problems studied in the literature ( Chan and Tansari, 1994 ; Mak et al., 1998 ; El-Baz, 2004 ). Thus, we consider the problem initially addressed by Chan and Tansari (1994) . Authors show that this problem admits an optimal solution ( Fig. 12 ) whose cost is equal to 4818.
 The results obtained with our approach and those obtained by El-Baz (2004) , Mak et al. (1998) and Chan and Tansari (1994) are given in Table 1 .

According to the Table 1 , we note that our approach gives the best results. Indeed, it finds the optimal solution at least one time, in 18 cases among 19 studied. Furthermore, we find the optimal solution 10 times on 10 in two experiments (5 and 10), which is not the case with the other approaches. On 190 executions of the algorithm, we found the optimal solution 109 times against 81 times for El-Baz (2004) , 37 times for Mak et al. (1998) and 23 times for Chan and Tansari (1994). In the only case where the optimal solution was not found by our approach (Exp 1), we find a layout with a lower cost. 6.2. Test of the evolutionary algorithm in dynamic environment
The first test problem from ( Rosenbaltt, 1986 ) is a dynamic layout problem that we call Pr1, which assumes a workshop of dimensions 2 3, with 6 machines and 5 time periods. The optimal solution L 1 for this problem is known and given in Fig. 13 . It yields acrisp costof F L 1  X  71 , 187. Our evolutionary approach was able to find this optimal solution 18 times out of 20 runs performed (population size 120, probability of crossover 95%, probability of mutation 5%, number of iteration 1000).
The second test problem, from ( Conway and Venkataramanan, 1994 ), called Pr2, concerns a workshop of dimensions 3 3with 9machinesover5timeperiods.Theoptimalsolutionforthisproblem is unknown. The best solution found by the authors has a cost of 608904. By applying our algorithm to this problem (population size 150, probability of crossover 95%, probability of mutation 5%, number of iteration 1200), we find a solution with a crisp cost F thus improving the best solution known ( Conway and Venkataramanan, 1994 ). Our solution ( L 2 ) is given in Fig. 14 . 6.3. Impact of the degradation of the information on the layout
The absence of benchmarks related to the approach presented in this article has led us to develop our own set of test problems.
In the following, we will consider three workshops of dimension 3 5, 4 6 and 5 7. The numbers of machines in each workshop are, respectively, 12, 20 and 30. The number of periods is 4. In order to study the consequences of the degradation of informa-tion data on the layout design, we propose to compare layouts designed in a crisp context (noted L c ) with one designed in an uncertain environment (noted L f ). For this purpose, in a first stage, let us address the layout problems with crisp demands of product.
At each period t , crisp flows f pl ijt , between machines i and j , are generated randomly in the interval [10, 100] (the data for each problem are hosted on https://sites.google.com/site/paper data2011/ ). Our evolutionary algorithm is used with the para-meters that are given in Table 2 . The convergence of the algorithm is shown for each case in Fig. 15 . The best layouts ( L c 10 runs of the genetic algorithm are given in Fig. 16 , Fig. 17 and Fig. 18 and their corresponding costs are given in Table 3 .
In a second stage, we introduce uncertainties, by rendering the information about flows between machines more and more uncer-tain along time. Flows ~ f ijt between machines i and j for each period t become fuzzy. To characterize the growing uncertainty of the production data, the spreads of each ~ f ijt is increased for each production period. The fuzzification of the flows ~ f ijt is made as follows:  X  f min ijt is randomly generated in the interval f pl ijt  X  f max ijt is randomly generated in the interval f pl ijt where d t corresponds to the fuzzification degree of the flow and f is the precise flow between machines used in the crisp problems are available in https://sites.google.com/site/paperdata2011/ .The for these problems are given in Table 4 . Illustrations of different layouts are given in Fig. 19 , Fig. 20 and Fig. 21 .

We can see that when uncertainty is taken into account, we may not find any more the same best solution. For the workshop of dimensions 3 5, we can notice that layouts found for the first 2 periods, when the degradation of the information is 10% and 25%, are the same for the crisp and the uncertain environments. The same observation is true for the first period of the 4 6 layout. This shows that when, the degradation of the information is not important, a layout found using a crisp approach, can remain good, until a too important level of degradation is achieved. However the introduction of uncertainty is likely to render a given layout less efficient.

Another way of compare the efficiency of layouts found in crisp and uncertain environment, with degradation of the quality of available information, is to  X  X imulate X  production data over four time periods and apply them successively to the layouts L found previously. In other words, we advance time and assume 21 18 9 10 21 18 9 25 three scenarios corresponding to three random production requests over the four periods. The flows f ijt between machines i and j for each period t are generated randomly in  X  f min ( https://sites.google.com/site/paperdata2011/ ). The data provided are applied successively to L c and L f . Table 5 gives various costs F and F f , corresponding , respectively, to layouts L c and L f and the percentage gap between these two values (%  X  ( F f F c )/ F
For all layout sizes, F f is smaller than F c : about 7% for the workshop of size 3 5, 10% for the workshop of size 4 6 and 13% for the workshop of size 5 7. It appears that taking into account the degradation of the quality of information about production data renders the layout most robust and less sensitive to the changes that are, in a certain manner, better anticipated.
Moreover, for all the workshops, certain machines remain adjacent even when the uncertainty increases. For example, for the workshop of dimensions 5 7, the machine 12 is adjacent to machines 13 and 5 over all study periods. This indication may be useful to the decision maker, who will keep the position of these subsets of adjacent machines when defining a robust layout. 7. Conclusion
When dealing with realistic layout problems, the assumption that the required data is precisely known and available cannot generally be accepted. We have underlined that in most cases, we know much more about the production to be carried out in the near future than in a far future. Meanwhile, layouts are generally designed for the long term. Indeed, moving the machines in a workshop is generally a very costly task, so that the layout chosen must be robust and must remain efficient, although changes occur in the production demand. To take such an important issue into consideration, we have introduced the idea of degradation of the available information about production demand, and have con-sidered that the uncertainty about what will be produced increases over time.

We have formulated the problem as a fuzzy optimization on several time periods. Fuzzy numbers that characterize each produc-tion period have an increasing spread to characterize the growing uncertainty of the demand. We have suggested an evolutionary algorithm. The experiments made have shown that it can perform quite well for problem with crisp data. When uncertainty is taken into account we have seen that the degradation of the available information can strongly impact the layout found, so that this important feature should be taken into account when a robust layout is needed.
 Several research directions can be drawn from this research.
The cross over and mutations operators can probably improved to yield to better performances and other types of metaheuristics could also be used to address this problem using the principles introduced in the article. Fuzziness issues could also be handled using different comparisons methods. With the view of being more realistic again, more complex layout problems, where the decision maker expresses preferences and constraints about the position of machines should be addressed. We are also interested in taking into account other type of fuzzy data, such as the operating times or the characteristics of new products. Consider-ing fuzzy rolling horizons is also contemplated.
