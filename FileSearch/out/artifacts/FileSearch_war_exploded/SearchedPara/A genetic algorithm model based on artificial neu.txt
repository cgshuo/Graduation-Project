 1. Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the leading tumor-related causes of death in women ( He et al., 2009 ). If cancer cells are present in
Axillary Lymph Nodes (ALN), a risk for metastatic breast cancer rises. ALN may be removed by different types of lymph node dissection surgeries such as Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) and Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND). Research shows that more surgery operations may be necessary and cause some adverse events such as lymphoedema, restriction of arm and shoulder movement and numbness of upper arm skin ( Karakis et al., 2011 ). If ALN status of breast cancer patients could be accurately predicted from basic clinical and histological features, surgical operations could be prevented ( Patani et al., 2007 ; Karakis et al., 2011 ).

Previous researches use the statistical methods such as logistic regression, univariate and multivariate analysis in this area. It is showed that no single feature or combinations of features are sufficiently accurate to predict axillary status ( Patani et al., 2007 ).
For example, Harden et al. found that lymphvascular invasion and tumor size could be determined but tumor grade was not associated with ALN status ( Harden et al., 2001 ). However,
Farshid et al. did not find significance of tumor size and grade ( Farshid et al., 2004 ). Hence, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been proposed as a supplement or alternative to standard statistical techniques for prediction of axillary lymph node status in breast cancer patients ( Tez et al., 2007 ; Karakis et al., 2011 ). intelligence that have been successfully applied to a variety of problems including pattern recognition, modeling, control and medical field ( Papik et al., 1998 ; Haykin, 1999 , 2000 ; Lisboaa and Taktak, 2006 ; Marchevsky, 2006 ; Paliwal and Kumar, 2009 ;
Ferreira and Gil, 2012 ). However, there is a few artificial neural network studies in ALN status prediction ( Naguib et al., 1996 ;
Marchevsky et al., 1999 ; Seker et al., 2000 , 2002 , 2003 ; Mattfeldt et al., 2004 ; Lancashire et al., 2008 ; Karakis et al., 2011 ). In this field, the most striking results have been obtained by Marchevsky et al. (1999) and Lancashire et al. (2008) .

Marchevsky et al. (1999) evaluated 19 prognostic features of 279 patients through probabilistic Neural Networks (NNs) based on genetic algorithms and logistic regression classifiers.
Lancashire et al. (2008) applied the MLP to a gene microarray dataset that consists of 49 samples to identify gene signatures corresponding with estrogen receptor and ALN status in breast cancer. The high predictive accuracy values were obtained 89% and 100% respectively in these studies. However, the used gene protein data or flow-cytometric data are difficult to obtain in each hospital. Mattfeldt et al. (2004) used the histological (the age, tumor type, grade and size, skin infiltration, lymphangiosis carcinomatosa, pT4 category) and flow-cytometric (percentage of tumor cells in G2/M-and S-phases of the cell cycle, and ploidy index) features to predict ALN status. It also stated that basic features could be used as determiners. Nonetheless, the predictive accuracy of performed model was only 72%.

Previous study classified axillary lymph node status of 270 breast cancer patients through pattern recognition techniques such as MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) ( Karakis et al., 2011 ). MLP network structure that use Levenberg X 
Marquardt algorithm in back propagation training was consisted of a hidden layer with 4 neurons. MLP classifier found the correlation coefficient and the accuracy value of testing dataset as 0.872 and 94.4% respectively. However, none of the classifiers have the high accuracy value as features are selected randomly. Because, a general problem in MLP model selection is to obtain right parameters that fit a model with observed data. Hence, feature selection can be described as an optimization problem. The data without any feature selection might be redundant and may deteriorate. It also influ-ences the efficiency of classification. Feature selection reduces computational cost, storage requirements, and training time. It also facilitates Back Propagation (BP) training process ( Castillo et al., 2000 ; Lin et al., 2008 ).
 Feature selection approaches can be categorized in two models.
The filter model is based on statistical approaches and it is also quite fast technique. Nonetheless, the resulting feature subset may not be the best. The wrapper model uses some selection methods to choose feature subsets. It evaluates the result by means of the accuracy rates of classification algorithm calculates the accuracy rates. The wrapper model is widely used feature selection with Genetic Algorithm (GA) approaches in MLP ( Lin et al., 2008 ). GA has been used with neural network to search for input features or to determine the number of nodes or connections in the network ( Handels et al., 1999 , Arifovica and Gencay, 2001 ; Palmes et al., 2005 ; Nicola setal.,2006 ; Ambrogi et al., 2007 ; Benardos and Vosniakos (2007) ).

This study has used only basic clinical and histological features of breast cancer patients. The data have been obtained from Ankara Numune Educational and Research Hospital and Ankara Oncology
Educational and Research Hospital. The aims of our analysis are to identify potential feature(s) of ALN status and propose a classifier modelbymeansofMLP,LRandGAbasedMLP.

The rest of this study is organized as follows. After the first section, material and method are described in Section 2 . Section 3 presents results of developed models. It also includes a brief discussion of the obtained results. Finally Section 4 states the conclusion and future works. 2. Material and method 2.1. Dataset
The diagnosis of the breast cancer is based on the clinical, radiological, and pathological examinations. In clinical examination, patients X  features including age, family health history, menstrual history, pregnancy age, previous breast illness history are gathered. Manual palpation of the breasts is examined by the expert doctor. If there is any suspected mass, radiological examination such as mammography, ultrasound is used. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the breasts is not a routine procedure. Conclusive diagnosis of breast cancer is examined biopsy (fine needle aspiration biopsy, core needle biopsy etc.). The World Health Organization (WHO) classification and the Tumor-Node-Metastases (TNM) staging sys-tem are used in pathological diagnosis ( Patani et al., 2007 ; Kataja and Castiglione, 2009 ; Karakis et al., 2011 ).

In this study, clinical (numerical age-F1, categorical age-F2, menopause status-F3), radiological (tumor size-F4, tumor type-F5, tumor location-F6) and pathological features (T staging-F7, tumor grade-F8, lymphatic invasion-F9) are examined to deter-mine of axillary lymph node status in breast cancer patients. They are encoded into numeric values given in Table 1 .

The dataset consists of 270 samples of breast cancer patients who underwent modified radical mastectomy at Ankara Numune Educational and Research Hospital, and Ankara Oncology Educa-tional and Research Hospital. 59% of patients have positive ALN. The dataset is divided into 80% training set and 20% testing set respectively. Matlab Neural Network Toolbox TM 6.0 and SPSS 13.0 statistical software are used for analysis. 2.2. Methods
This study proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm based approach, denoted as NeuralGenetic, to determine features as inputs and weights of backpropagation algorithm in MLP architectures. Neur-alGenetic, LR and MLP models are compared through accuracy rates of testing dataset. The proposed classification model is shown in Fig. 1 .

The analyses consist of two phases. Initially, LR analysis per-forms to generate a second limited training and testing dataset to determine important features. Secondly, NeuralGenetic was used for feature selection and optimization of MLP architectures. It also improves the accuracy of MLP models. The comparison results of models are evaluated with regression and Receiver Operating
Characteristics (ROC) statistical methods such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Area Under of Curve (AUC). 2.2.1. Logistic Regression (LR)
Logistic Regression (LR) is a type of predictive model that can be used when the target variable is a categorical variable with two categories. It can be used to predict a dependent variable on the basis of continuous and/or categorical independents and to determine the percent of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independents. The impact of predictor variables is usually explained in terms of odds ratios. Logistic function can be expressed with Eq. (1) . p x  X  X  X  where b o and b 1 are coefficient of independents variables in Eq. (1) ( Garson, 1998 ).

LR is preferred since the data set consists of continuous and/or categorical features. It also responses feature have only two categories ( Garson, 1998 , Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000 ). Accord-ing to Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000) , Pearson coefficient and significance level of Wald can be determined as 0.15 or 0.25.
However, if large p -value is selected, the index model may not fit well. Therefore, p -value is set to 0.15. The accuracy of the LR model is evaluated by testing dataset. 2.2.2. Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)
MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) is commonly used to diagnose in medicine by reason of the ability to learn and generalize, smaller training set requirements, fast operations and ease of implementa-tion ( Lisboaa et al., 2006 ; Marchevsky et al., 2006 ). It consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers and output layer. At each layer, the inputs from the previous layer are multiplied by the activation synaptic weights, summed and transformed by the activation function. The results from the individual nodes are then sent to the next hidden layer or output layer ( Haykin, 2000 ).
Backpropagation is the most widely used algorithm for supervised learning. It repeats the influence of each weight in the network with respect to an arbitrary error-function ( e ). It is presented in Eq. (2) . e  X  n  X  X  d j  X  n  X  y j  X  n  X  X  2  X  where d j  X  n  X  is desired output and y j  X  n  X  is network output in Eq. (2) ( Haykin, 1999 ; Karakis et al., 2011 ).
 the each network output unit is calculated together with the error of each hidden unit. The gradient value with respect to error is computed for this sample. The weights are updated in accordance with Eq. (3) .
 D w ji  X  n  X  X  Z d j  X  n  X  y i  X  n  X  X  3  X  same training samples until the network performs an acceptable level ( Karakis et al., 2011 ). In this study, Levenberg X  X arquardt back propagation learning algorithm is selected by reason of fast learning algorithm. It updates the weights and bias of MLP network by using a square Jacobian smoothing. It is expressed in Eq. (4) . wn  X  1  X  X  X  w  X  n  X  X  H  X  1 J T  X  n  X  e  X  n  X  X  4  X  where H is a Hessian matrix ( H  X  n  X  X  J T  X  n  X  J  X  n  X  X  matrix in Eq. (4) ( Karakis et al., 2011 ; Mukherjee and Routroy, 2012 ). 2.3. Proposed method based on Genetic Algorithm evolution. It is a heuristic methods for solving computationally difficult problems ( Huming et al., 2006 ). GA has an advantage over many traditional heuristic methods when search spaces are highly modal, discontinuous, or constrained. In this study, GA is used for feature selection and optimizing the parameters of MLP network. The flowchart of GA based MLP is shown in Fig. 2 . 1. NeuralGenetic method is specified in the following pseudo-2. Repeat reproduction process up to generate k generations: 3. Use the best individual to obtain the testing set.
 binary or real numbers. It is shown in Fig. 3 . Binary genome expresses whether select feature or not and real genome is used to indicate the value of MLP connection weights. The population is initialized randomly with generated chromosomes. Population size ( P ) and generation size ( G ) are examined by trial and error.
They are set to 40 and 100 with respectively on the interval [10 200].
 fitness function is a used-defined function which returns the evaluation results of each chromosome ( Huming et al., 2006 ).
In this study, the fitness function is correlation coefficient of testing set. It is calculated after the training process of MLP network finishes ( Wikipedia, Regression Analysis, 2012 ). Chromo-somes of population are sorted to their fitness values. Reproduc-tion is performed with crossover, mutation and elitism operators. The used fitness function is presented in Eq. (5) .
 F  X  P x x  X  X  y y  X  X 
P x x  X  X  2 y y  X  X  2  X  5  X  where x is desired output and y is network output of testing dataset in Eq. (5) .

During each successive generation, a new generation is bred from the existing population through a selection method. Tourna-ment selection is used to increase selection chance of weak individuals. The winner of each tournament is selected for cross-over ( Wikipedia, Crossover, 2012 ). Chromosomes are swapped according to determining single crossover point both binary and real genomes. Crossover probability is selected as 0.2 on the interval [0.1 0.9].

Mutation operator generates a value which randomly changes binary genome ( Weise, 2009 ). If binary gene is selected as 1, the values of each real genes linked this binary gene are adding a value randomly. Elitism operator is used to insert the n best individuals into successive population next generation. In this study, mutation probability and elitism probability are set to 0.05 and 0.03 respectively on the interval [0.01 0.09]. The fitness values of MLP models are cross-correlated with 10 fold in GA. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Logistic regression analysis Results The performance of LR classifier is evaluated by Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square test. It is considered valid since significance levels of models are greater than 0.05. The other details are expressed in Section 2.2.1 . Table 2 shows features in the model with respect to forward stepwise LR analysis. Categorical age (F2), menopause status (F3), tumor grade (F8) and lymphatic invasion (F9) are found to be significant as independent predictor features since their Pearson coefficients and significance levels were between 0 and 0.15. Limited training and testing dataset are also created with these significance features. The developed LR model are applied to full and limited dataset. However, second limited dataset with these categorical features has only 34 samples. The results are shown in Table 3 . The specificity and accuracy rates of LR model with full testing dataset are found as 86.1% and 74.1% with respectively. 3.2. GA based MLP model results
In this section, the results of GA analysis and the selection of classifier are discussed for ALN prediction. In previous study, MLP classifier has high correlation coefficient than other classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Linear Discmininant Analysis, k-Nearest Neighbor. It is found as 0.872 ( Karakis et al., 2011 ). Hence, MLP classifier is used in GA. The architecture of the neural network is developed by trial and error. One hidden layer is used and hidden layer neurons is set to as 4 on the interval [1 9]. Weights and bias values are initialized randomly on the interval [-1 1]. Learning rate parameter is set to 0.01 on the interval [0.01 0.09]. Hyperbolic tangent is selected as an activation function in layers neurons. ANN X  X  inputs described above are normalized on the interval [ 1 1]. Sequential training mode of backpropagation learning is preferred because it is simple and provides effective solutions to large and difficult problems. Mean Square Error (MSE) is used to update network model weights and biases. Each trained network is tested by testing dataset by means of its correlation coefficient. All the neural network X  X  architectures are performed with using 10-fold cross correlation.

The analyses of GA parameters such as population, generation size, mutation, elitism and crossover probabilities are performed by trial and error. These values and GA model X  X  details are mentioned in Section 2.3 . In GA generation analyses, the best 100 MLP networks are obtained. They have different features and

Fig. 4 shows the ratio of features that are existed in the subset of best features. It can be seen clearly from Fig. 4 that tumor location (F6) and tumor grade (F8) features are rare in features subset. Ages (F1), menopause status (F3), tumor size (F4) and lymphatic invasion (F9) are exactly existed in all features subset. Similarly, menopause status (F3) and lymphatic invasion (F9) are both found to be significant for ALN status in LR model.
In the literature, these features are indicated to may be effective for determining ALN status ( Patani et al., 2007 ). However, the correlation coefficient X  averages of MLP networks are between % 85 and as %87 in testing dataset. The result of feature subsets by means of the highest fitness values is shown in Fig. 5 .
Table 4 shows correlation coefficient and ROC values of testing dataset in GA based MLP classifier. These values are effected positively from the increment of the input features numbers in
MLP. The highest correlation coefficient of MLP classifier is obtained as 0.959. The best subset consists of nine features in
Table 4 . The sensitivity, specificity and AUC values of MLP classifier are found as 98.743%, 96.565% and 0.98 respectively.
It can be seen clearly from Table 4 that NeuralGenetic (GA  X  MLP) has the highest accuracy values for determining ALN status as 98.478%. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the effects of basic features where collect in every hospital for determining ALN status.
 literature. Marchevsky et al. (1999) and Lancashire et al. (2008) similarly propose MLP classifiers. The accuracy values are obtained as 89% and 100% with respectively. However, these features are not collect in every hospital. Seker et al. (2003) and Mattfeldt et al. (2004) classify ALN status with 3 features. Nonetheless, the accu-racy values of models are only found as 73%. In previous study, the correlation coefficient and accuracy value of MLP are found as 0.872 and 94% respectively ( Karakis et al., 2011 ). It is concluded that GA based MLP(NeuralGenetic) develops the accuracy of MLP classifier.
It also shows that basic features can be use for determining ALN status. 4. Conclusions stage, prognosis and treatment of breast cancer. Surgical opera-tions which may be necessary and cause some adverse effects are performed in determination ALN status. For this reason, the effects of 270 breast cancer patients X  basic potential features have examined to determine a classifier model for ALN status. The classifier is selected through MLP, GA based MLP and LR models. such as numerical age, categorical age, menopause status, tumor size, tumor type, tumor location, T staging, tumor grade and lymphatic invasion obtain the best result in literature studies except Lancashire et al. (2008) . The main aim of our study is to identify the effects of basic clinical and histological features which can be easily collected in every hospital for ALN status. In the literature, some studies about ALN status have used the features which cannot be obtained easily in each hospital ( Naguib et al., 1996 ; Marchevsky et al., 1999 ; Seker et al., 2000 , 2002 , 2003 ;
Lancashire et al., 2008 ).Theothersareunabletoperformahigh predictive accuracy ( Naguib et al., 1996 ; Marchevsky et al., 1999 ;
Seker et al., 2000 , 2002 , 2003 ; Mattfeldt et al., 2004 ; Karakis et al., 2011 ). In this study, the accuracy value of GA based MLP is found as 0.98 with using basic nine features. In addition to, menopause status, and lymphatic invasion are determined to be significant as a predictor features with respect to the result of both LR and GA as shown the details in Fig. 4 and Table 2 . We believe that GA based
MLP classifier can be used for making decision axillary lymph node status of breast cancer patients. Consequently, surgical operations may not require.

In the future, proposed GA based MLP classifier (NeuralGe-netic) should be tested with additional data of breast cancer. For this reason, software has developed for using in the Department of General Surgery of Ankara Numune Educational and Research
Hospital. Thus, MLP model will be generalized with different obtained data.
