Uncertainty may exists becaus e the data was extracted automatically from text, or was derived from the physical world such as RFID data, or was obtained by integrating several data sets using fuzzy matches, or may be the result of complex stochastic models. In a probabilistic database uncertainty is modeled using probabilities, and data management techniques are extended to cope with probabilistic data.
 gree of uncertainty is the probability that its lineage formula is true. Thus, query evaluation reduces to the problem of computing the probability of a Boolean formula. This problem generalizes mode l counting, which has been extensively studied in the AI and model checking literature. Today X  X  state of the art methods for computing the exact probability are extensions of Davis Putnam X  X  (DP) pro-cedure [3, 2, 1, 4]. In probabilistic databases we can take a new approach, because here we can fix the query, and consider only the database as variable input (called data complexity [7]). An interesting dichotomy theorem holds: for every query, either its complexity is in PTIME or is #P-hard. A new probabilistic inference algorithm was needed in order to compute all PTIME queries, which uses the inclusion/exclusion principle [6]. This technique is missing from today X  X  exten-sions of DP, yet necessary: without it one can show that probabilistic inference for certain simple PTIME queries requires exponential time [5].
 The promise of data-driven decision-making is now being recognized broadly, and there is growing enthusiasm for the notion of  X  X ig Data.  X  O  X  OThisistrue of Big Data in the enterprise, but this is even more true of Big Data on the web. While the promise of Big Data is real  X  for example, it is estimated that Google alone contributed 54 billion do llars to the US economy in 2009  X  there is currently a wide gap between its potential and its realization.
 Data impede progress at all phases of the pipeline that can create value from data. The problems start right away during data acquisition, when the data tsunami requires us to make decisions, currently in an ad hoc manner, about what data to keep and what to discard, and how to store what we keep reliably with the right metadata. Much data today is not natively in structured format; for exam-ple, tweets and blogs are weakly structure d pieces of text, while images and video are structured for storage and display, but not for semantic content and search: transforming such content into a structured format for later analysis is a major challenge. The value of data explodes wh en it can be linked with other data, thus data integration is a major creator of value. Since most data is directly generated in digital format today, we have the opportunity and the challenge both to influ-ence the creation to facilitate later linkage and to automatically link previously created data. Data analysis, organization, retrieval, and modeling are other foun-dational challenges. Finally, presentation of the results and its interpretation by non-technical domain experts is crucial to extracting actionable knowledge. In this talk, drawing upon this white paper, I will present these challenges, particularly as they relate to the web. I will draw upon examples from database usability to show how size and complexity of Big Data can create difficulties for a user, and mention some directions of work in this regard. In particular, I will highlight how Big Data issues arise in surprising contexts, such as in browsing[SIGMOD12].
 Abstract. This year, (2013) marks the 20th anniversary of the first public web search engine JumpStation launched in late 1993. For those who were around in those early days, it was becoming clear that an information provision and an information access revolut ion was on its way; though very few, if any would have predicted the state of the information society we have today. It is perhaps worth reflecting on what has been achieved in th e field of information retrieval since these systems were first created, and consider what remains to be accomplished. It is perhaps easy to see the success of systems like Google and ask what else is there to achieve? However, in some ways, Google has it easy. In this talk, I will explain why Web search can be viewed as a relatively easy task and why other forms of search are much harder to perform accurately.
 The tuning carried out depends greatly on the types of queries submitted to a search engine and the types of document co llections the queries will search over. It should be possible to study the population of queries and documents and predictively configure a search engine. However, there is little understanding in either the research or practitioner c ommunities on how query and collection properties map to search engine configurations. I will present the some of the early work we have conducted at RMIT to start charting the problems in this particular space.
 users are delivered the best quality content. There is a growth in systems that recommend content based no t only on queries, but also on user context. The problem is that the quality of these systems is highly variable; one way of tackling this problem is gathering context from a wider range of places. I will present some of the possible new approaches to providing that context to search engines. Here diverse social media, and advances in lo cation technologies will be emphasized. that face the whole of the information community, namely the penetration of computer systems to virtu ally every person on the pl anet and the challenges that such an expansion presents.

 Exploratory keyword-style search has been heavily studied in the past decade, both in the context of structured [18] an d semi-structured [9] data. Given the ubiquity of massive (loosely structured) graph data in domains such as the web, social networks, biological networks, and linked open data (to name a few), there recently has been a surge of interest and advances on the problem of search in graphs (e.g., [1, 3, 12, 15, 17, 19, 20]). As graph exploration leads to deeper domain understanding, user queries begin to shift from unstructured searching to richer structure-based exploration of the graph. Consequently, there has been a flurry of language proposals specifically targeting this style of structure-aware querying in graphs (e.g., [2, 3, 5, 13, 16]).

In this tutorial, we survey this growing body of work, with an eye towards both bringing participants up to speed in this field of rapid progress and delim-iting the boundaries of the state-of-the-art. A particular focus will be on recent results in the theory of graph languages on the design and structural charac-terization of simple yet powerful algebraic languages for graph search, which bridge structure-oblivious and structure-aware graph exploration [4 X 6]. At the heart of these results is the methodology of coupling the expressive power of a given query language with an appropriate structural notion on data instances. Here, the idea is to characterize language equivalence of data objects in in-stances (i.e., the inability of queries in the language to distinguish the objects) purely in terms of the structure of the instance (i.e., equivalence under no-tions such as homomorphism or bisimilarity). Recently, first steps towards graph indexing have shown promise in transferring this theoretical framework into practice [7, 14]. The basic intuition behind this approach is that data should be organized to optimally reflect the type and style of queries being asked, and that the optimality of this organization can be formally established, as above. Recent results have established the practical feasibility of computing and main-taining these structural organizations on massive graphs [8, 10, 11]. The tutorial will be presented as follows: Part 1: Searching the Graph Part 2: Bridging Theory and Engineering Part 3: Indexing Graph Data  X  A Case Study Part 4: Looking Forward Yuqing Wu and George Fletcher, together with a group of collaborators in the USA, the Netherlands, and Belgium, have been conducting research in this area in recent years and have published several papers in both the theory and engi-neering branches of database research.
