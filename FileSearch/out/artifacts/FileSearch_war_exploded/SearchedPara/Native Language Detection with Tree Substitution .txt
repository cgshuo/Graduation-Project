 The correlation between a person X  X  native language (L1) and aspects of their writing in a second lan-guage (L2) can be exploited to predict L1 label given L2 text. The International Corpus of Learner En-glish (Granger et al, 2002), or ICLE, is a large set of English student essays annotated with L1 labels that allows us to bring the power of supervised ma-chine learning techniques to bear on this task. In this work we explore the possibility of automatically induced Tree Substitution Grammar (TSG) rules as features for a logistic regression model 1 trained to predict these L1 labels.

Automatic TSG induction is made difficult by the exponential number of possible TSG rules given a corpus. This is an active area of research with two distinct effective solutions. The first uses a nonpara-metric Bayesian model to handle the large number of rules (Cohn and Blunsom, 2010), while the sec-ond is inspired by tree kernel methods and extracts common subtrees from pairs of parse trees (Sangati and Zuidema, 2011). While both are effective, we show that the Bayesian method of TSG induction produces superior features and achieves a new best result at the task of native language detection. 2.1 Native Language Detection Work in automatic native language detection has been mainly associated with the ICLE, published in 2002. Koppel et al (2005) first constructed such a system with a feature set consisting of function words, POS bi-grams, and character n-grams. These features provide a strong baseline but cannot capture many linguistic phenomena.

More recently, Wong and Dras (2011a) consid-ered syntactic features for this task, using logis-tic regression with features extracted from parse trees produced by a state of the art statistical parser. They investigated two classes of features: rerank-ing features from the Charniak parser and CFG fea-tures. They showed that while reranking features capture long range dependencies in parse trees that CFG rules cannot, they do not produce classification performance superior to simple CFG rules. Their CFG feature approach represents the best perform-ing model to date for the task of native language de-tection. Wong and Dras (2011b) also investigated the use of LDA topic modeling to produce a latent feature set of reduced dimensionality, but failed to outperform baseline systems with this approach. 2.2 TSG induction One inherent difficulty in the use of TSGs is con-trolling the size of grammars automatically in-duced from data, which with any reasonable corpus quickly becomes too large for modern workstations to handle. When automatically induced TSGs were first proposed by Bod (1991), the problem of gram-mar induction was tackled with random selection of fragments or weak constraints that led to massive grammars.

A more principled technique is to use a sparse nonparametric prior, as was recently presented by Cohn et al (2009) and Post and Gildea (2009). They provide a local Gibbs sampling algorithm, and Cohn and Blunsom (2010) later developed a block sam-pling algorithm with better convergence behavior. While this Bayesian method has yet to produce state of the art parsing results, it has achieved state of the art results for unsupervised grammar induc-tion (Blunsom and Cohn, 2010) and has been ex-tended to synchronous grammars for use in sentence compression (Yamangil and Shieber, 2010).

More recently, (Sangati and Zuidema, 2011) pre-sented an elegantly simple heuristic inspired by tree kernels that they call DoubleDOP. They showed that manageable grammar sizes can be obtained from a corpus the size of the Penn Treebank by recording all fragments that occur at least twice, subject to a pairwise constraint of maximality. Using an addi-tional heuristic to provide a distribution over frag-ments, DoubleDOP achieved the current state of the art for TSG parsing, competing closely with the ab-solute best results set by refinement based parsers. 2.3 Fragment Based Classification The use of parse tree fragments for classification began with Collins and Duffy (2001). They used the number of common subtrees between two parse trees as a convolution kernel in a voted perceptron and applied it as a parse reranker. Since then, such tree kernels have been used to perform a variety of text classification tasks, such as semantic role la-beling (Moschitti et al, 2008), authorship attribu-tion (Kim et al, 2010), or the work of Suzuki and Isozaki (2006) that performs question classification, subjectivity detection, and polarity identification.
Syntactic features have also been used in non-kernelized classifiers, such as in the work of Wong and Dras (2011a) mentioned in Section 2.1. Ad-ditional examples include Raghavan et al (2010), which uses a CFG language model to perform au-thorship attribution, and Post (2011), which uses TSG features in a logistic regression model to per-form grammaticality detection. Tree Substitution Grammars are similar to Context Free Grammars, differing in that they allow rewrite rules of arbitrary parse tree structure with any num-ber of nonterminal or terminal leaves. We adopt the common term fragment 2 to refer to these rules, as they are easily visualised as fragments of a complete parse tree.
 3.1 Bayesian Induction Nonparametric Bayesian models can represent dis-tributions of unbounded size with a dynamic param-eter set that grows with the size of the training data. One method of TSG induction is to represent a prob-abilistic TSG with Dirichlet Process priors and sam-ple derivations of a corpus using MCMC.

Under this model the posterior probability of a fragment e is given as where e  X  is the multiset of fragments in the current derivations excluding e , # e is the count of the frag-ment e in e  X  , and #  X  is the total number of frag-ments in e  X  with the same root node as e . P 0 is a PCFG distribution over fragments with a bias to-wards small fragments.  X  is the concentration pa-rameter of the DP, and can be used to roughly tune the number of fragments that appear in the sampled derivations.

With this posterior distribution the derivations of a corpus can be sampled tree by tree using the block sampling algorithm of Cohn and Blunsom (2010), converging eventually on a sample from the true posterior of all derivations. 3.2 DoubleDOP Induction DoubleDOP uses a heuristic inspired by tree kernels, which are commonly used to measure similarity be-tween two parse trees by counting the number of fragments they share. DoubleDOP uses the same un-derlying technique, but caches the shared fragments instead of simply counting them. This yields a set of fragments where each member is guaranteed to appear at least twice in the training set.

In order to avoid unmanageably large grammars only maximal fragments are retained in each pair-wise extraction, which is to say that any shared frag-ment that occurs inside another shared fragment is discarded. The main disadvantage of this method is that the complexity scales quadratically with the training set size, as all pairs of sentences must be considered. It is fully parallelizable, however, which mediates this disadvantage to some extent. 4.1 Methodology Our data is drawn from the International Corpus of Learner English (Version 2), which consists of raw unsegmented English text tagged with L1 la-bels. Our experimental setup follows Wong and Dras (2011a) in analyzing Chinese, Russian, Bul-garian, Japanese, French, Czech, and Spanish L1 es-says. As in their work we randomly sample 70 train-ing and 25 test documents for each language. All re-ported results are averaged over 5 subsamplings of the full data set.

Our data preproccesing pipeline is as fol-lows: First we perform sentence segmentation with OpenNLP and then parse each sentence with a 6 split grammar for the Berkeley Parser (Petrov et al, 2006). We then replace all terminal symbols which do not occur in a list of 598 function words 3 with a single UNK terminal. This aggressive removal of lexical items is standard in this task and mitigates the effect of other unwanted information sources such as topic and geographic location that are correlated with native language in the data.

We contrast three different TSG feature sets in our experiments. First, to provide a baseline, we sim-ply read off the CFG rules from the data set (note that a CFG can be taken as a TSG with all frag-ments having depth one). Second, in the method we call BTSG, we use the Bayesian induction model with the Dirichlet process X  concentration parameters tuned to 100 and run for 1000 iterations of sampling. We take as our resulting finite grammar the frag-ments that appear in the sampled derivations. Third, we run the parameterless DoubleDOP (2DOP) in-duction method.

Using the full 2DOP feature set produces over 400k features, which heavily taxes the resources of a single modern workstation. To balance the feature set sizes between 2DOP and BTSG we pass back over the training data and count the actual number of times each fragment recovered by 2DOP appears. We then limit the list to the n most common frag-ments, where n is the average number of fragments recovered by the BTSG method (around 7k). We re-fer to results using this trimmed feature set with the label 2DOP, using 2DOP(F) to refer to DoubleDOP with the full set of features.

Given each TSG, we create a binary feature func-tion for each fragment e in the grammar such that the feature f e ( d ) is active for a document d if there ex-ists a derivation of some tree t  X  d that uses e . Clas-sification is performed with the Mallet package for logistic regression using the default initialized Max-EntTrainer. 5.1 Predictive Power The resulting classification accuracies are shown in Table 1. The BTSG feature set gives the highest per-formance, and both true TSG induction techniques outperform the CFG baseline. The CFG result represents the work of Wong and Dras (2011a), the previous best result for this task. While in their work they report 80% accuracy with the CFG model, this is for a single sampling of the full data set. We observed a large variance in clas-sification accuracy over such samplings, which in-cludes some values in their reported range but with a much lower mean. The numbers we report are from our own implementation of their CFG tech-nique, and all results are averaged over 5 random samplings from the full corpus.

For 2DOP we limit the 2DOP(F) fragments by choosing the 7k with maximum frequency, but there may exist superior methods. Indeed, Wong and Dras (2011a) claims that Information Gain is a better criteria. However, this metric requires a probabilis-tic formulation of the grammar, which 2DOP does not supply. Instead of experimenting with different limiting metrics, we note that when all 400k rules are used, the averaged accuracy is only 76.8 percent, which still lags behind BTSG. 5.2 Robustness We also investigated different classification strate-gies, as binary indicators of fragment occurrence over an entire document may lead to noisy results. Consider a single outlier sentence in a document with a single fragment that is indicative of the in-correct L1 label. Note that it is just as important in the eyes of the classifier as a fragment indicative of the correct label that appears many times. To inves-tigate this phenomena we classified individual sen-tences, and used these results to vote for each docu-ment level label in the test set.
 We employed two voting schemes. In the first, VoteOne, each sentence contributes one vote to its maximum probability label. In the second, VoteAll, the probability of each L1 label is contributed as a partial vote. Neither method increases performance for BTSG or 2DOP, but what is more interesting is that in both cases the CFG model outperforms 2DOP (with less than half of the features). The robust behavior of the BTSG method shows that it finds correctly discriminative features across several sentences in each document to a greater extent than other methods. 5.3 Concision One possible explanation for the superior perfor-mance of BTSG is that DDOP is prone to yielding multiple fragments that represent the same linguistic phenomena, leading to sets of highly correlated fea-tures. While correlated features are not crippling to a logistic regression model, they add computational complexity without contributing to higher classifica-tion accuracy.

To address this hypothesis empirically, we con-sidered pairs of fragments e A and e B and calcu-lated the pointwise mutual information (PMI) be-tween events signifying their occurrence in a sen-tence. For BTSG, the average pointwise mutual in-formation over all pairs ( e A ,e B ) is  X  . 14 , while for 2DOP it is  X  . 01 . As increasingly negative values of PMI indicate exclusivity, this supports the claim that DDOP X  X  comparative weakness is to some ex-tent due to feature redundancy. In this work we investigate automatically induced TSG fragments as classification features for native language detection. We compare Bayesian and Dou-bleDOP induced features and find that the former represents the data with less redundancy, is more ro-bust to classification strategy, and gives higher clas-sification accuracy. Additionally, the Bayesian TSG features give a new best result for the task of native language detection.
