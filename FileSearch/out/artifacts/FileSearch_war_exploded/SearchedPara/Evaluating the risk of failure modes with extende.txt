 1. Introduction
Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) was fi rst developed as a formal design methodology in the 1960s by the aerospace industry with their obvious reliability and safety requirements ( Bowles and Pel X ez, 1995 ). It has been proven to be a useful and or potential failures or problems in products, process, designs, and/or services before they reach the customer ( Stamatis, 2003 ). failure mode, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA). FMEA can be employed to improve the reliability of a system by identifying the critical potential failure modes and taking the necessary preven-tive (or corrective) actions in the redesign stage of the system.
Being an important method of preventive quality assurance, FMEA is a team-based and proactive technique. The purpose of FMEA is that require the most attention in order to assign the limited resources to the most serious risk items. Nowadays, FMEA has been extensively used to help ensure the safety and reliability of products and processes in a number of industries, including the aerospace, automotive, nuclear, mechanical and healthcare indus-press; Song et al., in press; Vinodh et al., 2012 ).

In order to take priority action for safety improvement, the risk ranking of traditional FMEA is conducted by risk priority number (RPN) which is a mathematic product of the occurrence (O), severity (S) and detection (D) of a failure mode. In mathematical form RPN  X  O S D ;  X  1  X  RPN of a failure mode, the more urgently corrective action is needed, because of the higher risk that the failure will be. Although FMEA is an effective risk analysis tool, it is by no means perfect. The crisp RPN method has been extensively criticized in Chaturvedi, 2011; Kutlu and Ekmek X io  X  lu, 2012; Liu et al., 2013b; Pillay and Wang, 2003; Seyed-Hosseini et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2009; Zhang and Chu, 2011 ), and the most important ones are as not taken into consideration, which may not be true in a practical scenario; (2) different combinations of risk factors may produce exactly the same value of RPN, but their hidden risk implications may be totally different; (3) the three risk factors are dif precisely estimated due to their subjective quanti fi cation on 1 scales; and (4) the mathematical formula for calculating RPN is debatable and lacks a complete scienti fi c basis.

To overcome the shortcomings of traditional FMEA, a number of alternative approaches have been developed in the literature, such as technique for ordering preference by similarity to ideal al., 2009a ), decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) ( Seyed-Hosseini et al., 2006 ), VIsekriterijumska opti-mizacija i KOmpromisno Resenje (VIKOR) ( Liu et al., 2012 ) and evidential reasoning approach ( Chin et al., 2009b ). The fuzzy set theory was proposed by Zadeh (1965) as a modeling tool for complex systems that are hard to de fi ne exactly in crisp numbers.
It allows coping with vague, imprecise and ambiguous input and knowledge. Thus, fuzzy set theory has been incorporated to deal with the uncertainty associated with the risk analysis problems by many researchers. For example, Zhang and Chu (2011) developed a fuzzy-RPNs-based method by integrating weighted least square method, the method of imprecision and partial ranking method to generate more accurate fuzzy RPNs and ensure to be robust against the uncertainty. Mandal and Maiti (2014) proposed the use of similarity value of fuzzy numbers and subsequent applica-tion of possibility theory approach for risk analysis using FMEA. Kutlu and Ekmek X io  X  lu (2012) considered a fuzzy approach for FMEA by applying fuzzy TOPSIS integrated with fuzzy AHP and
Song et al. (2014) proposed a failure evaluation structure based on fuzzy TOPSIS approach and comprehensive weighting method to suggested a risk priority model for prioritization of failure modes on the basis of fuzzy evidential reasoning (FER) and belief rule-based (BRB) methodology. Bowles and Pel X ez (1995) fi rst used a fuzzy if-then rule base developed from expert knowledge and expertise to describe the relationships between the risk factors and riskiness. Similar fuzzy inference methods also appeared in ( Jong et al., 2013; Kahraman et al., 2013; Pillay and Wang, 2003; fuzzy variables and proposed the use of fuzzy weighted geometric mean (FWGM) for risk evaluation and prioritization of failure modes in FMEA. In addition, a comprehensive review of the risk
In other way, FMEA is typically a group multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem involving several risk factors on which decision maker 0 s knowledge is usually vague and imprecise.
Therefore, MCDM methods are those suitable for providing ratio-
The MULTIMOORA method ( Brauers and Zavadskas, 2010 ), a recently introduced new MCDM method based on the multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis (MOORA) ( Brauers and
Zavadskas, 2006 ), may provide the basis for developing FMEA models that can effectively deal with characteristics of this problem. Due to its characteristics and capabilities, the use of
MULTIMOORA method has been increasing in the literature. For instance, Brauers et al. (2013) employed the MULTIMOORA to analyze the construction sector of the European countries from a macroeconomic point of view by comparing construction market variations appeared during the recession. Streimikiene and Balezentis (2013) proposed a MCDM methodology using the
MULTIMOORA for climate change mitigation strategies assessment and applied it for ranking of climate change mitigation policies in Lithuania. Streimikiene et al. (2012) developed a multi-criteria decision support framework based on the MULTIMOORA and
TOPSIS methods for choosing the most sustainable electricity production technologies. Brauers et al. (2012) used the MULTI-
MOORA to estimate the economic worth of the European Union (EU) member states towards 2020 and Karande and Chakraborty (2012) applied the ratio system, the reference point approach and the full multiplicative form of MOORA method to solve some of the common material selection problems. On the other hand, some researchers have updated the MULTIMOORA method with uncer-tainty treatment theories. For example, Brauers et al. (2011) modi fi ed the MULTIMOORA with triangular fuzzy number theory and used the theory of dominance to rank the EU member states according to their performance in reaching the indicator goals.
Bale  X  entis et al. (2012) extended the fuzzy MULTIMOORA for linguistic reasoning under group decision making and applied the fuzzy MULTIMOORA for group decision making (MULTI-MOORA-FG) to solve a personnel selection problem. Additionally,
Bale  X  entis and Zeng (2013) extended the MULTIMOORA method with generalized interval-valued trapezoidal fuzzy numbers for multi-criteria decision making related to uncertain assessments.
Kracka and Zavadskas (2013) proposed a technique for an effective selection of building refurbishment elements by applying MULTI-
MOORA method with interval fuzzy data. Balezentiene et al. (2013) offered a multi-criteria framework for ranking of sustainable energy crops based on fuzzy MULTIMOORA method which enables to deal with imprecise information.

De fi nition 2.1. A fuzzy set ~ A in a universe of discourse X is element x A X to a real number in the interval [0,1]. The function value  X  ~ A  X  x  X  is termed the grade of membership of x in 1965, 1975 ).

 mon used fuzzy numbers both in theory and practice. In fact, a triangular fuzzy number is a special case of a trapezoidal fuzzy number. When the two most promising values are the same number, the trapezoidal fuzzy number reduces to a triangular fuzzy number. Thus, trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are adopted for representing the linguistic variables in this study for simplifying the discussion and without loss of generality.

 X  X  1 2.2. The MULTIMOORA method
The MULTIMOORA method begins with a decision matrix X the j th criterion (objective), i  X  1 ; 2 ;:::; m and j  X  method consists of three parts: the ratio system, the reference point approach and the full multiplicative form. The former two parts were originally introduced by Brauers and Zavadskas (2006) as the multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis (MOORA). 2.2.1. The ratio system
Ratio system employs the vector data normalization by com-x the j th criterion. These normalized values are added (if desirable value of criterion is maximum) or subtracted (if desirable value is minimum). Thus, the summarizing index of each alternative is derived in this way y  X   X  g where g  X  1 ; 2 ;:::; n denotes number of criteria to be maximized and y n i is the normalized assessment of the i th alternative with respect to all criteria. Then the rank of alternatives is given 2.2.2. The reference point approach
Reference point approach is based on the ratio system. The maximal objective reference point (MORP) is found according to point can be described as r j  X  max Every coordinate of this vector represents maximum or minimum of certain criterion. Then every element of the normalized decision matrix is recalculated and fi nal rank is given according to the deviation from the reference point and the min  X  max Metric of Tchebycheff min 2.2.3. The full multiplicative form
Brauers and Zavadskas (2010) updated the MOORA by using the full multiplicative form method, which embodies maximization as well as minimization of purely multiplicative utility function. Overall utility of the i th alternative can be expressed as dimen-sionless number by the following relation: U  X  A i alternative to be maximized with g  X  1 ; 2 ;:::; n being the number of criteria to be maximized and where B i  X   X  n j  X  g  X  1 being the number of criteria to be minimized. 2.2.4. The dominance theory
Brauers and Zavadskas (2011) developed a theory of dominance to summarize the three rank lists provided by different parts of MULTIMOORA into a single one. For detailed information regar-ding the dominance theory, readers can refer to ( Brauers and
Zavadskas, 2011, 2012 ). 3. Proposed model for FMEA In this section, a systematic approach to extend the MULTI-
MOORA method is proposed to assess the risk of potential failure modes in a fuzzy environment. In this paper the importance weights of risk factors and the ratings of failure modes with or indirectly using pairwise comparisons ( Liu et al., 2013b ).
In here, it is suggested that FMEA team members use linguistic variables to evaluate the relative importance of each risk factor directly. Because linguistic assessments merely approximate the subjective judgments of decision makers, one can consider linear trapezoidal membership functions to be adequate for capturing the vagueness of these linguistic assessments ( Chen and Cheng, 2009 ). The fl ow diagram in Fig. 2 shows the proposed approach to rank the identi fi ed failure modes in the FMEA process.
Suppose there are l cross-functional members TM k  X  k  X  1
 X  in a FMEA team responsible for the assessment of m failure modes
FM i  X  i  X  1 ; 2 ;:::; m  X  with respect to n risk factors RF .

Each team member TM k is given a weight  X  k 4 0  X  k  X  1 ;
 X  matrix of the k th team member, where ~ r k ij  X  r k ij 1 fuzzy rating provided by TM k on the assessment of FM i with respect to RF j . Let ~ w k j  X  w k j 1 ; w k j 2 ; w k j 3 determination of the risk priority ranking of the identi fi modes. Based upon these assumptions or notations, the procedure of the proposed FMEA model can be summarized as the following steps: can be calculated to construct fuzzy group assessment matrix ~
R  X  X  ~ r ij  X  m n , where
Similarly, the aggregated fuzzy weight for each risk factor can be calculated as Step 5: The fuzzy ratio system.

The fuzzy ratio system de fi nes normalization of the fuzzy numbers ~ r ij resulting in normalized fuzzy assessment matrix
The normalization is performed by comparing appropriate values of fuzzy numbers ~ x r j  X 
The normalization is followed by computation of summarizing subtracted by using the following equation ~ y  X   X  g
Then each ratio is defuzzi fi ed by the centroid defuzzi fi method applying Eq. (10) and the failure modes with higher defuzzi fi ed values y i are attributed with higher ranks. Step 6: The fuzzy reference point approach.

The fuzzy maximal objective reference point (MORP) vector ~ r assessment matrix ~ X  X  X  ~ x ij m n obtained by Eq. (17) . The j th coordinate of the reference point resembles the fuzzy max-imum or minimum of the j th risk factor ~ x n j , where ~ x
The distance of each failure mode from the fuzzy MORP can be currently calculated by using Eq. (8) as d  X  max then the ranking orders of all failure modes can be determined according to the deviation from the reference point and the min  X  max Metric of Tchebycheff.
 Step 7: The fuzzy full multiplicative form.

Overall utility of the i th failure mode can be expressed as dimensionless fuzzy number by employing Eq. (6)
U i  X  ~ A i  X  ~ B i ;  X  21  X  failure mode to be minimized with g  X  1 ; 2 ;:::; n being the number of factors to be minimized and where ~ B i  X   X  n j  X  g  X  1 denotes the product of factors of the i th failure mode to be maximized with n-g being the number of factors to be max-imized. Then overall utility ~ U i is transformed into crisp values U i by using Eq. (10) to rank the failure modes. The higher the U i , the higher the rank of certain failure mode.

Step 8: Determine the fi nal ranking of all the failure modes based on the three ranking lists derived in the previous steps, referring to the dominance theory ( Brauers and Zavadskas, 2011 ).

Step 9: Analyze the results and develop recommendations to enhance the system performance. Having obtained the ranking of the failure modes, corrective actions should be taken by the relevant departments beginning with the riskiest failures.
It is worth highlighting that the fuzzy reference point approach prevents the proposed FMEA model from becoming a fully compensatory technique. The traditional FMEA de fi ning the RPN as the simple product of O , S and D is a fully compensatory method. Differing from the conventional RPN method, the fuzzy reference point approach of the proposed fuzzy FMEA is based on min-max Metric of Tchebycheff, which identi fi es certain failure Therefore, the proposed risk priority model is quite an effective in unbiased ranking of failure modes. 4. An illustrate example 4.1. Implementation
In what follows, a case study of preventing infant abduction practicality and usefulness of the proposed fuzzy FMEA approach. Infant abduction is a serious risk exposure for hospitals. Such a horri fi c event can impose monumental injury on family members, facility health care system consisting of 629 acute care beds intends to conduct an FMEA project to minimize the potential for infant abduction. After developing a fl ow chart of service process, sixteen potential failure modes were explored and listed and D ) and the calculated RPN for each failure mode are presented in Table 3 . A FMEA team of fi ve medical experts, TM k  X  has been formed to conduct the risk evaluation and to identify the most serious failure modes for taking preventive measures. The fi ve team members from different departments are assigned the analysis process because of their different domain knowledge and expertise.

The risk factors employed for prioritization of the identi failure modes are O , S and D , which can be de fi ned based on the historical data and the questionnaire answered by all FMEA team members ( Liu et al., 2011 ). Table 4 summarizes the linguistic evaluation information about the sixteen failure modes with respect to the three risk factors. Risk factors and their relative weights are expressed by using the linguistic variables given in
Tables 1 and 2 .Tobespeci fi c, the risk factors, O , S and D are expressed in a nine-point scale, whereas the relative importance of risk factors is mapped onto a seven-point scale. The fuzzy assess-ment matrix from experts will be analyzed by the means of the proposed fuzzy FMEA to identify the most important failure modes.
After translating into corresponding fuzzy numbers, the FMEA and (16) toconstructthefuzzygroupassessmentmatrix ~ R  X  X  ~ are shown in Table 5 .

Firstly, the ranking of failure modes is performed in accordance with the fuzzy ratio system. The aggregated fuzzy assessment matrix is normalized by employing Eq. (17) and the normalized the normalized data are aggregated by using Eq. (18) and defuzzi-fi ed according to Eq. (10) . The sixteen failures are then ranked in decreasing order of the crisp values as reported in Table 7 . by employing Eq. (20) for each of the failure modes identi
FMEA and the results are shown in Table 8 .Thefailuremodesare ranked in ascending order of the maximal deviations.

Thirdly, the failure modes are ranked according to the fuzzy multiplicative form as described by Eq. (21) . Given large numbers involved in the computing, Table 9 presents the summarized data only.
 three rank lists provided by different parts of fuzzy MULTIMOORA into a single fi nal rank. The last column in Table 10 presents the ingly, the risk priority ranking of failure modes is FM11

FM10 and FM4. The application of fuzzy MULTIMOORA to FMEA therefore enabled to tackle the trade-offs between multiple fail-ures and to select the most important ones for proactive inter-ventions. The obtained results in ranking of potential failure modes in the healthcare facility can provide for risk decision making support in developing corrective actions to protect against infant or child abduction. 4.2. Sensitivity analysis For example, Case 0 shows the original weights of the risk factors while the other cases show different risk factor weights for possible situations. The ranking results for the sixteen failure modes with respect to different cases are represented in Table 11 and Fig. 3 .

As one can see, FM11 is the failure mode with the top risk priority in three of the four cases. In Case 0, FM13 is the second most important failure mode where the weight of S is relatively high whereas the weights of O and D relatively low. In Case 1 and
Case 2, FM6 is at the second position since the weight of D is relatively low. As the weight of D is the highest, FM9 becomes the second most important failure mode in Case 5. The sensitivity in the real-world scenarios, determining suitable risk factor weights according to actual situations and experts' opinions is of and the following corrective actions. 4.3. Comparisons and discussion model, we used the above case study to analyze some comparable methods, which include the conventional RPN and the crisp
MULTIMOORA. Fig. 4 exhibits the ranking results of all the sixteen failure modes as obtained using these approaches. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 4 that most of the failure modes have the same rank orders in the three different FMEA approaches. The Spearman's sixteen failure modes by the proposed method and the conven-tional RPN and the crisp MULTIMOORA methods are 0.982 and fuzzy FMEA. However, there are also some differences between the ranking orders obtained by the three approaches. These incon-sistent ranking results can be in part explained by the limitations of the conventional RPN and the crisp MULTIMOORA. For example, both FM3 and FM16 have the same RPN  X  320. And both FM7 and
FM9 have the same RPN  X  200. That is, the failure modes with different combinations of O , S and D produce the same value of RPN, leading to the dif fi cult decision making by the traditional FMEA. However, this problem can be solved easily by using the MULTIMOORA method. The results of the proposed model and the crisp MULTIMOORA show that for FM16 and FM7, more urgently corrective actions are needed. In addition, the ranking orders of
FM6, FM12, FM13 and FM14 are different from the ones produced by the crisp MULTIMOORA which are however in agreement with the ranking results of the conventional RPN. This is mainly because the imprecise and uncertain information is not considered in the conventional RPN and the crisp MULTIMOORA methods, thus causing biased ranking results.

The comparison analysis shows that a more accurate and reasonable ranking can be achieved by the application of fuzzy set theory and MULTIMOORA method to FMEA. The proposed model is superior to other methods since it has capability of representing the vague knowledge and expertise of FMEA team members. In risk evaluation problems, data are very often impre-ing such data. The fuzzy FMEA model proposed in this paper easily weigh the risk factors and to rank the identi fi ed failure modes.
Crisp methods are subsets of fuzzy models which present all possible results related to the considered problem. The presented study for prevention of infant abduction. 5. Conclusions
FMEA is a prominent proactive risk assessment technique that has been widely used in many areas and industries for safety and reliability improvement. However, the conventional RPN method has been criticized to have many de fi ciencies, such as the ones related to risk factor weights, computation of RPN and evaluation analysis techniques which can overcome the shortcomings and improve the effectiveness of the traditional FMEA. In this study we have extended and applied the MULTIMOORA method to FMEA, which encompasses value measurement as well as reference level methods. The risk factors and their relative weights were treated as fuzzy variables and evaluated in a linguistic manner rather than in precise numerical values. The new risk priority model based on fuzzy set theory and MULTIMOORA method thus provides the means for risk decision making related to uncertain assessments.
Also, a case study of preventing infant abduction was presented to demonstrate the group risk decision making procedure according to the proposed fuzzy FMEA.

Fuzzy set theory is a strong tool which can deal with the for FMEA team members to express their evaluations by using linguistic terms. Therefore, the proposed FMEA model might be suitable when conducting risk analyses which require quantitative as well as qualitative inputs. Moreover, the MULTIMOORA method was employed in order to determine the risk priority of failure modes and thus identify the high-risk failure modes. The new risk priority model can be a useful tool for determining the risk ranking of the identi fi ed failure modes in FMEA and taking preventive actions for safety and reliability improvement. Further studies might be useful to extend the proposed model by applica-tions of the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator and interval 2-tuple linguistic variables.
