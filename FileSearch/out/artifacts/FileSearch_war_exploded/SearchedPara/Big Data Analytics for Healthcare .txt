 Large amounts of heterogeneous medical data have become available in various healthcare or ganizations (payers, providers, pharmaceuticals). Those data could be an enabling resource for deriving insights for improving car e delivery and reducing waste. The enormity and complexity of these datasets present great challenges in analyses and subseque nt applications to a practical clinical environment. In this tutorial, we introduce the characteristics and related mining challenges on dealing with big medical data. Many of thos e insights come from medical informatics community, which is highly related to data mining but focuses on biomedical specifics. We survey various related papers from data mining venues as well as medical informatics venues to share with the audiences key problems and trends in healthcare analytics research, with diffe rent applications ranging from clinical text mining, predictive modeling, survival analysis, patient similarity, genetic data analysis, and public health. The tutorial will include several case st udies dealing with some of the important healthcare applications. Jimeng Sun is a research staff member at IBM TJ Watson Research Center.
