 Unconditional cash transfers to the extreme poor via mo-bile telephony represent a radical, new approach to giving. GiveDirectly is a non-governmental organization (NGO) at the vanguard of delivering this proven and e ective approach to reducing poverty. In this work, we streamline an impor-tant step in the operations of the NGO by developing and deploying a data-driven system for locating villages with ex-treme poverty in Kenya and Uganda. Using the type of roof of a home, thatched or metal, as a proxy for poverty, we de-velop a new remote sensing approach for selecting extremely poor villages to target for cash transfers. We develop an an-alytics algorithm that estimates housing quality and density in patches of publicly-available satellite imagery by learn-ing a predictive model with sieves of template matching results combined with color histograms as features. We de-velop and deploy a crowdsourcing interface to obtain labeled training data. We deploy the predictive model to construct a ne-scale heat map of poverty and integrate this discov-ered knowledge into the processes of GiveDirectly's opera-tions. Aggregating estimates at the village level, we pro-duce a ranked list from which top villages are included in GiveDirectly's planned distribution of cash transfers. The automated approach increases village selection eciency sig-ni cantly.

GiveDirectly is a non-pro t, non-governmental organiza-tion (NGO) that aims to help people living in extreme poverty by making unconditional cash transfers to them via mo-bile telephony. Unlike other charitable giving, unconditional cash transfers do not presuppose that food, livestock, or any other provisions are best for the recipients; recipients are free to spend the funds in any way they choose. Evidence from a randomized control trial shows that this method of charity has large positive e ects on multiple measures of recipients' well-being [7]. Additionally, by forgoing large in-termediary infrastructures, donations can be used extremely eciently; to date, more than 90% of each donated dollar has reached a recipient. Currently operating in Kenya and Uganda, GiveDirectly takes an end-to-end operations model and does not outsource or subcontract work to other orga-nizations.

Several steps comprise GiveDirectly's operations. First, funds are solicited from individual and institutional donors, and collected in GiveDirectly's bank account. Once a suf-cient amount has been collected, e.g. US$ 1 million, the NGO initiates a campaign to disburse the donations to the extremely poor. The rst part of a campaign is enrolling extremely poor households to be recipients; the second is transferring funds to recipients via mobile money systems such as M-Pesa [8]; and the third is conducting telephone and in-person follow-up with each recipient.

Targeting extremely poor households starts by identifying regions of the country with high poverty rates through data from the national census. Within those regions, villages and households are selected through a transparent criterion that is associated with extreme poverty. In Kenya and Uganda, where the NGO currently operates, the extremely poor tend to live in homes with thatched roofs whereas the less poor tend to live in homes with metal roofs. Villages with an abundance of low-quality housing and access to a mobile money agent are targeted.

After this selection stage, using a rigorous process of au-dits and security measures to prevent errors and fraud, money that has been transferred to GiveDirectly's local mobile money account is transferred directly to the recipient's account. text message is sent to the recipient who then goes to a mo-bile money agent|usually a shopkeeper in the village or nearby town. The recipient transfers the new funds in his or her account to the agent's account in return for cash. The
S IM cards are given to those recipients that do not have mobile phones. rec ipient is then free to use the cash for any purpose of his or her choosing.

In the current operations, the village selection phase in-volves multiple rounds of site visits with their attendant costs and logistical diculties because governmental or other poverty data does not exist at village-level granularity. In this work, we formulate, implement, and deploy data-driven approaches to streamline this part of a campaign, thereby both increasing the eciency of direct cash transfers and improving targeting of transfers to the extremely poor.
In particular, the main contribution of this work is a re-mote sensing system that estimates the quality and density of housing in large areas of central east Africa at a ne scale to facilitate village selection. Speci cally, we apply a com-bination of image processing and machine learning methods on publicly-available electro-optical satellite imagery to con-struct features for a regression that estimates the number of houses of di erent roof types in an image patch. We use tem-plate matching to nd roofs in images, and color histograms and supervised classi cation to di erentiate roof types. We take advantage of a special characteristic of roofs in this part of the world: thresholding template matching results over a sequence of values reveals di erent roof types like a sieve. Therefore, all features are calculated over a sequence of thresholds.

We develop an interactive image labeling platform and deploy it to crowdsource the acquisition of training data on roof locations and types for the supervised classi cation and regression algorithms. We nd that crowdsourcing results in rapid and high-quality completion of the labeling task, which we attribute to the intrinsic motivation of crowd members to contribute to social good. The nal learned regression func-tion allows us to construct heat maps of housing density and thatched-roof proportion from individual image patch-level estimates; areas with a preponderance of thatched-roof houses are to be targeted. From the heat maps, we aggre-gate village-level proportions of thatched roofs to produced a ranked list of villages to target.

Thus far, the data-driven prioritization of villages has been deployed in three districts in Kenya. 2 In total, the vil-lages selected through the proposed approach have received or are in the process of receiving over US$ 4 million in di-rect cash transfers. Using the data mining approach saved approximately 100 person-hours of manual work that would have been incurred in manual ways of conducting village selection. The system o ers a way to quickly scale GiveDi-rectly's operations and generate further cost savings in the future.

There is no speci c prior work in the remote sensing lit-erature on estimating the proportion of metal and thatched roofs in a village. However, two typical remote sensing prob-lems are related: land use classi cation and building extrac-tion. The most common feature for land use classi cation from single electro-optical images is color histograms as we also use [11]. Building extraction methods in the literature, including those based on the Hough transform [9], are pri-marily focused on urban and suburban environments hav-ing closely-spaced buildings with high variability in size and shape, and also sometimes attempt to reconstruct the three-dimensional geometry of the buildings. For our work, such approaches are excessve because we are concerned with the

Figure 1: Homes in central east Africa with (a) metal and (b) thatched roofs. easier rural setting with roofs all of approximately the same size and of a similar approximately rotationally-invariant shape; therefore, we can use simpler template matching ap-proaches with good performance.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec-tion 2, we further discuss the penury criterion of thatched and metal roofs. Section 3 discusses data available from satellites and previous campaigns, and the crowdsourcing we instituted to obtain further data. We present a feature construction method from satellite imagery based on tem-plate matching and use the constructed features for esti-mating the density of homes and the proportion that have thatched roofs in Section 4. Section 5 describes the deploy-ment of the estimation system in GiveDirectly's campaigns for village targeting. Finally, Section 6 presents the results and impact of the deployment to GiveDirectly and Section 7 provides a summary and suggestions for future research.
In many villages of central east Africa, the roofs of homes are typically constructed in one of two ways: they are either made of grass, i.e., are thatched, or are made of metal like tin or iron. Photographs of the two roof types are shown in Fig. 1. Metal roofs provide many bene ts over thatched roofs. For example, thatched roofs leak and collapse reg-ularly, requiring replacement one or two times a year at a cost of US$ 100 or US$ 150 per year in materials and labor, whereas metal roofs last ten to fteen years. Gut-ters to collect rain water are sometimes installed with metal roofs which lessens the incidence of waterborne diseases and reduces the labor involved with fetching water from a po-tentially large distance. Thatched roofs are also a comfort-able habitat for mosquitoes, leading to higher incidence of mosquito-borne diseases among people living under thatched roofs [5].

Households that can a ord to invest in a metal roof| which can cost as much as US$ 564 purchasing power parity in western Kenya [7]|typically do. Therefore the type of roof, thatched or metal, is a reliable proxy of the poverty level of a given area. In order to maximize operating ef-ciency and target the poorest, the NGO seeks to operate in administrative units with a high proportion of thatched roofs and low proportion of metal roofs.

In this work, we would like to quantify the proportion of thatched and metal roofs in administrative units as e-ciently as possible. Toward this end, we turn to remote sens-ing because it is possible to di erentiate roof type in satellite imagery. Leaving aside all other possible proxies for poverty, the remainder of the paper is concerned with estimating the Fi gure 2: Example of metal roof in center of satellite image. proportion of thatched roofs in administrative units and us-ing these estimates for village selection operations.
In this section, we describe various data sources available to us including their limitations and also describe a crowd-sourcing platform we deployed to obtain additional data.
Various satellites take images of the earth with di er-ing modalities (optical, hyperspectral, radar, etc.), spatial resolutions, temporal resolutions, and costs of imagery. In our application, we require the cost of obtaining imagery to be minimal, preferably zero, and the spatial resolution to be sucient so that homes occupy more than a handful of pixels. Temporal resolution is a secondary concern for us and the electro-optical modality is sucient. Under these desiderata, we choose to pull 400 400 pixel images at the highest zoom level available in this part of the world from the Google Maps API, which is made available for free. Metal and thatched roofs are distinguishable in these images, as seen in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.
 Satellite images from Google Maps are not without issue. In the part of Africa in which we are working, some small regions are obscured by clouds. An example is shown in Fig. 4(a). Since only one temporal snapshot is available per spatial location, we have no way of removing the clouds. Additionally, we have no indication on the provenance of the images, speci cally the time stamp of acquisition. In examining the images for east central Africa, it is clear that images have been taken in di erent seasons, which results in di erent visual characteristics of roofs and the other compo-nents of the scene. As shown in Fig. 4(b){(d), some images are from a wet season, some are from a dry season, and Fi gure 3: Example of thatched roof in center of satellite image. some are from a season in which there is an abundance of haze. These di erences have a direct consequence on image processing and machine learning, as we detail in Section 4. Moreover, without a time stamp, we cannot say how out-of-date our estimates may be in various small regions.
During the process of selecting individual households to receive cash transfers, GiveDirectly sends sta to villages to conduct censuses of the households there. Collected data in-cludes geographic coordinates of individual homes obtained using GPS receivers and an observation on roof type. Cen-suses include all households in a village, irrespective of roof-ing material, which may have provided excellent training data for a supervised learning algorithm had it not been for the following reason. Homes are often located at close proximity to each other; the GPS coordinates did not have enough precision and accuracy to allow us to draw a cor-respondence between homes seen in satellite images and homes recorded in censuses. Therefore, this data was not usable as a labeled training set. This same reason prevented us from using similar data from previous campaigns along with the fact that only data on actual recipients (living un-der thatched roofs) was collected in campaigns. Although not amenable to supervised learning, the census coordinates proved valuable in illuminating the geographic location of typical populated villages as we discuss in Section 3.3, where we describe a crowdsourcing application we developed to ob-tain labeled training data.

There are several levels of administrative units in Kenya, going from coarse to ne as province, district, division, loca-tion, sublocation, and village. Prioritizing at the level of the nest administrative unit, the village level in Kenya, requires us to have the geographic coordinates of the boundaries of Figure 4: Satellite images taken under di erent con-ditions: (a) cloudy, (b) wet, (c), dry, and (d) hazy. these localities. As part of previous campaigns, GiveDirectly obtained ESRI shape les of province, division, district, and sublocation boundaries in Kenya, but not village boundaries. The NGO also has PDF les of maps showing the village boundaries, but not in any georeferenced format, as seen in Fig. 5.

We had two options: work at the sublocation level only or try to georeference the PDF les. Since villages are the level at which the NGO desired to work, we set about convert-ing the PDFs into shape les. The rst step was to convert the PDF maps into a format we could open in a GIS ap-plication. Using Inkscape, an open source vector graphics editing program [1], we opened the PDF les and deleted all unnecessary features (rivers, roads, labels, etc.). We then exported the stripped-down maps as DXF les. We then opened these les in QGIS|an open source mapping application|and converted the DXF les to GEOJSON. Luckily, the PDF maps had been rendered in WGS 84, a commonly-used projection system; therefore to georeference the village-level map for each division, we wrote a simple Python script that applied a linear transformation on the coordinate system of the village-level maps to t the bounds of the division-level shape le.

At this point, we had a fairly good geographic represen-tation of villages. However, since villages are fairly small, any discrepancies between their actual location and their lo-cation in our shape les would yield innacurate results. To address this problem, we opened our transformed shape les in CartoDB, a web application for creating and editing maps [12], and manually aligned the shape les to prominent fea-tures like roads, rivers, and district boundaries. Finally, so as to ensure the interpretability of our maps, we hand-labeled each village polygon by referencing our shape les against the original PDF images. While this process was somewhat inexact, NGO sta members in Kenya were satis-ed with the results and con dent that our village polygons faithfully represented reality.
To create a collection of training data for our machine learning algorithms, we develop an interactive image label-ing platform in Python using Flask|a web development framework [4]. As shown in Fig. 6, the application serves a random satellite image to a user and allows him or her to click on roofs in the image and indicate whether they are thatched or metal. When the user is done with an image, a new, unlabeled image is served and he or she replicates the process. On the backend, we record the total number of roofs of each type in each image, as well as the pixel coordi-nates and type of each roof in each image. The platform is deployed to the web using Heroku so that people can label images in a distributed fashion.

Working with our partners at DataKind, we recruited vol-unteers to help with the labeling process. DataKind initially announced the need for volunteers via meetup.com. 3 Within an hour, more than 20 people signed up. Ultimately, 10 peo-ple were selected for the crowdsourcing process. Volunteers were trained to use the platform by telephone and via a screencast we made and posted to YouTube. 4 Once volun-teers were comfortable with the platform, we opened it up. Within one weekend, 10 users labeled all 1468 images in our training set.

While developing the platform, one of the authors of this paper labeled a random subset of 70 images. As a rough indication of the crowd's labeling quality, we nd the cor-relation coecient between the number of thatched roofs identi ed by the author and the crowd to be 0.783. Simi-larly, the correlation coecient for iron roofs is 0.698. Both quantities are quite good; manual veri cation of other im-ages also suggested that we could be highly con dent in the results.

We conjecture that the excellent response time and qual-ity are consistent with ndings by Mason and Watts [10]: \When it is possible to use non-nancial rewards, such as h ttp://www.meetup.com/DataKind-NYC/events/ 159235222/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mg-37JhAL4 harnessing intrinsic motivation, the quality of the work will be as good or better than using nancial rewards, and there-fore work can be accomplished as e ectively for little to no cost." Helping to reduce poverty in the world, like other projects for social good, provides much intrinsic motivation.
As we have discussed, the ultimate use of the data ana-lytics we are performing is in selecting administrative units with the smallest proportion of metal roofs. To achieve this objective, we pose two regression problems: estimating the total number of roofs in a 400 400 pixel satellite image and estimating the proportion of metal roofs in the same image. With both estimates, we can then obtain an aggregate pro-portion of metal roofs for any region by taking a weighted average of estimates from a tiling of image patches from that region. Let us note that accurately classifying individual roofs is not the ultimate objective because we are tackling the village selection problem.

From the crowdsourcing, we have a training set of 1468 satellite images labeled by the number of thatched roofs and the number of metal roofs, from which we can derive the total number of roofs and the fraction that are metal. These are the response variables to predict. We use random forests with 50 trees per ensemble to perform the super-vised regression because of their typical e ectiveness, speed in prediction, and ease of use [2]. We note that the fraction of metal roofs response variable takes values in the range [0 ; 1], but since all training samples fall in this range and we use random forests, the constraint does not need to be explicit in the learning. The features for the regressions are constructed from satellite image patches as we discuss next. We provide tenfold cross-validation accuracies for di erent feature choices at the end of the section.
In constructing features that relate to the number of roofs and proportion of metal roofs in an image, we rely on two concepts: color histograms and template matching. Since metal roofs, thatched roofs, and the background all have di erent color distributions, we can use counts of pixels at di erent color values as features. In particular, we quantize each of the three color channels (red, green and blue) into eight equal-width bins to obtain twenty-four color histogram features per image patch. Color histogram features have long been used in image retrieval applications [6].
We also have a fairly good idea of the size and appearance of central east African roofs, which is fairly stationary across the region, so we can apply a basic template matching ap-proach to nd individual roofs in image patches [3]. We use the sum of absolute di erences matching score on grayscale versions of image patches with two di erent templates: a 10 10 pixel white square and a 12 12 pixel template which is a central portion of an actual thatched roof from one of our satellite images. Speci cally, denoting the image patch as I and the template as T , the matching score at pixel j of the image patch is: where n is the total number of pixels in the template (100 for the white square template and 144 for the thatched roof tem-plate). An example of applying the white square template to a satellite image is shown in Fig. 7. The input image is shown in Fig. 7(a) and the resulting matching score is shown in Fig. 7(b). Figure 7: Template matching steps, from (a) the input image, to the (b) matching score, to the (c) thresholded matching score, to the (d) centroids of connected components in the thresholded matching score.

Once we have the template matching score for the image patch, we apply a threshold to obtain a binary image, as shown in Fig. 7(c) in which we can identify roofs. Based on morphological processing, we nd all of the connected components in the binary image. The number of connected compounds is equivalent to the number of roofs identi ed. The centroids of the connected components that are found are superimposed on the input image in Fig. 7(d).
Of course, the number of roofs identi ed is a function of the threshold value applied to the template matching score, as illustrated in Fig. 8. A unique characteristic of central east African roofs that is not usually apparent in general im-age processing or remote sensing applications is that chang-ing the threshold sequentially results in a sieve or ltration of roof type. When the white square template is used, as the threshold is increased, the metal roofs are revealed rst and the thatched roofs are revealed later. Finally, non-roof items are revealed. The opposite is true with the thatched roof template. Therefore, the sequence of roof counts as a function of threshold is a sieve-like feature that not only pro-vides information on the total number of roofs, but also on the proportion of metal and thatched roofs. A compound of dwellings may be identi ed as a single roof or as several roofs depending on the threshold, but according to our con-ception of the problem and our instructions to the crowd, compounds should be counted as multiple roofs.

The nal set of features we construct combines template matching with color histograms within a roof classi cation scheme. Based on the crowdsourced labeling, we not only have the counts of thatched and metal roofs in the 1468 images, but we also have the pixel locations of all of the roofs with their labels. Among the crowdsourced image set, there are 8536 roofs: 5999 thatched and 2537 metal. Taking image patches surrounding the crowdsourced clicks, we can construct color histogram features and use those to classify the roofs. Fig. 9 shows the average color histogram by roof type in wet, dry, and hazy images. From the gure, it is apparent that on average, these color histogram features are able to distinguish thatched from metal. The baseline clas-si cation accuracy is 5999/8536 = 70.28%. With a random forests classi er with 50 trees (again chosen due to typical e ectiveness, speed, and ease of use), we are able to achieve a tenfold cross-validation test accuracy of 89.67%.
To actually construct the nal set of features, we use the output of the template matching at each threshold, take a 15 15 patch centered at each roof that is found, use the random forest classi er on color histogram features calcu-lated on those patches, and compute the classi cation score output by the random forests (average vote among all con-stituent decision trees) [2]. The average classi cation score among all roofs in the image at a given template matching threshold is the feature for that image at that threshold, which is a good indicator of the proportion of metal and thatched roofs in the image.

Thus overall, we have three sets of features derived from the color pixel values in a 400 400 image patch. First is the color histogram features for the entire image patch. Second is a vector of roof counts at di erent template matching thresholds for two di erent templates. Third is the average individual roof classi cation score at the same thresholds for the two templates. The feature sets are summarized in Table 1.
As mentioned at the beginning of the section, we learn re-gression functions for two di erent response variables using random forests: total roofs in an image and proportion of roofs that are metal in an image using the three sets of fea-tures described above. We examine two options for dealing with the di erent conditions during satellite image acqui-sition: learning a single estimator for all conditions, and learning separate estimators for the di erent conditions.
The gure of merit we use is mean absolute error (MAE) because of its easier interpretability than root mean squared error. However, we should note that MAE at the satellite image level is not the ultimate metric of interest. Since we ultimately average together estimates from all images in a village (which should reduce the error assuming that the image-level estimates are close to unbiased), and then rank the villages, the ultimate metrics of interest are MAE at the village level and especially rank correlation at the village level. However, we unfortunately have no ground truth for these quantities to report accuracy against.

Table 2 presents tenfold cross-validation testing error for di erent sets of features used and the two approaches for dealing with di ering satellite conditions. As a point of com-parison, if we use the mean value of the training response variables as the estimates for all test samples, the baseline MAEs are 2.8392 for total roofs and 0.2121 for the propor-tion of roofs that are metal. In examining the table, we see that separate regressions for the di erent conditions are better than a single regression across the board. Among the di erent options for feature sets, the combination of all fea-tures yields the best performance in predicting the propor-tion of metal roofs, with mean absolute error 0.1621. The average roof classi cation score feature set does not help in predicting the total number of roofs, which is expected b ecause by averaging together the classi cation scores, we lose all information about the total number of roofs. The best performance is achieved by the combination of color histograms features and template matching roof count fea-tures with mean absolute error 1.9511. As we see in the next section, these error values are suciently small for our application and deployment; we use these feature sets going forward.
Having learned regression functions as described in Sec-tion 4, we now describe how we deploy the image processing and machine learning algorithm as part of the NGO's opera-tions work ow. Based on previous experience and national-level data, GiveDirectly already identi ed which districts and divisions it is considering operating in. The question to answer is which villages within those divisions to target.
For any new 400 400 pixel image that was not seen by the predictive model during training, we can calculate its features and estimate the total number of roofs and the pro-portion metal using the learned model. The di erent satel-lite conditions in images persist over fairly large contiguous regions, so it is a quick and straightforward exercise to de-ne bounding boxes corresponding to wet, dry, and hazy conditions, and use the appropriate regression function.
One may ask why we do not crowdsource the entire label-ing e ort instead of using the crowd only to provide training data for a machine learning algorithm. Our initial deploy-ment scored approximately thirty times as many images as in the training set and future deployments may have hun-dreds of times as many images. Therefore relying on the crowd for the entire labeling task is not scalable, especially because we require consistency in the labels to allow com-parisons between villages.

We download satellite images from the Google Maps API that tile the entire region of interest (and could do so for all of Kenya and Uganda if desired). We use equally-spaced latitudes and longitudes to do so since the API is called using latitude and longitude inputs. Since our region of interest straddles the equator, equally-spaced longitudes are an extremely close approximation to equally-spaced ground locations. We estimate the two quantities of interest for each downloaded image. We also perform a post-processing equalization step to match estimated values across satellite condition boundaries. The estimates for all image patches are visualized as heat maps, as shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11.
The northwest part of the region of interest contains clouds in the satellite images, which is re ected in both estimates. The estimated total number of roofs in these parts is very close to zero and the metal proportion is very high. A cen-tral large town in the middle of the region of interest shows up with a high roof count and high metal proportion. Lakes and reservoirs in the southwest appear as areas of low roof count and low metal proportion. A few thin horizontal and vertical lines in the heatmaps are artifacts of images con-taining a blend of satellite conditions.

The next step is to aggregate these ne-scale estimations within village boundaries. We take the average metal pro-portion weighted by total number of roofs of all image patches whose centers fall within the village boundary polygon. The resulting village-level metal roof proportions are mapped in Fig. 12. The cloud image patches do not contribute to the village-level metal proportion estimate because their total roof estimate is almost zero; the clouds do have the e ect of occluding anything beneath them, but if the occluded por-tion of a village is similar to the unoccluded portion, then the e ect is not too severe. The thin horizontal and vertical line artifacts have negligible e ect on village-level estimates.
The village-level estimates are also presented as a ranked list, as in Table 3, which shows the top twelve (obfuscated) villages for targeting. Village C14C has the highest pro-portion of thatched roofs in the region of interest and is a prime village to target. Although proportion of thatched roofs is the main criterion in village targeting, there are some logistical considerations as well, such as access to M-Pesa agents and reachability from roads. We may incorporate these other criteria into an overall village score in future it-erations of the algorithm for future campaigns, but in the initial campaigns for which the data-driven approach was applied, the rankings as in Table 3 were used as a priority list for manual selection that takes the other considerations into account.

In fact, many of the villages at the top of the list had already been enrolled in previous campaigns, providing a validation to the analytics. Additionally, several villages that constitute the main township area of this region were estimated to have high metal proportion, which is consistent Figure 9: Average color histogram by roof type in 15 15 pixel patches of training set in (a) wet, (b) dry, and (c) hazy images. latitude Fi gure 10: Heat map of number of total estimated roofs per 400 400 pixel image in the region of in-terest.

One small circularly-shaped village in the south central part of the region of interest is speci cally delineated as a separate village by government authorities precisely bacause it is a small enclave with lower poverty; the estimation results bear this out: the predicted metal proportion is much lower than the surroundings.
In early 2014, GiveDirectly piloted the algorithm to iden-tify approximately 50 villages in western Kenya for its largest campaign to date, which will move US$ 4 million in cash transfers. The approach immediately resulted in two ma-jor improvements: reduced sta time and reduced risk of inconsistent results.

Under the previous model, one sta member could collect requisite data on ve villages per day. The 507 villages that the algorithm assessed would have required 101 person days to complete manually. This represents a cost savings of ap-proximately US$ 4,000 in wages, which is equal to the value of cash transfers for four households (or twenty individuals) and improves overall operating eciency by approximately ten basis points (de ned as the fraction of total funds de-livered directly to the poor). Reducing the person-hours required also allows implementation to move more quickly by completing the assessment in a matter of minutes rather than days, which modestly increases leverage of xed costs like infrastructure and management time. These eciencies will accumulate as the algorithm is applied on an ongoing basis.

The previous model also posed a risk of inconsistent re-sults because it relied on multiple individuals, each liable to make di erent human errors. Although the historical er-ror rate is unknown, it is reasonable to conclude that the algorithm improves outcomes by introducing a consistent approach to the entire task.
In this work, we have applied data mining for social good by developing a remote sensing approach for targeting un-conditional cash transfers to the extremely poor. The al-gorithms and other system components we have developed have been deployed as decision support systems for plan-ning GiveDirectly's operations. The impact of this work in-cludes tangible bene ts for the NGO including operational eciency in cost and time, and reduction of inconsistency risk. This project also demonstrates how enthusiastic crowds can be when the goal is social good.

The machine learning and image processing components used in this work are fairly standard, but are composed in a novel way. Especially novel is the construction of sieve-like features from template matching, which was possible because of properties of thatched and metal roofs, but may nd application in other settings as well. The steps taken to develop the system, its architecture, and even the results, can be applied more generally to uplift humanity beyond just targeting for unconditional cash transfers because ne-scale estimates of poverty and other social indicators in rural villages have myriad uses.

There are several avenues for future research. First, sev-eral improvements to the algorithm are possible. In this work, each image patch estimation is treated independently; Markov random eld models connecting neighboring image patches, including thin-plate and thin-membrane priors of-ten used in remote sensing, could be used to improve the estimation results [15]. Moreover, the feature engineering can be further enhanced using techniques beyond the very basic template matching and color histograms used herein. Alternative supervised learning beyond random forests could also yield improved performance.

The rst deployment has been to prioritize villages in sup-port of a human decision maker. Additional future work in-cludes collecting data on all other considerations in village targeting and using them to fully automate the process. In this line of work, operational costs could be accounted for in the learning algorithms, cf. [14, 13], and schedules and routes for campaigns could also be constructed in a data-driven way.

One area of improvement for future campaigns relates to the fact that not all roofs seen in satellite imagery corre-spond to separate households. As discussed earlier, in this work, we count each structure within a compound sepa-rately. However, in the part of the world in which the NGO currently operates, it is common for kitchens to be separate structures and for there to be sleeping houses that depen-dent sons live in once they reach puberty, both of which should not be counted separately from the main house.
