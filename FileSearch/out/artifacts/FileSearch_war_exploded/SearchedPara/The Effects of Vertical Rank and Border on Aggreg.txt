 Aggregated search is the task of blending results from dif-ferent search services, or verticals ,intoasetofwebsearch results. Aggregated search coherence is the extent to which results from different sources focus on similar senses of an ambiguous or underspecified query. Prior work investigated the  X  X pill-over X  effect between a set of blended vertical re-sults and the web results. These studies found that users are more likely to interact with the web results when the vertical results are more consistent with the user X  X  intended query-sense. We extend this prior work by investigating three new research questions: (1) Does the spill-over effect generalize across different verticals? (2) Does the vertical rank mod-erate the level of spill-over? and (3) Does the presence of a border around the vertical results moderate the level of spill-over? We investigate four different verticals (images, news, shopping, and video) and measure spill-over using in-teraction measures associated with varying levels of engage-ment with the web results (bookmarks, clicks, scrolls, and mouseovers). Results from a large-scale crowdsourced study suggest that: (1) The spill-over effect generalizes across ver-ticals, but is stronger for some verticals than others, (2) Vertical rank has a stronger moderating effect for verticals with a mid-level of spill-over, and (3) Including a border around the vertical results has a subtle moderating effect for those verticals with a low level of spill-over.

In addition to web search, commercial search portals such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! provide access to a wide range of specialized search services or verticals . Common verticals include search engines for a specific type of media (e.g., im-ages, videos, books) or a specific type of search task (e.g., search for news, local businesses, on-line products). The goal of aggregated search is to combine results from these different systems in a single presentation. From a system perspective, aggregated search is a two-part task: (1) pre-dicting which verticals to present in response to a query ( vertical selection [4, 5, 11, 19]) and (2) predicting where to present those verticals selected ( vertical presentation [3, 23, 24]). Typically, a vertical is presented by blending a few of its top results somewhere in the first page of web results. The most confidently relevant verticals are blended higher.
In this work, we study a phenomenon called aggregated search coherence [1]. Given an ambiguous query (e.g.,  X  X at-urn X ), a common strategy for a search engine is to diversify its results (e.g., to return results about Saturn the planet, the car, and the Roman god). Aggregated search coherence is the extent to which results from different sources focus on similar query-senses. Suppose that a user issues the query  X  X aturn X  and the system decides to blend image vertical re-sults into the web results. If the web results cover multiple senses, but the images focus exclusively on the planet, then the aggregated results have a low level of coherence. Con-versely, if both sets of results cover the same query-senses, then the aggregated results have a high level of coherence.
We investigate the effect of aggregated search coherence on search behavior. Specifically, we consider whether the query-senses represented in a set of vertical results blended on the search results page (SERP) can affect user interac-tion with the web results. Prior work by Arguello and Capra studied the  X  X pill-over X  effect between images and web re-sults [1]. Results showed that users are more likely to inter-act with the web results when the blended images are more consistent with the intended query-sense. That is, a user looking for web results about  X  X aturn X  the planet is more likely to interact with the web results if the images contain pictures of the planet versus the car. In a follow-up study, Arguello and Capra investigated whether the spill-over ef-fect generalizes across verticals [2]. Results showed a strong spill-over for the images and shopping verticals, a moder-ate spill-over for the video vertical, and no spill-over for the news vertical. We build upon this prior work and explore three new research questions.
Measuring spill-over requires detecting whether the query-senses in the vertical results affect user engagement with the web results. Arguello and Capra [1, 2] operationalized user engagement with the web results in terms of clicks and book-marks. 1 While these are strong signals of user engagement, their absence does not necessarily indicate zero engagement. Thus, our first research question (RQ1) re-visits whether the spill-over effect generalizes across verticals. We inves-tigate four different verticals (images, news, shopping, and video) and, to measure engagement with the web results, we complement clicks and bookmarks with additional signals derived from browsing behavior (scrolls and mouseovers). We treat scrolls and mouseovers as evidence that the user scanned the web results and study whether the query-senses in the vertical results influence this behavior.

Our second and third research questions investigate two factors that may moderate the level of spill-over from the vertical to the web results. An important objective in ag-gregated search is to make the most confidently relevant ver-ticals more salient. One approach is to blend them higher inthewebresults.Oursecondresearchquestion(RQ2)in-vestigates whether the vertical rank moderates the level of spill-over. Prior eye-tracking studies found that users spend more time scanning results that are higher on the SERP [7, 9, 12, 15, 22]. Some of these studies also show a trust bias in favor of higher-ranked results [15, 22]. Within aggregated search, higher-ranked verticals may cause more spill-over for two reasons. First, users may be more likely to notice the vertical and thus the query-senses in the vertical results. Second, users may assume that the system is more confi-dent about the majority query-sense in the vertical results and that the web results are also skewed towards this sense.
In most commercial systems, vertical results are blended into the web results without a strong visual cue to separate them from the web results. In contrast, advertisements are often displayed using a different colored background or are enclosed in a border. Such visual cues subtly communicate to a user that the ads are separate from the web results and should be treated differently. Our third research question (RQ3) investigates whether the presence of a thin (2-pixel) gray border around the vertical results moderates the level of spill-over from the vertical to the web results. A border may reduce the level of spill-over for two reasons. First, a border may signal to a user that the vertical results are a different type of result. If the user wants web results instead, a border may influence them to skip-over the vertical and not even recognize the query-senses in the vertical results. Second, even if a user notices the query-senses in the vertical results, a border may convey that the vertical results come from a different source than the web results, which may influence the user to judge the web results independently from the vertical results. We investigate these three research questions in a large-scale crowdsourced user study.
Current methods for vertical selection and presentation do not explicitly favor coherent results. This is true in terms of the evidence used by existing algorithms to make predictions and the evaluation methods used to measure performance.
Algorithms for vertical selection and presentation use ma-chine learning to combine a wide range of features. Prior
Clicking a web result or marking it as relevant. work investigated features generated from the query string [4, 11, 23, 24], from the vertical results [3, 4, 10, 11], from the vertical query-log [3, 4, 10, 11], and from historic click-through rates on the vertical results [23, 24]. None of the features reported in the literature consider the relationship between the vertical results and those from other compo-nents on the SERP.

Evaluation methods for vertical selection and presenta-tion also ignore the effects of the vertical results on other components on the SERP. The goal of vertical selection is to make binary predictions for a set of candidate verticals. Thus, selection algorithms are evaluated using vertical rel-evance judgements and metrics such as accuracy [4, 5, 11] or precision and recall for each vertical [19]. A limitation of these metrics is that all false positive predictions are treated equally. In this study, we show that depending on the verti-cal results, displaying a non-relevant vertical can also affect user interaction with other components on the SERP.
Evaluation methods for vertical presentation fall under three categories: on-line, test-collection, and whole-page eval-uation methods. On-line methods are used to evaluate sys-tems in a live environment using implicit feedback [10, 24]. If a vertical is presented, a vertical click signals a true posi-tive prediction and a skip signals a false positive prediction. These methods suffer from the same limitation mentioned above X  X  vertical skip may deserve special treatment if it also affects user interaction with other components. Test-collection methods follow a Cranfield-style evaluation [8]. A test-collection includes a set of queries, cached results from different sources, and relevance judgements. Zhou et al. [30] proposed a utility-based evaluation metric that con-siders three distinguishing properties between verticals: (1) the vertical X  X  relevance to the task, (2) the likelihood of a user noticing the vertical results, and (3) the expected ef-fort required to assess their relevance. Our work suggests a fourth aspect to consider: the expected spill-over from the vertical results to other components on the SERP. Bailey et al. [6] proposed a whole-page evaluation method called SASI, which elicits human judgements on the whole SERP. While cross-component coherence is mentioned as an important as-pect of whole-page quality, its effect on user behavior and satisfaction was not investigated [6].

Incoherent results occur when the query is ambiguous and the different aggregated components focus on differ-ent query-senses. A natural question is: How often does this happen? Sanderson [25] conducted an analysis of a large commercial query-log and found that roughly 4% of all unique queries and 16% of all unique head queries (the most frequent) had an exact match with an ambiguous en-tity in Wikipedia and WordNet. Given an ambiguous query, incoherent results are more likely when the different back-end collections are skewed towards different senses. The analysis by Santos et al. [26] suggests that this is often the case. Santos et al. considered the different senses for a set of ambiguous entities and compared their frequencies in query-logs from a commercial web search engine and three verticals. Results showed that different sources were skewed towards different senses. For example, the shopping vertical had more queries about  X  X mazon X  the company, while the images vertical had more queries about the rainforest.
Our first research question (RQ1) investigates whether the spill-over effect generalizes across verticals. Arguello and Capra [1, 2] considered the same research question, but low the fold? (scroll), and (4) Did the participant mouseover on a web result on the initial SERP? (mouseover). These four outcome measures indicate varying levels of engagement with the web results on the initial SERP and extend prior work that considered only clicks and bookmarks [1, 2].
We manipulated four experimental variables: vertical, ver-tical query-sense, vertical rank, and vertical border. These variables controlled which vertical was blended into the ini-tial SERP and how it was displayed. Figure 2 shows four example initial SERPs.

The vertical variable determined which vertical was blend-ed into the initial SERP: images, news, shopping, or video. The images, news, and video verticals were implemented us-ing search APIs provided by Bing, and the shopping vertical was implemented using the product search API provided by eBay. For images, video, and shopping, we blended five ver-tical results horizontally, and for news, we blended three vertical results vertically. The blended vertical results were designed to look similar to commercial systems: image re-sults were displayed using thumbnails; news results were dis-played using the title, summary snippet, news source, publi-cation age, and a reduced-size rendering of an image pulled from the article; shopping results were displayed using the product name, price, condition (new, used), and a picture of the product; and video results were displayed using the title, duration, and a keyframe of the video.

The vertical query-sense variable manipulated the query-senses represented in the vertical results and had three dif-ferent values: on-target, off-target, and mixed. On target results were all consistent with the search task description, off-target results were all on a different sense, and mixed results had a combination of on-target and off-target re-sults. For example, for the search task  X  X ind information about the plot of the movie Salt. X , on-target results were all about X  X alt X  X he movie, off-target results were all about X  X alt X  the mineral, and mixed results had a combination of both. For images, shopping, and video, mixed results had two on-target and three off-target results. For the news vertical, mixed results had one on-target and two off-target results.
The vertical rank variable manipulated the position of the vertical and had two values: rank one and rank four. For rank one, the vertical was positioned directly above the first web result, and for rank four, the vertical was blended be-tween the third and fourth web results.

The vertical border variable manipulated the presence of a thin (2-pixel) gray border around the vertical results and had two values: border and no-border.
Each vertical was associated with its own unique set of 60 search tasks and each search task was associated with four components: (1) the search task description, (2) the initial query, (3) the on-target sense, and (4) the off-target sense. We used a subset of the search tasks used in Arguello and Capra [2] and the same cached web and vertical results used to construct the initial SERPs. We provide an overview of how the search tasks were constructed and refer the reader to Arguello and Capra [2] for more details.

The tasks were created as follows. First, a large set of candidate initial queries was constructed by identifying all entities with a Wikipedia disambiguation page. Second, in order to use initial queries that a user might realistically en-ter as a query, all entities not appearing as a query in the AOL query-log were filtered. The third step was to iden-tify initial queries with a strong orientation towards one of the four verticals. To this end, the remaining entities were issued to Bing and four (possibly overlapping) subsets of entities were constructed based on whether the entity trig-gered the images, news, shopping, or video vertical in the Bing results. The next step was to identify entities that re-turned multiple senses from its corresponding vertical. To accomplish this, the authors manually inspected the results from each vertical and selected 75 entities per vertical that returned multiple senses in the top-50 results. One of these senses was assigned to be the on-target sense and another was assigned to be the off-target sense. Finally, the search task description was constructed to be consistent with the on-target sense. Because the goal was to study the spill-over from the vertical to the web results, the search tasks were designed to favor web results. We randomly sampled a sub-set of 60/75 search tasks per vertical to use in our study. Table 1 shows a few example tasks.
The study was run as a remote study using Amazon X  X  Me-chanical Turk (MTurk). Each MTurk Human Intelligence Task (HIT) was associated with a single search task. Each vertical had its own unique set of 60 search tasks, and within each vertical, the study design was fully crossed. This re-sulted in 2 , 880 experimental conditions (4 verticals  X  60 search tasks per vertical  X  3 vertical query-senses  X  2ver-tical ranks  X  2 vertical border conditions = 2,880). Finally, for each experimental condition, we collected data from 10 participants, for a total of 28,880 HITs. Each HIT was priced at $0.10 USD.

Our HITs were implemented as external HITs, meaning that everything besides recruitment and compensation was managed by our own server. Hosting our HITs externally al-lowed us to capture all the necessary user interactions with the initial SERP, control the assignment of workers to ex-perimental conditions, and do quality control dynamically. All our outcome measures were derived from user interac-tions with the initial SERP (Section 3.1). Clicks were cap-tured at the server-side using URL re-directs, and scrolls and mouseovers were captured at the client-side using Javascript and transmitted to our server using AJAX.

MTurk workers were assigned to experimental conditions randomly, except for three constraints. First, participants were not allowed to see the same search task more than once. Second, vertical border was a between-subjects variable. We were concerned that varying the presence of a border as a within-subjects variable might water-down its effect, limit-ing our ability to detect differences in the two conditions. Thus, participants were assigned to a single vertical border condition. Finally, in order to collect data from a wide range of participants, workers not allowed to complete more than 100 of our HITs (less than 0 . 05% of those available). In total, we collected data from 898 participants.

MTurk studies require quality control, and we addressed this in three ways. First, we restricted our HITs to workers with a 95% acceptance rate or greater. Second, to help ensure English language proficiency, we restricited our HITs to workers in the U.S. Finally, using an external HIT design allowed us to do quality control dynamically. Prior to the
Putting these factors together, we conjecture that the im-age vertical had the strongest spill-over because it was the most visually salient (distinguishable from the web results) and required the least cognitive effort (high-quality images with no text). On the other extreme, the news vertical had the weakest spill-over because it was the least salient (less distinguishable from the web results) and required the most cognitive effort (used significantly smaller thumbnails and the most text). Shopping and video both had display char-acteristics that placed them in-between images and news in terms of salience and cognitive effort. Thus, they had spill-over effects that were in-between images and news.
Oursecondresearchquestion(RQ2)investigateswhether vertical rank moderates the level of spill-over. Our primary interest in this question was to see if displaying the vertical at rank one causes more spill-over than displaying it at rank four. In addition, we were interested in understanding the main effect of rank, regardless of query-sense.

First, we consider whether the vertical rank moderates the level of spill-over (Figures 6(a)-6(d)). As discussed pre-viously, in these figures, a spill-over is evidenced by an up-ward slope in the line as it moves from the off-target to the on-target condition (with the mixed condition in the mid-dle). An upward slope indicates more interaction with the web results when the vertical results were more on-target. A steeper slope indicates a greater level of spill-over.
Three trends are worth noting. First, rank had a small moderating effect for news and video (not significant). As shown in Figures 6(b) and 6(d), news and video had virtu-ally no spill-over at rank four (nearly flat solid lines) and a small level of spill-over at rank one (slightly upward slope for both dashed lines). Second, rank also had a small mod-erating effect for images (not significant). As shown in Fig-ure 6(a), images had a high level of spill-over at rank four (steep upward slope for solid line) and a slightly higher level of spill-over at rank one (slightly steeper upward slope for dashed line). As shown in Figure 6(c), rank had a strong and statistically significant moderating effect for shopping ( p&lt;. 05). Comparing off-versus on-target shopping results, the spill-over was about 10% at rank four (a change from 34.22% to 37.67%) and increased to about 30% at rank one (a change from 30.58% to 39.58%).

All verticals had more spill-over at rank one. However, our results suggest that rank has a stronger moderating effect for verticals with a mid-level of spill-over (e.g. shopping). In terms of RQ1, images had the strongest spill-over, and news and video had the weakest spill-over. In terms of RQ2, images had a strong spill-over irrespective of rank, and sim-ilarly, news and video had a weak spill-over irrespective of rank. Shopping appears to be at a middle point where rank can have a strong moderating effect. We see two possible explanations for this. One is that image results were highly salient and participants noticed and processed them regard-less of rank. Another explanation is that after expending effort in processing the news and video results at rank one, participants were less willing to explore further down the results (even when the news/video results were on-target).
Since only the shopping vertical had a significant inter-action effect, we were also interested in understanding the main effect of vertical rank on user interaction with the web results. The findings presented in Section 4.2 (and Figure 4) show that, in general, user interaction with the web results was lower when the vertical was presented at rank one ver-sus rank four, regardless of query-sense. This trend suggests that participants scanned the SERP from top-to-bottom and did not skip-over the vertical when it was presented at rank one. Instead, we believe that participants expanded effort on the vertical results, which resulted in less interaction with the web results. While this trend was the same for all verti-cals, it was only statistically significant for news and video. One possible explanation is that when news and video were presented at rank one, users expended more cognitive effort on them (as compared to images and shopping) and were soon-after ready to explore a different query. This is consis-tent with our explanation for why the moderating effect of vertical rank was not significant for news and video.
Our third research question (RQ3) investigates whether including a border around the vertical results moderates the level of spill-over from the vertical to the web results. Our primary interest in this question was to see if the presence of a border helps signal to users that the vertical results are separate and distinct from the web results, resulting in less spill-over. In addition, we were interested in understanding the main effect of border, regardless of query-sense.
First, we consider whether including a border around the vertical results moderates the level of spill-over (Figures 7(a)-7(d)). None of the verticals had a significant interaction ef-fect of vertical border and query-sense. However, we note several interesting trends in the data that give insights into the role that border played. First, for news and video (the ones with the least overall spill-over), border had a notice-able effect. Both verticals had virtually no spill-over in the presence of a border (indicated by the nearly flat solid lines in Figures 7(b) and 7(d)), but had a noticeable spill-over in the absence of a border (indicated by the upward trending dashed lines). Second, for shopping (mid-level of spill over), border had almost no effect (the solid and dashed lines are almost identical). Finally, for images (the one with the most overall spill-over), the border had a small, but opposite ef-fect. In this case, the presence of a border increased the level of spill-over (the slope of the solid line is more than the slope of the dashed line).

These results suggest that including a border may reduce the level of spill-over more for those verticals that are less visually salient and require more cognitive effort to process (e.g. news and video). For these verticals, the border may play a role in allowing users to identify the vertical results as a group and shift their focus to the web results.
While we found some interesting trends, the moderating effect of border was not strong enough to reach significance for any vertical. It may be that the Gestalt principle of similarity (similar items are grouped together) also played a role. Our vertical results were visually distinct from the web results and this may have influenced participants to view them as a group regardless of a border. Future work might investigate the moderating effect of border for verticals that are closer in appearance to the web results.

Since we did not find strong significant interaction effects, we also explored the main effect of border on user interaction with web results. The findings presented in Section 4.3 (and Figure 5) show that, in general, user interaction with the web results was greater when the vertical results were enclosed in a border. This effect was statistically significant ( p&lt;. for images, news, and video, and the trend was similar (but not significant) for shopping. One possible explanation is that the presence of a border helped participants to identify the vertical results as being a different type of result than the web results. The border might have allowed participants to skip-over the vertical results and focus more cognitive resources on processing the web results.
We reported on a large-scale user study that investigated whether the spill-over effect (from a set of vertical results to the web results) generalizes across verticals (RQ1), and whether the vertical rank (RQ2) and the presence of a border around the vertical results (RQ3) moderates this effect. Our results suggest three important trends. First, the spill-over effect generalizes across verticals, but is stronger for some verticals than others. Images had the strongest spill-over, followed by shopping, and then news and video. We confirm previous results that also found a stronger spill-over for im-ages and shopping [2], but also show that news and video have some level of spill-over, which can be measured us-ing interaction signals derived from scrolls and mouseovers. We conjecture that the images and shopping verticals in our study had more spill-over because they were more visually salient and required less cognitive effort to process.
Second, our results suggest that vertical rank has a stronger moderating effect for verticals with a mid-level of spill-over (e.g., shopping). In other words, verticals with a strong spill-over (e.g., images) or a weak spill-over (e.g., news and video) will have a similar level of spill-over irrespective of rank. A possible explanation is that highly salient verticals (e.g., im-ages) are more likely to be noticed at lower ranks, and that verticals that require more cognitive effort (e.g., news and video) may influence users to re-formulate the query even when the vertical results are on-target.

Finally, including a border around the vertical results has a subtle effect on those verticals with a weak level of spill-over (e.g., news and video). A possible explanation is that a border influences users to skip-over the vertical results when they are less salient and require more cognitive effort.
Our findings have important implications for aggregated search. Current approaches to aggregated search do not ex-plicitly favor coherent results. However, our research shows that the vertical results can influence user interaction with other components on the SERP. Moreover, the level of influ-ence may depend on the specific vertical, its surrogate repre-sentation, where it is displayed, and how it is distinguished in the layout from other components on the SERP. Areas for future research include developing evaluation methodologies and algorithms that model all these different factors.
