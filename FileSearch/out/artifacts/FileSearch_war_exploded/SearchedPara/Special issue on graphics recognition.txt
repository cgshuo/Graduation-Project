 PREFACE Josep Llad X s  X  Dorothea Blostein 1 Introduction Graphics Recognition is a branch of document analysis that focuses on the recovery of graphical information in documents. Graphics consist of spatial arrangements of symbols; examples include engineering drawings, maps, architectural drawings, music scores, tables, and charts. The documents may be in paper or electronic format; pen-based interfaces are used in on-line graphics recog-nition. A wide variety of Pattern Recognition and Image Processing techniques are used in Graphics Recogni-tion. Six years ago, IJDAR published a special issue on Graphics Recognition (IJDAR vol. 6(2), 2000). Now, the IAPR-TC10 (Technical Committee on Graphics Recog-nition) has promoted this new special issue, to review the evolution of the field in recent years. There have been advances in addressing the classical challenges, as well as new research interests arising from related scientific communities.

Since more than ten years ago, researchers coming from both academia and industry form an active Graph-ics Recognition community. The main forum of this com-munity is the GREC Workshop series that can be seen as the indicator that measures the evolution of the field. Throughout the six editions of GREC workshops in the last ten years, we can made some conclusions that help to sketch the future trends. The first Graphics Recognition applications can be found in the early 1980s. With the progress of digital imaging and scanning, and the advent of CAD and GIS frameworks, there was an incipient interest in converting paper drawings and maps to elec-tronic formats for storing and editing. In the beginning, the purpose was just digitization. Afterwards, geomet-ric analysis of images resulted in the first vectorization systems. New application domains were considered like architectural plans, or drawings with diagrammatic nota-tion (musical scores, flow charts, tables). Progressively the interest shifted to the semantic level, i.e., the objec-tive was to extract more complete knowledge to improve the efficiency of document management. Techniques from the Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence domains were incorporated for symbol recognition, dis-criminating text from graphics, interpreting and vali-dating diagram syntax, 3D reconstruction, etc. On the other hand, the advances in the digital pen and digital ink paradigm involved the inclusion of the user in the document lifecycle, allowing him/her to provide on-line graphic annotations by means of friendly user interfaces. The progress also allowed the processing of large sets of graphic documents stored in digital libraries for index-ing, retrieval and navigation purposes.

In this special issue, five papers are published. The first work by Wendling et al. focuses on one of the central topics of Graphics Recognition, namely, Sym-bol Recognition. In this work they present an approach based on combining shape descriptors to improve the performance of the recognition. Afterwards we present three papers covering three classical application cases of Graphics Recognition. Liu et al. present an inter-active framework for the interpretation of engineer-ing drawings. Lu et al. present a complete system to interpret architectural floor plans and render 3D views. Miyao et al. present a system to recognize musical scores. In addition, this paper covers the field of on-line hand-writing recognition. The last paper by Valveny et al. is devoted to one of the emerging topics, the evaluation of the performance of Graphics Recognition systems. In particular, they describe the benchmarking framework experimented in the last Symbol Recognition Contest held during GREC X 05 in Hong Kong. We hope that this special issue will encourage researchers to make pro-
