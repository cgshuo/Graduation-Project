Discovering them is imp ortant for inferring new knowledge and detecting new trends. D ata mining technology is giving us the ability to extract mean ingful patterns from large quantities of structured data. Collectio ns of text, however, are not as amenable to data mining. In thi s demonstration, we describe CDPRanking, a novel text mining system designed to detect interesting links and hid den information from large text corpora and expose previously unkno wn logic connections that connect facts, propositions or hyp otheses. In previous work, we have defined concept chain que ries ( CCQ ) [1], a special case of text mining in document coll ections focusing on detecting links between two concepts across text documents. Different from traditional search, we interpret a q uery involving concepts A and B as finding the best concept chain across documents that potentially connect them. For exampl e, both may be involved with educational institutions, but are mentioned in different documents. This information is only glean ed from multiple documents. The system performs this task in the following four main steps: (i) generating the Concept Association Graph ( CAG ) representing a document collection (or a subset). Concepts (nodes in the graph) are extracted by using an information extraction sy stem and associations (edges) are created based on sentence co-occurrence relationship between concepts. Each concept is asso ciated with a  X  X oncept profile X  composed of a set of its related terms. Each term in a profile is assigned a weight highlighting its importance in describing the corresponding concept. Each edge in the CAG is associated with a sentence cluster composed of sent ences in which two end nodes (concepts) co-occur. The relati onship strength between two concepts (edge weight) is dete rmined by the similarity between their respective profiles; (ii) performing concept chain queries on the CAG and retrieving the potential chains(paths) connecting query concepts; (iii) rank ing concept chains returned from (ii) when multiple connections between concepts are possible such that key terms represent ing significant relationships between concepts are ranked high; (iv ) providing explanations for each retrieved chain through linki ng text snippets extracted from multiple documents to each relevant chain. CDPRanking is designed as a stand-alone system runn ing on any PC with Microsoft .NET framework 2.0 or above. It a llows the user to import the document collection and domain s pecific dictionary. Users can easily guide the discovery pr ocess through setting appropriate parameters, such as the maximum length of desired chains and the number of top ranked chains to be returned. A graphic interface is provided and the g enerated results (concept chains) are presented in XML document form at. Relevant text snippets extracted from multiple docu ments are also presented as explanations for each retrieved chain.
