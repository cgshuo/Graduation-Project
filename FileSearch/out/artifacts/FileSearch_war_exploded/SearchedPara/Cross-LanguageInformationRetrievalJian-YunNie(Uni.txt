Cross-Language Information Retrieval is a compact book introducing a branch of infor-mation retrieval that has gained considerable research interest since the dawn of the
World Wide Web in the mid 1990s. Information retrieval is generally concerned with the problem of finding documents within a large collection that are relevant to a given input query. Whereas the original formulation of IR assumes that queries and documents are written in the same language, cross-language IR (CLIR) presumes instead that they are written in two different languages. If the collection contains documents in more languages, then we refer to multi-lingual IR (MLIR), which is typically solved with multiple instances of CLIR. Recently, other variations on the theme have been proposed that address non-textual documents, such as image, music, and speech retrieval. An interesting application of CLIR is the retrieval of images that are provided with textual descriptions in any language.
 mainly about the optimal integration of machine translation (MT) and IR, and it presents peculiar and difficult translation issues when short queries are involved, which is the most common case. For such problems, interesting approaches have been developed and refined over time, which mainly build on top of core statistical M Ttechniques (e.g., word alignment models, translation models) and various lexical resources (e.g., WordNet, dictionaries).

As specific books on CLIR have been limited so far to edited collections of scientific papers (Grefenstette 1998), it was definitely time for the first monograph on the topic.
 follows: whose understanding does not require more than elementary calculus and probability theory. However, the book does not present algorithms or data structures to implement the models, so it might not be a sufficient resource to build an effective CLIR system. approach, in which M Tor dictionary-based translation is simply cascaded with mono-lingual IR. A discussion on the limitations of using such general translation tools convinces the reader of the need for translation techniques that are more specific to and better integrated with IR. In Chapters 3 and 4, the core of the book, several advanced
CLIR models from the recent literature are discussed. In particular, Chapter 3 focuses on the collection and processing of parallel texts and on statistical translation models for query terms. Chapter 4 discusses cross-lingual counterparts of well-established IR techniques (i.e., pre-and post-translation query expansion) as well as CLIR-specific methods to further improve retrieval performance (e.g., fuzzy matching and translation combination). Finally, in Chapter 5 the author, starting from a parallel between query expansion in IR and query translation in CLEF, proposes new directions for future work. sentation and a consistent notation. It is definitely a good reference for an introduction to the field as well as for a survey of the state-of-the-art.
