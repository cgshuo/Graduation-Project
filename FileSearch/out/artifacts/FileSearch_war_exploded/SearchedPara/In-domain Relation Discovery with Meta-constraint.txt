 In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for the unsupervised learning of relations and their instan-tiations from a set of in-domain documents. Given a collection of news articles about earthquakes, for example, our method discovers relations such as the earthquake X  X  location and resulting damage, and ex-tracts phrases representing the relations X  instantia-tions. Clusters of similar in-domain documents are increasingly available in forms such as Wikipedia ar-ticle categories, financial reports, and biographies.
In contrast to previous work, our approach learns from domain-independent meta-constraints on rela-tion expression, rather than supervision specific to particular relations and their instances. In particular, we leverage the linguistic intuition that documents in a single domain exhibit regularities in how they express their relations. These regularities occur both in the relations X  lexical and syntactic realizations as well as at the level of document structure. For in-stance, consider the damage relation excerpted from earthquake articles in Figure 1. Lexically, we ob-serve similar words in the instances and their con-texts, such as  X  X estroying X  and  X  X ouses. X  Syntacti-cally, in two instances the relation instantiation is the dependency child of the word  X  X estroying. X  On the discourse level, these instances appear toward the beginning of their respective documents. In general, valid relations in many domains are characterized by these coherence properties.

We capture these regularities using a Bayesian model where the underlying relations are repre-sented as latent variables. The model takes as in-put a constituent-parsed corpus and explains how the constituents arise from the latent variables. Each re-lation instantiation is encoded by the variables as a relation-evoking indicator word ( e.g. ,  X  X estroy-ing X ) and corresponding argument constituent ( e.g. ,  X  X ome homes X ). 2 Our approach capitalizes on rela-tion regularity in two ways. First, the model X  X  gen-erative process encourages coherence in the local features and placement of relation instances. Sec-ond, we apply posterior regularization (Grac  X a et al., 2007) during inference to enforce higher-level declarative constraints, such as requiring indicators and arguments to be syntactically linked.

We evaluate our approach on two domains pre-viously studied for high-level document structure analysis, news articles about earthquakes and finan-cial markets. Our results demonstrate that we can successfully identify domain-relevant relations. We also study the importance and effectiveness of the declaratively-specified constraints. In particular, we find that a small set of declarative constraints are effective across domains, while additional domain-specific constraints yield further benefits. Extraction with Reduced Supervision Recent research in information extraction has taken large steps toward reducing the need for labeled data. Ex-amples include using bootstrapping to amplify small seed sets of example outputs (Agichtein and Gra-vano, 2000; Yangarber et al., 2000; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Zhu et al., 2009), leveraging ex-isting databases that overlap with the text (Mintz et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010), and learning gen-eral domain-independent knowledge bases by ex-ploiting redundancies in large web and news cor-pora (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Shinyama and Sekine, 2006; Banko et al., 2007; Yates and Etzioni, 2009).
Our approach is distinct in both the supervision and data we operate over. First, in contrast to boot-strapping and database matching approaches, we learn from meta-qualities, such as low variability in syntactic patterns, that characterize a good relation. We hypothesize that these properties hold across re-lations in different domains. Second, in contrast to work that builds general relation databases from het-erogeneous corpora, our focus is on learning the re-lations salient in a single domain. Our setup is more germane to specialized domains expressing informa-tion not broadly available on the web.

Earlier work in unsupervised information extrac-tion has also leveraged meta-knowledge indepen-dent of specific relation types, such as declaratively-specified syntactic patterns (Riloff, 1996), frequent dependency subtree patterns (Sudo et al., 2003), and automatic clusterings of syntactic patterns (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Zhang et al., 2005) and contexts (Chen et al., 2005; Rosenfeld and Feldman, 2007). Our ap-proach incorporates a broader range of constraints and balances constraints with underlying patterns learned from the data, thereby requiring more so-phisticated machinery for modeling and inference. Extraction with Constraints Previous work has recognized the appeal of applying declarative con-straints to extraction. In a supervised setting, Roth and Yih (2004) induce relations by using linear pro-gramming to impose global declarative constraints on the output from a set of classifiers trained on lo-cal features. Chang et al. (2007) propose an objec-tive function for semi-supervised extraction that bal-ances likelihood of labeled instances and constraint violation on unlabeled instances. Recent work has also explored how certain kinds of supervision can be formulated as constraints on model posteriors. Such constraints are not declarative, but instead based on annotations of words X  majority relation la-bels (Mann and McCallum, 2008) and pre-existing databases with the desired output schema (Bellare and McCallum, 2009). In contrast to previous work, our approach explores a different class of constraints that does not rely on supervision that is specific to particular relation types and their instances. Our work performs in-domain relation discovery by leveraging regularities in relation expression at the lexical, syntactic, and discourse levels. These regu-larities are captured via two components: a proba-bilistic model that explains how documents are gen-erated from latent relation variables and a technique for biasing inference to adhere to declaratively-specified constraints on relation expression. This section describes the generative process, while Sec-tions 4 and 5 discuss declarative constraints. 3.1 Problem Formulation Our input is a corpus of constituent-parsed docu-ments and a number K of relation types. The output is K clusters of semantically related relation instan-tiations. We represent these instantiations as a pair of indicator word and argument sequence from the same sentence. The indicator X  X  role is to anchor a relation and identify its type. We only allow nouns or verbs to be indicators. For instance, in the earth-quake domain a likely indicator for damage would be  X  X estroyed. X  The argument is the actual rela-tion value, e.g. ,  X  X ome homes, X  and corresponds to a noun phrase or adjective. 3
Along with the document parse trees, we utilize a set of features  X  i ( w ) and  X  a ( x ) describing each potential indicator word w and argument constituent x , respectively. An example feature representation is shown in Figure 2. These features can encode words, part-of-speech tags, context, and so on. Indi-cator and argument feature definitions need not be the same ( e.g. , has number is important for argu-ments but irrelevant for indicators). 4 3.2 Generative Process Our model associates each relation type k with a set of feature distributions  X  k and a location distribution  X  . Each instantiation X  X  indicator and argument, and its position within a document, are drawn from these distributions. By sharing distributions within each relation, the model places high probability mass on clusters of instantiations that are coherent in features and position. Furthermore, we allow at most one in-stantiation per document and relation, so as to target relations that are relevant to the entire document. There are three steps to the generative process. First, we draw feature and location distributions for each relation. Second, an instantiation is selected for every pair of document d and relation k . Third, the indicator features of each word and argument features of each constituent are generated based on the relation parameters and instantiations. Figure 3 presents a reference for the generative process. Generating Relation Parameters Each relation k is associated with four feature distribution param-eter vectors:  X  i k for indicator words,  X  bi k for non-indicator words,  X  a k for argument constituents, and  X  k for non-argument constituents. Each of these is a set of multinomial parameters per feature drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet prior. A likely indica-tor word should have features that are highly proba-ble according to  X  i k , and likewise for arguments and  X  . Parameters  X  bi k and  X  ba k represent background dis-tributions for non-relation words and constituents, similar in spirit to other uses of background distri-butions that filter out irrelevant words (Che, 2006). 5 By drawing each instance from these distributions, we encourage the relation to be coherent in local lex-ical and syntactic properties.

Each relation type k is also associated with a pa-rameter vector  X  k over document segments drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet prior. Documents are divided into L equal-length segments;  X  k states how likely relation k is for each segment, with one null outcome for the relation not occurring in the doc-ument. Because  X  k is shared within a relation, its instances will tend to occur in the same relative po-sitions across documents. The model can learn, for example, that a particular relation typically occurs in the first quarter of a document (if L = 4 ). Generating Relation Instantiations For every rela-tion type k and document d , we first choose which portion of the document (if any) contains the instan-tiation by drawing a document segment s d,k from  X  . Our model only draws one instantiation per pair of k and d , so each discovered instantiation within a document is a separate relation. We then choose the specific sentence z d,k uniformly from within the seg-ment, and the indicator word i d,k and argument con-stituent a d,k uniformly from within that sentence. Generating Text Finally, we draw the feature val-ues. We make a Na  X   X ve Bayes assumption between features, drawing each independently conditioned on relation structure. For a word w , we want all re-lations to be able to influence its generation. Toward this end, we compute the element-wise product of feature parameters across relations k = 1 ,...,K , using indicator parameters  X  i k if relation k selected w as an indicator word (if i d,k = w ) and background parameters  X  bi k otherwise. The result is then normal-ized to form a valid multinomial that produces word w  X  X  features. Constituents are drawn similarly from every relations X  argument distributions. The model presented above leverages relation reg-ularities in local features and document placement. However, it is unable to specify global syntactic preferences about relation expression, such as indi-cators and arguments being in the same clause. An-other issue with this model is that different relations could overlap in their indicators and arguments. 6
To overcome these obstacles, we apply declara-tive constraints by imposing inequality constraints on expectations of the posterior during inference using posterior regularization (Grac  X a et al., 2007). In this section we present the technical details of the approach; Section 5 explains the specific linguistically-motivated constraints we consider. 4.1 Inference with Posterior Regularization We first review how posterior regularization impacts the variational inference procedure in general. Let  X  , z , and x denote the parameters, hidden struc-ture, and observations of an arbitrary model. We are interested in estimating the posterior distribution p (  X ,z | x ) by finding a distribution q (  X ,z )  X  X  that is minimal in KL-divergence to the true posterior:
KL( q (  X ,z ) k p (  X ,z | x )) For tractability, variational inference typically makes a mean-field assumption that restricts the set Q to distributions where  X  and z are independent, i.e. , q (  X ,z ) = q (  X  ) q ( z ) . We then optimize equa-tion 1 by coordinate-wise descent on q (  X  ) and q ( z ) .
To incorporate constraints into inference, we fur-ther restrict Q to distributions that satisfy a given set of inequality constraints, each of the form [ f ( z )]  X  b . Here, f ( z ) is a deterministic func-tion of z and b is a user-specified threshold. Inequal-ities in the opposite direction simply require negat-ing f ( z ) and b . For example, we could apply a syn-tactic constraint of the form E q [ f ( z )]  X  b , where f ( z ) counts the number of indicator/argument pairs that are syntactically connected in a pre-specified manner ( e.g. , the indicator and argument modify the same verb), and b is a fixed threshold.

Given a set C of constraints with functions f c ( z ) and thresholds b c , the updates for q (  X  ) and q ( z ) from equation 1 are as follows: q (  X  ) = argmin where q 0 (  X  )  X  exp E q ( z ) [log p (  X ,z,x )] , and q ( z ) = argmin where q 0 ( z )  X  exp E q (  X  ) [log p (  X ,z,x )] . Equation 2 is not affected by the posterior constraints and is up-dated by setting q (  X  ) to q 0 (  X  ) . We solve equation 3 in its dual form (Grac  X a et al., 2007): argmin With the box constraints of equation 4, a numerical optimization procedure such as L-BFGS-B (Byrd et al., 1995) can be used to find optimal dual pa-rameters  X   X  . The original q ( z ) is then updated to q ( z ) exp  X  P c  X  X   X   X  c f c ( z ) and renormalized. 4.2 Updates for our Model Our model uses this mean-field factorization: q (  X , X ,z,a,i ) = ) In the above,  X   X  and  X   X  are Dirichlet distribution pa-rameters, and  X  c are multinomial parameters. Note that we do not factorize the distribution of z , i , and a for a single document and relation, instead repre-senting their joint distribution with a single set of variational parameters  X  c . This is tractable because a single relation occurs only once per document, re-ducing the joint search space of z , i , and a . The factors in equation 5 are updated one at a time while holding the other factors fixed.
 Updating  X   X  Due to the Na  X   X ve Bayes assumption between features, each feature X  X  q (  X  ) distributions can be updated separately. However, the product between feature parameters of different relations in-troduces a nonconjugacy in the model, precluding a closed form update. Instead we numerically opti-mize equation 1 with respect to each  X   X  , similarly to previous work (Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2008). For instance,  X   X  i k, X  of relation k and feature  X  is updated by finding the gradient of equation 1 with respect to  X   X  k, X  and applying L-BFGS. Parameters  X   X  ba are updated analogously.
 Updating  X   X  This update follows the standard closed form for Dirichlet parameters: where C ` counts the number of times z falls into seg-ment ` of a document.
 Updating  X  c Parameters  X  c are updated by first com-puting an unconstrained update q 0 ( z,a,i ;  X  c 0 ) :  X  c We then perform the minimization on the dual in equation 4 under the provided constraints to derive a final update to the constrained  X  c .
 Simplifying Approximation The update for  X   X  re-quires numerical optimization due to the nonconju-gacy introduced by the point-wise product in fea-ture generation. If instead we have every relation type separately generate a copy of the corpus, the  X   X  updates becomes closed-form expressions similar to equation 6. This approximation yields similar pa-rameter estimates as the true updates while vastly improving speed, so we use it in our experiments. We now have the machinery to incorporate a va-riety of declarative constraints during inference. The classes of domain-independent constraints we study are summarized in Table 1. For the propor-tion constraints we arbitrarily select a threshold of 80% without any tuning, in the spirit of building a domain-independent approach.
 Syntax As previous work has observed, most rela-tions are expressed using a limited number of com-mon syntactic patterns (Riloff, 1996; Banko and Et-zioni, 2008). Our syntactic constraint captures this insight by requiring that a certain proportion of the induced instantiations for each relation match one of these syntactic patterns:  X  The indicator is a verb and the argument X  X   X  The indicator is a noun and the argument is a  X  The indicator is a noun in a verb X  X  subject and Prevalence For a relation to be domain-relevant, it should occur in numerous documents across the cor-pus, so we institute a constraint on the number of times a relation is instantiated. Note that the effect of this constraint could also be achieved by tuning the prior probability of a relation not occurring in a document. However, this prior would need to be ad-justed every time the number of documents or fea-ture selection changes; using a constraint is an ap-pealing alternative that is portable across domains. Separation The separation constraint encourages diversity in the discovered relation types by restrict-ing the number of times a single word can serve as either an indicator or part of the argument of a re-lation instance. Specifically, we require that every token of the corpus occurs at most once as a word in a relation X  X  argument in expectation. On the other hand, a single word can sometimes be evocative of multiple relations ( e.g. ,  X  X ccurred X  signals both date and time in  X  X ccurred on Friday at 3pm X ). Thus, we allow each word to serve as an indicator more than once, arbitrarily fixing the limit at two. Datasets and Metrics We evaluate on two datasets, financial market reports and newswire articles about earthquakes, previously used in work on high-level content analysis (Barzilay and Lee, 2004; Lap-ata, 2006). Finance articles chronicle daily mar-ket movements of currencies and stock indexes, and earthquake articles document specific earthquakes. Constituent parses are obtained automatically us-ing the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and then converted to dependency parses using the PennConvertor tool (Johansson and Nugues, 2007). We manually annotated relations for both corpora, selecting relation types that occurred frequently in each domain. We found 15 types for finance and 9 for earthquake . Corpus statistics are summarized below, and example relation types are shown in Ta-ble 2.

In our task, annotation conventions for desired output relations can greatly impact token-level per-formance, and the model cannot learn to fit a par-ticular convention by looking at example data. For example, earthquakes times are frequently reported in both local and GMT, and either may be arbitrar-ily chosen as correct. Moreover, the baseline we compare against produces lambda calculus formulas rather than spans of text as output, so a token-level comparison requires transforming its output.
For these reasons, we evaluate on both sentence-level and token-level precision, recall, and F-score. Precision is measured by mapping every induced re-lation cluster to its closest gold relation and comput-ing the proportion of predicted sentences or words that are correct. Conversely, for recall we map ev-ery gold relation to its closest predicted relation and find the proportion of gold sentences or words that are predicted. This mapping technique is based on the many-to-one scheme used for evaluating unsu-pervised part-of-speech induction (Johnson, 2007). Note that sentence-level scores are always at least as high as token-level scores, since it is possible to se-lect a sentence correctly but none of its true relation tokens while the opposite is not possible.
 Domain-specific Constraints On top of the cross-domain constraints from Section 5, we study whether imposing basic domain-specific constraints can be beneficial. The finance dataset is heav-ily quantitative, so we consider applying a single domain-specific constraint stating that most rela-tion arguments should include a number. Likewise, earthquake articles are typically written with a ma-jority of the relevant information toward the begin-ning of the document, so its domain-specific con-straint is that most relations should occur in the first two sentences of a document. Note that these domain-specific constraints are not specific to in-dividual relations or instances, but rather encode a preference across all relation types. In both cases, we again use an 80% threshold without tuning. Features For indicators, we use the word, part of speech, and word stem. For arguments, we use the word, syntactic constituent label, the head word of the parent constituent, and the dependency label of the argument to its parent.
 Baselines We compare against three alternative un-supervised approaches. Note that the first two only identify relation-bearing sentences, not the specific words that participate in the relation.

Clustering (CLUTO) : A straightforward way of identifying sentences bearing the same relation is to simply cluster them. We implement a cluster-ing baseline using the CLUTO toolkit with word and part-of-speech features. As with our model, we set the number of clusters K to the true number of rela-tion types.

Mallows Topic Model (MTM) : Another technique for grouping similar sentences is the Mallows-based topic model of Chen et al. (2009). The datasets we consider here exhibit high-level regularities in con-tent organization, so we expect that a topic model with global constraints could identify plausible clus-ters of relation-bearing sentences. Again, K is set to the true number of relation types.

Unsupervised Semantic Parsing (USP) : Our fi-nal unsupervised comparison is to USP, an unsuper-vised deep semantic parser introduced by Poon and Domingos (2009). USP induces a lambda calculus representation of an entire corpus and was shown to be competitive with open information extraction ap-proaches (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Banko et al., 2007). We give USP the required Stanford dependency for-mat as input (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). We find that the results are sensitive to the cluster granu-larity prior, so we tune this parameter and report the best-performing runs.

We recognize that USP targets a different out-put representation than ours: a hierarchical semantic structure over the entirety of a dependency-parsed text. In contrast, we focus on discovering a limited number K of domain-relevant relations expressed as constituent phrases. Despite these differences, both methods ultimately aim to capture domain-specific relations expressed with varying verbalizations, and both operate over in-domain input corpora supple-mented with syntactic information. For these rea-sons, USP provides a clear and valuable point of comparison. For this comparison, we transform USP X  X  lambda calculus formulas to relation spans as follows. First, we group lambda forms by a combi-nation of core form, argument form, and the parent X  X  core form. 7 We then filter to the K relations that appear in the most documents. For token-level eval-uation we take the dependency tree fragment corre-sponding to the lambda form. For example, in the sentence  X  X  strong earthquake rocked the Philippines island of Mindoro early Tuesday, X  USP learns that the word  X  X uesday X  has a core form corresponding to words { Tuesday , Wednesday , Saturday } , a parent form corresponding to words { shook , rock , hit , jolt } , and an argument form of TMOD; all phrases with this same combination are grouped as a relation. Training Regimes and Hyperparameters For each run of our model we perform three random restarts to convergence and select the posterior with lowest final free energy. We fix K to the true number of annotated relation types for both our model and USP and L (the number of document segments) to five. Dirichlet hyperparameters are set to 0.1. Table 3 X  X  first two sections present the results of our main evaluation. For earthquake , the far more diffi-cult domain, our base model with only the domain-independent constraints strongly outperforms all three baselines across both metrics. For finance , the CLUTO and USP baselines achieve performance comparable to or slightly better than our base model. Our approach, however, has the advantage of provid-ing a formalism for seamlessly incorporating addi-tional arbitrary domain-specific constraints. When we add such constraints (denoted as model+DSC ), we achieve consistently higher performance than all baselines across both datasets and metrics, demon-strating that this approach provides a simple and ef-fective framework for injecting domain knowledge into relation discovery.
The first two baselines correspond to a setup where the number of sentence clusters K is set to the true number of relation types. This has the effect of lowering precision because each sentence must be assigned a cluster. To mitigate this impact, we exper-imented with using K + N clusters, with N ranging from 1 to 30. In each case, we then keep only the K largest clusters. For the earthquake dataset, increas-ing N improves performance until some point, after which performance degrades. However, the best F-Score corresponding to the optimal number of clus-ters is 42.2, still far below our model X  X  66.0 F-score. For the finance domain, increasing the number of clusters hurts performance.

Our results show a large gap in F-score between the sentence and token-level evaluations for both the USP baseline and our model. A qualitative analysis of the results indicates that our model often picks up on regularities that are difficult to distinguish with-out relation-specific supervision. For earthquake , a location may be annotated as  X  X he Philippine island of Mindoro X  while we predict just the word  X  X in-doro. X  For finance , an index change can be anno-tated as  X 30 points, or 0.8 percent, X  while our model identifies  X 30 points X  and  X 0.8 percent X  as separate relations. In practice, these outputs are all plausi-ble discoveries, and a practitioner desiring specific outputs could impose additional constraints to guide relation discovery toward them.
 The Impact of Constraints To understand the im-pact of the declarative constraints, we perform an ablation analysis on the constraint sets. We con-sider removing the constraints on syntactic patterns ( no-syn ) and the constraints disallowing relations to overlap ( no-sep ) from the full domain-independent model. 8 We also try a version with hard syntac-tic constraints ( hard-syn ), which requires that every extraction match one of the three syntactic patterns specified by the syntactic constraint.

Table 3 X  X  bottom section presents the results of this evaluation. The model X  X  performance degrades when either of the two constraint sets are removed, demonstrating that the constraints are in fact benefi-cial for relation discovery. Additionally, in the hard-syn case, performance drops dramatically for finance while remaining almost unchanged for earthquake . This suggests that formulating constraints as soft in-equalities on posterior expectations gives our model the flexibility to accommodate both the underlying signal in the data and the declarative constraints. Comparison against Supervised CRF Our final set of experiments compares a semi-supervised ver-sion of our model against a conditional random field (CRF) model. The CRF model was trained using the same features as our model X  X  argument features. To incorporate training examples in our model, we simply treat annotated relation instances as observed variables. For both the baselines and our model, we experiment with using up to 10 annotated docu-ments. At each of those levels of supervision, we av-erage results over 10 randomly drawn training sets.
At the sentence level, our model compares very favorably to the supervised CRF. For finance , it takes at least 10 annotated documents (corresponding to roughly 130 annotated relation instances) for the CRF to match the semi-supervised model X  X  perfor-mance. For earthquake , using even 10 annotated documents (about 71 relation instances) is not suf-ficient to match our model X  X  performance.

At the token level, the supervised CRF base-line is far more competitive. Using a single la-beled document (13 relation instances) yields su-perior performance to either of our model variants for finance , while four labeled documents (29 re-lation instances) do the same for earthquake . This result is not surprising X  X ur model makes strong domain-independent assumptions about how under-lying patterns of regularities in the text connect to relation expression. Without domain-specific super-vision such assumptions are necessary, but they can prevent the model from fully utilizing available la-beled instances. Moreover, being able to annotate even a single document requires a broad understand-ing of every relation type germane to the domain, which can be infeasible when there are many unfa-miliar, complex domains to process.

In light of our strong sentence-level performance, this suggests a possible human-assisted application: use our model to identify promising relation-bearing sentences in a new domain, then have a human an-notate those sentences for use by a supervised ap-proach to achieve optimal token-level extraction. This paper has presented a constraint-based ap-proach to in-domain relation discovery. We have shown that a generative model augmented with declarative constraints on the model posterior can successfully identify domain-relevant relations and their instantiations. Furthermore, we found that a single set of constraints can be used across divergent domains, and that tailoring constraints specific to a domain can yield further performance benefits.
