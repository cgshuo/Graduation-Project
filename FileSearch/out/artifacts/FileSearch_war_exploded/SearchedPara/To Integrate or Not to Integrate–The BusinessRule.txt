 The modelling of business processes and business rules has been an important topic of Information Systems and Computer Science research over the last two decades [ 1 Traditionally, business rules are modelled in a standalone fashion using rule modelling notations. In more recent years, as new modelling languages and methods have been developed [ 3 ], researchers have argued that business rules can be modelled indepen-dently or integrated into business processes [ 4 , 5 ]. Several researchers have motivated posited to result in improved model understanding, increased interoperability capacity, better change propagation of new requirements and increased capacity for compliance management [ 8  X  10 ]. Previous research has made several contributions towards this end through analyzing the representational capacity, de fi ciency and overlap of process and rule modelling languages [ 11 ], with a view towards their integrated use. Several initial approaches for the integration of business process models and business rules have also been proposed [ 12 ].
 Empirical fi ndings [ 13 ] indicate that process designers often have the need to represent in a process model business rules that go beyond control all process models contain some business rules in the way of control may be, and often are, documented separately. Representing process models graphi-cally without all relevant rules or operational constraints can result in making and non-compliant process execution. It is also a roadblock to achieving a holistic understanding of the process, and thus affects shared understanding of requirements between stakeholders. In turn, incomplete requirements lead to incom-plete system implementation, in which business processes might be executed without necessary constraints and monitoring mechanisms and, thus, might lead to high costs due to operational and compliance risks.
 We argue, along the lines of [ 3 ], that there are situations under which a business rule is better modelled independently from a business process model, and situations under which it is more appropriate to integrate the rule with a business process model. It follows then that an important aspect of integrated modelling is the understanding of such situations and how they in fl uence business rule representation. While the decision in regards to how a rule should be modelled is not a straightforward one, little guidance exists that can help modelers make such a decision. This shortcoming results in fragmented and inconsistent business process and rule models. In our earlier work [ 14 ] two-fold: (1) to empirically evaluate the factors; (2) to identify guidelines for better business rule modelling decisions.
 This paper unfolds as follows. The next section provides an overview of business process and business rule modelling, as well as prior efforts to identify factors that in fl uence integration in the context of modelling. Section 3 overview the methodology used earlier for factor identi fi cation, and presents the methodology for empirical eval-uation of the factors. Section 4 summarizes the factors and Sect. 5 discusses the empirical evaluation. Section 6 provides an empirically-grounded discussion on how these factors should affect rule modelling. Finally, we summarize the results of our study in terms of the evaluation results and provide some guidelines for modeling of business rules. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the fi ndings and future outlook. A business process model is a structured collection of activities that accomplishes a speci fi c goal that will create value for an organization. Such structures also involve business rule models, which describe the constraints and requirements guiding and controlling the behavior of business activities, and can be integrated into related busi-ness process models or modelled independently. Business process modelling and business rule modelling both focus on creating a representation of the organization current and future practices. They are complementary approaches as they address dis-tinct aspects of organizational practices. However, the two approaches evolved sepa-rately over the last few decades and failed to integrate into a more powerful approach. been developed in literature viz. annotation , encapsulation and extension [ 12 ]. Anno-the representational capacity of the selected modelling language. The textual elements are typically attached to graphical symbols within the process model to represent extra information. Encapsulation is the embedding of related business rules into a speci element in business process models. The embedded rules can be folded and unfolded, thus allowing users to easily switch focus between the overall structure and detailed parts of a process model. Extension either creates new elements or combines existing meta-elements from other languages to increase the representation capability of the underlying language to represent both business activities and business rules. Figure 1 is a simplistic illustration of a business process model with rule integration, using an-notation , encapsulation , and extension methods.
 well studied as stated Sect. 1 , there is a paucity of research that examines or consol-idates factors that are relevant for business process model and business rule integration. zur Muehlen et al. [ 3 ] were the fi rst to argue the need for guidelines to inform such integration. They identi fi ed fi ve potential factors expected to in tation of a business. However, without proper evaluation, the validity of each factor cannot be fully established. Investigation and validation of each factor in fl uence on the representation of a business rule is also needed, which is the aim of our work as presented in the following sections. Our study involves two phases, viz . factor identi fi cation and factor validation. The while the second is an empirical study of business rule experts in the form of academics and practitioners. In the following sub-sections, we outline our methodology. 3.1 Factor Identi fi cation In our earlier work we embarked on a systematic identi fi identify these factors, we conducted a systematic literature review based on a com-prehensive set of well-regarded Information Systems and Computer Science journals and conferences (see www.aisnet.org and www.core.edu.au ) published between 1990 Our data set consisted of 43,021 full-text articles (see Table 1 ). Each article was prepared (with OCR) for a full-text search. Subsequently, a full-text search was con-ducted using the term  X  business rule  X  . We regarded a paper as relevant if the keyword  X  business rule  X  occurred 3 times or more within the body of the text and only selected those papers for the next round of analysis that met this criterion. Based on this elimination process, 255 relevant papers were identi fi ed. For each of the 255 papers, we read the abstract, the introduction of the paper, and each paragraph where the term  X  rule  X  occurred to determine if the paper was relevant to our purpose. A paper was identi fi ed as relevant if a characteristic of a business rule like change frequency, reusability or impact is discussed or mentioned in the paper. This step resulted in the identi fi cation of 78 papers.
 The set of 78 relevant papers was then read in full and manually coded with a dedicated coding protocol implemented via an Excel spreadsheet. The coding protocol was designed and agreed by the three researchers after an initial coding of several context, and other comments. One researcher carried out the initial coding exercise through iterative coding of the papers to identify all relevant factors and then re the result with the two researchers. The re fi nement included (1) selecting business rule characteristics that had the potential to be factors and excluding unrelated character-istics, (2) identifying and clustering synonymous factors and (3) selecting a repre-sentative label for each factor and clarifying its de fi nition. The result was re three iterations until all three researchers were satis fi of each factor. Twelve factors were identi fi ed in total through this process, as sum-marized in Sect. 4 and detailed in full in [ 14 ].
 3.2 Empirical Evaluation we designed an empirical evaluation instrument. The authors of the 78 papers relevant for the factor identi fi cation were the target participants of the empirical evaluation. These academics and professionals were invited to participate in an online survey through invitation emails. In the invitation email, participants were informed about the background and nature of the study, for which no incentives were offered. We used Qualtrics 1 as the platform to deliver the survey and collect data.
 round of pilot testing, 3 PhD students with knowledge of conceptual modeling were asked to complete the survey and provide feedback on clarity of factor de questions. In the second round, the revised survey was pilot-tested with 2 PhD students and a Master student by research, with knowledge of conceptual modelling and an international expert in requirements modelling. The revisions as a result of the pilot studies included changes to the de fi nitions of factors and to questions so as to improve clarity as well as research rigor (e.g. randomization of questions was introduced through the pilot study). With our fi nalized survey instrument, we collected (1) the importance of factors, (2) an importance ranking of the factors from each participant and (3) expert opinions on how rules should be modelled given each factor. total, of which 13 were incomplete and had to be removed. Thus, we received 22 usable responses, which represents a response rate of 23.08 % when calculated as responses per paper. While low, it is hard to achieve high response rates in empirical research and many consider any response rate of approximately 20 % to be usable [ 15 In total, twelve factors were identi fi ed. For further discussion of the factors, and the provide as a summary the de fi nition of each factor, with arguments collected from the literature review. Only the de fi nitions (in italics) are used in the survey and the argument statements or examples are excluded to avoid possible introduction of bias in the responses.
 Accessibility. Accessibility refers to the user  X  s need to view and manipulate a business his or her need, then the rule has high accessibility, otherwise, the rule has low acces-sibility. Making business rule repositories accessible to stakeholders whenever required, potentially reduce the complexity and waiting times in making changes required in response to speci fi c external or internal changes in requirements [ 19 ]. Agility. Agility refers to how quickly a business rule can be adapted to a change. Rate of change deals with how frequently the rule needs to be changed, and agility deals with how long will it take for each change to be modelled in a rule. Some business rules are required to take effect immediately to ensure the agility of the system [ 19 ]. Similarly, there can be others that may not have strict constraints on time of initiation [ 20  X  22 ].
 Aspect of Change. Aspect of Change refers to the component of the rule that can be changed. The components of a rule that could change are the trigger condition, the reaction, or the values of parameters, as well as rule phrases and design elements [ 23 ]. Depending on the component, the change might be simple or complex. While a graphical process model may expose some simple con fi guration to business users, more complex business rule changes may only be possible at a deeper level that may need a business rule language representation.
 Awareness of Impact. Awareness of Impact refers to how comprehensively the implications of a business rule, or its revisions, are understood. Some business rules have a direct and clear impact, while other rules may have an indirect or unclear impact. Thus, the impact may or may not be clear to the stakeholders. Business users may have to bring to bear their additional external knowledge to understand the implications of a business rule [ 24 ]. If the impacts of a business rule are not com-prehensively understood, e.g. a change in one department  X  necessitated by a change in another department and the effects cannot be safely pre-dicted, then the deployment and implementation of the rule may need justi re-engineering in the future [ 3 ]. The advantage of rule models is implementation in case adjustments needs to be made  X  [ 3 ].
 Complexity. Complexity refers to the level of dif fi culty in de business rule. Some rules are simple and some rules can be complex in nature. Thus, the clarity and simplicity of business rules may differ based on the chosen represen-tation [ 25 ]. Certain kinds of business rules cannot be clearly expressed in a business process modelling language due to language representation limitations, while others may be easily modelled as a standalone rule due to the more precise representation capability [ 26 ].
 Criticality. Criticality refers to the importance of the rule. Violation of critical rules can lead to severe consequences for the organization, while violation of non -critical rules may be less severe. Integrating a business rule into a business process model can ensure that the business rule is implemented enterprise-wide. A standalone business rule, on the other hand, has a risk of being overlooked when users perform manual tasks relying on process models as guidelines for operations.
 Governance Responsibility. Governance Responsibility refers to who ensures that business activities are in accordance with business rules. Rules can be governed automatically by programs/systems, or manually by humans [ 27 , 28 ]. If the business rule is to be checked automatically in the system, machine readability and execution will be a basic requirement, while context availability and user-friendly representation will be more important if the rule is to be checked by a human. Implementation Responsibility. Implementation Responsibility refers to who is charged with implementing or updating the business rule. Both business users and technical users could be responsible for the implementation of a business rule. Busi-ness users generally have the con fi guration responsibility over business rules in busi-ness rule repositories [ 3 ] and may not have process modelling expertise, whereas technical staff or the IT department may be responsible for the implementation of business processes [ 29 ].
 Rate of Change. Rate of Change refers to the frequency at which a business rule requires modi fi cation. Business rules can change in response to changes in regulations and policies. Frequent business rule change requires mechanisms that support easy modi fi cation and propagation. It is possible that frequently changed business rules could be modelled in a stand-alone fashion, rather than being integrated into graphical process models where they could be labor-intensive and cumbersome to update [ 30 ], while stable business rules could be integrated into a business process model. Reusability. Reusability refers to the potential for a rule to be used in new contexts. An existing business rule may be adapted or modi fi ed to fi reduce the resources required in developing new rules. Scattered [ 26 , 31 ] and dupli-[ 32 , 33 ]. If a reusable business rule is integrated into a business process model, the development, testing, and maintenance efforts may be increased when that rule changes and requires update [ 23 , 34 ]. On the contrary, modelling such a rule in a business rule notation and storing it in a business rule engine could ease maintenance efforts. Rule Source. Rule Source refers to the origin of the business rule. Rule sources could be external or internal  X  e.g. laws and regulations or internal policies and standards. Requirements de fi ned by external regulatory bodies can be while being outside the scope of their control. Particularly when the changes pertain to part of a business process ensures that an audit trail is created, and thus facilitates compliance management and audit.
 Scope of Impact. Scope of Impact refers to the breadth of the impact of the rule. The impact of a business rule can be focused on an activity, an entire process, a department large number of business process models any update to the rule will lead to a change in a large number of models, thus triggering re-work and risk of inconsistency [ 3 , 35 ]. If the same business rule resides in a business rule repository, the update effort will be limited to an individual business rule instance, while being linked to potentially several process models. In this section we present the empirical validation of the twelve factors. The main aim of the empirical study was to derive a ranking of factors based on their perceived importance by experts and capture expert indications as to how these factors affect modelling business rules in practice. To this end, in the following we discussion of the relative ranking of the twelve factors, considering also the level of expert agreement in their ranking lists, and then explore the indications as to how these factors affect modelling of business rules. 5.1 Demographics Our survey was aimed at academics and practitioners who authored the 78 papers relevant to this study. Table 2 shows that the overall business process modelling experience of our participants is higher than in other similar studies, e.g. [ 13 ]. How-ever, the experience of standalone rule modelling is slightly lower than that of pro-cesses modelling, indicating that less participants are familiar with standalone rule modelling. 5.2 Factor Importance To distinguish the relative importance of each factor, we asked the participants to select at least 5 most important factors and rank them according to their relative importance. As current top-k ranking comparison algorithms require a constant k across all rankings [ 36 ], only the top-5 factors are calculated in the ranking and agreement analysis. We question, but these factors are already in top 50% of factors based on importance (see Table 5 ).
 To calculate consensus between the participants, the rankings provided by all help minimize the overall distances between rankings. Since this is an NP-Hard problem, some relaxed methods are used to fi nd the approximate closest distance [ 37 ]. We adopted the classical positional Borda  X  s method [ 38 ] to calculate the aggregated ranking, which is well adopted in literature [ 37 , 39 ].
 assign 5-i points to the factor. For a factor which is not ranked within the top 5, we assign 0 points. The total points of each factor are a sum of the factor individual ranking.
 and criticality is a close second. The factors rate of change and reusability are jointly ranked third, with 37 points. Accessibility , awareness of impact , complexity , gover-nance responsibility and scope of impact follow in that order. The lowest ranked three factors are found to be those of aspect of change , implementation responsibility and rule source .
 determine whether there is an adequate level of agreement between experts rankings. The concordance of the rankings is an indicator of such agreement. We use identical with each other (i.e. participants agree with each other) while 1 means they share nothing in common. Since for normalized concordance, 1 represents total agreement and 0 represents total disagreement semantically, concordance has an inverse relationship with compactness. Thus we use 1  X  compactness to measure concordance.
 distance between all factors, and r i  X  r j is the distance between two rankings r Weber et al. [ 36 ] provide a detailed classi fi cation of ranking distance measures in different dimensions according to the nature of the rankings. The dimensions are (1) conjoint and unconjoint ranking, (2) tied and untied ranking and (3) partial and full ranking is a partial and conjoint ranking without ties. So we adopt the widely used Kendall  X  s tao method introduced in [ 42 ] to calculate r ranking r i and r j . p is assigned  X  as the neutral approach. The detailed algorithm to calculate K is described in [ 42 ]. Combining formulas ( 1 ) and ( 2 ), the compactness of all the rankings is 0.36, resulting degree of agreement among the participants  X  rankings is 0.64, which is deemed acceptable [ 41 ]. In addition to the compactness of all rankings, we can reason about the compactness, or agreement, of the importance of each individual factor by considering the standard deviation of its ranking position. Accordingly, Table 3 also shows the standard deviation for each factor to provide an indication of the level of agreement on that factor. In the fi rst part of our empirical analysis we were able to identify a relative ranking of the factors. While this ranking provides an indication as to which factors should be considered when modelling business rules, it does not provide any guidance as to how a rule should be modelled given a particular factor. To carry out such an analysis we must fi rst determine the set of factors that had consistency of responses in terms of their effect on business rule modelling. Thus, we fi rst distinguish between and  X  non-affecting  X  factors. A factor is considered to be non-affecting if there is no signi fi cant difference in expert opinion as to how that factor affects modelling. For example, experts are asked to indicate for the aspect of change factor, which has two circumstances: simple and complex, if the rule (to be changed or added) should be modelled in an integrated manner or modelled separately (see Table 4 ).
 The decision distributions are identical regardless of the complexity of change, thus the factor aspect of change is considered to be a non-affecting factor because regardless of the circumstance (i.e. simple or complex), experts favor independent modelling. We use the difference of votes across the two opposite values of a factor as the metric of 10% of the number of participants) both for integrated and independent modelling, then the factor is considered non-affecting.
 ordered by their rankings in Table 3 ). The table shows that 4 factors in the 6 top 50% are affecting, and 5 factors in the 6 bottom 50% are not affecting. Criticality and awareness of impact are not affecting although ranked high on importance, and rule source is affecting although ranked lowest of importance.

 independent modelling and for integrated modelling, which is used as an indication of modelling decision. A modelling decision for either type of modelling can be derived if the difference in votes is at least 3 (the roundup integer of 10% of the number of participants), otherwise the data can be interpreted as not providing any dominant view of the type of modelling that is appropriate (noted in Table 6 as in Table 6 , for the agility factor, where the need of agility is high, there are 13 more votes for independent modelling than for integrated modelling, so independent mod-elling is the dominant view for modeling.
 Based on this analysis, the modelling decision is analysed for each circumstance of a given factor. While there are three situations in which the experts could not agree on a modelling decision, modelling guidance can be derived for the following seven situations: 1. When a rule has relatively high agility, it should be modelled independently. 2. When a rule changes frequently, it should be modelled independently. 3. When a rule changes infrequently it should be integrated in a business process model. 4. When a rule is highly reusable, it should be modelled independently. 6. When a rule requires relatively high accessibility, it should be modelled independently. 7. When a rule comes from an external source, it should be modelled independently. To provide further insights into the rationale of the responses, in the following we brie fl y highlight relevant insights for non-affecting factors, which were collected through open-ended comment sections for each factor in our survey. We use the symbol P and a number to represent the participant number.
 Criticality. The opinions on factor criticality are con fl  X  it  X  s obviously more important that critical business rules are modelled in safe and reliable ways than for less critical roles  X  ( P20 ) and  X  enforcement or monitoring of rule violations  X  ( P11 ), but about whether the rule can be embedded in the business process or not  X  whether this is done through a BRMS or a BPMS or manually does not matter, as long as it is effective .  X  ( P11 ).
 Awareness of impact. Awareness of impact  X  could not always be estimated and could not be easily represented  X  ( P10 ), and  X  a rule may impact a process or something else ( P11 ), thus it is considered as a less important factor.
 Complexity . Since  X  BPMN is not suitable for BR modelling complex rules can be easier to handle in a dedicated rule representation than integrated into a business process.
 Governance Responsibility. The importance of governance responsibility is chal-lenged as  X  a business rule can be modelled separately and be embedded in a business process at the same time  X  ( P20 ), and  X  it depends on if the process model executed by a BPMS or will a rulebook be used  X  .( P16 ).
 Scope of Impact. Participants admit that  X  it might be easier to see which swim lanes are affected by the rule change and how a separately modelled and maintained BR scopes is hard to understand from a single BR out of context believe this factor  X  has more to do with governance and documentation than with modelling  X  ( P17 ). rule representation  X  ( P11 ). So the preference is independent modelling regardless of whether the change is complex or simple.
 Implementation Responsibility . Participants argue that  X  have different responsibilities for the same set of rules assumption that modelling process and implementation process are separated. This paper recapped twelve factors that are thought to potentially in on whether a business rule is modelled independently or modelled in a business process model [ 14 ]. We explored empirically the relative importance of the identi factors with academic experts and identi fi ed agility as the most important factor, fol-complexity , governance responsibility and scope of impact ,with aspect of change , implementation responsibility and rule source being the least important factors. We also explored expert indications of how a business rule should be modelled given each factor, which lead us to derive seven guidelines for business rule modelling. have a relatively high level of in fl uence. Different modelling languages, tools and integrated modelling methods will affect these factors differently and will be a promising topic for future research. Second, we limit our scope of rules to those that can be both modelled independently as well as modelled with a business process. The rules that do not have the capability to be modelled into processes are beyond our discussion since there is no option for an alternative modelling decision. Although semantics and types of rule can be used to distinguish these rules in some cases, our study participants are predominantly academic experts in the common practice are also critical to understand and are the next step in our study. Following that step, we plan to develop a decision framework and prototype to guide business rule modelling decisions. We expect that further empirical study will help to extend the decision framework through deeper insights into the decision processes.
