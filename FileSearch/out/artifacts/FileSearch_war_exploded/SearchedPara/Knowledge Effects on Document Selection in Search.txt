Click through events in search results pages (SERPs) are not reliable implicit indicators of document relevance. A user X  X  task and domain knowledge are key factors in recog-nition and link selection and the most useful SERP docu-ment links may be those that best match the user X  X  domain knowledge. User study participants rated their knowledge of genomics MeSH terms bef ore conducting 2004 TREC Ge-nomics Track tasks. Each participant X  X  document knowl-edge was represented by their knowledge of the indexing MeSH terms. Results show high, intermediate, and low domain knowledge groups had similar document selection SERP rank distributions. SERP link selection distribution varied when participant knowledge of the available docu-ments was analyzed. High domain knowledge participants usually selected a document with the highest personal knowl-edge rating. Low domain knowledge participants were rea-sonably successful at selecting available documents of which they had the most knowledge, while intermediate knowledge participants often failed to do so. This evidence for knowl-edge effects on SERP link selection may contribute to under-standing the potential for personalization of search results ranking based on user domain knowledge.

Individual click through events in SERPs are not a reliable predictor of document relevance, due, in part, to user habit-ual rank selection bias [3, 2] which may be explained by user expectations of successful interpretation of their query. Al-ternatively, user SERP selection actions may be dominated by active evaluation of relevance hints in the links [4]. Do-main knowledge or expertise has been shown to affect search behaviors [6, 7] and this work addresses the question of do-main knowledge effects on click through.
Undergraduate and graduate students (n=40) in biology-related programs rated their knowledge of 409 genomics-related MeSH terms (1 X  X  X o knowledge X , 5 X  X  X an explain to others X ). They then performed four recall-oriented search tasks from the 2004 TREC Genomics Track using the In-dri search system with Medline abstracts (n=1.85 million). Search interactions were recorded using a multi-source log-ging system [1]. Technical reasons prevented analysis of two participants.

The participant domain knowledge (PDK) was calculated as ing and i ranges over the terms. t i is 1 if rated or 0 if not. The sum is normalized by a hypothetical expert who rated all terms as  X  X an explain to others X . Hierarchical cluster-ing identified high domain knowledge (HDK) (n=5), inter-mediate domain knowledge (IDK) (n=21), and low domain knowledge (LDK) (n=12) groups.

For each document, the MeSH index terms were matched with the participant X  X  self-reported term knowledge. We used the highest level of knowledge amongst the terms as the document knowledge representation. There is low cov-erage of participant-rated terms in the MeSH indexing space, so many document indexing terms could not be matched.
To reduce learning and knowledge interaction effects, only the first document selected in a SERP was considered. To reduce interface behavior effects, we analyzed cases where the first selected document was in the top five ranks that were available on the display without scrolling.
Figure 1 shows the rank distribution of selected documents by domain knowledge. There is little group variation.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of link selections by doc-ument knowledge representation. The actual selection dis-tribution is contrasted with the distribution if the group Figure 1: Domain knowledge and rank selection bias Figure 2: Link selection by indexing term knowledge participants had always selected a document in the SERP containing the highest-rated indexing term.

The HDK group often selected a document that was the  X  X est X  available. The LDK group was further from optimal. The IDK group was least likely to select the best available documents. Although the number of knowledge level 0 cases (no rated terms in any of the SERP documents) was similar for each group, and knowledge level 1 (highest rated term in all of the SERP documents was  X  X o knowledge X ) was similar for HDK and IDK, both the LDK and IDK groups selected one of these suboptimal documents relatively frequently.
Assuming suitable topicality, documents of which a user has the greatest knowledge are the most likely to be ac-cessible to them. These conceptually accessible documents represent better opportunities to extend user knowledge in ways that contribute to their task goal. That is, such docu-ments are more likely to be useful . The observed differences between the  X  X s selected X  and  X  X ptimal selection X  curves in figure 2 might be regarded as a measure of the potential for personalization of SERP results in the spirit of [5]. HDK participants were effective in such discrimination between document links. Despite a selection handicap for LDK users  X  there were few documents available with high knowledge indexing terms  X  they were rather effective for documents with highest term ratings of 2 ( X  X ague idea X ) and 3 ( X  X ome knowledge X ). This suggests some success for LDK users in discriminating amongst their choices. The IDK group was least successful in getting to the  X  X est X  links.
The results provide evidence for knowledge effects in SERP link selection and suggest that high knowledge users are bet-ter able to discriminate between documents with different knowledge levels. The strong rank bias of high knowledge users may be explained by effective query formulation whose results were ranked by the user X  X  knowledge of the links.
In many task sessions a user gains knowledge as they work towards their goal. These selection behavior observations on low, intermediate, and high domain knowledge groups may be considered from the perspective of changing factors affect-ing selection behavior for a single user within a task session. With respect to user knowledge, the potential for person-alization of SERP link selection may therefore change over a session with the greatest potential in the earlier stages. Early possession of information about a user X  X  knowledge might therefore be important to optimize interactive infor-mation retrieval performance. Unfortunately, this is hard to accomplish at the search server for several reasons. One solution may be client-side domain knowledge modeling and cooperation with a search service.
