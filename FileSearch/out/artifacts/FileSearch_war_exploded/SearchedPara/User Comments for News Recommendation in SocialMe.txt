  X  Reading and Commenting online news is becoming a common user behavior in social media. Discussion in the form of comments following news postings can be effectively facilitated if the ser-vice provider can recommend articles based on not only the orig-inal news itself but also the thread of changing comments. This turns the traditional news recommendation to a  X  X iscussion mod-erator X  that can intelligently assist online forums. In this work, we present a framework to recommend relevant information in the forum-based social media using user comments. When incorpo-rating user comments, we consider structural and semantic infor-mation carried by them. Experiments indicate that our proposed solutions provide an effective recommendation service.
 H.3.3 [ Information Search and Retrieval ]: Information Filtering Algorithms, Experimentation
Web is one of the most important vehicles for  X  X ocial media X , e.g. Internet forums, blogs, wikis, and twitters. One form of so-cial media of particular interest here is self-publishing. In self-publishing, a user can publish an article or post news to share with other users. Other users can read and comment on the posting and these comments can, in turn, be read and commented on. Digg (digg.com) and Yahoo!Buzz (buzz.yahoo.com) are commercial ex-amples of self-publishing. A useful extension of this self-publishing application is to add a recommendation feature to the current dis-cussion thread. That is, based on the original posting and various levels of comments, the system can provide a set of relevant arti-cles, which are expected to be of interest of the active users of the thread.

Here, we explore the problem of news recommendation for dy-namic discussion threads. A fundamental challenge in adaptive news recommendation is to account for topic divergence, i.e. the change of gist during the process of discussion. In a forum, the original news is typically followed by other readers X  opinions, in  X

 the form of comments. Concerns and intention of active users may change as the discussion continues. Therefore, news recommenda-tion, if it were only based on the original posting, can not bene fi t the potentially changing interests of the users. Apparently, there is a need to consider topic evolution in adaptive news recommen-dation and this requires novel techniques that can help to capture topic evolution precisely to prevent wild topic shifting which re-turns completely irrelevant news to users. A related problem is content-based information fi ltering (or recommendation). Most in-formation recommender systems select articles based solely on the contents of the original postings [1] [3] [4].

In this work, we propose a framework of adaptive news recom-mendation in social media. It has the following contributions. (1) It is the fi rst attempt of incorporating reader comments for adaptive news recommendation. (2) We model the relationship among com-ments and that relative to the original posting in order to evaluate their overall impact on recommendations.
The proposed news recommender fi rst constructs a topic pro fi le for each news posting along with the comments from readers, and uses this pro fi le to retrieve relevant news.

We fi rst model the relationship among comments and that rela-tive to the original posting in order to evaluate their overall impact. In our model, we treat the original posting and the comments each as a text node. This model both considers the content similarity between text nodes and the logic relationship among them. On one hand, the content similarity between two nodes can be measured by any commonly adopted metric, such as cosine similarity and Jac-card coef fi cient. This metric is taken over every node pair in the dis-cussion thread. On the other hand, the logic relation between nodes takes two forms. First, a comment is always made in response to the original posting or an earlier comment. In graph theoretic terms, the hierarchy can be represented as a tree  X  =(  X , X   X  ) , where  X  is the set of all text nodes and  X   X  is the edge set. In particular, the original posting is the root and all the comments are ordinary nodes. There is a directed edge  X   X   X   X  from node  X  to node  X  , denoted (  X , X  ) , if the corresponding comment  X  is made in response to com-ment (or original posting)  X  . Second, a comment can quote from one or more earlier comments. From this perspective, the hierar-chy can be modeled using a directed acyclic graph (DAG), denoted  X  =(  X , X   X  ) . There is a directed edge  X   X   X   X  from node  X  to node  X  , denoted (  X , X  ) , if the corresponding comment  X  quotes from comment (or original posting)  X  . As shown in Figure 1, for either graph  X  or  X  , we can use a  X   X   X  X  X  X   X   X  adjacency matrix, denoted  X   X  and  X   X  , respectively, to record them. Inline with the adjacency matrices, we can also use a  X   X   X  X  X  X   X   X  matrix de fi ned on [0 , 1] to record the content similarity between nodes and denote it by  X   X  . Thus, we can combine these three aspects linearly.
Intuitively, the important comments are those whose topics are discussed by a large number of other important comments. There-fore, we propose to apply the PageRank algorithm [2] to rank the comments as where  X  is the damping factor as in PageRank and this value is recommended to be 0.85,  X  and  X  are node indices, and  X   X   X  denotes the number of text nodes in the thread. In addition,  X  (  X  normalized weight of comment  X   X  referring to  X   X  de fi ned as where  X   X , X  is an entry in the graph adjacency matrix and  X  is a constant to avoid division by zero.

Once the importance of comments on one news posting is quan-ti fi ed by our model, this information along with the news itself are fed into a synthesizer to construct a topic pro fi le of this news dis-cussion thread. The pro fi le is a weight vector of terms to model the language used in the thread. Consider a news posting  X  its comment sequence {  X  1 , X  2 ,  X  X  X  X  , X   X  } . For each term  X  , a com-pound weight  X  (  X  ) is calculated. It is a linear combination of the contribution by the news posting itself,  X  1 (  X  ) , and that by the com-ments,  X  2 (  X  ) . The weight contributed by the news itself,  X  The weight contribution from the comments {  X  1 , X  2 ,  X  X  X  X  , X  corporates not only the language features of these documents but also their importance of leading a discussion in related topics. That is, the contribution of comment score is incorporated into weight calculation of the words in a text node. Such a treatment of compounded weight  X  (  X  ) is essentially to rec-ognize that readers X  impact on selecting relevant news and the dif-ference of their in fl uence strength.

With the topic pro fi le constructed as above, we can use it to se-lect relevant news for recommendations. That is, the retriever re-turns an order list of news with decreasing relevance to the topic. Our model to differentiate the importance of each comment can be easily incorporated into any good retrieval model. In this work, our retrieval model is derived from [4].
To gauge how well the proposed recommendation approach per-forms, we carry out a series of experiments on a synthetic data set collected from Digg and Reuters news website. We randomly select 20 news articles with corresponding reader comments from Digg website. These news articles with different topics are treated as the original news postings, recommended news are selected from a cor-pus of articles collected from Reuters news website. This simulates the scenario of recommending relevant news from traditional me-dia to social media readers for their further reading. We compared the proposed approach to three other retrieval approaches as the baseline: one is a simple content fi lter (CF) which treats news and comments as a single topic pro fi le, the other two are well-known news recommendation methods [1], Okapi and LM.

To observe the impact of readers X  concerns on original news posting in social media, we investigate the effect of the three forms of relationship among comments, i.e. content similarity, reply, and quotation. We carry out a series of experiments for this purpose. we fi nd that replies are slightly more effective than quotations and both of these outperform pure content similarity. In other words, the importance of comments can be well evaluated by the logic organization of these comments. We also notice that the incorpora-tion of content similarity decreases the system effectiveness. This may seem to contradict our intuition that the textual information should complement the logic-based models. By further investigat-ing our results, we fi nd that content similarity sometimes misleads the decision on the importance of the comments. Besides, the com-putation cost of calculating the content similarity matrix  X  very high. Therefore, we only apply the structural information to determine the importance of each comment.

We have  X  -tests using  X  @10 and MAP as performance measures, respectively, and the  X  values of these tests are all less than 0.05, which means that the results of experiments are statistically signif-icant. We conduct a series of preliminary experiments to fi nd the optimal performance obtained when the topic fi le word number is 60 and combination coef fi cient  X  is 0.7. As shown in Table 1, the overall performance of the proposed approach performed signi fi -cantly better than the best baseline methods.
In this work, we present a framework for adaptive news rec-ommendation that incorporates information from the entire discus-sion thread. This study can be extended in a few interesting ways. For example, we can use this technique to process personal Web blogs and email archives. The technique itself can also be extended by incorporating such information as reader scores on comments, chronological information of comments, and reputation of users. Indeed, its power is yet to be further improved and investigated.
