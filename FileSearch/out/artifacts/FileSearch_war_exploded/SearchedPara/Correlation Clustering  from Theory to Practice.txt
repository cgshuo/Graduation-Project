 Correlation clustering is arguably the most natural formu-lation of clustering. Given a set of objects and a pairwise similarity measure between them, the goal is to cluster the objects so that, to the best possible extent, similar objects are put in the same cluster and dissimilar objects are put in different clusters. As it just needs a definition of similarity, its broad generality makes it applicable to a wide range of problems in different contexts, and in particular makes it naturally suitable to clustering structured objects for which feature vectors can be difficult to obtain.

Despite its simplicity, generality and wide applicability, correlation clustering has so far received much more atten-tion from the algorithmic theory community than from the data mining community. The goal of this tutorial is to show how correlation clustering can be a powerful addition to the toolkit of the data mining researcher and practitioner, and to encourage discussions and further research in the area.
In the tutorial we will survey the problem and its most common variants, with an emphasis on the algorithmic tech-niques and key ideas developed to derive efficient solutions. We will motivate the problems and discuss real-world appli-cations, the scalability issues that may arise, and the existing approaches to handle them.
 The tutorial is aimed at researchers interested in the theory and applications of clustering. No special knowledge will be assumed other than familiarity with algorithmic techniques from a standard computer science background.
 The tutorial is structured in three main technical parts, plus a concluding part where we will discuss future research agenda. All three technical parts will contain both theory and real-world applications.
