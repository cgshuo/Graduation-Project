 There has been a good amount of research in-vested into improving the temporal interpretation of text. Besides the increasing availability of an-notation standards (e.g., T IME ML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a)) and corpora (e.g., TIDES (Ferro et al., 2000), TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b)), the community has also organized three success-ful evaluation workshops  X  TempEval-1 (Verha-gen et al., 2009), -2 (Verhagen et al., 2010), and -3 (Uzzaman et al., 2013). As the state-of-the-art improves, these workshops have moved away from the piecemeal evaluation of individual tem-poral processing tasks and towards the evaluation of complete end-to-end systems in TempEval-3. We believe our understanding of the temporal in-formation found in text is sufficiently robust, and that there is an opportunity to now leverage this in-formation in downstream applications. In this pa-per, we present our work in incorporating the use of such temporal information into multi-document summarization.

The goal of multi-document summarization is to generate a summary which includes the main points from an input collection of documents with minimal repetition of similar points. We hope to improve the quality of the summaries that are gen-erated by considering temporal information found in the input text. To motivate how temporal in-formation can be useful in summarization, let us refer to Figure 1. The three sentences describe a recent cyclone and a previous one which happened in 1991. Recognizing that sentence (3) is about a storm that had happened in the past is important when writing a summary about the recent storm, as it is not relevant and can likely be excluded.
It is reasonable to expect that a collection of documents about the recent storm will contain more references to it, compared with the earlier one that happened in 1991. Visualized on a time-line, this will translate to more events (bolded in Figure 1) around the time when the recent storm occurred. There should be fewer events mentioned in the collection for the earlier 1991 time period. Figure 2 illustrates a possible timeline laid out with the events found in Figure 1. The events from the more recent storm are found together at the same time. There are fewer events which talk about the previous storm. Thus, temporal informa-tion does assist in identifying which sentences are more relevant to the final summary.

Our work is significant as it addresses an im-portant gap in the exploitation of temporal infor-mation. While there has been prior work making use of temporal information for multi-document appear in Figure 2 are bolded. Figure 2: Possible timeline for events in Figure 1. summarization, they 1) have been largely con-fined to helping to chronologically order content within summaries (Barzilay et al., 1999), or 2) focus only on the use of recency as an indicator of saliency (Goldstein et al., 2000; Wan, 2007). In this work we construct timelines (as a repre-sentation of temporal information) automatically and incorporate them into a state-of-the-art multi-document summarization system. This is achieved with 1) three novel features derived from time-lines to help measure the saliency of sentences, as well as 2) T IME MMR, a modification to the traditional Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998). TimeMMR pro-motes diversity by additionally considering tem-poral information instead of just lexical similari-ties. Through these, we demonstrate that temporal information is useful for multi-document summa-rization. Compared to a competitive baseline, sig-nificant improvements of up to 4.1% are obtained.
Automatic temporal processing systems are not perfect yet, and this may have an impact on their use for downstream applications. This work ad-ditionally proposes the use of the lengths of time-lines as a metric to gauge the usefulness of time-lines. Together with the earlier described contribu-tions, this metric further improves summarization, yielding an overall 5.9% performance increase. Barzilay et al. (1999) were one of the first to use time for multi-document summarization. They recognized the importance of generating a sum-mary which presents the time perspective of the summarized documents correctly. They estimated the chronological ordering of events with a small set of heuristics, and also made use of lexical pat-terns to perform basic time normalization on terms like  X  X oday X  relative to the document creation time. The induced ordering is used to present the selected summary content, following the chrono-logical order in the original documents.

In another line of work, Goldstein et al. (2000) made use of the temporal ordering of documents to be summarized. In computing the relevance of a passage for inclusion into the final summary, they considered the recency of the passage X  X  source document. Passages from more recent documents are deemed to be more important. Wan (2007) and Demartini et al. (2010) made similar assump-tions in their work on T IMED T EXT R ANK and en-tity summarization, respectively.

Instead of just considering the notion of re-cency, Liu et al. (2009) proposed an interesting approach using a temporal graph. Events within a document set correspond to vertices in their pro-posed graph, while edges are determined by the temporal ordering of events. From the resulting weakly-connected graph, the largest forests are as-sumed to contain key topics within the document set and used to influence a scoring mechanism which prefers sentences touching on these topics.
Wu (2008) also made use of the relative or-dering of events. He assigned complete times-tamps to events extracted from text. After lay-ing out these events onto a timeline by making use of these timestamps, the number of events that happen within the same day is used to influence sentence scoring. The motivation behind this ap-proach is that days which have a large number of events should be more important and more worthy of reporting than others.

These prior works target either 1) sentence re-ordering, or 2) the use of recency as an indicator of saliency. In sentence re-ordering, final summaries are re-arranged so that the extracted sentences that form the summary are in a chronological order. We argue that this may not be appropriate for all summaries. Depending on the style of writing or journalistic guidelines, a summary can arguably be written in a number of ways. The use of recency as an indicator of saliency is useful, yet disregards other accessible temporal information. If a sum-mary of a whole sequence of events is desired, re-cency becomes less useful.

The work of Wu (2008) is closely related to one of the features proposed in this paper. He had also made use of temporal information to weight sen-tences to generate summaries. However his ap-proach is guided by the number of events hap-pening within the same time span, and relies on event co-referencing. In this work, we have sim-plified this idea by dropping the need for event co-referencing (removing a source of propagated er-ror), and augmented it with two additional features derived from timelines. By doing so, we are able to make better use of the available temporal infor-mation, taking into account all known events and the time in which they occur.

A useful note here is that this work is ar-guably different from the Temporal Summariza-tion (TmpSum) track at the Text Retrieval Confer-ence (Aslam et al., 2013). Given a large stream of data in real-time, the purpose of the TmpSum track is to look out for a query event, and retrieve specific details about the event over a period of time. Systems are also expected to identify the source sentences from which these details are re-trieved. This is not the same as our approach here, which makes use of temporal information encoded in timelines to generate prose summaries. To incorporate temporal information into multi-document summarization, we adopt the workflow in Figure 3, which has two key processes: 1) tem-poral processing, and 2) summarization.
 Figure 3: Incorporating temporal information into the SWING summarization pipeline.

Temporal Processing generates timelines from text, one for each input document. Timelines are well-understood constructs which have often been used to represent temporal information (Denis and Muller, 2011; Do et al., 2012). They indicate the temporal relationships between two basic tempo-ral units: 1) events, and 2) time expressions (or timexes for short). In this work, we adopt the definitions proposed in the standardized T IME ML annotation (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a). An event refers to an eventuality, a situation that occurs or an action; while a timex is a reference to a partic-ular date or time (e.g.  X  2013 December 31  X ).
Following the  X  X ivide-and-conquer X  approach described in Verhagen et al. (2010), results from the three temporal processing steps: 1) timex nor-malization, 2) event-timex temporal relationship classification, and 3) event-event temporal rela-tionship classification, are merged to obtain time-lines (top half of Figure 3). We tap on existing systems for each of these steps (Ng and Kan, 2012; Str  X  otgen and Gertz, 2013; Ng et al., 2013).
Summarization. We make use of a state-of-the-art summarization system, SWING (Ng et al., 2012) (bottom half of Figure 3). SWING is a su-pervised, extractive summarization system which ranks sentences based on scores computed using a set of features in the Sentence Scoring phase. The Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algo-rithm is then used in the Sentence Re-ordering phase to re-order and select sentences to form the final summary. The timelines built in the ear-lier temporal processing can be incorporated into this pipeline by deriving a set of features used to score sentences in Sentence Scoring , and as input to the MMR algorithm when computing similarity in Sentence Re-ordering . 3.1 Timelines from Temporal Processing A typical timeline used in this work has been shown earlier in Figure 2. The arrowed, horizon-tal axis is the timeline itself. The timeline can be viewed as a continuum of time, with points on the timeline referring to specific moments of time. Small solid blocks on the timeline itself are ref-erences to absolute timestamps along the timeline (e.g.,  X  2013-Feb-13 11:32 +0000  X  in the figure).
The black square boxes above the timeline de-note events. Events can either occur at a specific instance of time (e.g., an explosion), or over a pe-riod of time (e.g. a football match). Generalizing, we refer to the time period an event takes place in as its time span (vertical dotted lines). As a simpli-Figure 4: A simplified timeline illustrating how the various timeline features can be derived. fying assumption, events are laid out on the time-line based on the starting time of their time span. Note that in our work, time spans may not cor-respond to specific instances of time, but instead help in inferring an ordering of events. Events which appear to the left of others take place ear-lier, while events within the same time span hap-pen together over the same time period. 3.2 Sentence Scoring with Timelines We derive three features from the constructed timelines, which are then used for downstream Sentence Scoring . Figure 4 shows a simplified timeline, along with annotations that are refer-enced in this section to help explain how these timeline features are derived. 1. Time Span Importance (TSI). We hypothe-size that when more events happen within a partic-ular time span, that time span is potentially more relevant for summarization. Sentences that men-tion events found in such a time span should be as-signed higher scores. Referring to Figure 1, whose timeline is shown in Figure 2, we see that the time span with the most number of events is when the latest cyclone made landfall. Assigning higher scores for sentences which contain events in this time span will help us to select more relevant sen-tences if we want a summary about the cyclone.
Let TS L be the time span with the largest num-ber of events in a timeline. The importance of a time span TS i is computed by normalizing the number of events in TS i against the number of events in TS L . The TSI of a sentence s is then the sum of the time span importance associated to all the words in s : where TS w denotes the time span which a word w is associated with, and | TS w | is the number of events within the time span. 2. Contextual Time Span Importance (CTSI). The importance of a time span may not depend solely on the number of events that hap-pen within it. If it is near time spans which are  X  X mportant X  (i.e., one that has a large number of events), it should also be of relative importance. A more concrete illustration of this can also be seen in Figure 1. Sentence (2) explains that a lot of peo-ple have been evacuated prior to the cyclone mak-ing landfall. It is imaginable that this can be use-ful information to be included in a summary, even though from looking at the corresponding timeline in Figure 2, the  X  evacuated  X  event falls in a time span with a low importance score (i.e., the time span only has one event). CTSI seeks to promote sentences such as this.

We derive the CTSI of a sentence by first com-puting the contextual importance of words in the sentence. We define the contextual importance of a word found in time span TS i as a weighted sum of the time span importance of the two nearest peaks TS lp and TS rp found to the left and right of TS i , respectively. In Figure 4, taking reference from event e (shaded in black), the left peak to the time span which e is in happens to be time span A , while the right peak is time span A + 4 . The contribution of each peak to the weighted sum is decayed by its distance from TS i . Formally, the contextual time span importance of a word w can be expressed as: where TS w is the time span associated with w . I lp and I rp are the time span importance of the peaks to the left and right of TS w respectively, while | TS w  X  TS lp | and | TS rp  X  TS w | are the num-ber of time spans between the left and right peaks of TS w respectively.  X  balances the importance of the left and right peaks, intuitively set to 0 . 5 . The CTSI of a sentence is computed as: where E s denotes the set of events words in s . 3. Sentence Temporal Coverage Density (TCD). We first define the temporal coverage of a sentence. This corresponds to the number of time spans that the events in a sentence talk about. Sup-pose a sentence contains events which are associ-ated with time spans TS a , TS b , TS c . The time spans are ordered in the sequence they appear on the timeline. Then the temporal coverage of a sen-tence is defined as the number of time spans be-tween the earliest time span TS a and the latest time span TS c . Referring to Figure 4, suppose a sentence contains the three events which have been shaded black. The temporal coverage in this case includes all the time spans from time span A to time span A + 4 , inclusive.

The constraint on the number of sentences that can be included in a summary requires us to select compact sentences which contain as many rele-vant facts as possible. Traditional lexical measures may attempt to achieve this by computing the ra-tio of keyphrases to the number of words in a sen-tence (Gong and Liu, 2001). Stated equivalently, when two sentences are of the same length, if one contains more keyphrases, it should contain more useful facts. TCD parallels this idea with the use of temporal information, i.e. if two sentences are of the same temporal coverage, then the one with more events should carry more useful facts.
Formally, if a sentence s contains events E s = { e 1 ,...,e n } , where each event is associated with a time span TS i , then TCD is computed using: where | E s | is the number of events found in s , and | TS n  X  TS 1 | is the temporal coverage of s . 3.3 Enhancing MMR with TimeMMR In the sentence re-ordering stage of the SWING pipeline, the iterative MMR algorithm is used to adjust the score of a candidate sentence, s . In each iteration, s is penalized if it is lexically similar to other sentences that have already been selected to form the eventual summary S = { s 1 ,s 2 ,... } . The motivating idea is to reduce repeated information by preferring sentences which bring in new facts.
Incorporating temporal information can poten-tially improve this. In Figure 5, the sentences de-scribe many events which took place within the same time span. They describe the destruction caused by a hurricane with trees uprooted and buildings blown away. A summary about the hur-ricane need not contain all of these sentences as they are all describing the same thing. However it is not trivial for the lexically-motivated MMR algorithm to detect that events like  X  passed  X ,  X  up-rooted  X  or  X  damaged  X  are in fact repetitive.
Thus, we propose further penalizing the score of s if it contains events that happen in similar time spans as those contained in sentences within S . We refer to this as T IME MMR. Modifying the MMR equation from Ng et al. (2012): where Score ( s ) is the score of s , S is the set of sentences already selected to be in the summary from previous iterations, and R 2 is the predicted ROUGE-2 score of s with respect to the already selected sentences ( S ).  X  is a weighting parameter which is empirically set to 0.9 after tuning over a development dataset. T is the proportion of events in s which happen in the same time span as another event in any other sentence in S . Two events are said to be in the same time span if one happens within the time period the other happens in. For example, an event that takes place in  X  2014 June  X  is said to take place within the year  X  2014  X .
While T IME MMR is proposed here as an im-provement over MMR, the premise is that incor-porating temporal information can be helpful to minimize redundancy in summaries. In future work, one could apply it to other state-of-the-art lexical-based approaches including that of Hen-drickx et al. (2009) and Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur (2010). We also believe the same idea can be transplanted even to non-lexical motivated tech-niques such as the corpus-based similarity mea-sure proposed by Xie and Liu (2008). We chose to use MMR here as a proof-of-concept to demon-strate the viability of such a technique, and to eas-ily integrate our work into SWING . 3.4 Gauging Usefulness of Timelines Temporal processing is imperfect. Together with the simplifying assumptions that were made in timeline construction, our generated timelines have errors which propagate into the summariza-tion process. With this in mind, we selectively em-ploy timelines to generate summaries only when we are confident of their accuracy. This can be done by computing a metric which can be used to decide whether or not timelines should be used for a particular input document collection. We refer to this as reliability filtering .

We postulate that the length of a timeline can serve as a simple reliability filtering metric. The intuition for this is that for longer timelines (which contain more events), possible errors are spread over the entire timeline, and do not overpower any useful signal that can be obtained from the time-line features outlined earlier. Errors are however time. very easily propagated into summary generation for shorter timelines, leading to less useful results.
We incorporate this into our process as follows: given an input document collection (which con-sists of 10 documents), the average size of all the timelines for each of these 10 documents is com-puted. Only when this value is larger than a thresh-old value are the timelines used. The proposed timeline features and T IME MMR were implemented on top of SWING , and eval-uated on the test documents from TAC-2011 (Owczarzak and Dang, 2011). SWING makes use of three generic features and two features targeted specifically at guided summarization. Since the focus of this paper is on multi-document summa-rization, we employ only the three generic fea-tures, i.e., 1) sentence position, 2) sentence length, and 3) interpolated n-gram document frequency in our experiments below. Summarization evalua-tion is done using ROUGE-2 (R-2) (Lin and Hovy, 2003), as it has previously been shown to correlate well with human assessment (Lin, 2004) and is of-ten used to evaluate automatic text summarization.
The results obtained are shown in Table 1. In the table, each row refers to a specific summariza-tion system configuration. We also show the re-sults of two reference systems, CLASSY (Conroy et al., 2011) and POLYCOM (Zhang et al., 2011), as benchmarks. CLASSY and POLYCOM are top performing systems at TAC-2011 (ranked 2nd and 3rd by R-2 in TAC 2011, respectively; the full ver-sion of SWING was ranked 1st with a R-2 score of 0.1380). From these results, we can see that SWING is a very competitive baseline.

Rows 9 to 16 additionally incorporate our time-line reliability filtering. We assume that the var-ious input document sets to be summarized are available at the time of processing. Hence in these experiments, the threshold for filtering is set to be the average of all the timeline sizes over the whole input dataset. In a production environment where this assumption may not hold, this threshold could Table 1: R-2 scores after incorporating temporal information into SWING .  X ** X  and  X * X  denotes sig-nificant differences with respect to Row R (paired one-tailed Student X  X  t -test; p &lt; 0 . 05 and p &lt; 0 . 1 respectively), and TMMR denotes T IME MMR. be set by empirical tuning over a development set.
Row 1 shows the usefulness of the proposed timeline-based features. A statistically significant improvement of 4.1% is obtained with the use of all three features over SWING . When we use re-liability filtering (Row 9), this improvement in-creases to 5.9%.

The ablation test results in Rows 2 to 4 show a drop in R-2 each time a feature is left out. With the exception of Row 4, removing a feature lessens the improvement in R-2 to be insignificant from SWING  X  X . The same drop occurs even when reli-ability filtering is used (Rows 9 to 12). These in-dicate that all the proposed features are important and need to be used together to be effective.
Rows 5 to 8 and Rows 13 to 16 show the ef-fect of T IME MMR. While the results do not uni-formly show that T IME MMR is effective, it can be helpful, such as when comparing Rows 2 and 6, or Rows 10 and 14, where R-2 improves marginally.
Looking at Rows 1 to 8, and Rows 9 to 16, we see the importance of reliability filtering. It is able to guide the use of timelines such that significant improvements in R-2 over SWING are obtained. To help visualize what the differences in these ROUGE scores mean, Figure 7 shows two sum-TAC-2011 dataset. The left one is produced by the configuration in Row 9, and the right one is pro-duced by SWING without the use of any temporal information. Figure 6: Breakdown of raw feature scores for sen-tences ( L 2) and ( R 2) from Figure 7.

The higher R-2 score obtained by the summary on the left (0.0873) compared to the one on the right (0.0723) suggests that temporal information can help to identify salient sentences more accu-rately. A closer look at sentences ( L 2) and ( R 2) and their R-2 scores (0.0424 and 0.0249, respec-tively) is instructive. Figure 6 shows the raw fea-ture scores of both sentences. Both sentences score similarly for the SWING features of sen-tence position (SP), sentence length (Length), and interpolated n-gram document frequency (INDF); however, the scores for all three timeline features higher for ( L 2) than ( R 2). This helps our time sen-sitive system prefer ( L 2). We now examine the proposed 1) timeline fea-tures, 2) T IME MMR algorithm, and 3) reliabil-ity filtering metric in greater detail to gain insight into their efficacy. For the analysis on timeline features, we only present an analysis for TSI and CTSI due to space constraints.

Time Span Importance. Figure 8 shows the last sentences from a pair of summaries generated with and without the use of TSI (all other sen-tences were the same). The original articles de-scribe an accident where casualties were suffered when a crane toppled onto a building. It is easy to see why ( L 1) scores higher for R-2  X  it describes the cause of the accident just as it occurred. ( R 1) however talks about events which happened before the accident itself (e.g., how much of the tower had already been erected). In this case time span im-portance is able to correctly guide summary gen-eration by favoring time spans containing events related to the actual toppling.

Contextual Time Span Importance. CTSI recognizes that events which happen around the time of a big cluster of other events can be im-portant too. The benefits of this feature can be clearly seen in Figure 9. The summary on the left achieved a R-2 score of 0.1215 while the one on the right achieved 0.0861. ( L 2) and ( L 3) were both boosted by the use of the contextual impor-tance feature.

Figure 10 shows an extract of the timeline gen-erated for the source document from which ( L 3) is extracted. The two events inside ( L 3) fall in time spans A and B marked in the figure. Their proximity to the peak P between them gives the sentence a higher score for CTSI. This boost re-sults in the sentence being selected for inclusion in the final summary. It turns out that this sentence was lifted exactly in one of the model summaries for this document set, resulting in a very good R-2 score when contextual importance is used. Figure 10: Extract of timeline generated for doc-ument APW ENG 20070615.0356 from the TAC-2011 dataset.

Is T IME MMR Useful? The experimental re-sults do not conclusively affirm the usefulness of T
IME MMR. However we believe it is because the ROUGE measures that are used for evalua-tion are not suited for this purpose. Recall that T
IME MMR seeks to eliminate redundancy based on time span similarities and not lexical likeness. ROUGE, however, measures the latter.

An interesting case in point is given in Fig-ure 11. The summary on the left is generated using T IME MMR and achieved a lower ROUGE score. The one on the right is generated with-out T IME MMR and scores higher, suggesting that T
IME MMR is not helpful. The key difference in the two summaries is ( R 3). ( L 3) is the equivalent of ( R 4), while ( L 4) is the full version of the trun-cated ( R 5). T IME MMR penalizes ( R 3). ( R 3) re-ports that the shoe-throwing incident happened as the U.S. President Bush appeared together with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. However their joint appearance is already reported in ( R 1) (and similarly ( L 1)). ( R 3) repeats what had been presented earlier. Since ( R 1) and ( R 3) talk about the same time span, T IME MMR down-weights ( R 3). We argue that this is better even though the ROUGE scores indicate otherwise. In future work it will be worthwhile to consider the use of metrics like Pyramid (Passonneau et al., 2005) which are less bound to superficial lexicons.

Reliability Filtering. Table 2 shows the ef-fect of varying the filtering threshold on R-2 for the best performing configuration from Table 1 (i.e., SWING +TSI+CTSI+TCD). The result ob-tained in Row 9 using a threshold of 42.68 is also re-produced for reference. T =0 means that time-lines are used for all input document sets, whereas T =100 means that no timelines are used, as the length of the longest timeline is less than 100.
As the threshold increases from 0 to 40 X 50, summarization performance improves while the Table 2: Effect of different reliability filtering thresholds for SWING +TSI+CTSI+TCD.  X  T  X  is the threshold used;  X  #  X  is the number of input col-lections (out of 44) where timelines are used;  X ** X  and  X * X  is statistical significance over SWING of p &lt; 0 . 05 and p &lt; 0 . 1 , respectively. number of document sets where temporal informa-tion is used is reduced. This suggests that filtering is successful in identifying timelines that are not sufficiently accurate to be useful for summariza-tion. R-2 performance peaks around a threshold of 40. This affirms our use of the average length of timelines as the threshold value in our earlier experiments. Beyond 60, the R-2 scores are still higher than that obtained by SWING , but no longer significantly different. At these higher thresholds, temporal information is still able to help get an im-provement in R-2. However as this affects only very few out of the 44 document sets, statistical variances mean that these R-2 scores are no longer significant from that produced by SWING . We have shown in this work how temporal in-formation in the form of timelines can be incor-porated into multi-document summarization. We achieve this through two means, using: 1) three novel features derived from timelines to mea-sure the saliency of sentences, and 2) T IME MMR which considers time span similarity to enhance the traditional MMR X  X  lexical diversity measure.
To overcome errors propagated from the under-lying temporal processing systems, we proposed a reliability filtering metric which can be used to help decide when temporal information should be used for summarization. The use of this metric leads to an overall 5.9% gain in R-2 over the com-petitive SWING baseline.

In future work, we are keen to study our pro-posed timeline-related features more intrinsically in the context of human-generated summaries. This can help us better understand their value in improving content selection. As noted earlier, it will be also be useful to repeat our experi-ments with less lexicon-influenced measures like the Pyramid method (Passonneau et al., 2005). Manual assessment of the generated summaries can also be done to give a better picture of the quality of the summaries generated with the use of timelines. Finally, given the importance of re-liability filtering, a natural question is if there are other metrics that can be used to get better results.
