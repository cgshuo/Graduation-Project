To receive the word distributions that describe the K available topics, draw each topic being a Dirichlet prior with parameters  X  . 2.

The type of knowledge integrated via o can be manifold. One possibility is to specify knowledge like topic 2  X  , with topic 2 being e.g.  X  finance  X  . This would be stated with the following rule:  X 
Z ( i , t ) is true iff the hidden topic z i = t .  X 
W ( i , v ) is true iff word w i = v .  X  D ( i , j ) is true iff d i = j .
