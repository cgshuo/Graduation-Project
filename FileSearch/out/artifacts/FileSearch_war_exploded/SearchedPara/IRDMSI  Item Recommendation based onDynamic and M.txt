 In order to predict whether a user will like an item, we have to understand the tastes of the user as well as understand how these properties change over time. While users often like items which their friends are interested in, it is important to consider social influence between users into recommender systems. In fact, users X  social interactions are also dynamic in the real world. For example, when users make new friends with others, most users will have frequent interactions at first. But as time flies, the interactions will decrease and then the relationship will have little influence on users X  behaviors.
 showed that it can be evaluated by three different mechanisms that cause users to conform to others. That means that users can be influenced by various di-mensions. Firstly, it may be individual status. For example, in Facebook, users usually like to read articles which their friends or relatives are fond of. Secondly, it may be peer influence. To specific, users often read the papers which the supe-rior leaders or colleagues shared. Thirdly, it may be group pressure. In fact, users often participate in some groups and have frequent interactions among groups. These interactions will help users to find some items which they like. motivate different models for temporal dynamics in recommender systems. Our goal in this paper is to propose a novel model which is item recommendation based on dynamic and multi-dimensional social influence, namely IRDMSI, by combing such mechanisms in order to explore hidden social influence evolution and improve recommendation performance.

 ship between users in recommender systems, or they just used time information and ignored the useful social relationship in recommender systems. Few attempt-s have studied multi-dimensional social influence in recommender systems and how users X  tastes and social influence change over time. In this paper, a prob-abilistic graph model is proposed to combine multi-dimensional social influence and time information to recommend items which a user will like and explore the evolution of social influence. The very act of users X  interactions will cause the us-er X  X  tastes to change. The probabilistic graph model shows superior performance of inference. It achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models. mendation performance with following contributions. Firstly, we try to formalize social influence through multi-dimension and explore its dynamic evolution; sec-ondly we propose a new latent factor model IRDMSI to consider dynamic and multi-dimensional social influence into recommender systems; finally we conduct our experiments on two different datasets. Experimental results indicate differ-ent datasets applied with the proposed IRDMSI model, which can achieve good performance.
 definition is briefly introduced; Section 3 proposes our model  X  IRDMSI, which extends the latent factor model to combine multi-dimensional social influence and time information within the probabilistic model; our approach outperforms several baseline algorithms and the experimental results are presented in Section 4; finally the conclusion and future work are in Section 5.
 Suppose there is a network G = ( U; V; E ), where U is a set of | U | = N users, V is a set of | V | = M items and E  X  U  X  U is a set of relationship between users. Let R  X  R N  X  M  X  T denotes rating, where R uvt is the rating of user u on item v at time t and we mark zero if there is no rating history. We further assume that users in a network form p groups and use N  X  p matrix C to represent users X  group memberships. Specifically, each element c uk  X  C is a binary value, which represents whether user u belongs to the k th group. And C k represents the k th group. The group can be formed through users X  interactions. We use a community detection algorithm [10] to detect groups from the users X  network. Given this, we describe notations used in this paper in Table 1.
 impact on users X  tastes and then how to recommend a list of items that users will be interested in. Fig.1 (a) shows different dimensional users X  social relationship in a network. Here, we firstly define social influence from individual status, peer influence and group pressure.
 is influenced by one of her friend u  X  over the total number of rating behaviors by user u . More precisely we define: where R t u  X  R denotes the rating history of user u at time t and " is a threshold of difference between the time when the two users u and u  X  both rated the same item v , and | X | denotes the cardinality over a set.
 is influenced by a particular friend u  X  .
 social influence that the user u conforms to her particular friend u  X  over the total number of rating behaviors by the friend u  X  . Here we define: from groups that the user belongs to. In a group, there may be a large number of rating behaviors performed by its users. However, many behaviors may be made by several users, so we first define the -group rating behavior as the valid history that was made by more than a proportion of of all users in the group C k . Given this, we can define the group pressure as follows: social influence that the user u gets from the group over the total number of -group rating behaviors by users in the group C k . where R C portion of all users in the group C k . And I [ c uk ] is an indicator function, which equals true if the value of c uk is 1 and false otherwise.
 observed rating and R u;v =? represents the unobserved rating. So our recom-mendation goal is to predict the unobserved rating according to the observed rating history and then recommend a list of items for users according to rating. Our goal is to design a new framework to model social influence from different dimensions and mine users X  hidden dynamic tastes, then predict a list of items that the user will be interested in. We propose IRDMSI, a recommendation model by employing dynamic and multi-dimensional social influence. The idea of our approach is to predict rating information with probabilistic latent factors. And it incorporates with social influence and time information. Therefore, the problem transforms 2-dimension matrix factorization into 3-dimension ParaFac decomposition [1]. Assuming U  X  R F  X  N , V  X  R F  X  M , T  X  R F  X  L , Z  X  R F  X  N respectively denote the latent user feature, item feature, time feature and social factor feature, where R represents rating behaviors of users on items. In fact, S = { s iql } reflects the set of social relationship. By combining above three different dimensional social influence, we firstly define the social influence which user i gets at time l as follows: according to various aspects of social influence.
 graphical representation of our approach (IRDMSI). We can see that the rating is generated from user latent feature vector U i , item lant feature vector V j and time information latent feature vector T l . And user X  X  social relationship is similar with user X  X  rating information and generated from U i , Z q and T l . bution. They can be defined as: where N ( x | ; 2 ) is the probability density function of the Gaussian distribution with mean and variance 2 .
 where I r ijl is the indicator function that equals 1 if user i has rating behavior on item j at time l and equals 0 otherwise. The posterior distribution over user, item and time features are given as where I s iql is the indicator function that equals 1 if user i has social relationship with user q at time l and equals 0 otherwise. The posterior distribution over the user, social relationship and time features is given as features is written as p ( U; V; Z; T; T 0 | S; R; 2 S ; 2 U ; 2 Z ; 2 T ; 2 0 )  X  p ( U; V; T; T squared-errors objective function with quadratic regularization terms, and sim-plify as latent feature vectors until convergence, finally use all latent features to predict rating information. In this section, we first evaluate our proposed IRDMSI to show the benefit of exploiting the three dimensions of social influence. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IRDMSI compared with other social recommenda-tion methods. Finally we analyze the change of social influence over time and make dynamic recommendation for users. 4.1 Experimental Settings Data Sets. In our paper, experiments are performed on two data sets: Epinions and AMiner 1 . Epinions is knowledge sharing and review site, in which users can rate items, connect to others. This means Epinions include rating information, social relationships and time information. AMiner consists of many papers over 12 years which can be considered as items. We can see authors as users. Users X  social relationship are the collaboration relationship of authors. Authors often cite their interested papers, which can be seen as rating behaviors. If an author (user) cites a paper (item), the corresponding rating record counts 1. Then these datasets all contain information of users, items, time and social relationship. Table 2 shows the statistic information of the datasets.
 Baseline Algorithms. We compare our approach with the following methods. The popularity of item decides the position of the item at the list. Although the method is simple, it also has good recommendation performance, because many users often prefer to like the popular items.

 Performance Metrics.
 rics: RMSE, NDCG and Pre@k. Among these, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE ) can be given as [6]: where r ij denotes the rating which user i gave to item j , b r ij denotes the rating which user i gave to item j as predicted by our approach, and T N denotes the number of the testing ratings. information retrieval. After getting the predicted rating matrix by using our model, we can rank the predicted rating and get a list of recommended items for each user. Here we define the value of NDCG at the first k position as [13]: where x ji is the label when the item v j is at position i. If item v j can be observed by users, x ji equals 1 and 0 otherwise. And Z is the normalization factor. If the value of NDCG is higher, it shows that the ranking performance is better. In experiments, we set k as the length of the list of recommended items. defines as [16]: where hists@k represents the correct items in the set of top-k items. And k means the length of recommended items. In our experiments, we set k as 5. 4.2 Result Analysis Our proposed model has several parameters. The parameter settings of this paper are U = V = Z = T = 0 : 001, S = 0 : 5. The number of latent factors F is 10. And the learning rate in Gradient Descent is 0.001. The results are given in Table 3.
 each dataset, we randomly select x% as the training set and the remaining 1-x% as the testing set. And we vary x as 70, 80 in this paper. We compare the proposed model with other baseline algorithms.
 better than other baseline algorithms on all datasets. On Epinions, when the training set is 70%, our proposed model IRDMSI outperfoms SocialMF which gets the best performance in baseline algorithms by 0.006 in terms of RMSE. As for NDCG, the figure gets an increase of 0.008. Although the Pre@5 is very small, our model still gets better performance than other methods and the performance increases by 0.003. And when the training data is 80%, the performance of different methods all get better performance than them by using smaller training data. Respectively, our model IRDMSI can decrease RMSE by 0.009 comparing with SocialMF. Similarly, NDCG gets a higher value by a rising of 0.017. And Pre@5 rises by 0.009. Besides, on AMiner, we can get similar results like Epinions. Furthermore, AMiner can get better performance on all evaluation metrics than Epinions. Because the rating density of AMiner is smaller than Epinions, AMiner can employ more coherent rating records which lead to better prediction. influence which affects the performance in terms of NDCG and Pre@5. Fig.3 shows the comparison performance of our proposed model IRDMSI by consider-ing different dimensions of social influence. IRDM SI base represents the IRDMSI method by considering only basic features and ignore all social relationship. It can be clearly seen that without these social influence factors, the recommenda-tion performance decreases to some extent. Because the social relationship den-sity is small in both two datasets, the comparison performance is not significant. IRDM SI base +I (or +P or +G) respectively indicates that we respectively add individual status features (or peer influence features or group pressure features) into IRDM SI base method. By incorporating each dimension of social influence factors, we observe clear improvement compared to the IRDM SI base method. s. We randomly select some users from datasets and get the evolution according to time. From Fig.4, it can be seen that in both two datasets there are approx-imately three kinds of typical users. One kind is at first highly influenced by social networks and easily conforms to others, but the social influence which he gets becomes little when time flies. The second kind is that they often get relatively stable social influence in the network to some extent. And the final kind has an opposite trend by comparing with the first one. It also demonstrate that the social influence is dynamic and it is necessary to consider its dynamics in recommender systems. In this paper, we propose a novel model to recommend items for users. We employ latent factors and put forward a novel probabilistic model IRDMSI by incorporating multi-dimensional social influence and time information. Then we analyze the dynamic change of social influence over time and make more precise recommendation. Finally, the model achieves better performance by comparing to other models. As for the future work, it would be interesting to mine the change trend of social influence and predict users X  sentiment trend, which will be helpful to recommender systems. Another direction is to consider the change of item information over time and makes more accurate personalized recommen-dation.
