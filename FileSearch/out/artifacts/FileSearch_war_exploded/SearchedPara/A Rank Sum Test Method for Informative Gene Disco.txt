 { Finding informative genes from microarray data is an impor-tant research problem in bioinformatics research and appli-cations. Most of the existing methods rank features accord-ing to their discriminative capability and then find a subset of discriminative genes (usually top k genes). In particu-lar, t -statistic criterion and its variants have been adopted extensively. This kind of methods rely on the statistics prin-ciple of t -test, which requires that the data follows a normal distribution. However, according to our investigation, the normality condition often cannot be met in real data sets.
To avoid the assumption of the normality condition, in this paper, we propose a rank sum test method for informa-tive gene discovery. The method uses a rank-sum statistic as the ranking criterion. Moreover, we propose using the signif-icance level threshold, instead of the number of informative genes, as the parameter. The significance level threshold as a parameter carries the quality specification in statistics. We follow the Pitman efficiency theory to show that the rank sum method is more accurate and more robust than the t -statistic method in theory.

To verify the effectiveness of the rank sum method, we use  X  This research is supported in part by Research Grant Council, Hong Kong SAR, China, under grant num-ber HKUST6225/02E, National Science Foundation of the United States under grant number IIS-0308001, and Na-tional Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60071004.

 support vector machine (SVM) to construct classifiers based on the identified informative genes on two well known data sets, namely colon data and leukemia data. The prediction accuracy reaches 96 . 2% on the colon data and 100% on the leukemia data. The results are clearly better than those from the previous feature ranking methods. By experiments, we also verify that using significance level threshold is more effective than directly specifying an arbitrary k .

The DNA microarray technology enables rapid, large-scale screening for patterns of gene expression. A DNA microar-ray experiment can provide simultaneous, semi-quantitative readouts on expression levels for thousands of genes [3]. The raw microarray data is transformed into gene expression ma-trices. Figure 1 shows an example. Usually, a row in the matrix represents a gene and a column represents a sample. The numeric value in each cell characterizes the expression level of a specific gene in a particular sample. Many data sets are now available on the web (e.g., [19, 2, 8]).
In many microarrary data sets, the samples can be di-vided into several subgroups, such as tumor tissues and nor-mal tissues (cases and controls). Each subgroup is called a phenotype . A critical task is to identify the informative genes  X  the genes that are discriminative among different phenotypes. To elaborate, suppose there are 8 samples in a data set. Among them, 4 samples are tumor tissues and the other 4 samples are normal tissues, as shown in Figure 2. The expression levels of 5 genes are illustrated. Genes g g and g 3 are informative, since they are more or less con-sistent within each phenotype, and discriminative between the two phenotypes. On the other hand, genes g 4 and g 5 are non-informative genes, since they cannot manifest any difference between the two phenotypes.

There are often thousands of genes in a data set, but prob-ably only a small subset of genes are highly related to the phenotypes under investigation. Therefore, the discovery of informative genes as feature selection from an extremely high dimensional space has broad applications. For exam-ple, to construct an effective classifier for tumor diagnosis, the informative genes should be used. The non-informative genes should be filtered out so that the classification can avoid noises. Moreover, informative genes can also provide insights into the causes of phenotypes. The investigation on the informative genes may further indicate the inherent fac-tors that lead to the differences between the cases (e.g., the tumor tissues) and the controls (e.g., the normal tissues), or between different subtypes of tumor tissues.

One may think, given a set of labeled samples, finding the informative genes may be straightforward. We only need to find the genes that are consistent within each phenotype and very different between the phenotypes. Unfortunately, the cases are far from that simple. The real microarray data sets are always very noisy. Almost no gene is perfectly consistent in each phenotype and sharply different between phenotypes. Instead, from the very noisy data, we have to find out the genes that are very likely to be informative.
The problem of informative gene discovery has been stud-ied extensively in the last 5 years. It has become increasingly clear that, for many data analysis tasks on microarray data such as classification and clustering, instead of considering many genes, it is effective to consider a small number of in-formative genes [15]. To select informative genes, a ranking criterion is often introduced to quantify the discriminative capability of individual genes. Then, a subset of genes with the highest ranking criterion values are selected as infor-mative genes. This kind of methods are known as feature ranking methods .

Although several ranking criteria have been proposed, there exist two serious problems. First, many methods require a user-specified threshold on the number of informative genes. That is, they select the top k genes as the informative ones. However, it is often hard for a user to specify such a pa-rameter. Second, some methods use the t -statistic or its variations as the selection criteria. The t -statistic requires that the data follows the Gaussian (normal) distribution. According to our investigation (see Section 3), the assump-tion about the data distribution often does not hold in gene expression data.

In this paper, we propose a novel ranking criterion for in-formative gene discovery based on non-parametric testing. In particular, we use rank sum test. By non-parametric test-ing, we do not assume any specific data distribution in gene expression data. Moreover, we use the significance level to select informative genes and thus provide the quality guar-antee in statistics. To verify the effectiveness of our new method for informative gene discovery, we construct the sup-port vector machine (SVM) classifiers using the identified informative genes. Our experimental results on two well known real data sets, the colon data set and the leukemia data set, show that the rank sum test method is effective: the SVM-based classifiers using the informative genes so identified are clearly more accurate than the previous meth-ods.

The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. In Sec-tion 2, we describe the informative gene discovery problem concisely and review the related work. The rank sum test method is introduced in Section 3. The experimental results are reported in Section 4. Section 5 discusses related issues and Section 6 concludes the paper.
In this section, we describe the problem of informative gene discovery, and present a brief review of the related work.
In general, for a set of genes G and a set of samples S , a microarray data set can be modeled as a two dimensional matrix M =( m i,j ) n  X  m ,where m i,j is the expression level of gene g i on sample s j .

Often, the microarray tests are conducted on controlled groups of samples. That is, the samples can be divided into certain groups (called phenotypes), such as the groups of normal tissues and tumor tissues. Typically, a sample has thousands of genes and there are only less than 100 samples in a microarray data set. Typical data analysis tasks on microarray data sets include classification, clustering and pattern discovery.

If we treat each sample as an object and each gene as a feature/dimension, the data analysis is in a very high di-mensional space with thousands of dimensions. As indicated by previous studies, data analysis in such high dimensional spaces is usually ineffective and deficient. Therefore, it is de-sirable to select a small subset of genes such that each gene is discriminative among the subgroups of samples. Such genes are called informative genes .

Previous studies strongly indicate that the number of in-formative genes is usually much smaller than the total num-ber of genes. Data analysis using informative genes is effec-tive and efficient.

Now, the problem becomes how we can discover the infor-mative genes effectively .Thisiscalledthe informative gene discovery problem .
Most of the existing informative gene selection methods are based on feature ranking. A typical approach is in two steps. First, a ranking criterion is defined to measure the variance of the expression values in different phenotypes for each gene. Then, the top-k genes with the best ranking measure values are selected as the informative genes. In particular, the t -statistic ranking criterion and its variants are frequently used [1, 4, 7, 9, 17, 18].
 The t -statistic [1] is defined as where and  X  i, + ,  X  i,  X  ,  X  i, + and  X  i,  X  are the mean and standard deviation of gene g i on the positive and negative samples, respectively; n + and n  X  are the number of samples in the positive and negative classes, respectively.

Intuitively, the t -statistic measures the difference of means between different phenotypes, and the difference is normal-ized by an expression of variances. Actually, the t -statistic is used to measure the difference between two Gaussian dis-tributions. Based on the t -test theory, when the data follows Gaussian distribution, we can also compute the p -values to know how significant the difference is. Then, we can use the significance level, which is a threshold of p -values, to determine a set of informative genes [4].

Some simplified forms of t -statistic are also used as rank-ing criteria. For example, Golub et al. [9] propose the fol-lowing measure where  X  i, + ,  X  i,  X  ,  X  i, + and  X  i,  X  are the mean and standard deviation of gene g i on the positive and negative samples, respectively. This ranking criterion is also adopted in other studies [7, 18]. As another example, Pavlidis et al. [17] adapt the Fisher X  X  discriminant criterion (FDC) [5], and define a criterion as These two criteria have similar formulas as the t -statistic. They are considered as variants of the t -statistic.
The t -statistic like methods take the assumption that the data follows the Gaussian distribution . However, if the as-sumption does not hold, two defections of the t -statistic criterion may happen. First, the ranks of the genes may not concur with their discriminative capabilities over phe-notypes. Second, using significance level to determine the informative genes may become meaningless in statistics. A detailed discussion will follow in Section 3.1.

Some methods other than the t -statistic exist. For exam-ple, the square ratio is used by Dudoit et al. [6]. Moreover, Guyon et al. [11] propose a method that selects informative genes according to their utilization to SVM classifier. The method conducts the recursive feature elimination (RFE) based on a linear SVM classifier. A recent work by Yu et al. extends the RFE method to a polynomial-SVM [21]. However, selecting informative genes by a specific classifier may  X  X verfit X  the classifier and thus may not be helpful for other applications. A gene selection method independent from specific analysis will have more extensive applications. Moreover, the accuracy of the SVM classifier may not be an intuitive and direct indicator for the quality of informative genes.
In this section, we develop our rank sum test method. We first discuss why the rank sum test is introduced. Then, we revisit the general idea of rank sum test, and explain how it can be used in informative gene discovery.
A statistical test is used to determine the statistical sig-nificance of an observation. With an assumption of the un-derlying distribution of the observed data, a parametric test can be conducted.

T -test [10] is a typical parametric test. The t -statistic ranking criterion is derived from the t -test, which is used to test whether two Gaussian populations have different distri-butions in statistics. For gene selection, a high variance of distribution in different phenotypes indicates that the gene has a strong capability of discriminating different pheno-types.

Now, the key problem becomes,  X  Does the gene expression data often follow the Gaussian distribution?  X 
We use three well-known real data sets, Colon cancer data set [2], Breast cancer data set [19] and Leukemia data set [8], to test if they follow the Gaussian distribution. We use the Skewness and Kurtosis statistics to conduct the normality test. The null hypothesis is that a gene satisfies the normal-ity condition. We choose a significance level of 0 . 05. If the null hypothesis of a gene is rejected, then the gene cannot be considered to follow the normal distribution. The error rate of mis-rejecting a gene that actually satisfies the normality condition is smaller than the significance level of 0 . 05.
The results are shown in Table 1. As can be seen, nearly half of the genes X  null hypotheses are rejected. Even for those genes whose null hypotheses are not rejected, they still may not follow the Gaussian distribution.

From this test, it is clear that the three data sets do not satisfy the normality condition. The three data sets are typical. In general, the gene expression data may not satisfy the normality condition.

Can we still use the t -statistic if the gene expression does not follow a Gaussian distribution ? Generally, the t -statistic still can loosely measure the difference of the distributions between the phenotypes. However, it does not work as well as when the normality condition holds. As discussed be-fore, there are two problems when the normality condition is violated. First, the order of genes in t -statistic may not reflect their capabilities of discriminating phenotypes. For instance, suppose a gene A follows the normal distribution, and a gene B follows a uniform distribution within an in-terval. Then, the t -statistic value of gene A can be larger than that of gene B . Consequently, gene A ranks higher than gene B . This may lead to an error in informative gene selection. The key is that the p -value of gene B should be calculated under the assumption of uniform distribution in-stead of normal distribution . Then, gene B mayrankhigher than gene A according to their p -values. In short, blindly applying t -statistic to gene expression data that does not follow a Gaussian distribution may lead to a wrong order of genes.

Furthermore, if the normality condition is violated, the t -statistic will not follow the t -distribution any more. So we should not get the p -value of a gene from the t -distribution table, that is, using the significance level to select the infor-mative genes does not make sense in statistics any more.
When the underlying distribution of data is unknown, a non-parametric test should be conducted. The Pitman ef-ficiency theory [16], which is also called asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) theory, gives a good explanation on the advantage of the non-parametric method when the normal-ity condition is violated. Here, we review the basic ideas of the Pitman efficiency.

In statistic test, two types of errors may happen.
The probability of the type I errors is just the significance level, while the probability of the type II errors is equal to one subtract the power X  X he probability of rejecting the null hypothesis correctly.

Generally, a statistic test is good if it has relatively small probabilities of both type I and type II errors. Given a cer-tain number of samples, there is usually a tradeoff between the probability of type I errors and that of type II errors. When the sample size is growing to infinity, both probabili-ties can approach to 0.

Suppose  X  and  X  are the probabilities of type I errors and type II errors, respectively. For any statistical test T ,there exists a large enough sample size N such that T satisfies the given  X  and  X  . The relative efficiency RE ( A,B )isdefined as N B N A ,where N A and N B are the sample sizes required for test A and B to give the same accuracy in terms of  X  and  X  , respectively.

RE ( A,B ) &gt; 1 means that test A is more accurate than test B . However, RE ( A,B ) is influenced by many factors and is difficult to compute. So the asymptotic relative effi-ciency ARE ( A,B ) is usually used, which is the limitation of RE ( A,B )when  X  is fixed and  X  is approaching 0, as an ob-jective criterion to compare the efficiencies of different tests in statistics. It is proved that ARE ( A,B ) provides a good approximation of RE ( A,B ) [16] even with a small data set size.

The Wilcoxon rank sum test [14, 20] is a non-parametric alternative to the two-sample t -test. So, we are concerned about ARE ( W,t ), which is the asymptotic relative efficiency of Wilcoxon rank sum test to t -test. If we use f ( x )torep-resent the underlying distribution function of the data, and use  X  2 to represent its variance, then it can be shown [16] that, generally, Table 2 shows some concrete ARE ( W,t ) values for some common distributions. When the data follows the Gaussian distribution perfectly, the t -test is a bit superior to Wilcoxon Total # of genes 2000 2000 5776 5776 7129 7129  X  X LL X  for a cute l ymphoblastic l eukemia.) rank sum test. However, when the data follows some other distributions, the Wilcoxon rank sum test is much better than the t -test.

Table 3 shows an example of the ARE ( W,t ) values, when normal population is partly contaminated. The standard normal distribution  X ( x ) is contaminated with a different scale normal distribution  X ( x/ 3), the contaminated portion is  X  . The contaminated distribution function is In Table 3, we can see only contaminated portion 0 . 15 makes the t -test much worse than Wilcoxon rank sum test. Gen-erally, under different situations, the ARE ( W,t )valuevaries in the interval [0 . 864 , +  X  ]. Thus, in most cases, the Wilcoxon rank sum test is superior to the t -test. For gene selection problem, the superiority means that the selected genes are more reliable in terms of having different distributions in different phenotypes. Therefore, it is more reasonable and reliable to use the rank sum test method for gene selection rather than the t -statistic method. Table 3: The ARE ( W,t ) values for contaminated nor-mal distribution F  X  ( x )=(1  X   X  ) X ( x )+  X   X ( x/ 3) .
When the data does not follow a normal distribution, a distribution free non-parametric test should be conducted. The rank sum test is a big category of non-parametric tests. The general idea is that, instead of using the original ob-served data, we can list the data in the value ascending or-der, and assign each data item a rank , which is the place of the item in the sorted list. Then, the ranks are used in the analysis. Using the ranks instead of the original observed data makes the rank sum test much less sensitive to outliers and noises than the classical (parametric) tests. An outlier will change the t -statistic value greatly, but not much to the ranks. A gene expression data set often has many outliers and noises. Thus, it is more suitable to apply the rank sum test on informative gene selection.

Depending on the number of classes in the data sets, we have different kinds of rank sum tests. The Wilcoxon rank sum test [20, 14] is a non-parametric alternative to the two-samples t -test. The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test is used for multi-class testing.
 In this paper, we focus on the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Given a data set of two classes. The statistic W is the sum of ranks of the samples in the smaller class. The major steps of the Wilcoxon rank sum test are as follows. 1. Combine all observations from the two populations 2. Add all the ranks associated with the observations 3. Finally, the p -value associated with the Wilcoxon statis-The method is demonstrated as follows.

Example 1 (Wilcoxon rank sum test). Suppose X and Y are the expression levels of a certain gene in normal and tumor samples, respectively. The normal set X contains 12 observed values and the tumor set Y contains 7 observed values, as shown in Table 4. We want to test whether null hypothesis P ( X&gt;Y )= P ( X&lt;Y ) holds, which means the distribution in normal samples is identical to the distribu-tion in tumor samples.

We combine all the samples in X and Y ,andsortthem in the value ascending order. The ranks are assigned to samples based on the order. If k samples have the same value of rank i , then each of them has an average rank The results are shown in Table 5.

Let n 1 and n 2 be the numbers of samples in the smaller and larger groups, respectively. The tumor set has a smaller sample size, 7, so n 1 = 7 and n 2 = 12. Then, we compute the sums of the tumor ranks and have the statistic W = 1+3+4+6+8 . 5 + 11 + 16 = 49 . 5.

If null hypothesis H : P ( X&gt;Y )= P ( X&lt;Y ) holds, then the statistic W should be around the expectation value If the value of W is either too large or too small, the null hypothesis is likely to be false. Using the Matlab, the p -value is computed as 0 . 0873. Thus, if we set the significance level  X  is 0 . 05 &lt; 0 . 0873, the null hypothesis H 0 cannot be rejected; but if we set the significance level  X  is 0 . 1 &gt; 0 . 0873, then the null hypothesis H 0 is rejected.  X 
Generally, for a multi-class informative gene discovery ap-plication (more than two phenotypes), the Kruskal-Wallis 1 , 1) 1 e ) rank sum test, which is a generalization of the Wilcoxon rank sum test, can be used. Limited by space, we omit the details here.
Many previous methods select the top k genesasthein-formative ones, where k is a parameter specified by the user. As discussed before and will be illustrated using real data later, the value k is very different from one data set to the other. Thus, it is very hard for a user to guess the right value.

Instead of guessing a magic number, is it possible that the user specify the quality requirement on the informative gene selection? Here, we propose a significance level threshold approach.

In statistics, the significance level measures the probabil-ity of type I errors. Thus, a user can use the significance level to specify the quality requirement. By this idea, our informative gene selection method takes a significance level threshold  X  max . Only the genes whose p -values that are less than the threshold are selected.

The major steps of the informative gene selection are as follows. 1. Specify a significance level threshold  X  max (e.g. 0.01), 2. Compute the Wilcoxon-statistic for every gene; 3. Use the statistics to compute the corresponding p -4. Select the genes whose p -values are smaller than the
To verify the effect of our rank sum test method for in-formative gene discovery, we build classifiers using support vector machines (SVM). As indicated by the previous stud-ies, SVM is capable of classification on high dimensional data sets with a small number of samples.
We test the effectiveness of the rank sum test method for informative gene discovery using two real data sets as follows. The experiments are implemented using Matlab 6.5 and SVM-Light [13]. SVM-Light is a free SVM software down-loadable at http://svmlight.joachims.org/.

As reported in Table 1, the two data sets do not follow the Gaussian distribution.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the rank sum method, we compare the accuracy of the SVM classifiers with and with-out the informative gene discovery.

For the rank sum method, we try four different signifi-cance levels: 0 . 1, 0 . 05, 0 . 01 and 0 . 001, respectively. The informative gene selection returns 210, 109, 34 and 8 infor-mative genes on the colon data set, and 1837, 1425, 844 and 398 genes on the leukemia data set, respectively.
We also try the following 3 kinds of support vector ma-chines.
Before plugging the data into the SVM-Light tool, we nor-malize the original expression data sets so that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1.

To make the test more robust, we conduct the 4-fold cross-validation experiments [5]. In particular, we randomly di-vide the colon data set that includes 40 tumor samples and 22 normal samples into 4 folds: each fold contains 10 tumor samples and 5 or 6 normal samples. Similarly, we randomly divide the leukemia data set with 47 ALL samples and 25 AML samples into 4 folds: each fold contains 18 samples  X  11 or 12 ALL samples and 6 or 7 AML samples.

Then, we try our experiment four times, each time we use three folds as the training data set and one fold as the testing data. Finally, we compute the average accuracy for the 4 results as our evaluation result. We use the prediction accuracy as our evaluation metric. We let the SVM-Light toolkit accept all testing patterns. That is, no testing pat-terns are rejected without labels. The prediction results are shown in Table 6 and Table 7, respectively.

On the colon data set, the best accuracy achieved by using the informative genes is 98 . 3%, where only one prediction error happens in the 4-fold cross-validation experiment. On the leukemia data set, the accuracy of the informative gene based method is even 100%.

The effectiveness of the informative genes is significant: using the informative genes improves the accuracy dramati-cally. This is consistent with the results in previous studies.
Moreover, the accuracy is not sensitive to the significance levels. The accuracy will decrease slightly, when either too many or too few informative genes are selected. That is because, on the one hand, too many genes (with a large significance level value) may include some unrelated genes that bring noise to the classifiers; on the other hand, too few genes (with a small significance level value) may filter out some useful information for the classifiers.

To analyze whether the number of genes determined by significance level is proper, we use the Wilcoxon statistic as the ranking criterion, and select the top k genes as common feature ranking methods do. The number k is determined by Thatis, weselect 10, 20, 40, ..., 1280 genes for the colon data set, and 10, 20, 40, ..., 5120 genes for the leukemia data set, respectively. Then, we construct SVM classifiers to test the accuracy. The results are shown in Figure 3(a) (for colon data set) and Figure 3(b) (for leukemia data set).
From the figures, we can see that the optimal numbers of informative genes are quite different between colon data and leukemia data. On the colon data set, the classifier using the top 40 informative genes gives approximately the best accuracy, while on the leukemia data set, the classifier using the top k genes has a perfect 100% accuracy when k is in the range of 160 to 1280. This experiment clearly shows why it is hard for a user to choose the value for parameter k in informative gene selection: the value of k can be very different in various data sets. Thus, it is hard for a user to choose a good value manually.

In the same figures, we also plot the numbers of infor-mative genes selected by significance levels and the corre-sponding prediction accuracy using the informative genes. It is interesting to notice that the significance level of 0 . 01 leads to almost the best performance on both data sets. This strongly suggests that the significance level indicates the quality of the informative genes properly. By rank sum test, we do not have to guess the number of informative genes. Instead, we can use some proper significance level, such as 0 . 01, to specify the quality requirement of the infor-mative genes. We will come back to this point in Section 5.
We compare the rank sum test method with some typical existing feature ranking methods. We choose two popular methods in the comparison, the method developed by Golub et al. [9] (called Golub X  X  method) and the t -statistic method developed by Alon et al. [1]. Their ranking criteria are dis-cussed in Section 2. For comparison, we select the same number of informative genes as the rank sum test method does at different significance levels for Golub X  X  method and the t -statistic method, and then construct the SVM clas-sifiers using the selected informative genes. The compari-son results of the prediction accuracy (average among the 3 SVM variants) on colon and leukemia data sets are shown in Table 8 and Table 9, respectively.

The results clearly show that the rank sum method is con-sistently better than the Golub X  X  method and the t -statistic method, while the latter two methods are comparable in accuracy. The improvement in accuracy of the rank sum method against the other two methods is about 2%  X  5%. This improvement is non-trivial, considering the baseline methods also achieve accuracy above 90%.

Moreover, we use the significance level to guide the selec-tion of number of informative genes. That is, the Golub X  X  method and the t -statistic method are also benefited from the proper numbers of informative genes in these experi-ments.

The experimental results are consistent with the Pitman efficiency theory. According to our normality test, both the colon data set and the leukemia data set have many genes violating the normality condition. So the statistics theory guarantees that the rank sum test method will outperform the t -statistic like methods in these two data sets. The experimental results concur with the statistics theory very well. In general, the rank sum test method is better than the t -statistic like methods for informative gene discovery.
As shown by the experiments, the rank sum method has a clear advantage. In this section, we present a further discus-sion on the rationale of informative gene discovery by rank sum test.

To quantify the quality of informative genes, it is impor-tant to measure the capability of a gene to discriminate phenotypes. Such a measure should be independent to the distribution of the gene expression levels. That is, such a measure should be assumption free for data distribution. Therefore, the Wilcoxon statistic (generally, the rank-sum statistics) and the p -value in rank sum test are ideal candi-dates for the quality measurement of informative genes.
The ranking criterion is critical for feature ranking meth-ods. A good ranking criterion should provide the following two guarantees. First, it should be able to quantify the sig-nificance of the difference between phenotypes. That is, a user can specify the quality requirement of the informative genes by specifying a threshold parameter using the ranking criterion. Second, a ranking criterion should give an order of the genes in quality. It should guarantee that gene g 1 better than g 2 if g 1 is before g 2 in the order.
Most of the ranking criteria in the previous studies can-not fully provide the above two guarantees. t -statistic can provide the guarantees if the data follows the normal distri-bution, which may not be true in microarray data.
Rank sum test is independent of data distribution. Thus, the significance level reflects the quality of the informative genes. This is guaranteed by the statistic properties.
Discovery of informative genes is crucial and indispensable for gene expression data analysis. It has extensive applica-tions in bioinformatics. Most of the previous methods take a feature ranking criterion and select the top k genes with the highest ranking values as the informative genes, where k is a user specified parameter. Usually, it is hard for the users to guess the values. The t -statistic method and its variants are the state-of-the-art feature ranking methods. However, this kind of methods inherently assume that the data fol-lows the Gaussian distribution, which is often violated in real microarray data sets according to our investigation.
In this paper, to overcome the defections mentioned above, we present a non-parametric rank sum test method for in-formative gene discovery. In statistics theory, the Pitman efficiency indicates it is more reasonable and reliable to use a rank sum test method rather than a t -statistic like method. By experiments on real data sets, we also show that the rank sum test approach is more accurate and robust.

Moreover, we propose the method to select informative genes using a significance level threshold. We show that the significance level threshold carries the quality requirement in statistics, is easy to specify, and performs consistent well on real data sets.

As future work, it is interesting to measure the quality of the informative genes more accurately. Moreover, we would like to explore more extensive applications of non-parametric testing methods in other bioinformatics prob-lems, such as analyzing time-series gene expression data, three-dimensional gene expression data sets [12] and the in-teraction between genes.
