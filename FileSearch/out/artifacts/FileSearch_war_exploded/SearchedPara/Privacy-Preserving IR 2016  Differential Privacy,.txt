 Due to lack of mature techniques in privacy-preserving in-formation retrieval (IR), concerns about information pri-vacy and security have become serious obstacles that pre-vent valuable user data to be used in IR research such as studies on query logs, social media, and medical record re-trieval. In SIGIR 2014 and SIGIR 2015, we have run the privacy-preserving IR workshops exploring and understand-ing the privacy and security risks in information retrieval. This year, we continue the efforts of connecting the two dis-ciplines of IR and privacy/ security by organizing this work-shop. We target on three themes, differential privacy and IR dataset release, privacy in search and browsing, and pri-vacy in social media. The workshop include panels with researchers from both fields on these three themes, as well as invite industry speakers for real-world challenges. The goals of this workshop include (1) bringing together the two research fields, and (2) yielding fruitful collaborations. Privacy-Preserving Information Retrieval
Information retrieval and information privacy/security are two fast-growing computer science disciplines. Information retrieval provides a set of information seeking, organization, analysis, and decision-making techniques. Information pri-vacy/security defends information from unauthorized or ma-licious use, disclosure, modification, attack, and destruction. The two disciplines often appear as two areas with opposite goals: one is to seek information from large amounts of ma-terials, the other is to protect (sensitive) information from being found out. On the other hand, there are many syn-ergies and connections between these two disciplines. For example, information retrieval researchers or practitioners often need to consider privacy or security issues in design-ing solutions for information processing and management, while researchers in information privacy and security often utilize information retrieval techniques when they build the adversary models to simulate how the adversary can actively seek sensitive information. However, there have been only limited efforts to connect the two important disciplines.
Due to lack of mature techniques in privacy-preserving in-formation retrieval, concerns about information privacy and security have become serious obstacles that prevent valuable user data to be used in IR research such as studies about query logs, social media, tweets, session analysis, and medi-cal record retrieval. For instance, the recent TREC Medical Record Retrieval Tracks are halted because of the privacy issue and the TREC Microblog Tracks could not provide participants with a standard testbed of tweets for system de-velopment. The situation needs to be improved in a timely manner.

In addition, with the emergence of online social networks and the growing popularity of digital communication, more and more information about individuals is becoming avail-able on the Internet. While much of this information is not sensitive, it is not uncommon for users to publish sensi-tive information online, especially on social networking sites. The availability of this publicly accessible and potentially sensitive data can lead to abuse and expose users to stalk-ing and identity theft. User privacy is at risk whenever owners of publicly available network resources can be traced and recorded, and their user activities can be mined and in-ferred. The digital ecosystem involves not only such threats to personal privacy but also promising cures. For example, information-theoretic protocols may decompose each user X  X  query into several sub-queries, ensuring they include no in-formation about the user X  X  intent.
 All these motivate us to propose this  X  X rivacy-preserving IR X  workshop in SIGIR. Since 2014, the privacy workshop has been running in SI-GIR. The first privacy-preserving IR workshop (PIR 2014) [5] received active participation. There were three keynotes given in the workshop. Most workshop attendees agreed that we need to continue to collaborate on this topic, and to seek both general and specific solutions to the privacy and secu-rity issues in various IR tasks. The second workshop (PIR 2015) [7] started to receive solutions to the problems that we identified in the previous year. It featured a keynote on differential privacy and a heated debate on  X  X rivacy would be resolved if the search is not personalized X . Both years X  workshop reports can be found in SIGIR forum too.
This year, the workshop organizers formed a team span-ning across IR, Privacy, and the government sector. We focus on forming IR and privacy research bridges and part-nerships and thus organizing panels by themes. For each theme, we invite researchers from IR and researchers from Privacy/Security to form pairs. The panel discussion not only focus on presenting problems but more on seeking so-lutions and achieving a mutual understanding of the research problem. Among many challenges in privacy-preserving IR, this year we focus on three major themes: differential pri-vacy for IR data release , privacy-preserving search/browsing and privacy and social media .
The three main themes of this year including the following.
This full day workshop includes invited speakers, panels, short contributed talks and a poster session. It ends with a breakout session. The activities are scheduled as the follow-ing: 09:00-09:30 Welcome and Introduction. 09:30-10:30 Invited speaker #1 (Differential privacy) 10:30-11:00 Coffee 11:00-11:45 Contributed talks (session #1) https://www.tunnelbear.com/ 11:45-12:30 Posters flowing into Lunch 12:30-13:30 Lunch 13:30-14:30 Invited speaker #2 (Industry) 14:30-15:15 Contributed talks (session #2) 15:15-16:30 Panel and breakout planning 16:30-17:30 Breakouts (research challenges) 17:30-18:00 Summary of breakouts
