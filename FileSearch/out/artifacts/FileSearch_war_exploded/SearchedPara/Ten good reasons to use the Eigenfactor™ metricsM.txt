 1. Introduction
The Eigenfactor metric is a measure of journal influence ( Bergstrom, 2007; Bergstrom, West, &amp; Wiseman, 2008; West, Alt-house, Bergstrom, Rosvall, &amp; Bergstrom, 2007 ). Unlike traditional metrics, like the popular Impact Factor, the Eigenfactor other influential journals. The definition is clearly recursive in terms of influence and the computation of the Eigenfactor scores involves the search of a stationary distribution, which corresponds to the leading eigenvector of a perturbed citation matrix.
 The Eigenfactor method was initially developed by Jevin West, Ben Althouse, Martin Rosvall, and Carl Bergstrom at the
University of Washington and Ted Bergstrom at the University of California Santa Barbara. Eigenfactor scores are freely accessible at the Eigenfactor web site ( West et al., 2007 ) and, since 2007, they have been incorporated into Thomson Reuters Journal Citation Reports (JCR) for both Science and Social Science journals.

The idea underlying the Eigenfactor method originates from the work of Pinski and Narin (1976) in the field of bibliomet-rics and from the contribution of Hubbell (1965) in the context of sociometry, which, in turn, generalizes Leontief X  X  input X  output model for the economic system ( Leontief, 1941 ). Notably, Brin and Page use a similar intuition to design the popular
PageRank algorithm that is part of their Google search engine: the importance of a web page is determined by the number of hyperlinks it receives from other pages as well as by the importance of the linking pages ( Brin &amp; Page, 1998; Brin, Page, Motwani, &amp; Winograd, 1999 ).

In this short contribution, we suggest and motivate 10 reasons to use the Eigenfactor journal ranking method. 2. The Eigenfactor metrics cles published in journal j during a target window consisting of the five previous years. Hence, the i th row represents the divided by the total number of articles published by all journals over the same period. Notice that a is positive and sum to 1.
A dangling node in the citation network corresponds to a journal i that does not cite any other journals; hence, if i is a dangling node, then i has no outgoing edges and the i th row of the citation matrix has all 0 entries. The citation matrix C is transformed into a normalized matrix H  X  X  h i ; j  X  such that all rows that are not dangling nodes are normalized by the row sum, that is, replaced with the article vector a . Notice that b H is row-stochastic, that is all rows are non-negative and sum to 1. A new row-stochastic matrix P is defined as follows: j is:
In words, the Eigenfactor score of a journal is the sum of normalized citations received from other journals weighted by the influence of the citing journals. The Eigenfactor scores are normalized such that they sum to 100.

The Eigenfactor score is a size-dependent measure: with all else equal, bigger journals will have larger Eigenfactor scores, since they have more articles and hence we expect them to be cited more often. The Article Influence measure is the size-the journal Eigenfactor score divided by the number of articles published by the journal over the 5-year target period; hence, it corresponds to the journal Eigenfactor score per published article.

Finally, we recall the definition of the Impact Factor, which is, undoubtedly, the most popular and controversial biblio-metric indicator available at the moment. It is defined, for a given journal, as the mean number of citations in a given census year to papers published in the journal during a target window consisting of the two previous years ( Garfield, 2006 ). 3. Ten good reasons to use the Eigenfactor metrics
In our opinion, there are enough good reasons to use the Eigenfactor method to evaluate journal influence: 1. It weights citations with the importance of the citing journals . Citations from highly-ranked journals, like Nature, Sci-3. It uses a target window of 5 years . This period is larger than the 2-year target window exploited in the commonly used 4. It exploits the entire citation network . The algorithm underlying the Eigenfactor metric uses the structure of the entire 5. It ignores journal self-citations . This avoids over inflating journals that engage in the practice of opportunistic self-7. It has a sound axiomatic foundation. Palacios-Huerta and Volij (2004) follow an axiomatic approach to show a unique-8. It is strongly related to other ranking metrics . Journal PageRank is a journal ranking technique proposed by Bollen et al. 9. It is a flexible method that can be applied to a variety of contexts . In principle, the algorithmic schema underlying the 4. Conclusion
Despite the statistically significant correlation between the journal rankings provided by the Impact Factor and the Eigen-factor metrics  X  Franceschet (in press) measured a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.77 with respect to the Eigenfactor to the three metrics contain more than a few marked discrepancies ( Bollen et al., 2006; Franceschet, 2010; West, Bergstrom, ings of the National Academy of Sciences of USA, and Science. The Article Influence ranking is leaded by Reviews of Modern Physics, Annual Review of Immunology, and Annual Review of Biochemistry. The Eigenfactor leader, Nature, ranks 9th. The top-3 journals according to Impact Factor are CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, The New England Journal of Medicine, and Annual Review of Immunology. Nature, the Eigenfactor head, ranks 8th, while the Article Influence skipper, Reviews of Mod-ence listing, and even 521st in the Eigenfactor compilation.
