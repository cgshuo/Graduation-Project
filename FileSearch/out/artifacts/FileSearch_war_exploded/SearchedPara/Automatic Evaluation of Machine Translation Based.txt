 In machine translation (MT) research, appropriately evaluating the quality of MT results is an important issue. In recent years, many researchers have tried to automatically evaluate the quality of MT and im-prove the performance of automatic MT evaluations (Niessen et al., 2000; Akiba et al., 2001; Papineni et al., 2002; NIST, 2002; Leusch et al., 2003; Turian et al., 2003; Babych and Hartley, 2004; Lin and Och, 2004; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Gime  X  nez et al., 2005) because improving the performance of auto-matic MT evaluation is expected to enable us to use and improve MT systems efficiently. For example, Och reported that the quality of MT results was im-proved by using automatic MT evaluation measures for the parameter tuning of an MT system (Och, 2003). This report shows that the quality of MT re-sults improves as the performance of automatic MT evaluation improves.

MT systems can be ranked if a set of MT re-sults for each system and their reference translations are given. Usually, about 300 or more sentences are used to automatically rank MT systems (Koehn, 2004). However, the quality of a sentence translated by an MT system is difficult to evaluate. For exam-ple, the results of five MTs into Japanese of the sen-tence  X  X he percentage of stomach cancer among the workers appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers. X  are shown in Table 1. A conventional au-tomatic evaluation method ranks the fifth MT result first although its human subjective evaluation is the lowest. This is because conventional methods are based on the similarity between a translated sentence and its reference translation, and they give the trans-lated sentence a high score when the two sentences are globally similar to each other in terms of lexical overlap. However, in the case of the above example, the most important thing to maintain a high trans-lation quality is to correctly translate  X  X or X  into the target language, and it would be difficult to detect the importance just by comparing an MT result and its reference translations even if the number of ref-erence translations is increased.

In general, when translating a given sentence, one or more conditions should be satisfied to maintain a high translation quality. In this paper, we show that constructing a test set where the conditions that are mainly established from a linguistic point of view are assigned to each test-set sentence in the form of yes/no questions, developing a system that de-termines an answer to each question, and combin-ing a measure based on the questions and conven-tional measures enable the evaluation of the quality of a translated sentence more appropriately than us-ing conventional methods. We also present a method for automatically generating sub-goals in the form of yes/no questions and estimating the rate of accom-plishment of the sub-goals. 2.1 Test Set Two main types of data are used for evaluating MT quality. One type of data is constructed by arbi-trarily collecting sentence pairs in the source-and target-languages, and the other is constructed by in-tensively collecting sentence pairs that include lin-guistic phenomena that are difficult to automatically translate. Recently, MT evaluation campaigns such as the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation 1 , NIST Machine Translation Evaluation , and HTRDP Evaluation 3 were organized to sup-port the improvement of MT techniques. The data used in the evaluation campaigns were arbitrarily collected from newspaper articles or travel conver-sation data for fair evaluation. They are classified as the former type of data mentioned above. On the other hand, the data provided by NTT (Ikehara et al., 1994) and that constructed by JEIDA (Isahara, 1995) are classified as the latter type. Almost all the data mentioned above consist of only parallel translations in two languages. Data with information for evaluat-ing MT results, such as JEIDA X  X  are rarely found. In this paper, we call data that consist of parallel trans-lations collected for MT evaluation and that the in-formation for MT evaluation is assigned to, a test set .

The most characteristic information assigned to the JEIDA test set is the yes/no question for assess-ing the translation results. For example, a yes/no question such as  X  X s  X  X or X  translated into an expres-sion representing a cause/reason such as  X  X e X ? X  (in Japanese) is assigned to a test-set sentence. We can evaluate MT results objectively by answering the question. An example of a test-set sample consist-ing of an ID, a source-language sample sentence, its reference translation, and a question is as follows. ID 1.1.7.1.3-1
Sample sen-tence
Reference translation (in Japanese)
Question Is  X  X ppear to X  translated into an
The questions are classified mainly in terms of grammar, and the numbers to the left of the hyphen-ation of each ID such as 1.1.7.1.3 represent the cat-egories of the questions. For example, the above question is related to catenative verbs.

The JEIDA test set consists of two parts, one for the evaluation of English-Japanese MT and the other for that of Japanese-English MT. We focused on the part for English-Japanese MT. This part consists of 769 sample sentences, each of which has a yes/no question.

The 769 sentences were translated by using five commercial MT systems to investigate the relation-ship between subjective evaluation based on yes/no questions and conventional subjective evaluation based on fluency and adequacy. The instruction for the subjective evaluation based on fluency and ad-equacy followed that given in the TIDES specifi-cation (TIDES, 2002). The subjective evaluation based on yes/no questions was done by manually answering each question for each translation. The subjective evaluation based on the yes/no questions was stable; namely, it was almost independent of the human subjects in our preliminary investigation. There were only two questions for which the an-swers generated inconsistency in the subjective eval-uation when 1,500 question-answer pairs were ran-domly sampled and evaluated by two human sub-jects.

Then, we investigated the correlation between the two types of subjective evaluation. The correlation coefficients mentioned in this paper are statistically significant at the 1% or less significance level. The Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient is used in this paper. In the subjective evaluation based on yes/no questions, yes and no were numerically trans-formed into 1 and  X  1 . For 3,845 translations ob-tained by using five MT systems, the correlation co-efficients between the subjective evaluations based on yes/no questions and based on fluency and ade-quacy were 0.48 for fluency and 0.63 for adequacy. These results indicate that the two subjective evalu-ations have relatively strong correlations. The cor-relation is especially strong between the subjective evaluation based on yes/no questions and adequacy. 2.2 Expansion of JEIDA Test Set Each sample sentence in the JEIDA test set has only one question. Therefore, in the subjective evalua-tion using the JEIDA test set, translation errors that do not involve the pre-assigned question are ignored even if they are serious. Therefore, translations that have serious errors that are not related to the ques-tion tend to be evaluated as being of high quality. To solve this problem, we expanded the test set by adding new questions about translations with the se-rious errors.

Sentences whose average grades were three or less for fluency and adequacy for the translation re-sults of the five MT systems were selected for the expansion. Besides them, sentences whose average grades were more than three for fluency and ade-quacy for the translation results of the five MT sys-tems were selected when a majority of evaluation results based on yes/no questions about the transla-tions of the five MT systems were no. The number of selected sentences was 150. The expansion was manually performed using the following steps. 1. Serious translation errors are extracted from the 2. For each extracted error, questions strongly re-3. Each MT result is evaluated according to each Eventually, one or more questions were assigned to each selected sentence in the test set. Among the 150 selected sentences, questions were newly assigned to 103 sentences. The number of added questions was 148. The maximum number of questions added to a sentence was five. After expanding the test set, the correlation coefficients between the subjective evaluations based on yes/no questions and based on fluency and adequacy increased from 0.48 to 0.51 for fluency and from 0.63 to 0.66 for adequacy. The differences between the correlation coefficients ob-tained before and after the expansion are statistically significant at the 5% or less significance level for adequacy. These results indicate that the expansion of the test set significantly improves the correlation between the subjective evaluations based on yes/no questions and based on adequacy. When two or more questions were assigned to a test-set sentence, the subjective evaluation based on the questions was decided by the majority answer. The majority an-swers, yes and no, were numerically transformed into 1 and  X  1 . Ties between yes and no were trans-formed into 0. Examples of added questions and the subjective evaluations based on the questions are shown in Tables 2 and 3. 3.1 A New Measure for Evaluating Machine The JEIDA test set was not designed for auto-matic evaluation but for human subjective evalua-tion. However, a measure for automatic MT evalu-ation that strongly correlates fluency and adequacy is likely to be established because the subjective evaluation based on yes/no questions has a rela-tively strong correlation with the subjective evalua-tion based on fluency and adequacy, as mentioned in Section 2. In this section, we describe a method for automatically evaluating MT quality by predicting an answer to each yes/no question and using those answers.

Hereafter, we assume that each yes/no question is defined as a sub-goal that a given translation should satisfy and that the sub-goal is accomplished if the answer to the corresponding yes/no question to the sub-goal is yes. We also assume that the sub-goal is unaccomplished if the answer is no. A new eval-uation score, A , is defined based on a multiple lin-ear regression model as follows using the rate of ac-complishment of the sub-goals and the similarities between a given translation and its reference trans-lation. The best-fitted line for the observed data is calculated by the method of least-squares (Draper and Smith, 1981).

A =
Q
Q Here, the term Q j corresponds to the rate of accom-plishment of the sub-goal having the i -th ID, and  X 
Q j is a weight for the rate of accomplishment. The term Q j corresponds to the rate of unaccomplish-ment of the sub-goal having the i -th ID, and  X  Q weight for the rate of unaccomplishment. The value n indicates the number of types of sub-goals. The term  X  is constant.

The term S i indicates a similarity between a trans-lated sentence and its reference translation, and  X  S i is a weight for the similarity. Many methods for cal-culating the similarity have been proposed (Niessen et al., 2000; Akiba et al., 2001; Papineni et al., 2002; NIST, 2002; Leusch et al., 2003; Turian et al., 2003; Babych and Hartley, 2004; Lin and Och, 2004; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Gime  X  nez et al., 2005). In our research, 23 scores, namely BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) with maximum n-gram lengths of 1, 2, 3, and 4, NIST (NIST, 2002) with maximum n-gram lengths of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, GTM (Turian et al., 2003) with exponents of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, METEOR (ex-act) (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), WER (Niessen et al., 2000), PER (Leusch et al., 2003), and ROUGE (Lin, 2004) with n-gram lengths of 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 4 variants (LCS, S  X  ,SU  X  , W-1.2), were used to cal-culate each similarity S i . Therefore, the value of m in Eq. (1) was 23. Japanese word segmentation was performed by using JUMAN 4 in our experiments.
As you can see, the definition of our new measure is based on a combination of an evaluation measure focusing on local information and that focusing on global information. 3.2 Automatic Estimation of Rate of The rate of accomplishment of sub-goals is esti-mated by determining the answer to each question as yes or no. This section describes a method based on simple patterns for determining the answers.
An answer to each question is automatically de-termined by checking whether patterns are included in a translation or not. The patterns are constructed for each question. All of the patterns are expressed in hiragana characters. Before applying the pat-terns to a given translation, the translation is trans-formed into hiragana characters, and all punctuation is eliminated. The transformation to hiragana char-acters was performed by using JUMAN in our ex-periments.

Test-set sentences, the questions assigned to them, and the patterns constructed for the questions are shown in Table 4. In the patterns, the symbol  X  |  X  represents  X  X R X . 3.3 Automatic Sub-goal Generation and We found that expressions important for maintain-ing a high translation quality were often commonly included in the reference translations for each test-set sentence. We also found that the expression was also related to the yes/no question assigned to the test-set sentence. Therefore, we automatically gen-erate yes/no questions in the following steps. 1. For each test-set sentence, a set of words com-2. For each combination of n words in the set 3. For each test-set sentence, the sub-goal is de-If no common skip word n-grams are found, the yes/no question is not generated. The answer to the yes/no question is determined to be yes if all of the common skip word n-grams are included in a trans-lation. Otherwise, the answer is determined to be no.

This scheme assigns greater weight to important phrases that should be included in the translation to maintain a high translation quality. Our observation is that those important phrases are often common between human translations. A similar scheme was proposed by Babych and Hartley (Babych and Hart-ley, 2004) for BLEU. In their scheme, greater weight is assigned to components that are salient through-out the document. Therefore, their scheme focuses on global context while our scheme focuses on local context. We believe that the two schemes are com-plementary to each other. In our experiments, the translation results of three MT systems and their subjective evaluation results were used as a development set for constructing the patterns described in Section 3.2 and for tuning the parameters  X  S i ,  X  Q j ,  X  Q translations and evaluation results of the remaining two MT systems were used as an evaluation set for testing.

In the development set, each test-set sentence has at least one question, at least one reference transla-tion, three MT results, and subjective evaluation re-sults of the three MT results. The patterns for deter-mining yes/no answers were manually constructed for the questions assigned to the 769 test-set sen-tences. There were 917 questions assigned to them. Among them, the patterns could be constructed for 898 questions assigned to 767 test-set sentences. The remaining 19 questions were skipped because making simple patterns as described in Section 3.2 was difficult; for example, one of the questions was  X  X s the whole sentence translated into one sen-tence? X . The yes/no answer determination accura-cies obtained by using the patterns are shown in Ta-ble 5.
 Table 5: Results of yes/no answer determination.
We investigated the correlation between the eval-uation score, A in Eq. (1) and the subjective eval-uations, fluency and adequacy, for the 769 test-set sentences. First, to maximize the correlation coeffi-cients between the evaluation score, A , and the hu-man subjective evaluations, fluency and adequacy, the optimal values of  X  S i ,  X  Q j ,  X  Q Eq. (1) were investigated using the development set within a framework of multiple linear regression modeling (Draper and Smith, 1981). Then, the cor-relation coefficients were investigated by using the optimal value set. The results are shown in Table 6, 7, and 8. In these tables,  X  X onventional method X  in-dicates the correlation coefficients obtained when A was calculated by using only similarities S i .  X  X on-ventional method (combination) X  is a combination of existing automatic evaluation methods from the literature.  X  X ur method (automatic) X  indicates the correlation coefficients obtained when the results of the automatic determination of yes/no answers were used to calculate Q j and Q j in Eq. (1). For the 19 questions for which the patterns could not be con-structed, Q j was set at 0.  X  X ur method (full au-tomatic) X  indicates the correlation coefficients ob-tained when the results of the automatic sub-goal generation and determination of rate of accomplish-Table 6: Coefficients of correlation between evaluation score tion is used to calculate S i .)

Table 8: Coefficients of correlation between evaluation score translations are used to calculate S i .) ment of sub-goals were used to calculate Q j and Q j in Eq. (1). Skip word trigrams, skip word bigrams, and skip word unigrams were used for generating the sub-goals according to our preliminary experi-ments.  X  X ur method (upper bound) X  indicates the correlation coefficients obtained when human judg-ments on the questions were used to calculate Q j and Q j .

As shown in Table 6, 7, and 8, our methods signif-icantly outperform the conventional methods from literature. Note that WER outperformed other indi-vidual measures like BLEU and NIST in our exper-iments, and the combination of existing automatic evaluation methods from the literature outperformed individual lexical similarity measures by themselves in almost all cases. The differences between the correlation coefficients obtained using our method and the conventional methods are statistically sig-nificant at the 5% or less significance level for flu-ency and adequacy, even if the number of reference translations increases, except in three cases shown in Table 7 and 8. This indicates that considering the rate of accomplishment of sub-goals to automat-ically evaluate the quality of each translation is use-ful, especially when the number of reference trans-lations is small.

The differences between the correlation coeffi-cients obtained using two automatic methods are not significant. These results indicate that we can reduce the development cost for constructing sub-goals. However, there are still significant gaps between the correlation coefficients obtained using a fully auto-matic method and upper bounds. These gaps indi-cate that we need further improvement in automatic sub-goal generation and automatic estimation of rate of accomplishment of sub-goals, which is our future work.

Human judgments of adequacy and fluency are known to be noisy, with varying levels of intercoder agreement. Recent work has tended to apply cross-judge normalization to address this issue (Blatz et al., 2003). We would like to evaluate against the normalized data in the future. We demonstrated that the quality of a translated sen-tence can be evaluated more appropriately than by using conventional methods. That was demonstrated by constructing a test set where the conditions that should be satisfied to maintain a high translation quality are assigned to each test-set sentence in the form of a question, by developing a system that de-termines an answer to each question, and by com-bining a measure based on the questions and con-ventional measures. We also presented a method for automatically generating sub-goals in the form of yes/no questions and estimating the rate of accom-plishment of the sub-goals. Promising results were obtained.

In the near future, we would like to expand the test set to improve the upper bound obtained by our method. We are also planning to expand the method and improve the accuracy of the automatic sub-goal generation and determination of the rate of accomplishment of sub-goals. The sub-goals of a given sentence should be generated by considering the complexity of the sentence and the alignment in-formation between the original source-language sen-tence and its translation. Further advanced genera-tion and estimation would give us information about the erroneous parts of MT results and their quality. We believe that future research would allow us to develop high-quality MT systems by tuning the sys-tem parameters based on the automatic MT evalua-tion measures.
