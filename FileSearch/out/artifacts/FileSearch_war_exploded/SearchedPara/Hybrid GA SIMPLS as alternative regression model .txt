 1. Introduction
Cracks that reflect the structural ageing and disease are prevalent in various types of dams (e.g., Meishan dam ( Gu et al., 2000 ), Chencun dam ( Shen et al., 1994 ), and Pacoima dam Yusof, 2004 ). Dam cracks are generally caused by three major factors: tempera-ture variation, chemical reactions, and live loads ( Koroneos et al., 2004 ). Many attempts have been made to understand and predict dam cracking, by usually using either of the two following methods: statistical (regression) analys is and mechanical calculation. Tonini (1956) first proposed the idea that dam displacement can be broken down into the following three causative effects (loads): water pressure, temperature variation, and ageing. Consequently, research-ers further studied these effects a nd proposed deterministic models, purely statistical (regression) models, and hybrid models, which is a combination of the first two models ( Xerez and Lamas, 1958 ; Silveria and Jose, 1964 ; Bonaldi et al., 1977 ; Wu, 1990 ).
Least-squares regression approaches (e.g. stepwise regression), which are simple and require no prior knowledge of the structure material properties, have been gain ing popularity for dam deforma-tion analysis for a long time now. Unfortunately, dam engineers are not completely satisfied with t he performance of the existing regression models in cases where multicollinearity and influential outliers exist among variables ( Wu, 1990 ). Furthermore, the defor-mation contributed by external loa ds (e.g., water pressure, tempera-ture variation, and ageing) are sometimes difficult to single out when these factors are strongly correlated ( Chrzanowski et al., 1991 ). Hence, other regression techniques such as principal compo-nent regression (PCR) ( Li et al., 2008 ) and partial least squares (PLS) regression ( Deng et al., 2008 ), are proposed to circumvent multi-collinearity. PCR is a technique involving the use of principal components (PCs) with the highest v ariance to estimate the regres-sion coefficients. However, in some cases, low-variance PCs may also be important ( Jolliffe Ian, 1982 ). In addition, the coefficients obtained by PLS regression with the c ross-validation (CV) criterion are not sufficient for indicating t he explanatory capacity between independent and dependent variables ( Liu et al., 2006 ). More recent studies ( Xu and Deng, 2011 ; Hu et al., 2009 ) have revealed that the truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) and Tikhonov regularisation (or ridge regression) can solve the multicollinearity problem of dam regression models. Unfortunately, the problem of regularisation parameter-choice has not been well solved yet ( Hansen, 1994 ; Martin, 1996 ). As aforementioned, the multicolli-nearity poses a constant challenge for engineers involved in dam deformation analysis; dam engineers are looking for the ideal statistical model that has the least number of coefficients with the highest significance possible. To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few references available in the literatures that help in the correct selection of variables, thus hindering the search for the ideal statistical model. If all independent variables are included in the regression analysis, the regressor may be ill-posed. If the variables are incorrectly selected or are uni nformative, it will be difficult to interpret the regression coefficients. A possible solution to the abovementioned problems would be to remove the redundant variables that do not significantly affect the response variable.
However, the problem is how to eliminate the redundant variables and how to select the most informative variables. Many studies ( Swierenga et al., 1998 ; Leardi and Gonza  X  lez, 1998 ; Li and Susan, 2007 ) have shown that the removal of some uninformative variables improves the predictive ability of PLS models. Recently, genetic algorithms (GAs) have proven to be an efficient variable selection technique for PLS in chemometrics; one such selection technique is often called GA-PLS. However, little research has been conducted in dam deformation analysis. Chen et al. (2008) proposed the use of an improved GA to optimise and re-ev aluate the partial regression coefficients. Yang et al. (2010) suggested that GA-based PLS regres-sion could be a promising method for solving the poor-fitting and multicollinearity problems. However, the results in ( Chen et al., 2008 ; Yang et al., 2010 ) may have been more beneficial if the adverse effects of outliers were considered, because PLS regression is sensitive to outliers owing to the use of the covariance matrix between the independent variables and the dependent variables ( Hubert and Vanden Branden, 2003 ). Furthermore, the normal GA with outliers will lead to a poor selection of variables ( Enric et al., 2011 ). Thus further studies are required for discussing the applic-ability and reliability of GA and PLS regression in dam deformation analysis.

SIMPLS regression with the predictor variables selected by GA-PLS (hybrid GA/SIMPLS regression) and to compare it with other statistical approaches used for dam deformation analysis. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the statistical relation between the loads and the dam behaviour, then gives a brief review of PLS regression and GA-PLS. Section 3 provides a case study of an earth-rock dam, which includes multicollinearity diagnosis, outlier detection, variable selection, displacement (crack opening) fitting and forecasting. Several figures are provided to illustrate the comparison among the hybrid GA/SIMPLS, ordinary SIMPLS, and stepwise regression, respectively. Finally, Section 4 presents concluding remarks. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Statistical relation between the loads and the dam behaviour geo-mechanical factors. We should therefore study the variables that influence the dam behaviour before applying regression approaches. According to the research results in ( Wu, 1990 ;
Chen and Chrzanowski, 1986 ), the basic formulation for an observed deformation y of a monitoring point located on the dam can be modelled as follows: y  X  y H  X  y T  X  y y  X  E  X  1  X  where y H , y T , and y y are the displacements contributed by hydrostatic pressure, temperature variation, and ageing, respec-tively. E is the error component.
 described by a polynomial function for the reservoir water level H above the foundation as follows: y H  X  a 0  X  a 1 H  X  a 2 H 2  X  X  a n H n  X  2  X  can be modelled in two ways. If some key temperatures T j dam are measured, then y  X  b 1 T 1  X  b 2 T 2  X  X  b j T j  X  3  X 
If temperature measurements are incomplete or not available, trigonometric functions as temperature cyclic (seasonal) loadings can be used to describe deformation patterns as follows: y  X  b 1 sin  X  2 p t = 365  X  X  b 2 cos  X  2 p t = 365  X  where t is the time in days from the observation date to the initial reference date.

The displacement contributed by ageing can be modelled as follows: y  X  c 1  X  t = 100  X  X  c 2 ln  X  t = 100  X  X  5  X 
In the above expressions, a i , b i , and c i are the unknown regression coefficients to be estimated. 2.2. Multicollinearity problem of dam regression model
Let A be a centred matrix with causative quantities (e.g., water level, temperature variation, and ageing), and let x be the regres-sion coefficient vector to be estimated. We then rewrite (1) as y  X  Ax  X  6  X 
Assuming A has no exact zero singular values, we can obtain the least squares solution: ^ x  X  X  A T A  X  1 A T y  X  7  X  where superscript T is the transpose of a vector or matrix.
By inspection, we note that the polynomials representing the water level (i.e. H 1  X  H n ) are highly correlated with each other, and this correlation may be more obvious when the reservoir water level is high, especially for large concrete arch dams. In addition, sections of the upstream wall are facing the sun during most of the daytime, thus the relationship among air temperature, con-crete temperature, and water balance is mostly uncertain. In this case, the matrix inverse A T A may be close to singular, and a small change resulting from the field monitoring process can generate biased coefficients and ultimately unstable predictions. 2.3. Partial least squares (PLS) regression
PLS was originally developed by Wold (1966) as an econo-metric technique and then introduced in chemometrics ( Wold et al., 2001 ). PLS regression is a statistical approach that involves the use of the PC analysis to determine a regression model with latent variables and response variables. This method is especially useful when (1) the number of observations is equal or more than the number of predictor variables and (2) multicollinearity exists among the variables ( Luis et al., 2009 ). Two popular algorithms for PLS  X  nonlinear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS) and statistically inspired modification of PLS algorithm (SIMPLS)  X  are presented in the literature (see ( Wold, 1966 ; De Jong, 1993 )).
Wise (2011) has suggested that the SIMPLS algorithm is, in fact, slightly superior to NIPALS, because SIMPLS is actually derived to solve a specific objective function, i.e. to maximise the covariance criterion, unlike NIPALS. The SIMPLS procedure ( Wise, 2011 ) of (6) can be concluded as follows:
M  X  A T 0 Y 0 for i  X  1to k r i  X  u  X  : , 1  X  t p i  X  A T 0 t i =  X  t T i t i  X  end where s is the diagonal matrix with nonnegative diagonal elements in decreasing order, u and v are unitary matrices, k is the number of factors to be retained in the formation of the model, R is the matrix of weights, P is the matrix of loadings, and T is the matrix of scores. More mathematical details about SIMPLS can be found in ( De Jong, 1993 ). 2.4. Genetic algorithm with partial least squares (GA-PLS) GA-PLS is a novel method that combines the GA with PLS regression for the spectroscopic analysis of material composition; in this method, the GA is used for band selection and PLS links the selected bands to the compositional parameter (e.g., equivalent water thickness and dry matter content of fuel moisture content ( Li and Susan, 2007 )). The GA-PLS toolbox developed by Leardi and Gonza  X  lez (1998) was adopted in this work to select informa-tive variables for forecasting the dam crack opening. The steps of GA-PLS generally include the following ( Enric et al., 2011 ; Leardi, 2011 ):
Step 1: Set parameters (e.g., chromosomes, mutation prob-ability, and crossover probability) (1st generation).

Step 2: Do PLS and get standard error of CV for statistically valid number of factors.
 Step 3: Do backward elimination of variables.
 Step 4: Track variable selection frequency.

Step 5: Swap of the variables with the best root-mean-square error of CV (RMSECV) combinations.
 Step 6: Next, for 2nd generation, repeat PLS, etc.
 Step 7: Stop after 100 evaluations.

Step 8: Do 100 runs and use variables with the highest frequency of selection.

A more detailed description of GA-PLS can be referenced in ( Leardi and Gonza  X  lez, 1998 ; Leardi, 2011 ). 3. Case study 3.1. Data set
A series of observations including the water level and crack opening of an earth-rock dam in China were used for building the regression model. The crest length of the dam is 435 m, the crest elevation is approximately 59.3 m, and the total reservoir capacity is about three billion cubic metres. In this study, we examined the recorded data of the monitoring point No. 31, which is located at the centre of the impervious reinforced concrete face of the dam, as shown in Fig. 1 . The test dataset, built up over a period of two years, consists of 121 pairs. The first 99 pairs of the dataset were used to build the regression model, and the remaining data were used to test the predictive ability of the model. By considering the dam characteristics and the available observations, we selected the eleven variables listed in Table 1 as the influential factors for forecasting dam crack openings. 3.2. Multicollinearity diagnosis
Multicollinearity in multiple linear regressions can be detected by examining variance inflation factors (VIFs); the commonly used rule of thumb is that a VIF of 10 or higher indicates a multicollinearity problem ( O X  X rien, 2007 ). Big values of VIF (see
Fig. 2 ) and high correlations between some pairs of coefficients (see Table 2 ) are warning signs of multicollinearity. In this case, we performed both GA-PLS and stepwise method to select informative predictor variables. A discussion of the simulated results and analyses is presented in the following sections. 3.3. Outlier detection
Aberrant observations (outliers), caused by malfunction of the measurement equipment, human error, and unexpected occur-rence during investigation, can influence the performance of data-based prediction models. Hodge and Austin (2004) have proposed some fundamental approaches (e.g. regression diagnostics) to solve the problem of outliers. In this work, we performed diagnostic analyses using SIMPLS (part of LIBRA, a MATLAB library for robust analysis ( Verboven and Hubert, 2005 ) to identify the outliers. The results of these analyses yielded the following three types of outliers with cut-off values at a confidence level of 97.5%: orthogonal outliers (with small score distance (SD) and large orthogonal distance (OD)), bad leverage points (with large SD and large OD or large absolute residuals), and vertical outliers (with small SD and large absolute residual). For more details on the analyses, refer to ( Verboven and Hubert, 2005 ). Fig. 3 (a) shows a score diagnostic plot of the dataset using six PCs with the
RMSECV criterion (see Fig. 3 (b)). In the diagnostic plot, we found two orthogonal outliers (observations 48 and 73). Next, we constructed a regression diagnostic plot to identify the outliers (see Fig. 3 (c)). In this plot, we see four clear vertical outliers (observations 63, 82, 88, and 84), three good leverage points (observations 1, 49, and 50), no bad leverage points, and three borderline cases. Because bad leverage points, vertical outliers, and orthogonal outliers influence the ordinary least squares regression fit, these aberrant observations were removed before applying GA-PLS to select the informative variables. 3.4. Selection of informative variables ( Leardi, 2000 ). Therefore, we should test the safety of this approach before applying it to variable selection. First, we performed a randomisation test (50 runs with 100 evaluations of random permutations of the Y variable) to assess the potential over-fitting problem in the GA-based variable selection of the dataset. The parameters were set to default values (see Table 3 )so as to obtain the best exploitation ( Leardi, 2000 ).
 that the average percentage of variances obtained from the randomisation test is 1.3302, indicating that the GA can be applied safely without being concerned about over-fitting ( Leardi, 2011 ).
Then, 20 runs with 200 evaluations with  X  X  X eal X  X  Y variables were performed, followed by 20 runs each with a different random permutation to obtain a good model without over-fitting. As a rule of thumb, the best way to determine the optimal number of evaluations is to select a value from which no significant increase in the difference is observed; if the selected value is lower than 50, then select 50 ( Leardi, 2011 ). Thus, the optimal number of evaluations was set to 50 from the difference between the averages of real and randomised runs shown in Fig. 4 (b).
We then performed GA-PLS to select informative variables using the optimal number of evaluations (i.e. 50 evaluations). Ten iterations of GA-PLS were adopted to reduce the random errors.
Fig. 5 (a) shows the histogram of the frequency of selection of each variable in the ten GA models. Fig. 5 (b) shows the plot of RMSECV against the number of variables. By investigating these plots, we can see which variables are selected the most often and which ones are rarely or never selected. The horizontal line in
Fig. 5 (a) represents the cut-off values for selecting the informative variables with the lowest RMSECV (see Fig. 5 (b)), five variables (var. 1, var. 3, var. 4, var. 7, and var. 11) are detected as the most informative for the future analysis of dam crack opening. Mean-while, the stepwise method with default entry and removal criteria was also carried out for comparison with the GA-PLS model. The comparison results are listed in Table 4 . 3.5. Modelling and forecasting
In this work, we again adopted the RMSECV as a function to determine the optimal number of PC factors needed as the input for PLS modelling. From the RMSECV curve of the reduced dataset ( Fig. 6 ), we decided to retain four PCs to build a dam crack opening forecasting model using hybrid GA/SIMPLS. On the other hand, ordinary SIMPLS and stepwise regression were also carried out in this study for comparison with the GA/SIMPLS model. Both the correlation coefficient (R) and the root-mean-square error for prediction (RMSEP) ( Verboven and Hubert, 2005 ) were used to measure the performance of these three models. The detailed comparison is shown in Fig. 7 , and the results are listed in Table 5 .
The same procedure has been applied to the observables of other two monitoring points (No. 34 and No. 39) to verify the reliability of the proposed model over that of other models. Details of the investigation are listed in Tables 6 and 7 and shown in Fig. 7 .
To the best of our knowledge, hydrostatic pressure and thermal gradient generally reflect the elastic displacement under loads, and ageing (e.g., creep of concrete and foundation) reflects the non-elastic dam behaviour ( Wu, 1990 ; Chen and Chrzanowski, 1986 ; Luc and Vincnet, 2006 ). Tables 4 and 6 indicate that hydraulic factors (i.e. reservoir water level) are excluded in the stepwise regression model when severe multicollinearity exists among variables. The stepwise models adopted herein are there-fore unacceptable from a professional point of view and may lead to incorrect misinterpretation of the observed deformations.
Tables 4 X 7 and Fig. 7 manifest that multicollinearity may not significantly affect the fitting ability of regression models but may affect the estimation of regression coefficients, which is the reason why the deformation contributed by external loads are difficult to single out when multicollinearity exists. In light of these concerns, we therefore cannot evaluate the performance of our models when only the fitting accuracy is considered ( Wu and Han, 1996 ). In this case, although ordinary SIMPLS has the minimum RMSEP and highest R (see Tables 5 and 7 ), we prefer the GA/SIMPLS model with fewer variables and PCs because the
GA/SIMPLS can simplify the dam statistical model and can describe the dam behaviour reasonably well.

Once the load X  X eformation relationship is established through regression analysis, the crack opening contributions by the differ-ent causative factors can be separated. Fig. 8 shows the results of our proposed model with the test data of point No. 31. The results indicate that the deformation caused by the thermal load appears periodically and is proportional to the crack opening. We found that the dam crack opening propagates with temperature varia-tion, and it is prone to create crack openings in winter (or summer) owing to freezing (or moisture loss) of the earth material under the reinforced concrete face. We also found that among the loads acting on the dam, ageing plays an essential role in creating crack openings and its contribution stabilises with time. These conclusions match the deformation trend of the earth-rock dam.
On the basis of the preceding analyses, we used the past data obtained by regressive analysis to establish empirical prediction models to predict the behaviour of the dam. As shown in Fig. 9 ,the prediction for the period of 3 July  X 29 December indicates that our models can capture the trend in the observed response of cracks with time, although slight discrepancies may still exist between the prediction models and the actual deformations, especially for the ordinary SIMPLS model. We should mention that the crack Crack Opening (mm) openings obtained herein are only caused by external loads with analytical functions, whose parameters do not have any physical meaning ( De Sortisa and Paolianib, 2007 ). This main drawback may sometimes prevent us from predicting unexpected dam crack openings, e.g. those caused by the uneven settlement of the foundation. Thus a combination of deterministic models with finite element analysis is often recommended in the physical interpretation and prediction of dam deformation ( Chrzanowski et al., 1991 ; Chrzanowski and Szostak-Chrzanowski, 1993 ). 4. Conclusions
This study extends the methods of genetic algorithm with partial least squares (GA-PLS) and statistically inspired modifica-tion of PLS algorithm (SIMPLS) to dam deformation analysis. A SIMPLS regression with the predictor variables selected by GA-PLS (hybrid GA/SIMPLS regression) has been proposed to cope with the multicollinearity problem of dam regression models. A case study using the observations of an earth-rock dam in China has been presented and discussed to examine the performance of the proposed model. The benefits of GA-PLS in selecting informative variables for the prediction of dam crack openings have been highlighted. The performance of the hybrid GA/SIMPLS, ordinary SIMPLS, and stepwise regression have been compared. The results show the proposed model can be used as an alternative regression tool to that commonly being used in dam deformation analysis.
