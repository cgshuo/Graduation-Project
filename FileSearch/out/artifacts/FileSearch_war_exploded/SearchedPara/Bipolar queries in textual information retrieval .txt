 1. Introduction
We consider the standard task of information retrieval (IR), i.e., finding textual documents relevant for the user X  X  needs and intentions expressed in the form of a query. There are many problems to be solved to provide the user with an effective response to his/her query. Some, exemplified by a short response time, are technical and are implied by the sheer volume of information (textual) resources to be searched. Here, we are dealing with a presumably more fundamental problem of how to express  X  X  X eal X  X  information needs of the human user to reflect his/her real intentions and preferences.
We will first discuss some basic facts related to our points of departure. Essentially, an ultimate solution to the problem of an effective search would presumably be related to the nascent Semantic Web technology. Namely, the majority of the tex-tual resources will presumably be annotated which will make it possible to base the retrieval process on the semantic con-tents of the documents. Clearly, semantics is what really matters though issues related to, for instance, syntax, are also relevant.

However, presently we can practically depend only on the basic keyword based search. We assume it here as a point of departure and propose a new approach which can make search more effective (more human consistent, or intelligent) by augmenting the standard keyword based search with some nonstandard extensions.

First, we consider here an extension of the classical Boolean model of information retrieval in which keywords are as-count for a gradual nature of both the keyword importance for the representation of documents as well as a gradual nature of the concept of relevance. Moreover, this quite general approach may be easily interpreted in terms of fuzzy logic (cf., e.g., also in queries as proposed by Bordogna and Pasi (2000) , and recently extended by Zadro _ zny and Kacprzyk (2009c) . One can also mention here some other applications of fuzzy logic for information retrieval exemplified by Radecki (1979), Kraft and
Buell (1983), Yager (1987), Ogawa, Morita, and Kobayashi (1991), Bordogna, Carrara, and Pasi (1991), Bordogna and Pasi  X  (1993), Kraft et al. (1994), Kraft, Bordogna, and Pasi (1999), Bordogna, Bosc, and Pasi (2000), Herrera-Viedma (2001), Liau and Yao (2001) . Recently, a more general fuzzy model, based on Zadeh X  X  calculus of linguistic statements, has been proposed by Nowacka, Zadro _ zny, and Kacprzyk (2008) , and then comprehensively presented by Zadro _ zny and Nowacka (2009) . How-ever, all the above approaches to the inclusion of imprecision and flexibility to the queries have boiled down to a straight-forward  X  X  X oftening X  X  (fuzzification) of a querying condition, either a simple one or compound, in terms of a Kacprzyk and Zadro _ zny (1995), Kacprzyk and Zadro _ zny (2001) taxonomy of flexible database queries.

We consider here a basic fuzzy IR model, with a classical fuzzy logic based document representation and crisp Boolean queries, but enhanced with a special logical type connective modeling a bipolar character of information needs, intentions and preferences of the human user.

There is much evidence, reported notably by social scientists, psychologists or cognitive scientists, that a human being in his/her judgments, assessments or opinions is usually using a kind of a bipolar scale meant as that some objects, values of their features, etc. are best assessed or evaluated by:
As obvious and simple as it is, bipolarity has many aspects which have to be taken into account. In particular, we can devise various models of bipolarity meant as, first of all, the use of a proper scale to describe the phenomenon. Two such models (scales) are usually considered, cf. ( Grabisch, Greco, &amp; Pirlot, 2008 ):
The former model assumes one scale with three main levels of a negative, neutral and positive evaluation, respectively, gradually changing from one end of the scale to another. The latter model assumes two more or less independent scales which separately account for a positive and negative evaluation. Usually, in the former case the interval [ 1,1] is used, and in the latter  X  two separate intervals [0,1] are used. The second model is more general and may be more convenient if the user prefers to express separately his/her positive and negative evaluations that may be more natural than to assume their aggregate representation. We will adopt it in this paper to handle bipolarity, in particular because our approach is based on an explicit handling of the positive and negative evaluations.

Bipolarity is widely acknowledged as an important aspect to be be taken into account during information processing. Re-and preferences (the user X  X  needs and intentions) representation. We are mainly interested in the latter problem, directly corresponding to the notion of querying in IR. To make things more realistic, we assume that information is both bipolar and fuzzy.

Our point of departure for this paper is a conceptually similar, and related, problem of involving bipolarity in database querying. The roots of bipolarity in querying go back to the early 2000s, and the idea is due to Dubois and Prade (2002) , ex-tended by them in Dubois and Prade (2008) and in some more general contexts in Dubois and Prade (2009) . This has been followed by much work, notably exemplified by De Tr X  et al. (2009), Zadro _ zny (2005), Zadro _ zny and Kacprzyk (2006) , etc.
By following the line of research on bipolar querying of databases as mentioned above ( Dubois &amp; Prade, 2002; Zadro _ zny, 2005 ), we use here a bipolar keyword based query which in IR may be meant in the following way. It contains a part (a com-bination of keywords) which, when satisfied by a document, contributes to the positive evaluation of this document by a user, and another part (another combination of keywords) which, when satisfied by a document, contributes to the negative evaluation of this document. This is the motivation for the use of the term  X  X  X ipolar X  X  to characterize queries comprising such opposite parts.

The question is how such a query should be processed and, in particular, how the matching of the documents against it should be determined. This may be done in many different ways, starting with the simplest conjunction of both parts of the query: the former taken directly and the latter negated. However, this may not properly represent the intentions of the user and therefore we focus here on a more realistic, and more sophisticated, aggregation of these two parts of a bipolar query, which assumes a specific interpretation of them. Namely, one part part of the query may be termed mandatory , and the an-other optional . The former part is meant as specifying the negative information in the sense that documents not satisfying it given document (among those non rejected ones through the former condition; however  X  X  X mong X  X  have to be properly inter-preted taking into account the fact that the notion of (non-) rejection is a matter of degree here).
The two main lines of research on such a specific interpretation of bipolar queries may be distinguished: the one concern-ing a very important aspect of a proper theoretical modeling of such bipolar queries ( Dubois &amp; Prade, 2009 ), and the one focusing on the problem of a proper combination (aggregation of respective matching degrees) of the negative and positive information when they are fuzzy, or gradual ( Zadro _ zny, 2005 ).

We pursue in this paper mostly the latter path, which is presumably more relevant for practice, and also closer to our research interests. Specifically, we define a bipolar query in the above mentioned sense as the one containing a connective (aggregation operator) meant to aggregate the matching degrees separately induced by the negative and positive informa-tion (preferences). Due to a qualitatively different nature of bipolar evaluations, a crucial problem is how to combine (aggre-gate) them. In the context of queries, this concerns how to aggregate the bipolar evaluations of elementary conditions comprising the whole query, and/or how to order query results with respect to the bipolar evaluations. The analysis of pos-reasoning related to bipolarity seems to be more useful and natural an interpretation in the IR context.
The structure of this basic paper, which is intended to propose a conceptually new approach to bipolar queries in IR, is as follows. In Section 2 we discuss some main concepts and points of departure relevant for our research, notably various as-pects of bipolarity and its modeling in the context of database querying. In Section 3 we briefly review the basic IR model in Section 5 we discuss how bipolar queries may be efficiently executed against collections of textual documents. We con-clude the paper with a summary of our work. 2. A concept of a bipolar database query: the point of departure In this section we will briefly review the concept of a bipolar query in the database context, focusing on our former works. This will provide a proper point of departure for our new concept of a bipolar query in IR to be proposed.
Basically, we identify a query with a condition expressing what the user is looking for. The response to a query is a list of tuples satisfying this condition which is usually composed of a few, simple, atomic conditions putting some constraints on connectives of conjunction, disjunction and negation.
 when the salary and the height of an employee are considered, respectively. Thus, it is assumed that fuzzy sets, A 2 are defined for some attributes, characterized by their membership functions l a given attribute and F  X  U  X  denotes a set of fuzzy sets defined in the universe U . Then, a matching degree of an employee (of the record representing him/her, to be precise) against an atomic condition involving a given fuzzy predicate is identified ees are sought, then the matching degree is computed as the membership function of the ployee to a fuzzy set representing the concept of  X  X  X oung X  X .
 Clearly, in this classical fuzzy approach a unipolar scale is tacitly assumed. Namely, l given attribute value is compatible with the meaning of a given linguistic term and, in consequence, the degree to which this ( X  X  X ccepted X  X ,  X  X  X ood X  X ) attribute values.

The essence of bipolarity, in the context of database querying, is to distinguish the negative and positive assessments of data. Different kinds of bipolar queries may be identified depending on the type of a bipolar scale used to express assess-case the assessment is expressed as one number from a fixed interval, e.g., [ 1,1], and this interval is divided into three zones expressing the negative (negative numbers), neutral (number 0) and positive (positive numbers) assessments, respec-tively. In case of the unipolar bivariate scale, the positive and negative assessments are expressed separately on two unipolar scales. Thus, the user may independently express a degree to which a given object is appealing and repulsive, respectively, to him/her.

In the latter case, a special interpretation of the positive and negative evaluation is often adopted. In this special inter-pretation, the negative and positive assessments are treated as corresponding to required and preferred conditions, respec-tively. Thus, the former condition has to be satisfied necessarily and the latter one only if possible . The negative assessment in this interpretation is identified with the degree to which the required condition is not satisfied. The preferred condition, on the other hand, characterizes those tuples which are just desired, with an understanding that the violation of such a condition by a tuple does not necessarily exclude it from considerations. Notice that the very sense of this interpre-tation does preclude a straightforward, yet misleading assumption that the positive is a direct negation of the negative assessment.

In this paper we focus on this special interpretation of bipolar queries. This interpretation can be made operational in a few different ways. In Dubois and Prade (2002) approach it is performed through the use of the well known and widely used matching of the preferred condition is used to further order them.

Another approach, followed also in this paper, was originally proposed by Lacroix and Lavency (1987) . It consists in com-bining matching degrees of both conditions using a special aggregation operator which will be referred to as  X  X  X nd possibly X  X .
Thus, the bipolar query may be exemplified by the following query to a database on real-estate properties: ment is identified with the degree to which it is located near the station .

In what follows the required condition will be denoted by C and the preferred one by P . The bipolar query is viewed as the pair of such conditions and is denoted as ( C , P ).

The  X  X  X nd possibly X  X  term appearing in (1) is meant as an operator aggregating the matching degrees of conditions C and P , this operator. The semantics of the the bipolar query reduces to the simple conjunction C ^ P . Therefore, the most interesting are intermediate cases which may with the  X  X  X nd possibly X  X  operator or as  X  X  X  and possibly P X  X  queries .

In the original (crisp) approach by Lacroix and Lavency (1987) semantics of the aggregation using the  X  X  X nd possibly X  X  by the following logical formula:
Such an aggregation operator has been later proposed independently by Dubois and Prade (1988) in the context of default reasoning and by Yager (1992), and Yager (1996) in the context of the multicriteria decision making for the case of so-called tuple satisfies P under the condition that it satisfies C , which may be expressed as Poss ( P j C ) = max such a possibility the lower the interference, i.e., there are tuples satisfying both the conditions C and P .
Thus, a special interpretation of bipolar queries which is considered here is directly related to the possibility theory ( Za-deh, 1978 ), the applicability of which for the information retrieval purposes has been confirmed by many publications; cf., e.g., ( Zadro _ zny &amp; Nowacka, 2009 ) and references therein.

In Zadro _ zny (2005), and Zadro _ zny and Kacprzyk (2006) we proposed a  X  X  X uzzification X  X  of (3) and studied its basic prop-erties. More information on this and other approaches to bipolarity of user preferences in queries to databases may be found, e.g., in Zadro _ zny and Kacprzyk (2009a) . We also give some more details in Section 4 while presenting our concept of bipolar queries for information retrieval. 3. A fuzzy Boolean information retrieval model
Our goal is to propose the concept of a bipolar query in the framework of a fuzzy extension of the classical Boolean model of IR. This extension may be briefly defined in the following way which is very convenient for our considerations  X  cf. ( Zadro _ zny &amp; Kacprzyk, 2009c ).

First, the classical Boolean model is defined in the framework of the classical propositional calculus. Each keyword t which is used to represent documents and to form queries, is identified with a propositional variable s d 2 D is identified with a valuation: such that x d ( s i ) = 1 if keyword t i is deemed to be important to represent the content of document d , and x
A query q is expressed as a formula built of the propositional variables s
A query q is said to match a document d if and only if the formula corresponding to q is true under the valuation asso-ciated with d .

For example, if a document is represented by a valuation x ( t q = t 1 ^ t 3 is false under the valuation represented by d , and thus d does not match q under d , and will be considered to be matching this document.
 The simplest fuzzy logic based extension of this model is to assume a fuzzy multivalued propositional logic framework.
Then, particular keywords may be indicated as important for the representation of a document to a degree , from [0,1], from 0 for unimportant to 1 for fully important through all intermediate values.

A document d is still represented by a valuation which now is the function
Therefore, a document d is now represented by a valuation x this representation.

The form of a query is the same as in the classical Boolean model and the matching between a query and a document is still equated with the truth value of the formula representing the query under the valuation representing the document. The truth of the formula is now expressed by a number from the interval [0,1] which makes it possible to model a gradual nature of relevance. This truth degree is referred to as a matching degree of a query q and a document d that is defined as the truth value of q under the valuation x d representing d . It is calculated by interpreting the logical connectives using the standard operators of fuzzy logic, i.e., e.g., the conjunction and disjunction equated with the minimum and maximum which may be generalized by a t -norm and t -conorm Klement, Mesiar, and Pap (2000) , respectively.

Thus, the multivalued logic provides a formal framework for the concept of a gradual importance and matching (rele-vance). However, the problem of how the weights are actually assigned to the keywords representing documents is beyond our scope. In general, a function F is assumed such that: and F ( d , t ) denotes the weight which is assigned to a term t in a document d .

In particular, one of the weighting schemes developed within the vector space model may be adopted. A popular choice for F may be the well-known tf IDF scheme with a proper normalization to obtain weights from [0,1].

This short exposition of our point of departure will now be used to introduce the concept of a bipolar query in the context of IR. An interesting overview of various non-standard logical IR models may be found in Lalmas (1998) . 4. A concept of a bipolar query in information retrieval Our concept of a bipolar query in IR is inspired by its counterpart considered in the context of databases ( Zadro _ zny, on bipolar queries with the  X  X  X nd possibly X  X  operator presented in Section 2 We will repeat some arguments from this section for the convenience of the reader.

We define a bipolar query q , in the IR context, as a query with two parts which, when evaluated for a given document, yield, respectively, its positive and negative assessment with respect to the query. The way both evaluations should be taken into account in the ordering of the documents in response to the user query depends on the assumed interpretation of the averse and risk-prone decision makers considered in the context of decision making under risk.

Thus, in general, for a textual document we have its two evaluations against a bipolar query. We can process them inde-pendently or aggregate them to obtain one overall evaluation. We will focus on the latter option and, moreover, we will con-sider one special way of aggregation, which is introduced already in Section 2 by formulas (2), (3) . We will now discuss its interpretation in the context of information retrieval.

Thus, the adopted interpretation of the bipolar query is best described and discussed in terms of the  X  X  and possibly  X  X  con-denote this connective as ^ p . The study of bipolar queries of this special type thus boils down to the study of properties of this connective.

Hence, in what follows we will consider a bipolar query q in the following form: where q C and q P will be referred to as subqueries and will be assumed to be the regular Boolean queries. In a general case, these subqueries may in turn be bipolar queries, i.e., may contain the ^ of a larger query; cf. an example at the end of this section.
 The first subquery q C is meant as a constraint, i.e., for a document to match the whole query q it is required to match q
The second subquery q P is taken into account only if the former is satisfied. More precisely, the influence of the second sub-query q P on the result of the matching of the query q depends on the content of the whole collection of documents. Namely, if there are documents matching both subqueries, then the subquery q uments matching both the subqueries should be considered relevant. Otherwise, i.e., if there is a conflict in the matching of both subqueries at the same time, then the second subquery is ignored. However, as the matching of a query is the matter of a degree in an extended Boolean model considered here, then all intermediate cases are possible, i.e., the second subquery q may influence the matching degree of the whole query to some degree between 0 and 1.
 The bipolar character of the query (6) may be summarized as follows. A subquery q negative evaluation of a document because the documents which do not satisfy it are treated as not matching the whole query and are rejected. A subquery q P , on the other hand, provides for the positive evaluation of a document as a document matching it is preferred over another document not matching it, provided both the documents match the required subquery q . Clearly, the negative evaluation concerns the negation of the  X  X  X equired X  X  condition and also  X  as already mentioned  X  the negative assessment is not the negation of the positive one.

The semantics of the bipolar query may also be expressed in the following way: the answer to the query (6) is a set of documents that match the usual conjunction of subqueries q set of documents that match the subquery q C alone. If all these sets are fuzzy, it is impractical to use the criterion of the uments being an answer to such a query in the following way: where q C ( d ) and q P ( d ) denote that a document d 2 D satisfies the corresponding subquery.

In order to make the formula (7) operational and human consistent, all logical symbols appearing therein, i.e., the con-resented by the minimum operator (a t -norm, in general) and the existential quantifier is represented by the maximum operator (a t -conorm, in general).

What concerns the implication, ) , there is some freedom of choice. In fuzzy logic there are basically three classes of fuzzy implications (cf. for instance the best known book on fuzzy implications ( Baczynski &amp; Jayaram, 2008 ) though these classes have been introduced in some much earlier works by Trillas): applications, and their choice is case dependent.

In this paper we use the standard t -norm (minimum) and t -conorm (maximum) operators and the Kleene X  X ienes impli-context of IR is not always straightforward and will be considered in subsequent papers.

Therefore, for the standard t -norm (minimum) and t -conorm (maximum) operators and the implication operator x ) y = max (1 x , y ) one obtains the following formula for computing the matching degree md ( d , q ) between a document d and a bipolar query q = q C ^ p q P : where md ( d , q ) denotes the matching degree between a document d and a query q . All logical symbols in (7) , i.e., the con-^ is meant here as a t -norm (e.g., the minimum operator) and the existential quantifier is meant as t -conorm (e.g., the max-imum operator) acting on a set of arguments. In Zadro _ zny and Kacprzyk (2007) and Zadro _ zny and Kacprzyk (2009b) the reader may find a detailed discussion of other possible choices of the operators to model logical connectives; it concerns the bipolar queries against databases, but the findings are immediately applicable in the IR context considered here.
In case of the Boolean representation of documents, a bipolar query may be executed using the two step procedure: first take all documents satisfying the subquery q C , and then, in the second step, choose from among them those which also sat-isfy the subquery q P . If such documents exist, they form the answer to the query. Otherwise, the whole set of documents satisfying q C is an answer.

The situation is more complicated if the conditions C and P are assumed to be fuzzy  X  then in the first step we obtain a fuzzy set of documents satisfying C to a degree and then the operation of  X  X  X hoosing from among them X  X  have to be properly understood. The formula (8) provides then a convenient scalar evaluation of a bipolar query in line with the semantics of the  X  X  X nd possibly X  X  connective ^ p discussed above.

An important property of the ^ p connective is that it is clearly not truth functional: the overall matching degree depends not only on the values of its  X  X  X xplicit X  X  arguments, i.e., md ( d , q of the the documents D : in particular on the truth of the $ e ( q interpretation of the logical symbols), on the value of max The latter value is worth a further analysis. If it is equal 0, then the whole bipolar query q turns into the subquery q is a property of the fuzzy implication operator ) , appearing in formula (7) . This is at the same time in accordance with the assumed semantics of the operator ^ p ,as $ CP equal 0 means that it is not possible to match both subqueries (there are no such documents in the collection D ).

Two reasons may be distinguished for $ CP to take value 0: 1. there does not exists at all a document matching the subquery q 2. the sets of documents matching these two subqueries are disjoint.

In practice, it is worth informing the user which situation occurs. It gives the user an additional insight into the coverage of the domain of interest by the queried collection of documents.

The queries submitted to a textual information retrieval system may be either  X  X  X anually X  X  constructed using a query language (of the Boolean formulas, in the case considered here) or may be automatically derived on the basis of, e.g., a short text, with the aim to find related documents (cf. also, e.g., Cord X n, Herrera-Viedma, &amp; Luque, 2006 for some other way of an automatic generation of a Boolean query). In both scenarios, the bipolar queries seem to be applicable and useful. Obviously, the former scenario provides the main motivation for studying this type of queries. The need to take bipolarity into account in information processing, notably in preferences representation, is widely advocated  X  cf. user.Itmakesitpossibletodistinguishtwosubqueriesasdifferentintheirimportancefortheinformationneedsoftheuser,but this difference in importance automatically adjusts itself to the content of the collection of documents.
A problem of the automatic construction of a query in the Boolean information retrieval model is not trivial. Usually, a subset of keywords is extracted from a short text being a starting point for such a construction. Then this subset of keywords
Bordogna, Carrara, and Pasi (1995), and Bordogna and Pasi (2000) , and then further extended by Nowacka et al. (2008) , and notably Zadro _ zny and Nowacka (2009) . Then, a query composed of the above mentioned subset of keywords matches a doc-ument if, e.g., most of the keywords appear in this document. This sets much more relaxed constraints in comparison to the conjunction alone and makes for a much more reasonable representation of the original short text.

The use of a bipolar query in this scenario may provide even greater a flexibility. The extracted subset of keywords may be divided into two sets which form two subqueries: the first one is the conjunction of the required keywords while the second is the disjunction of the preferred keywords. This is in the spirit of semantics of the bipolar queries discussed in the framework of database querying; cf. Section 2 and, e.g., ( Dubois &amp; Prade, 2002 ). The partition of the keywords may be done by using different criteria. The simplest one is to form groups of keywords depending on their importance weights, computed (for the short text on which the query is based) using one of the vector space model weighting algorithms, cf. ( Baeza-Yates &amp; Ribeiro-Neto, 1999 ). More sophisticated approaches may refer to the thesaurus but this will not be considered here.

The following simple example illustrates the concept of a bipolar query with the  X  X  X nd possibly X  X  operator, and shows some of relevant properties.
 Let us consider the following sets: D ={ d 1 , d 2 , d 3 } is a set of documents, which are represented using a set of keywords
We will consider the following queries:
Columns 5 X 10 of Table 1 show the matching degrees of all the documents against all the queries. These matching degrees are computed using the formula (8) .

The following properties of the connective ^ p may be easily observed looking at the results shown in Table 1: For the query q 6 the value of $ CP , i.e., of max e 2 D min (md( e , q ular conjunction t 1 ^ t 6 . On the other hand, for the query q query behaves  X  X  X lmost like X  X  q = t 1 .
 5. Aspects of implementation of bipolar queries in the IR context
Now we will present the concept of a bipolar query introduced in this paper in the context of the inverted file structure to provide a realistic framework within which our new concept can be analyzed and implemented.

The bipolar queries presented in Section 4 may be processed using the inverted file structure in the following way. For a bipolar query q with a required subquery q C and a preferred subquery q (pointers to the documents) are obtained via the processing of these subqueries which are assumed to be the regular Boolean queries or the weighted Boolean queries.
 Then, the height H of the intersection of these two sets (lists) is computed, i.e., In the next step the membership degrees of all the documents to the set L where i is an implication operator modeling the implication connective ) in (7) , e.g., i ( x , y ) = max (1 x , y ).
Finally, the intersection of the sets (lists) L C and L P
Thus, in comparison to a query in the form of the regular conjunction, the computational complexity for the bipolar query processing remains the same.

This concludes the presentation of our proposal of the new concept of a bipolar query for IR which is based on a specific interpretation of bipolarity of query conditions and of the  X  X  X nd possibly X  X  type aggregation of them, which are the founda-tions of our previous approach to bipolar database queries.

The foundational character of the paper has resulted in simple examples to best show the essence of the proposal. As a next step one can expect more comprehensive numerical tests on benchmarks to better justify the usefulness of the query type proposed. Unfortunately, this may need a serious efforts to develop some benchmarks for the bipolar querying, both in the context of databases and IR, which may be a difficult task and may take much time. Our numerical tests performed so far have already shown very good properties of the new bipolar query but, by necessity, the scope of the tests has been limited so far to small text corpora. A final proof of usefulness will certainly be a real world example of an appropriate size. 6. Conclusion
We presented a novel concept of a bipolar query in the textual information retrieval framework by extending our previ-ous works on the bipolar queries in the database context. Our approach boils down to a proper definition of the  X  X  X nd pos-sibly X  X  aggregation operator (connective) to combine the negative and positive conditions. We used the idea of an approach to its modeling presented in our previous works on bipolar queries for database, tailored it to the IR context, and presented in a uniform way.

The concept of bipolar queries in IR is introduced in a general form, however the focus of the paper is on just one special first, a further conceptual and analytic study of the concept of a bipolar query in IR in its most general form, and  X  second  X  an analysis of practical issues related to the implementation of this concept. Among the latter, an important question con-cerns an automatic derivation of bipolar queries based on short texts, possibly taking into account the history of querying, etc. This latter line of research is expected to include also some other important tasks of information retrieval, notably text categorization, where the links with the notion of bipolarity are evident. And last but not least, the development of proper benchmarks for bipolar querying in both databases and IR is a very relevant issue for further research.
