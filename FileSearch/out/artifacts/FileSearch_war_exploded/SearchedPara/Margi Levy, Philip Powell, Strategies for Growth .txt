 Margi Levy, Philip Powell, Strategies for Growth in SMEs: The Role of Information and Information Systems, ISBN: 0750663510, $49.95 I highly recommend this book to any researcher of IS in small firms.

One of the few things that I can fault with this book is its title. I think that the first part of the title is par-ticularly misleading and, hopefully, IS researchers will not miss this book when scanning titles about small firms. To me, the title seems more likely to catch the attention of strategy and entrepreneurship readers. This is a book by IS researchers for IS researchers. Eventhe authors admit that many small firms do not seek growth.
Other books do exist that focus on small firm IS research but this one takes the quality to a new and much higher level. Most of this book is based around the analysis of findings from 68 case firms and some readers may recognize parts of the book from earlier journal papers by the authors. Like other books, the chapters examine many different aspects of IS. For example, there are chapters on: IS strategy, IS planning, alignment, knowledge sharing, core-competencies, BPR, and e-business. It is a broad range of topics that mean that it is highly likely that there is at least one chapter in this book that is particularly relevant to any IS research project in small firms. However, it is the depth and range of the analysis and subsequent dis-cussion that places this book above others.

The book is also well rounded. For example, the first four chapters are very much about SMEs and IS and would thus serve as an excellent introduction to the topic for the novice researcher of small firms. A concern is that Levy and Powell  X  s definition of an SME includes firms that are subsidiaries of larger firms. This may be inappropriate for some studies, where a researcher may wish to examine firms that are free from such influences (e.g., free from IS systems and procedures being imposed on the firm by another com-pany that has a much more sophisticated IT infrastructure, including IS people and skills).

Who will use this book? Possibly the biggest audience will be IS thesis students. I hope that all thesis students who plan to research IS in small firms will read this book. I have already shared a copy with some of my students and they praised the book and wish to photocopy parts of it. One commented that the book was very user friendly X  X lear format, summaries at the end of chapter and easy to read.

A colleague wants to take another look at the extensive bibliography and to read the final chapter again, which focuses on the future, so discussessome of themany opportunities for researchers. Thus I hope that many University libraries buy a copy of this book for their IS thesis students and IS researchers. Thesis supervisors could also keep a copy on their shelves to lend to thesis students. I am confident that my copy will be well used.
The book may also be a wonderful teaching resource for an IS research course (i.e., a postgraduate course for potential thesis students). I will definitely consider it as the main text for our postgraduate paper on IS Management.

The authors also hope that advisors to small firms will read and use this book. I suspect that some practi-tioners may find uses for parts of the book but many practitioners will find the book too research oriented. To me the rigor of the research is a major strength of the book, but could make it less readable to non-researchers. I congratulate the authors on providing IS researchers with such a wonderful resource.
