 We now summarize our motivations for doing so, and then outli ne our contribution. algorithms provide a promising alternative to current sche duling algorithms. framework in which to investigate such connections. 1.1 Our contributions This estimate is correct when the original graph is bipartit e. reduction will prove useful from both practical and analyti cal perspectives. A subset of V will be represented by vector x = ( x subset x in the subset are connected by an edge: ( x integrality constraints x linear program by LP . The dual of LP is denoted below by DUAL .

Example. Let y where the  X  are any real numbers. The corresponding e G is shown to the right. Let c be any number such that c +  X  are all greater than 0.
