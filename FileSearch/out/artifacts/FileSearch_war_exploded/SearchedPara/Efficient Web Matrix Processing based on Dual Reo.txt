 PageRank is one of the most important ranking techniques used in search engines nowadays. Since billions of pages already existed in Web, many PageRank acceleration tech-niques were explored by many researchers. However, in the there are many pages without in-links. (In this paper, a Given the state of the art, we propose a new reordered PageRank algorithm, called two-way reordered PageRank algorithm, which exploits both dangling nodes and reverse-dangling nodes to reduce the computational complexity of the PageRank vector.

With the exponential growth of the World Wide Web, looking for informative pages with high relevance in the Web has become an important research field. Due to the success query time, PageRank [4] is one of the most important rank-of pages already existed in Web, computing the PageRank vector is very time-consuming procedure. How to accelerate the computation of the PageRank vector has been deemed to be an important issue.

Recently, in [2], Langville and Meyer extended Lee et al. X  X  work [3] to propose a reordered PageRank algorithm. Ex-plicitly, the reordered PageRank algorithm reduces the com-putation of the PageRank vector to that of solving a much smaller system by permuting the indices of Web pages list. This reordered algorithm produces an efficient alternative to the original PageRank problem, and offers a new PageR-duce computation of the PageRank vector. However, in the there are many pages without in-links. (In this paper, a Given the state of the art, we want to address the important question: Can we improve the computation of PageRank vector by using some symmetric reordering method on both the dangling and reverse-dangling pages?
In this paper, we propose a new symmetric reordering method, called two-way reordered PageRank algorithm , which exploits both reverse-dangling nodes and dangling nodes to accelerate the computation of the PageRank vector. The proposed approach can translate the problem of computing PageRank vector to that of solving a much smaller system than the prior work in [2]. Therefore, the proposed Web ma-significantly outperform the prior methods and obtain the PageRank vector with much shorter execution time. The PageRank is a global ranking method based on the Web X  X  hyperlink structure. In this paper we use the usual directed graph model for representing the hyperlink struc-ture of the Web. Let G = ( V, E ) be the Web graph with senting hyperlinks between pages. Thus, the Web graph can number of nodes of the Web graph G , and ( i, j )  X  E means that there is a link from page i to page j . The matrix H is nonnegative, sparse, and row normalized. The positive ele-the positive elements of column i correspond to the in-links of page i . Hence, the matrix H contains a zero column for each node without in-links (i.e., a reverse-dangling node), and contains a zero row for each node without out-links (i.e., a dangling node). Since there are dangling nodes and reverse-dangling nodes in the Web, H contains many zero columns and zero rows.

In PageRank, the importance of page i is determined by The PageRank value of a page i , denoted  X  i , is defined as the following model: where  X  T = (  X  1 ,  X  2 ,  X  X  X  ,  X  n ), G =  X  S + (1  X   X  ) ev node and 0 otherwise,  X  is a scalar between 0 and 1, and v is a probability vector with positive elements. That is, the PageRank model is the long run behavior of a random surfer who occasionally teleports to another page instead of following a link.  X  is a parameter that controls the prob-ability of time the random surfer follows the hyperlinks as opposed to teleporting. The vector v is called the personal-will be visited along a surfer teleporting.

According to Eq. (1), PageRank computation is equiva-lent to the problem of finding the dominant eigenvector of a stochastic matrix. However, Theorem 1 below states that the eigenvector problem can be rewritten as a very sparse linear system formulation.

Theorem 1. ([1], page 73) Let  X  x be the solution of the linear system Then  X  x T / k  X  x T k 1 is the PageRank vector, where k  X  x  X  x e , and e is the column vector of all 1 s.
Recall that the hyperlink matrix H contains a zero row node, respectively. Consequently, we can use the following dual reordering technique to speed up the computation of PageRank vector.
 Two-Way Reordering Method. 1. We permute the indices of pages so that the reverse-dangling nodes are arranged to the front whereas the dan-gling ones are put in the rear of the page list. 2. Consider the Web subgraph that we remove the reverse-dangling nodes and dangling nodes (which are found in last step), and their link arcs from the Web graph. The last process of relocating nodes for those nodes without in-links or out-links will be repeated recursively on a continuously smaller subgraph, until a subgraph is created that each node has positive in-degree and out-degree, or after some prede-fined iterations.

If we use the two-way reordering method to permute the indices of Web pages, the hyperlink matrix H should have the upper-triangular structure as shown in Figure 1 for some k , where b 1 is the number of square diagonal blocks in the reordered matrix and k is a integer between 1 and b 1 . As such, after using the two-way reordering method, the PageR-ank linear system in Eq. (2) can be solved by forward sub-stitution. ( x T and v T have also been partitioned accord-ing to the number and size of the blocks.) The only sys-tem that must be solved is this smaller subsystem, x T k in x We call the reordered PageRank algorithm based on the two-way reordering technique as two-way reordered PageRank al-gorithm .
