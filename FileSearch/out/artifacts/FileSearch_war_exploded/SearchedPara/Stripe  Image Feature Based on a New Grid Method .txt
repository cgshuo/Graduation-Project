 ImageCLEF 1 is a part of Cross language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) and includes two parts: Adhoc (for historic photographs) and ImageCLEFmed (for medical image retrieval and annotation). In 2005, 13 groups from the world joined its medical image retrieval task, and 12 groups joined the annotation task. 
Whatever the methods they used, the common basic problem is how to choose and calculate image features. Some features (like Blob, image patches, etc.) are powerful medical images. To explore more efficient features will be a permanent objective for the researchers in this field. ImageCLEF. Then we will give our solution for a fast and efficient image feature. 1.1 Image Features Used in ImageCLEF In [2], based on some small regions/blocks like 5x5 or 3x3, HSV histogram (16x4x4), Canny edges (8 directions) and texture (first 5 DCT coefficients, each quantized into 3 values) are used. Then the three components are connected to a feature vector. 
In [3], all the images are resized into 256x256 at first. Then they are divided into smaller blocks with the size 8x8. Average gray values of the blocks are taken to form the image feature vector. horizontal axes to form the feature vector. layout feature. Further more, color histogram, global texture descriptors, and invariant coarseness, contrast, directionality, line-likeness, regularity, and roughness. In [7], Gabor features and Tamura features are used. 
In [8], there are following features: global texture features based on co-occurrence features based on 7 invariant moments. 
In [9], Tamura features, in which only 3 features are chosen: coarseness, contrast, 256x256, ignoring the aspect ratio. connection, color histogram. 
In [11], after partitioning the images successively into four equally sized regions (4 and local features are both considered. contrast, anisotropy, and polarity. Image patches [13] and random sub-windows [14] are also used in ImageCLEF pixel gray values of the small blocks. For image patches, salient points are extracted at first in the work of [13]. 
According to the last report of ImageCLEF X  X  committee, in visual-only medical image retrieval task, Blob features reached the highest position in 2005; in annotation searching more efficient features. We put forward the  X  X tripe X . 1.2 Stripe: An Efficient Feature Based on a New Grid Method of Images the cells of grids. To make it easily handled, histogram of each cell is calculated and queues in order and forms a feature vector. 
Compared with other image features, stripes have following characteristics: Stripe is a kind of local feature of images. To generate it, firstly we divide an image into regions; secondly we choose suitable features to represent the regions.  X  X tripes X : Horizontal, vertical, square-cirque, left-tilt, right-tilt. 2.1 Horizontal and Vertical Stripes In this case, we use straight lines equally to divide an image into some horizontal and while sometimes except the last region, because of different image sizes in an image should be bigger if the image gray values vary a lot in the regions. first ( m -1) bins are needed because the total sum should be 1. Then the feature vector will be (P 1,1 ...P n, m -1 ) which is derived from the following queue: 2.2 Square-Cirque Stripes As shown in Fig.1 (c), the stripes start from the center/core of the image. When users give the number of stripes in an image, the widths of the stripes are correspondingly other stripes have the same width in the horizontal and vertical directions separately. skull, heart, etc. It is useful to distinguish skull from chest x-ray. generate the square-cirque feature vector is similar to section 2.1. 2.3 Left-and Right-Tilt Stripes examples. Statistics following the direction of tilt angles will make the feature vector more meaningful. And it can decrease the influence of the white border regions. 
Though there are different rotation angles for different images, only  X 45 X  lines are tilt program can be reused to calculate right-tilt stripes. queue is up-to-bottom. 2.4 Stripe Feature Vector for an Image users just need to define two parameters: N s  X  X he number of stripes for each kind, and N are symmetric to axes. Then it is clear that the image sizes won X  X  influence the feature We apply the stripe feature method in to some tasks of ImageCLEF. The first experiment is based on the medical image retrieval task in 2004; the second experiment is based on the medical annotation task in 2006. The effect of stripes is compared with other features and the system performance is evaluated correspondingly. 3.1 ImageCLEF 2004: Medical Image Retrieval Task result is from GIFT, with its MAP 44.69%. By Blob features and PCA as described in [17], we reached a higher MAP 45.35%.  X  Precision Using the same dataset and PCA method in [17], when STRIPE features take place of Blob features, the best MAP is 44.95%, which is 0.58% higher than GIFT, but 0.88% less than Blob.  X  Time working simultaneously. The worst PC has a 1.1G CPU and 128M RAM. However in the case of STRIPES, when using the  X  X orst X  PC (1.1G CPU + 128M RAM), the longest process costs 35 minutes with the parameter N s =8, N b =30. compared with Blob. In Fig.4 the comparison in MAP and PR-curve is shown. close to Blob. 3.2 ImageCLEF 2006: Medical Image Annotation Task 2 including 9000 images, as well as for testing set, including 1000 images. 
Our experiment is based on the training set and development set. The STRIPE features, Blob features, and DLSM features (16x16) are used separately. And we use SVM as the classifier. At last the correctness rates are 75.5%, 58.5%, and 75.1%. In Fig.5 the correctness for each class is shown. in online applications. With the comparison in two tasks from ImageCLEF, the mined, like more rotation angles for tilt stripes. And more features can be considered besides histogram.
