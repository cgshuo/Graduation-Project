 Collaboration is critical to the ma nagement of modern computer systems. At every scale, making computers work is a collective task, from enterprise systems where teams of disparate specialists work together to understand, mana ge, and maintain vast complex IT infrastructures, all the way dow n to individuals seeking online, family, and co-worker help on how to keep their personal computers running. Since 2007, the CHIMIT symposium has served as a venue for research on all aspects of HCI and the management of information t echnology. CHIMIT sits at the intersection of several research communities, and to better draw in people from these communities, we plan to hold a series of workshops emphasizing various aspects of HCI and IT management. For GROUP, we propose a one-day workshop examining the collaborative aspects of configuring, managing, and troubleshooting computer systems at all scales.

 Human Factors, Management. HCI, IT Management, CHIMIT. Computer systems exist to achieve human goals, such as communication, creativity, and info rmation retrieval. We define computer management as those tasks that divert us from our goals: configuration, installation, troubleshooting, etc. Enterprises must maintain large numbers of people whose entire job is management, and it seems that a ll of us spend more time than we X  X  like keeping our computers running. Collaboration is critical to the ma nagement of computer systems. This is true at every scale, whet her it is our parents asking us for help when  X  X he internet isn X  X  working, X  ourselves searching for  X  Processes and practices  X  examples of best practices and One possible workshop outcome is to write a paper describing the state of the art of collaboration tools and research for the domain of computer management. Partic ipants would frame this paper during the workshop, and complete it following GROUP for submission to a suitable venue (e .g., ACM Interactions), and/or publication on CHIMIT X  X  web site (http://chimit.acm.org). If sufficient novel and interesting work is submitted, it might be developed for eventual submissi on to an appropriate journal special issue or published under the auspices of CHIMIT. In order to foster maximum inter action, the number of participants will be limited to between 15 and 20 people. Participants will be selected based on refereed positi on papers. Those with a general interest in the area will be asked for up to 2 pages (regular CHI format) describing their backgr ound and potential contributions. Those with specific research c ontributions, either proposed or completed, may have up to 5 pa ges (regular CHI format). Our strategy for recruiting will include e-mail to all the usual mailing lists, as well as contacting pa st attendees of the CHIMIT symposium. This workshop will be one-day. The schedule will be dependent on the number and type of contributions, but will include time for the organizers to frame the problem space, participants to describe their positions, and everybody to discuss how to synthesize these positions into coherent work going forward. Audio/visual equipment should include a projector to help people share their ideas.

During her post doctoral research at The University of British Columbia, she worked on the HOT Admin project, which investigated the human, organizational, and technological aspects of IT security work. In addition, she has served on the program committee and as program chair and general chair (2011/2012) for ACM CHIMIT. Eben M. Haber is a research staff member at IBM X  X  Almaden Research Center. He spent much of the last decade studying enterprise IT administration, including undertaking field studies, developing prototype tools, and designing new features for middleware management products. He has filled organizational and program committee roles for ACM CHIMIT 2008-2011 (including general chair in 2009), and is a co-author on the forthcoming Oxford University Press book,  X  X aming Information Technology: Lessons from Studies of System Administrators.
