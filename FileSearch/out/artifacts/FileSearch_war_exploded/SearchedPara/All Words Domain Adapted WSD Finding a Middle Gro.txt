In spite of decades of research on word sense disambiguation (WSD), all-words general purpose WSD has remained a dis-tant goal. Many supervised WSD systems have been built, but the effort of creat-ing the training corpus -annotated sense marked corpora -has always been a matter of concern. Therefore, attempts have been made to develop unsupervised and knowl-edge based techniques for WSD which do not need sense marked corpora. However such approaches have not proved effective, since they typically do not better Word-net first sense baseline accuracy. Our re-search reported here proposes to stick to the supervised approach, but with far less demand on annotation. We show that if we have ANY sense marked corpora, be it from mixed domain or a specific domain, a small amount of annotation in ANY other domain can deliver the goods almost as if exhaustive sense marking were avail-able in that domain. We have tested our approach across Tourism and Health do-main corpora, using also the well known mixed domain SemCor corpus. Accuracy figures close to self domain training lend credence to the viability of our approach.

Our contribution thus lies in finding a con-venient middle ground between pure su-pervised and pure unsupervised WSD. Fi-nally, our approach is not restricted to any specific set of target words, a departure from a commonly observed practice in do-main specific WSD.
Amongst annotation tasks, sense marking surely takes the cake, demanding as it does high level of language competence, topic comprehension and domain sensitivity. This makes supervised ap-proaches to WSD a difficult proposition (Agirre et al., 2009b; Agirre et al., 2009a; McCarthy et al., 2007). Unsupervised and knowledge based ap-proaches have been tried with the hope of creating WSD systems with no need for sense marked cor-pora (Koeling et al., 2005; McCarthy et al., 2007; Agirre et al., 2009b). However, the accuracy fig-ures of such systems are low.

Our work here is motivated by the desire to de-velop annotation-lean all-words domain adapted techniques for supervised WSD. It is a common observation that domain specific WSD exhibits high level of accuracy even for the all-words sce-nario (Khapra et al., 2010) -provided training and testing are on the same domain. Also domain adaptation -in which training happens in one do-main and testing in another -often is able to attain good levels of performance, albeit on a specific set of target words (Chan and Ng, 2007; Agirre and de Lacalle, 2009). To the best of our knowledge there does not exist a system that solves the com-bined problem of all words domain adapted WSD . We thus propose the following: a. For any target domain, create a small amount b. Mix it with an existing sense annotated cor-This procedure tested on four adaptation scenar-ios, viz. , (i) SemCor (Miller et al., 1993) to Tourism, (ii) SemCor to Health, (iii) Tourism to Health and (iv) Health to Tourism has consistently yielded good performance (to be explained in sec-tions 6 and 7).

The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-lows. In section 2 we discuss previous work in the area of domain adaptation for WSD. In section 3 we discuss three state of art supervised, unsuper-vised and knowledge based algorithms for WSD.
Section 4 discusses the injection strategy for do-main adaptation. In section 5 we describe the dataset used for our experiments. We then present the results in section 6 followed by discussions in section 7. Section 8 examines whether there is any need for intelligent choice of injections. Section 9 concludes the paper highlighting possible future directions.
Domain specific WSD for selected target words has been attempted by Ng and Lee (1996), Agirre and de Lacalle (2009), Chan and Ng (2007), Koel-ing et al. (2005) and Agirre et al. (2009b). They report results on three publicly available lexical sample datasets, viz. , DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996), MEDLINE corpus (Weeber et al., 2001) and the corpus made available by Koeling et al. (2005). Each of these datasets contains a handful of target words (41-191 words) which are sense marked in the corpus.

Our main inspiration comes from the target-word specific results reported by Chan and Ng (2007) and Agirre and de Lacalle (2009). The former showed that adding just 30% of the target data to the source data achieved the same perfor-mance as that obtained by taking the entire source and target data. Agirre and de Lacalle (2009) re-ported a 22% error reduction when source and target data were combined for training a classi-fier, as compared to the case when only the target data was used for training the classifier. However, both these works focused on target word specific
WSD and do not address all-words domain spe-cific WSD.

In the unsupervised setting, McCarthy et al. (2007) showed that their predominant sense acqui-sition method gives good results on the corpus of
Koeling et al. (2005). In particular, they showed that the performance of their method is compa-rable to the most frequent sense obtained from a tagged corpus, thereby making a strong case for unsupervised methods for domain-specific WSD.
More recently, Agirre et al. (2009b) showed that knowledge based approaches which rely only on the semantic relations captured by the Wordnet graph outperform supervised approaches when ap-plied to specific domains. The good results ob-tained by McCarthy et al. (2007) and Agirre et al. (2009b) for unsupervised and knowledge based approaches respectively have cast a doubt on the viability of supervised approaches which rely on sense tagged corpora. However, these conclusions were drawn only from the performance on certain target words, leaving open the question of their utility in all words WSD.

We believe our work contributes to the WSD research in the following way: (i) it shows that there is promise in supervised approach to all-word WSD, through the instrument of domain adaptation; (ii) it places in perspective some very recently reported unsupervised and knowledge based techniques of WSD; (ii) it answers some questions arising out of the debate between super-vision and unsupervision in WSD; and finally (iv) it explores a convenient middle ground between unsupervised and supervised WSD  X  the territory of  X  X nnotate-little and inject X  paradigm. In this section we describe the knowledge based, unsupervised and supervised approaches used for our experiments. 3.1 Knowledge Based Approach Agirre et al. (2009b) showed that a graph based algorithm which uses only the relations between concepts in a Lexical Knowledge Base (LKB) can outperform supervised approaches when tested on specific domains (for a set of chosen target words). We employ their method which involves the fol-lowing steps: 1. Represent Wordnet as a graph where the con-2. Apply a context-dependent Personalized 3. These nodes corresponding to the context
We used the publicly available implementation 3.2 Unsupervised Approach
McCarthy et al. (2007) used an untagged corpus to construct a thesaurus of related words. They then found the predominant sense (i.e., the most fre-quent sense) of each target word using pair-wise
Wordnet based similarity measures by pairing the target word with its top -k neighbors in the the-saurus. Each target word is then disambiguated by assigning it its predominant sense  X  the moti-vation being that the predominant sense is a pow-erful, hard-to-beat baseline. We implemented their method using the following steps: 1. Obtain a domain-specific untagged corpus (we crawled a corpus of approximately 9M words from the web). 2. Extract grammatical relations from this text us-2003). 3. Use the grammatical relations thus extracted to construct features for identifying the k nearest neighbors for each word using the distributional similarity score described in (Lin, 1998). 4. Rank the senses of each target word in the test set using a weighted sum of the distributional similarity scores of the neighbors. The weights in the sum are based on Wordnet Similarity scores (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2003). 5. Each target word in the test set is then disam-biguated by simply assigning it its predominant sense obtained using the above method. 3.3 Supervised approach
Khapra et al. (2010) proposed a supervised algo-rithm for domain-specific WSD and showed that it beats the most frequent corpus sense and performs on par with other state of the art algorithms like
PageRank. We implemented their iterative algo-rithm which involves the following steps: 1. Tag all monosemous words in the sentence. 2. Iteratively disambiguate the remaining words in the sentence in increasing order of their degree of polysemy. 3. At each stage rank the candidate senses of a word using the scoring function of Equa-tion (1) which combines corpus based param-eters (such as, sense distributions and corpus co-occurrence) and Wordnet based parameters (such as, semantic similarity, conceptual dis-tance, etc. ) where,
W ij = CorpusCooccurrence ( S i , S j ) 4. Select the candidate synset with maximizes the above score as the winner sense. This section describes the main interest of our work i.e. adaptation using injections . For su-pervised adaptation, we use the supervised algo-rithm described above (Khapra et al., 2010) in the following 3 settings as proposed by Agirre et al. (2009a): a. Source setting: We train the algorithm on a mixed-domain corpus (SemCor) or a domain-specific corpus (say, Tourism) and test it on a different domain (say, Health). A good perfor-mance in this setting would indicate robustness to domain-shifts. b. Target setting: We train and test the algorithm using data from the same domain. This gives the skyline performance, i.e., the best performance that can be achieved if sense marked data from the target domain were available. c. Adaptation setting: This setting is the main fo-cus of interest in the paper. We augment the training data which could be from one domain or mixed domain with a small amount of data from the target domain. This combined data is then used for training. The aim here is to reach as close to the skyline performance using as lit-tle data as possible. For injecting data from the target domain we randomly select some sense marked words from the target domain and add them to the training data. An obvious ques-tion which arises at this point is  X  X hy were the words selected at random? X  or  X  X an selection of words using some active learning strategy yield better results than a random selection? X 
We discuss this question in detail in Section 7 and show that a random set of injections per-forms no worse than a craftily selected set of injections.
Due to the lack of any publicly available all-words domain specific sense marked corpora we set upon the task of collecting data from two domains, viz.,
Tourism and Health . The data for Tourism do-main was downloaded from Indian Tourism web-sites whereas the data for Health domain was ob-tained from two doctors. This data was manu-ally sense annotated by two lexicographers adept 1998) was used as the sense inventory. A total of 1,34,095 words from the Tourism domain and 42,046 words from the Health domain were man-ually sense marked. Some files were sense marked by both the lexicographers and the Inter Tagger
Agreement (ITA) calculated from these files was 83% which is comparable to the 78% ITA reported on the SemCor corpus considering the domain-specific nature of the corpus.

We now present different statistics about the corpora. Table 1 summarizes the number of poly-semous and monosemous words in each category. Note that we do not use the monosemous words while calculating precision and recall of our algo-rithms.

Table 2 shows the average number of instances per polysemous word in the 3 corpora. We note that the number of instances per word in the Tourism domain is comparable to that in the Sem-Cor corpus whereas the number of instances per word in the Health corpus is smaller due to the overall smaller size of the Health corpus.

Tables 3 and 4 summarize the average degree of Wordnet polysemy and corpus polysemy of the polysemous words in the corpus. Wordnet poly-semy is the number of senses of a word as listed in the Wordnet, whereas corpus polysemy is the number of senses of a word actually appearing in the corpus. As expected, the average degree of corpus polysemy (Table 4) is much less than the average degree of Wordnet polysemy (Table 3). Further, the average degree of corpus polysemy (Table 4) in the two domains is less than that in the mixed-domain SemCor corpus, which is expected due to the domain specific nature of the corpora. Finally, Table 5 summarizes the number of unique polysemous words per category in each domain.
The data is currently being enhanced by manu-ally sense marking more words from each domain poses.
We tested the 3 algorithms described in section 4 using SemCor, Tourism and Health domain cor-pora. We did a 2-fold cross validation for su-pervised adaptation and report the average perfor-mance over the two folds. Since the knowledge based and unsupervised methods do not need any training data we simply test it on the entire corpus from the two domains. 6.1 Knowledge Based approach The results obtained by applying the Personalized
PageRank (PPR) method to Tourism and Health data are summarized in Table 6. We also report the Wordnet first sense baseline (WFS).

Table 6: Comparing the performance of Person-alized PageRank (PPR) with Wordnet First Sense
Baseline (WFS) 6.2 Unsupervised approach
The predominant sense for each word in the two domains was calculated using the method de-scribed in section 4.2. McCarthy et al. (2004) reported that the best results were obtained us-ing k = 50 neighbors and the Wordnet Similar-ity jcn measure (Jiang and Conrath, 1997). Fol-lowing them, we used k = 50 and observed that the best results for nouns and verbs were obtained using the jcn measure and the best results for ad-jectives and adverbs were obtained using the lesk measure (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002). Accord-ingly, we used jcn for nouns and verbs and lesk for adjectives and adverbs. Each target word in the test set is then disambiguated by simply as-signing it its predominant sense obtained using the above method. We tested this approach only on Tourism domain due to unavailability of large untagged Health corpus which is needed for con-structing the thesaurus. The results are summa-rized in Table 7.

Table 7: Comparing the performance of unsuper-vised approach with Wordnet First Sense Baseline (WFS) 6.3 Supervised adaptation We report results in the source setting , target set-ting and adaptation setting as described earlier using the following four combinations for source and target data: 1. SemCor to Tourism (SC  X  T) where SemCor is used as the source domain and Tourism as the target (test) domain. 2. SemCor to Health (SC  X  H) where SemCor is used as the source domain and Health as the tar-get (test) domain. 3. Tourism to Health (T  X  H) where Tourism is used as the source domain and Health as the tar-get (test) domain. 4. Health to Tourism (H  X  T) where Health is used as the source domain and Tourism as the target (test) domain.

In each case, the target domain data was divided into two folds. One fold was set aside for testing and the other for injecting data in the adaptation setting . We increased the size of the injected target examples from 1000 to 14000 words in increments of 1000. We then repeated the same experiment by reversing the role of the two folds.

Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 show the graphs of the av-erage F-score over the 2-folds for SC  X  T, SC  X  H, T  X  H and H  X  T respectively. The x -axis repre-sents the amount of training data (in words) in-jected from the target domain and the y -axis rep-resents the F-score. The different curves in each graph are as follows: a. only random : This curve plots the perfor-mance obtained using x randomly selected sense tagged words from the target domain and zero sense tagged words from the source do-main ( x was varied from 1000 to 14000 words in increments of 1000). b. random+source : This curve plots the perfor-mance obtained by mixing x randomly selected sense tagged words from the target domain with the entire training data from the source domain (again x was varied from 1000 to 14000 words in increments of 1000). c. source baseline ( srcb ) : This represents the F-score obtained by training on the source data alone without mixing any examples from the target domain. d. wordnet first sense (wfs) : This represents the
F-score obtained by selecting the first sense from Wordnet, a typically reported baseline. e. target skyline (tsky) : This represents the av-erage 2-fold F-score obtained by training on one entire fold of the target data itself ( Health : 15320 polysemous words; Tourism : 47242 pol-ysemous words) and testing on the other fold.
These graphs along with other results are dis-cussed in the next section. We discuss the performance of the three ap-proaches. 7.1 Knowledge Based and Unsupervised It is apparent from Tables 6 and 7 that knowl-edge based and unsupervised approaches do not perform well when compared to the Wordnet first sense (which is freely available and hence can be used for disambiguation). Further, we observe that the performance of these approaches is even less than the source baseline ( i.e. , the case when train-ing data from a source domain is applied as it is to a target domain -without using any injections). These observations bring out the weaknesses of these approaches when used in an all-words set-ting and clearly indicate that they come nowhere close to replacing a supervised system. 7.2 Supervised adaptation 1. The F-score obtained by training on SemCor (mixed-domain corpus) and testing on the two target domains without using any injections ( srcb )  X  F-score of 61.7% on Tourism and F-score of 65.5% on Health  X  is comparable to the best result reported on the SEMEVAL datasets (65.02%, where both training and testing hap-pens on a mixed-domain corpus (Snyder and
Palmer, 2004)). This is in contrast to previ-ous studies (Escudero et al., 2000; Agirre and
Martinez, 2004) which suggest that instead of adapting from a generic/mixed domain to a spe-cific domain, it is better to completely ignore the generic examples and use hand-tagged data from the target domain itself. The main rea-son for the contrasting results is that the ear-lier work focused only on a handful of target words whereas we focus on all words appearing in the corpus. So, while the behavior of a few target words would change drastically when the domain changes, a majority of the words will exhibit the same behavior ( i.e., same predomi-nant sense) even when the domain changes. We agree that the overall performance is still lower than that obtained by training on the domain-specific corpora. However, it is still better than the performance of unsupervised and knowl-edge based approaches which tilts the scale in favor of supervised approaches even when only mixed domain sense marked corpora is avail-able. 2. Adding injections from the target domain im-proves the performance. As the amount of in-jection increases the performance approaches the skyline, and in the case of SC  X  H and T  X  H it even crosses the skyline performance showing that combining the source and target data can give better performance than using the target data alone. This is consistent with the domain adaptation results reported by Agirre and de La-calle (2009) on a specific set of target words. 3. The performance of random+source is always better than only random indicating that the data from the source domain does help to improve performance. A detailed analysis showed that the gain obtained by using the source data is at-tributable to reducing recall errors by increasing the coverage of seen words. 4. Adapting from one specific domain ( Tourism or Health ) to another specific domain ( Health or
Tourism ) gives the same performance as that ob-tained by adapting from a mixed-domain ( Sem-Cor ) to a specific domain ( Tourism, Health ).
This is an interesting observation as it suggests that as long as data from one domain is avail-able it is easy to build a WSD engine that works for other domains by injecting a small amount of data from these domains.
 To verify that the results are consistent, we ran-domly selected 5 different sets of injections from fold-1 and tested the performance on fold-2. We then repeated the same experiment by reversing the roles of the two folds. The results were in-deed consistent irrespective of the set of injections used. Due to lack of space we have not included the results for these 5 different sets of injections. 7.3 Quantifying the trade-off between To correctly quantify the benefit of adding injec-tions from the target domain, we calculated the amount of target data ( peak size ) that is needed to reach the skyline F-score ( peak F ) in the ab-sence of any data from the source domain. The peak size was found to be 35000 (Tourism) and 14000 (Health) corresponding to peak F values of 74.2% (Tourism) and 73.4% (Health). We then plotted a graph (Figure 5) to capture the rela-tion between the size of injections (expressed as a percentage of the peak size ) and the F-score (ex-pressed as a percentage of the peak F ).
We observe that by mixing only 20-40% of the peak size with the source domain we can obtain up to 95% of the performance obtained by using the entire target data ( peak size ). In absolute terms, the size of the injections is only 7000-9000 poly-semous words which is a very small price to pay considering the performance benefits.
An obvious question which arises at this point is  X  X hy were the words selected at random? X  or  X  X an selection of words using some active learn-ing strategy yield better results than a random selection? X  An answer to this question requires a more thorough understanding of the sense-behavior exhibited by words across domains. In any scenario involving a shift from domain D domain D longing to the following 4 categories: a.
 W countered only in the source domain D not appear in the target domain D are interested in adapting to the target domain and since these words do not appear in the tar-get domain, it is quite obvious that they are not important for the problem of domain adapta-tion. b.
 W countered only in the target domain D not appear in the source domain D is quite obvious that these words are important for the problem of domain adaptation. They fall in the category of unseen words and need han-dling from that point of view. c.
 W which are encountered in both the domains and exhibit the same predominant sense in both the domains. Correct identification of these words is important so that we can use the predomi-nant sense learned from D instances of these words appearing in D d.
 W words which are encountered in both the do-mains but their predominant sense in the tar-get domain D dominant sense learned from the source domain
D portant so that we can ignore the predominant senses learned from D instances of these words appearing in D Table 8 summarizes the percentage of words that fall in each category in each of the three adapta-tion scenarios. The fact that nearly 50-60% of the words fall in the  X  X onformist X  category once again makes a strong case for reusing sense tagged data from one domain to another domain.
 Category SC  X  T SC  X  H T  X  H Conformists 49.54% 60.43% 54.31% Non-Conformists 43.30% 34.11% 32.06%
Table 8: Percentage of Words belonging to each category in the three settings.
 The above characterization suggests that an ideal domain adaptation strategy should focus on in-jecting W would yield maximum benefits if injected into the training data. While it is easy to identify the W hard problem which itself requires some type of WSD 5 . However, just to prove that a random in-jection strategy does as good as an ideal strategy we assume the presence of an oracle which iden-tifies the W the training data with 5-8 instances for W W observed that adding more than 5-8 instances per word does not improve the performance. This is due to the  X  X ne sense per domain X  phenomenon  X  seeing only a few instances of a word is sufficient to identify the predominant sense of the word. Fur-ther, to ensure a better overall performance, the instances of the most frequent words are injected first followed by less frequent words till we ex-haust the total size of the injections (1000, 2000 and so on). We observed that there was a 75-80% overlap between the words selected by ran-dom strategy and oracle strategy. This is because oracle selects the most frequent words which also have a high chance of getting selected when a ran-dom sampling is done.

Figures 6, 7, 8 and 9 compare the performance of the two strategies. We see that the random strat-egy does as well as the oracle strategy thereby sup-porting our claim that if we have sense marked corpus from one domain then simply injecting ANY small amount of data from the target domain will do the job.
Based on our study of WSD in 4 domain adap-tation scenarios, we make the following conclu-sions: 1. Supervised adaptation by mixing small amount of data (7000-9000 words) from the target do-main with the source domain gives nearly the same performance (F-score of around 70% in all the 4 adaptation scenarios) as that obtained by training on the entire target domain data. 2. Unsupervised and knowledge based approaches which use distributional similarity and Word-net based similarity measures do not compare well with the Wordnet first sense baseline per-formance and do not come anywhere close to the performance of supervised adaptation. 3. Supervised adaptation from a mixed domain to a specific domain gives the same performance as that from one specific domain (Tourism) to another specific domain (Health). 4. Supervised adaptation is not sensitive to the type of data being injected. This is an interest-ing finding with the following implication: as long as one has sense marked corpus -be it from a mixed or specific domain -simply injecting
ANY small amount of data from the target do-main suffices to beget good accuracy.
 As future work, we would like to test our work on the Environment domain data which was released as part of the SEMEVAL 2010 shared task on  X  X ll-words Word Sense Disambiguation on a Specific Domain X .
