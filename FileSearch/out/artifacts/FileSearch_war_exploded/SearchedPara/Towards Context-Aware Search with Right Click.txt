 Many queries are submitted to search engines by right-clicking the marked text ( i.e., the query) in Web browsers. Because the docu-ment being read by the searcher often provides su ffi cient contextual information for the query, search engine could provide much more relevant search results if the query is augmented by the contextual information captured from the source document. How to extract the right contextual information from the source document is the main focus of this study. To this end, we evaluate 7 text component extraction schemes, and 5 feature extraction schemes. The former determines from which text component ( e.g., title, meta-data, or paragraphs containing the selected query) to extract contextual in-formation; the latter determines which words or phrases to extract. In total 35 combinations are evaluated and our evaluation results show that noun phrases extracted from all paragraphs that contain the query word is the best option.
 H.3.3 [ INFORMATION STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL ]: Infor-mation Search and Retrieval X  Query formulation Right-click query, Context-aware search, Query expansion
Search for information online through general or dedicated search engines becomes a part of our daily life. To perform a search, a keyword query is often submitted to a search engine and the lat-ter returns the documents most relevant to the query. A keyword query can be submitted to a search engine through many applica-tions communicating with the search engine. Web browser is one of such applications. Figure 1 captures the pop-up menus of three popular Web browsers ( i.e., Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Fire-fox) when a user right-clicks some selected words in a Web page ( e.g., "Tau Ceti" in the figure). The selected words will then be sub-mitted to search engine as a keyword query. Because of the way a query is submitted to a search engine, we refer a query submitted Figure 1: Right click to search in three popular Web browsers by right-clicking some selected words in Web browser right-click query . Figure 1 also shows that some native or third-party exten-sions (also known as add-ons or accelerators) that have been de-veloped facilitating user X  X  query submission to her preferred search engine. With this background, we motivate this study with two ob-servations.  X  First, right-click queries are currently processed in the same  X  Second, for many queries, particularly those short queries that Based on the two observations, we argue that the contextual infor-mation available in the source document of a right-click query is not utilized by existing search engines. On the other hand, such contextual information can be extracted with limited e ff ort to en-able Context-Aware Search for better user search experiences. The notion of context can be defined in many di ff erent ways in Information Retrieval research. In a recent survey on contextual search, Melucci gives two di ff erent extremes of the definition: (i) "the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed", and (ii) "the parts of something written or spoken that immedi-ately precede and follow a word or passage and clarify its mean-ing" [6]. Our definition of "context", hence the notion of context-aware search , is close to the second extreme. That is, in our defini-tion of context-aware search , we do not consider any other factors of a user beyond the current document a user is reading, i.e., the source document.

In this paper, we enumerate and compare di ff erent approaches to extract contextual information from the source document for a right-click query. We try to answer two main questions: (i) Given the source document of a right-click query, which component of the document ( e.g., title, full text, paragraph containing the right-click query) is best in providing contextual information for the query? and (ii) What contextual information ( e.g., words, nouns, or noun phrases) shall be extracted to augment the query? To answer the first question, we evaluate 7 text extraction schemes to determine the text component from which to extract the contextual informa-tion of a right-click query. To answer the second question, we eval-uate 5 feature extraction schemes to extract and rank words, nouns, and noun phrases using di ff erent weighting schemes. In our ex-periments, we report the evaluation of 35 context extraction com-binations on a collection containing 20 news articles from Yahoo! news. 2 Our evaluation shows that noun phrases extracted from the paragraphs containing the query word of a right-click query provide the best contextual information.

We argue that the extracted contextual information ( e.g., in the form of noun phrases with weights) can be easily incorporated into a right-click query for more relevant search results. Figure 2 illus-trates a general framework to incorporate the query context. After user marks text ( i.e., query) in browser, she explicitly selects the contextual phrases and the search engine through right-click con-text menu, similar to the menus captured in Figure 1. The selec-tion may also be made implicit if the top-ranked noun phrase is always picked up as context. The query and the selected contextual phrase(s) are then posted to the search engine. Nevertheless, the detailed implementation on utilizing the contextual information is out of the scope of this study.
In this section, we first discuss the di ff erences and similarities between our contextual search and search personalization. We then survey the works on contextual advertising. Lastly, we distinguish our work from other studies on context-aware search.
 Search Personalization . Contextual search is heavily researched in literature and is mainly studied from personalization perspec-tive. A large portion of a recent comprehensive survey on contex-tual search is devoted to the study of personal interest from inter-action, content, social, and geographical variables [6]. As clarified in our earlier discussion, we do not consider user search behavior and click / browsing history. Instead, we only consider the contex-tual information from the source document of a right-click query. In this setting, user profiling techniques ( e.g., by extracting key-words from browsing history) are relevant to our research. Matthijs and Radlinski learn users X  long-term interests by summarizing the content of the Web pages in their browsing history. Six di ff erent summaries are evaluated in their study by extracting unigrams from full text, title, metadata description, metadata keywords, by extract-ing noun phrase, and by extracting important keywords (including unigrams and phrases) using linguistic and statistical information. Their study shows that all these summaries are helpful in improv-ing personalization except unigrams from full text. Other than the content of the Web pages, users may also be profiled by their pro-vided social tags to the Web pages [7]. However, in our setting, we do not assume that user provides tags for the Web page she is currently reading.
 Contextual Advertising . Contextual advertising is to display ad-vertisement best matching the estimated interests of users. In many settings, the user interests are estimated from the content displayed to user. To minimize latency and communication costs, summariz-ing the content of the Web page is often done prior to performing a match search on the advertisements. In [1], the role of page com-ponents in crafting short but informative page fragment that serve as an alternative description of the entire page is studied. Their experiments show that the combination consisting of page URL, referrer URL, title, meta-data, and headings serves as a good page summary. It uses only 6% of the page text and achieves 97% -99% of the full-text-based relevance. In [2], Giuliano Armano et al. summarize Web page by retrieving relevant blocks of a Web page. They propose and evaluate five summarization techniques, namely Title and First Paragraph (TFP), Title and First Two Paragraphs (TF2P), Title, First and Last Paragraphs (TFLP), Most Titled-words and Keywords (MTK), and N most Frequent Keywords (NK). On the BankSearch Dataset consisting of 11,000 Web pages in 11 dif-ferent categories as the evaluation data set, TFLP provides the best performance in terms of accuracy.
 Context-Aware Search . The IntelliZap system reported in [4] en-ables a user to search the marked text in a document she views as query. The context of the query ( i.e., the marked text in the doc-ument) is derived from the surrounding text. Semantic keywords are then extracted from the context using a clustering-based ap-proach which are then used to generate augmented queries. While the context is relatively fixed to be the about 50 words surround-ing the marked query in [4], we evaluate di ff erent approaches of extracting context for a marked query in this paper. This also dis-tinguish our study from [5] where di ff erent search strategies ( e.g., query rewriting, rank biasing, and iterative filtering meta-search) have been evaluated with explicitly provided query context. Our proposed context-aware search is categorized into the query rewrit-ing strategy. Specifically, query rewriting augments a query using additional words derived from its context, hence can be readily sup-ported by all search engines without any modification to the search engines. It is reported in [4] that  X  X uery rewriting performs surpris-ingly well X . Note that, query rewriting is also considered as a form of query expansion [3].
Given a document d , from which a text string at position p is marked by a user as a right-click query q for search, our task is to identify a few words or phrases from d to serve as the context of q such that the search results matches q with respect to d . Note that, the same text string q may appear multiple times at di ff erent positions in the document.

We solve the problem by considering two perspectives: (i) from which text component of the document to extract contextual infor-mation; and (ii) which words or phrases to be extracted as contex-Table 1: The 7 text components T1  X  T7 for context extraction tual information to augment the query. For the former, based on the works surveyed in Section 2, we evaluate 7 text components for extracting context from title, full text, paragraphs containing the query, and others, shown in Table 1. For the latter, we evaluate 5 feature extraction options to extract the context word or phrases, shown in Table 2. Nouns and noun phrases are detected using o ff -the-shelf POS (part-of-speech) tagger. The words or nouns are ranked by 2 weighting schemes, namely, Frequency-based weight-ing , Proximity-based weighting . The noun phrases are weighted by Phrase weighting . We detail the three weighting schemes.  X  Frequency-based weighting of a term t i , which can be a noun  X  Proximity-based weighting scheme factors in the distance be- X  Let s be a phrase and t i  X  s be a term contained in s . Phrase Table 3: Precision of the 35 combinations. The best result for each text component extraction scheme (T1 -T7) is in boldface, for each feature extraction scheme (F1 -F5) underlined. Dataset and Evaluation Setting . To evaluate the performance of di ff erent context extraction and weighting schemes, we conducted a user study using 20 news articles from Yahoo! News (see Ta-ble 4 for example articles and queries). These articles / queries in the dataset are selected mainly based on two criteria: (i) article contains an ambiguous query term; (ii) two or more articles con-tain the same query term but with di ff erent semantics. The IDF of terms are estimated using Reuters-21578 collection.

From each news article, we first mark the right-click query and then evaluate the top-8 words ranked by each combination of text component / feature extraction schemes (Tables 1 and 2). The top-8 words are selected for evaluation so as to easily compare with Google as the baseline method. Google usually recommends 8 related queries for a given query and these 8 queries are recom-mended without considering the context as defined in our setting. Note that in our experiments, only one-word queries are evalu-ated because they are usually vague and ambiguous as compared to multi-word queries. A multi-word query is usually more topic specific making the context less important in search.

Each of the top-8 ranked words is manually judged to be rele-vant or irrelevant based on the content of the news article and the marked query ( i.e., whether the word is helpful in providing con-textual information to the query with respect to the article). Exam-ple relevant words for query  X  X ub X  in the article titled  X  X ameron left 8-year-old daughter in pub X  include drinks , friends , and mix . However flood management is an example of relevant phrase for the same query in the article titled  X  X UB to spend S$750 million to improve drainage X  where PUB stands for Public Utilities Board, Singapore X  X  National Water Agency.

Because each method is expected to return a fixed number ( i.e., top-8) of keywords, we adopt precision to be our evaluation met-ric, which is the ratio of the relevant words. If any scheme returns fewer than 8 words, then precision is computed based on all re-turned words. For a fair comparison, the top-N phrases are selected such that P s  X  t o p  X  N | s |  X  8, i.e., the total number of words in the selected phrases is not larger than 8. In our experiments, we used the Stanford POS Tagger 3 for extracting nouns and noun phrases. The noun phrases are extracted by regular expression: (Adjective | Noun)* (Noun Preposition)? (Adjective | Noun)* Noun .
 Evaluation Results . The precisions of the 35 combinations (T1-T7 with F1-F5) are plotted in Figure 3. For easy comparison, the preci-Figure 3: Precision of the 35 combinations against the baseline (the horizontal line in the plot). sion of the baseline method which is 0.194 is plotted in a horizontal line in the figure. The precision values are also reported in Table 3, with the averaged value over T1-T7 and F1-F5 respectively. From the results, we make the following four observations.

To summarize, noun phrases extracted from the paragraphs con-taining the query word provide better contextual information for right-click query. Other than noun phrases, nouns provide better context than any words and proximity-based weighting schemes adversely a ff ect the quality of context.

In this paper, we focus on right-click query that is submitted to a search engine by marking a text string in a Web page. To extract the contextual information for the right-click query, we evaluate 35 combinations involving 7 text component extraction schemes and 5 feature extraction schemes. Our evaluation shows that paragraphs containing the marked query are the best text component for con-textual information extraction. Noun phrases is the best option to extract query context followed by nouns and then any words. How-ever, our experiment also shows that proximity-based weighting scheme adversely a ff ects context extraction. We argue that contex-tual information can be relatively easily integrated into right-click queries through Web browsers. The integration can be supported natively by the browser or through third-party extensions.
Our evaluation results are based on the relevance judgement of the extracted contextual information with respect to the query and the source document, and not the actual search results from any search engines because of two reasons. First, search results heavily depend on the underline search engines used in evaluation. Sec-ond, contextual information augmenting a query only provides a description of the query. Therefore a search result may not neces-sarily contain these contextual keywords to be a good match. In other words, the search query and the contextual information are not equally important in the search, which is not naturally sup-ported by general search engines through Web interface. It is there-fore interesting to study the impact of possible query augmentation schemes for best search results, which is part of our future work. [1] A. Anagnostopoulos, A. Z. Broder, E.
