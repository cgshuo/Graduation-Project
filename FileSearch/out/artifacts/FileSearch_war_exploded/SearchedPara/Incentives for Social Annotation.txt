 The effectiveness of community-driven annotation, such as social bookmarking, depends on user participation. Since the participa-tion of many users is motivated by selfish reasons, an effective way to encourage participation is to create useful or entertaining ap-plications. We demo two such tools  X  a browser extension and a game.

Social bookmarking allows Web users to actively annotate indi-vidual Web resources. Researchers are exploring the use of these annotations to create implicit links between online resources. We explore the use of these implicit relationships in the context of GiveALink.org , a social-bookmarking system developed for research purposes [1].

GiveALink relies on bookmark donations. Its effectiveness de-pends on the critical density of these annotations, and thus on user participation. An effective way to encourage users is to incentivize participation through applications that provide added value or that entertain. We have developed one of each  X  a browser extension providing tools for bookmark management and web navigation, and a game to generate annotations [2].
We have developed a browser extension for Firefox 3 providing a set of GiveALink tools to users (Fig 1(a)). Bookmark manage-ment tools aid users in maintaining their own bookmarks, which in turn provides GiveALink with more data for supporting applica-tions such as search, recommendation, and navigation.

Bookmark Management: A link manager provides users with a single interface for maintaining their bookmarks. They can man-age online bookmarks in the browser, using an interface that allows
Figure 1: Two applications to encourage tagging of online resources tagging, searching, and moving through their bookmarks, and vi-sualizes the networks of relationships between and among tags and resources. The manager will increase the amount of annotation by making it convenient to organize resources. In turn, this data can enhance user experience by improving GiveALink X  X  performance.
Web Navigation: Currently, browsers do not visualize a page X  X  semantic context beyond its content. Visualizations of the relation-ships provide a semantic map, allowing the user to see where the current page is in terms of related tags and pages. Users can use the map as an alternative way to understand the content and con-text of the page, as well as an alternative way to navigate the web, by visiting or exploring related pages and tags.
As an incentive for users to annotate resources, we are designing an online game (Fig 1(b)). Users tag pages to find a path from a given starting resource to a given target resource. The game will entertain users while simultaneously addressing an important prob-lem, namely the sparseness of the semantic networks. As users tag resources in the game to find a path from one resource to an-other, GiveALink stores the tagging metadata. When tags have been confirmed by enough participants in the game, this informa-tion is added to the database for calculating the relationships among tags and resources.
