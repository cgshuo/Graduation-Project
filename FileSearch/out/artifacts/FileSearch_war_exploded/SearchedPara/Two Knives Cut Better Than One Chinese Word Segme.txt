 Chinese text is written without delimiters between words; as a result, Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is an essential foundational step for many tasks in Chinese natural language processing. As demonstrated by (Shi and Wang, 2007; Bai et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2008; Kummerfeld et al., 2013), the quality and consistency of segmentation has important downstream impacts on system per-formance in machine translation, POS tagging and parsing.

State-of-the-art performance in CWS is high, with F-scores in the upper 90s. Still, challenges remain. Unknown words, also known as out-of-vocabulary ( OOV ) words, lead to difficulties for word-or dictionary-based approaches. Ambiguity can cause errors when the appropriate segmenta-tion is determined contextually, such as  X   X  ( X  X al-ent X ) and  X  /  X  ( X  X ust able X ) (Gao et al., 2003).
There are two primary classes of models: character-based, where the foundational units for processing are individual Chinese characters (Xue, 2003; Tseng et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2010), and word-based, where the units are full words based on some dictionary or training lexicon (Andrew, 2006; Zhang and Clark, 2007). Sun (2010) details their respective theo-retical strengths: character-based approaches bet-ter model the internal compositional structure of words and are therefore more effective at inducing new OOV words; word-based approaches are bet-ter at reproducing the words of the training lexi-con and can capture information from significantly larger contextual spans. Prior work has shown per-formance gains from combining these two types of models to exploit their respective strengths, but such approaches are often complex to implement and computationally expensive.

In this work, we propose a simple and prin-cipled joint decoding method for combining character-based and word-based segmenters based on dual decomposition. This method has strong optimality guarantees and works very well empir-ically. It is easy to implement and does not re-quire retraining of existing character-and word-based segmenters. Perhaps most importantly, this work presents a much more practical and usable form of classifier combination in the CWS context than existing methods offer.

Experimental results on standard SIGHAN 2003 and 2005 bake-off evaluations show that our model outperforms the character and word base-lines by a significant margin. In particular, out approach improves OOV recall rates and segmen-tation consistency, and gives the best reported re-sults to date on 6 out of 7 datasets. Here we describe the character-based and word-based models we use as baselines, review existing approaches to combination, and describe our algo-rithm for joint decoding with dual decomposition. 2.1 Character-based Models In the most commonly used contemporary ap-proach to character-based segmentation, first pro-posed by (Xue, 2003), CWS is seen as a charac-ter sequence tagging task, where each character is tagged on whether it is at the beginning, mid-dle, or end of a word. Conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) have been widely adopted for this task, and give state-of-the-art re-sults (Tseng et al., 2005). In a first-order linear-chain CRF model, the conditional probability of a label sequence y given a word sequence x is de-fined as: f ( x,y t ,y t  X  1 ) are feature functions that typically include surrounding character n-gram and mor-phological suffix/prefix features. These types of features capture the compositional properties of characters and are likely to generalize well to un-known words. However, the Markov assumption in CRF limits the context of such features; it is difficult to capture long-range word features in this model. 2.2 Word-based Models Word-based models search through lists of word candidates using scoring functions that directly assign scores to each. Early word-based seg-mentation work employed simple heuristics like dictionary-lookup maximum matching (Chen and Liu, 1992). More recently, Zhang and Clark (2007) reported success using a linear model trained with the average perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002). Formally, given input x , their model seeks a segmentation y such that: F ( y | x ) is the score of segmentation result y . Searching through the entire GEN( x ) space is intractable even with a local model, so a beam-search algorithm is used. The search algorithm consumes one character input token at a time, and iterates through the existing beams to score two new alternative hypotheses by either appending the new character to the last word in the beam, or starting a new word at the current position. Algorithm 1 Dual decomposition inference algo-rithm, and modified Viterbi and beam-search algo-rithms. 2.3 Combining Models with Dual Various mixing approaches have been proposed to combine the above two approaches (Wang et al., 2006; Lin, 2009; Sun et al., 2009; Sun, 2010; Wang et al., 2010). These mixing models perform well on standard datasets, but are not in wide use because of their high computational costs and dif-ficulty of implementation.

Dual decomposition (DD) (Rush et al., 2010) offers an attractive framework for combining these two types of models without incurring high costs in model complexity (in contrast to (Sun et al., 2009)) or decoding efficiency (in contrast to bag-ging in (Wang et al., 2006; Sun, 2010)). DD has been successfully applied to similar situations for combining local with global models; for example, in dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2010), bilingual sequence tagging (Wang et al., 2013) and word alignment (DeNero and Macherey, 2011).

The idea is that jointly modelling both character-sequence and word information can be computationally challenging, so instead we can try to find outputs that the two models are most likely Table 1: Results on SIGHAN 2005 datasets. R oov denotes OOV recall, and C denotes segmentation consistency. Best number in each column is highlighted in bold. to agree on. Formally, the objective of DD is: is the output of word-based perceptron, and the agreements are expressed as constraints. s.t. is a shorthand for  X  X uch that X .

Solving this constrained optimization problem directly is difficult. Instead, we take the La-grangian relaxation of this term as: where U is the set of Lagrangian multipliers that consists of a multiplier u i at each word position i . We can rewrite the original objective with the Lagrangian relaxation as:
We can then form the dual of this problem by taking the min outside of the max , which is an up-per bound on the original problem. The dual form can then be decomposed into two sub-components (the two max problems in Eq. 4), each of which is local with respect to the set of Lagrangian multi-pliers: This method is called dual decomposition (DD) (Rush et al., 2010). Similar to previous work (Rush and Collins, 2012), we solve this DD prob-lem by iteratively updating the sub-gradient as de-best segmentations provided by the two models do not agree, then the two models will receive penal-ties for the decisions they made that differ from the other. This penalty exchange is similar to message passing, and as the penalty accumulates over itera-tions, the two models are pushed towards agreeing with each other. We also give an updated Viterbi decoding algorithm for CRF and a modified beam-search algorithm for perceptron in Algorithm 1. T is the maximum number of iterations before early stopping, and  X  t is the learning rate at time t . We adopt a learning rate update rule from Koo et al. (2010) where  X  t is defined as 1 number of times we observed a consecutive dual value increase from iteration 1 to t . We conduct experiments on the SIGHAN 2003 (Sproat and Emerson, 2003) and 2005 (Emer-son, 2005) bake-off datasets to evaluate the ef-fectiveness of the proposed dual decomposition algorithm. We use the publicly available Stan-character-based baseline model, and reproduce the perceptron-based segmenter from Zhang and Clark (2007) as our word-based baseline model.
We adopted the development setting from (Zhang and Clark, 2007), and used CTB sections 1-270 for training and sections 400-931 for devel-opment in hyper-parameter setting; for all results given in tables, the models are trained and eval-uated on the standard train/test split for the given dataset. The optimized hyper-parameters used are: ` 2 regularization parameter  X  in CRF is set to 3 ; the perceptron is trained for 10 iterations with beam size 200; dual decomposition is run to max iteration of 100 ( T in Algo. 1) with step size 0.1 (  X  t in Algo. 1).
 Beyond standard precision (P), recall (R) and F 1 scores, we also evaluate segmentation consis-tency as proposed by (Chang et al., 2008), who have shown that increased segmentation consis-tency is correlated with better machine transla-tion performance. The consistency measure cal-culates the entropy of segmentation variations  X  the lower the score the better. We also report out-of-vocabulary recall (R oov ) as an estimation of the model X  X  generalizability to previously unseen words. Table 1 shows our empirical results on SIGHAN 2005 dataset. Our dual decomposition method outperforms both the word-based and character-based baselines consistently across all four sub-sets in both F 1 and OOV recall (R oov ). Our method demonstrates a robustness across domains and segmentation standards regardless of which baseline model was stronger. Of particular note is DD X  X  is much more robust in R oov , where the two baselines swing a lot. This is an important property for downstream applications such as en-tity recognition. The DD algorithm is also more consistent, which would likely lead to improve-ments in applications such as machine translation (Chang et al., 2008).

The improvement over our word-and character-based baselines is also seen in our results on the earlier SIGHAN 2003 dataset. Table 2 puts our method in the context of earlier systems for CWS. Our method achieves the best reported score on 6 out of 7 datasets. On the whole, dual decomposition produces state-of-the-art segmentations that are more accurate, more consistent, and more successful at induc-ing OOV words than the baseline systems that it combines. On the SIGHAN 2005 test set, in over 99.1% of cases the DD algorithm converged within 100 iterations, which gives an optimality guarantee. In 77.4% of the cases, DD converged in the first iteration. The number of iterations to convergence histogram is plotted in Figure 1. Table 2: Performance of dual decomposition in comparison to past published results on SIGHAN 2003 and 2005 datasets. Best reported F 1 score for each dataset is highlighted in bold. Z&amp;C 07 refers to Zhang and Clark (2007). Best 03, 05 are results of the winning systems for each dataset in the respective shared tasks.
 Error analysis In many cases the relative con-fidence of each model means that dual decom-position is capable of using information from both sources to generate a series of correct segmentations better than either baseline model alone. The example below shows a difficult-to-segment proper name comprised of common char-acters, which results in undersegmentation by the character-based CRF and oversegmentation by the word-based perceptron, but our method achieves the correct middle ground.

A powerful feature of the dual decomposition approach is that it can generate correct segmenta-tion decisions in cases where a voting or product-of-experts model could not, since joint decod-ing allows the sharing of information at decod-ing time. In the following example, both baseline models miss the contextually clear use of the word  X   X  ( X  X weets / snack food X ) and instead attach  X  to the prior word to produce the otherwise com-mon compound  X   X  X  X  ( X  X  little bit X ); dual de-composition allows the model to generate the cor-rect segmentation.

We found more than 400 such surprisingly ac-curate instances in our dual decomposition output.
Finally, since dual decomposition is a method of joint decoding, it is still liable to reproduce errors made by the constituent systems. In this paper we presented an approach to Chinese word segmentation using dual decomposition for system combination. We demonstrated that this method allows for joint decoding of existing CWS systems that is more accurate and consistent than either system alone, and further achieves the best performance reported to date on standard datasets for the task. Perhaps most importantly, our ap-proach is straightforward to implement and does not require retraining of the underlying segmenta-tion models used. This suggests its potential for broader applicability in real-world settings than existing approaches to combining character-based and word-based models for Chinese word segmen-tation.
