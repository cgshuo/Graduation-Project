 Web 2.0 has provided organizati ons remarkable opportunities to improve productivity, gain competitive advantage, and increase participation by engaging a crowd to accomplish tasks at scale. However, establishing and integrating crowd-based systems into organizations is still an open question. The systems and the collaborative processes they enable appear diametrically in dissonance with the norms and culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing in traditional organizations. They require mechanisms for articulation of work, coordination, cooperation, and knowledge co-creation that ar e fundamentally different from those in current groupwork syst ems and processes. Building on two workshops hosted at ACM CSCW 2014, we will explore questions such as: How does the shift in organizational work from a closed system with known indi viduals, to an open and crowd model that requires engagement with an undefined network of people, affect how we conceptualize groupwork? What are the implications for the design of groupwork systems? What can the crowdsourcing research community learn from groupwork systems, or conversely what can groupwork researchers learn from crowdsourcing? How do cultures, motivations, ownership and representation fit into these systems? This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in crowdsourcing, social computing, collaborative technologies, organizational science, and workplace research, to discuss the future of groupwork systems in the era of crowdwork with the goal of articulating an agenda for future research. H.5.m. Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI): Miscellaneous. Human Factors, Design Groupwork, Crowdsourcing, Social Computing, Organizations. Five years ago discussions of computer support for groupwork in organizational contexts were c onfined to collaborations among known individuals who are members of a set of organizations by virtue of being employed by thos e organizations, but this situation has changed. Organizational wo rk has morphed from a closed system to utilizing open and crowd models, where collaboration and knowledge co-creation with an undefined network of people are essential characteristics. Despite the remarkable promises of this new work model, the development of effective struct ures for collaborating between organizations and a crowd, and establishing crowdwork as an organizational process, remain s a huge challenge. Because of their relationship with non-paid systems like Wikipedia, most forms of organizational crowdwork often emulate non-paid crowdsourcing models where motivation for effective participation evolves from a comm on interest or sense of civic duty. The incentive to particip ate often arises from gaining reputation and recognition among other users, but the complex challenges with managing articula tion and coordination of work often do not surface so challengingly. People with similar interests, or who face similar problems, are simply attracted to each other sharing similar perspectives, codes, and rituals  X  leading to effective collaboration and work coordination, but also to exclusion and conformity. Co mmon ethos becomes a sufficient guideline and incentive to participate [9]. The merging of these approaches with more traditional organizations provides opportunitie s and raises tensions. What happens when these economic systems are combined with more formal organizational hierarchie s? While a number of challenging issues have been identified [6][8] and many existing tools and services have enabled organi zations to employ the crowd workforce, there are currently no coherent frameworks to inform the design of collaborative solutions for crowdwork, and guide the establishment of crowdwork as an organizational business process. For example, existing notions of crowdwork convey very little about areas that are seen essential in groupwork systems, such as the articulation of wo rk, coordination of engagements between organizations and a cr owd, or how resources are managed to get work done [9]. Complex tensions between the motivation of individuals, and of organizations, require the consideration of new hybrid organizational models that combine open and closed systems [1] [5]. This workshop aims to explore what contributions groupwork research can potentially make to solving the myriad challenges in organizational crowdwork research, and conversely, to disc uss the potentials of the trends and challenges in organizational crowdwork in paving a way for the emergence of the next generation of groupwork systems. The goal of this interdisciplin ary workshop is to explore the future of groupwork systems in the era of crowdwork. This proposal is the result of bringing together organizers and attendees from two separate wo rkshops entitled "Back to the Future of Organizational Work: Crowdsourcing and Digital Work Marketplaces" [4] and "Structures for Knowledge Co-creation between Organizations and the P ublic" [2] held at ACM CSCW 2014. The workshops raised an overlapping set of issues and potentials for research in the areas of threats and opportunities posed by organizational crowdwork, structures for engagement and knowledge co-creation in emerging models of open and crowd work, and the need to approach organizational crowdwork not only as a technical challenge, but also a profoundly human, social, organizational and philosophical issue. This workshop aims to bridge the successes of the two workshops and extend their results by investigating th e design of systems and processes to support organizations in this new area of open and crowd work. A key contribution is to build on the themes found in the prior workshops by producing deeper discussions and integration of different perspectives. Given the focus on designing computer support for group work based on a multi-disciplinary approach to understanding the specifics of both social engage ments and techni cal requirements of collaborative tools, GROUP has a crucial role to play in guiding thoughts around the formulation of guiding principles for the design of effective organizational crowdwork systems. The workshop will explore how studies of CSCW, HCI and CSCL, as well as their concepts and sensibilities, can be extended and applied toward the design of sustainable frameworks and collaboration systems for organiza tional crowdwork. Questions of interest to the workshop include:  X  What is the future of groupwork systems in the era of  X  How can groupwork research contribute to crowdwork  X  How can collaboration  X  X n the crowd X  be motivated and  X  What are the underlying ideologies and principles in the  X  What functions should the next generation of groupwork This workshop is organized ar ound three key themes that will drive the call for position papers, and help to structure activities during the workshop. The workshop will also include space for inspiration sourced from the position papers and interests of the participants. The issues that we consider critical, as emerged in the two CSCW 2014 workshops [2], [4] are: (1) the design of socio-technical systems; (2) th e emergence of hybrid-economic systems; and (3) the lack of equal representation. These overarching themes are deemed crucial to rethink groupwork within crowdsourcing processes. Design of Socio-technical Systems The problems of organizational crowdwork are not just technical problems, but profoundly human, social, organizational and philosophical issues. The interpla y between the organization and a crowd is also central when designing and undertaking a crowdsourcing process: What is the organization X  X  policy and commitment? What expertise is required from the crowd? What type of collaboration is in place? There is the need for designers to gain a deeper understanding of the non-technical factors, to mind the socio-technical gap, a nd to engage with researchers across disciplines for the design of solutions that not only drive innovation, but also seek to e nhance human values at work. Emergence of Hybrid Economic Systems Commercial economies build value with economic capital as their means of exchange. Sharing economies build value through social and symbolic capital. Both will flourish more as Internet technology develops. When co mmercial and sharing economies interact, they generate a hybrid economic system [13]. In recent years, several examples of hybrid tools leveraging crowd participation have emerged, and been successful. This model raises questions both for the or ganization and for the crowd. There is an overall need to understand the ethical issues behind those emerging collaborations. Ther e is also a need to understand how to create sustainable hybrid economies from the organization X  X  perspective; and a need for the crowd to contribute work such as by volunteering without being exploited. As relations are central in distributed work, again the interplay between organization and the crowd becomes crucial to frame, establish and maintain effective groupwork through a crowdsourcing process. Achieving Equal Representation Web 2.0 seems to have marked a shift towards a more participative and democratic culture. Regardless of the obvious problems regarding time and m eans to participate in the collaborative work -the Web is far from being a neutral space where participants are treated equa lly. Rather, research shows that social media are places where discrimination regarding gender, age and ethnicity are just as common as in other social contexts [12][16][15][16][17]. This lack of equal representation can cause severe legitimacy problems in areas where equal representation is an issue. For example, the concept of open government  X  especially in relation to Web 2.0 technology increasingly empowers society to put an unprecedented pressure on organizations to be socially responsible [14]. Too much group conformity can also create stagnation and lack of creativity. Therefore, there is a need to analyze crowdwork from a representative point of view. Here both the question of what and who is represented, and the ques tion of how discursive processes are structured, are important in the design of systems for crowdwork. The workshop is planned as a fu ll day event divided into two sessions. It will also involve additional online activities organized both before and after the workshop. At least one month prior to the workshop, the accepted positions papers will be circulated among the participants, who will be invited to read them, before attending the workshop. The participants will be also as ked to prepare a three-minute presentation to be delivered at the beginning of the workshop. Accepted papers will be posted to the workshop website before the workshop to prepare the atte ndees for discussions at the workshop. During the first session, participan ts will present and discuss their work, generating an interactive review of the current state of the art, as well as an exploration of the ways in which the trends and challenges in organizational crowdwork present opportunities to revisit and rethink the nature and design of organizational groupwork systems. The goal will be to generate themes towards the creation of a roadmap for the future of groupwork systems in the new area of open and crowd work. After a break, themed discussions of the major issues raised by the papers will occur in small groups, in order to ensure effective participation and the elicitation of varied perspectives from participants. An invited talk may also be included as an introduction and inspiration to the day, alongside short reports on the outcomes of the previous workshops that have led to this proposal. The afternoon session will combine the small group discussions with the identification of  X  X ot t opics X  that emerged, as well as discussions on post-workshop activities. The session will aim to collate all the discussions of the workshop toward jointly brainstorming a research agenda and a vision for revisiting and rethinking the design of computer-based collaborative systems to support organizations in this new area of open and crowd work. A website will be set up to publicize the workshop, organize and coordinate workshop activities, and as a means of publishing and furthering discussions on the results of workshop. In order to attract a wide range of research ers and practitioners from different disciplines, workshop organizers from diverse backgrounds including Social Computing, Learning Sciences, Human-Computer-Interaction, Computer and Systems Sciences  X  will send out the Call for Participati on to relevant professional and academic mailing lists (e.g. ACM SIGCHI Announcements; and British Computer Society HCI mailing list). The Call will be also posted on institutional and professi onal body web sites; circulated to partner organizations; advertis ed at related events that the organizers will attend (e.g. CTS 2014) and promoted on organizers X  social media (e.g. Twitter). The workshop welcomes different kinds of contributions addressing the central question of the future of groupwork in the era of crowd and open work, as well as conceptual frameworks for organizational crowdwork, de scriptions of case studies and empirical work, and position papers discussing one or more of the workshop themes. Potential particip ants will be asked to submit a position paper (approximately 2000 words) and an abstract (up to 200 words). A program committee will be drawn from collaborators, colleagues and previous workshop attendees, several of whom have already agr eed to take part. Together they will review submitted position papers based on quality, relevance and diversity. We will accept up to a maximum of 20 position papers to ensure that each participant can make a short presentation in the morning. All contributions will be will be formatted according to ACM GROUP formatting guidelines, and submitted online via a dedicated workshop email address.
