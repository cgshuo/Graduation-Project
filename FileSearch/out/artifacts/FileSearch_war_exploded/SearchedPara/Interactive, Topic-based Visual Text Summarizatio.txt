 We are building an interactive, visu al text analysis tool that aids users in analyzing a large collect ion of text. Unlike existing work in text analysis, which focuses ei ther on developing sophisticated text analytic techni ques or inventing novel visualization meta-phors, ours is tightly integrating st ate-of-the-art text analytics with interactive visualization to maximize the value of both. In this paper, we focus on describing our work from two aspects. First, we present the design and developmen t of a time-based, visual text summary that effectively conveys complex text summarization results produced by the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. Second, we describe a set of rich interaction tools that allow users to work with a created visual text summary to further interpret the summarization results in context and examine the text collection from multiple perspectives. As a re sult, our work offers two unique contributions. First, we provide an effective visual metaphor that transforms complex and even imperfect text summarization results into a comprehensible visual summ ary of texts. Second, we offer users a set of flexible visual interaction tools as the alternatives to compensate for the deficiencies of current text summarization techniques. We have a pplied our work to a number of text corpora and our evaluation shows the prom ise of the work, especially in support of complex text analyses.
 H.5.2 [User Interfaces]: Graphical user interfaces (GUI), Interac-tion styles; I.3.3 [Pic ture/Image Generation]: Viewing algorithms; H.3.1 [Content Analysis and Indexing]: Abstracting methods Design, Human Factors Interactive Text Visualization, Text Summarizati on, Topic Model, Stacked Graph The majority of information exists in the form of text. Text docu-ments, including news articles and emails, are used to convey information, share knowledge, coordi nate activities, as well as to document business conducts and proc esses. As the number of text documents increases, it becomes more time consuming and labori-ous for people to quickly locate cr itical information in a large text collection or glean insights fro m such a collection [20, 4]. To help people cope with the ev er increasing amounts of text docu-ments, researchers have develope d a number of tools facilitating text analyses. Such efforts are mainly contributed by two research communities: text analytics and information visu alization. From the text analytics community, researchers have developed a wide array of text summarization technique s (e.g., [7, 4, 21]). From the information visualization communi ty, researchers have designed a number of text visualization te chniques (e.g., [14, 15, 20]). However, there are few efforts th at tightly couple state-of-the-art text analytics with interactive visualization to maximize the value of both. For example, researcher s from the text analytics commu-nity use only basic visu alizations to display their final analysis results (e.g., matrix visualization in [13] and scatter plots in [10]). On the other hand, researchers fr om the information visualization community focus on illustrating rather simple analysis results (e.g., tf X  X df measure of keywords in [20]). Although existing techniques have achieved certain success, th ey may be inadequate in support of more complex text analyses required by many re al-world appli-cations. Consider the role of a cu stomer relationshi p manager of a hotel chain, who is examining customers X  opinions about the chain. To do so, he analyzes a large collection of texts X  X ustomer feedback posted online or sent vi a emails, to answer a set of ques-tions, including:  X  What are the major topics in the customer feedback?  X  What are the most active topics during the last three months?  X  What are the key concepts me ntioned in the above topics?  X  How have the most active topics evolve d over time? To help users answer questions li ke these, we tightly integrate interactive visualization with state-of-the-art text summarization techniques to visually summarize a large text corpus. Specifically, we are building an interactive visual text analysis tool, called TIARA (Text Insight via Automated, Responsive Analysis). In this paper, we focus on two key aspects of TIARA.
 First, TIARA uses a time-based vi sualization to explain text sum-marization results of a text collection. Currently, we use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model [2] to automatically extract a set of topics from a text collecti on. The LDA output is complex, including a set of topics, each of which is depicted by a set of key-words and their probabilistic dist ributions. To make the complex results consumable by average us ers, we design a time-based, topic-oriented visual text summ ary. Figure 1 shows a visual sum-mary created by TIARA. Each colored layer represents an LDA-derived topic. Each layer is depicted by a set of keyword clouds, summarizing the topic cont ent and the content evolution over time. The width of a layer at a time point encodes the  X  X trength X  of the topic X  X he numb er of documents covering the topic at that time. Second, TIARA provides users with rich interaction tools that allow them to further interpret and examine summarized text from multiple perspectives. Text summ arization techniques, including LDA, are less than perfect. The interaction tools provide users with alternatives to compensate for the deficiencies in these techniques. For example, a user may not u nderstand a derived topic and its associated keywords. In such case s, the user could acquire addi-tional information through a magic lens (Figure 3). Moreover, the user can investigate the meanings of a topic keyword in the context of relevant text me ssages (Figure 5). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to combine sophisticated, automatic text summ arization techniques with inter-active visualization to support an iterative, progressive text analy-sis. As a result, our work of fers two unique contributions:  X  Effective visual metaphors that transform complex and  X  Flexible visual interaction techniques that let users interact In the rest of the paper, we firs t briefly discuss the related work. We then describe the typical use of TIARA for text analysis. Finally, we highlight TIARA X  X  ke y features and our evaluation. The work on interactive text anal ysis roughly falls in two areas: text analytics and info rmation visualization. In the area of text analytics, researchers have developed a number of approaches to text summarizatio n (e.g., [7, 4, 13, 21, 22]). There are two main technique s: sentence-based [4, 21, 22] and key-word-based [13, 7] text summarization. Sentenced-based approaches identify the most sa lient sentences in a document [4, 21, 22]. However, it may be time consuming for users to read one or two sentences per document es pecially when handling a large document collection. Alternatively, keyword-based methods sum-marize documents by topics, each of which is characterized by a set of keywords [13, 7]. TIARA X  s text summarization is built on the latter method, but its focus is on visualizing the summarization results. Moreover, we provide users with visu al interaction tools to examine the results from multiple perspectives. In the area of information visual ization, research ers have devel-oped various visualization approaches to text analysis (e.g., [15, 20]. Based on the type of informat ion being visualized, these sys-tems can be classified into two categories: meta-data-based and content-based text visualization. Meta-data-based text visualiza-tion focuses on visualizing the meta data of text documents. For example, in email analysis, there are thread-based email visualiza-tions [11, 19], and relationship-ba sed visualizations of email send-ers and receivers (e.g., [14, 15], www.enronexplorer.com, and jheer.org/enron). Similarly, in text search, TileBars is used to visu-alize meta data, such as the doc ument length and query term fre-quency [9].
 Although meta-data-based vi sualization aids in te xt analysis, it can hardly help discover deeper insight s often buried in the text. Espe-cially, such visualizat ion does not work for the documents with lit-tle meta data. Thus, rese archers have developed content-based text visualization . For example, Viegas et al. build Themail to visualize keywords based on their tf X  X df scor es in an email collection. Fur-thermore, there are many other gene ral purpose text visualization systems that transform a collection of text into a visual illustration [24]. These systems include the Ga laxy of News [16], Jigsaw [18], and WordTree [23]. Based on the information being visualized, there are two types of content-ba sed text visual ization systems. The first type of systems, includi ng the Galaxy of News [16] and Jigsaw [18], focuses on depictin g document relationships. In con-trast, the second type of systems il lustrates text content at the word level, including TextArc (www.tex tarc.org), WordTree [23], and FeatureLens [6].
 Another piece of related work is ThemeRiver [8], which uses a symmetric river metaphor around the ho rizontal axis to depict the thematic variations over time within a document collection. TIARA takes an alternative approach and aims to convey much richer and far more complex text an alysis results. In doing so, not only does TIARA illustrate themat ic strength vari ations over time, but it also depicts the detailed them atic content in keywords (Fig-ure 1). Furthermore, TIARA is designed to visualize fully machine-derived, complex text summarization results, including the imperfect ones. As described later, this goal of ours also poses additional visualizat ion challenges that TIARA must address. Compared with existing text visu alization systems, TIARA visual-izes both text content and meta data to facilitate a more compre-hensive text analysis. It tightly combines state-of-the-art of text summarization techniques with inte ractive visualiz ation to support a more in-depth and practical te xt analysis. On the one hand, TIARA uses visualizations to convey complex summarization results and make them consumable . On the other hand, it offers rich visual interaction tools for users to examine text documents to compensate for the deficiencies of the summarization technology. TIARA has been used in two appl ications: email analysis and com-pany reputation analysis. In email analysis, we have used TIARA to analyze both personal and public email corpora (e.g., our own inboxes and Enron email corpus). Th e goal for email analysis is to understand the thematic content of an email collection and how the thematic content evolves over time (Figure 1). In company reputa-tion analysis, we apply TIARA to analyzing text information about a company, including news articles and forum posts collected from a number of online sources. The goa l is to examine what has been said about the company and how th e topics change over time (Fig-ure 2). For simplicity, in this paper, we mainly use the email analy-sis application to illustrate TIARA. Here we use a sample scenario in email analysis to illustrate the typical usage of TIARA. To provide users with an overview of emails, TIARA starts with a visual email summary (Figure 1). A visual summary encodes multiple pieces of inform ation, including the derived, top-N most important topics . For example, Figure 1 encodes the eight most important topics of an email collection. Each topic is distinctly colo red to be differentiated from one another. A user can examine a t opic from several aspects. First, one can view topic changes in th e form of keyword clouds distrib-uted over time. In Figure 1 the t op-most topic (green one) talks about  X  harvest , table , data ... X  in March, while discussing  X  java , code , vjit...  X  in August. Based on the varied width of a topic at dif-ferent time points, one can also observe how a topic X  X  strength (activeness) changes over time. For example, the  X  harvest  X  topic is very active in March of 2008 but less active from April to July. To words in a tool tip (Figure 1). From a visual email summary, a user can drill down to more detailed information. Assume that a user is interested in finding out more about the selected topi c segment around April (Figure 3). She uses a magic lens [1] to obt ain the senders/receivers of the emails belonging to the selected topics. Since the lens provides only the names of the senders and re ceivers, it lacks the details as how these people are related to ea ch other (e.g., frequency and pat-terns of email exchanges). To obtain such information, the user can click on the lens to bring up a deta iled network diagram (Figure 4). The owner of the email corpus is placed in the middle. There are two types of links: blue ones representing one-way communica-tions and orange ones encoding two-way communications. The closer a person is placed to the owner, more frequent email exchanges occur between the two. The user can interact with the network diagram and trigger the update of the visual text summary. For example, the user can select a sub-set of people (Figure 4a) and request the visual summary of the emails among only th ese people and the owner. Similarly, the user can view the relationship changes among the senders and receivers at different time point s. Accordingly, the updated net-work view (Figure 4b) will also tr igger the update of the visual text summary (e.g., summarizing only emails among th e people show-ing in Figure 4b). To interpret the meaning of a ke yword in a topic, a user can retrieve emails that contain the keyword. Figure 5 shows the retrieved email snippets that match the user-selected keyword  X  cotable  X . By clicking on an email sn ippet, the user can then read the full email message. To provide users with the gist of an email, TIARA also summarizes each email in keywords. A user can also interactively constrain the emails s/he may be interested. Accord-ingly, the visual summary is update d to reflect only the topics rele-http://domino.re search.ibm.com/comm/rese arch_teams.nsf/pages/ iva.download.html). This function is useful, since it allows users to analyze emails both t op-down (i.e., from t opics to individual emails) and bottom-up (i .e., from individual em ails to topics). To produce an effective text su mmarization, we have examined state-of-the-art text summarization techniques. Latent semantic models appear to be very effec tive for topic modeling and analysis (e.g., [13, 7]). Among these mode ls, previous experiments show that the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model outperforms oth-ers significantly in text summariz ation [7]. Therefore, we employ LDA in TIARA to summarize a text collection at two levels. First, we use it to automatically extract a set of latent topics for the whole text collection. Second, we use LDA to summarize each document in a set of keywords [7]. Given a text collection, the LDA method automatically learns a set of topics. Formally, each topic is defined as follows.
 Topics and Topic Keywords. A topic represents the thematic con-tent common to a set of text doc uments. Each topic is character-ized by a distribution over a set of keywords. We use the term topic keywords to refer to these keywords. Each keyword has a probabil-ity, measuring the likelihood of this keyword appearing in the related topic. Topic Strength over Time. Since TIARA currently focuses on helping users to analyze how topi cs evolve over ti me, we measure the strength of a topic at a specific time point. Assu me that a topic T summarizes the thematic content over a set of documents D . Given time t , we can then compute the distribution of topic T the sub-set of documents with time stamp t : (1) S i [t] = Here d k is the k th document in collection D ( t ), which is the set of documents at time t . Function L ( d k ) computes the normalized of topic T i in d k . Naturally, Formula 1 defines the  X  strength  X  of a topic at time t . Intuitively, stronger topics are covered by more documents in a collection. Visually, the str onger topics appear wider. In addition to summarizing a coll ection of documents, we extract a set of document keywords to describe the gi st of each document [7]. Like a topic keyword, a docu ment keyword is also associated with a score, measuring the relevance of the keyword to the docu-ment [7]. As described in Section 4, the L DA output is a set of topics and keywords that summarize the themat ic content of a text collection. In this section, we describe in detail how TIARA visualizes the text summarization results. To encode the derived topics and their cha nges over time, we have employed a stacked graph . We use colored topic layers to depict individual topics, including their ti me evolution, thematic content (topic keywords), and thematic strength (Figure 1). However, we have extended a stacked graph to convey much richer and far more complex text summarization resu lts. As described below, our extensions are made in two areas: First, we optimize the stacking order of the topic layers to produce a semantically faithful and aes-thetically pleasing stacked graph. Second, we fill each topic layer with keyword clouds at different time points to informatively con-vey the content changes over time. According to [3], there are four key steps in producing a stacked graph: (1) computing the geometry of layers, (2) layer coloring, (3) layer ordering, and (4) layer labeling. For the first step, we adopt the wiggle-minimizing method pro-posed in [3] to create a smooth t opic layer. In the second step, we use complimentary rainbow colors to differentiate adjacent layers. We also use colors to depict t opic relationships. In particular, we consider the semantic properties of topics when making color choices. Currently, we use colors in the same family with varied hues to color layers that represent semantically similar topics. For example, Topics 1 and 2 in Figure 1 are both colored in blue with different hues, since they both talk about intellectual property. We measure the semantic similarity of two topics by counting the number of the same documents belonging to both of them: (2) Here T i and T j are the i th and j th topics, to which documents D D belong, respec tively. Function C () counts the number of docu-ments. The value is normalize d to fall between [0, 1].
 While the first two steps are straight forward, the last two steps require special efforts to handle th e complexity of our text summa-rization results. The stacking order of the topic laye rs directly impacts the legibility and aesthetics of a stacked graph [3]. In our case, the distortion caused by an undesirable layer ordering can also diminish the usable space for displaying the topi c keywords within a topic layer. Figure 6 shows the same topic laye rs showing in Figure 1 stacked in a random order. In Figure 6, it may be difficult for a user to real-ize that the bottom three topic layers are flat, since their overall shape is distorted by the shape of the topic in the middle (purple one). Due to the distortion, the us able spaces within these three topic layers diminish. This latter limitation is critical to TIARA, since it needs to encode a rich amount of content (topic keywords) within each topic layer. In contrast, the bottom three layers in Fig-ure 6 are placed in the middle (Topics 0, 1, and 2) in Figure 1. Such a stacking order avoids above issues.
 Our initial experiments also found that ordering topic layers purely based on aesthetic criteria is insuff icient for text analysis. Topic ordering without considering the se mantic properties of topics may reduce the gestalt effect of perc eiving desired data associations, which in turn hinders users from discovering data patterns. In Fig-ure 7(b), the bottom two topics ar e closely related, describing two complementary efforts. The comp lementary evolution of the two topics can be easily observed in Figure 7(b). For example, during the time interval t , Topic 3 becomes increasingly more active while Topic 1 is dormant. However, such relationship would be hard to perceive in Figure 7(a) as the two topics are not placed next to each other. To create an aesthetically appealing and semantically meaningful visual text summary, we extend the layer ordering method in [3] to meet three criteria: (1) minimizing layer distortion, (2) maximizing the available space within each layer to accommodate rich the-matic content, and (3) ensuring visual proximity of layers to be proportional to their semantic similarity (Formula 2). Simultane-ously satisfying all three criteria is an optimiza tion problem. Cur-rently, we use a three-step greed y algorithm to approximate it. First, we compute the volatility of a topic layer T standard deviation of the layer heights (Formula 3). This metric states that a topic layer is  X  X ol atile X , if its strength fluctuates greatly over time. (3) V ( T i ) = . Here, h ik is the layer height at time t k ; F  X  deviation of the layer heights. Second, we sort all the topic la yers based on their volatility and start time. The least volatile one with the earliest start time is placed in the center of the graph. Third, we select the next topic layer to add in by an  X  X nside-out  X  order [3]. The next topic is selected based on its four propertie s: start time, volatility (Formula 3), semantic similarity with the previously added topic (Formula 2), and geometric complementarines s with the previous topic (For-mula 4). Step three is repeated unt il all the topic layers are added to the stacked graph. (4) GC ( T i , T j ) = .
 Consequently, our approach balanc es all three laye r-ordering crite-ria. First, it places the  X  X latter X  topic layers toward the center of the graph and curvier ones along the edge to minimize the layer distor-tion [3]. Second, it neighbors ge ometrically complementary topic layers to maximize the usable space within each layer. Third, it groups semantically similar topic layers toge ther to facilitate topic association and comparison. Unlike typical stacked graphs, which ma inly illustrate numeric trend changes with a few labels [8, 3], TIARA must convey rich text-based trend changes. In other words, the label of each layer is no longer a short text string but multiple sets of keywords, abstracting the content of a topic at different time points. Laying out these keywords in a topic layer is non-trivial, since it must sat-isfy multiple and potentially co mpeting constraints. For example, we want to display as many keywor ds as possible to informatively describe a topic while preventin g keyword overflowing across the topic boundary. Currently, our keyword placemen t method considers three factors: (1) temporal proximity, (2) cont ent legibility, and (3) content amount. The first factor states that topic keywords be placed near the most relevant time coordina te. The second criterion requires that keywords be legible, such as avoiding keyword occlusions and overflowing across topic boundaries . The third criterion attempts to maximize the use of available sp ace in a topic layer to display as many keywords as allowed. To meet all three criteri a, we develop a two-step algorithm to place t opic keywords as a series of keyword clouds along the timeline within a topic layer. First, we sort all keyword sets of a topic by their time stamp. Start-ing from the earliest time stamp, we try to find a suitable space to place the associated keyword set wi thin the topic layer. Second, we pack the keywords as a keyw ord cloud in the found space. Space Allocation. To locate a suitable space for placing a set of topic keywords at time t , we search the neighborhood of t ( t  X  X  ). words be placed near t . To ensure the legibil ity of topic keywords, TIARA also requires that a keyword be displayed in a minimal leg-ible font size or above. When evaluating the neighborhood of t , there are three possible outcomes.
 First, if there is adequate space to fit a set of keywords ( K &gt;3) in the neighborhood of time t , TIARA marks the space.
 Second, if there is no adequate space within the allowed neighbor-hood to fit a single keyword in th e minimal legible font, TIARA merges these keywords with those associated with time t +  X . It then advances to the time point t +  X  to look for suitable space. If TIARA is still unable to find a suitable sp ace, it will drop the keywords at t to ensure temporal proximity of the keyword placement (criterion 1). Otherwise, TIARA marks the space found near t +  X .
 Third, TIARA finds adequate sp ace to fit only a few keywords ( K &lt;=3). To avoid visual clutter, TIARA tries to minimize the num-ber of scattered keyword clusters wi thin a topic layer. It thus looks ahead to check the spac e around the time point t +  X . If there is ample space (area&gt;  X  ), TIARA merges the keywords at t and t +  X  and place them near t +  X . For example, TIARA merges Topic A X  X  keywords of March with those of April and places them near April (Figure 8). If both usable areas near t and t +  X  are small (i.e., each space fits fewer than 3 keywords), TIARA then combines the two areas to fit the merged keywords. The above steps are repeated until every keyword set is processed. Keyword Cloud Packing. Once TIARA finds a suitable space, it creates a keyword cloud in the allowed space. Our approach is based on Wordle (www.wordle.net) to pack keywords as tightly as possible. For computational effici ency, however we consider only spaces surrounding a packed word but not inside of it (e.g., the space available between the characters). Like Wordle, TIARA places the most important keywor ds in the center. The keyword X  X  font size is proportional to its importance but can not be smaller than the minimum legible font size . To avoid keyword  X  X verflow X , we adopt a particle-based method [ 12] to pack the keywords within the boundary of a topic layer. We pack as many keyw ords as possi-ble in a designated space as long as every displayed keyword is legible and no keyword spills over the topic boundary. Besides distributing keyword cl ouds along time within a topic layer, we also provide a tool tip to show all keywords associated with the topic (Figure 1). This vi ew offers users a topic overview regardless its thematic changes. We initially considered layi ng out topic layers only by an  X  X nside-out X  order [3]. While this layout produces a smooth and symmetric appearance (Figure 1), the symmetric layout leads to two artificial groups of topics, one on each side of the X axis. This perception may be caused by the ri ch textual inform ation displayed in each layer. To amend this situ ation, we have then experimented with an alternative layout where all topic layers are stacked on the one side of X axis. In this layout , flatter topic layers are placed near the bottom and curvier ones on the top. The resulting visual summary eliminates the artificial grouping effect and also pro-duces a more compact layout (Figur e 8). To assess the two differ-ent designs, we have consulted four visual/graphics designers. While one preferred the original design (Figure 1), three favored the other (Figure 8). Their rati onales are similar to the ones described above. As a result, we decided to use the design where all topic layers are stacked on the one side of the X axis in TIARA. To better aid users in consumin g complex text summarization results and perform deeper anal ysis, TIARA allows the users to interact with the ge nerated visual summary and examine relevant data from multiple pe rspectives. Specifical ly, we support several typical types of visual interactions.
 Topic Details on Demand. Due to the limited screen real estate, often only a sub-set of topic keywords can be displayed within a topic layer. Moreover, the narrower a topic layer, the fewer topic keywords it can accommodate. In such cases, users may find the displayed information inadequate for their tasks and would request more details about th e topic. To support such requests, TIARA allows users to interactively zoom in on a selected topic or topic segments. Currently, TIARA uses a fisheye view technique [17] to display more details of a selected topic (see more in our video). Text Information on Demand. Due to the imperfection in our text summarization results, it is often necessary to examine the meaning of topic keywords in the c ontext of the original text infor-mation. To do so, TIARA allows us ers to select any topic keyword displayed in a topic layer to re trieve the relevant documents. Instead of displaying the full retrieved documents, TIARA dis-plays only document snippets to save screen space and not to over-load users with information (Figure 5). Currently, document snippets are created based on tw o criteria: keyword match and diversity. The first criterion ensu res that a snippet contains the user-selected topic keyword. Simila r to information retrieval [5], a document may contain multiple se ntences that match the selected keyword. Our second crit erion states that a di fferent snippet (sen-tence) be used to represent a document if a similar snippet is already being used for repres enting another document. Conse-quently, diverse information is pr ovided for users to assess the meanings of interested keywords. If needed, a user can also inter-act with a document snippet to view the full document.
 Coordinated Multiview Analysis. Although topic keywords rep-resent the gist of a topic, they may be insufficient for users to fully grasp the meaning of the topic due to the terseness and potential ambiguities of the keywords. Intuit ively, this problem may be alle-viated by using n-gram instead of unigram topic keywords. How-ever, our experiments show that the quality of n-gram-based summarization largely depends on th e characteristics of a text cor-pus. For example, our n-gram-bas ed email summarization appears ineffective since most n-gram keyw ords in emails represent people names or locations (e.g., New York). As a corpus-neutral solution, TIARA allows users to interactively request additional data to help comprehend a topic. Currently, a user can request relevant meta data from a visual summary. In email analysis, users can request meta data such as sender and receiver information (e.g., Figur e 4), while in company reputation analysis, they can ask for author and news source information. The visualizations of meta data are coordinated with the visual sum-mary. As a result, users can us e multiple views simultaneously to perform their analyses. To evaluate the usefulness of TI ARA, we have applied TIARA to a number of text corpora. In email analysis, TIARA has been used to analyze two types of email corpor a. One is to let our colleagues use TIARA internally to analyze their own email archives. The other is to apply TIARA to analyze the Enron email corpus (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/ ~enron/), examining the emails of Enron key personnel. In company reputa tion analysis, we have applied TIARA to text corpora collected from various online sources for a number of companies (e.g., AIG a nd Lehman Brothers). Currently, our email analysis is limited to examining one person X  X  email archive at a time, while our company reputation analysis is on investigating one company at a time. Due to the complexity involved and time required in analyzing Enron emails and company reputa tions, we found it difficult to design realistic analysis tasks for users to perform using the Enron or the company reputation corpora w ithin a short time span (i.e., 1 5 X 30 minutes). Thus, we decided to first evaluate TIARA using the email data contribut ed by our colleagues. To evaluate the effectiveness of TIARA in support of email analy-sis, we first recruited a volunte er who had been using TIARA for several months and was willing to contribute her email collection to our study. From the email corpus contributed by this colleague, we used her emails from the year of 2008 (~10,000 emails). We worked with the email owner to identify a set of email analysis tasks, which she often performed in her work. Together we designed three types of email analysis tasks. The first type of task was the easiest. It required users to answer a set of specific ques-tions using the email corresponde nces between ju st two people. We designed this set of tasks specifically to evaluate the effective-ness of TIARA in support of simple analysis tasks like those sup-ported by Themail [20]. The second t ype of task is more difficult, asking users to answer a set of questions about a specific event, which often involves email exch anges among multipl e people. The users were provided several clues th at could be used to start the investigation. Finally, the third se t of tasks was the most difficult as it provided few clues to star t with. This type of task was intended to evaluate TIARA X  X  effectiveness in more complex anal-ysis tasks. We designed a total of 24 questions for three types of tasks. Table 1 shows a set of sample questions in each type of task. To ensure the validity of the tasks in the cont ext of TIARA, we asked the email owner to answer all the quest ions using TIARA to obtain ground-truth answers. We amende d problematic que stions based on the email owner X  X  e xperience. To accurate ly measure user per-formance (e.g., answer time) and avoid potential biases (e.g., users X  communication ca pability), we used the obtained answers to phrase each question as a multip le-choice question. For example, when asked  X  what was the most active topic in May  X , a user was presented with four possible answers: We recruited ten users, who had never used TIARA. While five of them were familiar with the ema il owner or her work, another five were not. Each user was asked to perform all the tasks. To avoid potential biases such as learni ng effects, we randomly permuted the order of tasks.
 At the beginning of each user sessi on, we gave a brief tutorial of TIARA. Each user was allotted 15 minutes for each task. The user was asked to fill in an evaluation survey after each task. We logged the user X  X  answers to all questions and recorded all user interac-tions and the time used for answering each question.
 To compare user performance across the three types of tasks, we used both objective and subjecti ve measures. Our three objective measures were derived from the log data: answer completion rate (percentage of the answered questions), answer error rate (per-centage of incorrect answers), and answer time (the time spent on each question). For each task, we computed the mean answer com-pletion rate, error rate, and answer time across all the users and questions. Our three subjective measures were extracted from the user surveys: usefulness (how useful a system is for the task at hand), usability (how easy to use a system for the task at hand), and system satisfaction . All the subjective measures were rated on a 5-point scale, with 1 being th e worst and 5 being the best. Fur-thermore, we asked the participants to indicate their most and least liked features of TIARA, and sugges t additional features to enhance email analysis. We examined both objective and s ubjective data co llected from our study. Figure 9 shows users X  perform ance in three types of tasks by all measures except answer completion rate, since the answer com-pletion rate is 100% across all users and all tasks. Objectively, TIARA helped users better perform more complex tasks (Tasks 2 and 3) (Figure 9a X  X ). Subjectively , users favored TIARA more for helping them complete more complex tasks (Tasks 2 and 3) (Fig-ure 9c). Except the answer completion rate, users X  performance varied in answer time and error rate when using TIARA to handle different types of tasks. First, users finish ed Task 2 the fastest (82 seconds), then Task 3 (104 seconds), and Task 1 (194 seconds). While the time difference between Tasks 2 a nd 3 was insignificant, the differ-ences between Tasks 1 and 2 (p&lt;0.000), and Tasks 1 and 3 (p&lt;0.005) were statistically significantly (Figure 9a). Second, users X  mean answer error rates differed across tasks, although none of the differences was significant (Figure 9b). All users completed Task 1 correctly, but with an error rate of 8% and 12% in Task 3 and Task 2, respectively. We analyzed how various factors, such as task type and users X  knowledge, might have impacted answer t ime and error rate. ANOVA tests found that only the task type (p&lt;0.000) had influ-enced the answer time significantly. To better understand these results, we further examined the nature of the tasks and TIARA X  X  usage. From our logs, we first investi-gated why users spent the most time on the simplest task (Task 1). Task 1 required the users to study email corres pondences between two people. However, TIARA provided the summary of the whole email set, which required the users to locate the relevant topics first in the visual summary before obtaining answers. On the oppo-site, more difficult tasks like Tasks 2 and 3 required the users to have a good understanding of the entire email collection. TIARA X  X  visual summary precisely provide d the users with a quick under-standing of all the emails. Moreove r, we observed that the users used the provided clues to jump start their investigations. For example, Task 2 asked questions about a project named  X  X obra X . Almost all users started with findi ng the topics relevant to  X  X obra X  (containing topic keywor d  X  X obra X ) in the presented visual sum-mary. After locating the relevant topics, they then examined the emails under these topics. In contra st, Task 3 provide d little clues for the users to start with. They had to examine each topic in the summary before coming up with the answers. This perhaps explained why the users finished Task 2 the fastest.
 Although our users took the longest time in finishing Task 1, they had completed the task perfectly. In contrast, they made small mis-takes in both Tasks 2 and 3. Wh en examining these mistakes, we found that most of the mistakes we re related to qu estions requiring careful detailed analysis. For ex ample, one such question was ask-ing the users to identify a list of people involved in a project. Although candidate lists were provided as mul tiple choices, the users still needed to examine the details of relevant emails before making a selection. Currently , TIARA does not automatically extract and highlight the relations hips between people and events. It thus did not dire ctly help our users in such cases. Overall, our users thought that TI ARA was more useful and usable for more complex tasks (Tasks 2 and 3), and were more satisfied with TIARA in such tasks (Figure 9c). T-tests showed that the user opinions differed significantly in all three measures between sim-ple and complex tasks: usefulness (Tasks 1 and 2 p&lt;0.001), usabil-ity (Tasks 1 and 2, Tasks 1 and 3, p&lt;0.000), and sa tisfaction (Tasks was the only factor that impacted usefulness (p&lt;0.02), usability (p&lt;0.000), and satisfaction (p&lt;0.0 02) significantly. Users X  famil-iarity with the email owner X  X  work also impacted usability signifi-cantly (p&lt;0.004). Again, users X  subject opinions confirmed our above analysis about TIARA X  X  ef fectiveness in various tasks: TIARA helped users more in more complex analysis tasks. When asked about their opinions of TIARA X  X  key features, nine out of ten participants (90%) indicated that they liked the visual email summary the best. Seven out of ten (70%) participants stated that they least liked TIARA X  X  inability to identify various semantic entities (e.g., people and events) i nvolved in the extracted topics. In turn, this deficiency of TIAR A did not aid users in performing detailed analysis (e.g., identify ing people involved in an event To better understand the rationale behind their preferences, we fur-ther studied the participants X  comments. Their comments were consistent with our analysis. Ov erall, TIARA was favored for two main reasons. First, TIARA X  X  visu al summary helped users gain a quick understanding of the underl ying emails. Almost all users (90%) commented on how easily th ey could use TIARA to identify topics and observe content chan ges over time. Furthermore, we observed that participants who were familiar with the email owner X  X  work often used their knowledge to eliminate impossible answers. As a result, users who could use their knowledge to quickly find the desired informati on in a visual summary tended to value TIARA more. For example, one user commented:  X  There is a lot of information ( in this summary ) . But I know these ( pointing to some topics ) are irrelevant, so I focus on...  X . This helps explain why a user X  X  knowledge impac ted the usability measure. Second, users liked TIARA X  X  inte raction tools that provided them the versatility to examine email data from multiple angles. For example, one user commented,  X ... I did not know what these key-words meant. But it is good that I could look them up in the emails ... X  We also observed that users switched often between a visual summary, the email snippets, and the full email messages to glean information. For sanity check, we also asked our participants to assess whether Themail [20] could be used to pe rform the three types of tasks. We designed a set of simila r but not identical ques tions. As a result, all our users had great difficulties in using Themail to finish Tasks 2 and 3. They clearly i ndicated that Themail was unfit for Tasks 2 and 3. In Task 1 that Themail wa s designed for, it was interesting to observe that TIARA outperformed Themail in both answer com-pletion rate (100% vs. 95%) and e rror rate (0% vs. 20%). However, Themail outperformed TIARA in an swer time (171.55 secs vs. 1 94.65 secs). This result was in ac cordance with our previous find-ing. Themail provided users with just the right amount of informa-tion for the task. In contrast, TIARA provided a summary of all emails, costing users more time to filter out irrelevant emails. However, the simple tf X  X df-based keyword display in Themail was not powerful enough for users to easi ly identify topics and observe thematic changes even within the emails betw een two people. Thus, TIARA helped answer more questions and more accurately. During our study, we asked the participants X  preferences on the two layouts, symmetric (Figure 1) and asymmetric layout (Figure 8). Five out of ten (50%) users preferred the asymmetric layout. They considered the layout more  X  X  atural X , and like d that it packed the topic layers tightly for easy comparison. In contrast, they per-ceived a  X  X ivided X  visualization in a symmetric layout, consisting of two parts, one on each side of X axis. They considered the  X  X ivi-sion X  an extra burden for compre hending the graph. Three (30%) users favored the symmetric layout. They felt the visualization was less distorted and thus more topic content could be shown. The remaining two users (20%) had no preference.
 The participants X  feedback also re vealed the current limitations of TIARA. Eight of ten (80%) user s expressed the need to provide feedback through visual interactio n to improve the text analytics. For example, Topics 1 and 2 in Fi gure 1 should really be one topic. Several users wished that they c ould merge them together to avoid confusion. While visua lly merging the two topics may be easy, it is difficult to feed the merged results back to the LDA engine to enhance its future perfo rmance. Because of th e terseness of topic keywords, several users also sugge sted that TIARA label each key-word with its semantic category to visually distinguish various concepts (e.g., people versus pl ace). Since this feature involves named entity recognition, a research topic itself, we are exploring how to combine it with the LDA method used in TIARA. Several users also expr essed their desire to examine additional top-ics instead of just the top-N most important ones. Scaling a visual summary to accommodate a number of topics is non trivial for sev-eral reasons. First, we need to pr operly label the topics so they can be easily identified. However, it is difficult to uniquely label an LDA-derived topic. We are expl oring how to use a small set of keywords to label such a topic. Moreover, topic layers are ordered by three criteria (Sec 5.2). Since the screen real estate is always limited, at certain point we must minimize or hide displayed topics in order to show new topics. In su ch cases, it is unclear whether we should re-order the entire stack of topics or just incrementally order the new ones for the sake of performance and visual continu-ity. In this paper, we present an intera ctive, visual text analysis tool, called TIARA. TIARA supports both top-down and bottom-up visual text analysis. In a top-down process, TIARA provides a user with a visual summary of a text corpus. The user can drill down to specific text snippets and origin al text messages to better under-stand the summarized t opics and topic keywords in context. In a bottom-up process, a user starts with a small set of text documents. Based on their content, the user ma y be interested in analyzing an expanded set of text documents . Accordingly, TIARA creates a visual summary of the expanded se t. From the created visual sum-mary, the user can then start another round of analysis.
 As a result, TIARA provides users w ith two distinct benefits. First, its visual summary provides users a quick overview of a large col-lection of text information, wh ich helps them understand the the-matic changes over time , and enables them to make rapid decisions on where they need to dig deeper. Second, TIARA offers users with a flexible set of interaction tools that help them digest text summaries in context, and examine relevant text information from multiple angles to compensate for the deficiencies of current text summarization technology. Our pr eliminary evaluation also dem-onstrates that TIARA effectively aids users in their text analysis tasks, especially in the more complex tasks.
