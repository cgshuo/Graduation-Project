 over the past 15 years. These include the use of near infrared spectroscopy coupled with data mining as an alternate laboratory technique for predicting compound concentr ations in soil and plant samples, and the analysis of gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) data, a technique used to determine in environmental app lications, for example, the petroleum content in soil and water samples. I will then briefly discuss how experience with these applications has led to the development of an open-source fram ework for applica tion development. MANAGEMENT: H.2.8 Database appl ications: Subjects: Data mining Author Keywords: Data Mining Application; Environmental Science Geoffrey Holmes is Dean of the F aculty of Computing and Mathematic al Sciences at the University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand. He recei ved a Ph.D. in mathematics from Southampton University in 1986. Following a research position at the engineering Department, Cambridge University, UK, he joined the Computer Science Department at Waikato. His research interests include topics in machine learning, data st ream mining, open-source machine learning and application development. He is a senior member of the Waikato machine learning group that have provided open-source solutions to the community su ch as WEKA and MOA. He has been actively involved in promoting open-source for machine l earning and is an action editor for JMLR MLOSS. He has extensive experience of application de velopment and the provision frameworks for data mining and data stream mining application development. Most recently, he has been working on instance-incremental methods for data streams across a wide range of tasks.
