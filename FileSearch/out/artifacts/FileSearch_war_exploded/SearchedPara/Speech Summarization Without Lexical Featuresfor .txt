 Speech summarization, a technique of extracting key segments that convey the main content from a spoken document or audio document, has be-come a new area of study in the last few years. There has been much significant progress made in speech summarization for English or Japanese text and audio sources (Hori and Furui, 2003; Inoue et al., 2004; Koumpis and Renals, 2005; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2003; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2005). Some research efforts have focused on summariz-ing Mandarin sources (Chen et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2005), which are dependent on lexical fea-tures. Considering the difficulty in obtaining high quality transcriptions, some researchers proposed speech summarization systems with non-lexical fea-tures (Inoue et al., 2004; Koumpis and Renals, 2005; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2003; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006). However, there does not exist any empirical study on speech summarization with-out lexical features for Mandarin Chinese sources. In this paper, we construct our summarizer with acoustic and structural features, which are indepen-dent of lexical features, and compare acoustic and structural features against lexical features as predic-tors of summary sentences.

In Section 2 we review previous work on broad-cast news summarization. We describe the Mandarin broadcast news corpus on which our system operates in Section 3. In Section 4 we describe our summa-rizer and these features used in experiments. We set up our experiments and evaluate the results in Sec-tion 5, followed by our conclusion in Section 6. There have been many research efforts on speech summarization. Some methods dependent on lexi-cal features are presented (Inoue et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2005). (Inoue et al., 2004) uses statistical methods to identify words to include in a summary, based on linguistic and acous-tic/prosodic features of the Japanese broadcast news transcriptions; while (Chen et al., 2006) proposes the use of probabilistic latent topical information for extractive summarization of Mandarin spoken docu-ments. (Huang et al., 2005) presents Mandarin spo-ken document summarization scheme using acous-tic, prosodic, and semantic information. Alterna-tively, some methods which are independent of lex-ical features are presented (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2003; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006). (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2003) extracts structural informa-tion from audio documents to help summarization. (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006) focuses on how to use acoustic information alone to help predict sen-tences to be included in a summary and shows a novel way of using continuous HMMs for summa-rizing speech documents without transcriptions.
It is advantageous to build speech summarization models without using lexical features: we can sum-marize speech data without placing a stringent de-mand on the speech recognition accuracy. In this pa-per, we propose one such model on Mandarin broad-cast news and compare the effectiveness of acous-tic and structural features against lexical features as predictors of summary sentences. We use a portion of the 1997 Hub4 Mandarin corpus available via LDC as experiment data. The related audio data were recorded from China Central Tele-vision(CCTV) International News programs. They include 23-day broadcast from 14th January, 1997 to 21st April, 1997, which contain 593 stories and weather forecasts. Each broadcast lasts approxi-mately 32 minutes, and has been hand-segmented into speaker turns. For evaluation, we manually annotated these broadcast news, and extracted seg-ments as reference summaries. We divide these broadcast news stories into 3 types: one-turn news, weather forecast, and several-turns news. The con-tent of each several-turn news is presented by more than one reporter, and sometimes interviewees. We evaluate our summarizer on the several-turns news corpus. The corpus has 347 stories which contain 4748 sentences in total. 4.1 Acoustic/Prosodic Features Acoustic/prosodic features in speech summarization system are usually extracted from audio data. Re-searchers commonly use acoustic/prosodic variation  X  changes in pitch, intensity, speaking rate  X  and du-ration of pause for tagging the important contents of their speeches (Hirschberg, 2002). We also use these features for predicting summary sentences on Mandarin broadcast news.
 Our acoustic feature set contains thirteen features: DurationI , DurationII , SpeakingRate , F0I , F0II , F0III , F0IV , F0V , EI , EII , EIII , EIV and EV . Du-rationI is the sentence duration. DurationII is the average phoneme duration. General phonetic stud-ies consider that the speaking rate of sentence is re-flected in syllable duration. So we use average syl-lable duration for representing SpeakingRate . F0I is F0 X  X  minimum value. F0II is F0 X  X  maximum value. F0III equals to the difference between F0II and F0I . F0IV is the mean of F0. F0V is F0 slope. EI is min-imum energy value. EII is maximum energy value. EIII equals to the difference between EII and EI . EIV is the mean of energy value. EV is energy slope. We calculate DurationI from the annotated manual transcriptions that align the audio documents. We then obtain DurationII and SpeakingRate by pho-netic forced alignment. Next we extract F0 fea-tures and energy features from audio data by using Praat (Boersma and Weenink, 1996). 4.2 Structural Features Each broadcast news of the 1997 Hub4 Mandarin corpus has similar structure, which starts with an an-chor, followed by the formal report of the story by other reporters or interviewees.
 Our structural feature set consists of 4 features: Position , TurnI , TurnII and TurnIII . Position is de-fined as follows: one news has k sentences, then we set (1  X  (0 / k )) as Position value of the first sentence in the news, and set (1  X  (( i  X  1) / k )) as Position value of the i th sentence. TurnI is defined as follows: one news has m turns, then we set (1  X  (0 / m )) as TurnI value of the sentences which belong to the first turn X  X  content, and set (1  X  (( j  X  1) / m )) as TurnI values of the sentences which belong to the j th turn X  X  content. TurnII is the previous turn X  X  TurnI value. TurnIII is the next turn X  X  TurnI value. 4.3 Reference Lexical Features Most methods for text summarization mainly utilize lexical features. We are interested in investigating the role of lexical features in comparison to other features. All reference lexical features are extracted from the manual transcriptions.
 Our lexical feature set contains eight features: LenI , LenII , LenIII , NEI , NEII , NEIII , TFIDF and Cosine . For a sentence, we set the number of words in the sentence as LenI value. LenII is the previous sentence X  X  LenI value. LenIII is the next sentence X  X  LenI value. For a sentence, we set the number of Named Entities in the sentence as the NEI value. We define the number of Named Enti-ties which appear in the sentence at the first time in a news as NEII value. NEIII value equals to the ra-tio of the number of unique Named Entities to the number of all Named Entities.

TFIDF is the product of tf and idf . tf is the frac-tion: the numerator is the number of occurrences of the considered word and the denominator is the number of occurrences of all words in a story. idf is the logarithm of the fraction: the numerator is the to-tal number of sentences in the considered news and the denominator is the number of sentences where the considered word appears. Cosine means cosine similarity measure between two sentence vectors. 4.4 Summarizer Our summarizer contains the preprocessing stage and the estimating stage. The preprocessing stage extracts features and normalizes all features by equation (1).

Here, w j is the original value of feature j which is used to describe sentence i ; mean ( w j ) is the mean value of feature j in our training set or test set; dev ( w j ) is the standard deviation value of feature j in our training set or test set.

The estimating stage predicts whether each sen-tence of the broadcast news is in a summary or not. We use Radial Basis Function(RBF) kernel for con-structing SVM classifier as our estimator referring to LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001), which is a library for support vector machines. We use the several-turn news corpus, described in Section 3, in our experiments. We use 70% of the corpus consisting of 3294 sentences as training set Feature Set SR10% SR15% SR20% Ave Ac+St+Le .5961 .546 .5544 .5655 Ac+St .5888 .5489 .5562 .5646 St .5951 .5616 .537 .5645 Le .5175 .5219 .5329 .5241 Ac .3068 .4092 .4582 .3914 Baseline .21 .32 .43 .32 and the remaining 1454 sentences as held-out test set, upon which our summarizer is tested.

We measure our summarizer X  X  performance by precision, recall, and F-measure (Jing et al., 1998). We explain these metrics as follows:
In equation (2), (3) and (4), S man is the sentence set of manual summaries or reference summaries; S sum is the sentence set of predicted summaries pro-vided by our summarizer.

We have three versions of reference summaries based on summarization ratio(SR): 10%, 15% and 20% respectively. So we build three baselines re-ferring to different versions of reference summaries. When using SR 10% summaries, we build the base-lines by choosing the first 10% of sentences from each story. Our baseline results in F-measure score are given in Table 1.

We perform three sets of experiments with differ-ent summarization ratios.

By using acoustic and structural features alone, the summarizer produces the same performance as by using all features. We can find the evidence from Table 1 and Figure 1. On average, the combination of acoustic and structural features yields good per-formance: F-measure of 0.5646, 24.46% higher than the baseline, only 0.09% lower than the average F-measure produced by using all features. This find-ing makes it possible to summarize speech without placing a stringent demand on the speech recogni-tion accuracy.

In the same Mandarin broadcast program, the dis-tribution and flow of summary sentences are rela-tively consistent. Therefore, compared with speech summarization on English sources, we can achieve the different finding that structural features play a key role in speech summarization for Mandarin broadcast news. Table 1 shows the evidence. On average, structural features are superior to lexical features: F-measure of 0.5645, 24.45% higher than the baseline and 4,04% higher than the average F-measure produced by using lexical features.

Another conclusion we can draw from Table 1 is that acoustic features are important for speech summarization on Mandarin broadcast news. On average, even by using acoustic features alone our summarizer yields competitive result: F-measure of 0.3914, 7.14% higher than the baseline. The similar conclusion also holds for speech summarization on English sources (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006). In this paper, we have presented the results of an empirical study on speech summarization for Man-darin broadcast news. From these results, we found that by using acoustic and structural features alone, the summarizer produces good performance: aver-age F-measure of 0.5646, the same as by using all features. We also found that structural features make more important contribution than lexical features to speech summarization because of the relatively con-sistent distribution and flow of summary sentences in the same Mandarin broadcast program. Moreover, we have shown that our summarizer performed sur-prisingly well by using only acoustic features: av-erage F-measure of 0.3914, 7.14% higher than the baseline. These findings also suggest that high qual-ity speech summarization can be achieved without stringent requirement on speech recognition accu-racy.
