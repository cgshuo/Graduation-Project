 Scaling web applications like recommendation systems, search and computational advertising is challenging. Such systems have to make astronomical number of decisions every day on what to serve users when they are visiti ng the website and/or using the mobile app. Machine learning and statistical modeling approaches that can obtain insights by continuously processing large amounts of data emitted at very high freque ncy by these applications have emerged as the method of choice. However, there are three challenges to scale such methods: a) scientific b) infrastructure and c) organizational. I will provide an overview of these challenges and the strategies we have adopted at LinkedIn to address those. Throughout, I will illustrate with examples from real-world applications at LinkedIn..
