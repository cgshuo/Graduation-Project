 1989 as a Nordic conference on IS Engineering, and hosted again in 1990 and in 2000. Over the time CAiSE has established itself as a leading venue of information systems engineering. It is a forum of exchange for researchers, industrials, and students, as well as a place to learn, identify future trends, and start new collaborations. tegrity in Information Systems Engineering (CAISE). As systems are moving beyond traditional information management and need to organically blend into the environ-ment, appealing to large and diverse user bases  X  creativity, ability, and integrity are some important components to address. Creativity is becoming ever more important as Information Systems are designed in novel and unexpected ways making use of infor-mation from different sources that need to be merged and molded to become meaningful and valuable. Ability enables systems to be capable of delivering business in excellent, competitive, and agile way. The task of integrity is to ensure quality in ethical codes  X  modifications by authorized parties, or only in authorized ways.

The papers reflected different topics  X  models, methods, techniques, architectures, platforms, as wel l as domain-specific, multi aspect, and new-generation solutions in the information systems engineering discipline. Each submitted paper was evaluated by at least three independent members of the Program Committee (PC), further the papers were discussed online under the supervision of a member of the Program Board (PB), and again at the PB meeting held in Stockholm during February 5 X 6, 2015.

The tutorials reflected various topics, such as business-IT alignment, matching of IS models, know-how to organize, map, and manage knowledge by IT means, IT change management, as well as design science for IS/IT.
 As a tradition at CAiSE, the conference program was preceded by 10 workshops and 2 associated working conferences: EMMSAD and BPMDS. Separate proceedings were published for all these events. The main conference included research paper sessions, tutorials, panels, doctoral Symposium, forum for short visionary papers, case studies, and tools X  applications, as well as a whole-day industry track dedicated to the subject of Big Data and Business Analytics.
 In our role as the editors of this volume, we owe special thanks to the authors sub-mitting their novel research results to the conference; members of the Program Com-mittee and Program Board for promoting t he conference, their support in attracting submissions, as well as for providing valuable reviews for the submitted papers. We also thank the external reviewers. Special thanks go to Richard van de Stadt who timely and efficiently helped us with the CyberChairPRO conference management system. Finally, we warmly thank the Department o f Computer and Systems Sciences (DSV) of Stockholm University and its local organization team, publicity chairs, workshop orga-nization chairs, forum chairs, tutorial and panel chairs, doctoral symposium chairs, and industry track chairs.
