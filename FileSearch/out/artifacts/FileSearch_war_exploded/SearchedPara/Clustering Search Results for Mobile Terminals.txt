 Mobile terminals such as cell phones are much more re-stricted in terms of input/output functionality and, there-fore, some special techniques must be incorporated to enable them to be easily used for Web searching. Further, search-ing for a location name is related to a dazzling variety of topics. We relate these two factors to each other to yield a new search system for map and text information. Present-ing search results as clusters is helpful for users, especially in a mobile environment. The system makes mobile web searching easier and more efficient.

A sample situation motivated our system as follows: As-sume that you happen to come to Shinjuku ,ahotspotin Tokyo, on business. After finishing your work, you might wonder if there is anything interesting in Shinjuku. You then try to find information using your mobile phone. However, it is difficult and inconvenient to search text information and a map using a mobile phone, which is much more limited in terms of input/output functionality than a PC. We have al-ready developed a model for classifying a set of search results into intuitive clusters[1]. We modify the proposed model for a mobile environment to yield a system that makes proper names-related retrieval easier and more comfortable.
In situations such as the one described above, proper nouns, say Shinjuku , constitute a query term. Empirically, small text areas near a query term con tain information about it. However, small text areas surrounding proper nouns in a searched document are not necessarily rich in information about the name. A proper noun provides a background in return for a topic. We have observed that text areas sur-rounding the related terms of proper nouns provide consid-erable information about the topics. Here, related terms are submitted by general users in conjunction with the query. Related terms clustering in a mobile environment : Our system gathers terms related to a query and text areas surrounded by the related terms via a Web search API[2]. Then, the related terms are grouped into clusters and uti-lized as labels of search results clusters. Because our system tries to optimize the limited space of mobile terminals, the clustering process considers the length of terms as well as the frequency of term co-occurrence.
 Associative search via proximate terms : Several terms near the related terms may attract the attention of the user, becausetheseproximatetermsarerelatedtoboththequery and the related terms. Our system enables users to search for proximate terms. The terms displayed on the screen have two links: a link to search for associable terms and a link to search for associable text. A user begins searching from clusters of related terms (mentioned above) and then selects favorable terms. If the user clicks on a term itself, then he/she moves to the text search for this term. If the user clicks on a link button near a term, the associable terms for that term are searched by the term and shown to the user. Associable terms can be searched successively using a recursive search by one or more terms. [1] Yasukawa, M., Yokoo, H.: Related Terms Clustering for [2] Yahoo!JAPAN Developer Network,
