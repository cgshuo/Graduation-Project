 As the volume of publications has increased dramatically, an urgent need has developed to assist researchers in locating high-quality, candidate-cited papers from a research repository. Traditional schol-arly recommendation approaches ignore the chronological nature of citation recommendations. In this study, we propose a novel method called "Chronological Citation Recommendation" which assumes initial user information needs could shift while users are searching for papers in different time slices. We model the informa-tion-need shifts with two-level modeling: dynamic time-related ra-nking feature construction and dynamic evolving feature weight training. In more detail, we employed a supervised document in-fluence model to characterize the content "time-varying" dynam-ics and constructed a novel heterogeneous graph that encapsulates dynamic topic-based information, time-decay paper/topic citation information, and word-based information. We applied multiple meta-paths for different ranking hypotheses which carried different types of information for citation recommendation in various time slices, along with information-need shifting. We also used multiple learning-to-rank models to optimize the feature weights for differ-ent time slices to generate the final "Chronological Citation Recom-mendation" rankings. The use of Chronological Citation Recom-mendation suggests time-series ranking lists based on initial user textual information need and characterizes the information-need shifting. Experiments on the ACM corpus show that Chronolog-ical Citation Recommendation can significantly enhance citation recommendation performance.

 Chronological Citation Recommendation, Information-Need Shift-ing, Supervised Dynamic Topic Modeling, Heterogeneous Graph Mining, Learning to Rank
Finding and reading potential candidate articles for citation is es-sential to good research. Recent systematic efforts, such as Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search, exist to serve this need. Given the explosion of scientific papers, however, researchers are plagued by information overload, such as an overwhelming list of retrieved publications based on a textual query. To solve this problem, researchers have proposed a number of different solutions to effectively recommend high-quality papers to scholars. Along-side classic textual information retrieval and recommendation ap-proaches, topic information and link information between papers, such as citation relationships, have been proven to enhance recom-mendation performance [4, 10, 13].

The important chronological nature of citation recommendation, however, has been ignored in previous studies. From a citation recommendation standpoint, an information need may feature dif-ferent variations depending on varying time slices. For instance, as Figure 1 shows, if a scholar X  X  query (initial information need) is related to "Latent Dirichlet Allocation," he/she is most likely in-terested in the papers focusing on this theme that had been most recently published. However, the scholar X  X  information need could implicitly shift if he/she needs to investigate earlier publications. For instance, given the same query, the scholar might be interested in publications focusing on "Latent Semantic Indexing" or "Prob-abilistic Latent Semantic Indexing" between 1990 and 2000, and "Word Clustering" or "Probability Theory" studies published be-fore 1990. The information need can also be more complex than a static model based on a single method of feature representation and ranking fusion. The importance of the varying ranking fea-tures may also shift in different time slices. For example, for any given targeted text query, users may prefer classical readings pub-lished decades ago related to (but not necessarily similar as) the query (i.e., revealed by PageRank or random walk), and they may be interested in the more recent studies similar to the query (i.e., revealed by language model or topic model). No single existing model can cover this kind of shifting. In this study, we define this phenomenon as "Information-Need Shifting. X  It challenges most of the existing text-or citation-based search methods, which gen-erate a general list of papers based on a static recommendation or retrieval model.
 Figure 1: Diagrammatic sketch of information-need shifting
Modeling information-need shifting is significant for citation rec-ommendation in that a large number of cited papers may not be similar or share the same topic as the citing article or textual query. Modeling information-need shifting can be especially important for junior scholars (exploratory tasks [15]), interdisciplinary studies, and review tasks. In this paper, we characterize the information-need shifting from two different viewpoints: (1) Dynamic chrono-logical feature extraction and (2) Dynamic evolving feature weight training. With dynamic chronological feature extraction, we es-timate the chronological information-need shifting based on the three indicators: dynamic topic-based information , e.g., scientific topic evolution, topic mixture proportion in a paper or a paper X  X  top-ical influence; citation relationships between papers or topics ; and word information , e.g., TFIDF. All of these indicators are concep-tualized as the various meta-paths on an innovative heterogeneous chronological graph as time-related ranking features. With dy-namic evolving feature weight training, after harvesting all the dy-namic ranking features, the information-need shifting (chronolog-ical citation recommendation) problem is characterized by a num-ber of learning-to-rank models (in which each model estimates an information need on a specific time slice) to optimize the feature weights for different time slices and capture the weight evolving trajectory. We estimated the effect of information-need shifting by evaluating the citation recommendation performance for different historical periods.

The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a novel chronological citation recommendation method to assist scholars in more effectively identifying and accessing the recom-mendation results, and better understanding the discipline X  X  devel-opment (given a textual query). Chronological citation recommen-dation, unlike most existing efforts, considers information-need shift-ing and generates multiple lists of ranked papers for a given num-ber of time slices. Second, we propose an innovative approach to characterize the information-need shifting by employing two-level modeling: (1) We construct the time-related ranking features from the time-decayed citation relations between papers/topics, dynamic topic-based information and word information. All of these indica-tors are addressed by a number of meta-path features, plus a ran-dom walk algorithm, on an innovative heterogeneous graph. (2) We apply learning-to-rank algorithms, plus dynamic graph-based fea-ture integration, to optimize the feature weights and capture the fea-ture importance evolution. Information-need shifting, then, is char-acterized as the time-series recommendation ranking models. Each ranking model will be utilized to optimize the publication ranking results for a distinct time slice. To the best of our knowledge, few prior studies addressed these problems.

In the remainder of this paper, we: (1) propose our novel method for chronological citation recommendation via supervised dynamic topic modeling, heterogeneous graph mining and learning-to-rank methods; (2) review relevant literature and methodology; (3) de-scribe the experiment setting and evaluation results; and (4) discuss the findings and limitations of the study and identify subsequent re-search steps.
In this section, we propose an innovative method for chronolog-ical citation recommendation by estimating user information-need shifting. In more detail, in section 2.1, we propose a supervised dy-namic topic model for characterizing the publication topic dynam-ics and publication topical influence. We then construct a novel heterogeneous graph, in section 2.2, to integrate dynamic topic-based information, citation relationship, and word information for chronological citation recommendation. Twenty-three meta-path-based ranking features are employed on the graph along with ran-dom walk algorithm. In section 2.3, we estimate user information-need shifting by using learning-to-rank method, and generate chrono-logical citation recommendation results.
Publication content and its associated latent topics provide the first kind of important information for user information-need shift-ing estimation. Topic models are useful tools for analyzing the words of texts to discover the patterns of terms in document collec-tions. In most previous studies, a topic, namely a term distribution, was always static. However, this assumption is oversimplified and is inappropriate for scholarly publication collections. For example, the content of a research paper discussing "Information Retrieval" in 1990 can be very different from a similar study from 2010. That motivates us to use a dynamic topic model that enables an algorithm to estimate topic change over time and characterize the content dy-namics in a corpus. In this paper, we assume that scientific topics are evolving over time, and the evolving topics located in different time slices are interconnected in a historical trajectory.
Dynamic topic model (DTM) [1] has been demonstrated as a useful tool which can explicitly model the dynamics of the under-lying topics. DTM introduces a Markov chain of term distributions to capture probabilities that drift over time. It models the docu-ments of each time slice with a K -component topic model, where the topics associated with slice t evolve from the topics associated with previous slice t -1 : The natural parameter  X  t,k is considered as the term distribution at time slice t for topic k , where  X  2 is the transition variance. Based on DTM, Gerrish and Blei [8] proposed the document influence model (DIM). In DIM, a normally distributed influence score l is assigned to each article which is a scalar value that describes the influence that article d has on the topic k . Topic drift is similar as DTM, where DIM restricts attention to the influence score for that topic and to the words of each document that are assigned to it: Here, z d,n,k is the indicator that the n th word in document d is assigned to topic k . DIM assumes that the higher the influence, the more the words of the article affect how the topic drifts.
Though DIM tracks the language dynamic successfully, it has some limitations. The topics learned from the model are hard to interpret, and the number setting of topics in a corpus is arbitrary (as are other unsupervised LDA methods). Meanwhile, DTM and DIM ignore the citation relations between scientific articles, which should be important to estimate information-need shifting. Schol-arly publication collections, unlike other kinds of corpora, pro-vide very rich metadata, i.e., author-provided keyword and citation metadata. This characteristic motivates us to use scientific meta-data to enhance the dynamic topic evolution performance. As with DIM, we posit K topic trajectories, and the document set of each time slice is modeled with a supervised topic model Labeled LDA (LLDA) [18]. LLDA associates individual words in a document with their most appropriate labels (keywords). In this study, the labels are author-provided keywords (for each paper). The num-ber of topics in LLDA is the number of unique keyword labels K in the corpus. This makes our model a "Supervised Document In-fluence Model" (SDIM). The graphical representation of the super-vised document influence model is depicted in Figure 2.
 Figure 2: Graphical representation of the supervised document in-fluence model
As Figure 2 shows, K is the number of topic labels in all time slices; T is the number of time slices; time slice T is the latest time slice; time slice 1 is the earliest; and D is the publication set. D = { D 1 ,D 2 ,...D T } , where D i ( 1  X  i  X  T ) is the papers published in time slice i ; W represents the word; V = W 1 ,W 2 ,...,W represents the vocabulary of the corpus; N d represents the word number of document d ; z n,k is the word-topic assignment;  X  is a multinomial distribution representing the topic mixture propor-tions;  X  is a Dirichlet prior distribution;  X  t,k is topic k associated with slice t ; l represents the document X  X  influences over topics;  X  is a binary vector of document X  X  labels;  X  represents a labeling prior probability.

For each document, the traditional DIM draws a multinomial mixture distribution  X  over all K topics from a Dirichlet prior  X  . However, in SDIM, for each document d , we would like to restrict  X  to be defined only over the topics that correspond to its labels (pa-per X  X  keywords). Since the word-topic assignment z n,k is drawn from  X  , this restriction ensures that all the topic assignments are limited to the document X  X  keyword labels. To achieve this objec-tive, we generate the document X  X  labels  X  using a Bernoulli coin toss for each topic k , with a labeling prior probability  X  . As key-word label is the metadata of the corpus, so  X  can be easily obtained by observation. For example, suppose we have three keywords in corpus; we use these keywords as the topic X  X  labels, K = 3 ; paper d has keyword 1 and keyword 3 , so  X  = { 1 , 0 , 1 } , that will restrict  X  to be defined as  X  = {  X  1 , 0 , X  3 } , then all the topic assignments for d are exclusively limited to keyword 1 and keyword 3 .
To use this model, we need to analyze a multi-labeled sequen-tial scholarly publication collection (with keyword and publication date metadata) through posterior inference. This reveals a set of K dynamic changing topics and influence scores for each paper and each topic, which explicitly characterizes the "time-varying" dy-namics of publication content, and overcomes the problem of tra-ditional DIM. The detailed posterior inference is similar to DIM, which can be found in [8].

By pre-training the scholarly corpus using supervised document influence model, we can obtain three time-series distributions: (1) Time-series document-topic distributions ( TDTD ) publication ( 1  X  d m  X  | D i | ) published in time slice i ( 1  X  i  X  T ). TDTD represents the proportions of historical topics in papers published in a specific time slice. (2) Time-series topic-word distributions ( TTWD )
Where,  X  t i ,w n ,k is the probability of term w n ( 1  X  n  X  | V | ) appearing in k th topic ( 1  X  k  X  K ) in time slice i ( 1  X  i  X  T ). TTWD represents the relevance between terms and historical topics in a specific time slice. (3) Time-series document-topic influence distributions ( TDTL )
L = | D i | ) on k th topic ( 1  X  k  X  K ) published in time slice i ( 1  X  i  X  T  X  1 ). TDTL represents the publication X  X  influence on a historical topic in a specific time slice.

These three time-series topic-based distributions characterize the content dynamics on the topic level and will provide the dynamic topic-based information (dynamic topic mixture proportion, dy-namic topic evolution and dynamic topical influence) in chrono-logical citation recommendation. Unlike unsupervised approaches, these three distributions are more sparse and accurate. By using keyword metadata, we know the total number of topics, and we can observe if a keyword ever appears in a time slice. For instance, the keyword (topic) "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)" is first pro-posed in 2003; so the studies in the time slices prior to 2003 cannot
Although SDIM can be potentially helpful for chronological ci-tation recommendation by providing dynamic topic-based infor-mation, it also has two limitations for modeling the information-need shifting. First, SDIM doesn X  X  utilize citation information, and the citation relations can be very important to characterize the information-need shifting. Second, SDIM, along with the three dis-tributions, provides heterogeneous ranking information (features) which can hardly be represented as a unique ranking function. For instance, we can hardly propose a unique function to integrate topic inference, paper citation and topic evolution probabilities efficiently. To address these problems, we propose a heterogeneous graph min-ing approach where each kind of ranking information is conceptu-alized as a meta-path on the heterogeneous graph. The chronolog-ical citation recommendation with information-need shifting can then be estimated through learning-to-rank (by integrating different time-related meta-path based ranking features and feature weight training).

A heterogeneous graph, namely a heterogeneous information net-work, is a directed graph which contains multiple types of objects and links. In a heterogeneous graph, two different types of vertices can be connected via different paths that carry different types of information. A meta-path represents a composite relation over two vertices. For example, W  X  cons  X  T time r  X  P ? denotes a meta-path between a query word ( W  X  ) and a candidate cited paper ( P nected by a historical topic ( T time ) that has the word and is related to the paper. Sun et al. [22] give the formal definition of "Heteroge-neous information network," "Network schema" and "Meta-path."
We will construct a heterogeneous graph (Figure 3) with three types of vertices: (1) W , Word; (2) T time , Historical Topic (with topic label); and (3) P time , Paper published in specific time slice. The historical topic is time-slice dependent, which means even if different topics share the same keyword label, they are considered to be different topics if they belong to different time slices, i.e. Language model (2000) and Language model (2006) are two dif-ferent topics (two vertices on the graph) in this study.

The input of chronological citation recommendation is a piece of text to briefly summarize the information need, i.e., paper abstract or research idea description. We use two types of starting vertices on the graph to represent the user textual query: (1) W  X  in the query; and (2) T time  X  , the query-related historical topics generated via dynamic topic inference (LDA inference [2] for each time slice). Note that given the same query, as demonstrated in the last section, different time slices may have different query-related topic distributions based on TTWD .

The end vertex on the ranking meta-path is the candidate-cited paper, P time ? , in a specific time slice. The output is several lists of ranked candidate papers in different time slices, which could poten-tially be cited given the user X  X  query and reflect the user information-need shifting.

Table 1 presents the edges in the heterogeneous graph. Each edge carries one or more types of information, and it has its own weight. The sum of the weights (transitioning probability) of the edges of a specific type from the same vertex will be 1.
 (1) The weight of P i h  X  W n is the normalized TF-IDF value of
Figure 3: Constructed heterogeneous graph with textual query word n in paper i . (2) The weight of T k t i cons  X  W n is the probability  X  TTWD . tion probability 1 out outlinks of historical topic T m t i ;  X  T m t i is the normalization pa-rameter, which is the sum of all the weights of outlinks of historical topic T m t i ;  X  t i is the time decay factor, which ensures that the cita-tion from historical topic in recent time slice has more weight [24],  X  paper citation probability 1 out from TDTL (topic influenced by paper). (6) The weight of P m t i r  X  T k t i is the proportion  X  TDTD (paper related to topic). (7) The weight of T time cont  X  P time is the contribution of each paper to a historical topic (topic contributed by a paper). In or-der to estimate this contribution, we calculate the paper X  X  impor-algorithm [25]. The normalized topical PageRank authority score use a classical homogeneous graph where the vertex is a paper. The citation relationship between the vertices is utilized to calcu-late the PageRank authority scores. Each vertex is also charac-terized by a topic prior vector which is  X  t i ,d i The result of PageRank (with prior) is the historical topic authority ity vector Authority ( P m t i | T 1: K t j ) , the authority score of P P papers published in the year 2003 can be important for the his-torical topic, Information Retrieval (2006  X  2007) . Meanwhile, T former one is generated from content based dynamic topic model-ing, while the latter one comes from citation relations.

We use meta-path plus random walk from starting vertices to candidate paper vertices in the heterogeneous graph as the rank-ing functions. In order to quantify the ranking score of the candi-date paper vertices, we use random walk probability from starting (query) vertices to the target paper vertices following a meta-path: Where t is a tour from v (1) i to v ( l +1) j following the meta-path, and RW ( t ) is the simulated random walk probability of the tour t . Sup-then, p ( v ( j ) ij ) is the vertex prior probability. Note that we don X  X  consider the direction of edges when we calculate the simulated random walk probability.

For example, given meta-path W  X  h  X  P ? , the relevance score from W n  X  to P m,time ? can be calculated by p ( W n  X  )  X  w ( W P m,time ? ) , where p ( W n  X  ) is the normalized TF-IDF value of W in query and w ( W n  X  h  X  P m,time ? ) is the weight of edge which is the normalized TF-IDF value of W n in candidate paper P m,time
The total ranking score from a set of starting vertices to a candi-date paper X  X  vertex can be defined as:
All meta-paths investigated in this study are listed in Table 2. All these meta-paths address different ranking hypotheses, and each meta-path carries one or more types of dynamic ranking informa-tion. We use these meta-paths as chronological ranking features, and the total ranking score of a publication for a specific meta-path is the ranking feature value for this publication. By constructing and calculating all these time-related meta-path based ranking fea-tures, we achieve the first level modeling of information-need shift-ing for chronological citation recommendation.
After obtaining the different dynamic ranking features, it X  X  vi-tal to characterize information-need shifting. In this study, we use learning-to-rank to integrate all the ranking features for each time slice and estimate the evolving feature weights in different time slices. As mentioned in section 1, user information need can vary in different time slices (information-need shifting). We train multi-ranking models, {  X  1 ,  X  2 ...  X  T } (total T time slices), for different time slices. The information need in time slice t can be charac-terized as:  X  t  X  = L ( &lt; 1 ,t , &lt; 2 ,t ,  X  X  X  , &lt; candidate cited paper recommendation ranking in time slice t , and &lt; c,t represents the recommendation score for paper c published in time slice t . Each candidate paper is assigned different rank-ing scores via various meta-paths. We also assume the importance (feature weight) of different ranking features can be significantly different for different time slices. In this study, &lt; by: given that n is the number of ranking features;  X  t i is the weight for ranking feature i , it should be time evolving; Q q is the starting vertices from the user initial textual query; v c t is the candidate pub-score for meta-path i .

We estimate the effect of information-need shifting by evaluat-ing the recommendation performance for different historical pe-riods. Following this strategy, we use learning-to-rank to train the time-evolving  X  t i for ranking feature i in time slice t to opti-mize the recommendation performance. Learning-to-rank [12] op-timizes ranking performance using machine learning techniques. In the learning-to-rank framework, documents are usually represented by ranking feature vectors. We use learning-to-rank to combine dif-ferent meta-path based ranking features and model the information-need shifting while avoiding manual parameter tuning. Specifi-cally, we train the ranking models by using a list-wise algorithm (Coordinate Ascent [16]) on the training data. A training metric (nDCG@k or MAP@k) needs to be applied, and the model that performs best is recorded for each time slice. Because nDCG is more sensitive on the order of the recommendation results  X  espe-cially the top recommendation orders  X  compared with MAP, we choose nDCG@k as a training metric. We use a scientific candi-date publication set and a set of testing paper for training and eval-uation. The abstracts of testing papers are used as the experiment query, and the (author-provided) reference lists are employed as the judgment data. The cite time of different cited papers indicates the importance of each cited paper (for nDCG relevance score). A more detailed evaluation setting will be addressed in the experi-ment section. After training is complete, we evaluate the trained models on the test data in an evaluation metric (nDCG@k). N-fold cross-validation will be used in this study. Coordinate Ascent is a relatively simple algorithm which iteratively optimizes a multivari-ate objective ranking function for meta-path feature integration and algorithm evaluation. A more detailed algorithm description can be found in [16]. Citation Recommendation and Citation Relationship
Scientific recommendation occurs when a scientific publication, venue, or author is recommended to users based on the similarity between the recommended resource and user profiles or samples of in-progress text. Similar to previous studies in text information re-trieval and text mining, a number of studies employed text similar-ity approaches, such as paper/author content matching [3,4,6,9,10] and unsupervised topic modeling [1, 14, 26].

Scholarly or bibliographic networks, i.e., networks based on ci-tation or co-authorship, are another important approach that has been used to recommend scientific resources. For instance, Shi, Leskovec, and McFarland [19] developed citation projection graphs by investigating citations among publications cited by a given pa-per. Unsupervised topic modeling was also used for citation anal-ysis [26] where visible candidate citations, hidden scientific top-ics, and visible words were represented in different layers. A re-stricted Boltzmann machine model was used for building the re-lationship between user input and recommended citation ranking. In this study, we employed citation importance decay, which was similar to CiteRank [24] (an enhanced ranking algorithm compared to PageRank), which enabled the ranking method to estimate the traffic T i (  X  dir , X  ) to a given paper i . For this method, a recent paper was more likely to be selected with a probability that was exponentially discounted according to the age of the paper,  X  at every step of the path, with probability  X  that the researcher was satisfied/saturated and halted his/her line of inquiry. Dietz et. al X  X  citation Influence Model [5] was another effective method of weighing the importance of a citation relation which employed cit-ing and cited paper topic distribution, and the compatibility-based citation weighting of two topic mixtures as measured by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Based on these works, Nallapati et. al. [17] proposed Pairwise-Link-LDA and Link-PLSA-LDA whose goal was to predict important unseen citation between papers by using topic-based graph models.

To the best of our knowledge, few existing studies have inves-tigated the chronological citation recommendation problem. Intu-itively, for citation recommendation, user information should shift for different time slices. In this study, we will address this problem. Dynamic Topic Modeling
Topic dynamics has been recently investigated. Laura Dietz et al. [5], for example, devised a probabilistic topic model that ex-plains the generation of documents. The model incorporates the aspects of topical innovation and topical inheritance via citations. Blei and Lafferty [1] proposed a dynamic topic model (DTM), which explicitly characterized the chronological nature of sequen-tial corpora by utilizing a Markov chain of term distributions over time along with multiple LDA-based topic distributions. Based on [1], Gerrish and Blei proposed the document influence model (DIM) [8]. This model respected the ordering of the documents and not only tracked how underlying theme has changed over time, but also captured how past articles exhibit varying influence on future articles. Unfortunately, both DTM and DIM may not be an appro-priate solution for the citation recommendation task for three rea-sons. First, given a textual information need, DTM or DIM alone cannot discover optimized dynamic topic chains in terms of user textual information needs. Second, scientific publications are inter-linked by citation, which contains important information. DTM or DIM, however, assumes documents are independent of each other, and the number of topics, as other unsupervised LDA approaches, are not given. Liu et al., [14] found that the unsupervised LDA ap-proach is not ideal for scientific publications, and scientific meta-data, i.e., author assigned keywords, should be used to enhance the topic modeling performance.

In order to solve this problem, we utilized Labeled-LDA (LLDA) [18], which used corpus metadata, i.e., keywords and categories, to enhance the topic modeling process and constrained topic models by defining a one-to-one correspondence between latent topics and labels which solved the problems of topic number setting and topic interpretability. We proposed our work based on DIM, and added supervised technology into DIM by combining LLDA.
 Heterogeneous Graph Mining
The concept of meta-path was first proposed in [22], which could systematically capture the semantic relation between objects in a heterogeneous information network scenario. Different meta-path-based mining tasks were studied, including similarity search [22], relationship prediction [20, 21], user-guided clustering [23], and recommendation [13]. It turned out the meta-path served as a very critical feature extraction tool for most of the mining tasks in a het-erogeneous information network. In this paper, we employed meta-path-based approach as the ranking features, which were extracted from an innovative, dynamic scholarly heterogeneous network.
More recently, Lao and Cohen [11] used both supervised and unsupervised methods with the Random Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm for citation, author, and venue recommendation. A sim-ilar approach was also used by [13]. It had been demonstrated that by using the heterogeneous link information in a network, mining functions, such as similarity search, ranking, clustering and classi-fication could be significantly enhanced [27]. In this section, we describe the experimental setting and results. Detailed analysis and conclusions are presented in the next section.
We extracted 45,372 publications with 107,691 citation relations from 6,818 journals and 4,455 conference proceedings or work-shops on computer science between 1951 and 2011 (from the ACM digital library ). We used the title and the abstract information to represent the content of the paper. All the selected papers X  con-tents featured more than 80 words after removing stop words and stemming each term to its root. The vocabulary size was 6,517. The most frequent 5% of terms and words occurring fewer than 15 times were removed. Author-provided keywords were used as topic labels for SDIM training. The initial number of labels was 1,082, regardless of time slice, and the total historical topic number was 8,072. To verify and compare different recommendation algo-rithms, we split the corpus into eight time slices: pre-1990, 1990-1999, 2000-2002, 2003-2005, 2006-2007, 2008-2009, the year 2010 and the year 2011 . Each time slice contained a similar number of papers. We generated 2,957,476 paper-has-word relations, 107,691 paper-cite-paper relations, 2,242,547 historical-topic-cite-historical-topic relations. After pre-training, we also found 165,970 historical-topic-influenced-by-paper relations, 174,009 paper-related-to-hist-orical-topic relations, 2,171,771 historical-topic-consist-of-word re-lations (the top 300 words were kept). We then ran PageRank with historical topic prior and generated 1,634,365 historical-topic-contributed-by-paper relations (top 250 papers were kept).
For citation recommendation evaluation, we used a test collec-tion of 274 papers. The selected papers met the following condi-tions: (1) the selected papers were excluded from the 45,372 pub-lication candidate citation collection; (2) each selected paper fea-tured more than 15 citations to the candidate citation collection, and (3) each paper X  X  abstract featured at least 150 words. The abstract was used as a working context to represent information need, and we recommended citations from the candidate citation collection. In this research, we used an importance score, ranging from 0-4, as the candidate cited paper importance to calculate nDCG scores. For example, if a candidate cited paper was not cited by the target test-ing paper, the importance score was 0. If a citation was cited four or more times in the citing paper, then it was probably very impor-tant for the target citing publication, and its importance score was 4. Each testing paper X  X  citations were partitioned into eight time slices according to the cited paper X  X  publication date. By evaluat-ing the recommendation performance in different time slices, we could estimate the effect of information-need shifting.

We then provided a set of ranked recommendation lists for chrono-logical citation recommendation by learning-to-rank training and evaluation for different time slices. However, as the citation data for the two most recent time slices (year 2010 and 2011) were too sparse (total valid citations were fewer than 10), we only trained and evaluated the recommendation model for the first six time slices (until year 2009).
In the experiment, we used the proposed meta-path as the rank-ing feature for chronological citation recommendation. Meanwhile, we needed to employ the baseline feature groups for comparison. However, chronological citation recommendation and information-need shifting is a newly proposed problem, and few existing al-gorithms address this problem. We chose five classic models as baseline feature groups. These models were widely used in prac-tice and had proven to be very effective scholarly recommendation methods. Particularly, as chronological citation recommendation is designed for time-series citation recommendation, we need to com-pare it with other time-related algorithms. As mentioned in section 3, CiteRank [24] is an enhanced ranking algorithm based on PageR-ank, which is designed for citation network with time information. The baselines are listed as follows: 1. PageRank : Applied the classical PageRank algorithm in pa-per citation network (query independent). 2. CiteRank : Applied the CiteRank algorithm [24] in paper citation network with the default parameters (  X  = 0 . 50 , X  2 . 6 years [24]). This baseline is also query independent. 3.

For each baseline algorithm, we first generated the whole ranked paper list (time slice independent), then partitioned the list into a set of sub-lists based on the publication year.

As Table 3 shows, different features perform differently. There are two meta-path based features (Meta-Path 2 and 20, bold in the table) that outperform all the baseline algorithms with averaged MAP of all time slices. Meanwhile, there are three meta-path based features (Meta-Path 2, 20 and 21, bold in the table) that outperform all the baseline algorithms with averaged nDCG of all time slices. However, Table 3 only indicates the averaged performance. In fact, even the best-performing ranking feature cannot always outperform the baseline algorithms in each time slice. For instance, Meta-Path 2 achieves the best averaged nDCG@10, but in the pre-1990 time slice, its ranking performance (nDCG@10 = 0.0927) is worse than PageRank X  X  performance (nDCG@10 = 0.1279). In next step, the chronological citation recommendation method used learning-to-rank to integrate all the ranking features and trained the time-evolving model to enhance the recommendation performance. Note that each meta-path generates a ranking feature, and low perfor-mance features are not necessarily useless from a learning-to-rank perspective. Instead, some ranking features can be very useful if they can provide a distinct or novel ranking contribution [7].
For Chronological Citation Recommendation, all the meta-paths proposed in Table 2 were used as features via learning-to-rank. To avoid evaluation bias, we applied five-fold cross-validation for each time slice. Specifically, for each time slice, we trained a Coordi-nate Ascent model on each fold that optimizes for nDCG@10; this model was evaluated on the corresponding test data for the current fold also using nDCG@10. The dynamic ranking feature weight for each time slice was the average value of 5-fold cross-validation learn-to-rank training results for this time slice.

As Figure 4 shows, the result of chronological citation recom-mendation (CCR) method is promising. We chose top two best meta-path based ranking features for averaged nDCG evaluation result of all time slices (Meta-Path 2 and 20) and five baseline al-gorithms for comparison. The chronological citation recommen-dation model achieves the best performance with all the average nDCG evaluation metrics (t-test, p &lt; 0 . 005 ).

In different time slices, the chronological citation recommen-dation (CCR) model still achieved the best performance with all nDCG evaluation metrics (nDCG@10 -nDCG@100), except one Figure 4: The Average nDCG Performance of final rankings using Chronological Citation Recommendation metric (nDCG@50 for time slice of "2003-2005"). For this met-ric, CiteRank(nDCG@50 = 0.0237) outperforms CCR(nDCG@50 = 0.0213). In Figure 5, we present the nDCG@10 performance of chronological citation recommendation (CCR) model in different time slices comparing baseline algorithms.

Each ranking feature received a time-evolving weight from the learning-to-ranking training, and the weight represented the rank-ing feature X  X  contribution to the recommendation performance in a specific time slice. As Figure 6 shows, we present the weight evolu-tion of four meta-path features in different time slices. The orange dotted line represents the linear trend line. These four meta-paths carry different types of information. Meta-Path 1 (carrying word-based information) and Meta-Path 4 (carrying dynamic topic-based information) weights (contribution) are increasing from the oldest time slice to the newest time slice. Meta-Path 9 (carrying time-decay paper citation information and dynamic topic-based infor-mation) and Meta-Path 12 (carrying time-decay topic citation in-formation and dynamic topic-based information) weights, on the contrary, contribute less to the newer time slices. We can general-ize from this finding that: with the citation density getting lower in recent time slices, the content-based ranking features (word or topic) are increasingly important in recommending recent publica-tions, while citation-based features are more important for recom-mending historical publications. We can also find that the absolute values of different ranking features are varying significantly. For instance, compared with the Meta-Path 4 (dynamic topic-based in-formation) feature, the Meta-Path 1 (word-based information) fea-ture is a "stronger" feature, which means Meta-Path 1 feature will provide more contribution in chronological citation recommenda-tion along with information-need shifting.
In this study we propose "Chronological Citation Recommenda-tion," which addresses the requirement of characterizing "informat-ion-need shifting." We characterize the information-need shifting with two-level modeling: (1) dynamic time-related ranking feature construction with supervised dynamic document influence model training, and meta-path-based ranking features on a novel hetero-geneous graph along with random walk algorithm; (2) dynamic evolving feature weight training by applying learning-to-rank to train multi-ranking models in different time slices for optimizing the chronological citation recommendation performance. Exper-iment results with multi-labeled ACM sequential data show that the new method can significantly enhance the citation recommen-dation performance in different time slices. This result supports our hypothesis and demonstrates that chronological citation rec-ommendation improves time-series citation recommendation per-formance compared to general paper ranking using classic models and time-related algorithms. In other words, the result proves that, given a textual query, the new method can better characterize the information-need shifting in different time slices and give better time-series recommendation lists.

In this study, different meta-paths reflect different ranking hy-potheses. Whether they carry the same type of information or the information is totally different, the ranking performance differs. For instance, as Table 2 and Table 3 show, although Meta-Path 8 and Meta-Path 9 both contain time-decay paper citation informa-tion and dynamic topic-based information, the hypotheses are dif-ferent, and the ranking performances are wide apart. Experiment also shows that in all the ranking features  X  Meta-Path 2, carrying word-based information, and time-decay paper citation information  X  achieves the best ranking performance with all averaged MAP evaluation metrics, averaged nDCG@10 and nDCG@100. Other well-performing meta-path rankings, such as Meta-Path 20 and 21, also contain these two types of information. In contrast, the rank-ings of meta-paths which only contain dynamic topic-based infor-mation or time-decay topic citation information, such as Meta-Path 3, 4, 6, 7, 12 and 13, perform less effectively in the experiment. These results demonstrate the importance of word-based informa-tion and time-decay paper citation information. They are indis-pensable in chronological citation recommendation and modeling the information-need shifting.

The chronological citation recommendation model in each time slice is a learned model via learning-to-rank, which contains all types of information and combines all the feature information op-timally by training the feature weight in different time slices. Its ranking performance is promising. As Figure 4 and Figure 5 show, the chronological citation recommendation achieves the best in all time slices. Moreover, the chronological citation recommendation ranking in each time slice is most stable when compared with base-line algorithms. As Figure 6 shows, the feature weight is evolving over time. It not only reflects the different contributions of different time-related ranking features, but also captures the ranking feature time-evolving trajectory. These results indicate the new method can probably address the information-need shifting problem and enhance the citation recommendation performance.

The methodological limitations of this work are twofold. First, after splitting into different time slices, the citations of the test cor-pus were sparse in several time slices. More evaluation and model training methods should be applied in future work. Second, the ti-tle and abstract (along with pruning) limits experiment vocabulary to a relatively small set. More sophisticated text features could be extracted from full text data.

In future work, we will validate chronological citation recom-mendation in other multi-labeled sequential datasets, i.e., PubMed, and create more sophisticated learning-to-rank algorithms for char-acterizing information-need shifting.
