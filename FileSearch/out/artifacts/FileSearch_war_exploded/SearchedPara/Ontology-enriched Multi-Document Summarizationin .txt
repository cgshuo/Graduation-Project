 In this poster, we propose a novel document summariza-tion approach named O ntology-enriched M ulti-Document S ummarization( OMS ) for utilizing background knowledge to improve summarization results. OMS first maps the sen-tences of input documents onto an ontology, then links the given query to a specific node in the ontology, and finally ex-tracts the summary from the sentences in the subtree rooted at the query node. By using the domain-related ontology, OMS can better capture the semantic relevance between the query and the sentences, and thus lead to better summariza-tion results. As a byproduct, the final summary generated by OMS can be represented as a tree showing the hierar-chical relationships of the extracted sentences. Evaluation results on the collection of press releases by Miami-Dade County Department of Emergency Management during Hur-ricane Wilma in 2005 demonstrate the efficacy of OMS .

Ontology is a philosophy concept, dealing with questions about what entities exist or can be said to exist, and how such entities can be grouped within a hierarchy, and sub-divided according to their similarities and differences. On-tology has been applied in many research areas in informa-tion retrieval, particularly, in text mining. For example, D. S  X   X  nchez et al use the ontology to compute semantic sim-ilarity [1], and I. Yoo et al utilize the ontology to improve document clustering [2]. However, relatively few research ef-forts have been reported on using the ontology for improving document summarization.

Generally, given a query, multi-document summarization is the process of generating a query-focused/relevant conden-sation (i.e., a generated summary) of the content of the en-tire input set. Existing summarization methods usually rank the sentences in the documents according to their scores calculated by a set of predefined features, such as term frequency-inverse sentence frequency (TF-ISF), sentence or term position, and number of keywords [3]. The above anal-yses are difficult to capture the hidden semantic relation-ships between the sentences and queries. Ontology, with abundant concise concepts and rich domain-related infor-mation, can capture the hidden semantic information.
In this poster, we develop a novel method, OMS , to gener-ate query-relevant summary from a collection of documents by making use of the ontology. In particular, OMS first links the sentences of documents being considered onto a domain-related ontology, then maps the given query to a specific node in the ontology, and finally extracts the sum-mary from the sentences in the subtree rooted at the corre-sponding query node, by using FGB, a text summarization approach described in [4]. As a byproduct, the summaries we finally acquire can be represented as a tree showing the hierarchical relationships of the extracted sentences. We apply OMS to disaster management for evaluation. For natural calamities, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, vast amount of related news and reports are generated through time for broadcasting and recording events. Experimental results on such disaster management demonstrate the effi-cacy of OMS .
Figure 1 shows the framework of OMS . First of all, a do-main specific ontology hierarchy was created by domain ex-perts to describe concepts appearing in disaster related doc-ument sets. Given a collection of documents related to dis-asters, we disassemble them into a set of sentences. Then we map these sentences onto the ontology hierarchy based on their semantic correlations, discarding some sentences not relevant to any concept in the ontology, and omitting from the ontology some concepts with less importance.
Up to this point, we obtain an ontology-sentence tree rep-resentation in which each node is linked by a set of relevant sentences. Given a query q , OMS links it to a specific node i in the ontology-sentence tree according to the semantic relationship between the query and the nodes, and extracts a sub-hierarchy rooted at i . Then the FGB model [4] is applied to summarize sentences linked to each node in this subtree. Finally, a summary tree that satisfies the query q is achieved.

Ontology Refinement: In the ontology hierarchy, a myriad of concepts relevant to disaster management doc-uments are specified by domain experts. Given a subset of documents, some concepts may not be predominant or even not appear in this documents set. We need to refine the ontology hierarchy so that the ontology-sentence tree repre-sentation can better reflect the subject of the document set. To do so, we first rank nodes at the same level in order of sentence counts, then ignore the nodes and their subtrees with sentence counts less than the average. By iteratively running the above procedure in a top-down manner, a the-matic ontology-sentence tree representation is generated.
The document set used in our experiments is a collec-tion of press releases from Miami-Dade County Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security during Hurricane Wilma from Oct. 19, 2005 to Nov. 4, 2005. It contains approximately 1,700 documents, about half of which contain similar contents. We randomly select 100 doc-uments from this document set as our experiment data.
Data Preprocessing: For the sake of the theme embod-iment of ontology-sentence tree representation, some sen-tences are removed from the whole sentences set in the pro-cedure of sentence mapping, since they have no semantic relationship with any ontology concept node. For example,  X  X or those outside of Miami Dade County can call (305) 468-5900 to reach the Answer Center. X  X escribes the phone num-ber of the Answer Center; however, this kind of sentences repeatedly appears in most disaster related documents we are considering, and they have no specific meaning for sum-marization.
In order to illustrate the interpretability of our proposed method, we provide an example of queries and the corre-sponding result generated by OMS . Figure 2 demonstrates this case study.

Given the query  X  X et all the information related to transit in Miami-Dade County after Hurricane Wilma passed X , the result is represented as a summary tree in Figure 2, in which the topics in eclipses are domain concepts, and the sentences linked to them are summaries correlating to concepts. We observe that (1) every summary in the summary tree con-cretely reflects the status of relevant concept; (2) summaries generated by OMS exhibit apparent semantic hierarchy.
For performance evaluation, 42 queries related to some specific concepts in the ontology are designed by domain ex-perts for experimentation. In order to evaluate the quality of the generated summaries by OMS and other methods, we use human generated summaries as references. For hurricane data, we hire 5 human labelers to manually create summaries based on the selected document set and the given queries. Then we run OMS on such document set; meanwhile, we apply FGB [4] to automatically summarize query-relevant documents without using ontology. The summarization re-sults are evaluated by ROUGE, a document summarization evaluation tool described in [5]. The experiment results are shown in Table 1. The results indicate that summarization efficacy is significantly improved by adopting ontology. Table 1: Summarization results comparison be-tween OMS and FBG without using ontology. Re-mark: We use ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-S and ROUGE-SU, and compare F-scores of the two different methods.
