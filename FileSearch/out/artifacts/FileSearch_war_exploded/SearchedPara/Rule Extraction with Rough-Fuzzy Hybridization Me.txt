 with incomplete and inconsistent information, and manipulates various levels of data representation. However, soft computing techniques are based on quite strong as-sumptions. They cannot derive conclusions from incomplete knowledge, or manage deal with vague concepts and to represent ambiguity, vagueness and uncertainty. 
Rough set algorithms [1] do not need membership functions and prior parameter techniques. Decision rules extracted by rough set are concise and valuable, which can limitation of traditional rough set theory is concerned with discrete data; quantitative set [2-6]. By these approaches, the comparison among objects turned from elements X  equivalence relation. This study concentrates on automatically extracting the relevant depicted in Fig. 1, a four-stage rough-fuzzy hybridization proc-ess for learning fuzzy if-then rules in datasets was proposed. 
The rest of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the analytical method-ology of this study, and gives an overview of the linguistic sum-marization of databases and its application in extracting fuzzy if-then rules. Section 3 describes in detail the proposed rough-fuzzy hybridization method in con-structing fuzzy rule-base, and shows an example of the ability to extract fuzzy if-then rules in a fuzzy database exhibiting lin-guistic summaries. The final section draws conclusions. 2.1 The Experimental Dataset The experimental dataset used in this study is a breast cancer diagnosis database ob-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/. The Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer (WDBC) and accurate classification rules in a trained neural network. Tan et al. [8] proposed a to be applied in clinical practice for better understanding and prevention of unwanted medical events. Chou et al. [9] used neural network and MARS techniques to discover the breast cancer pattern. 2.2 Automatically Transform Quantitative Data Values Into Linguistic Terms sharp divide quantitative values into intervals. However, the sharp division of quantita-domain. A self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm was used to obtain k midpoints of the guistic representation technique, each attribute domain was characterized as a trapezoi-closely than the linguistic meaning of quantitative data. Moreover, the extracted fuzzy if-then rules can be represented the learned knowledge in terms of human thinking, and tolerated imprecise information more robustly. { m 1 , m 2 ,..., m k } denote the k midpoints obtained by the SOM algorithm. Using these k trapezoidal fuzzy set. The first me mbership function is computed as: jects in the universal of discourse drawn together by the indistinguishability relation. ample, the trapezoidal fuzzy set {( Low,0.8), (Medium,0.6), (High,0.3)} is binalized as  X 100 X , then the binalized objects are processed by Rough Sets. 2.3 Using Fuzzy Truth Value to Evalua te the Confidence of Fuzzy if-Then Rules As stated by Yager [10], the linguistic summary is a linguistically quantified proposition containing meta-knowledge about a set of particular objects, and is useful in knowledge discovery. This study aims to consider the notable subsets of tuples in the medical data-labels describing each subset of tuples. Thus, for each notable linguistic summary  X  Q X X and S with respect to the quantifier, Q . 
The fuzzy logic based calculus provides the interpreting and validating of the truth statement involving complex linguistic quantifiers, such as  X  X any X ,  X  X ome X  and { t ,..., t n } denotes a set of fuzzy tuples in the medical dataset, DB . The procedure for determining the truth value of a linguistically quantified statement is as follows. If the then the membership value of t i to S is given by: function (,)0  X  X  X  = X   X  if and only if (()0) procedure in obtaining the truth value of the linguistic summaries. fuzzy if-then rules generated by the proposed rough-fuzzy hybridization process. Suitable linguistic quantifier can be employed to interpret linguistic confidence. ID IF THEN Support Accuracy This study proposes a rough-fuzzy hybridization method for learning informative and concise fuzzy if-then rules from examples. The quantitative/categorical inter-face provided by fuzzy set theory is used for the linguistic representation of exam-ples, and balances the expert perception and system automation. Besides, the re-ducts provided by rough set theory were found to be a useful tool for finding candi-Moreover, this study proposed to use fuzzy truth value to evaluate the confidence of fuzzy if-then rules.
