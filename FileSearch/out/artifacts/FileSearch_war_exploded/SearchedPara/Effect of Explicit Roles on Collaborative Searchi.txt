 Collaborative search can be seen as an activity where a group of people carry out search for shared goals [3]. According to a survey [6], collaborative search is often conducted in professional context such as academic literature survey, but also in personal context such as travel planning. As people X  X  information seeking tasks increases its complexity, they ar e more likely to pursue a collaboration to complete the problems [11]. However, collaborative search itself can be more complex than single-person search which has been a main assumption made in existing Information Ret rieval (IR) research.

This paper presents a user study investigating effects of explicit roles on collab-orative search. Taking a role is a typica l and effective way to perform a complex task [5]. Roles have an effect of labour division in group activities, clarifying individual contributions to the goal, and increasing awareness during collabo-ration [2], and thus, it is an important research agenda in collaborative search. Algorithmic support for different roles has been suggested [10], but behavioural analysis of role-based collaborative information seeking has been limited. There-fore, our main research question was t o examine effects of explicit human roles on collaborative search tasks.

We chose travel planning as our evaluation task for several reasons. First, it is one of the most popular motivations for people to perform collaborative search [6]. Second, finding travel information (e.g., transportations, accommodations, visiting places) and organising them into a single plan is a fairly complex task. Finally, travel planning is a fun and familiar task, and thus, we can expect a high level of user commitment to the ta sk which is an important element in interactive IR studies. However, along the way of our investigation, it became clear that we needed to develop a fair part of evaluation methodology for a task-based evaluation of collaborative search. More specifically, we devised a set of dependent variables for travel planning tasks. Therefore, this paper should also be seen as a report of an exercise that con sidered various aspects of experiments when travel planing was used as an evaluation task in collaborative search.
The rest of this paper is structured as fo llows. Section 2 describes the experi-mental design we devised to examine effect s of explicit roles. Section 3 presents the results of our experiment. Finally, Section 4 discusses the implications of our main findings to conclude the paper. This section presents the user study designed to examine effects of explicit roles on collaborative search task. 2.1 Travel Planning Task As discussed earlier, travel planning task is a frequent collaborative search task with a high level of complexity and familiarity. A set of task conditions was devised to ensure its complexity and to facilitate user engagement in the exper-iment. One, a travel plan was for five to seven days where the main destinations were abroad. Two, a pair had to agree on decisions made during the task. Three, it was not allowed to take a package tour which covered most of the plan (but a short guided tours were allowed). Four, the plan should have place names (to visit, eat, or stay), transportation methods and their schedule and costs, and any activities. Fifth, the upper limit of the travel cost was set to 5,000 USD per person. We set a relatively high budget to encourage participant pairs to consider a wide range of opportunities during the task.

Participants were given 90 minutes to complete the task. However, since task completion time was not our main concern in this study, we gave extra time when participant pairs asked. Some pairs asked for few minutes extra time to wrap up the planning. No noticeable differen ce of average task completion time was found between two conditions, which will be described in the following section. 2.2 Independent Variable Our research question looks at the eff ect of explicit roles assigned to a group member on their collaborative information seeking behaviour. Therefore, our independent variable is the presence (or absence) of explicit instruction to divide the roles during the travel planning task. The instruction of role division was given to participant pairs as a part of the description of travel planning task. In our task, all members involved in trav el planning. However, the instruction explicitly asked a pair to take roles of a searcher and writer .Thesearcherrole operates a PC to gather information needed to make a travel plan, while the writer role takes notes and write down tr avel information on a given sheet. This role assignment has been shown to be eff ective in solving a complex task [5]. Other types of role models were left for future work. Participant pairs were asked to decided the role in advance, but they were allowed to swap the role anytime during the task. Another difference between the two conditions was the number of PCs. Two laptops (one for each) were used by the pairs who were given no specific role instruction, while only one laptop (for searcher) was used by those who were given the explicit role instruction. This was to ensure that assigned roles were taken place in the latter. 12 participant pairs were given the task description with the explicit role division while the other 12 participant pairs were given the task description without the explicit role division. 2.3 Dependent Variables The effect of explicit roles on collaborative information seeking behaviour was measured at different levels, which are described below.
 Executability of travel plan. The first question raised in our experimental design was  X  X hat was a good travel plan? X . This was not trivial to answer. Existing work [7,9] which used travel planning as an evaluation task did not either ask participants to make a travel plan or make careful consideration on a performance of travel plan as dependent variables. There are some performance measures of travel plans [8] in the context of workplace, and are not necessar-ily applicable to our experimental design. After a series of discussion among the authors, we decided to employ the concept of executability as a performance measure of travel plans. The assumption here was that a good travel plan should define necessary information to complete a trip. The necessary information in-cludes the name of places to visit, accommodation to stay, restaurant to eat, transfer methods (e.g., air plane, train, bus, taxi, walk), time of transportation if used, and the cost. Although a real tra vel plan is likely to have uncertainty in these aspects for a good reason, we defined that more travel information was defined the better the plan was.
 Search actions and subjective assessments The next two groups of dependent variables were common to int eractive IR studies. Search actions include the number of queries submitted to search engines and other web sites, number of web pages visited, and domains. These objective vari-ables specifically looked at search efforts made by participants to com-plete the task. Search behaviour wh ich recorded by the QT-Honey system ( http://cres.jpn.org/?QT-Honey ). QT-Honey is an extension of the Lemur Query Log Toolbar ( http://www.lemurproject.org/querylogtoolbar/ ) which works as a Firefox add-on to reco rd action events detected on the web browser. Subjective assessments, on the other hand, measures how participants perceived various aspects of the travel planning tasks. This study asked many questions but will report the perception s about task completion, satisfaction, and other general feedback on collaborative tasks.
 Development of dialogues. The last category of dependent variables was a level of dialogue development between te am members. Our objectives of analysing dialogue data were to gain insight into the verbal communication during the task. While it has been suggested that investigating relevant information or knowl-edge shared by team members is an important aspect of collaborative informa-tion seeking and retrieval [3], little s tudy has been carried out to examine the verbal communication. In our study, participant pairs conversations were video-recorded and the dialogue data were coded by a variant of a scheme proposed by Chan, et al. [1]. A brief description of the dialogue development levels are as follows. Level 1 is an utterance regarding participant X  X  experience or its general-isation. Level 2 is regarding clarification of term X  X  definition or its explanation. Level 3 is regarding confirmation of a gro up member X  X  opinion or perspective. Level 4 is regarding awareness and formulation of a problem to solve. Finally, Level 5 is regarding presentation of an idea or suggestion about the problem recognised during the task. A summary of the dialogue development model is shown in Table 1 along with sample conversations. The scheme allowed us to measure a level of dialogue development between team members. Due to lack of resources, we were only able to code the first 10 minutes, middle 10 minutes, and last 10 minutes of the task. The coding was performed by one of the authors, and when necessarily, the authors jointly coded ambiguous cases. 2.4 Participants Participants were recruited as a pair to ensure comfortable communication and collaboration during the task. Recruitment was carried out by multiple channels such as mailing lists, notice board, and word-of-month in our university. As a result, 24 pairs (48 people) participat ed the experiment. The entry sheet estab-lished that all participants were either undergraduate or postgraduate students in our university. Their academic major s ranged from Pure Sci ence, Informatics, to Social Science, Arts and Humanities. Of 24 pairs, 12 pairs (50%) had known each other for over 3 years, 8 pairs (33%) for over 1.5 years, and 4 pairs (17%) for less than 6 months. Participants had on average 7.5 years (SD: 2.3) of search experience on the Web and frequent users of search engines. 11 pairs (46%) had had a collaborative search task with the pair member at least once. In sum-mary, our participants were frequent search engine users with various academic background although they were all university students. All pairs had a friendly relationship which helped to perform a collaborative task in the experiment. 2.5 Procedure The whole session took approximately two hours per participated team. Par-ticipants were rewarded with 10 USD per an hour of work. The procedure of the user study was as follows. 1) Welcoming a pair and asked them to read Information Sheet which described the aim of the experiment and participat-ing conditions; 2) Asked the pair to sign Agreement Form; 3) Asked the pair to fill Entry Questionnaire individually to collect demographic information and search experience; 4) Asked the pair to read the task instruction (with/without explicit role division) along with an example travel planning sheet; 5) Asked the pair to perform the travel planning task for 90 minutes, writing their plan on a blank sheet; 6) When the task completed, we asked the pair to fill in Task Questionnaire individually to capture their subjective assessments on the task; and finally, 7) Asked the pair to fill in Exit Questionnaire individually to capture an overall feedback on collaboration and e xperiment. Pilot tests were carried out with three pairs to verify and adjust the experimental conditions prior to the final experiments whose results will be presented in the next section. This section presents the results of the experiments. We use the notation of ER group to denote the pairs who were given an explicit role instruction while NR group to denote those who wer e given no role instruction. 3.1 Travel Plans The first investigation looked into the travel plans generated by participant pairs as the outcome of the task. Since participants were asked to write a travel plan in a free format, the generated schedul e was first converted to a simple graph model where a node represented a place and edge represented a path between the places. The following analyses we re based on the converted models.
The first analysis on the travel plans counted the number of places identified in the sheet. The types of places counted w ere transportation stops (airports, train stations, bus stops), accommodations, and places to sightsee. In addition, participants sometimes formulated only a vague idea about the places to sightsee, and wrote a description like  X  X omewher e to go X  tentatively. We counted these cases as undecided in the analysis. Finally, some pairs chose to take a local tour as a part of plan. This was also included in the analysis. The average number of places identified in the travel plans was 17.3 (Standard Deviation: 5.1) in the ER group and 18.3 (SD: 7.2) in the NR group. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that the difference was not significant ( p  X  . 862). Figure 1 shows the distribution of the places in the ER and NR groups. As can be seen, the EP group tended to have a higher proportion of transportation stops and accommodation than the NR group, while the NR group tended to have a higher proportion of places to sightsee than the ER group. The NR group also tended to have a higher proportion of undecided places than the ER group.

The next analysis looked at the travel methods participants planed to used for moving between the places. We categoris ed the travel methods into six groups, namely, walking, buses, trains, flights, taxies, and others. The average percentage of the travel methods is shown in Figure 2. As can be seen, the most frequent travel methods identified in the plans was flights in both groups. A relatively large difference was observed in the use of buses, trains, and taxies. In particular, the use of buses was very rare in the ER group, while the NR group had a similar percentage of all travel methods except flights.

The last analysis on the travel plans investigated the amount of travel in-formation written in the sheet. More sp ecifically, we counted the number of information about time (schedule) and costs of travel. In the ER group, 38.6% (SD: 14.6) of travel information contained time data while it was 27.0% (SD: 14.3) in the NR group. 28.1% had cost data in the ER group while it was 20.7% (SD: 15.5) in the NR group. Therefore, the ER group tended to have a higher ratio of recording the time and cost information during the travel planning task. The t test shows that the difference was not significant in both cases. The results also suggest that both groups appeared to be more aware of recording the time information than the cost information.

To summarise, this section looked at the tr avel plans generat ed by participant pairs. Noticeable differences were observ ed in the types of places identified in the plans, their choices of travel methods, an d records of travel information. However, these differences were not sta tistically significant. 3.2 Search Behaviour The second set of investigation looked at p articipant information searching be-haviour during the travel planning task. To gain understanding of participant pairs search behaviours, we analysed th e number of search result pages viewed, number of web pages browsed, number of domains (e.g., www.booking.com), and number of input form pages submitted from QT-Honey logs. The results are shown in Table 2. The numbers in the NR group are a union of both members who had a PC each. As can be seen, the NR group had a greater level of search activities than the ER group. The difference was found to be significant by the t test in all aspects. However, as we obse rved earlier, these difference did not seem to have a significant impact on travel plans. 3.3 Dialogue Development As described in Section 2.3, our dialogue analysis was carried out at the first 10 minutes, middle 10 minutes, and last 10 minutes of the task.

First, we counted the number of utterances made by participants. The total number of utterances in the ER group was on average 276.2 (SD: 52.2) while the NR group was 191.3 (SD: 64.0). The Mann-Whitney test showed that the difference was significant ( p  X  . 004). This suggests that having an explicit role can facilitate the communication in a group.

Next, we analysed the development of conversation using a variant of Chan X  X  dialogue development scale [1]. We added Level 0 to Chen X  X  scale to annotate the utterances which were judged to be clea rly irrelevant to the task. The results are shown in Figure 3. We can observe that the percentage of Level 1 and 5 in the ER group was larger than the NR group while Level 2 and 3 of the NR group were larger than the ER group. The Mann-Whitney tests showed that the difference between the two groups were significant at Level 3 ( p  X  . 037) and Level 5 ( p  X  . 015). This suggests that the conversations in the ER group tended to develop further than the NR group. According to Chan X  X  scale, the NR group tended to utter to confirm a partner X  X  opinions more frequently than the ER group who, on the other hand, tended to utter to explain their opinions and make suggestions based on an issue commonly recognised by the group.
We also analysed objectives of uttera nces from two perspectives: travel and search. We observed, on average, 97.0% of utterances were about travel in the ER group and 98.4% in the NR group. Therefore, most utterances were made to discuss travel itself and only 1.6 to 3% were made to discuss specific search issues. This was common to both groups and the difference was found to be insignificant. This reinforces our intension of looking at collaborative search in the context of work task. A large proportion of group X  X  communication concerned with the goal of work task, and thus, they were likely to affect search behaviour which played a significant role to complete the travel planning task.
To summarise, this section analysed the dialogue data to examine the effects of explicit roles on travel planning tasks. The results suggest that explicit roles have significant effect to facilitate the communication between members. It also suggests that the dialogues in the ER group tended to be more advanced than the NR group. 3.4 User Perceptions The last part of our investigation looked at participants X  perceptions on the task they performed and collaboration in general.

At the end of the task, we asked participants to indicate the degree of task progress and level of satisfaction about the outcome of the task. We used a 5-point Likert scale to captur e participants X  perceptions. As for the task progress, ER group had 3.6 (SD: 1.1) on average while NR had 3.3 (1.1). As for the satisfaction, ER had 2.6 (SD: 1.1) while NR had 2.4 (1.1). Therefore, the ER group appears to have a higher level of task completion and satisfaction when compared to the NR group. However, the t tests show that the difference was not significant.

In Exit Questionnaire, we asked a seri es of questions about the task and col-laboration. One of the questions where w e observed a noticea ble difference was about potential ideas to improve the collaborative task. In the NR group, 11 participants a need for more facilitated communication, 8 participants stated a need for more efficient labour division, and 3 participants stated a need for a bet-ter planning strategy. In the ER group, on the other hand, 6 participants stated a need for a better planning strategy, 6 participants stated a need for a better use of search engines, others mentioned different aspects of planning strategy. This supports two aspects of our study. One was that the effect of independent variable. There was some observations in the search logs which suggests that there was some labour division strategy in the NR group. However, the feedback from the NR group indicates that the labour division was not effectively exe-cuted while no one mentioned about labour division in the ER group. Another was the effect of explicit roles on the communication. In the dialogue analysis, we observed that the ER group had more f requent and advanced communication than the NR group. The most frequently mentioned feedback in the NR group was about communication. This paper presented a task-based user study to examine the effects of explicit human roles on collaborative information seeking and retrieval. There are two major contributions in this paper which are discussed below.

The first contribution of this paper was to gain insight into the effects of ex-plicit roles given to group members on the performance of a collaborative search task. There are multiple findings. First, explicit roles can facilitate the com-munication between group members with advanced level of development. In our results, the NR group had more conversations for confirming a partner X  X  opinions while less for suggesting ideas. The resulted advanced communication appears to enable the ER group to be more aware of the details of a given task. On the other hand, we observed an effect of explicit roles to limit a range of opportunities that can be found by the group. This might be an artifact of our experimental set and other combinations of roles might remedy the effect. However, it is also clear that there are many remaining questions that our study did not address. One such aspect is the relationship between the shared knowledge (via dialogues) and subsequent search strategies. We are currently performing further analysis on the dialogue data along with search logs to address the problem.
The second contribution of this paper was the research design for a task-based evaluation of collaborative search. Travel planning has been known as one of the most frequently performed collaborative search task [6]. In addition, as we discussed in Section 1, travel planning is an intellectually complex task, and therefore, it is worth a careful consideration on research methodology. In this paper, we proposed a set of dependent variables that can be used to measure effects of independent variables in the context of travel planning tasks. Those includes the properties of travel plans g enerated and dialogue analyses in addi-tion to conventional searching behaviour and subjective task assessments. We do not claim that this is a definitive set of dependent variables, but we consider that it is significantly more holistic than existing work in this area. Collaborative search is a complex research problem, and a task-based investigation is crucial to understand underlying issues of the activity. We are interested in revising what we deviced in this study, as well as, developing dependent variables for other types of collaborative search tasks, as future work.
