The cyber-physical systems (CPS) are envisioned as a class of real-time systems integrating the computing, com-munication and storage facilities with monitoring and con-trol of the physical world. One interesting CPS application in the mobile Internet is to provide Web search X  X n the spot X  regarding the physical world that a user sees, or literally WYRIWYS (What-You-Retrieve-Is-What-You-See).

WYRIWYS cannot be readily addressed by the existing location-based Web search (abbreviated LWS onwards) [1, 2] due to the following reasons. First, LWS retrieves objects andcomputesthe query/objectrelevance by combiningtheir content relevancy and geometric proximity. Therefore it is unaware of the visibility of the physical entities of the Web objects to the user. Objects spatially close to the user may always be retrieved whether they are being monitored by the user or not. Second, the data management scheme of LWS typically integrates spatial indexes with an inverted index. Search service built on such scheme is likely to ignore crucial cyber-physical events, for example change of user orientation, which are considered as useful feedback cues for interaction with the CPS.

The objective of our work is to develop server/browser software to support WYRIWYS search in our prototype cyber-physical search engine. A WYRIWYS search retrieves visible Web objects and ranks them by their cyber-physical relevances (term, visual, spatial, temporal etc.). The search server contains three key components: (1) A database of Web objects, where each object is associated with a set of highly correlated Web documents. (2) A term-visibility in-dexer which indexes the Web objects by keywords and view-ing regions. The indexer also maintains the quantitative measures of the visibility of the Web objects with regard to different viewing regions. Given a set of keywords and a
