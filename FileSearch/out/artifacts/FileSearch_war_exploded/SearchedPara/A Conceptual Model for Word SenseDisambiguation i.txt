 In natural language processing (NLP), word-sense disambiguation (WSD) is an open problem which governs the task of automatically assigning the appropriate meaning to an ambiguous word (i.e. having multiple meanings). The solution to this problem [1] [6][13][14] impacts other computer-related domains, such as information retrieval, machine translation and summarization.

In medical domain, several studies [5][19] have shown that medical text is extremely ambiguous: a word can have s everal connotations depending on the context in which it belongs.
 For example, the word  X  X old X  is ambiguous as it has several senses 1 [15]. It may refer to a disease ( X  X  am taking aspirin for my cold X ), a temperature sensation ( X  X et X  X  go inside, I X  X  cold X ), or an environmental condition ( X  X t X  X  cold today, only 2 degrees X ). In addition to the word ambiguity, we note also the abbreviation ambiguity. For example, the  X  X AO X  abbreviation stands for multiple health-related organi-zations including the  X  X merican Association of Ophthalmology X , the  X  X merican Association of Orthodontists X  and the  X  X merican Academy of Otolaryngology X . Most of works for WSD in medical domain propose to map textual informa-tion into concepts using external seman tic resources such as WordNet like in [10] or Unified Medical Langage System (UMLS 2 ). The basic idea behind the text mapping into concepts is that the w hole sentence and the context of each word is used to choose the appropriate con cepts. Nevertheless, it is possible to find different concepts for the same word or the same sentence. For example, using the MetaMap tool, the sentence  X  X x X  is mapped into 7 concepts (Texas, Turkmenistan, Therapeutic procedure, Tumor stage TX, CASP4 gene,CASP4 protein, CASP4 wt Allele). A new problem appears: using erroneous concepts to map the medical text can negatively affects the WSD methods. Consequently, mapping medical text to medical concep ts resolves partially the word sens am-biguity. The problem becomes, thus, the concept sens desambiguation (CSD). Some solutions are proposed by using other external resources as Medline and MESH [11], to choose relevant concepts through all candidates concepts, but in our knowledge and as mentioned in [12], semantic relations between extracted concepts are not used in CSD.

In this paper, we present a conceptu al model to solve the word sens ambi-guity problem using the semantic relati ons between extracted concepts through MetaMap tool, using UMLS Metathesaurus. More precisely, we compute seman-tic relations between UMLS candidates c oncepts using two semantic measures. Then, we build a semantic graph by removi ng isolated (not related) concepts. To evaluate our model, we have used medical image collection 3 for two reasons: (1) only few textual information as image caption and document title will be mapped into concepts. So, in the most o f cases, candidates concepts are few and consequently ambiguous: the more we have information, the lesser we have ambiguity. (2)Medical image collection is less time consuming than medical doc-ument collection. Several experiments are carried out using the Medical Image CLEF 2009 collection, and results show that our method outperforms the WSD solution of MetaMap tool.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss the literature works related in medic al WSD. Section 3 explains our method, while section 4 describes our experiments and results. Finally, section 5 provides a conclusion and some future works. In this section, we review some WSD works in medical domain. Authors in [7] pro-pose a context-based method to disambiguate gene/protein name in biomedical documents. More precisely, instead of directly using all of a word X  X  surrounding words, they propose only the selection of certain words with high  X  X iscriminating X  capabilities as features. These features are then used to represent each instance of the word. This method is based on machine learning and can be viewed as a context-based classification approach. Results show the effectivenessof the method in achieving impressive accura cy, precision and recall rates.
 Several studies investigate the use of external resources such as UMLS Metathesaurus to solve the WSD problem [8] [3] [2]. The idea is to map text into concepts using, for example, the Me taMaptoolwithamedicalsemanticon-tology as UMLS or MESH 4 . MetaMap tool proposes also a dataset for WSD [11] in medical domain called MSH WSD Test Collection 5 . This latter contains both biomedical words and abbreviations and it is automatically created using the UMLS Metathesaurus and the manual MeSH indexing of MEDLINE. Authors in [11] note that this technique does not cover all the meanings of the words and that more work is needed to solve this problem.

To summarize, Word Sens Disambiguation remains a challenging problem in medical domain, and the most of recent w orks use external r esources to solve this problem as UMLS Metathesaurus. How ever, semantic relations between ex-tracted concepts are not outright (or enough) used to resolve WSD. In this section, we present our concep tual model for medical WSD. As many literature works, we propose the use of co ncepts instead of words to represent textual information. However, errone ous concepts could be selected and con-sequently the document meaning will be affected. To overcome this problem, we propose the calculation of relations between concepts, and only related con-cepts will be selected. In fact, isolated co ncepts will be considered as erroneous concepts and should not be selected to re present the text information. To map text into concepts, we use the MetaMap tool using UMLS Metathesaurus, and to compute relations between candidate concepts, a semantic and a contextual measures are used. Then, we build a sem antic graph where concepts are nodes and relations are edges. Finally, concepts that are not related to the graph are removed. An overview of our WSD model, in information retrieval context, is done in Figure 1. 3.1 Mapping Text to Concepts The aim of this step is to map text into concepts. For this purpose, we start by preprocessing the collection in order to keep only significant words. Then, we use the MetaMap 6 tool to map words into concep ts. Concept extraction steps using MetaMap are the following: 1. Parse the text into noun phrases; 2. Produce noun phrase variants wherever a variant consists of one or more 3. Look for different candidate concepts from all metathesaurus containing one 4. Use an evaluation function to compute the mapping strength from the noun 5. Combine candidate concepts involved with disjoint parts of the noun phrase, For exemple the mapping of the phrase  X  X eart attack trial X  give a sets of condi-date concepts (meta condidates), each candidate is represented by its MetaMap score, its concept name in the Metathesaurus and its semantic type in the Se-mantic Network, whereas t he second section (meta mapping) give as a result the highest scoring candidates. For the example of  X  X eart attack trial X  MetaMap tool generates the concepts ID C0027051 and C0008976 , which represent re-spectively  X  X eart attack X  from the semantic type  X  X isease or Syndrome X  and  X  X rial X  from the semantic type  X  X esearch Activity X  , as the best results between the eight meta-condidates.

Authors in [9] reveale that a total of 17 022 (24.3%) of associations (parent-child) between UMLS notions can not be justified according to the semantic categories of concepts. Among several cases that can produce artificial relations, we cite:  X  Cases where the semantic category of the child is very broad whereas the  X  Situations where the parent-child relationship is erroneous;  X  Cases where a parent-child relationship is lacking and have to be added to  X  Conditions where the parent or the child is missing a semantic category; To avoid these problems, we propose the s election of the most relevant concepts, which are close to the significant meaning of the image. Therefore, candidate concepts extracted through the MetaMap tool will be the input of the semantic graph building described in the next section. 3.2 Semantic Graph Building Having a set of candidate concepts for each image description, a semantic dis-tance is computed between each pair of con cepts, after this step we remove every concepts that are not related to the grap h and not related to any other concept. We construct, thus, a graph: concepts are considered vertexes and relations are considered edges. Relations between two concepts i and j are determined as follows: Semantic similarity measures are classified into three different categories:  X  The similarity measure that is based on the number of edges, is called in this  X  The similarity measure that is based on the information content, is called in  X  The hybrid similarity measure (information content and number of edges), Semantic Distance The concept selection is based on the similarity measure through the number of edges between two concepts using the hi erarchical structure  X  X s-a X  of UMLS. One of the most noticeable ways to estimate semantic similarity in a category is to determine the distance between notions, using the shortest path as a unit.
Computing the similarity based on the number of edges restricting the  X  X s-a X  relation has two difficulties:  X  Granularity: concepts lay down the th esaurus and then the more specific the  X  Density: a concept having many children is more similar to its children than
Figure 2 illustrates an example of using the semantic measure to construct the semantic graph.
 According to this figure, D1 is a docu ment presented by C1, C2, C5, C7 and C8. After the weighting step, D1 is presented only by C1, C2 and C5. C7 and C8 are removed because they do not have an y relationship with other concepts. Contextual Distance To correct the lack of every relationship in the UMLS, we propose the hybridiza-tion of the semantic distance with the contextual distance which is computed between two concepts, using their definition according to UMLS.

We choose to apply the cosine measure to compute the similarity between the two concepts definitions. Words of both definitions def1 and def2 are presented in vectors A and B. Each word in the definition presents a dimension in the Euclidean space and the frequency of each word corresponds to the value in the dimension. Then, the cosine similarity measure is used as follow: Combination of Semantic and Contextual Distances For the UMLS, some relationships are missing between concepts, so using only semantic measure is not sufficient. Consequently, the use of a hybridization be-tween contextual and semantic distanc e is appreciated. The distance measure becomesasfollows: Using the example of Figure 2, Figure 3 shows the hybridization step.
Usingbothdistances,D1ispresentedbyC1,C2,C5,andC7,sinceC7hasa contextual relationship with C2 and C5.

So as it is shown in the figure, we remove all the concepts that are not related to either the graph, or any other concept.
 From Weighted Graph to Binary Graph Taking into account the problems mentioned in section 3.1, the semantic weight between two concepts is not always efficient and do not reflect always the real semantic matching between two concepts. F or example, if a child-parent relation between two concepts is missed, similarity measures that are based on edges, such as the path length, will be affected and consequently the semantic distance weight will be incorrect.

Moreover, when using similarity measures based on the information content of the concepts, the weight can be affect ed, due to the term ambiguity problem of concept definitions.

For these reasons, we propose the translation of the obtained weighted graph into a binary graph, without taking into account the relation weights. Figure 4 gives an example of transforming a weighted graph to a binary one.
Using the binary graph, we take into account the existence of a semantic relation between two concepts, but negl ecting the percentage of this semantic matching.
 3.3 Retrieval Model We use the semantic vector model to compute the similarity between documents and queries. This model is an extension of the vector space model (SVM) [17] [16], in which, each dimension represents an ontology concept instead of a term. Documents and queries are represented by a vector with n dimensions where n is the number of the ontology concepts [18].

The vector space has N dimension ( N is the number of concepts of the col-lection). Each document D j is represented by a vector of concepts : D Each query Q is represented by a vector of concepts: Q =( wq 1 ,wq 2 ,wq 3 , ..., cq N ), with:  X  w ij is the weight of the concept C i in the document D j ;  X  wq i is the weight of the concept C i in the query Q .
 The value of system relevance is calculated using a similarity function called RSV ( Q, d ) (Retrieval Status Value) where Q is a query and a document D j base. The RSV measure is the following:
We propose to use two formulas to compute each concept weight:  X  The concept frequency as shown in the following:  X  The inverse document frequency as shown in the following:
In order to integrate the semantic distance in the RSV function, we propose the following formula: with:  X  N and k are respectively the number of qu ery concepts and document con- X  Dist ( C iQ ,C jD ) is the distance between the document concept and the query 4.1 Dataset and Tools To evaluate our approach, we use the 2009 ImageCLEF 7 collection composed of 74,902 medical images and annotations associated with them. This collection contains images and captions from Radiology and Radiographic, two Radiologi-cal Society of North America (RSNA) 8 journals. The number of queries is 25. The evaluation measures to use are P@5, P@10 and Mean Average Precision MAP. 4.2 Results In this section, we will present the different results obtained by our WSD model. Comparison between Distance Measures Table 1 compares results obtained by real d istance (Eq. 8) with semantic, contex-tual distance and hybridization of both, according to cf and cf*idf. According to this table, the Cf*idf weight improves the results obtained by the Cf weight. This can be justified by the fact that the Cf*idf model does not take into account the concepts which are very common thoro ugh the collection. For example the term  X  X edical X  presented by the ID C0205476, it is very common in our area of research, the use of cf*idf will reduce its importance in the retrieval process. Also, we note that the use of hybrid distance help to correct the lack of rela-tionship in the UMLS. However, despite attempts to improve performance by hybridization, the results obtained by the real distance are outstanding need for improvement, this can be justified by the fact that the semantic relations between concepts are not of hight qualit y, and further researchs are needed to improve the impact of the relat ions between the two concepts.
 We made same experiences by binary di stance instead of t he real distance. We note that the contextual distance improves slightly the results obtained, and even by the binary distance, the hybridization between the two distances improves the results.

Table 2 compares best results obtained by real distance (Eq. 8) and binary distance (Eq. 5) with the hybridization between the contextual and semantic distance. We note that the use of binary distance is better than the use of real distance (improvement of 35 % accord ing to the MAP measure). This can be justified by the fact that conceptual measures between concepts are not of hight quality, more work is needed to reach more better results.
 Comparison of our Approach with Other WSD Methods Table 3 compares our model with Metamap tool (i.e. without WSD) and WSD MetaMap (i.e. WSD method proposed by MetaMap). In this comparison, we use the hybrid distance, the cf  X  idf weighting schema and the binary graph.
According to this table, we note that WSD MetaMap and our model results are better than MetaMap ones. This observation affirms that the use of a WSD solution improves the retri eval accuracy. These result s are justified by the pres-ence of the terms that are out of context, in a model that does not use a method of WSD, these terms can guide the ret rieval model to erroneous results. Additionally, cancerning the P@5 measure, our WSD model outperforms WSD MetaMap model by 9.8%. As for the MAP measure, our WSD model outperforms the WSD MetaMap model by 22.5% . Consequently, we can conclude that the use of concept relations to disambiguate concepts is a good solution. These results are justified by the presence o f the concepts that are out of context, in WSD MetaMap model, on the other hand, with our method we removed these erroneous concepts. We have proposed a conceptual model for word sens disambiguation in medical domain. The main finding is that using the semantic relations between medical concepts allows for an efficient disambiguation.

We have also discovered that the use of binary distance (weight is either 1 or 0) between concepts gives better results than the use ofreal distance. This observation shows that more studies are needed in th e semantic distance measures to really compute the semantic similarity between two concepts.

In future work, we plan to solve the relation weight problem and to propose a semantic similarity distance to calculate a disambiguation degree that can be included in our WSD model.
