 'Approved for Public Release: 12-2151 This extended abstract provides a summary of MITRE X  X  Recommender demonstrations for ACM RecSys 2012. We have three demonstrations: Event Recommender, Contact Recommender, and Group Recommende r. MITRE is a technology company with thousands of staff and varied government customers. Help from recommenders is becoming a necessity to find the right resources to bring to bear on large, multidisciplinary problems. We have developed a nd deployed these recommenders to explore their effectiveness, implementation challenges for an enterprise, and their use models. H.4.m [Information Systems A pplications]: Miscellaneous Algorithms, Design, Experimentation recommenders, enterprise Recommenders are everywhere in commerce and social networking sites. They benefit from millions of users and are driven by the potential for increased revenue. By contrast, recommenders for business enterprise are scarce. While the enterprise has orders of magnitude fewer users, it has the potential for higher fidelity information about employees to make effective recommendations. The authors are exploring the benefits and use of recommenders at the MITRE Corp, a high tech knowledge-based enterprise. Currently at MITRE there are three deployed prototype recommender systems to help knowledge workers make connections with pertinent even ts, people, and groups. The first demo is an  X  X vent Recomme nder X  available from MITRE X  X  intranet portal. The second demo is a  X  X ontact Recommender X  used in MITRE X  X  external facing social and collaboration system called  X  X andshake X . The third demo is a  X  X roup Recommender X  also in MITRE X  X  external Handshake environment. All three leverage the open source recommender framework, Apache Mahout. MITRE is a diverse technical company with many events for disseminating and sharing technical information. The company X  X  innovation program hosts internal events to bring staff together to form new research topics and proposals. Additionally, there are informal sessions such as lunchtime  X  X rown bags X  that are very popular. MITRE has a long standing culture of organizing more formal Technical Exchange m eetings (TEMs) to support the networking and sharing customer and technical challenges. Due to the volume of events, staff may miss an event announcement or not have the time to drill into materials to determine if it X  X  of interest and value. The Event Recommender draws from the corporate feed of ev ents, together with the user X  X  event interests and organizational memberships to make event recommendations. The initial challenge we had to overcome was seeding the user interest data. Very few events at MITRE required registration so no data from past events attended was available to initialize the staff event interests. We developed an Event Recommender gadget for our intranet portal that provides easy and convenient features for the user to add events to their calendar and remove events from the suggested event list. We are capturing the users  X  X dd to calendar X  and  X  X emove from list X  actions to determine their event interest. There has been a pent up demand for the  X  X dd to calendar X  feature so it is a winning combination. In addition to collecting user X  X  event interest data, we are addressing the cold start problem by considering the social structure of the corporation. Events may be recommended that are being attended by other member s of the user X  X  department, division (collection of departme nts) or center (collection of divisions). The closer the organi zational relationship, the higher the recommendation is weighted. Future versions of the event recommender will also make use of social network connections. We developed the backend services to persist and feed event and user data to the Event Recommender engine which is using the collaborative filtering algorithm from Apache Mahout [2]. The recommendation is calculated each time the user goes to their portal page or when they select or delete an event from the list. The demonstration will show the easy to use interface, convenience features and the updated recommendations based upon the user X  X  selection of events. MITRE has an externally facing collaboration and business networking system called Handsha ke. MITRE staff invite in colleagues to Handshake who are customers, industry or academic partners, or consultants. People can connect or follow each other and join groups for discussion and information sharing. The Contact and Group Recommenders use the Handshake network, profile, tags, and group membership to recommend new groups or colleagues. Recommendations are di splayed in widgets that users can add to their Handshake home page. In a large enterprise there are often many people working on similar topics or problems, and there is a significant risk of duplicating work, or missing releva nt information, particularly when the organization is geographically dispersed. The Handshake contact recommender [1] is designed to recommend people to connect with based on common interests or activities. The contact recommender uses information from multiple sources, both within the Handsha ke environment and on MITRE X  X  intranet, and aggregates that in formation to determine who would most benefit from being in contact. The sources that are used include MITRE X  X  internal social bookmarking tool, wiki environment, email lists, as well as group memberships and existing connections on Handshake. The contact recommender presents a list of recommended contacts on the user X  X  Handshake home page, including convenient links to add those pe ople as connections as well as links for retrieving additional e xplanations regarding the reason for the recommendation. Contact recommendations have been available on Handshake since June of 2011. User studies of the contact recommender have found that the recommendations are relevant and that people are using them to make connections. One of the most frequently requested features since the release of Handshake has been an easier way to find relevant groups to join. Handshake has hundreds of user-c reated groups and the number of groups is growing all the time. Currently the only ways to find out about groups are by word of mouth, or by manually browsing the list of groups. To address this problem, we have implemented a group recommender for Handshake that uses Apache Mahout X  X  [2] collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend groups. The group recommender is in prototype stage and has not yet been deployed on Handshake. Group recommendations are subject to a significant cold start problem in that the users who most need recommendations for groups are new Handshake memb ers who belong to very few groups, if any. Therefore, the collaborative filtering approach needs to be augmented by additional recommendation approaches for these new users. In addition to group recommendations derived from collaborative filtering, the group recommender will make use of the enterprise-wide social and organizational structure, similar to the event recommender, in order to recommend groups that may be of interest to new users. The demonstration will show the recommendation widgets for both contact and group recommendations as they are displayed to users on Handshake.
