 Textual entailment is an important issue in the study of natural language understand-ing. Due to early and well-developed English language analysis tools like WordNet or grammar parser, many approaches like [1] and so on for English textual entailment were proposed. In contrast, there are fewer applications for Chinese language analysis and the performance is not so good like that for English. Apparently, Chinese textual entailment is still quite a difficult issue.

The model mainly uses about 26 features and a machine learning algorithm is utilized as a classifier for the model and features of  X  X nstruction System X  question bank are employed to be input for scoring process. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses previous related studies and indicates relations between our proposed method and previous methods. Section 3 introduces features and grading method developed by this study.

The clas-sification of Chinese articles has been welcomed by many researchers. [5] utilized nat-ural language processing to understand the context of Chinese questions. [6 X 8] used guide list method and word segmentation technology. Under normal circumstances, be-fore word segmentation, pre-processing like removing punctuation, tables and graphics should have been done. Whether to retain English characters should rely on the spe-cific needs of application. The current word segmentation algorithm is divided into four parts: string matching word segmentation, understanding word segmentation, statistical word segmentation and semantic segmentation. This study needs to get rid of redundant words referred to [9]. Word string matching calculation and other current algorithms are all based on semantic dictionary or corpus word semantic similarity algorithm. Besides, this experiment will apply artificial intelligence and use string length, sequence, shape and so on to perform multi-level comparison calculations.
 [10]. [11] has built large data sets about math words that was deserved consideration to try to mine features. [12] listed labels and used differentiated labels after statistics as input. [13] seriously discussed four labels. [14] gave inspiration for attributes setting, which added external labels such as environment labels. In this paper, we combine these three methods and also referred to [15 X 17]. For assessing the feature of  X  X ption simi-larity X , Chinese scoring technique like [18] and so on are effective. In the meanwhile, [19]discusses the design and implementation of an optimization algorithm of automatic grading for subjective questions by using Chinese words segmentation, based on which, this paper filled in the appropriate parameters flexibly and optimize the mathematical formula.

 has investigated or tried to grade Chinese questions X  difficulty using 4 attributes with 26 features. 3.1 Algorithm Architecture Fig. 1: An overview of architecture. Given a dataset, a high-precision model is induced. ing, but also includes a knowledge tree and a mechanism of attributes setting. As shown teaching material based on word segmentation module. Then, a useful dataset should be prepared for training the model, which should remove the oral words, stop words and duplicate words. For this problem, there are four kinds of attributes should be extracted. Finally, necessary features sorted out by certain methods act as input for machine learn-ing, and the difficulty grading is the output. 3.2 Knowledge Tree Model of  X  X nstruction system X  text of  X  X rinciples of Computer Organization X  teaching mate-rial. Each leaf node represents a knowledge point that was labeled by index with point and number. The index can be used to gain the depth of hit knowledge node and span between hit knowledge nodes. The relationship between knowledge nodes consists of the weight and the connection relation like equivalence, subclass or some other else. a question, we can gain every depth through its points number, the depth of  X 1.1 X  is that  X  Depth (1 . 1) = P ointsnumber (1 . 1) + 1 = 2  X , the depth of  X 1.2.2 X  is that  X  Depth (1 . 2 . 2) = P ointsnumber (1 . 2 . 2) + 1 = 3  X , and the Depth of  X 1.1.1.1.2.2 X  is  X 1.1.1.1.2.2 X  are in the same branch as shown in Fig. 3, the span between them can k 2  X  6 k = 4  X , while because  X 1.2.2 X  and  X 1.1.1.1.2.2 X  are not in the same branch, their common node  X 1 X  should be found, then the span between them can be gained through multiply the weight between two near knowledge nodes.
 corpus, the stop word corpus and the remove duplicate module, through the word seg-mentation method. Index, weight, connection relation, trunk and leaf knowledge nodes are important parts.
 3.3 Attributes Box A question consists of conditions, questions, options, answers, and analysis, the treat-ment standard of the difficulty analysis for a question is shown as Table 1. The artificial thinking for judging the difficulty of a question generally includes four attributes ( e.g. quantity, relationship, span range, environmental attributes and so on). To summarise, study on the question difficulty involves some attributes of knowledge points, options, the question words, analysis words, the number of non-Chinese characters variables and basic conditions of the question writers, etc.
 Attribute of Knowledge Tree Knowledge tree attributes contains the knowledge depth, knowledge span, knowledge number, the word frequency in the textbook, and the num-ber of the relationship between the near knowledge nodes for a question. The word segment of a question is the same as the leaf node of the knowledge tree is called hit knowledge node or hit knowledge point. Every attribute is as follows: (1) Knowledge Depth . Base on the number of the point of the index for the hit knowl-(2) Knowledge Span . There is span between different hit knowledge nodes. The aver-(3) Number of knowledge . The number of hit knowledge nodes. The more the number, (4) Knowledge Word Frequency . The average frequency for the hit knowledge nodes. (5) Relationship Number . Theoretically, there is connection relation like equivalence, Algorithm 1 Span between near nodes Attribute of Quantity Relationship Quantity Relationship includes word number of the whole question, analysis length, the number of Non-Chinese character and the num-ber of unknown words /new words. The label rules for each attribute are shown below, word number of the whole question consists of condition word number and option word number, analysis length is counted separately, it is hard to understand non-Chinese char-acter, so that it is necessary to count the number of non-Chinese characters such as let-ters, symbols and so on of conditions and options. Besides, the knowledge tree model is built based on the textbook, the more the unknown words beyond the scope of the knowledge tree, the more difficult the question should be.
 Attribute of User Portrait The degree of difficulty is connected with the character of writers or some other external factors. Under normal circumstances, students with good performance, serious and challenging character are more probably going to deal with hard questions. Hence, external user portrait features with study performance can also be added to the attributes box.
 Attribute of Option Similarity Option similarity of a question consists of internal at-tributes with magnitude and knowledge coverage and external attributes with sentence length and grammatical morphology. Hybrid options contain numeric and text content. It is need to compare two options firstly. And with the increase of the number of options, the dimension of similarity features will increase. For example: if there are AB two op-tions, the similarity of A and B is needed. If there are ABC three options, the similarities of AB, AC, BC are needed, and so on, in order to form a combination pattern. tively represent StringMagnitude, StringKnowledgeSimila, StringLengthSimilarity, String-CutLengthSimilarity and StringPartSimilarity. W denotes the unit column vector. rules are as follows: (1) Internal Attributes Algorithm 2 StringMagnitude (2) External Attributes Algorithm 3 StringKnowledgeSimilary Algorithm 4 Similarity Value of SL,SC,SP 4.1 Question Bank Data Preprocessing This experiment data, 1409 reliable questions have been exacted from the database of the website of  X 121.42.194.20 X , i.e.  X  X rinciples of Computer Organization X  online ed-ucation system which is directed by our laboratory professor. 1 The unreliable questions with non-standard format, serious oral problems and so on have been removed, the re-liable questions should be cleaned up and supplemented, and the superfluous spaces and symbols should be deleted. The extracted questions have been dissected as ques-tion number, condition, question writer number (student number or nickname), option A, option B, option C, option D, answer, analysis, chapter and so on. According to the classification of the subject category, the  X  X nstruction system X  chapter has 341 ques-tions, this 340 questions are classified by three levers including 125 easy questions, 114 medium questions and 101 hard questions. 4.2  X  X nstruction System X  Ontology Knowledge Tree Building Textbook  X  X omputer organization X  is used to be knowledge corpus material.  X  X nstruc-tion System X  knowledge tree has been built by Prot  X  eg  X  e . First of all, we count Chi-nese characters, figures and signals in the book above, so as to get 24726 words and 1610 kinds of words totally. Secondly, we compare it with oralword (Speech corpus) and stopword (Punctuation corpus), then remove the colloquia and replicate words, and build a synonyms system. Thirdly, complete the index number for every leaf node from the cleaned and supplemented knowledge tree from top to bottom, to finish a full knowl-edge tree, as shown in Fig. 4.
 4.3 Outcome of Classification Accuracy This study has put the data of 26 (Attributes)  X  340 (Instances) into several machine learning algorithms classifiers, results of which are obtained in Table 2(a), among which, the  X  X  X  value for KNN is from 1 to 150, the average accuracy interval for 1000 times Table 3: Detailed accuracy (Top lines for 3 classes and bottom lines for 2 classes) with 5 folds is [56.47%(k=149),71.15%(k=16)] for 2 classes, and [39.45%(k=149), 47.14%(k=21)] for 3 classes, meaning that the worst results of ADGM are better than random guesses. It can be seen that the random forest algorithm is the best choice for the classifier, based on which, the classification result of Table 4 can be get. As shown in Table 2(b), the correctly classified accuracy is 61.2069 % by using 66% percentage split for training data and 34% left for testing data. The detailed accuracy is shown in Table 3. The correctly classified accuracy is 77.4336% by using cross-validation with 10 fold. And the detailed accuracy is shown in Table 3. In this study, we addressed the problem of automatically difficulty grading for a Chi-nese question. We propose an Automatically Difficulty Grading Model (ADGM) based on random forest machine learning algorithm. Evaluation results demonstrate that the summaries produced by our proposed model have high accuracy and recall. In the mean-while, a question bank and a knowledge tree were contributed. In this study, we do not consider the logicality of a question, because it is really very challenging to get the logicality. In the future, besides studying the logicality, we will explore to make use of all of the chapters to improve the knowledge tree, so that the difficulty factors can be automatically applied for generating a test paper.
