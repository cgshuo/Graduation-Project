 With the explosive growth of digital content providing services on the Web, a suitable recommender system has become an important component for personalization of tive [1][2]. Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most successful recommendation [2][3]. However, conventional CF methods suffer from a few fundamental limitations. One of the limitations is the  X  X ecommender reliability problem. X  Another challenging issue is ability of recommendation mechanisms to be adaptable to environment where users have heterogeneous susceptibility on information sources [4]. 
In order to address these issues, it is necessary to reflect various consumer psycho-consumer behavior theory to Web content recommendation method through the inte-gration of technological and managerial pe rspectives. The proposed approach extracts analysis. The results of the experiment using the real Web usage data verified that the content recommendation. the items that those neighbors had liked in the past. CF method automates the "word [5]. Therefore, CF based recommender systems should form a group of recommend-customer, consequently. 
Traditional CF method forms a recommender group that comprises the nearest neighbors whose preferences are similar to those of a target user. It selects the users CF methods have a few fundamental problems. One of them is the recommender reliability problem, which is addressed in recent researches [6][7][8]. It means that a recommender might not be reliable for a given item or set of items, even though the recommender X  X  and target user X  X  preferences are similar [7]. In addition, an informa-tion source has various attributes and the level of a customer X  X  value about the attrib-utes of a source varies with reference to the characteristics of the user [9]. For exam-users that have similar preferences, while others depend on the opinions of users that heterogeneous. However, conventional similarity-based CF cannot reflect this impor-another fundamental problem of the similarity-based CF lies. ity, and so on) have been identified as key components in the solution to secure trans-actions in e-commerce [10][11][12][13]. As a countermeasure to the abovementioned [6][7][14] have been proposed. These techniques derive the neighbors X  trust explicitly recommender reliability problem. 
Although a trust or expertise metric has been employed for trust-based CF in order  X  X rust X  to mean  X  X rustworthiness, X  whereas another study used it as  X  X xpertise. X  Some papers have used the terms  X  X rustworthy X  and  X  X redible X  synonymously. Second, more fundamentally, there is not enough theoretical background to introduce a trust or expertise metric, in addition to the similarity metric, to CF recommendation systems. which attributes of a human recommender as an information source are pertinent. 
Therefore, we introduce source credibility model to recommender systems to ex-Source credibility model has been proposed in the WOM communications studies of consumer psychology and marketing [15][16].

However, there has been no research that employs the conjoint proach to the neighbor selection problem with the source credibility model.

The overall process of the proposed Web content recommendation method consists of the offline mining phase and the online recommendation phase (see Figure 1). 5.1 Offline Mining Phase Step 1: Creating Us er Rating Profile he or she has a high preference for it. We define the user rating profile ing the previous approach [21] related to web usage mining and making it suitable for Web content service as follows: Where, m : the number of items tively, by a user for each item. The value of increasing frequencies. The weights for each step are not the same although they look equal, as shown in Equation 2, since the customers who purchased a specific content not only clicked the web pages related to it but also previewed the content. Therefore, Step 2: Deriving Source Credibility Attributes 1) Expertise Measurement We define expertise as the degree of a user X  X  competency to provide an accurate pre-nition, we devised a measure of expertise reflecting the users X  activity and prediction competency. To measure the prediction competency, we employ and improve the user X  X  prediction competency for the item should be underestimated. Thus, we intro-exception of user u , in an item when the number of raters in an item is less than 10; otherwise, it is 1. See Equation 3. Where,  X  : n/10 if n &lt; 10, otherwise 1 ( n : number of raters except user u )  X  : tolerance range expertise with more rating activities for more items, we add activity weighting to the measure in the previous research. If the nu mber of ratings for items by the user con- X  is the number of ratings of the user considered/average number of ratings of all the users; otherwise,  X  u = 1. Where,  X  : activity weighting n : rating set with ratings in item i m : item sets with the ratings of user u 2) Trustworthiness Measurement users in the community for five movies are 3-5-4-3-5, and the ratings of an individual provide false representation. Thereby, a user X  X  trustworthiness could be measured by the similarity between the user X  X  ratings and the averages of the ratings given by the coefficient, which sets the range for trustworthiness from 0 to 1. 50; otherwise, it is n/50, where n is the number of ratings of the user [22]. This pro-vides a user who has many ratings for the items with a high trustworthiness value. Where, R u,i : rating of user u for item i R average, i : average rating of the users in the community for item i  X  : significance weighting m : number of user u  X  X  rated items 3) Similarity Measurement Similarity is defined as the rating similarity between two users. To measure the rating widely used in conventional CF methods, is employed. The similarity between user u many co-ratings with the other user. Where, R u,i : rating of user u for item i R v,i : rating of user v for item i  X  : significance weighting m : number of co-rated items Step 3: Extracting Each User X  X  Part-worths about the credibility attributes develop a model from the equation 1. 1) Value of an information source The value of an information source can be measured in various aspects. Because CF methods, however, do not expose the provider to a target user, it is needed to estimate shown in equation 7. Where, V a,u : the target user a X  X  evaluation of user u R a,i : the rating of the user a for the item i R u,i : the rating of the user u for the item i m : the number of co-rated items C : a constant items with the target user, we include the users who have minimum 20 items co-rated with the target user. 2) Attributes Thus, the equation 1 can be rewritten as like below. where, V a,u : the target user a X  X  evaluation of user u (known) p target user a (unknown) x present in information source u, and 0 otherwise (known) M , M t , M s : the number of levels of expertise, trustworthiness, and similarity  X  : random error with normal distribution 3) Levels ence to the number and the range of levels [19]. finding unknown variables.

Step 4: Selecting the Most Valuable Neighbors Step 5: Generating Recommendation for the item from the conventional CF equation below. We use similarity between two users as the sole weight for prediction because the CF prediction formula is optimized to the correlation coefficient for similarity. 6.1 Benchmark Systems methods as follows: (1) Similarity-based CF (SCF): Neighbor selection by similarity (2) Trust-based CF (TCF): Neighbor selection by similarity and trust (expertise) model (The proposed method) 6.2 Data Set and Evaluation Metrics We have evaluated the feasibility and advantages of our proposed method with a real Web usage data set and purchasing data from Paran.com (www.paran.com), which is comics content (digitalized comic books), logged from 1 July to 31 December 2005. validation set contained the remaining items . We calculated the source credibility and benchmark systems in the validation set. 
To evaluate the performance of the systems, we employed two broad classes of rec-ommendation accuracy metrics. The first class is predictive accuracy metrics. Here, we use the MAE to compare each system X  X  predictive accuracy. MAE is the absolute dif-ference between an actual and a predicted rating value. The second class is classifica-tion accuracy metrics. To evaluate how well the recommendation lists match the user X  X  preferences, we employ the widely used precision, recall, and F1 measures. 6.3 Experimental Results Table 3 shows the predictive and classification accuracy of each benchmark method. that of TCF at a significance level of 1%.

This part-worth table enables us to identify the sources in a group or market segment for a specific product domain. Currently, most CF recommendation methods do not consider the customers X  hetero-attributes. It was proven that the proposed method could improve the performance of experiments. First, it has upgraded the existing CF X  X  neighbor selection process by adopting source credibility model and conjoint analysis. This enabled CF to include multi-dimensional Thereby, theoretical background about the cr edibility and trust related concept can be established.
