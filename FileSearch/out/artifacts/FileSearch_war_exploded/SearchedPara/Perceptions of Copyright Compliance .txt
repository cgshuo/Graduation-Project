 Modern technology provides the opportunity to readily copy and distribute pirated versions of copy righted material. In many cases this material is indistinguishable from the original. Since today X  X  information assurance (IA) students are tomorrow X  X  security specialists, they must maintain an increased sensitivity to the protection of intellectual property. Do these future security specialists hold this knowledge, or does society simply assume that they do? Are today X  X  IA programs successfully instilling this sensitivity? Hiring managers make certain assumptions about these security students that extend into the work force when designing and developing compute r-based collaborative systems. Are these assumptions correct? The answers to these questions and more will be reported in the results of a research project on the student awareness of copyright laws among the IA students at a Midwestern university and will evaluate the effectiveness of current curriculum.
 K.4.2 [ Computer Milieux ]: Computers and Society  X  social issues . Human Factors, Legal Aspects Copyright law, information assu rance, intellectual property, Internet copying, copyright violations Traditionally, small groups of creative individuals formed relationships with business owne rs who had the means to publish and distribute their work. These re lationships played an important role in the design of copyright laws, of which the typical consumer was unaware [2]. T oday, the Internet provides consumers with all of the publishing and distribution tools necessary for instantaneous global distribution of music, films, and literary works. However, it has been slow to include consumers in the culture developed and followed by the original publishers and distributors who creat ed it. As technologies evolve, it becomes more difficult to de termine the circumstances under which copyrighted material may be utilized before copyrights are violated. Regardless, Jensen a sserts that individuals ignore copyright laws as inconsequential [2]. Articles have been published a bout copyright issues and the Internet with a presumption that because the content is available, people use it as they wish. However, they make no reference to proof of this claim. Researchers in the United States have surveyed students regarding pl agiarism of assignments and cheating on tests. These incide nces of plagiarism may be associated with copyright violations, but one can occur without affecting the other. Studies sp ecifically addressing copyright issues among university students are significantly lacking. Because the Internet is more frequently used for all sources of information, Scanlon and Neuma nn state that universities  X  X hould be concerned about the impact of the Internet in shaping a new generation of students X  concep tion of what does and does not constitute fair use of the countless texts so readily available X  online [4]. This study will indicate student awareness of the concept of fair use policy. It will also determine if students are aware of fair use policy, but choos e to ignore it as Jensen believes they will. During the summer of 2010, a survey will be developed and designed to discover student unders tanding of copyright laws and how this understanding affects us er experience on the Internet. The survey results will also provide an indication of the effectiveness of current IA curriculum. The Eastern Michigan University College of Technology Human Subjects Review Committee will review and approve questions prior to survey distribution. The survey will take place in the fall and data will be compiled in October. My completed poster will include a visual representation of significant re sults of several hypotheses. A Kantar Media study conducted in Great Britain found that half of the respondents who paid for legal online services also used illegal file sharing services [3]. This would seem to indicate that convenience and availability outweigh the legality of the activity. These results also imply that users either don X  X  understand the difference or they don X  X  believe it matters. My study will attempt to determine if this is the case by testing the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1: The ease of copyi ng material from the Internet encourages copyright violations. Jensen states that social norms require a property owner to protect property from the trespass of outsiders, as opposed to the outsider avoiding trespass of another X  X  property if it isn X  X  otherwise protected. For example, a wheat farmer fences his fields to keep out a neighboring rancher X  X  cattle, instead of the rancher fencing his land to make certain his cattle don X  X  trespass on the farmer X  X  fields [2]. Have social norms, such as the one described above, led to the belief that if something can be freely downloaded from the Internet it is in the public domai n and it is the copyright owner X  X  fault for making it available in this manner? This will be tested using the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 2: Students believe free Internet content is considered in the public domain and not subject to copyright. Shopping online for items such as textbooks requires determining the legality of the offer in addition to searching for the best deal. A student may be faced with the choice of paying $50 for a legitimate textbook download or downloading an identical version for free. Cash is always a student concern and the Internet provides the ability to make both textbook options available. Colleges have begun to pay licensi ng fees to allow students to access texts from specific sites, such as books24x7.com. The student doesn X  X  pay to use the service, but it is possible to use the site without understanding that the college has paid for it on the student X  X  behalf. The research required to determine the legality of an available download can be daunting and may not be a consideration during the shopping experience. My research will determine if students consider the owner X  X  copyrights of an online item or if cost and ease of access are the sole factors considered. Hypothesis 3: Students use the eas iest, least expensive method to obtain what they want from the Internet. Anyone using the Internet can become a publisher and/or distributor regardless of knowledge of copyright laws. It is difficult to track millions of poten tial publishers to verify that they are acting in a legal manner. It is also unreasonable to expect that anyone who decides to publish is knowledgeable of copyright law. This, coupled with a belief that copyright law is not enforceable with the digital technology available today, makes copyright violators difficult to identify. Sixty-one percent of those surveyed for the Kantar Media study believe this to be true [3]. My study will determine the extent of this belief among U.S. survey respondents. Hypothesis 4: Students believe copyright violations are difficult to track. Online courses may present more possibilities for unethical practices than do traditional courses. Students who lack motivation or time management skills may choose to plagiarize another X  X  work. Copying and pa sting Internet material is apparently the most common form of computer ethics violation among students [1]. The amount of information available on the Internet may make students feel that it is impossible for teachers to determine that the work is not original. This implies that students believe they will not ge t caught. Do students feel that sites, such as Turnitin.com, can be used effectively to determine if material is original? I will test this question with the final hypothesis: Hypothesis 5: Students believe th at the likelihood of being caught is minimal. Ultimately, education about copyright law will decrease the demand for pirated material. Expansi on of this research to include other universities will create a br oader understanding of student beliefs of copyright violations that will help educational institutions develop more effectiv e curriculum. This will ensure that future security specialists have the knowledge expected by employers to assist them in the struggle to protect intellectual property on the Internet.
