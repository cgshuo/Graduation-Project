INTRODUCTION With the exponential growth of information on the Internet, finding and or-ganizing relevant materials is becoming increasingly diffi cult. Internet direc-tories, such as Yahoo!, which classify Web pages into predefi ned hierarchical categories, provide one solution to the problem, that is, st ructured directo-ries support efficacy and efficiency in both browsing and sear ch, because pages (documents) are organized into hierarchical categories an d similar pages are grouped together. Categories in the hierarchical structur es are carefully de-fined by human experts, and documents are well organized. How ever, a single hierarchy in one language is often insufficient to find releva nt documents for all users and their information needs. Each hierarchy tends to have some bias in both defining hierarchical structure and classifying doc uments, for example, some hierarchies are coarse-grained hierarchies while oth ers are fine grained. guage often include large amounts of information related to the user X  X  request, while existing Web search engines only support the retrieva l of documents written in the same language as the query. In this article, we propose a method of integrating different category hierarchies X  X he Reuter s  X 96 hierarchy and the UDC code hierarchy of Mainichi Japanese newspaper docum ents X  X y es-timating category similarities. The method does not simply merge two differ-ent hierarchies into a large hierarchy but instead extracts sets of categories, where each category within the set is relevant to the others. The reason for extracting sets of categories is that each categorical hier archy is defined by individual human experts, and different linguists often id entify different num-bers of categories for the same concepts. Therefore, it is im possible to handle full integration of hierarchies. The method we propose here consists of three steps. First, we classify documents from one hierarchy into categories with an-other hierarchy using the cross-language text classificati on (CLTC) technique, and extract category pairs of the two hierarchies. Next, we a pply  X  2 statistics to these pairs in order to estimate similar category pairs. F inally, we apply the generating function (Apriori-Gen) of the Apriori algor ithm developed by Agrawal and Srikant [1998] to the extracted pairs, and gener ate sets of simi-lar categories.
 of cross-lingual relevant documents. Relevant documents are defined here as pairs of English and Japanese documents that report identic al or closely re-lated contents, for example, a pair of documents describing an aircraft crash and its ensuing investigation or plans to compensate the vic tims X  families or any safety measures proposed as a result of this crash. In the task of retriev-ing cross-lingual relevant documents, it is crucial to iden tify an event, some-thing that occurs at some specific place and time associated w ith some specific action [Allan 2002]. One solution for identifying events is to use a topic, that is, a category in the hierarchical structure such as Internet di rectories. Although a topic is not an event, 1 it can be a broader class of an event. Thus, if a hier-archy is a fine-grained rather than coarse-grained hierarch y, some documents that are similar to each other may be included in some categor y.
 with UDC code hierarchy. The Reuters corpus consists of many documents organized into coarse-grained categories. In contrast, th e documents of the Mainichi Japanese corpus (RWCP corpus) with UDC code are org anized into a fine-grained hierarchy. Therefore, we expect that the UDC hi erarchy will help to identify some specific event. However, the problem is that there are few doc-uments assigned to each category. As it is very expensive to a nnotate by hand, we postulated our system using the results of integrating di fferent hierarchies for retrieving relevant documents to be able to compensate f or each hierarchy lack of coverage. The retrieval results using Reuters and Ma inichi Japanese corpora showed a 42.7% improvement over the baseline nonhie rarchy model, and a 21.6% improvement over a single hierarchy. 2. RELATED WORK Ontology merging on the Internet is crucial to provide intel ligent Web services [Choi et al. 2006]. Noy et al. proposed a method to co mbine two ontolo-gies, which are represented in a hierarchical categorizati on [Noy and Musen 2000]. Their method is based on the similarity between words with dictionar-ies. Stumme presented a method that uses the attributes of co ncepts to merge different ontologies [Stumme and Madche 2001]. It creates a new concept with-out regard to the original concepts in both ontologies, alth ough these methods require human interaction for the merging process. Moreove r, the evaluation of the results of ontology merging is an open issue in these me thods. have been attempts to achieve semi-or fully automatic integ ration of different hierarchies. Much of the previous work applied machine lear ning (ML) tech-niques [Langley 1996] to classify each document into more th an one category. Naive Bayes (NB) [Mitchell 1997] is one of the ML techniques u sed for this type of document classification framework [Doan et al. 2002] . It is based on the assumption of word independence in a document, which mak es computa-tion of the NB classifiers far more efficient. However, the per formance is no better than that of SVMs and k nn [Yang and Lui 1999; Yang et al. 2003], as NB selects poor weights for the decision boundary when one cl ass has more training samples than another. Ichise et al. used Enhanced N aive Bayes (E-NB) [Agrawal and Srikant 2001] to integrate multiple Int ernet directories. They used the  X  -statistics to find similar category pairs, and transferred the document categorization from a category in the source Inter net directory to a 8: 4  X  F. Fukumoto and Y. Suzuki similar category in the target Internet directory. They did not rely on words or word similarity in a document but instead relied on the cat egory structure. They reported that the performance of their method was more t han 10% bet-ter with regard to accuracy than Agrawal and Doan X  X  methods [ Agrawal and Srikant 2001; Doan et al. 2002; Ichise et al. 2003]. However, Ichise et al. X  X  method is based on the existence of a large number of shared li nks. They re-ported that the performance was not better if there were fewe r shared links. Moreover, the method finds only one-to-one mapping categori es, while real-world Web directories have one-to-many or many-to-many map pings.
 not only for many NLP tasks, such as bilingual lexicon extrac tion and word sense disambiguation (WSD), but also for NLP applications, such as multi-lingual topic detection and tracking [Chen et al. 2004; Sun e t al. 2007]. The performance of these tasks depends on the quality and quanti ty of bilingual data, but it is very expensive to manually collect these data . Therefore, re-search on finding cross-lingual relevant-document pairs us ing bilingual com-parable corpora, consisting of sets of documents in two diff erent languages from the same period of dates, is very popular. Much of the pre vious work on finding cross-lingual relevant-document pairs used some me asure of document similarity between two languages. Documents written in one language are translated into another language using existing bilingual lexicons or machine translation (MT) systems. Document pairs are then retrieve d using some mea-sure of document similarity, which is based on word occurren ces. Collier et al. [1998] compared the performance of finding cross-lingually relevant-document pairs between measures of document similarity based on MT sy stems and those based on bilingual lexicons. They used English and Jap anese Reuters daily news articles in their experiments, and found that MT d oes not have a clear advantage over the dictionary term lookup model at all levels of recall. Masuichi et al. [2000] proposed applying a bootstrapping te chnique to an ex-isting corpus-based CLIR approach for the task of retrievin g bilingual text pairs. They used 1,000 English-Japanese bilingual patent t exts. With their bootstrapping method, the recall of the obtained pairs was 8 2.1% and the pre-cision was 99.2%, which were better than the results produce d by CLIR based on the vector space model with cosine similarity. Utsuro et a l. [2003] proposed a method for retrieving relevant English and Japanese docum ents based on the extraction of bilingual term correspondences from WWW n ews sites. They used 50 Japanese and English article pairs for the evaluatio n, and reported that Japanese articles with cosine similarity values above 0.4 had precision of around 40% or more. Utiyama et al. proposed a method for align ing bilingual news articles where a bilingual dictionary as well as statis tical measures were employed for article similarity calculation [Utiyama and I sahara 2003]. They used English and Japanese daily news articles in their exper iments, and found that the result of retrieving relevant documents was better than using a BM25 weighting method [Robertson and Hull 2000]. Zhu et al. explo red the relation-ship between translation quality and retrieval effectiven ess in MT-based CLIR [Zhu and Wang 2006]. They degraded a rule-based MT system by c hanging the size of both the rule base and the dictionary to investiga te MT systems of different translation quality. They reported that retri eval effectiveness de-pends on the translation quality of the queries, and found th at title queries are preferred for MT-based CLIR.

Resnik proposed a method for automatically finding parallel translated documents on the Web based on the structures of the HTML source texts [Resnik and Smith 2003]. The result, using English and French as a relevant language pair, showed 100% precision against 68.4% recall, with a yield of 293 documents.
 on the hierarchies from different languages, which have not been explored pre-viously in the context of integrating hierarchies. Second, we used lexical infor-mation of documents through CLTC, which we believe is import ant to take into account the documents X  contents. Third, we used a learn ing model, SVMs, which has been widely used in text classification but which ha s not been ex-plored in the context of integrating hierarchies. From the v iewpoint of retriev-ing relevant documents, we used category information of doc uments as well as statistical measures to improve the efficacy of relevant-do cument retrieval. 3. INTEGRATING HIERARCHIES Our goal was to integrate different category hierarchies by estimating category similarities. The procedure consisted of three steps: (1) C LTC, (2) estimating category correspondences, and (3) generating sets of simil ar categories. 3.1 Cross-Language Text Classification The corpora we used are the Reuters  X 96 and the RWCP corpus of t he Mainichi Japanese newspapers. In the CLTC task, we used English and Ja panese data to train the Reuters  X 96 categorical hierarchy and the Maini chi UDC code hier-archy, respectively. In the Reuters  X 96 hierarchy, the syst em was trained using labeled English documents, and classified translated label ed Japanese docu-ments. Similarly, for the Mainichi UDC code hierarchy, we tr ained the system using labeled Japanese documents, and classified translate d labeled English documents. Therefore, we used Japanese-English and Englis h-Japanese MT software.
 shown to be effective for text classification [Yang and Lui 19 99; Dumais and Chen 2000]. SVMs were introduced by Vapnik [Vapnik 1995] to s olve two-class ( x rates a set of positive examples from a set of negative exampl es. Here, x i is the i -th training samples, and y i is its class label, positive (+1) or negative (  X  1). The optimal hyperplane w  X  x + b , ( w , x  X  R n , b  X  R ) to separate them (where 8: 6  X  F. Fukumoto and Y. Suzuki w is the vector of learned weights and b is a decision threshold value) is found by solving the following optimization problem: where C is a parameter that controls the training errors, and become s the upper bound of  X  i . Support vectors are those training examples x i with  X  i &gt; 0 at the solution. Given a test sample x , its label y is decided by summing the inner products of the test sample and the training samples we ighted by  X  i : multiclass, multilabel classification problem. Several me thods intended for multiclass, multilabel data have been proposed [Weston and Watkin 1998]. We used the One-against-the-Rest version of the SVMs model a t each level of a hierarchy. We classified test documents using a hierarch y by learning separate classifiers at each internal node of the hierarchy. Similar to Dumais X  X  a decision threshold value of the i -th hierarchical level, and m is the number of hierarchical levels [Dumais and Chen 2000]. The process i s repeated by greedily selecting subbranches until a leaf is reached.
 egory M into Reuters categories using SVM classifiers. Similarly, e ach trans-lated Reuters document with category R was classified into Mainichi UDC categories. Figure 1 illustrates the classification of Reut ers and Mainichi docu-ments. In Figure 1, documents with UDC code categories M1 or M 22 are clas-sified into Reuters category R12, and documents with Reuters categories R1 or R2 are classified into Mainichi UDC category M21. As a result, we obtained Reuters and Mainichi category pairs, for example, (R12, M1) , (R12, M22), (M21, R1), and (M21, R2), from the documents assigned to the c ategories in each hierarchy. 3.2 Estimating Category Correspondences The second step in integrating different category hierarch ies is to estimate Reuters and UDC category correspondences. The assumption o f category cor-respondences is that semantically similar categories, suc h as Equity markets and Bond markets exhibit similar statistical properties than dissimilar ca t-egories, such as Equity markets and Sports . We applied  X  2 statistics to the results of CLTC. The  X  2 statistic measures the lack of independence between the two inputs. We used this measure, as it has shown to be effe ctive for many tasks, such as feature selection [Yang and Lui 1999; Dumais a nd Chen 2000] and bilingual term correspondence [Utsuro et al. 2003; Roga ti and Yang 2004]. Mainichi Japanese document with Mainichi UDC category M is assigned to Reuters category R . We can extract Reuters and Mainichi UDC category pairs. Then, based on the contingency table of co-occurrence frequ encies of M and R , which is shown in Table I, we can estimate category correspon dences according to the  X  2 statistics shown in Eq. (1). Here, the co-occurrence freque ncy of M and R is equal to the number of category M documents assigned to R . We can also, as we did with the Reuters hierarchy, estimate categor y correspondences from the Mainichi UDC hierarchy and, extract a pair ( M , R ) according to the  X  2 value. We note that the similarity obtained by each hierarch y does not have a fixed range. Thus, we apply the normalization strategy show n in Eq. (2) to the results obtained by each hierarchy to bring the similari ty value into the range [0 , 1]. 8: 8  X  F. Fukumoto and Y. Suzuki set of pairs by the Mainichi UDC code hierarchy. We construct the set of M of  X  2 is higher than a lower-bound L  X  2 , two categories, M and R , are regarded as similar. 2 3.3 Generating Sets of Similar Categories The final step to integrate different hierarchies is to gener ate sets of similar categories. We note that if we use all pairs with the value of  X  2 higher than a lower-bound, to find all sets of similar categories, this al gorithm will make as many passes over the data as the number of combinations of s ets, which is exponentially large. We thus used the generating functio n of the Apriori algorithm developed by Agrawal et al. [Agrawal and Srikant 1 998], which can discover association rules between items in a large databas e of transactions with high performance. 3 Figure 2 shows an algorithm for generating sets of similar categories.
 only, that is, all sets with supports above a user-defined thr eshold, minimum support ( min -sup in Figure 2). We used normalized  X  2 values, which are shown in Eq. (2), as minimum support. We note that C 2 in line 1 not only consists of the extracted category correspondences Set ( m , r ) , but also of a set of Mainichi UDC code category m p and its child category m c , Set ( m similar categories. The Apriori-Gen function in line 5 of Fi gure 2 takes as an argument L k , where each element consists of the number of k categories, and returns a superset such that each element of the superset con sists of k + 1 categories. The number of elements of L k does not have a fixed range. Thus, we use the normalization strategy, which is shown in Eq. (2). Lines 6, 7, and 8 in Figure 2 show Eq. (2) applied to each element of the set C k +1 . 3, p and q differ in that the last k -th elements are concatenated and make a new set c with k + 1 categories. In lines 5 to 9, the  X  2 value of the new set c is calculated, and c is stored in the set C k +1 in line 10. Lines 12 to 17 show the pruning phase, which deletes all candidates c  X  C k +1 such that some k -subset of c is not in L k . 4. APPLICATION TO DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL We applied the results of generating sets of similar categor ies extracted from the Reuters and Mainichi UDC code hierarchies to the task of r elevant-document retrieval to examine the effectiveness of the inte grating method. Recall that we used cross-language, that is, English and Jap anese documents with quite different hierarchical structures. The task thu s consists of two cri-teria: (1) retrieving relevant documents based on English ( we call this Inte-grating hierarchies &amp; Eng ) and (2) retrieving relevant document: based on Japanese ( Integrating hierarchies &amp; Jap ). Let d R i (1  X  i  X  s) be a Reuters document that is classified into the Reuters category R . Let d M j (1  X  j  X  t ) be a Mainichi document that belongs to the Mainichi category M . Here, s and t are the number of documents classified into the Reuters categ ory R and Mainichi category M , respectively. Each Reuters document d R i is translated into a Japanese document d R MT i by an MT system. Each Mainichi document d Integrating hierarchies &amp; Eng with a set of similar categories consisting of 8: 10  X  F. Fukumoto and Y. Suzuki R and M , for each Reuters and Mainichi document, we calculate cosin e similar-ities between each Reuters document and each translated Mai nichi document. If the similarity value between them is higher than a lower-b ound L  X  , we re-garded these documents as relevant documents. The procedur e is applied to all documents belonging to the sets of similar categories. Integrating hierar-chies &amp; Jap is the same as Integrating hierarchies &amp; Eng except for the 5. EXPERIMENTS 5.1 Integrating Hierarchies The Reuters  X 96 corpus from 20 Aug. 1996 to 19 Aug. 1997 consis ts of 806,791 documents organized into 126 categories with a four-level h ierarchy. The RWCP corpus labeled with UDC codes selected from 1994 Mainic hi news-papers consists of 27,755 documents organized into 9,951 ca tegories with a seven-level hierarchy [RWCP 1998]. We used Japanese-Engli sh and English-Japanese machine translation software (Internet Honyaku-no-Ousama for Linux, Version 5, IBM Corp.) for CLTC. We divided both Reuter s  X 96 (from 20 Aug. 1996 to 19 May 1997) and RWCP corpora into two equal set s: a train-ing set to train SVM classifiers, and a test set for TC to genera te sets of similar categories. We divided the test set into two parts: the first w as used to estimate thresholds, that is, a decision threshold b used in CLTC, lower-bound L  X  2 , and minimum support; and the second was used to generate sets of s imilar cate-gories using these thresholds. We chose b = 0 for each level of a hierarchy. The lower-bound L  X  2 and minimum support were 0 . 005 and 1%, respectively. These threshold values were determined as follows: we divid ed the first set of test data into three subsets, and chose b and L  X  2 values that maximized the average F1-score [Rijsbergen et al. 1998] among them, and mi nimum support that maximized the number of correct sets of similar categor ies among the topmost 2,000 sets. 4 We selected 109 categories from Reuters and 4,739 cat-egories from Mainichi UDC, which have at least five documents in each set. All Japanese documents were tagged by the morphological ana lysis system ChaSen [Matsumoto et al. 2000]. English documents were tagg ed using a part-of-speech tagger developed by Schmid [1995]. We used nouns f or both English and Japanese documents, and represented each document as a v ector of nouns with frequency weights in the experiments.
 F1-score. Here, F1-score (F1) is a measure that balances pre cision (Prec) and recall (Rec), that is, F1 = 2  X  Prec  X  Rec within  X  3 days. The precise definitions of the precision and recall of the task are given as: with L  X  2 = 0 . 005. We compared the results obtained by our method, that is, hierarchical approach (Hierarchy in Table II) to those o btained by the flat nonhierarchical approach (Flat in Table II). In the hierarc hical approach, the MT system learned SVM models to distinguish each category fr om only those categories within the same level. In the flat nonhierarchica l approach, the MT system learned models to distinguish each category from a ll other cate-gories. Moreover, in the hierarchical approach, we applied a Boolean function to each test document. Mai &amp; Reu in Table II shows the results o btained by our method. Mai and Reu show the results using only one hierarchy , UDC code, and Reuters, respectively. Mai shows the results in which th e Mainichi docu-ment and translated Reuters document were classified into ca tegories with the Mainichi hierarchy, and it shows estimated category corres pondences. Simi-larly, Reu refers to the results in which the Reuters documen t and translated Mainichi document were classified into categories with the R euters hierarchy. 8: 12  X  F. Fukumoto and Y. Suzuki effective than using only a single hierarchy. Moreover, we f ound advantages in the F1-score for the hierarchical approach in comparison with a baseline flat nonhierarchical approach, as the F1-score of the former was 0.482, while that of the latter was 0.422. Therefore, we report the result s obtained by the hierarchical approach in the following experiments.
 curves for each method. Figure 5 illustrates precision/rec all by three methods against changes in the L  X  2 value. The best result was obtained by integrating hierarchies and showed that lower-bound L  X  2 values above 0.005 have preci-sion of around 50% or more, and those under 0.005 have recall o f around 50% or more. The result achieved with Mai was worse than that with Reu. One reason is the accuracy of TC: the microaverage F1-score of TC for the Reuters hierarchy was 0.815, while that of the Mainichi hierarchy wa s 0.673, as the Mainichi hierarchy consists of many categories, and the num bers of training data for each category were smaller than those of Reuters. Mc Callum et al. [1998] used a technique called shrinkage, which is especial ly useful for cate-gories with small numbers of training documents, and which i s a rich space for further exploration.
 L  X  2 = 0.005 are shown in Figure 6. As Figure 6 shows the results sup port the usefulness of  X  2 statistics in each method, as the rate of containing correct category pairs tends to decrease as the order of category pai rs sorted by a nor-malized  X  2 value becomes lower. Moreover, the results obtained by our m ethod showed that 184 category pairs that were judged as correct we re contained in the topmost 200 category pairs according to the  X  2 statistics. In contrast, the results obtained by our method were lower than those obtaine d by the other two methods when the order of category pairs was larger than 2 ,001: the to-tal number of category pairs obtained by our method was 2,137 in all, while those obtained using only the Reuters hierarchy and RWCP hie rarchy was large X 28,269 and 15,268, respectively X  X nd some correct ca tegory pairs were contained among them. We used the results of category pairs w ith L  X  2 = 0 . 005 to generate sets of similar categories.
 gories for the order of the sets sorted by normalized  X  2 value (min-sup = 1%). The overall results for each method were better than those of category pairs, especially because with our method, 193 of the topmost 200 se ts were judged to be correct. Recall that we used the Apriori algorithm to gene rate sets of simi-lar categories. To examine how the ratio of minimum support o f Apriori affects the overall performance of our method, we used different min imum supports. Table III shows the total number of sets with more than two cat egories for each ratio of minimum support, and Figure 8 shows the results.
 ratio on the effectiveness for extracting sets with more tha n two categories. There were no differences among minimum support ratios, as t he ratio of con-taining correct category sets was over 96% within the top 200 , and 65% within the top 2,000 according to the  X  2 values. On the other hand, it is clear from 8: 14  X  F. Fukumoto and Y. Suzuki Figure 8 that the minimum support ratio is extremely sensiti ve to the ratio of correct sets of categories when the number of sets is larger t han 2,001. 5.2 Relevant-Document Retrieval hierarchies, we applied the results to the task of relevant-document retrieval. The training data for choosing the lower-bound L  X  used in relevant-document extraction was from Reuters and RWCP from 13 to 21 June 1997. T he dif-ference in dates between RWCP and Reuters was less than  X  3 days. 5 For example, when the date of the RWCP document was 18 June, the co rrespond-ing Reuters date was from 15 to 21 June. We chose L  X  that maximized the average F1-score among them. The test data sets we used for re trieving relevant-documents were Reuters and RWCP from 22 to 30 June. Table IV shows the total number of collected documents and the number of related doc-uments collected manually for the evaluation. In Table IV, J ap  X  Eng (  X  3) shows the range of dates; the difference in dates was less tha n  X  3 days. Total # of relevant doc. refers to the number of documents collecte d manually for the evaluation. Note that the total number of Mainichi document s was sometimes lower than that of relevant-documents. This was because one Japanese docu-ment was retrieved as a pair of related documents with more th an one English documents. The classification was determined to be correct i f the two human judges agreed on the evaluation.
 8: 16  X  F. Fukumoto and Y. Suzuki compared these results with those obtained by our methods, Integrating hi-erarchies &amp; Eng and Integrating hierarchies &amp; Jap .

Prec denotes precision, which is the ratio of correct relevant documents found by the MT system divided by the total number of the system X  X  assignmen ts. Rec shows recall, which is the ratio of correct relevant documents fou nd by the system divided by the total number of correct assignments. F1-scor e combines recall and precision with equal weights. As can be seen clearly from Table V, the results with integrating hierarchies improved overall per formance; relevant documents based on English performed especially well: the F 1-score by the Integrating hierarchies &amp; Eng approach was 42.7% better than the base-line nonhierarchy model (No hi &amp; Eng), and 21.6% better than a single hierar-chy (Reu Hierarchy).

 model (No hi &amp; Eng) was much greater than that of the integrating hierar -chies (Int hi &amp; Eng) model at all L  X  values. This is because pairs were re-trieved by using only the cosine similarity. Therefore, man y of the document pairs retrieved did not have closely related contents, even if L  X  was set to a higher value than that in the integrating hierarchies metho d. For example, the Reuters document concerning  X  X lbanian parties poised f or early general election X  and the Mainichi document concerning  X  X DP, SDP an d Sakigake dis-cuss Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines X  were retr ieved because they are closely related. As a result, the nonhierarchy approach has poorer pre-cision (0.247) than the integrating hierarchies approach ( 0.692). However, these documents were not retrieved by the integrating-hier archies approach because  X  X lbanian election X  is classified into the Reuters c ategory  X  X lection, X  and  X  X apan X  X  politics X  is classified into the Mainichi categ ory  X  X nternational policy/politics, X  and they are not grouped together in esti mating similar categories.
 8: 18  X  F. Fukumoto and Y. Suzuki while that of the integrating hierarchies approach (Int hi &amp; Eng) was 0.773 at the same L  X  value (0.35), as shown in Table V. The number of document pairs judged correctly to be relevant by the single hierarch y approach was 869, while that by the integrating hierarchies approach was 1,189. This is because in the single hierarchy (Reu Hierarchy) method, som e of the trans-lated Mainichi documents were not correctly classified into categories with the Reuters hierarchy. For example,  X  X ashimoto remarks on fx ra tes X  in Mainichi documents should be classified into the Reuters category  X  X o rex markets, X  but it was classified into  X  X overnment. X  As a result,  X  X .S. Treas ury has no com-ment on Hashimoto fx remarks X  in the Reuters category  X  X orex markets X  and the document  X  X ashimoto remarks on fx rates X  were not retrie ved by a single hierarchy approach. In contrast, in the integrating method , these two docu-ments were classified correctly into a pair of similar catego ries, that is, the  X  X .S. Treasury X  document was classified into the Reuters cat egory  X  X orex mar-kets X  using Reuters training data, and the  X  X ashimoto remar ks of fx rates X  document was classified into the Mainichi category  X  X oney an d banking X  us-ing Mainichi training data. These observations show that th e integrating-hierarchies approach contributed to the retrieval of relev ant documents. used in this study. As shown in the figure, F1-scores of the thr ee approaches based on the Japanese data were worse than those of the approa ches using English data except for L  X  values of Mai and Reu below 0.10. These results indicate that (1) using more training data for CLTC improves overall perfor-mance, and (2) when the number of documents translated into a different lan-guage is small, it is better to carry out similarity comparis ons, rather than when the number of documents translated into a different lan guage is large. This is due to the MT system for CLTC; the number of words in the English-Japanese dictionary of the MT system is larger than that in th e Japanese-English dictionary. 6 However, it suffers from frequent failure due to the bilingual vocabulary X  X  incompleteness in the English-Jap anese dictionary, such as the time-sensitive bilingual vocabulary, including nam es of people, places, and organizations. To solve this problem, it is necessary to use bilingual lexi-cons extracted from corpora, together with the bilingual di ctionary. of relevant documents against changes in L  X  . As shown in Figure 10, the best performance was obtained when we used Integrating hierarchies &amp; Eng , that is, Prec (Eng) and Rec (Eng) curves showed that English d ocuments with similarity values above 0.35 had precision of around 65% or m ore, and those below 0.35 had recall of around 77% or more. These results aga in support our claim on the usefulness of integrating hierarchies in re trieving relevant documents. 6. CONCLUSIONS We addressed the issue of a single hierarchy and proposed a me thod for in-tegrating cross-language category hierarchies, the Reute rs  X 96 hierarchy and 8: 20  X  F. Fukumoto and Y. Suzuki the UDC code hierarchy in Japanese, by estimating category s imilarities. The results of category correspondences obtained by the integr ating-hierarchies method was better than using only one hierarchy, either the U DC code hierar-chy or the Reuters  X 96 hierarchy, and showed that L  X  2 values above 0.005 had precision of around 50% or more, and those under 0.005 had rec all of around 50% or more. The results obtained by the integrating-hierar chies approach showed that 184 category pairs judged as correct were contai ned in the topmost 200 category pairs according to the  X  2 statistics, and the percentage correct at-tained reached 92%. Moreover, the overall results of sets of similar categories obtained by three methods X  X ntegrating hierarchies, UDC co de hierarchy, and Reuters  X 96 hierarchy X  X ere better than those of category pa irs; especially, in the integrating-hierarchies approach, 193 of the topmost 2 00 sets were judged to be correct, and the percentage attained was 96.5%.

 tained by our method depend on the performance of TC. Therefo re, we may be able to obtain further advantages in effectiveness in the classification. For example, it will be necessary to examine some semisupervise d learning tech-niques, such as, co-training to improve classification accu racy.
 the English-Japanese dictionary of the MT system was larger than that of the Japanese-English dictionary. However, the method suffere d from frequent fail-ure of bilingual vocabulary in the English-Japanese dictio nary, and as a result, when the number of documents translated into a different lan guage was large, it was better not to carry out similarity comparisons, rathe r than when the number of documents translated into a different language wa s small. Another option would be to use bilingual lexicons extracted from cor pora, together with the bilingual dictionary. It will be worthwhile attempting this with our method in future studies. Moreover, we applied  X  2 statistics to estimate category corre-spondences. However, investigating other criteria, such a s mutual information and log-likelihood ratio, may improve overall performance .
 documents was based on the assumption that relevant results from a search would be documents with similar lexical properties. Theref ore, it will be nec-essary to compare the results of retrieving relevant docume nts between our approach and a standard IR system using a BM25 weighting meth od [Robert-son and Hull 2000] to demonstrate the effectiveness of our me thod. in the same language as the query, while the Web consists of do cuments in various languages covering different temporal spans. The g oal of our research is to improve the efficiency and efficacy of retrieving docume nts on the Web. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the method using Inte rnet directories. Moreover, the method should be expanded so that it can be appl ied to more than three hierarchies. This is a rich space for further inve stigation. 8: 22  X  F. Fukumoto and Y. Suzuki
