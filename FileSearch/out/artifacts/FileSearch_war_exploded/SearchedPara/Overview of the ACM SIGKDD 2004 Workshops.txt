 Following a tradition of several years, KDD conferences host a number of workshops on challenging topics that emerge and demand concerted research activities and intensive shar-ing of experiences. This short paper an one-glance overview of the 8 workshops that took place at August 22, 2004 be-fore the official opening of KDD 2004 in Seattle. The in-dividual workshop reports follow in the next pages. Com-plete information on the workshops including links to the individual sites can be found from the KDD 2004 web site http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigkdd/kdd2004 . The 10th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowl-edge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2004) featured on August 22 a rich program of 8 workshops and 6 tutorials. The 8 workshops, accepted among 12 submissions, were as follows: The 4th Workshop on Data Mining in Bioinformatics (BIOKDD04) was organized by Mohammed Zaki (Rensse-laer Polytechnic Institute), Shinichi Morishita (Univ. Tokyo) and Isidore Rigoutsos (IBM T.J. Watson Research Center). The workshop featured 6 long and 4 short papers in four ses-sions and one keynote invited talk by Mark Boguski (Allen Institute for Brain Science / Univ. Washington).  X  KDD 2004 Workshops Chair The 6th International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery from the Web (WEBKDD 2004) was organized by Bamshad Mobasher (DePaul Univ.), Bing Liu (Univ. Illinois, Chicago), Brij Masand (Data Miners, Inc.) and Olfa Nasraoui (Univ. Louisville). This year X  X  focus was on Web mining and usage analysis. The workshop had 10 papers, accommodated in four sessions, the last of which was devoted to mining issues common to the Web and to the Semantic Web. This session run jointly with the MSW 2004 workshop and closed with a discussion on future research issues for Web mining and Semantic Web mining.
 The International Workshop on Mining for and from the Se-mantic Web (MSW-2004) was organized by Andreas Hotho (Univ. Kassel), York Sure (Univ. Karlsruhe) and Lise Getoor (Univ. Maryland). The workshop featured 9 papers and one invited talk by Alon Halevy (Univ. Washington) on the min-ing of structures for the prediction of semantics. The last of the workshop X  X  four sessions was joint with the WEBKDD 2004 workshop. I am deeply indebted to the KDD 2004 General Chair, Ronny Kohavi (Amazon.com) and the Program Committee Chairs Johannes Gehrke (Cornell University) and William DuMouchel (AT&amp;T Labs) for honoring me with the role of the Work-shops Chair and for supporting me with valuable comments throughout the process. Planning and coordinating the ac-tivities for the workshops day, from the moment of launch-ing the call for proposals until the 22nd of August 2004 required a close interaction with Mihael Ankherst (Boeing), the Tutorials Chair. I would like to thank him for the ex-cellent cooperation. Cordial thanks go also to Charu Ag-garwal (IBM T.J. Watson Research Center), the KDD 2003 Workshops Chair, for many precious comments, feedback and dissemination of lessons learned. The selection of the 8 approved workshops among 12 competent submissions has been a difficult one and I would like to thank the colleagues that have assisted me in the reviewing process. I am further indebted to the Publicity Chair, Gabor Melli (Prediction-Works) for the intensive work in promoting the workshops to the KDD audience and establishing a uniform and attrac-tive online presence for the workshops day. The concerted action of publishing the proceedings of all workshops in a uniform layout is the result of an excellent cooperation with the Local Arrangements Chair Ying Li (Microsoft) and her colleague Teresa Mah (Microsoft), the Proceedings Chair Joydeep Ghosh (Univ. Texas at Austin) and the Public-ity Chair Gabor Melli (PredictionWorks). The coordinated treatment of all expected and unexpected issues would not have been possible without the engagement of the whole Local Arrangements team of Ying Li (Microsoft) and of the Registration Chair Marina Meila (Univ. Washington). Fi-nally, my most heartful thanks are for the organizers of the 8 workshops for all their effort and involvement in making the workshops day a great success.
