 Data Science is an increasingly popular area of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. L eading consumer Web companies such as Amazon, Facebook, eBay, Google and LinkedIn, as well as B2B companies like Salesforce, possess Petabytes of data. Through effective mining of this data, they create products and services that benefit millions of users and generate tremendous amount of business valu e. It is widely acknowledged products, from pattern identification, idea generation and product decisions. Nonetheless, they also face common challenges, such as the gap between creating a prototype and turning it into a scalable product, or the frustration of generating innovative product ideas that do not get adopted. Organizers of this tutorial have many years of experience leading Data Science teams in some of the most successful consumer Web companies. In this tutorial, we introduce the framework that we created to nurture data-driven product innovations. The core of this framework is the focus on scale and impact -we take the audience through a discussion on how to balance between velocity and scale, between pr oduct innovation and product operation, and between theoretical research and practical impact. We also share some guidelines for successful data-driven product innovation with real examples from our experiences. We end the tutorial by discussi ng the organizational perspective of data-driven product innovation: how to structure Data Science teams so Data Scientists collaborate effectively with other functions, and how to hire and gr ow talents into Data Scientist roles. K.6.1 [ Management of Computing and Information Systems ]: Project and People Management  X  life cycle, staffing, strategic information systems planning, systems analysis and design Management, Measurement, Experimentation Data Science; Data Product; Innovation The total duration of the tutorial is 1.5 hours. The topics to be covered are: 1. Introduction (15 minutes) 2. Data-driven product innovati on framework (40 minutes) 3. Case Studies (20 minutes) 4. Talents (15 minutes) We welcome all participants of KDD 2015 to attend this tutorial, but we believe it will be most beneficial for Da ta Scientists working in product environments (Web or Mobile), Data Mining practitioners who are interested in a career transition to Data scale. Students considering industry jobs in Data Science may also find this tutorial valuable. Becoming a Data Scientist is one of the most popular career choices for students with quantitative backgrounds, not only from some of the more "mainstream" Data Mining programs in statistics an d computer science, but also increasingly from more diverse backgrounds such as physics, computational biology, economics, and social sciences. Giving them exposure to real life examples of i ndustry practices should help them make informed career choices. As one of the first tutorials on this topic in a KDD conference, it complements other tutorial topics which often focus on theories of knowledge discovery and data mi ning, or focus on teaching specific technologies to build data products. We believe that as experienced or aspiring Data Scientists within the KDD community grow interested in more applied roles, they will benefit from tutors with real in dustry experience and the lessons learned through the process of bringing ideas into reality.
