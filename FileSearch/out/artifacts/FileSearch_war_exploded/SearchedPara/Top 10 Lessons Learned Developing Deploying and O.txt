 The number of online services providing users with real-time recommendations has increased exponentially over the last few y ears. Recommender Systems that were originally only accessible to a limited number of high-tech companies are now widely available through a growing number of both technical choices and vendors. The accep tance however, of automatically delivered recommendations by users depends on numerous fact ors that go far beyond the algorithms that constitute the major focus of researchers. This ta lk will share a number of lessons learned over the last ten years creating and operating recommender systems in a multitude of domains, from digital music to fitness plans through personal finance management, and in a multitude of business settings, from lightweight integrations to high ly-coupled integrations within secure bank environments.
