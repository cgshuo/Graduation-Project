 Cross-domain recommender systems aim to generate or enhance personalized recommendations in a target domain by exploiting knowledge (mainly user preferences) form other source domains. This may beneficial for generating better recommendations, e.g. mitigating the cold-start and sparsity problems in a target dom ain, and enabling personalized cross-selling for items from multiple domains. In this tutorial, we formalize the cross-domain recommendation problem, categorize and survey state of the art cross-domain recommender systems, discuss related evaluation issues, and outline future rese arch directions on the topic.

For instance, Netflix recommends movies and TV programs, and Last.fm recommends songs and music albums. These domain-specific systems have been successfully deployed by numerous websites, and the single -domain recommendation functionality is not perceived as a limitation but rather pitched a s a focus on a certain market. Large e-commerce sites like Amazon and eBay, however, often store user feedback for items from multiple domains, and in soc ial networks users often provide feedback for a variety of topics. It may, therefore, be beneficial to leverage all the available use r data provided in various domains and systems, in order to generate m ore encompassing user models and better recommendations. Instead of treating each domain or item type independently, knowledge acquired in a source domain could be exploited in another, target domain. The research challenge of transferring the knowledge, and the business potential of deliver ing recommendations spanning across multiple domains, have triggered an increasing interest in the so-called cross-domain recommender systems. In the literature authors have considered several notions of domains. For instance, some have treated items like movies and books as belonging to different domains, while others have considered items such as action movies and comedy movies as distinct domains. In the tutorial , we discuss different definit ions of domain according to the attri butes and types of recommended items, distinguishing between four levels, namely (i) item attribute, (ii) item type, (iii) item, and (iv) system level. W e also consider the type of user feedback, evaluation scale, and conte xt used by the recommender to explain the notion of domain. The research on cross-domain recommendation generally aims to exploit knowledge from a source domain  X   X  to perform or improve recommendations in a target domain  X   X  . Let  X   X  be their sets of users, and let  X   X  and  X   X  be their sets of items. The users of a domain are those who expressed preferences (ratings, reviews, tags, or consumption logs) for the domain items. The items of a domain do not necessari ly have preferences from user s of the domain, but may have content-based features that establi sh their belonging to the domain. Analyzing the literature, we observe that the addressed tasks are diverse, and a consensual definition of the cross-domain recommendation problem has not been formulated yet. Sorted in in creasing order of complexity, we distinguish between the following three recommendation tasks: x Multi-domain recommendation : recommend items in both x Linked-domain recommendation : recommend items in the x Cross-domain recommendation : recommend items in the In the tutorial, we detail th e above recommendation tasks. The cross-domain recommendation problem has been addressed from various perspectives in different research areas. It has b een faced by means of user preference aggregation and mediation strategies for the cross-system personalization problem in user modeling [1][2][8], as a potential solution to mitigate the cold-start and sparsity problems in recommender systems [3][9][10], and as a practical application of knowledge transfer in machine learning [5][6][7]. This has entailed the development of a wide array of approaches, which in many cases are difficult to compare due to e.g., the user preferences they use, the cross-domain scenarios they deal with, and the algorithms on which they are based. In the tutorial, we discuss different categories of cross-domai n recommendation techniques propose d in the literature. Then, aim ing to reconcile these categories in a way that captures and unifie s their core ideas, we present a categorization focused on the exploita tion of knowledge in cross-domain recommendation, which dictates the following two-level taxonomy: Aggregating knowledge . Knowledge from various source domains is aggregated to per form recommendations in a target domain. Three use cases are considered: x Merging user preferences : the aggregated knowledge x Mediating user modeling data : the aggregated knowledge x Combining recommendations : the aggregated knowledge is Linking and transferring knowledge . Knowledge linkage or transfer between domains is established to support recommendations. Three variants are considered: x Linking domains : linking domains by a common x Sharing latent features : the source and target domains are x Transferring rating patterns : explicit or implicit rating Whether a cross-domain recommender system is good or bad cannot be evaluated without taking into account for what it is intended. The nature of the evaluation must be connected to the purpose for which the recommendations are required. Thus, in the tutorial. we first describe the cross-domain recommendation goals addressed in the literature: x Addressing the new user problem . This may be solved by x Addressing the new item problem . This is particularly x Improving accuracy . Data collected outside the target x Improving diversity . The diversity of recommendations can x Enhancing user models . The main goal of cross-domain Based on these goals, in the tutorial we discuss evaluation scenarios , methodologies and metrics . One interesting issue that deserves more attention in future wo rk is the synergy between cross-domain and context-aware recommendations : different contexts (e.g. location, time, and mood) can be treated as different domains, and context can be treated as a bridge between different domains. Another important issue concerns the evaluation metrics adopted. A common practice with cross-domain recommender systems is to evaluate their relevance through prediction metri cs such as MAE and RMSE. However, the true advantage of cross-domain recommendations is not nece ssarily in their accuracy, bu t rather in their novelty and diversity, which may lead to a high er satisfaction and utility for the user. A third open research issue refers to the usage of cross-domain recommender systems for reducing the user model elicitation effort. Cross-domain recommender systems could be used as alternative elicitation tools able to build detailed user profi les without or mitigating the need to collect explicit user prefere nces in cold-start situations.
