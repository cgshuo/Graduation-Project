 Information retrieval, Indexing, Dempster!Shafer th eory, Term dependency,Chinese. Current Information Retrieval (IR) approaches usual ly assume independencebetweenterms:Adocumentisrepresent edbyaset ofindependentterms,soisaquery.Forexample,a documentora query about  X  X omputer architecture X  is represented by two independentterms X  computer and architecture .Itisobviousthat inthissimplerepresentation,thestrongdependenc ybetweenthe termsvanishedandthemeaningof X  X omputerarchite cture X  X snot representedprecisely.Theproblemsrelatedtothe independence assumptionarewelldocumentedinIRliterature[5] [11][18]. To solve the problems, a common approach proposed i n the literatureistocreatemultipletypesofindex[5] ,usingbothsingle! word terms and multi!word terms. For the above exam ple, one would arrive at two possible representations: by computer and architecture ,andbythecompoundterm computer-architecture .In so doing, the document can match a query about computer or architecture due to the first type of index, and a query about computer architecture more strongly due to the second type of index.
 Althoughtheapproachoffersaremedytothepracti calproblemof mismatch to some degree, it does not solve the fund amental problemconcerningtherelationshipbetweendiffere ntterms X  X he two types of index were still used as independent p ieces of evidence.Inreality, computer ofthefirsttypeisstronglyrelated to computer-architecture ofthesecondtype.
 The importance to take into account the relationshi ps between termsinIRiswidelyrecognized,andanumberofi nvestigations havebeencarriedoutonit[8][16][17]usingdiffe rentframeworks rangingfromlanguagemodeling,Bayesiannetworkto Dempster! Shafer theory. We observe that any of the proposed methods encountered a crucial problem in implementation for the estimation of probabilities of different terms. In general, probabilities (or any other weights) are assigned t o terms accordingtotheirfrequenciesofoccurrences.Howe ver,whenwe observeanoccurrenceofthestring X  X omputerarchi tecture X  X na document, shouldweconsideritastheoneforthe compound term computer-architecture , for the single terms computer and architecture ,orforboth? Differentmethodshavebeenusedtodealwiththis problem.For example, [5][16] considered the occurrence simultan eously for bothcompoundandsingleterms.Thiswillinfactd uplicatethe occurrence,oneforthecompoundterm,andanother forsingle terms.Thisobviouslyfalsifiesthefinalprobabili tyestimationand enhancescompoundtermsunduly.Forexample,inthe occurrence  X  X omputer architecture and network X ,  X  X omputer arch itecture X  will be assigned an overly enhanced importance comp ared to  X  X etwork X  X uetotheconsiderationofbothcompound andsimple termsforit.
 Anothertypicalapproachistoconsidertheoccurre nceonlyfor single terms, and the probability of the compound t erm is estimatedafterwardsfromthoseofthesingleterms [1].Inthis case, however, it is implicitly assumed that an occ urrence of  X  X rchitecture X  X r X  X rchitecture X  X loneimpliessome how computer-architecture .Thisisobviouslynotalwaystrue,andagenerali zed assumptioncanleadtoawrongprobabilityestimati on. TheaboveproblemisfundamentalinIRtheory.Howe ver,ithas not been paid due attention in previous research in European languages. Part of the reason is that the considera tion of compound terms in addition to single terms is just an option, becausewordscanalreadycapturemostofthedocum entcontents. The addition of compound terms can sometimes improv e the retrievaleffectiveness.However,inmanyEastAsia nlanguages (Chinese, Japanese), the above problem is omniprese nt: these languagesdonothaveapropernativedefinitionof thenotionof word. The current indexing process usedinthesela nguagesis inheritedfromtheIRstudiesinEuropeanlanguages ,inwhich wordisaclearlinguisticnotion.Forcingtousew ordsasindexing unitsinAsianlanguageswillhidetheseveralimpo rtantproblems: ! Word segmentation is often ambiguous. For the same ! Words in Asian languages strongly overlap. In Asian Onemayarguethattheseproblemsofambiguousand overlapping terms also exist in European languages, e.g. when c onsidering compoundtermsorwhendealingwithlanguagessuch asGerman. However, the difference is theextenttowhichthe phenomena spreadintheselanguages:InChinese(andseveral otherAsian languages),thephenomenaaregeneralized!almost everyword formedbytwoormorecharacterscanbeviewedasj uxtaposition of two or more concepts. The consideration of multi ple and dependent terms in Asian languages is thus a fundam ental questionratherthananoption.
 InpreviousstudiesonChineseIR,remedialapproac hessimilarto [5][16] have been used (e.g. [10][6]). For example, one can segmentasentenceintoallthepossible(longand short)words andthencountthemindependently.However,thesea pproaches donotofferaradicalsolutiontotheproblem.
 Inthispaper,weproposeadifferentapproachtoc onsiderstrongly dependentterms.WewilluseDempster!Shafertheory [4][14]to groupmultipletermsimpliedinthesameoccurrence ofastring. Forexample,whenanoccurrenceof  X  X  X  (network)isobserved, weconsideritasrepresentingthreepossibleterms :  X  X  X  ,  X  and  X  .Thisoccurrenceisrepresentedasasetofterms, or term set , {  X  X  X  ,  X  ,  X  }, as in Dempster!Shafer theory of evidence. Probabilityisassignedtothewholetermsetinste adoftoeachof the terms. This will avoid the problem of duplicati ng the occurrence for long terms. In this representation, terms in the samesetareassumedtobedependent,butthedepen dencyisnot explicitlyrepresented.Thedependencywillbecons ideredinthe queryevaluationphase:Todeterminethescoreofa document facingaquery,wewillconsiderthepossiblerelat ionsbetweena termsetofthedocumentandatermsetofthequer y.Thiswill extend the beliefandplausibilityfunctionsofDempster!S hafer theory and allow us to define more appropriate eval uation functionsforIR.
 Our utilization of Dempster!Shafer theory aims to s olve the fundamental problem ofdocumentandqueryrepresent ationby dependentterms.Thisisdifferentfrompreviousut ilizationsofthe theory,whichoftenexploitedthetheoryforcombin ingmultiple piecesofevidenceassumedtobeindependent[12][1 3][19]. This approach is tested on several Chinese test col lections from TRECandNTCIR,andweobtainsignificantlybetter effectiveness thanthestate!of!the!artapproaches.
 Intheremainingofthepaper,wewillfirstdescri besomerelated studiestryingtodealwithdependenciesbetweente rms.Thenwe willdescribeourapproachusingDempster!Shaferth eory.Wewill describeourexperimentsonseveralChinesetestco llections.An analysiswillbemadeontheresultsbeforedrawing theconclusions. Single!word terms are found to be ambiguous in many cases. Therefore, compound terms or phrases have been used to complement the single!word terms. For example, one can first identifiescompoundtermsorphrasesusingbothsta tisticaland linguistic analyses, then combine them with single! word terms [5]. A typical approach is to define two retrieval scores, respectivelyfromsingle!wordtermsandfrommulti! wordterms. Thetwoscoresarethencombinedtoproduceafinal score.This approachhasshownsomeimprovementsinretrievale ffectiveness insomecases,buttheimprovementsareusuallysma llandnot consistentacrossstudies.
 Onecanobservethattheabovecombinationapproach doesnot reallyconsiderthetightrelationshipbetweensing le!wordterms andcompoundterms.Inordertocopewiththestron grelationship betweenthem,Camposetal.[1]proposedaBayesian networkto representthepossiblerelationshipsbetweendiffer entterms.Each nodeinthenetworkrepresentsatermandalinkbe tweennodes represents their dependency. The model can be seen as an extensionofthemodelproposedbyTurtleandCroft [17],but[1] triestorelaxtheconstraintimposedin[17],that termsinthesame layer of the network are independent. Although the model described in [1] can integrate, in theory, any type of relation betweentermsinthenetwork,thekeyissueisthe difficultyto estimate the dependencies between terms and to assi gn probabilitiestoterms.Infact,toimplementthem odel,Camposet al. had to heavily simplify the model and the proba bility of a compoundtermissimplyestimatedfromthoseofthe constituent termsconsideredalone.Thisimplementationfailst oreflectthe initialideaoftermdependencies.
 TheBayesiannetworkproposedbyTuttleandCroft[ 17]hasalso beenusedtoconsiderbothsingle!wordtermsandph rases[3].In this case, theyareconsideredtoformtwoindepend entsetsof terms.
 In[8],Metzlerconsideredtermrelationshipswithi nthelanguage modelingframework.Inhisapproach,differenttype sofrelation areassumedbetweentermsinaset(e.g.anounphr ase),varying fromstrictordertomoreflexibleproximityrelati ons.However, therelationshipsareonlyconsideredbetweenterms inaquery, and when documents are indexed, single!word terms a re still assumedtobeindependentwhenestimatingtheirpro babilities. In[9]termdependenciesareintegratedintoabigr amlanguage model,butthedependenciesarerestrictedtoatre eform,andthey areestimatedlooselyfromtermco!occurrencesind ocuments. Several approaches have been developed using vector space model. Wong et al. [18] proposed a generalized vect or space model, which uses logical conjunctions of terms as new dimensions in a new vector space. However, this met hod will greatlyincreasethecomplexityofthemodel,makin gitintractable inpractice.P X ssasetal.[11]followedasimilar directionusing term sets. Term sets group terms that co!occur freq uently in documents.Thesesetsareusedtoreplacethetradi tionaltermsin vectorspacemodel.However,norelationshipbetwee ntermsetsis considered.
 Theabovereviewshowsacriticalprobleminthecu rrentpractice in IR: terms and term sets are usually considered t o be independent.Thisisparticularlyapparentinthei ndexingprocess when terms are assigned probabilities within a docu ment: Occurrences within the document are counted separat ely. However,inreality,whenatermoccursinadocume nt,itoften impliestheoccurrenceofsomeotherterms.Thisis particularly thecaseinChinese,inwhichonecansegmentasen tenceinto sequencesoflongorshortwords.Alongertermusu allyimplies shorterconstituentterms.Forexample,thesequenc e abcd canbe segmented into words ab and cd , but each of the Chinese characters a, b, c and d canalsobeaword.Allthesewordsare implied in the occurrence abcd. Then, how can we assign probabilitiestotheseindexes,giventhefactthat theyoverlapinit? Thepreviousapproacheshavesuggestedthefollowin gassignment schemas: ! Two independent assignments: the sequence is indexe d ! Mixedassignment:onecanexpandtheoccurrenceby allthe Both probability assignments are deficient. The ind exes are indeeddependent,andtheassignmentsignorethede pendencies. Thereasonthattheaboveassignmentschemasareus edisdueto the difficulty to take into account the dependences during the indexingphase,partlyforefficiencyreasons,but moreoftendue tothelackofappropriatemodels.
 Thequestionweputforwardinthispaperis:whys houldweforce ourselvestoassignapartofprobabilitytothein dividualterms involvedinanoccurrencewhenwelackinformation fordoingit? Forexample,whenweobservethestring abcd inadocument,we areunabletoassignapreciseprobabilitytoeach oftheterms impliedbecauseoftheirdependenciesandtheoverl appingnature oftheiroccurrencesandprobabilities.
 Theideaweproposeinthispaperistoassignthe probabilityjust atthelevelwecan,i.e.when ab isobserved,wewellassignthe probability to the set of the implied terms { ab, a, b }, and no furtherassumptionismadetoforcetheassignment toeachofthe memberterms.ThisistheideausedinDempster!Sha fertheoryof evidence[4][14].
 Dempster!Shafertheoryhasbeenusedinseveralpre viousstudies inIR[12][16][19].TheophylactouandLalmas[16]c onsidereda compound term as a set of single terms following De mpster! Shafertheory.However,theprobabilityassignedto asetofterms wasdeterminedfromtheIDFvaluesofeachofthet ermsintheset, thereby losing all the inherent dependency between single and compoundterms.Dempster!Shafertheoryhasalsobee nusedin [12]tocombinecontentandlinkevidenceinwebIR ,andin[19] tocombinetextualandvisualevidenceforimagere trieval.These studiesareconcernedwiththecombinationofmulti plepiecesof evidence,whichisnotourfocusinthispaper.In thispaper,we dealwiththeassignmentofprobabilitymasstoter msortermsets usingDempster!Shafertheory.
 Inthenextsection,wewillfirstdescribebriefly theDempster! Shafertheory.Thenwewilldescribehowitisused inourmodel. Dempster!Shafertheory[4][14]isdevelopedinorde rtoaccount forthelackofinformation,ortheuncertainty.Di fferentfromthe traditionalprobabilitytheory,whenthereislack ofinformationto allowapreciseassignmentofprobabilitytoindivi dualelements, Dempster!Shafer theory will just assign probability to sets of elements. The terms in a set will share the probabi lity mass, however,inanundeterminedway.
 More specifically, let  X  be a set of basic elements under consideration.Thepowerset,  X  2 ,denotesthesetofallpossible subsets of  X  including the empty set  X  . A function whichassignsaprobabilitymasstoeachofthesub sets,andthis functionsatisfiesthefollowingaxioms: 1. Theemptysetisassignedthevalue0: m ( X )=0 2. Thesumoftheprobabilitiesassignedtoallsubset sof X is1: Theprobabilitymass m ( A )assignedtoasubset A expressesthe proportionofallavailableevidencethatsupports theclaimthat theactualstatebelongsto A buttonoparticularsubsetof A . Fromthemassassignments,wecandeterminetwomea sures! plausibility( Pl )andbelief( Bel ),whichareusuallyconsideredas theupperandlowerboundsofaprobabilityinterva l: The belief Bel ( A ) for a set A is defined as the sum ofallthe massesofsubsetsof A : Thatis, Bel ( A )gathersalltheevidencedirectlyinsupportof A or ofitssubsets.Theplausibility Pl ( A )isthesumofallthemassesof thesets B thatintersect A : Thatis, Pl ( A )gathersallevidencethat may support A ,ornotin contradictionwith A .
 When m assigns a part of the evidence to a set A containing severalelements,thisisbecausewedonothaveth enecessary informationabouttheprecisedistributionofthep robabilitymass toeachofthemembers X  X hisisthesourceofunce rtainty.Inthe particular case where m assigns non!zero probabilities only to individual elements (or subsets containing only one element), Dempster!Shafer theory will correspond to the tradi tional probabilitytheory,i.e. Bel ( A )= P ( A )= Pl ( A )forany A containing asingleelement. Inmostpreviousstudies,e.g.usingprobabilistic models,terms areassumedtobeindependent;thus,theoccurrence ofoneterm does not affect that of another. Therefore, the pro babilities of termscanbeestimatedsimplyaccordingtotheirfr equenciesof occurrences.However,thisindependenceassumption ismorefor calculationconveniencethanthereality,asourpr eviousexamples showed. Indeed, we do not know exactly how to assig n an occurrencetothecompoundtermandtoitsconstitu entshorter terms. This situation can be correctly accounted fo r using Dempster!Shafertheory.
 LetusconsiderthecaseofChinese.InChinese,a compoundterm abc canoftenbefurthersegmentedintoshorterwords (suppose thatwecanrecognize ab and bc 1 )andlegitimatesingle!character terms a , b and c .Therefore,when abc isobservedinadocument, we should not segment it only as a compound term. T his occurrencealsoimpliesalltheotherimpliedterms .However,as weareunabletodistributethisoccurrenceprecise lyamongthem, anappropriaterepresentationistoconsiderthatt heoccurrenceof abc indeedrepresentsthesetofterms{ abc, ab, bc, a, b, c }asin Dempster!Shafer theory. Graphically, this is illust rated in the followingfigure,wherethelargecirclerepresents theoccurrence of abc andthesmallercirclesthoseoftheconstituentt erms:
Inthisstudy,weassumethat ac isnotaconstituentterminthis case,andwewillonlyconsidertermsformedbycon secutive characterstrings.
 Wecanseethatthetermsandtheiroccurrencesstr onglyoverlap, but in this case, wedonotfurtherimposeawayto sharethe occurrence(orprobability)amongthem.
 Now, for a document that contains much longer seque nces of characters,wehavetwochoices: Wecangeneralizetheconsiderationofdependencyb etweenany sequenceanditssubsequences.Forexample,suppose adocument containing the sequence abcd , in which we can recognize two legitimatecompoundwords ab and cd .Onecouldconsiderthe relationshipswithin ab andwithin cd, butalsoconsider ab and cd to be dependent. Thisconsiderationofdependencyc anfurther spread to longer sequences. This generalized consid eration of dependencypossiblyreflectsthereality,as ab and cd couldbe somehowdependent.However,wearethenfacedwith aserious problemofcomplexity,whichmakestheapproachint ractable. Instead, we will take another option, in which we a ssume independence between compound terms ab and cd , which are determined using an existing segmentation process T his assumption is made because in general, there are we aker relationshipsbetweensegmentedwordsthanwithint hesewords (in Chinese). Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the strong dependencies within segmented words only. The gener alized considerationwillbethesubjectofafuturework.
 Thesecondoptionrequiresawordsegmentationtool tochunka textintonon!overlappingsegments.Thereareanum berofsuch tools, and it has been shown that they can usually achieve an accuracyofover95%.Infact,therealproblemof ChineseIRis notinwordsegmentationaccuracy,butratherthec onsiderationof strongly overlapping terms, which is exactly the fo cus of this paper.
 Onceadocumentissegmentedinto non-overlapping segments, wecanusetheirfrequencytoestimatetheirprobab ilityasusual. However,theprobabilityisassignedtothetermse tcorresponding to the segment. Let us denote a segment by t , and the correspondingtermsetby t * .Thenwecanarriveatthefollowing massassignment: where count ( t , D )isthefrequencyofoccurrencesofthesegment t inadocument D and| D |isthesizeofthedocument(thenumber ofsegments).
 Noticethattheaboveassignmentsatisfiesthecond itionsrequired forBPAofDempster!Shafertheory. Givenaquery Q ,itcanalsobesegmentedintoasequenceof segments q 1 q 2 , ..., q n . For example, the query  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  (preventionandtreatmentofAIDS)canbesegmented into  X  X  X   X  (AIDS) and  X  X  X  (prevention and treatment). The correspondingtermsetsare{  X  X  X  X  ,  X  X  X  ,  X  ,  X  ,  X  }and{  X   X  ,  X  ,  X  }. For a query, we assume a logical AND relation betweendifferenttermsets.Tosimplifythenotati on,wewillalso representthetermsetsofthequery Q by * 1 q ,..., * n q ,andtheterm setsofterms d 1 , d 2 ,...inadocument D by ,... , * 2 * 1 correspondence between a document and this query ca n be determined by the following conditional probability using languagemodeling: Ideally,wewouldliketobeabletodefineapreci seprobability function ) | ( * * set * j d appearing in the document and the term set * i q query. With such a function, the probability P ( Q|D ) could be estimatedasfollows: However, the probability ) | ( * * j i d q P cannot be estimated preciselyduetothelackofinformation,asinDem pster!Shafer theory. Following this latter, we can nevertheless define the followinglowerandupperboundsforit: which gather all the direct support evidence and th e possible supportevidence,respectively,for * i q .
 Equivalently, we can also consider that there is a transfer of probabilitymassfromonetermsettoanotherinth esefunctions. Tocorrespondtotheabovefunctions,wecanassume thetransfer function 1 ) | ( = B A t betweentwotermsets A and B respectively asfollows: ! Bel : 1 ) | ( = B A t iff A B  X  ; ! Pl : 1 ) | ( = B A t iff  X   X   X  B A .
 The following figure illustrates the transfer in th e two cases, whereeacharrowrepresentsatransfer t =1foreachcase: Consequently, we can also define the following boun ds 2 for P ( Q | D ): Thenthequerylikelihoodcanbeboundedasfollows : As we saw, the above application of Dempster!Shafer theory assumedatransferofthewholeprobabilitymassfr omoneterm settoanother,accordingtowhethertheformeris asubsetof,or intersects with, the latter. No particular knowledg e about the languageisused.Infact,thelanguagecanprovide uswithabetter definition of the transfer function. For example, i t can be generallyadmittedinChinesethatwhentheterm ab isobserved, the shorter terms a and b are also observed. So the latter are implied,andwecanadmitastrongtransferfromth eformersubset ( ab )*tothelatter a *and b *.Ontheotherhand,whenashorter termisobserved,alongertermisalsoimpliedto somedegree. Forexample,theterm  X  X  X  (AIDS)canimply  X  X  X  X  ([diseaseof] AIDS).Therefore,thereisalsosometransferfrom theformerterm settothelatter.However,thistransferstrongly dependsoncases. For example, the transferfromaveryambiguousand frequent character such as  X  (person) to a specific termsuchas  X  X  X  (humanrights)shouldbemuchlowerthanbetween  X  X  X  and  X   X  X  X  (AIDS).Thetransferdegreefromatermsettoan other stronglydependsonhowmuchtheformeroverlapswi ththelatter andhowfrequenttheyareinthecollection(thela nguage).We willprovidesomeintuitivecriteriaforthedefini tionoftransfer functions below.

According ly, we can define the following generalized form of evaluation function insteadof Bel and Pl functions: Now,letusconsiderinmoredetailthedesiredtra nsferfunction for Chinese. Our definition is guidedbythefollow inggeneral observations: 1. AlongerChineseterm ab usuallystronglyimpliesashorter 2. Ashorterterm a ismoreambiguousthanalongerterm ab , 3.

 Allthesefunctionswillbetestedinourexperimen ts.Itturnsoutthat thethirddefinitionresultsinthebesteffectiven ess.

Onemayraisetheconcernaboutthecomplexitytoe stimatethe transferfunction.Although,theoretically,wewill have O ( n n is the number of terms (including single!character words) in Chinese,inpractice,weonlyhavetoestimatethe transferbetween termsetsthatsharesomecommoncharacters.Given thelengthof wordsisusuallynotmorethan4charactersandthe averagelength ofwordsisaround2characters,thepracticaltime fortheestimation can be much reduced. Another complexity is the expo nential numberoftermswithinatermset.However,inour case,several factorscontributetolimitthiscomplexityinprac tice:1)werestrict thetermssetstothosethatcorrespondtoknownCh inesewords (determined by a segmentation tool); 2) the length of the latter usuallydoesnotexceeds4characters;and3)weon lyconsiderterms thatareconsecutivecharactersinthesegment,i.e .for abc ,weonly considertheterms ab and bc ,butnot ac (whichismuchlesslikely tobeasub!termof abc ingeneral).Therefore,theactualcomplexity inourcalculationisstronglyconfined.

 For the method M 3 , the t!test shows that most of the improvementsoverthetraditionalmethodsusingas ingletypeof indexarestatisticallysignificant.Comparedwith thecombined traditionalmethods,theimprovementsarenotalway sstatistically significant.However,wedoobservegeneralimprove mentsonall thecollections,exceptinonecase X  X TCIR4compar edtoW+U.

 Inthenextsection,wewillanalyzesomeexamples toshowwhy ourmethodsperformedbetter. Adetailedanalysisrevealsseveralinterestingfac ts. The new method can consider various expressions of the same concept. SomeconceptshavevariouswritingsinChinese.Thi sisthecase for AIDS ,whichcanbewrittenas  X   X  X  X  or  X  X  X  X  .Oneofthe testqueries(CH73)usedthesecondwriting:  X  X  (China)  X  (of)  X  X  X  X  (AIDS) X  X IDSinChina;whilemanyrelevantdocume nts used the first one. As a consequence, the simple wo rd!based approachresultedinanaverageprecisioncloseto 0.
 Ontheotherhand,theunigram!basedmethodcantak eadvantage ofthecommoncharacters,andtheresultisverygo od:0.3313in average precision. The method combining wordsandu nigrams resultedin0.3983averageprecision.
 Usingourmodel,thequerycanmatchboththewhole exactterm or partially match the alternative writing through the common characters.Weobtained0.4268inaverageprecision .
 Compared to the traditional combination method, our method doesnotconsiderafixedwaytocombinecharacters andterms. Instead, we try to determine the proportion of docu ments containing  X  and  X  thatalsocontain  X  X  X  X  (thequeryterm). Thatis,inthiscase,thetransferfunctionisdef inedas: t ((  X  X  X  X  )*|(  X  X  X  X  )*)= df (  X  X  X  X  )*/ df ((  X  X  X  X  )*  X  (  X  X  X  X  )*) = df (  X  X  X  X  )*/df({  X  ,  X  })) whichisrelativelyhighinthiscase.
 Our method can exploit the implied shorter words. Whenalongtermimpliesashorterterm,ourmodel canconsider bothofthem,aswellastheirrelationship.
 ForthequeryNTCIR5,query18:  X  X  X  X  (tobaccobusiness)  X  X  (accusation)  X  X  X  (compensation), the first word contains a shorterword  X  X  X  (tobacco).Thelongterm  X  X  X  X  isamuchless frequent word than the shorter word  X  X  X  in Chinese. As a consequence, the word!based approach will also miss many relevantdocumentstalkingabout  X  X  X  .Theaverageprecisionof thismethodisonly0.0998.
 Usingthemixtureofwordsandunigrams,wewillal soconsider thesinglecharacterterms  X  (tobacco,smoke),  X  (herb,grass),  X  (business,commerce,discuss).Althoughthesechar actersare quitecommonandambiguous,consideringthemstill raisedthe averageprecisionofthisqueryto0.2895.
 Inourapproach,thereisastrongtransferbetween thetermset correspondingto  X  X  X  tothetermsetcorrespondingto  X  X  X  X  . This will enable the documents about  X  X  X  to have a strong correspondence with the query. For this query, our approach obtainedanaverageprecisionof0.4210.
 Our method can weaken the influence of ambiguous si ngle characters. Whencharacterunigramsareusedinatraditionala pproach,it participatesinthematchingprocessatanequalim portance,i.e. anycharacterisassignedaprobabilityinaunifor mmanner.In fact,somecharactersarehighlyambiguous,aswes howedinthe last example  X  X  X  (tobacco). When a compound term is discomposedintosuchambiguouscharacters,wewill almostlose allthespecificmeaningofthecompound.Anothere xampleis  X   X  (human rights), which is a quite specific term, bu t it is composedoftwocommoncharacters:  X  (person)and  X  (right, power).Ifwerelyonthesecharactersinafixedm anner,many irrelevantdocumentswillberetrieved.
 Ontheotherhand,throughtheestimationofthetr ansferfunction according to document frequency, our method will be able to estimatethatatermsetcontaining  X  willnottransferalarge amountofprobabilitytotheterm  X  X  X  ,soisfrom  X  to  X  X  X  .As a consequence, the role of such ambiguous character s in the matchingprocesswillbediminished.Thisexamplea lsoexplains whythefirsttransferfunction( t 1 ) didnotworkwell. Our method can also introduce noise. Determiningatransferfromcharactersdoesnotalw aysproduce betterresult.Forexample,CH27ofTREC5asksfor  X  X  (China)  X  (in)  X  X  X  X  (robotics)  X  X  X  (area)  X  (of)  X  X  X  (research)! RoboticsresearchinChina.Usingunigram!basedmet hod,thekey term  X  X  X  X  (Robot) is decomposed into 3 very common characters  X  (machine,engine)  X  (machine,utensil),  X  (human, person),anditleadsalowaverageprecision(0.13 19).Forthis query,word!basedmethodobtainsahigheffectivene ss(0.4302). Whenwordsandunigramsarecombined(WU),weobtai n0.3734, lowerthanusingthewordalone.Ourmethodachieve s0.3952in averageprecision.Althoughthiseffectivenessish igherthanthe traditionalWUmethod,itisstilllowerthanWalo ne.

Thisalsoshowsanaspectwhichweshouldimprovei nourfuture research X  X odefineamorereasonabletransferfun ctionthatbetter consider how the term set to which the transfer is made is ambiguous. Document frequency can partly account fo r term ambiguity,butbettercriteriashouldbefound.
 Despitethispotentialrisk,theglobaleffectofo urmethodusing transferfunctionsispositive.Itallowsmatching slightlydifferent terms,whilethetransferrateismeasuredbythee xtentthetwo termscorrespond. Inthispaper,wedealtwiththefundamentalproble mofusing differenttermsandconsideringtherelationshipsb etweenthem. Differentfromthepreviousapproaches,ourapproac hdoesnot make strong independent assumption to force assigni ng probabilitytoindividualterms.Instead,wefollow edtheprinciple ofDempster!Shafertheoryandassignedprobabilitie stosetsof terms, which we cannot separate. This consideration can well account for the phenomenon that terms strongly over lap in documents,andtherefore,thesameoccurrenceofa stringcanbe simultaneously considered as that of a long term an d that of shortertermsincludedinit.Theassignmenttothe setofthese termsallowsustoavoidduplicatingtheoccurrence artificially, resultinginamoreprincipledwaytoestimateprob ability. Dempster!Shafer theory considers two functions: bel ief and plausibility.Itonlyconsidersthecasesthattwo termsetsoverlap or are inclusive. No specific knowledge about the l anguage is used. In our approach, we have extended these funct ions by consideringthepossiblerelationshipsbetweenterm sorbetween termsets.Thisresultedinamoresuitablematchin gfunctionfor IR,especiallyinChinese.
 Inthispaper,wehavefocusedonthegeneralmodel andmany aspectsremaintobefullyexplored.Forexample,w ehavedefined simpletransferfunctions,andindeed,morecomplex functionscan be defined by considering better criteria, especial ly for the consideration of term ambiguity, as we discussed ea rlier. In addition, the transfer function can rely on richer linguistic knowledge rather than just character overlapping or term distributions.Forexample,onecantakeadvantage oflinguistic resourcessuchasathesaurus X  X ftwotermsetsco rrespondtotwo relatedtermsinthethesaurus,thenastrongertra nsferfunction can be defined. Term co!occurrences can be used as another resource. When we extend the approach in this direc tion, the transferfunctioncanbeusedasageneralmeansto considerany type of relationship between terms. This will be an interesting futurework.
 Onemayalsohavenoticedthatwedidnotexplicitl yrepresentthe dependencies between terms within a term set. Howev er, the dependencies are considered through the utilization of transfer functions.So,termdependenciesareindirectlycon sidered. The proposed approach can be applied beyond the lim it of segmentedwords,i.e.wecanalsoconsiderdependen ciesbetween segmentedwordsinChinese.Thekeyquestionishow toconsider relatively strong relations between segmented words , while avoidingconsideringtermsthatarenottrulyrelat edinasentence. Thisisaninterestingaspecttobestudiedinthe future.
