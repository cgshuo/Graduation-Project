In the past, there have been two main sets of ideas about categorising measures: researchers.

When a user's query extracts information from a multidimensional database ( summary form. The user's query specifies: (a) The aggregation operation (e.g. a summation, a mean or a count), (b) The measure which is to be aggregated, and (c) Either an aggregation level or a member for each dimension.

The query can only produce meaningful results if: 1. The aggregation operation is appropriate for the measure and 2. The measure is appropriate for the aggregation levels in the cube's dimensions.
When both of the above conditions are true, we say that the selected data is over a number of points in time.

In particular, for the second of the above pair of conditions, what is our model is that we can provide provably-correct conditions for determining additivity. future work are given in Section 10 . 2.

Kimball and Ross [12] categorise measures as follows:  X

We find it useful to identify the following two special cases of the  X

Snapshot measure data (e.g. the temperature represents movements of molecules or the speed distances and times). non-pre-aggregated and pre-aggregated cube. We define the snapshot measure as follows:

In some cases the required modifications can be done in the ETL (Extraction processbutsometimesthisisnotpossible  X  or it is more practical to operate with the original values. 7. Additivity aggregation functions is discussed in Section 8 . Horner et al. [8] define additivity as follows: when the sum operation cannot be applied.

Based on literature (e.g. [22]), we can identify five possible main problems in additivity: 1. The measure does not depend on all dimensions. Example: in the sport company realm, having a measure like times. hierarchies. Example: a product belongs to two different product groups. values over the time dimension. measure units, and the final one to statistical scales of measures.
 7.1. Requirements for additivity this section, depends on the dimension and the measure.

We define an aggregation operation in an OLAP cube to be correct if: 2. The measure unit of each value of the measure attribute participating in the aggregation is the same. 3. The statistical scale of the measure attribute is the ratio scale. zip codes.

We can assume that for any pre-aggregated cube, c , there exists a non-pre-aggregated cube, say c to a unique set of tuples in c  X  and we obtain the pre-aggregated cube c from c needed when calculating the measure values in aggregation, as defined in Definition 3 .
De fi
L et c  X  be a cube, obtained by aggregation  X  D ( c ). Then assume the function f ( c that are used to calculate t [ m ]  X  c  X  .

We say that the measure m is additive in c for dimension D if 1. c is either a non pre-aggregated cube or a cube produced from a cube c 2. for each tuple t  X  c  X  , t [ m ]=  X  ( f ( c  X  , D , t , m )), 3. the measure units of the measure value returned by f ( c 4. the scale of each measure value returned by f ( c  X  , D , t , m ) is the ratio scale . an ordering closure of c i nstead of c .

Theorem 13 (Measure types and additivity). Based on the de measure types have the following properties: Both semi-tally and reckoning are additive over a domain-complete non-ordering dimension.
Proof. Let c be an OLAP cube over a schema C , D 1  X  C an ordering dimension, D dimensions. 2. Next, assume that m is a semi-tally measure. First of all, if D m is additive over D 2 .As m is a semi-tally measure, D 2 if m is additive over a non-ordering dimension. counted several times. Based on Definition 10 the reckoning measure is constructed by a maximum value of t  X  [ D 1 ]. Thus, the tuple t is joined at least to itself and t an aggregation thereby violating additivity. The situation with D the temporal dimension of theirs is only a sub-class of our ordering dimension. 7.2. Additive OLAP cube To conclude the requirements of additivity, we give the following corollary:
Corollary 14 (Additive OLAP cube). Let c be a valid OLAP cube over a schema D dimension attributes, M is the set of measure attributes, M dimension and measure combination if: 1. There are no snapshot type measures in c . 3. If there are any semi-tally measures, then the only dimension in c is the ordering dimension. 4. For each measure , m , in c , all of the values for m share an identical measure unit. 5. The scales of all measures are ratio scales.

Proof. The proof follows from Definition 12 and Theorem 13 . 8. Detecting summarizability aggregation functions. 8.1. Detecting measure types applied ETL processes.
 We can give the following classification to help the designer to determine the correct measure types:
Tally measure:  X 
Non-pre-aggregated cube:  X  independent events measured in a particular point in time (e.g. the value of the sold item).  X 
Pre-aggregated cube:  X  a value measured in a period of time (e.g. daily sales), or  X  a change in a fixed period (e.g. daily changes in inventory).  X  In our running example sold items and sales belong to this group.

Semi-tally measure:  X 
Similar to the tally measure but clearly not additive over some non-ordering dimensions such as geography.  X  In our running example daily precipitation belongs to this group.

Reckoning measure:  X 
Non-pre-aggregated cube:  X  an observed value of the same phenomenon at a particular point in time (e.g. daily inventory values),  X 
Pre-aggregated cube:  X  a cumulative sum of changes (e.g. inventory level).  X  In our running example inventory belongs to this group.

Snapshot measure:  X  indirect measurements [8] (e.g. temperature, and speed).  X  In our running example temperature belongs to this group.

Conversion factor measure:  X  a conversion factor is the quotient of two measures (e.g. 1.28 USD/EUR)  X 
In our running example currency exchange rates belongs to this group. 8.1.1. Tally versus semi-tally measures support our argument that this form of precipitation measurement is an example of a semi-tally. order to compare the total leakage from day to day, we must add the two heights. for each zone are added together to find an estimate for the total precipitation in the catchment area. nothing other than itself. Hence the height is not a tally, whereas the volume is a tally. 8.1.2. Snapshot versus reckoning measures
The following example is intended to illustrate the differences between reckoning and snapshot measures. averaged over 24 h. As a measure it is a snapshot measure.
