Parallel, Distributed, Heterogeneity, etc. These terms were really popular in 90s X  computer science research projects, and papers. Nowadays that technologies, developed during those years, are actually used and improved. Papers explicitly on that technologies do not appear as frequently as before, but those topic are still present.

Data is available everywhere. The web, for instance, is estimated to contain more than 500 billion of doc-uments, most of them are hidden behind enterprise websites or are automatically generated in response to databases queries ( Mardis, 2002 ). If we also keep into account the enormous amount of different types of data available (images, video, music, sounds, etc.), the figures become impressive.

Ranging from simple Network of Workstation to the more modern and complex grid systems, the adoption of distributed systems instead of massively parallel supercomputers has been preferred due to their reduced cost of ownership. These kinds of systems pose many challenges in terms of information access, storage and retrieval. Usually, in fact, instead of having collections stored at a single site they are collected, and some-times managed, at different sites (possible owned by different institutions). Particular interest, usually is ex-pressed on architectures and specifications for information retrieval in the context of heterogeneous distributed computing systems. Recently a paper by Baeza-Yates, Castillo, Junqueira, Plachouras, and Silves-tri (in press) discuss several challenges on distributed IR systems. They highlight several different issues with current distributed Web IR systems components, i.e. the Crawler, Indexer, and Query Broker. Also, they de-vise that to cope with the enormous amount of data available, modern web search engines must use parallel and distributed computing techniques.

Moreover, starting from 2004 workshops on Information Retrieval in Peer-to-Peer Networks and Hetero-geneous systems have been held together with two major conferences in IR: SIGIR, and CIKM. Some of the papers in this special issue are coming from the workshop on Heterogeneous and Distributed Information
Retrieval that have been held in conjunction with SIGIR 2005 ( Baraglia, Laforenza, &amp; Silvestri, 2005 ), others are papers submitted especially for this issue.

The papers in this special issue are divided into three different categories:  X  Heterogeneous Data Management.  X  Distributed IR.  X  Peer-to-Peer IR.

Papers in the Heterogeneous Data Management section are about different techniques for integrating data coming from heterogeneous data repositories. The authors of  X  X  X nformation Retrieval and Machine Learning for Probabilistic Schema Matching X  X  present a novel framework based on IR and Machine Learning tech-niques, called sPLMap, for automatically learning schema mapping rules. The real innovative point of this paper is that candidates for mapping are chosen and weighted according to a probability-based scoring function capable of dealing with the intrinsic uncertainty of the mapping process. The second paper entitled  X  X  X haring Mass Spectrometry Data in a Grid-based Distributed Proteomics Laboratory X  X  is about something really different from classic textual IR. The aim of this paper is showing how it is possible to integrate data coming from different proteomics laboratories using Grid-computing-based facilities. What it is really inter-esting with this paper, is the different point of view it offers of IR in heterogeneous system. In there, informa-tion is not as complex as text, but is represented by data coming from different and heterogeneous sources (i.e. laboratories). The proposed framework is also capable of validating data and composition schemes by means of an ontology that drive the entire experiment building phase.

The papers in the distributed IR section are about two different issues in the design of a parallel/distributed information retrieval systems. The first paper entitled  X  X  X nalyzing Imbalance among Homogeneous Index Servers in a Web Search System X  X  is a paper dealing with the measurement of various performance indicators of a distributed web search engine. The main important finding in their paper is about the fact that differently from what has been observed previously, load is not evenly balanced because of disk caching effect due to cor-relation between query terms and index terms. Different architecture, a highly distributed grid system, is used to build a web search engine and it is presented in the paper entitled  X  X  X rchitecture of a Grid-Enabled Web Search Engine X  X . Apart from several nice features that this architecture offers, one of the most important assets of the system proposed is its socio-cultural value. Grid, by its very nature is a domain of cultural integration, and this paper shows how to establish socio-cultural interaction and integration by means of Grid infrastructure.

The papers in the Peer-to-Peer IR section are about three different techniques for managing, storing and retrieving data in P2P overlay networks. The first paper is entitle  X  X  X earch and browse services for heteroge-neous collections with the peer-to-peer network Pepper X  X  describes a P2P network of distributes services that allows users to browse a distributed collection of documents. The network is heterogeneous in the sense that services provide different functionality to the users. For example a service may store and provide statistics about the collection, another may provide indexing, another may transform documents into different schema for allowing integration. The middleware used for communication is JXTA-SOAP, but the modularity of the system proposed allow for using it with different protocols and middlewares. The paper  X  X  X 2P Dating: Real Life Inspired Semantic Overlay Networks for Web Search X  X  is about a new algorithm for creating P2P overlay networks based on the notion of  X  X  X 2P dating X  X . Basically, what they are doing is rearranging peers X  connec-tions according to the criteria of being a  X  X  X ood X  X  neighbor. Several factors can be taken into account to decide when a neighbor is a  X  X  X ood X  X  one. For instance, the level of overlap between their documents, level of trusts, etc. The last paper is entitled  X  X  X earest Neighbor Search in Metric Spaces through Content-Addressable Net-works X  X  and is about searching multimedia information on a P2P network. Differently from the other papers of this issue, authors focus on extending the well-know Content Addressable Network (CAN) paradigm to sup-port the search of multimedia information embedded in metric spaces. Basically, the are able to propagate nearest neighbor queries efficiently within this kind of P2P networks.

I thank Prof. Ricardo Baeza-Yates for supporting and helping me in the preparation of this special issue, and Prof. Tefko Saracevic for having trusted me and having given me the possibility of carrying out this work. I also thank all of the authors that submitted very high quality papers to this issue. Without them all this issue would have never been possible.

Before concluding, I express my deep sadness for a friend, and colleague of ours, that suddenly died under very tragic circumstances: Henrik Nottelmann. I remember his continuous and enthusiastic effort in making this community successful and growing. I can remember many discussions with him, especially the last time we met. We were in Salvador, and we just finished the discussion session of the HDIR workshop. I can remember him keep the discussion going with the other participants, even after the workshop was close. We will miss you Henrik, wherever you are I hope you would feel how proud we are of having been able to collaborate with you. This special issue is dedicated to you.
