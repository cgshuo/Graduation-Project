 Collections of scholarly documents are usually not thought of as big data. However, large collections of scholarly documents often have many millions of publications, authors, citations, equations, figures, etc., and large scale related data and structures such as social networks, slides, data sets, etc. We discuss scholarly big data challenges, insights, methodologies and a pplications. We illustrate scholarly big data issues w ith examples of specialized search engines and recommendation systems that use information extraction and data mining in various areas such as computer science, chemistry, archaeology, acknowledgements, reference recommendation, collaboration recommendation, and others. Dr. C. Lee Giles is the David Reese Professor of Information Sciences and Technology at the Pennsylvania State University with appointments in the departments of Computer Science and Engineering, and Supply Chain and Information Systems. His research interests are in intelligent cyberinfrastructure and big data, web tools, specialty search engines, information retrieval, digital libraries, web services, knowledge and information extraction, data mining, entity disambiguation, and social networks. He has published over 300 papers in these areas. He was a cocreator of the popular search engine CiteSeer (now CiteSeerX) and related scholarly search engines. He is a fellow of the ACM, IEEE, and INNS.
