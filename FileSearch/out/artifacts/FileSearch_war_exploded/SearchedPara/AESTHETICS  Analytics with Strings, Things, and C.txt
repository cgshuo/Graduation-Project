 This paper describes an advanced news analytics and explo-ration system that allows users to visualize trends of entities like politicians, countries, and organizations in continuously updated news articles. Our system improves state-of-the-art text analytics by linking ambiguous names in news arti-cles to entities in knowledge bases like Freebase, DBpedia or YAGO. This step enables indexing entities and interpreting the contents in terms of entities. This way, the analysis of trends and co-occurrences of entities gains accuracy, and by leveraging the taxonomic type hierarchy of knowledge bases, also in expressiveness and usability. In particular, we can an-alyze not only individual entities, but also categories of en-tities and their combinations, including co-occurrences with informative text phrases. Our Web-based system demon-strates the power of this approach by insightful anecdotic analysis of recent events in the news.
Proper analysis and understanding of large amounts of texts has become a major necessity, as the amount of natural-language contents keeps growing, especially in the context of social media and daily news, but also regarding scholarly publications and digitized books. A notable project in this line is the Culturomics [9] project, which supports an aggre-gated view of trends in the recent human history captured by the Google books corpus. Here, interesting conclusions are drawn about linguistic changes or cultural phenomena using string-level keywords, by comparing frequencies over time periods and across languages.

The system presented in this paper, called Aesthetics (short for Analysis and Exploration with Strings, Things, and Categories), goes beyond mere string-based analysis, by supporting the analysis and exploration of entities ( X  X hings X ) and categories ( X  X ats X ). This semantic level is provided by linking text phrases to knowledge bases like Google X  X  Knowl-edge Graph ( freebase.com ) or yago-knowledge.org . Knowl-edge bases contain a large number of persons, places, or-ganizations, etc. providing a repository of unique entities in canonicalized form, with assignment to fine-grained se-mantic classes (categories). The Aesthetics system auto-matically discovers and disambiguates these entities in news texts, linking the unstructured to the structured world. In-stead of specifying words or phrases as the target of mining trends and patterns, we can now see and analyze entities di-rectly. Aesthetics supports the analysis of textual surface phrases ( X  X trings X ) as well, but its full power comes from combining these with proper entities and categories.
To illustrate why this is a major step with strong ben-efits, consider the task of visualizing trends around the re-cent Ukrainian crisis, which originated from the Maidan, the square in Kiev where thousands of Ukrainians protested in early 2014. A search for  X  X aidan X  quickly reveals that the name is highly ambiguous, as it means  X  X quare X  not only in Ukrainian, but also in Hindi and Arabic. Thus, simply counting the string  X  X aidan X  will result in a large number of false positives, leading to an imprecise analysis, as shown in Figure 1. By specifying the canonicalized entity Maidan Nezalezhnosti , not only do we get rid of spurious mentions of other Maidans, but also find articles where the square is mentioned only by its English name  X  X ndependence Square X . Thus, entity-level analytics, as supported by Aesthetics is the only way to get accurate numbers.

Additionally, as we now have the full potential of a struc-tured knowledge base in the background, further opportuni-ties are opened up. In all semantic knowledge bases, entities are organized in a category hierarchy, e. g. Greenpeace is an environmental organization , which in turn is a subclass of a general organization . Using this category hierarchy, we can conduct analyses for entire groups of entities, for example, comparing the presence of environmental orga-nizations and power companies in news of different parts of the world, deriving a picture of how their importance changes over time. The hierarchical organization of cate-gories adds another dimension for aggregation to the usual temporal and spatial dimensions (where news can be aggre-gated by publishing times and originating regions).
There is ample work on text analytics for identifying (and visualizing) trends and patterns. Although this is of impor-tance also for enterprise documents, most of the published research addresses social media (see, e.g., [8] and references there). The goals here are manifold: discovering events [3], connecting topics and users [1], and more.

Applications of such methods include culturomics [9] over the Google books corpus and computational journalism [5]. Although some of this work refers to  X  X ntities X , the granular-ity of analyses really is noun phrases, disregarding the am-biguity of entity names. Also, there is no awareness of back-ground knowledge bases. Two notable exceptions are the re-cent works by [10] and [7]. The former is a proof-of-concept project for annotating Web archive contents with entities. The latter applies shallow methods for entity markup to the French newspaper Le Monde, to support entity-aware culturomics. Our system uses much deeper methods for en-tity disambiguation and supports much richer analytics over both entities and categories. Other related work addresses the retrieval of entities in web or enterprise search (e.g., [2, 4]), as opposed to retrieving documents.
The Aesthetics engine for news analytics allows users to quickly spot trends of entities or groups of entities specified by a semantic category. The trend visualization is computed on daily occurrences of entities in articles of nearly 300 news sources. Continuously gathering news since June 2013, the Aesthetics corpus now comprises more than 1.1 million articles. In each article, all entities are discovered and dis-ambiguated using AIDA [6], which links all mentions in the article to entities in YAGO. YAGO contains ca. 500,000 se-mantic categories, comprising 4 million individual entities for which users can query. The entity index of Aesthetics contains ca. 300,000 distinct YAGO entities which have been spotted in the news, and ca. 22 million entity occurrences.
One challenge is to support the user when specifying the entities and categories of interest for the actual analysis. The scale of YAGO renders the naive approach of letting a user choose from a list of everything infeasible. We solve this problem by providing automatic suggestions for entities and categories while the user is typing in the search field. When selected, a suggestion becomes a tag in the query field. The suggestion for entities and categories use a similar approach, first finding potential matching candidates based on a prefix matching, then ranking the candidates appropriately:
Entity Suggestions. All canonical entity names are stored in a trie for fast prefix lookup. Additionally, all token-wise suffixes are stored. For this, the name is split at whites-paces into tokens, and the complete string starting at each token is added as an additional label for the entity in the trie. This allows users to start typing a name in the middle; for example when typing  X  X bama X , Aesthetics still returns Barack Obama as a candidate. All matching candidates are then ranked based on the overall popularity in Wikipedia, which is estimated by the number of incoming links. Thus, typing  X  X bama X  results in the suggestion Barack Obama , and Michelle Obama , in that order.

Category Suggestions. As with entities, all category names are stored in a trie. In contrast to entity names, category names can have an arbitrary order of words. For example, both United States presidents and Presidents of the United States are perfectly valid categories, and it is up to the Wikipedia edtiors X  judgment which one to use. To cope with this diversity issue, we add all 3-token permu-tations as additional lookup keys, making sure that the real category shows for any permutation of {  X  X nited X ,  X  X tates X ,  X  X resident X  } . The ranking is done based on the popularity of the contained entities, preferring categories with high av-erage popularity. However, when typing  X  X ompan X , the ex-pected result should not be American IT companies , even though their average popularity might be very high; instead our method prioritizes more generic IT companies or just companies . Thus, the popularity-based ranking is balanced with a preference for categories that are closer to the root of the class hierarchy the categories are organized in.
A screenshot of the Aesthetics Web interface is shown in Figure 2. In the search box at the top, entities, categories, and strings can be specified using the auto-completion method described above. On execution of the query, our system dis-plays a chart showing the trend lines based on the daily occurrences of each item in the central area.
Our Aesthetics system provides rich functionality for ad-hoc search and analytics over more than 1.1 million news articles. Conference participants will be able to flexibly ex-plore the system X  X  capabilities. The following are some of the conceivable use-cases.

Accurate entity counts. Entity-based analysis improves the accuracy over string-based analysis. The precision is im-proved as ambiguous names are resolved to the correct en-tity, removing unwanted occurrences. Better recall is achieved by also finding occurrences of the same entity under different names. Figure 1 shows a graph contrasting the various ways of specifying the target of the frequency analysis, using the example of the Maidan square in Kiev. Searching merely for  X  X aidan X  overestimates the actual numbers by a factor of up to 2 (in February), while sometimes underestimating the true count (in late January). Searching for its English name  X  X ndependence Square X  is not useful, either, as there are squares with this name all around the world.

Entity co-occurrence analysis. Comparing individual entity occurrences is already a powerful way of analyzing news and spotting trends or interesting topic shifts. A com-mon scenario is that there is one main entity of interest, e. g. the Ukraine , and an analyst is interested in viewing and interpreting news in terms of other entities co-occurring with the main entity. Consider again the events around the Ukrainian crisis, analyzing the involvement of Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin over time, as depicted in Fig-ure 3. Aesthetics provides the advanced functionality of viewing occurrences for the three entities Crimea, Obama , and Putin given that Ukraine has to be mentioned in the text. Without this constraint, analyzing the impact of the event on mentions of Obama is hard, as he is mentioned in a large number of totally unrelated contexts. Using the co-occurrence restriction, it becomes easy to spot that he be-came only involved once the Crimea situation escalated, and not in the initial protests in Ukraine .

Analyzing semantic groups of entities. Analyzing occurrences of all entities in a semantic group (e.g., Ukrainian politicians, female political activists, etc.) is impossible with just strings. With unstructured text linked to enti-ties in a category hierarchy, it becomes a natural thing to do. The screenshot in in Figure 2 shows an example of an insightful analysis of this kind. The figure shows how often power companies or environmental organizations have been mentioned in news. This analysis reveals that the rise of the Crimea tensions in February had a remarkable effect on the frequency of mentions of power companies  X  driven by Europe X  X  dependence on Russian gas, which is of-ten transported through Ukraine. On the other hand, men-tions of environmental organizations, opposing environmen-tally hazardous ways of getting gas by fracking, have gone down. This anecdotic evidence is strengthened by the obser-vation that the effect is especially pronounced in European news, and harder to spot when removing the region filter.
