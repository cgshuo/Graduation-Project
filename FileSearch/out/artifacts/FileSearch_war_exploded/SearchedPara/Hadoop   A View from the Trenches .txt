 From it X  X  beginnings as a framework for building web crawlers for small -scale search engines to being one of the most p romising technologies for building datacenter -scale distributed computing and storage platforms, Apache Hadoop has come far in the last seven years. In this talk I will reminisce about the early days of Hadoop, and will give an overview of the current stat e of the Hadoop ecosystem, and some real -world use cases of this open source platform. I will conclude with some crystal gazing in the future of Hadoop and associated technologies.

Performance, Reliability Hadoop; Open Source Milind Bhandarkar was the founding member of the team at Yahoo! that took Apache Hadoop from 20 -node prototype to datacenter -scale production system, and has been contributing and working with Hadoop since versio n 0.1.0. He started the Yahoo! Grid solutions team focused on training, consulting, and supporting hundreds of new migrants to Hadoop. Parallel programming languages and paradigms has been his area of focus for over 20 years, and his area of specialization for PhD (Computer Science) from University of Illinois at Urbana -Champaign. Previously, he has worked at the Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C -DAC), National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), Center for Simulation of Advanced Ro ckets, Siebel Systems, Pathscale Inc. (acquired by QLogic), Yahoo! and Linkedin. Currently, he is the Chief Scientist, Machin e Learning Platforms at Pivotal .
