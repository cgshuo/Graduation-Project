 This tutorial aims to provide attendees with a clear notion of how discourse structure is relevant for language technology (LT), what is needed for ex-ploiting discourse structure, what methods and re-sources are available to support its use, and what more could be done in the future. This tutorial consists of four parts. Part I starts with a brief introduction to different bases for dis-course structuring, properties of discourse struc-ture that are relevant to LT, and accessible evi-dence for discourse structure.

For discourse structure to be useful for lan-guage technologies, one must be able to automati-cally recognize or generate with it. Hence, Part II surveys computational approaches to recognizing and generating discourse structure, both manually-authored approaches and ones developed through Machine Learning.

Part III of the tutorial describes applications of discourse structure recognition and generation in LT, as well as discourse-related resources be-ing made available in English, German, Turkish, Hindi, Czech, Arabic and Chinese. Part IV con-cludes with a list of future possibilities. 1. PART I  X  General Overview 2. PART II  X  Computational Recognition and 3. PART III  X  Applications and Resources 4. PART IV  X  Future Developments
