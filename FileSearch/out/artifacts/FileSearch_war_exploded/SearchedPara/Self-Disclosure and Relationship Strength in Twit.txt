 We often self-disclose , that is, share our emotions, personal information, and secrets, with our friends, family, coworkers, and even strangers. Social psy-chologists say that the degree of self-disclosure in a relationship depends on the strength of the relation-ship, and strategic self-disclosure can strengthen the relationship (Duck, 2007). In this paper, we study whether relationship strength has the same effect on self-disclosure of Twitter users.

To do this, we first present a method for compu-tational analysis of self-disclosure in online conver-sations and show promising results. To accommo-date the largely unannotated nature of online conver-sation data, we take a topic-model based approach (Blei et al., 2003) for discovering latent patterns that reveal self-disclosure. A similar approach was able to discover sentiments (Jo and Oh, 2011) and emo-tions (Kim et al., 2012) from user contents. Prior work on self-disclosure for online social networks has been from communications research (Jiang et al., 2011; Humphreys et al., 2010) which relies on human judgements for analyzing self-disclosure. The limitation of such research is that the data is small, so our approach of automatic analysis of self-disclosure will be able to show robust results over a much larger data set.

Analyzing relationship strength in online social networks has been done for Facebook and Twitter in (Gilbert and Karahalios, 2009; Gilbert, 2012) and for enterprise SNS (Wu et al., 2010). In this paper, we estimate relationship strength simply based on the duration and frequency of interaction. We then look at the correlation between self-disclosure and relationship strength and present the preliminary re-sults that show a positive and significant correlation. Twitter is widely used for conversations (Ritter et al., 2010), and prior work has looked at Twitter for dif-ferent aspects of conversations (Boyd et al., 2010; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2011; Ritter et al., 2011). Ours is the first paper to analyze the degree of self-disclosure in conversational tweets. In this section, we describe the details of our Twitter con-versation data and our methodology for analyzing relationship strength and self-disclosure. 2.1 Twitter Conversation Data A Twitter conversation is a chain of tweets where two users are consecutively replying to each other X  X  tweets using the Twitter reply button. We identified dyads of English-tweeting users who had at least three conversations from October, 2011 to Decem-ber, 2011 and collected their tweets for that dura-tion. To protect users X  privacy, we anonymized the data to remove all identifying information. This dataset consists of 131,633 users, 2,283,821 chains and 11,196,397 tweets. 2.2 Relationship Strength Research in social psychology shows that relation-ship strength is characterized by interaction fre-quency and closeness of a relationship between two people (Granovetter, 1973; Levin and Cross, 2004). Hence, we suggest measuring the relation-ship strength of the conversational dyads via the fol-lowing two metrics. Chain frequency (CF) mea-sures the number of conversational chains between the dyad averaged per month. Chain length (CL) measures the length of conversational chains be-tween the dyad averaged per month. Intuitively, high CF or CL for a dyad means the relationship is strong. 2.3 Self-Disclosure Social psychology literature asserts that self-disclosure consists of personal information and open communication composed of the following five ele-ments (Montgomery, 1982).

Negative openness is how much disagreement or negative feeling one expresses about a situation or the communicative partner. In Twitter conver-sations, we analyze sentiment using the aspect and sentiment unification model (ASUM) (Jo and Oh, 2011), based on LDA (Blei et al., 2003). ASUM uses a set of seed words for an unsupervised dis-covery of sentiments. We use positive and negative emoticons from Wikipedia.org 1 . Nonverbal open-ness includes facial expressions, vocal tone, bod-ily postures or movements. Since tweets do not show these, we look at emoticons,  X  X ol X  (laughing out loud) and  X  X xx X  (kisses) for these nonverbal ele-ments. According to Derks et al. (2007), emoticons are used as substitutes for facial expressions or vocal tones in socio-emotional contexts. We also consider profanity as nonverbal openness. The methodology used for identifying profanity is described in the next section. Emotional openness is how much one dis-closes his/her feelings and moods. To measure this, we look for tweets that contain words that are iden-tified as the most common expressions of feelings in blogs as found in Harris and Kamvar (2009). Recep-tive openness and General-style openness are diffi-cult to get from tweets, and they are not defined pre-cisely in the literature, so we do not consider these here. 2.4 PII, PEI, and Profanity PII and PEI are also important elements of self-disclosure. Automatically identifying these is quite difficult, but there are certain topics that are indica-tive of PII and PEI, such as family , money , sick-ness and location , so we can use a widely-used topic model, LDA (Blei et al., 2003) to discover topics and annotate them using MTurk 2 for PII and PEI, and profanity. We asked the Turkers to read the con-versation chains representing the topics discovered by LDA and have them mark the conversations that contain PII and PEI. From this annotation, we iden-tified five topics for profanity, ten topics for PII, and eight topics for PEI. Fleiss kappa of MTurk result is 0.07 for PEI, and 0.10 for PII, and those numbers signify slight agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977). Table 1 shows some of the PII and PEI topics. The profanity words identified this way include nigga, lmao, shit, fuck, lmfao, ass, bitch .

To verify the topic-model based approach to dis-covering PII and PEI, we tried supervised classifi-cation using SVM on document-topic proportions. Precision and recall are 0.23 and 0.21 for PII, and 0.30 and 0.23 for PEI. These results are not quite good, but this is a difficult task even for humans, and we had a low agreement among the Turkers. So our current work is in improving this. Chain frequency (CF) and chain length (CL) reflect the dyad X  X  tweeting behaviors. In figure 1, we can see that the two metrics show similar patterns of self-disclosure. When two users have stronger rela-tionships, they show more negative openness, non-verbal openness, profanity, and PEI. These patterns are expected. However, weaker relationships tend to show more PII and emotions. A closer look at the data reveals that PII topics are related to cities where they live, time of day, and birthday. This shows that the weaker relationships, usually new acquain-tances, use PII to introduce themselves or send triv-ial greetings for birthdays. Higher emotional open-ness in weaker relationships looks strange at first, but similar to PII, emotion in weak relationships is usually expressed as greetings, reactions to baby or pet photos, or other shallow expressions.

It is interesting to look at outliers, dyads with very strong and very weak relationship groups. Table 3 summarizes the self-disclosure behaviors of these outliers. There is a clear pattern that stronger re-lationships show more nonverbal openness, nega-tive openness, profanity use, and PEI. In figure 1, emotional openness does not differ for the strong and weak relationship groups. We can see why this is when we look at the topics for the strong and weak groups. Table 2 shows the topics that are most prominent in the strong relationships, and they include daily greetings, plans, nonverbal emotions such as  X  X ol X ,  X  X mg X , and profanity. In weak relation-ships, the prominent topics illustrate the prevalence of initial getting-to-know conversations in Twitter. They welcome and greet each other about kids and pets, and offer sympathies about feeling bad.
One interesting way to use our analysis is in iden-tifying a rare situation that deviates from the gen-eral pattern, such as a dyad linked weakly but shows high self-disclosure. We find several such examples, most of which are benign, but some do show signs of risk for one of the parties. In figure 2, we show an example of a conversation with a high degree of self-disclosure by a dyad who shares only one con-versation in our dataset spanning two months. We looked at the relationship strength in Twitter conversational partners and how much they self-disclose to each other. We found that people dis-close more to closer friends, confirming the social psychology studies, but people show more positive sentiment to weak relationships rather than strong relationships. This reflects the social norm toward first-time acquaintances on Twitter. Also, emotional openness does not change significantly with rela-tionship strength. We think this may be due to the in-herent difficulty in truly identifying the emotions on Twitter. Identifying emotion merely based on key-words captures mostly shallow emotions, and deeper emotional openness either does not occur much on Twitter or cannot be captures very well.

With our automatic analysis, we showed that when Twitter users have conversations, they con-trol self-disclosure depending on the relationship strength. We showed the results of measuring the re-lationship strength of a Twitter conversational dyad with chain frequency and length. We also showed the results of automatically analyzing self-disclosure behaviors using topic modeling.

This is ongoing work, and we are looking to im-prove methods for analyzing relationship strength and self-disclosure, especially emotions, PII and PEI. For relationship strength, we will consider not only interaction frequency, but also network distance and relationship duration. For finding emotions, first we will adapt existing models (Vaassen and Daele-mans, 2011; Tokuhisa et al., 2008) and suggest a new semi-supervised model. For finding PII and PEI, we will not only consider the topics, but also time, place and the structure of questions and an-swers.
