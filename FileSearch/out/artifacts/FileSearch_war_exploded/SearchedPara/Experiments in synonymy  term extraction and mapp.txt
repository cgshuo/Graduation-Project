 The meta-thesaurus UMLS is a multi-lingual col-lection of biomedical vocabularies which include concepts associated to Semantic Types (provided by the Semantic Network) and defined with one or more terms synonyms or term variations 1 . The thesaurus is by and large populated with terms from the English language, while other major lan-guages such as Portuguese are lagging behind in terms of volume and quality. This work is a first step to overcome this state of affairs, by inves-tigating how far a small to medium size corpus, combined with an automated approach based on distributional semantics and limited human inter-vention, can provide new terms to be included in the Portuguese section of the thesaurus (UMLS-POR). A good review of pattern-based approaches to semantic relation extraction can be found in (Auger and Barri ` ere, 2008), while (Hamon and Grabar, 2008) offers a good example of an ap-proach tapping on existing terminology to bring out the synonymy relations between words. Here we focus on simple terms. The Genomics corpus (GENOMICA) was com-piled at CLUL (Centro de Lingu  X   X stica da Uni-versidade de Lisboa) during 2003 and 2004. The GENOMICA corpus comprises 611 texts with 1,086,772 tokens and 66,817 words for a word/token ratio of 6.15%. The corpus has been tokenized, tagged for part-of-speeches and lem-matized using a tool we developed at CLUL. The identification of relevant texts for inclusion in the corpus was a challenge since few texts in this area of knowledge are actually produced in Portuguese. While geneticists mostly write their publications in English, in international conferences and jour-nals, genomic knowledge has to be accessible to Portuguese speakers, laymen or students. We re-lied on the help of a Portuguese geneticist to locate materials in Portuguese and also to validate the texts as belonging to the area of genetics and ge-nomics. The corpus includes scientific abstracts, papers and books, PhD dissertations, documents from the Portuguese Society for Human Genetics, excerpts from courses in genetics, support materi-als for students taking genetics courses, legal text and Supreme Court rulings on genomics, articles and book for scientific dissemination as well as two newspapers interviews with a Portuguese ge-neticist. A small sample of the corpus consists of transcriptions of spoken data: one faculty class, one conference and one interview (around 11,000 tokens). Four texts are translations to Portuguese, a total of 39,058 tokens. Given the rather modest size of our corpus, and to alleviate the problem of sparse data, we have decided to normalize terms from UMLS and GENOMICA to lower-case. These experiments are about term extraction and concept mapping. Our objective is to extract from the GENOMICA corpus salient terms pertaining to the domain of genomics and map them to con-cepts from the UMLS-POR. Terms extracted and mapped are validated by humans. The experimen-tal flow-chart, including extraction and mapping, is shown in figure 1. The approaches adopted are not novel, but their combination may be.
 3.1 Extracting salient terms from the corpus To extract relevant terms from GENOMICA, that is terms belonging to the field of genomics, we use an approach that computes the salience of terms based on log-odd ratio. The log-odd ratio com-pares the frequency of terms in a specialized cor-pus (GENOMICA) with that in a reference (gen-eral) corpus. High positive values indicates strong salience. We used a random subset of 10,416 files from the CRPC (Reference Corpus of Contempo-rary Portuguese) as reference corpus 2 . Our subset comprises 8,916,910 tokens for 175,220 words, a word/token ratio of 2.0%.

We asked our human expert, a geneticist, to re-view the top 2,000 terms we extracted from GE-NOMICA and labelled them as either  X  X es X  (for a term definitely belonging to genomics),  X  X aybe X  or  X  X o X . The labelling task outcome was 1,403  X  X es X , 115  X  X aybe X  and 482  X  X o X , so a preci-sion of 70% (1,403/2,000). Somewhat surpris-ingly, given that the UMLS-POR comprises a total of 23,350 terms distributed in 16,491 concepts, we find that only a small fraction (21%) of the terms extracted from GENOMICA and labelled  X  X es X  are already present in UMLS-POR, which indi-cates that the thesaurus is in need of an update. We tackle the task of assigning some of the remain-ing extracted terms labelled  X  X es X  not already in UMLS-POR to an appropriate UMLS concept in the next section. 3.2 Mapping: approach and evaluation We undertake the task of assigning automati-cally new terms to UMLS-POR using a VSM ap-proach comparing the contexts of occurrences of terms. VSMs are built around word-context ma-trices where rows are words (terms) to compare and columns are words used as context (context-words) for the comparison. Context-words are any words (with the exception of stopwords) neigh-bouring a term. Our approach is typical of VSM and can be summarized as follows: we count oc-currences of context-words around each term and then compute the cosine distance between any pair of terms, assuming that words with the same con-texts are closer in meaning.

Contexts are usually defined as words surround-ing each term. In our case, the context can be more specifically parametrized by size and form. By size we mean the window size, how many words on each side of a term we are considering. By form we refer to either word-form or lemma. Another parameter to consider is the scoring method, how you count the number of occurrences of context-words around a term. We look at parameter tuning in the next section. 3.2.1 Parameter tuning
The first step in building matrices for VSM in-volves tuning parameters. We experimented with different values for three parameters: the window size, the scoring system and the form for context-words. We tested these parameters for twelve terms from five different concepts as found in the ULMS-POR (see table 1).

After building a matrix for all twelve terms summarizing their  X  X ehaviour X  (scores) in GE-NOMICA, we computed the distances between 182

Af-ter numerous trials, we found that a window size of two (on each side of the term), counting each occurrence as 1 (without consideration for loca-tion within the window) and the use of word-form give the best result. The clustering obtained with these values for the three parameters set as above is shown in figure 2. The clusters mirror very closely the memberships between terms and con-cepts. The same settings are therefore used for the rest of the experiments.

It is worth mentioning that other works have also found that the immediate context of a word is more important than the distant context for de-termining the meaning of a word. In (Rapp, 2003), a window size of two words was used to achieve 92.5% correct on the 80 TOEFL questions. 3.2.2 Preliminary evaluation and search
Before we assign concepts to terms extracted from GENOMICA, we thought useful to get an evaluation on how effective VSM can be in as-signing concepts to terms which are extracted di-rectly from UMLS-POR, and for which we know to which concept they belong. For example, as we have seen in table 1, the concept C0006159 ( the production of animals or plants by selective pair-ing ) lists three synonyms in the thesaurus: cruza-mento , procriac  X   X  ao and gerac  X   X  ao . Each synonym may appear a certain number of times in GENOM-ICA. The idea is to evaluate the distance computed using VSM for synonyms but also unrelated word-pairs in relation to their frequency in GENOM-ICA. Table 2 presents this evaluation.
 frequency pairs size [ 41,  X  ] 55.1 71.8 36
For example, when we compute the average co-sine distance between two synonyms each with frequency (in GENOMICA) between 2 and 5, we find 86.5, while two unrelated words have a dis-tance of 92.8. The results are consistent with the fact that semantic distance is smaller for syn-onyms appearing often in GENOMICA, for which a more reliable statistical model can be built.
Our objective is to compute distance between terms and concepts, so we can assign, as reliably as possible, each term a concept. Therefore, we computed the distance between 26 terms already in UMLS-POR and 329 concepts 4 . After ranking distances from lowest to highest, we found that in 38% of cases, the correct concept can be found among the top 3%. This finding will help our hu-man expert reduce the search space while review-ing new extracted terms. 3.3 Assigning UMLS concepts to extracted This task is complicated by the fact that there is no guarantee that there exists a relevant concept in the thesaurus. In such cases, we should not find any strong association between the term and con-cepts, which in practice translates to short cosine distances as computed by the VSM. Let us also recognize that not all semantic types defined in UMLS are relevant for genomics. According to (Cohen et al., 2007), the relevant semantic types are Gene or Genome , Nucleic Acid , Nucleoside or Nucleotide , Biologically Active Substance , Idea or Concept , Cell Component , Amino Acid , Peptide or Nucleotide , Genomic Function and their sub-hierarchies 5 . If we name the semantic types men-tioned previously UMLS-GENOMICS-POR, then we are left with a set 3,854 terms distributed in 2,907 concepts, compared with the full UMLS-POR (23,350 terms distributed in 16,491 con-cepts).
 Finally, we can set out to assign concepts from UMLS-POR (UMLS-GENOMICS-POR) to ex-tracted terms from GENOMICA which do not cur-rently exist in the thesaurus. In the previous sec-tion we saw that a frequency of at least 41 was a good threshold for building a fairly reliable statis-tical model. To satisfy this constraint, we must reduce our UMLS-POR (UMLS-GENOMICS-POR) search space from 16,491 (2,907) concepts to 330 (96). Our final task is to assign the top (i.e. with the highest log-odd ratio) 141 (135) terms labelled  X  X es X  (and with frequency &gt; 40) by our human expert to one of the 330 (96) con-cepts. Our human assessor reviewed the rank-ing provided by our VSM and found that the cor-rect match was often found substantially below the top 3% ranked terms for UMLS-POR (UMLS-GENOMICS-POR), limiting the usefulness of the approach and requiring a prohibitively high hu-man expertise and revision. However, when we looked solely at the average distance calculated by VSM, we observed that genomic terms are on average 67% closer to concepts from UMLS-POR (UMLS-GENOMICS-POR) than terms out-side the field of genomics. This shows that the ap-proach is good, but yet not good enough for prac-tical purposes. Given a reference corpus with a decent size and coverage, the extraction of salient terms from a specialized genomic corpus, albeit small, can be achieved with good precision (70%). Mapping those relevant terms to a set of predefined concepts from the UMLS thesaurus turned out to be much more difficult, as human validation required for the proposed ranking would be excessive. Given that the approach gives fairly good results on eas-ier tasks, we believe that a larger corpus and the inclusion of methods developed elsewhere for the treatment of term variations should alleviate hu-man intervention and render the approach more efficient. It should also be interesting to investi-gate in which respect heterogeneity plus scarcity of texts, but also how human intervention have impacted the results. A Portuguese version of Wordnet is also available 6 , if needed. We are cur-rently working on extracting and mapping com-plex terms.
