 From previous studies, we believe that search behaviour on touch-enabled mobile devices is different from the behaviour with desktop screens. In the proposed research, we intend to explore user interaction while searching with the aim of improving search experience on mobile devices.

Several studies have compared user behaviour and search performance between a desktop monitor and a mobile device (e.g., [3]), and it is believed that search engine developers need to provide a different presentation design for mobile web search. However, one remarkable trend of mobile de-vices is their enlargement of screen sizes during last a few years. Compared to early smartphones which have screens less than 4 inches across (diagonal), recently smartphones or phablets (a combined word of phone and tablet) have about 4.5 inches and over 5.5 inches, respectively. This led us to look for differences in search behaviour on different small screens, and if there are any, to suggest better presentation of search results for each screen size. Briefly, we found that participants in our experiment exhibited different search be-haviours: less eye-movement within top links on the larger screen, fast reading with some hesitation before choosing a link on the medium, and frequent use of scrolling on the small screen. With this result, we suggested several ideas for presentation design for each screen size [4].

There are a number of studies which have investigated user interaction with search engine result pages (SERPs), and many of them indicated that the use of scrolling is closely related search behaviour (e.g., [2]), although peo-ple must still scroll through SERPs to see beyond the page folds. To the best of our knowledge, vertical scrolling is the only way to control viewport while searching, and is provided by all search engines. Because people are famil-iar with turning page horizontally when they read a book, and when controlling applications which provide horizontal switching interface (e.g., weather and shopping), it is worth investigating the effect of horizontal and vertical viewport control types ( pagination versus scrolling ) in mobile web search. This work has been completed, and our findings suggest that participants using pagination were more likely to find relevant documents despite spending less time on the SERPs overall.

Researchers have studied user interaction under manipu-lated elements of SERPs (e.g., length of snippets and rank order [1]) to investigate the effects of the contents on desk-top monitors. Compared to effects on the desktop screens, searching with smartphones may be more affected by the el-ements of SERPs due to the smaller space to display search results. In addition, Google has started providing a mobile indicator, providing a small mark indicating that an item on a search results page links to a mobile optimized page instead of a full-size page for desktops as suggested by our earlier work [3]. We are currently investigating how the el-ements of SERPs interact with searchers, and how much these provide a better search experience, on small screens. [1] E. Cutrell and Z. Guan.
