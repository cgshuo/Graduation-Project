PHAROS 1 [1] is an Integrated Project aimed at build-ing a platform for advanced audiovisual search applications. The Consortium comprises 12 partners from 9 European countries. 2 PHAROS unbundles the functionalities of an audiovisual search engine into an open service-based ecosys-tem, where content can be submitted to customized anal-ysis pipelines, third-party annotation components can be plugged-in, and content based search engines can be regis-tered. PHAROS enables a variety of application scenarios, from content acquisition and enrichment, to annotation fu-sion, to multi-modal queries. Figure 1 shows the architec-ture of PHAROS, which supports two main process: Content Caption and Refinement (CCR) executes flow of operators on the captured content and produces XML metadata (sub-sequently indexed by a core XML search engine) and derived artifacts(used for similarity querying and result presenta-tion); Query Execution and Result Presentation (QUIRP) accepts a user X  X  query (by keyword, by image similarity, by audio similarity, by video similarity), expands it with user X  X  profile and social information, brokers its execution on the registered search engines, and presents results in a Rich In-ternet Interface.

The demo exploits the online access to the PHAROS plat-form for an in-depth tour of: content acquisition, design and http://www.pharos-audiovisual-search.eu Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A.
