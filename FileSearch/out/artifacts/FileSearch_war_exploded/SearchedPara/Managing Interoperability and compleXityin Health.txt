 Managing Interoperability and Complexity in Health Sys-tems, MIXHS'11, aims to be a forum focussing on recent re-search and technical results in knowledge management and information systems in bio-medical and electronic health systems. The workshop will provide an opportunity for sharing practical experiences and best practices in e-Health information infrastructure development and management. Of particular interest to the workshop themes are technical solutions to recurring practical systems deployment issues, including harnessing the complexity of bio-medical domain knowledge and the interoperability of heterogeneous health systems. The workshop will gather experts, researchers, system developers, practitioners and policymakers design-ing and implementing solutions for managing clinical data and integrating existing and future electronic health systems infrastructures.

The volume of clinical data available to patients, profes-sionals and health systems is expanding exponentially, while health systems resources are being rationalised and services transformed in order to deal with unprecedented epidemi-ological shifts in populations and diseases patterns. Pa-tients live longer, with multiple complex morbidities, receiv-ing multiple pharmaceutical treatments which interaction is not well understood. Health professionals are providing care and treatments while often having to manage the in-creased complexity of technology and the specialisation of medical disciplines. Relentless updates in clinical knowl-edge, as well as fast-paced technological innovations lead to feelings of knowledge saturation and information overload for the health professionals involved in the multi-disciplinary medical team. At the same time, patients' expectations of safety and quality of healthcare and medical services provi-sion are also increasing.
 The Managing Interoperability and Complexity in Health Systems workshop will provide an opportunity for sharing practical experiences and best practices in e-health informa-tion infrastructure development and management. The fo-rum will appeal to academics and researchers in information and knowledge management, clinical standards developers and e-health systems implementers as well as public health policymakers, and to both local and international audiences.
Issues of biomedical data-mining in large heterogeneous clinical data-sets, information retrieval and extraction in multiple medical repositories, the management of complex-ity and the coherent update of knowledge in medicine, clin-ical standards interoperability in distributed health systems and the patient Electronic Health Record (EHR) are now be-coming critical to implementing enterprise and nationwide health systems.

Topics of interest to the workshop include knowledge man-agement activities seeking to address these issues by: (i) using clinical data mining, information extraction and re-trieval, (ii) standardisation of clinical classi cation (e.g. In-ternational Classi cation of Diseases, ICD), large scale bio-medical terminologies and ontologies (e.g. SNOMED-CT), (iii) the standardisation of clinical information transfer for-mats (e.g. HL7) and (iv) EHR and the structuring of clinical documents (e.g. Clinical Document Architecture, CDA). The workshop keynote speaker is Paul Woolman, (C.Eng, CITP, MIPEM, FBCS) , Enterprise Architect for the Scot-tish Government e-Health programme and chairman of the NHSScotland Interoperability Working Group. 1 Woolman has worked on the challenges of interoperability in medi-cal systems for over twenty years: he has worked on EU and ISO standards in medical devices interoperability, and estab-lished the Scottish Health XML Steering Group, which de-veloped web services standards now widely in use in NHSS-cotland and other parts of the UK. He currently chairs the Scottish Interoperability working group and coordinates the NHS Scotland Ensemble User Group as part of his Enter-prise Architecture work for the Scottish Government. He is a regular speaker at international forums on eHealth topics. Woolman's presentation at the MIX-HS workshop will focus on the:  X  X hallenges of managing interoperability in regional healthcare organisations X
