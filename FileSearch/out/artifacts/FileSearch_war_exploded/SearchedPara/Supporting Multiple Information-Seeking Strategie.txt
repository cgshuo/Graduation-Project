 This paper reports on an experi ment comparing the retrieval effectiveness of an integrated interactive information retrieval (IIR) system which adapts to support different information-seeking strategies, with that of a standard baseline IIR system. The experiment, with 32 subjects each searching on 8 different topics, indicates that using the integrated IIR system resulted in significantly better performance, in cluding user satisfaction with search results, significantly more effective interaction, and significantly better usability than using the baseline system. H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval  X  search process. Design, Experimentati on, Human Factors. Scanning, searching, adaptive info rmation retrieval, interactive information retrieval, personalization It has been clear for some years that people engage in a variety of different information-seeking stra tegies (ISSs) when engaged in information systems, and also that standard interactive information retrieval (IIR) syst ems are designed to support only one such strategy, specified searching for one or more items. Although there have been some attempts to design systems (or to propose frameworks for systems) which will support more than one ISS (e.g. [4] [11]), for the most part this issue has been ignored in both research and ope rational IIR systems. It seems that this situation is due predomin antly to three factors: a lack of recognition of the problem itself; the lack of a theoretical structure which might provide a framework within which multiple ISSs could be supported; and, the inherent difficulty of the task itself. This paper reports on an experiment which compares an integrated IIR system which adapts to support different ISSs within a single information-seeki ng episode, with a rather generic IIR, modeled on standard operationa l IIR systems and designed to support searching through query specification. The integrated system is based on an explicit model of IIR which attempts to relate various characteristics of the user in the system, including the user X  X  context, to different ISSs in which the person might engage, and to relate the differe nt ISSs to one another in a systematic way. In the following sections, we describe the theoretical basis for the integrated IIR, discuss related wo rk, describe the two systems and the experiment, present and disc uss its results, and draw some conclusions based on those results. Belkin and colleagues suggested in [4] that the variety of people X  X  ISSs could be captured by a cla ssification scheme consisting of four binary-valued facets (Figure 1). These facets were derived from an analysis of the information seeking and information retrieval literatures. Their claim was that a given ISS could be characterized by a specific combination of values of the four facets, yielding 16 distinct ISSs, in what they characterized as a  X  X pace of ISSs X . On the basis of these facets, the idea of a searcher moving from one ISS to another in this space, and a two-level hypertext IR model, they proposed a design for an IIR system which could support both  X  X  rowsing X  and  X  X uerying X . Method of Seeking (Scanning; Searching) Goal of Seeking (Learning; Selecting) Mode of Seeking (Recognition; Specification) Resource Interacted with (Information; Meta-information) Figure 1. Facets of Information-Seeking Strategies (after [4]) Subsequently, Cool and Belk in [6] extended this model somewhat, based on an empirical study of knowledge workers. Figure 2 displays the relevant facets from [6], and their values, which are the basis for the description of ISSs used in our study. In particular, in the work reported here, we differentiated between two basic classes of ISSs; those characterized by the method of searching , and those characterized by the method of scanning , within the specific information behavior of access . Information Behavior Facet (This facet includes a variety of different types of such behavior s; for this study reported here, only the  X  X ccess X  behavior was considered.) Access Objects Interacted with Facet Common Dimensions of Interaction Facet Interaction Criteria Facet Figure 2. A faceted classification of ISSs (based on [6]) Belkin [2] proposed that an info rmation-seeking episode could be construed as a sequence of differe nt types of interactions with information, or different ISSs, each of which could be  X  X ptimally X  supported by different combina tions of various retrieval techniques (see Figure 3). Thus, th ere would be different choices of representation, comparison, etc. techniques, for best support of implementation of support technique s for different ISSs in our experimental integrated IIR system. Figure 3. A model of support fo r different interactions with information, or ISSs (after [2]) It is widely recognized that tr aditional information systems based solely on searching leave room for improvement. Some work has been done to investigate the possibilities of integrating separate IR systems, separate retrieval models, or multiple ISSs into a single system framework. Frisse and Cousins [8] developed a system which integrated hypertext and probabilistic retrieval models. Hearst et al. [9] combined a browsing system, a vector-space best-match retrieval system, and a visualization system into one system. However, it is difficult to optimally support different ISSs by completely integrating two different models, and combining originally separate systems makes it hard to use the results related to one ISS to support another. Croft and Thompson [12] proposed a system which supported both browsing and specified search. Belkin, Marchetti, and Cool [4] designed an IR interface (BRAQUE) which supported multiple ISSs and allowed seamless movement from one specific ISS to another. In 1995, Belkin, Cool, Stein and Thiel [3] designed a dialogue-based interactive system, MERIT, which supported several ISSs and structur ed changes of ISSs in a mixed-initiative dialogue. All these systems made an effort to integrate multiple ISSs in a single framework, but their effectiveness remains to be evaluated empirically. The ScentTrails method devel oped by Olston and Chi [11] integrated browsing and searching to help people get information on the web. It used hyperlink highlighting to indicate paths to search results so people can easily integrate browsing and searching. This method was evaluated in a preliminary user study whose results showed that it allo wed people to locate information more quickly than by searching or browsing alone. However, due to the small sample size (twelve subjects), the generalizability of the results is unclear, and the me thod remains to be implemented and tested in a larger context. In order to test whether an in tegrated IIR system would better support people in their informati on seeking than a non-integrated IIR system, we began by identifying  X  X roto-typical X  problematic situations, or information problem s, or tasks, which we believed would lead people to engage in a variety of ISSs. In the following sub-sections, we identify two such tasks, describe how a person indicate the relationships betw een these ISSs and corresponding support techniques which, in comb ination, we hypothesize would support them well (using the framework of Figure 3). These two general tasks were used as the basis for the ten specific topics that were given to subj ects in our experiment, and the support techniques were the basis of the integrated system design. Task 1: A person is very interested in one particular topic. S/he wants to find some good documents on this topic from a system which is composed of several databases. But s/he has no idea about which of the many possible databases to search. Description: Given this situati on, this person needs to first scan the whole system to identify the be st databases for one particular topic, then conduct a systematic search on those databases on a specific topic. This person needs to compare the descriptions of the contents of different databases in order to choose the appropriate ones. Since the pers on does not know which databases are good, s/he needs to scan the meta-information of the databases in order to recognize the best databases. In order to get some meta-information of the databases, s/he issues a query. That query would be compared using a best match technique against the index terms associated with each database. The meta-information then is displayed by representing the database by the posting frequency of the index terms. Each database is summarized by the number of documents indexed by the terms in the query, and by some descriptions of the cont ents based on most frequently indexed terms. By doing this, a pe rson could easily see how topics are covered in the databases and how they are related to each other. This representation will a llow the person to easily compare the different databases and decide which ones look more interesting by scrolling through them. Next, the person needs to conduct a systematic search within one or multiple database(s) for the specific topic in order to find documents of interest. The pers on needs to formulate a query based on the given task. The query would be compared using a best match technique against th e index terms associated with chosen databases. The results of the query can be represented by clustering because clustering shows the relationship among the documents, as well as the relati onship between documents in the clusters and query terms or other terms that might turn out to be useful. Query-based clusters (that is, clusters customized to reflect the information problem described in a query) would be displayed because it is known that clustered displays in terms of topicality are useful to help people locate rele vant information (cf. [10]). It is also believed that clusters can tell the person what is the relationship between different cluste rs in the specific database at a glance. To accomplish this, we need to get the retrieval results and cluster them. Each cluster has a short summary about the number of documents in each cluster, and number of documents tailored to the particular topic. Now the person can decide which clusters are desirable and then drill down to the documents within the clusters. From our theoretical framework (Figure 3), an information-seeking behavior can be seen as the movement from one ISS to another ISS; different combina tions of support techniques could optimally support a given type of I SS. In this task, a combination of such support techniques as best match, summary of database, indexing and scrolling are used to support a scanning-based ISS. A combination of support techni ques, such as best match, clustering, clustered retrieval re sults display, and following link are used to support a searching-based ISS. The interactions between the user and the system are related to the situation, tasks, goals, etc. Task 2: A person is in the process of preparing a talk for a conference. S/he recalls some germane comments from a known electronic book but cannot remember the exact contents. S/he needs to find out the exact quotations. S/he recalls that a certain electronic book might be very helpful. But she cannot exactly remember the name of the book. Description: Given this situati on, this person first needs to search on the system to find the book, then scan through the book to get the comments needed. This person has a vague recollection about a book that s/he saw. S/he needs to improve her/his knowledge of some characteristics of the book, su ch as author, title, etc. Thus, s/he might need to search the system on terminological fragments of those data elements. In this situation, it would be good to give the person an opportunity to see something about the different characteristics of the book that s/he might remember. The items in the database, catalog or electronic books would be indexed to support a best match technique within different fields such as title, author, date, publisher, publication place, etc. The retrieved results will be displayed as a co mplete citation. Then the person can see the table of contents of each book by following links of each citation. Next, since the person has only a general idea about the quotation, s/he needs to scan through the meta-information to identify some candidate quotation page. This person might look initially at the table of contents of the book to look for places where the quotations might occur. Then s/he goes to those pages and scans through them roughly to see if th e desired quotations are there and, if so, record the quotations. In this task, a combination of such support techniques as table of contents visualization, and scrolling are used to support a scanning-based ISS. A combinati on of such support techniques as best match, indexing, fielded que ry search and following links are used to support a searching-based ISS. The interactions between the user and the system are related to the situation, tasks, goals, etc. Both the baseline system and the integrated system were indexing, passage i ndexing, structured-query retrieval and document clustering. As test co llections, we used the 2004 TREC HARD collection of eight news data bases (see [1] for details], and a specially prepared database of 50 books downloaded from The specific different combinations of support techniques for the integrated system were tested to learn whether each separately was effective for supporting the individual ISSs. Results of those experiments indicated that they were indeed superior to the baseline system [13]. Both the baseline and integrated system have the same general interface structure. They begin with an introductory screen, asking the user to choose one of several functionalities. Choosing one leads to a screen which has a query box and  X  X earch X  button at the top, a large results display area, a column on the right, the top of which displays the topic, the bottom being a space for saving results, and a horizontal bar across the bottom of the screen with navigation buttons for returning (or going) to other screens. Our baseline system used the default LEMUR parameters for indexing, comparison and ranking. Because of the nature of the tasks, and the two different data bases, the opening screen offers the choice of searching for books on a specific topic, or searching for news articles on a specific topic. Having chosen, the searcher arrives at the appropriate search/results screen, and enters a query. The only difference between the book and news-article choice is that in the former, the paragra phs of the books are the indexed units, and all paragraphs in all books are ranked; in the latter, the entire article is the indexed unit, and all databases in the news collection are searched. In the book version, the first line of each paragraph is displayed; in the ne ws-article, the title is displayed. In both cases, the source (book; database) is also displayed. Clicking on first line or title displays the full paragraph or article; clicking on source displays the ranked list of paragraphs in the book, or the ranked list of articles retrieved from the specific database. Figure 4 shows a news-a rticle retrieval result for the baseline system. Figure 4. Baseline system, news-article retrieval result The integrated system begins with a screen containing four choices: (a) learning about the da tabases; (b) learning about the content coverage of databases with respect to a given topic; (c) searching for books on a specific topic; (d) searching for news articles on a specific topic. Choosing (a) leads to a search/r esults screen which lists the names of the databases and the number of documents in each. This includes the book database. The user can select one or more of the databases and enter a query which searches in those choices. If news article databases are chosen, the results of the search are displayed as a list of clusters, with highly-ranked cluster terms as a label, listing th e first three titles of each cluster (Figure 5). Clicking on cluster link displays a ranked list of all (maximum of 30) titles and their sources in the cluster. Clicking on a title in either the cluster or subsequent list display shows the entire article; clicking on a sour ce in the list shows the ranked results for the query for that database. If the book database is chosen, the query results in a ranke d list of complete citations of the retrieved books; clicking on a book leads to a display of the table of contents of the book in a column on the left of the screen. Clicking on one of the items in the table of contents displays that part of the book. (Figure 6). Choosing option (b) leads to a scr een which lists ten queries, each related to one of the eight test topics, and the two training topics. The user chooses one of these, which leads to a search/results screen. In the news-article tasks, this lists each database, and the number of occurrences of each query term in that database (Figure 7). The user can then choose one or more databases on which to do subsequent searches, or go directly to one database. In both cases, the result is a display as in Figure 5. For a book task, the search/results scr een shows the number of books retrieved for each query term. Figure 5. Integrated system, clustered results display Figure 6. Integrated system, b ook table of contents display Figure 7. Integrated system, database summary display Choosing option (c), searching for books on a topic, leads to a fielded search/results screen. The user enters values in the fields to perform a query; the results (complete citations) are displayed according to how well they satisfy the Boolean conditions of the query (Figure 8). Clicking on any citation leads to the display of Figure 6. Figure 8. Integrated system, book search results display Choosing option (d) leads the user directly to the search/results screen shown in Figure 5. The underlying hypothesis for this experiment is: The integrated system designed for supporting s canning and searching performs better in supporting integrated tasks requiring both scanning and searching than the baseline system. This was a within-subject design, in which subjects performed searches using each of the two systems, first one system, then the other. For each system, subjects first performed a search on a training topic, then searched on f our different topics. These four topics belong to two task categorie s, that is, finding news-article task and finding comments task, as described in Section 3. The first test topic was of the same task type as the training topic, the second topic was of the other task type, and so on. The order of the task types and topics was rotated across subjects and the experiment was replicated by exchanging the order of the two systems. This design led to 32 subjects. Table 1. Demographic characteristics of the subjects Characteristics Value No. Age Current Major Thirty-two Rutgers university graduate students participated in this experiment. Demographic characteristics of the subjects are shown in Table 1. Computer and information searching experience were determined in a entry questionnaire, using a 7-point scale, with 1=low, and 7=hi gh. Those data are displayed in Table 2. Table 2.

Number of years of searching experience 7.34 (2.24) Each of the two different tasks has five topics, including one as the training topic, all following th e same general structures as described in Sections 3.2 and 3. 3. Below, we give an example topic for each task type. Task type 1: (Finding documents) Topic: As a graduate student, y ou are asked to write an essay about high blood pressure for one of your courses. You are supposed to get information you need from a system that is composed of several databases. E ach database has lots of news articles on a variety of topics, but you have no idea which databases are good on this topi c. You believe it would be interesting to discover methods that reduce high blood pressure, and would like to collect news articles that identify different methods. Task: Please find as many different methods as possible. For each method, please copy the title or link of the article which discusses that method, and paste it to the answer box. For each article that you copy, please type or copy the method(s) that it identifies. If an article discusses more than one method, you only need to copy and paste the article once. If there are several articles which discuss the same methods, you onl y need to copy and paste one such article. Task type 2: (Finding comments) Topic: You are in the process of preparing a talk on the history of Rome. There are a lot of books available on this topic. But what you are interested in are the wars of Julius Caesar. You recall that some comments from an electronic book might be very useful for the talk. You cannot remember the exact name of the book. But you believe that it was published by a publisher in New York. The comments are about the strategies that Caesar used on the battle field to win the Battle of Pharsalia. You cannot remember the exact comments, but would lik e to quote them in your talk. Task: Please find the relevant comments from the book, copy the one best paragraph then paste it into the answer box. Also, please copy the title of the book then paste it to the answer box. Log data, including the interaction between the user and the system were collected using the computer logs and a logging software,  X  X echsmith Morae 1.3 X . Morae was also used to record what the user said during the whole search process, as well as the exit interview. An entry questi onnaire gathered demographic and other background information; a pr e-search questionnaire elicited information about subjects X  knowledge of the topic; a post-search questionnaire elicited opinions about the particular search; a post-system questionnaire collected opi nions about the specific system; and, an exit interview compared search experience and opinions of the two systems. When subjects arrived, they completed an informed consent form, which included detailed instructi ons about the experiment, and then the entry questionnaire. Next, they were given a training topic to practice with the first system they would use. Then, for each topic, they filled out a pre-search questionnaire, conducted the search and saved the answers in the given place. When they felt that a satisfactory answer was saved, or they ran out of time (subjects had up to 12 minutes per search), they answered a brief post-search questionnaire. This procedure continued until four topics in the first system were completed, after which they filled out a post-system questionnaire and were given a three-minute break. The same procedure was followed for the next set of topics using the second system, after whic h the exit interview was given. Each subject was paid $30 cash equivalent value (gift card/cash) after completing the experiment. The measures of performance were the time taken to complete the task; the subjects X  satisfaction with their results; the correctness of the results (incorrect, partially correct, correct); and, aspectual recall. Aspectual recall and correctness were the performance measures for task type 1 and task type 2, respectively. Time was determined through logging, satis faction with results though the post-search questionnaires, on a s cale of 1 (unsatisfied) to 7 (completely satisfied); correctness was determined by the investigators, according to the ta sk definition, and was graded on a 3-point scale, 0-2; and aspectual recall was determined by pooling all of the aspects identified for each topic by all of the subjects. Aspectual recall, a measure developed in the TREC Interactive Track (cf. [7]), is th e ratio of aspects of the search topic identified in the documents sa ved by the subject, to the total number of aspects of the topic. Table 3 displays the performance results. Significance tests were through ANOVA, Wilcoxon Signed-rank, Pearson Chi-square, and ANOVA tests, respectively. For result satisfaction, the deta ils are: Z=-2.633, p=0.008; for aspectual recall: F=6.951, p=0. 009. Although result correctness difference between the baseline and integrated system is not significant, it is in favor of the integrated system. Time for the integrated system is slightly more than the baseline system, but the difference is not significant. Table 3. Performance measures (** significant at &lt;.01 level) Judgment of result correctness for task type 2 topics was accomplished by constructing the topics so that there was only one paragraph in the book database which provided a completely correct answer; paragraphs which had only some required information were judged partially correct. Figure 9 shows the distribution of different correctness values for each topic. 
Number of responses Figure 9. Result correctness by topic The characteristics of user interaction with the system, and of user effort, were measured by: the numbe r of iterations (i.e. queries) in a search; the total number of docum ents or paragraphs saved at the end of the search; the numbe r of documents or books viewed during a search; and, the mean query length per search. Table 4 displays these results. Table 4. Interaction and effort measures (* significant at &lt;.05 level, ** significant at &lt;.01 level) The number of iterations per search is significantly lower in the integrated system (ANOVA, F= 4.516, p=0.035), and the query length is significantly higher in that system (ANOVA, F=34.571, p&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences in the other two variables. 
Systems Time 
Integrated 9.11(2.91) 5.40 ** The usability of the systems was measured in two general ways: one had to do with subjects X  percep tions of ease of learning to use the system, ease of use of th e system, understanding of the system, and usefulness of the system (all on 7-point scales, 1=low; 7=high). The results (Table 5) show that subjects found the integrated system to be significantly (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) easier to use (Z=-2.264, p=0.024), and significantly more useful (Z =-2.522, p=0.012) than the baseline system. The second general approach to evaluating usability measured issues concerned with searching. The variables here were perceptions of ease of starting a search, ease of doing the search, satisfaction with search results (reported in Table 3), and whether the subject had enough time to do the search (all on the same type of 7-point scale). The results (Table 6) are that it was significantly (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) easier to start the search in the integrated system (Z=-2.239, p=0.025), and that there was a significant difference in favor of the integrated system in subjects X  perception of having had enough time to do the search (Z=-2.466, p=0.014). Although difference in ease of searching is not significant (Z=-1.341, p=0.180), it is, again, in the integrated system X  X  favor. Table 5. Use usability measures (* significant at &lt;.05 level) Systems Easy to Baseline 5.25 Integrated 5.53 Table 6.

There was no measure on which the baseline system, built using current state-of-the-art technology, and using the standa rd current support techniques, outperformed the integrated system. Furthermore, in each of our evaluation categories, the integrated system significantly outperformed the baseline system, on at least two measures. With respect to our performan ce measures, although there was no significant difference between the systems with respect to time taken for completing the task, this is probably an artifact of the design, which limited search time to twelve minutes. The advantage to the integrated system for both aspectual recall and subject satisfaction with results was highly significant, and there was no difference in correctness of results between the systems. There were significant differences in favor of the integrated system on two interaction meas ures. The number of iterations, that is, queries, per search was significantly lower, and the mean query length was significantly higher. Since it is known that longer queries perform better in best match systems, the latter result is of some general interest. Both systems, in many respects, were novel to the subjects, but the integrated system was thought by them to be significantly easier to use, and significantly more useful, with respect to the tasks. It was also significantly easier for the subjects to start their tasks in the integrated system, and when asked if they had sufficient time to do the search, they gave significantly more positive responses for the integrated system. We considered whether the results could have arisen from any systematic differences between the subjects with respect to their topic expertise or familiarity. The data on these factors (Table 7) seem not to support this, as th e subjects X  mean self-reported expertise and familiarity, measured on a 7-point low to high scale, are all pretty uniformly low, for all topics, with rather low standard deviation, as well. Only 1 subject indicated topic familiarity of 7, for only one topic; 9 subjects indicated topic familiarity of 6, for four topics ; these data are insufficient to investigate any possible interaction of familiarity with system. Table 7. Topic familiarity and expertise (7-point low to high scale) Topic No. Training -book Training -article 1 Global warming 4.22 (1.29) 3.44 (1.39) 2 High blood pressure 3.31 (1.28) 2.66 (1.36) 3 International trade in 4 Auto safety 2.94 (1.32) 2.47 (1.14) 5 Development of 6 Childhood education 2.69 (1.69) 2.16 (1.32) 7 Development of the 8 History of Rome 2.16 (1.37) 1.84 (1.17) Thus, it appears that our basic hypothesis, that an integrated system which adapts to support different ISSs during the course of an information-seeking episode , better supports information seeking than a system designed to support only the standard ISS of specified searching, is itself supported. In this paper, we presented an Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) system which adapts to suppor t a searcher in a variety of different ways during the course of an information-seeking episode. This system is based on a theoretical model of IIR, which construes an information-seeki ng episode as a person X  X  moving from one Information-Seeking Strate gy (ISSs) to another. On the basis of this theoretical model and a classification of ISSs, we identified different combinations of various IR techniques which we hypothesized would best suppor t the different ISSs that a searcher might engage in while attempting to resolve some particular kinds of information pr oblems. This analysis led to the implementation of an integrated IIR system which adapts to support both scanning and searching behaviors within a single framework. To see whether an integrated system of the sort that we implemented would in fact be tter support human information seeking than the type kind of IIR system in current use, which is designed to support only one kind of ISS, specified searching comparing a query to a set of information objects, we conducted an user-oriented experiment. The experiment compared user performance and behavior in our integrated system to that in a baseline system which emulated the support offered by most standard IIR systems. The results of the experiment demonstrated substantial and significant advantage to the integrated system in terms of objective and subjective performance; degree of user interaction with the system; and usability. Th ese results, we believe, speak strongly in favor of the general concept of designing IIR systems explicitly to be able to support different ISSs. They also demonstrate that it is indeed po ssible to support quite different behaviors within a single system framework which searchers can actually understand and use effectiv ely. They also demonstrate that a principled approach to designing such systems is possible. We believe that we have shown, through this study, at least to a limited extent, that a model of IIR as support for interaction with information, combined with an empirically-based classification of such interactions, can provide such principles. Of course, there are limitations to the conclusions which we can draw from our experiment, and i ssues concerning our conclusions which need further to be investigat ed. As always in user studies of this type, we were constrained by a limited, and to some extent rather homogeneous number of s ubjects, and a limited number of search topics. The only realistic wa y to address this issue is to do more studies, which we intend to perform. Furthermore, since this was an experimental study, the subjects were assigned topics to search, ra ther than searching on topics of their own interest, and searched in somewhat limited databases. We attempted to address this problem by using scenario-based topic descriptions (cf. [5]), and by use of a TREC collection, but the only way really to deal with it is to move from a strictly experimental environment to a qua si-experimental environment in which the integrated system is embedded in a real-life context. Such a study awaits a more robust and complete system than the one that we have tested, as well as one that is not so specifically tailored to particular types of information problems. Finally, the integrated IIR system which we tested responded to only a small number of different ISSs. The identification of good support techniques for other ISSs, their implementation in a more general integrated IIR system, and the evaluation of such a system is an obvious next step. Despite the limitations and unanswe red questions associated with this study, we believe that it is a convincing step on the road toward the reality of integrated IIR systems, which will adapt to provide support for a variety of ISSs within a single information-seeking episode.

 Information-seeking strategy, interaction structure, user interface design, evaluation, information retrieval Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems ask people to specify queries using terms to select documents from the selected databases. Current research indicates some problems of such systems. (1) Human information-seeking behavior is more complicated than just query formulation and term selection. For instance, people need to get an idea of which domain or genre of information they need, then familiarize themselves with the content and structure of various databases. They need to learn about a domain of interest and extend their knowledge of this domain so that they can formulate more effective queries. They need to change their searching and seeking strategies to improve their queries. (2) Human information-seeking behaviors are not discrete processes. These behaviors interact with one another during information-seeking processes (Belkin, 1996). (3) Interaction, not representation or comparison, is the central process of IR (Belkin, 1993). (4) Users with different goals need to use different information-seeking strategies (ISSs) to conduct searches. However, traditional IR systems only support one ISS, that is, formulating queries using terms to select documents from some databases (Belkin, 1993, 1995; Xie, 2000). (5) It is known that different ISSs can be optimally supported by different combinations of IR techniques (Oddy, 1977). The existing diversity of ISSs indicates that a system which provides good support for one ISS is unlikely to provide good support for the others. A system trying to support all ISSs with only one technique will be able to support them at only mediocre levels. Therefore, the goal of the research is to design an interactive IR system which incorporates different IR techniques to adaptively support different ISSs. Specifically, our solution to these problems focuses mainly on the following two goals. (1) Constructing a single IR system in which (2) Evaluating the effectiveness and usability of We aim to investigate the following research problems: (1) Implementing and evaluating several systems which are tailored to scanning or searching. (2) Developing a structure for guiding and controlling sequences of different support techniques. (3) Constructing and evaluating a single system which supports scanning and searching through integration of different support techniques within a single system framework. 3.1 Research Problem 1 S Using the Lemur toolkit (LEMUR), we implemented and evaluated several different prototype IR systems designed to support scanning (situation 1) or searching (situation 2). Table 1 describes the tasks, as well as features and support techniques for each system. HYPOTHESES Hypothesis 1: The system summarizing each database is more effective in supporting scanning tasks than the baseline system which provides a ranked list of documents with descriptions about which databases these documents are in. (E1.1/B1.1, situation1-task1) Hypothesis 2: The system providing table of contents navigation is more effective in supporting scanning tasks than the baseline system which lists ranked paragraphs. (E1.2/B1.2, situation1-task2) Hypothesis 3: The system presenting clustered retrieval results is more effective in supporting searching tasks than the baseline system which presents a ranked list of retrieval results. (E2.1/B2.1, situation2-task1) Hypothesis 4: The system supporting fielded queries is more effective in supporting searching tasks than the baseline system which provides a generic query search. (E2.2/B2.2, situation2-task2) Table 1. Situations, Tasks and Systems EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Participants conducted four searches on four different topics that are suitable for scanning or searching. This is a within-subjects design. Each subject searched half of the topics in one system, then half of the topics in the other system. Within the topic block, the topic order was randomly assigned. No two subjects used the same order of topics and the same order of systems. The experiments were replicated by exchanging the order of the systems. TEXT COLLECTIONS There are two text collections: one is TREC HARD 2004 collection (HARD) which is suitable for situation1-task1 and situation2-task1, the other is a book database which is good for situation1-task2 and situation2-task2. This database is composed of books downloaded from Project Gutenberg (Gutenberg). TASKS In this study, we used the simulated work task situation model (Borlund, 1997) to make subjects X  behavior as true-to-life as possible, hoping this will make our results robust. Here is an example for situation1-task1. 3.2 Research Problem 2 (Future Work) In order to guide the presentation of specific support techniques during the information seeking process, we need to specify an interaction structure. This interaction structure is equivalent to a dialogue manager, and can be used to control the interactions between the system and the user. We will employ the idea of interaction structure developed in the MERIT system (Belkin, 1995). This structure models human-computer interaction as dialogues and particular dialogue structures are associated with different ISSs. This structure will be incorporated into the system at the user interface level and act as the dialogue manager. 3.3 Research Problem 3 (Future Work) S The integrated system will allow the user to use a variety of ISSs and to seamlessly switch from one ISS to another in the information-seeking process. The user will be able to choose which ISS to use at any time. ISSs will be classified according to the goal of the interaction, the topic or task, and the information-seeking stage, etc. The system should be able to suggest to the user appropriate ISSs at the appropriate times, given the current state of the information-seeking process. HYPOTHESIS Hypothesis 5: The integrated system purposely designed for supporting both scanning and searching is more effective in supporting tasks requiring scanning and searching than the generic baseline system. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN This will be a within-subject experimental design. The subjects will search the integrated system and then the baseline system. The experiment will be replicated by changing the order of the systems. Our aim is to contribute to the field of interactive information retrieval drawing attention to the user interface design and HCI. The systems in research problem 1 have been implemented and the user studies were conducted. Future work will focus on the interaction structure and construction and testing of the integrated system. Through this we hope to improve information retrieval and human-computer interaction. Belkin, N. J., Marchetti, P. G., &amp; Cool, C.
