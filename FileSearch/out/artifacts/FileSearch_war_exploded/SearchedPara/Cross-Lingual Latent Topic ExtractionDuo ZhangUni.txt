 As a robust unsupervised way to perform shallow latent semantic analysis of topics in text, prob-abilistic topic models (Hofmann, 1999a; Blei et al., 2003b) have recently attracted much atten-tion. The common idea behind these models is the following. A topic is represented by a multino-mial word distribution so that words characteriz-ing a topic generally have higher probabilities than other words. We can then hypothesize the exis-tence of multiple topics in text and define a gener-ative model based on the hypothesized topics. By fitting the model to text data, we can obtain an es-timate of all the word distributions corresponding to the latent topics as well as the topic distributions in text. Intuitively, the learned word distributions capture clusters of words that co-occur with each other probabilistically.

Although many topic models have been pro-posed and shown to be useful (see Section 2 for more detailed discussion of related work), most of them share a common deficiency: they are de-signed to work only for mono-lingual text data and would not work well for extracting cross-lingual latent topics, i.e. topics shared in text data in two different natural languages. The deficiency comes from the fact that all these models rely on co-occurrences of words forming a topical cluster, but words in different language generally do not co-occur with each other. Thus with the existing models, we can only extract topics from text in each language, but cannot extract common topics shared in multiple languages.

In this paper, we propose a novel topic model, called Probabilistic Cross-Lingual Latent Seman-tic Analysis (PCLSA) model, which can be used to mine shared latent topics from unaligned text data in different languages. PCLSA extends the Proba-bilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) model by regularizing its likelihood function with soft constraints defined based on a bilingual dictio-nary. The dictionary-based constraints are key to bridge the gap of different languages and would force the captured co-occurrences of words in each language by PCLSA to be  X  X ynchronized X  so that related words in the two languages would have similar probabilities. PCLSA can be esti-mated efficiently using the General Expectation-Maximization (GEM) algorithm. As a topic ex-traction algorithm, PCLSA would take a pair of unaligned document sets in different languages and a bilingual dictionary as input, and output a set of aligned word distributions in both languages that can characterize the shared topics in the two languages. In addition, it also outputs a topic cov-erage distribution for each language to indicate the relative coverage of different shared topics in each language.

To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has attempted to solve this topic extraction prob-lem and generate the same output. The closest existing work to ours is the MuTo model pro-posed in (Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2009) and the JointLDA model published recently in (Jagarala-mudi and Daum  X  e III, 2010). Both used a bilingual dictionary to bridge the language gap in a topic model. However, the goals of their work are dif-ferent from ours in that their models mainly focus on mining cross-lingual topics of matching word pairs and discovering the correspondence at the vocabulary level. Therefore, the topics extracted using their model cannot indicate how a common topic is covered differently in the two languages, because the words in each word pair share the same probability in a common topic. Our work fo-cuses on discovering correspondence at the topic level. In our model, since we only add a soft con-straint on word pairs in the dictionary, their prob-abilities in common topics are generally different, naturally capturing which shows the different vari-ations of a common topic in different languages.
We use a cross-lingual news data set and a re-view data set to evaluate PCLSA. We also propose a  X  X ross-collection X  likelihood measure to quanti-tatively evaluate the quality of mined topics. Ex-perimental results show that the PCLSA model can effectively extract cross-lingual latent topics from multilingual text data, and it outperforms a baseline approach using the standard PLSA on text data in each language. Many topic models have been proposed, and the two basic models are the Probabilistic Latent Se-mantic Analysis (PLSA) model (Hofmann, 1999a) and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model (Blei et al., 2003b). They and their extensions have been successfully applied to many prob-lems, including hierarchical topic extraction (Hof-mann, 1999b; Blei et al., 2003a; Li and McCal-lum, 2006), author-topic modeling (Steyvers et al., 2004), contextual topic analysis (Mei and Zhai, 2006), dynamic and correlated topic models (Blei and Lafferty, 2005; Blei and Lafferty, 2006), and opinion analysis (Mei et al., 2007; Branavan et al., 2008). Our work is an extension of PLSA by in-corporating the knowledge of a bilingual dictio-nary as soft constraints. Such an extension is sim-ilar to the extension of PLSA for incorporating so-cial network analysis (Mei et al., 2008a) but our constraint is different.

Some previous work on multilingual topic mod-els assume documents in multiple languages are aligned either at the document level, sentence level or by time stamps (Mimno et al., 2009; Zhao and Xing, 2006; Kim and Khudanpur, 2004; Ni et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2007). However, in many ap-plications, we need to mine topics from unaligned text corpus. For example, mining topics from search results in different languages can facilitate summarization of multilingual search results.
Besides all the multilingual topic modeling work discussed above, comparable corpora have also been studied extensively (e.g. (Fung, 1995; Franz et al., 1998; Masuichi et al., 2000; Sadat et al., 2003; Gliozzo and Strapparava, 2006)), but most previous work aims at acquiring word trans-lation knowledge or cross-lingual text categoriza-tion from comparable corpora. Our work differs from this line of previous work in that our goal is to discover shared latent topics from multi-lingual text data that are weakly comparable (e.g. the data does not have to be aligned by time). In general, the problem of cross-lingual topic ex-traction can be defined as to extract a set of com-mon cross-lingual latent topics covered in text col-lections in different natural languages. A cross-lingual latent topic will be represented as a multi-nomial word distribution over the words in all the languages, i.e. a multilingual word distri-bution. For example, given two collections of news articles in English and Chinese, respectively, we would like to extract common topics simul-taneously from the two collections. A discov-ered common topic, such as the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, would be characterized by a word distribution that would assign relatively high probabilities to words related to this event in both English and Chinese (e.g.  X  X error X ,  X  X ttack X ,  X  X fghanistan X ,  X  X aliban X , and their translations in Chinese).

As a computational problem, our input is a multi-lingual text corpus, and output is a set of cross-lingual latent topics. We now define this problem more formally.
Definition 1 (Multi-Lingual Corpus) A multi-lingual corpus C is a set of text collections {C is a collection of documents in language L i with vocabulary V i = { w i 1 ,w i 2 ,...,w i N the total number of documents in C i , N i is the to-tal number of words in V i , and d i j is a document in collection C i .

Following the common assumption of bag-of-words representation, we represent document d i j with a bag of words { w i j c ( w i k ,d i j ) to denote the count of word w i k in docu-ment d i j .

Definition 2 (Cross-Lingual Topic): A cross-lingual topic  X  is a semantically coherent multi-nomial distribution over all the words in the vo-cabularies of languages L 1 ,...,L s . That is, p ( w |  X  ) would give the probability of a word w which can be in any of the s languages under consideration.  X  is semantically coherent if it assigns high probabil-ities to words that are semantically related either in the same language or across different languages. Clearly, we have cross-lingual topic  X  .

Definition 3 (Cross-Lingual Topic Extrac-tion) Given a multi-lingual corpus C , the task of cross-lingual topic extraction is to model and ex-tract k major cross-lingual topics {  X  1 , X  2 ,..., X  k } from C , where  X  i is a cross-lingual topic, and k is a user specified parameter.

The extracted cross-lingual topics can be di-rectly used as a summary of the common con-tent of the multi-lingual data set. Note that once a cross-lingual topic is extracted, we can eas-ily obtain its representation in each language L i by  X  X plitting X  the cross-lingual topic into multi-ple word distributions in different languages. For-mally, the word distribution of a cross-lingual topic  X  in language L i is given by p i ( w i |  X  ) =
These aligned language-specific word distribu-tions can directly review the variations of topics in different languages. They can also be used to analyze the difference of the coverage of the same topic in different languages. Moreover, they are also useful for retrieving relevant articles or pas-sages in each language and aligning them to the same common topic, thus essentially also allow-ing us to integrate and align articles in multiple languages. In this section, we present our probabilistic cross-lingual latent semantic analysis (PCLSA) model and discuss how it can be used to extract cross-lingual topics from multi-lingual text data.
The main reason why existing topic models can X  X  be used for cross-lingual topic extraction is because they cannot cross the language barrier. Intuitively, in order to cross the language barrier and extract a common topic shared in articles in different languages, we must rely on some kind of linguistic knowledge. Our PCLSA model as-sumes the availability of bi-lingual dictionaries for at least some language pairs, which are generally available for major language pairs. Specifically, for text data in languages L 1 , ..., L s , if we rep-resent each language as a node in a graph and connect those language pairs for which we have a bilingual dictionary, the minimum requirement is that the whole graph is connected. Thus, as a min-imum, we will need s  X  1 distinct bilingual dictio-naries. This is so that we can potentially cross all the language barriers.

Our key idea is to  X  X ynchronize X  the extraction of monolingual  X  X omponent topics X  of a cross-lingual topic from individual languages by forcing a cross-lingual topic word distribution to assign similar probabilities to words that are potential translations according to a L i -L j bilingual dictio-nary. We achieve this by adding such preferences formally to the likelihood function of a probabilis-tic topic model as  X  X oft constraints X  so that when we estimate the model, we would try to not only fit the text data well (which is necessary to extract coherent component topics from each language), but also satisfy our specified preferences (which would ensure the extracted component topics in different languages are semantically related). Be-low we present how we implement this idea in more detail.

A bilingual dictionary for languages L i and L j generally would give us a many-to-many map-ping between the vocabularies of the two lan-guages. With such a mapping, we can construct a bipartite graph G ij = ( V ij ,E ij ) between the two languages where if one word can be poten-tially translated into another word, the two words would be connected with an edge. An edge can be weighted based on the probability of the cor-responding translation. An example graph for Chinese-English dictionary is shown in Figure 1.
With multiple bilingual dictionaries, we can merge the graphs to generate a multi-partite graph G = ( V,E ) . Based on this graph, the PCLSA model extends the standard PLSA by adding a constraint to the likelihood function to  X  X mooth X  the word distributions of topics in PLSA on the multi-partite graph so that we would encourage the words that are connected in the graph (i.e. pos-sible translations of each other) to be given simi-lar probabilities by every cross-lingual topic. Thus when a cross-lingual topic picks up words that co-occur in mono-lingual text, it would prefer pick-ing up word pairs whose translations in other lan-guages also co-occur with each other, giving us a coherent multilingual word distribution that char-acterizes well the content of text in different lan-guages.

Specifically, let  X  = {  X  j } ( j = 1 ,...,k ) be a set of k cross-lingual topic models to be discovered from a multilingual text data set with s languages such that p ( w |  X  i ) is the probability of word w ac-cording to the topic model  X  i .

If we are to use the regular PLSA to model our data, we would have the following log-likelihood and we usually use a maximum likelihood estima-tor to estimate parameters and discover topics. L (
C ) =
Our main extension is to add to L ( C ) a cross-lingual constraint term R ( C ) to incorporate the knowledge of bilingual dictionaries. R ( C ) is de-fined as where w ( u,v ) is the weight on the edge between u and v in the multi-partite graph G = ( V,E ) , which in our experiments is set to 1 , and Deg ( u ) is the degree of word u , i.e. the sum of the weights of all the edges ending with u .

Intuitively, R ( C ) measures the difference be-in a bilingual dictionary; the more they differ, the larger R ( C ) would be. So it can be regarded as a  X  X oss function X  to help us assess how well the  X  X omponent word distributions X  in multiple lan-guages are correlated semantically. Clearly, we would like the extracted topics to have a small R ( C ) . We choose this specific form of loss func-tion because it would make it convenient to solve the optimization problem of maximizing the cor-responding regularized maximum likelihood (Mei et al., 2008b). The normalization with Deg ( u ) and Deg ( v ) can be regarded as a way to compen-sate for the potential ambiguity of u and v in their translations.

Putting L ( C ) and R ( C ) together, we would like to maximize the following objective function which is a regularized log-likelihood: where  X   X  (0 , 1) is a parameter to balance the likelihood and the regularizer. When  X  = 0 , we recover the standard PLSA.

Specifically, we will search for a set of values for all our parameters that can maximize the ob-jective function defined above. Our parameters include all the cross-lingual topics and the cov-erage distributions of the topics in all documents, which we denote by  X  = { p ( w |  X  j ) ,p (  X  j | d ) } d,w,j where j = 1 ,...,k , w varies over the entire vo-cabularies of all the languages , d varies over all the documents in our collection. This opti-mization problem can be solved using a General-ized Expectation-Maximization (GEM) algorithm as described in (Mei et al., 2008a).

Specifically, in the E-step of the algorithm, the distribution of hidden variables is computed using Eq. 2.
Then in the M-step , we need to maximize the complete data likelihood Q ( X ;  X  n ) : where with the constraints that w p ( w
There is a closed form solution if we only want to maximize the L  X  ( C ) part: However, there is no closed form solution in the M-step for the whole objective function. Fortu-nately, according to GEM we do not need to find the local maximum of Q ( X ;  X  n ) in every M-step, and we only need to find a new value  X  n +1 to im-prove the complete data likelihood, i.e. to make sure Q ( X  n +1 ;  X  n )  X  Q ( X  n ;  X  n ) . So our method is to first maximize the L  X  ( C ) part using Eq. 4 and then use Eq. 5 to gradually increase the R ( C ) part. p
Here, parameter  X  is the length of each smooth-ing step. Obviously, after each smoothing step, the sum of the probabilities of all the words in one topic is still equal to 1. We smooth the parameters until we cannot get a better parameter set  X  n +1 . Then, we continue to the next E-step. If there is no  X  n +1 s.t. Q ( X  n +1 ;  X  n )  X  Q ( X  n ;  X  n ) , then we consider  X  n to be the local maximum point of the objective function Eq. 1. 5.1 Data Set The data set we used in our experiment is collected from news articles of Xinhua English and Chi-nese newswires. The whole data set is quite big, containing around 40,000 articles in Chinese and 35,000 articles in English. For different purpose of our experiments, we randomly selected different number of documents from the whole corpus, and we will describe the concrete statistics in each ex-periment. To process the Chinese corpus, we use a simple segmenter 1 to split the data into Chinese phrases. Both Chinese and English stopwords are removed from our data.

The dictionary file we used for our PCLSA model is from mandarintools.com 2 . For each Chi-nese phrase, if it has several English meanings, we add an edge between it and each of its English translation. If one English translation is an En-glish phrase, we add an edge between the Chinese phrase and each English word in the phrase. 5.2 Baseline Method As a baseline method, we can apply the standard PLSA (Hofmann, 1999a) directly to the multi-lingual corpus. Since PLSA takes advantage of the word co-occurrences in the document level to find semantic topics, directly using it for a multi-lingual corpus will result in finding topics mainly reflecting a single language (because words in dif-ferent languages would not co-occur in the same document in general). That is, the discovered top-ics are mostly monolingual. These monolingual topics can then be aligned based on a bilingual dic-tionary to suggest a possible cross-lingual topic. 6.1 Qualitative Comparison To qualitatively compare PCLSA with the baseline method, we compare the word distributions of top-ics extracted by them. The data set we used in this experiment is selected from the Xinhua News data during the period from Jun. 8th, 2001 to Jun. 15th, 2001. There are totally 1799 English articles and 1485 Chinese articles in the data set. The num-ber of topics to be extracted is set to 10 for both methods.

Table 1 shows the experimental results. To make it easier to understand, we add an English translation to each Chinese phrase in our results. The first ten rows show sample topics of the mod-eling results of traditional PLSA model. We can see that it only contains mono-language topics, i.e. the topics are either in Chinese or in En-glish. The next ten rows are the results from our PCLSA model. Compared with the base-line method, PCLSA can not only find coherent topics from the cross-lingual corpus, but it can also show the content about one topic from both two language corpora. For example, in  X  X opic 2 X  Table 2: Synthetic Data Set from Xinhua News which is about  X  X srael X  and  X  X alestinian X , the Chi-nese corpus mentions a lot about  X  X rafat X  who is the leader of  X  X alestinian X , while the English cor-pus discusses more on topics such as  X  X ease fire X  and  X  X omen X . Similarly, in  X  X opic 9 X , the topic is related to Philippine, the Chinese corpus men-tions some environmental situation in Philippine, while the English corpus mentions a lot about  X  X bu Sayyaf X . 6.2 Discovering Common Topics To demonstrate the ability of PCLSA for finding common topics in cross-lingual corpus, we use some event names, e.g.  X  X hrine X  and  X  X lympic X , as queries and randomly select a certain number of documents from the whole corpus, which are re-lated to the queries. The number of documents for each query in the synthetic data set is shown in Ta-ble 2. In either the English corpus or the Chinese corpus, we select a smaller number of documents about topic  X  X hampionship X  combined with the other two topics in the same corpus. In this way, when we want to extract two topics from either En-glish or Chinese corpus, the  X  X hampionship X  topic may not be easy to extract, because the other two topics have more documents in the corpus. How-ever, when we use PCLSA to extract four topics from the two corpora together, we expect that the topic  X  X hampionship X  will be found, because now the sum of English and Chinese documents related to  X  X hampionship X  is larger than other topics. The experimental result is shown in Table 3. The first two columns are the two topics extracted from En-gish corpus, the third and the forth columns are two topics from Chinese corpus, and the other four columns are the results from cross-lingual cor-pus. We can see that in either the Chinese sub-collection or the English sub-collection, the topic  X  X hampionship X  is not extracted as a significant topic. But, as expected, the topic  X  X hampionship X  is extracted from the cross-lingual corpus, while the topic  X  X lympic X  and topic  X  X hrine X  are merged together. This demonstrate that PCLSA is capable of extracting common topics from a cross-lingual corpus. 6.3 Quantitative Evaluation We also quantitatively evaluate how well our PCLSA model can discover common topics among corpus in different languages. We pro-pose a  X  X ross-collection X  likelihood measure for this purpose. The basic idea is: suppose we got k cross-lingual topics from the whole corpus, then for each topic, we split the topic into two sepa-rate set of topics, English topics and Chinese top-ics, using the splitting formula described before, word distribution of the Chinese topics (translating the words into English) to fit the English Corpus and use the word distribution of the English top-ics (translating the words into Chinese) to fit the Chinese Corpus. If the topics mined are common topics in the whole corpus, then such a  X  X ross-collection X  likelihood should be larger than those topics which are not commonly shared by the En-glish and the Chinese corpus. To calculate the likelihood of fitness, we use the folding-in method proposed in (Hofmann, 2001). To translate topics from one language to another, e.g. Chinese to En-glish, we look up the bilingual dictionary and do word-to-word translation. If one Chinese word has several English translations, we simply distribute its probability mass equally to each English trans-lation.

For comparison, we use the standard PLSA model as the baseline. Basically, suppose PLSA mined k semantic topics in the Chinese corpus and k semantic topics in the English corpus. Then, we also use the  X  X ross-collection X  likelihood measure to see how well those k semantic Chinese topics fit the English corpus and those k semantic English topics fit the Chinese corpus.

We totally collect three data sets to compare the performance. For the first data set, (English 1, Chinese 1), both the Chinese and English corpus are chosen from the Xinhua News Data during the period from 2001.06.08 to 2001.06.15, which has 1799 English articles and 1485 Chinese ar-ticles. For the second data set, (English 2, Chi-nese 2), the Chinese corpus Chinese 2 is the same as Chinese 1, but the English corpus is chosen from 2001.06.14 to 2001.06.19 which has 1547 documents. For the third data set, (English 3, Chi-nese 3), the Chinese corpus is the same as in data set one, but the English corpus is chosen from 2001.10.02 to 2001.10.07 which contains 1530 documents. In other words, in the first data set, the English corpus and Chinese corpus are com-parable with each other, because they cover simi-lar events during the same period. In the second data set, the English and Chinese corpora share some common topics during the overlap period. The third data is the most tough one since the two corpora are from different periods. The purpose of using these three different data sets for evaluation is to test how well PCLSA can mine common top-ics from either a data set where the English corpus and the Chinese corpus are comparable or a data set where the English corpus and the Chinese cor-pus rarely share common topics.
 The experimental results are shown in Table 4. Each row shows the  X  X ross-collection X  likelihood of using the  X  X ross-collection X  topics to fit the data set named in the first column. For example, in the first row, the values are the  X  X ross-collection X  likelihood of using Chinese topics found by differ-ent methods from the first data set to fit English 1. The last collum shows how much improvement we got from PCLSA compared with PLSA. From the results, we can see that in all the data sets, our PCLSA has higher  X  X ross-collection X  likelihood value, which means it can find better common top-ics compared to the baseline method. Notice that the Chinese corpora are the same in all three data sets. The results show that both PCLSA and PLSA get lower  X  X ross-collection X  likelihood for fitting the Chinese corpora when the data set becomes  X  X ougher X , i.e. less topic overlapping, but the im-Table 4: Quantitative Evaluation of Common Topic Finding ( X  X ross-collection X  log-likelihood) provement of PCLSA over PLSA does not drop much. On the other hand, the improvement of PCLSA over PLSA on the three English corpora does not show any correlation with the difficulty of the data set. 6.4 Extracting from Multi-Language Corpus In the previous experiments, we have shown the capability and effectiveness of the PCLSA model in latent topic extraction from two language cor-pora. In fact, the proposed model is general and capable of extracting latent topics from multi-language corpus. For example, if we have dic-tionaries among multiple languages, we can con-struct a multi-partite graph based on the corre-spondence between those vocabularies, and then smooth the PCLSA model with this graph.

To show the effectiveness of PCLSA in min-ing multiple language corpus, we first construct a simulated data set based on 1115 reviews of three brands of laptops, namely IBM (303), Apple(468) and DELL(344). To simulate a three language cor-pus, we use an  X  X BM X  word, an  X  X pple X  word, and a  X  X ell X  word to replace an English word in their corpus. For example, we use  X  X BM10 X ,  X  X pple10 X ,  X  X ell10 X  to replace the word  X  X D X  whenever it ap-pears in an IBM X  X , Apple X  X , or Dell X  X  review. Af-ter the replacement, the reviews about IBM, Ap-ple, and Dell will not share vocabularies with each other. On the other hand, for any three created words which represent the same English word, we add three edges among them, and therefore we get a simulated dictionary graph for our PCLSA model.

The experimental result is shown in Table 5, in which we try to extract 8 topics from the cross-lingual corpus. The first ten rows show the re-sult of our PCLSA model, in which we set a very small value to the weight parameter  X  for the reg-ularizer part. This can be used as an approxima-tion of the result from the traditional PLSA model on this three language corpus. We can see that the extracted topics are mainly written in mono-language. As we set the value of parameter  X  larger, the extracted topics become multi-lingual, which is shown in the next ten rows. From this result, we can see the difference between the re-views of different brands about the similar topic. In addition, if we set the  X  even larger, we will get topics that are mostly made of the same words from the three different brands, which means the extracted topics are very smooth on the dictionary graph now. In this paper, we study the problem of cross-lingual latent topic extraction where the task is to extract a set of common latent topics from multi-lingual text data. We propose a novel probabilistic topic model (i.e. the Probabilistic Cross-Lingual Latent Semantic Analysis (PCLSA) model) that can incorporate translation knowledge in bilingual dictionaries as a regularizer to constrain the pa-rameter estimation so that the learned topic models would be synchronized in multiple languages. We evaluated the model using several data sets. The experimental results show that PCLSA is effec-tive in extracting common latent topics from mul-tilingual text data, and it outperforms the baseline method which uses the standard PLSA to fit each monolingual text data set.

Our work opens up some interesting future re-search directions to further explore. First, in this paper, we have only experimented with uni-form weighting of edge in the bilingual graph. It should be very interesting to explore how to assign weights to the edges and study whether weighted graphs can further improve performance. Second, it would also be interesting to further extend PCLSA to accommodate discovering top-ics in each language that aren X  X  well-aligned with other languages.
