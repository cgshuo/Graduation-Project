Actor importance recognition in networks has been studied at length in the social network litera-and group processes was initiated in [2,3], whereas characterization of the communications in small influences in group processes.

One of the most important metrics in social network analysis is the centrality measure. Researchers have introduced a wide variety of centrality measures to determine the importance of the nodes in a Various metrics have been proposed to measure the centrality of a graph X  X  node. These metrics vary based on the node X  X  notion of importance that they seek to capture and the notion is encoded through defined on the nearness of the actor to its neighbors. The most famous metrics in this group include degree-based [4], closeness-based [5], and graph-based [6], centrality measures. The second group of metrics is based on the idea that central nodes standing between others on the path of communication have more importance compared to the other nodes. Some graph centrality measures belonging to this group are betweenness [4,7], stress [8] and connection graph stability [9,10].

The betweenness centrality measure has a large number of applications in fields such as geography as clustering and detection of hidden communities in a social network [22], and skill acquisition in reinforcement learning [23,24].

Because of the high dimensionality of the popular social networks and computational burden of pro-been used to compute centrality measures with less computaional complexity [27,28]. betweenness cenntrality score computation for a given node takes only a few number of SSSPs for a predefined error bound. The strong relationship between the approximate error bound and the number of our randomized sampling based algorithm is assessed using several real world networks and a syn-thetic computer generated ones. The results show that the new approach has less computational burden comparing others and it efficiently approximates the betweenness centrality measure.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the definition of betweenness centrality measures. Section 3 describes the proposed randomized algorithm. Section 4 assesses the quality of the approximation of betweenness centrality of the proposed method based on the benchmark networks. Section 5 concludes this paper.
 2. Betweenness centrality measure Many networks such as social, biological and knowledge networks can be represented using a graph G =( V,E ) ,wheretheset V of nodes denotes the actors and the set E  X  V  X  V of edges denotes relationships between the actors. Let n and m be the number of nodes and edges respectively. Without paths that connects each two distinct nodes in the graph [25], i.e., is the number of shortest paths between node s and node t .

Brandes [25] proposed a method to compute centrality scores of all the graph nodes in the same asymptotic time bounds as the computation of n SSSP X  X . The dependency of a source node s  X  V on a  X  centrality score for undirected and directed graphs respectively. More details are given in [25]. 3. Randomized approximate betweenness algorithm
We will illustrate a fast randomized approximate algorithm to estimate the betweenness centrality method are derived using several techniques, the original idea of computational geometry [30], using dimensional setting [33] and the best known error bound using moment generating function [34]. The centrality measure using the same approach of [34].

The proposed algorithm randomly chooses k sample nodes and computes dependency  X  S  X  ( V ) for each to the randomly selected nodes. To approximate the betweenness centrality of the node v , number of graph G and the dependency of the node v i to the node v ,  X  v  X  centrality estimate of the node v is calculated as BC ( v )= n k ( n  X  1) k i =1  X  v  X  proposed algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1.

Nevertheless, the main problem here is how to choose the number of randomly selected nodes k .To the specified node v . Let the random variable X i represent the dependency of randomly sampled node v to the node v ,e.g.
 computed by, First, we state some facts about the random variable X i without proof.
 Lemma 1. Let X i denote the dependency of the node v i to the node v .Then Lemma 2. The mean of X i is BC ( v ) ,i.e. E ( X i )= BC ( v ) .
 estimate is unbiased.
 Lemma 3. Let BC ( v ) be the approximate betweenness centrality of the node v , which is calculated using Algorithm 1. Then
The way we choose the number of samples, k , to approximate the betweenness centrality measure is as and identically distributed) random variables X i ,i =1 ,...,k ,where 0 X i M and  X  0 , following main result.
 Theorem 2. Let X 1 ,X 2 ,...,X k be normally distributed with mean  X  and standard deviation  X  , N (  X ,  X  2 ) , then it follows, Proof. Using Bool X  X  inequality [37], we can write, The right hand side of Eq. (8) equals the following, where 0 t&lt; 1 2 . By the monotone property of the exponential function, we rewrite Eq. (9) as, N (0 , 1) , the following is known, Therefore, using results Eqs (10) and (11), and applying Markov inequality [37], Eq. (8) equals, In Eq. (12), the minimum value of t should be determined. By differentiating the right hand side of Eq. (12), the optimum value of t would be, Substituting this value Eq. (13), in Eq. (12), we will have, measure, which is done in the following theorem.
 node v  X  V using k selected nodes at random. Let k be a positive integer such that Then for each 0 &lt; X &lt; 1 , and integer n , the following is true for an arbitrary node v  X  V , relation Eq. (4) it can be easily seen that  X  2 = var ( X i ) n ( n  X  2) n  X  1 Using the above relations, we can write the right hand side of Eq. (7) as, Also if  X  =  X  ( n  X  2) in Eq. (16), one can rewrite Eq. (7) as, write Eq. (17) as, follows that, k , i.e. log( k )  X  ( k  X  1)  X  1 2 ( k  X  1) 2 ,as, Solving the inequality (21) to get the result Eq. (14).
 Our bound is sharper than the previous method as Fig. 1 shows the plot of two error bounds, Brandes, method approaches zero more rapidly as k increases.

Also, Fig. 2 shows that the number of required nodes to be taken randomly from the network is highly decreased using the proposed method compared to the Brandes method.
 4. Performance and evaluation
The quality of the proposed algorith m is evaluated on several real-world networks. In addition, to compute the exact centrality scores for later comparison, the tests are limited to the networks with relatively small size (order of 1,000 vertices and 10,000 edges). A summary of the network datasets is given in Table 1. Since the execution time and speedup achieved by the approximation approach are paper. 4.1. Network data

Random graph  X  random  X  is an unweighted and undirected random network of 976 nodes and 2396 edges, gen-erated with the Erdos X  X enyi graph model [38] using pajek software [39]. The seven real networks are and media ownership network  X  eva  X  [45] obtained from [41]. In the following a brief description of these networks is given.

Evaluation methods as the root of mean square error, RMSE, mean of absolute error, MAE, and mean of absolute percentage error, MAPE. In this work, we have used RMSE because of the desirable theoretical background, more common usage in the literature and good performances on some initial experiments. One can refer [48] is described.

First exact centrality scores of all the networks in Table 1 are computed, then the proposed approx-imation algorithm is run to obtain approximate centrality scores. The RMSE criterion for accuracy of betweenness centrality approximation is defined as, graph.

The proposed method is applied to estimate the betweenness centrality scores of all the nodes in the are given for only 100 randomly selected nodes in Fig. 3.

The results show that the approximated values of the betweenness centrality of the nodes are very networks are observed.
 nodes have been selected for each network. The approximate and exact scores for these top high score networks.

In most applications, we are interested in high score nodes, because they are the strategic members of the network and could be used for further interpretation; for instance, when mining the network, centrality scores and then the top high score nodes are selected.
 exact ranks. Therefore the node ranks are computed using approximate and exact algorithms and then the mean square rank error is computed for each test instance using RE evaluation measure, Eq. (23). nodes is smaller than the other nodes. According to these results one can claim that the approximate algorithm can be used to identify high score nodes with an acceptable accuracy. 5. Discussion and conclusion than the previous method. The proposed method has shown better efficiency according to the proba-tion measures. An extensive experimental study on real-world graph instances is also conducted which proved that the approximation algorithm is performing satisfactory. The approach is backed by strong wherever a betweenness centrality measure is required to be stamped as the main feature. Acknowledgements
