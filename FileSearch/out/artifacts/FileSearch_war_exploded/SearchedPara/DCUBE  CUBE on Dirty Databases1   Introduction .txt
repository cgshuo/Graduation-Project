 Because of the inconsistency of pattern matching in data integration, the inconsis-there may be inconsistent data, error data, duplicated data in databases. We define the wrong decisions. Currently, the major method of dirty data management is data clean-database. Therefore, in many cases, it is necessary to perform queries directly on dirty databases. The problem rises how to get the query results with clean degrees on dirty databases. It brings new challenges to the research of database systems. Effective and efficient OLAP on dirty data is one of them. 
OLAP analysis is an important method of using databases to help users making de-cisions. There are large amount of dirty data in reality, and they are hard to be elimi-nated completely. Therefore, it has widely applications to process OLAP analysis on dirty data. 
Currently, some techniques about query processing on dirty data have been proposed. queries on dirty data. [7, 8, 9] adopt the method of returning a clean degree which repre-sents the probability of the existing of a result to deal with the queries on dirty data. [10] have never considered about the OLAP analysis on dirty data. [12] proposes a OLAP data model to present data ambiguity, but its model mainly focuses on data imprecision, and does not consider the errors resulted in by data integrity constraint. CUBE is an important operator of OLAP analysis [11]. Taking advantage of CUBE, the results of aggregation can be maintained off-line, thereby the OLAP analysis can be accelerated. It is natural to use CUBE to speed up the OLAP analysis determinate, so the value can be simply recorded without ambiguity. But on dirty corresponding clean degrees should be recorded besides the value. This storage fea-ture also makes the CUBE algorithm without considering about ambiguity not effec-tive on dirty data. 
To meet these challenges, this paper presents DCUBE, a CUBE operator on dirty processing, tuples possibly referring to the same entity form a cluster. DCUBE is defined on such clusters. Different from the traditional CUBE, in results of DCUBE, each value is output with a clean degree, which presents the probability that the value is the correct result. 
The main contributions of this paper are: 1. In order to support the OLAP analysis on dirty data, the operator DCUBE is 2. The algorithm of performing aggregation queries on dirty data efficiently with 3. DCUBE is applied to compute several kinds of OLAP operators. With 4. We test the efficiency of the algorithms proposed in this paper. The experi-M attributes S  X  { D i |1  X  i  X  n} , DCUBE on MDS can be represented as DCUBE(MDS, S, defined as following iterative process.  X  sub  X  S, D={ D In a DCUBE(MDS, S, f), every entity contains a set of elements, which are pairs (cid, prob) for COUNT or triples (cid, vals, prob) for SUM and MAX. cid is the id that the element is the correct one. A multidimensional array of storing these enti-ties is called an EMA, in which an entity is stored in an item, which has a buffer of size H in the main memory. An EMA is called an aggEMA if it is used to store aggregation results. 
If dvals are values of dimensional attributes, mvals are values of metric attrib-utes, the algorithm of distributing data into an EMA is shown in algorithm 1. The algorithm of MAX is shown in algorithm 3. The algorithms of COUNT and SUM are omitted for lack of space. equaling to a specific value in an EMA; dice is to obtain all the entities with values of specific dimension in a specific range in an EMA; roll-up and drill-down is to find the corresponding results; and Pivot is to rearrange the placement of dimensions. We take the table customer in TPCH[13] as dirty data but neglect the attribute C_CUSTKEY. q1, q2, q3 are 3 queries and the number of dimensional attributes of q1 is bigger than that of q2 and q3. Running time is taken as measure. 
Fig. 1 is the result of the scalability of the DCUBE for COUNT. It is observed with the increasing of inputting data, the running time of q1 is longer than that of q2, and the running time of q2 is longer than that of q3. This shows with the increasing of the number of dimensional attributes, the running time of the algorithms increases. 
The result of proceeding MAX is shown in Fig. 2. We can see that the more di-mensions a MDS has, the more aggEMAs need to be generated during processing aggregation on DCUBE, the more time it takes. CUBE is an important operator for OLAP. Effective CUBE on dirty data is one of the key problems to accelerate aggregation queries and to process OLAP analysis on dirty data. Based on overlapping clustering, this paper defines DCUBE, the CUBE on dirty data, and discusses the methods of storing and computing DCUBE on dirty data. With DCUBE, the methods of accelerating aggregation queries on dirty data and the implementation methods of other OLAP operations are proposed in this paper, which can return a sequence of OLAP analysis results with clean degrees X  guarantee. The efficiency of the algorithms proposed in this paper is tested by both theoretical analy-sis and experimental results. 
Our future work includes speeding up the methods proposed in this paper and studying the iceberg CUBE on dirty data.
