 When we type text using a keyboard, we generate many spelling errors, both typographical (caused by the keyboard layout and hand/finger movement) and cognitive (caused by phonetic or orthographic sim-ilarity) (Kukich, 1992). When the errors are caught during typing, they are corrected on the fly, but un-noticed errors will persist in the final text. Previ-ous research on spelling correction has focused on the latter type (which we call uncorrected errors ), presumably because the errors that are corrected on the spot (referred to here as corrected errors ) are not recoded in the form of a text. However, study-ing corrected errors is important for at least three reasons. First, such data encapsulates the spelling mistake and correction by the author, in contrast to the case of uncorrected errors in which the in-tended correction is typically assigned by a third person (an annotator), or by an automatic method (Whitelaw et al., 2009; Aramaki et al., 2010) 1 . Sec-ondly, data on corrected errors will enable us to build a spelling correction application that targets correc-tion on the fly, which directly reduces the number of keystrokes in typing. This is crucial for languages that use transliteration-based text input methods, such as Chinese and Japanese, where a spelling error in the input Roman keystroke sequence will prevent the correct candidate words from appearing in the list of candidates in their native scripts, thereby pre-venting them from being entered altogether. Finally, we can collect a large amount of spelling errors and their corrections by logging keystrokes and extract-ing the pre-and post-correction strings from them. By learning the characteristics of corrected and un-corrected errors, we can expect to use the data for improving the correction of the errors that persisted in the final text as well.

In this paper, we collect naturally occurring spelling error data that are corrected by the users online from keystroke logs, through the crowd-sourcing infrastructure of Amazon X  X  Mechanical Turk (MTurk). As detailed in Section 3, we dis-play images to the worker of MTurk, and collect the descriptions of these images, while logging their keystrokes including the usage of backspace keys, via a crowd-based text input service. We collected logs for two typologically different languages, En-glish and Japanese. An example of a log along with the extracted pre-and post-correction strings is shown in Figure 1. We then performed two com-parative analyses: corrected vs. uncorrected errors in English (Section 4.3), and English vs. Japanese corrected errors (Section 4.4). Finally, we remark on an additional cause of spelling errors observed in all the data we analyzed (Section 4.5). Studies on spelling error generation mechanisms are found in earlier work such as Cooper (1983). In particular, Grudin (1983) offers a detailed study of the errors generated in the transcription typing sce-nario, where the subjects are asked to transcribe a text without correcting the errors they make. In a more recent work, Aramaki et al. (2010) automati-cally extracted error-correction candidate pairs from Twitter data based on the assumption that these pairs fall within a small edit distance, and that the errors are not in the dictionary and substantially less fre-quent than the correctly spelled counterpart. They then studied the effect of five factors that cause er-rors by building a classifier that uses the features as-sociated with these classes and running ablation ex-periments. They claim that finger movements cause the spelling errors to be generated, but the uncor-rected errors are characterized by visual factors such as the visual similarity of confused letters. Their ex-periments however target only the persisted errors, and their claim is not based on the comparison of generated and persisted errors.

Outside of English, Zheng et al. (2011) analyzed the keystroke log of a commercial text input system for Simplified Chinese, and compared the error pat-terns in Chinese with those in English. Their use of the keystroke log is different from ours in that they did not directly log the input in pinyin (Romanized Chinese by which native characters are input), but the input pinyin sequences are recovered from the Chinese words in the native script (hanzi) after the character conversion has already applied. Amazon X  X  Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is a web ser-vice that enables crowdsourcing of tasks that are dif-ficult for computers to solve, and has become an im-portant infrastructure for gathering data and annota-tion for NLP research in recent years (Snow et al. 2008). To the extent of our knowledge, our work is the first to use this infrastructure to gather user keystroke data. 3.1 Task design In order to collect naturally occurring keystrokes, we have designed two types of tasks, both of which consist of writing something about images. In one task type, we asked the workers to write a short description of images (image description task); in the other, the workers were presented with im-ages of a person or an animal, and were asked to guess and type what she/he was saying (let-them-talk task). Using images as triggers for typing keeps the underlying motivation of keystroke collection hidden from the workers, simultaneously allowing language-independent data collection. For the im-age triggers, we used photos from the Flickr X  X  Your Best Shot 2009/2010 groups . Examples of the tasks and collected text are given in Figure 2. 3.2 Task interface For logging the keystrokes including the use of backspaces, we designed an original interface for the text boxes in the MTurk task. In order to simplify the interpretation of the log, we disabled the cursor movements and text highlighting via a mouse or the arrow keys in the text box; the workers are therefore forced to use the backspace key to make corrections. In Japanese, many commercially available text in-put methods (IMEs) have an auto-complete feature which prevents us from collecting all keystrokes for inputting a word. We therefore used an in-house IME that has disabled this feature to collect logs. This IME is hosted as a web service, and keystroke logs are also collected through the service. For En-glish, we used the service for log collection only. 4.1 Data We used both keystroke-derived and previously available error data for our analysis.
 Keystroke-derived error pairs for English and Japanese ( en keystroke , ja keystroke ): from the raw keystroke logs collected using the method de-scribed in Section 3, we extracted only those words that included a use of the backspace key. We then recovered the strings before and after correction by the following steps (Cf. Figure 1):  X  To recover the post-correction string, we  X  To recover the pre-correction string, we com-
We then lower-cased the pairs and extracted only those within the edit distance of 2. The resulting data which we used for our analysis consists of 44,104 pairs in English and 4,808 pairs in Japanese 2 . Common English errors ( en common ): follow-ing previous work (Zheng et al., 2011), we ob-tained word pairs from Wikipedia 3 and SpellGood 4 . We lower-cased the entries from these sources, re-moved the duplicates and the pairs that included non-Roman alphabet characters, and extracted only those pairs within the edit distance of 2. This left us with 10,608 pairs. 4.2 Factors that affect errors Spelling errors have traditionally been classified into four descriptive types: Deletion, Insertion, Substitu-tion and Transposition (Damerau, 1964). For each of these types, we investigated the potential causes of error generation and correction, following previ-ous work (Aramaki et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2011). Physical factors: (1) motor control of hands and fin-gers; (2) distance between the keys; Visual factors: (3) visual similarity of characters; (4) position in a word; (5) same character repetition; Phonologi-cal factors: (6) phonological similarity of charac-ters/words.

In what follows, our discussion is based on the frequency ratio of particular error types, where the frequency ratio refers to the number of cases in spelling errors divided by the total number of cases in all data. For example, the frequency ratio of con-sonant deletion is calculated by dividing the number of missing consonants in errors by the total number of consonants. 4.3 Corrected vs. uncorrected errors in English In this subsection, we compare corrected and uncor-rected errors of English, trying to uncover what fac-tors facilitate the error correction.
 Error types (Figure 3) Errors in en keystroke are dominated by Substitution, while Deletion errors are the most common in en common , indicating that Substitution mistakes are easy to catch, while Dele-tion mistakes tend to escape our attention. Zheng et al. (2011) reports that their pinyin correction er-rors are dominated by Deletion, which suggests that their log does in fact reflect the characteristics of cor-rected errors.
 Position of error within a word (Figure 5) In en keystroke , Deletion errors at the word-initial po-sition are the most common, while Insertion and Substitution errors tend to occur both at the be-ginning and the end of a word. In contrast, in en common , all error types are more prone to oc-cur word-medially. This means that errors at word edges are corrected more often than the word-internal errors, which can be attributed to cognitive effect known as the bathtub effect (Aitchison, 1994), which states that we memorize words at the periph-ery most effectively in English.
 Effect of character repetition (Figure 6) Dele-tion errors where characters are repeated, as in tomorow  X  tomorrow , is observed significantly more frequently than in a non-repeating context in en common , but no such difference is observed in en keystroke , showing that visually conspicuous er-rors tend to be corrected.
 Visual similarity in Substitution errors (Figure 4) We computed the visual similarity of characters by areaofcharacterA + areaofcharacterB ) follow-ing Aramaki et al. (2010) 5 . Figure 4 shows that in en common , Substitution errors of visually similar characters (e.g., yoqa  X  yoga ) are in fact very common, while in en keystroke , no such tendency is observed.
 Phonological similarity in Substitution errors (Figure 8) In en keystroke , there is no notable difference in consonant-to-consonant (C  X  C) and vowel-to-vowel (V  X  V) errors, but in en common , V  X  V errors are overwhelmingly more com-mon, suggesting that C  X  C can easily be no-ticed (e.g., eazy  X  easy ) while V  X  V errors (e.g., visable  X  visible ) are not. This tendency is consistent with the previous work on the cognitive distinction between consonants and vowels in En-glish: consonants carry more lexical information than vowels (Nespor et al., 2003), a claim also supported by distributional evidence (Tanaka-Ishii, 2008). It may also be attributed to the fact that En-glish vowel quality is not always reflected by the on-thography in the straightforward maner.

Summarizing, we have observed both visual and phonological factors affect the correction of errors. Aramaki et al. (2010) X  X  experiments did not show that C/V distinction affect the errors, while our data shows that it does in the correction of errors. 4.4 Errors in English vs. Japanese From Figure 3, we can see that the general error pattern is very similar between en keystroke and ja keystroke . Looking into the details, we discov-ered some characteristic errors in Japanese, which are phonologically and orthographically motivated. Syllable-based transposition errors (Figure 7) When comparing the transposition errors by their distance, 1 being a transposition of adjacent char-acters and 2 a transposition skipping a character, the instances in en keystroke are mostly of distance of 1, while in ja keystroke , the distance of 2 also occurs commonly (e.g., kotoro  X  tokoro ). This is inter-esting, because the Japanese writing system called kana is a syllabary system, and our data suggests that users may be typing a kana character (typically CV) as a unit. Furthermore, 73% of these errors share the vowel of the transposed syllables, which may be serving as a strong condition for this type of error. Errors in consonants/vowels (Figure 8) Errors in ja keystroke are characterized by a smaller ra-tio of insertion errors of vowels relative to conso-nants, and by a relatively smaller ratio of V  X  V sub-stitution errors. Both point to the relative robust-ness of inputting vowels as opposed to consonants in Japanese. Unlike English, Japanese only has five vowels whose pronunciations are transparently car-ried by the orthography; they are therefore expected to be less prone to cognitive errors. 4.5 Look-ahead and look-behind errors In Substitution errors for all data we analyzed, sub-stituting for the character that appeared before, or are to appear in the word was common (Figure 9). In particular, in en keystroke and ja keystroke , look-ahead errors are much more common than non-look-ahead errors. Grudin (1983) reports cases of permutation (e.g., gib  X  big ) but our data in-cludes non-permutation look-ahead errors such as puclic  X  public and otigaga  X  otibaga . We have presented our collection methodology and analysis of error correction logs across error types (corrected vs. uncorrected) and languages (English and Japanese). Our next step is to utilize the col-lected data and analysis results to build online and offline spelling correction models.
