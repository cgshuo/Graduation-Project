 1. Introduction obtained for construction of the lower and upper approximations. based on substitution of the indiscernibility relation by a dominance relation. which the objects are characterized by imprecise evaluations.
 because they are constructed on the basis of different views of the unknown values. values should be taken into account in the IIIS, they are: interval-valued data with unknown upper limit and known lower limit, interval-valued data with unknown lower limit and known upper limit, interval-valued data with both unknown lower and unknown upper limits. are also discussed. We then conclude the paper with a summary and outlook for further research. 2. Preliminaries 2.1. Dominance relation in incomplete information system An information system is a pair I  X h U ; AT i , where U is a non-empty finite set of objects, it is called the universe;
AT is a non-empty finite set of attributes. 8 a 2 AT ; V a is used to represent the domain of attribute a and then V  X  V Moreover, for each x 2 U , let us denote by a  X  x  X  the value that x holds on a  X  a 2 AT  X  .
Making (MCDM) problems, which is called the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA). let to A # AT ,if x a y for each a 2 A . value of object x is unknown on attribute a .

We assume here that the unknown value is just  X  X  X issed X , but it does exist. Thus, the unknown value  X  X  to be comparable with any value in the domain of the corresponding attribute, i.e.  X  X  value . Thus, one can construct the following extension of dominance relation. 2.2. Dominance relation in interval-valued information system respectively.

Incomplete interval-valued information system with single-valued data, three types of unknown values should be considered in an IIIS. (1) Unknown interval-valued data with known lower limit and unknown upper limit . (2) Unknown interval-valued data with unknown lower limit and known upper limit. (3) Unknown interval-valued data with both unknown lower and unknown upper limits . and unknown upper limit, we can make the following assumption. the set of objects dominate x possibly, i.e.  X  x P A  X f y 2 U :  X  y ; x  X 2 D  X  A  X g ; the set of objects dominated by x possibly, i.e.  X  x 6 A  X f y 2 U :  X  x ; y  X 2 D  X  A  X g . incompleteness of the illustrative example in Ref.
