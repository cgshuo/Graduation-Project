Definition1. Equivalent value set. the complexity of the e-commerce platform, for V, V, ij VV where 1  X  is the value threshold. Definition2. Equivalent attribute set. where 2  X  is the attribute threshold. 
The identity of semantics of identity between the attributes is defined as 3.3 Recognition of Commodity Entity can be rewritten as: where D i is the i th item of W j .B, D i .T is the type of D of W j .B, D i .V is the value of i th item of W W .B, D i .w is the weight of i th item of W j .B while D i For a given commodity Wa, identify the possible candidate commodity set.  X   X  .  X  X  X   X  = where two commodities X  titles. 
For spectively K K K { , ,..., , , ,..., } = X = . (6) the same order Kb. 
The Tanimoto title similarity of the Wa and Wb is: 
Sim (Wa, Wb)  X   X  , then Wa and Wb is the same title. threshold of commodities. 
In the same way, the price distance of two commodities is: 
Sim (Wa, Wb)  X   X  , then Wa and Wb is the same price. threshold of commodities. 
Finally, the credibility of two commodity Wa and Wb is : Sim(W.B,Wi.B)= 3.4 Sorting of the Commodity Entity Algorithm. Entity identification of commodities input X  commodity Wa output X the same entity commodity set of Wa Map: input X key= key=Wa X value= value=Wa.B process X  1. map (key,value) 2. for each item in value 3. &lt;A a1 ,V a1 &gt;,W a  X  Extraction ( item ) 4. collect(&lt;A a1 ,V a1 &gt;,W a ) Reduce: input X key=&lt;W key=&lt;W a &gt; X value=&lt;A value=&lt;A a1 process X  5. reduce (key,value) 6.

The details of our data sets are summarized in Table 1. 4.1 Performance Metrics sion, recall, F1-measure, RT and IS. 1  X  Accuracy modity sets SW = {W 1 , W 2 ,...W n }, RW k = {W same commodity entities of the kth commodity. According to the k the algorithm is: 
The average recall of the algorithm is: 
The average of F1-measure of the algorithm is: 2  X  Efficiency ta) and IS(Increment Speed ). the linear approximation of RT. 4.2 Analysis of Experimental Results stronger advantage than the traditional way. efficiency is superior to traditional methods. thus to improve the recall rate, but the sharp decline in accuracy. be the next focus in our future work.
