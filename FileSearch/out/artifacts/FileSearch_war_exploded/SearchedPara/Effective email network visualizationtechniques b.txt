In this paper, we propose measurement of interaction behaviors in information exchange networks (e.g., emails, messaging, and blog networks) which involve actors sending information to one another. The interaction behaviors often suggest actor roles in information exchange networks and the behaviors to be modeled include engagingness and responsiveness . In our study, the engagingness behavior is the responsiveness behavior as the ability of responding to an incoming message. For example, take a look at two actors in an email network. A actor u i sent three emails to three actors and only two u responsive than u j in the email network.
Identifying these engaging and responsive actors is a useful task in viral marketing, targeted adver-tisement, online surveys, etc. For instance, if a private company advertises a new brand product (e.g., Samsung Galaxy Tab II) to hundreds thousands customers, the marketing cost is extremely expensive. However, if it advertises to a few opinion leaders, the actors may spontaneously advertise to the other actors in email networks. Such opinion leaders can be detected using both engagingness and responsive-engagingness (or responsiveness) scores over time to see if there is the correlation between events and the change of his behaviors. For example, suppose that we can measure the quantitative behavior scores he is a big maniac about soccer games, his behavior scores are likely to be high during world cup game seasons.

Technically, we have mainly focused on modeling engagingnessand responsivenessbehaviors in email networks. We have used Enron email data set as the target data set. This data set are so far the only known publicly available information exchange data with messages assigned with specific senders and recipients. We conduct data preprocessing on the email data and establish links between emails and their replies. Then, we propose several engagingness and responsiveness models. 1 More specifically, we networks. They are (1) email based (2) email thread based and (3) email sequence based categories. For quantitative be havior models for measuring each user X  X  engagingness and responsiveness scores in the network. Next, we compare and analyze the proposed behavior models. In our empirical study, we found engagingness and responsiveness are distinct from each other. Most engagingness (or responsiveness) models of actors are shown to be consistent with one another.

Based on our proposed behavior models, we can detect high engaging or responsive actors systemat-mation exchange networks. For example, let us suppose that security agents keep tracking of actors in terrorist networks. They can easily discover engaging or responsive actors with the highest behavior scores, but may miss further useful information  X  e.g., To whom actors tend to communicate with, how amount of data actors send, and so on. To cope with these challenges, we present a graph visualization technique for visualizing a given information exchange network based on engagingness and responsive-ness behaviors. In this work, we propose how to visualize actors and their relationships in information exchange networks. In particular, since actors mainly communicate with their friends, colleagues or acquaintances via emails, it is important to see the behaviors of actors in parts of the email network rather than those of all actors in the entire network. Therefore we detect community structures from the Enron email network and then take a look at engaging or responsive actors in each community. For this matter, we show graph visualization methods including behaviors and community structures in the information exchange networks based on our engagingness and responsiveness models.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce our data preprocessing step on the email data and creation of links between emails and their replies. Next, we present our engagingness and responsiveness behavior models in Section 3. In Section 4, we compare and analyze our behavior models and further discuss our graph visualization techniques. We also describe related work in Section 5 followed by Section 6 including the limitation of our work in this paper. Finally, we offer our concluding remarks and future work in Section 7. 2. Preprocessing step
Throughout this research, we used the Enron email data set in our empirical study of real data. This data set is so far the only known publicly available email data with messages assigned with specific senders and recipients [6]. This data set provides 517,431 emails for 151 Enron employees. Each email message has a unique message ID and contains header information such as the date and time when the message was sent, sender, recipients (To and Cc lists), subject and body in plain text format. We performed two data preprocessing steps on the email data, namely duplicate elimination and email rela-tionship identification .

Duplicate elimination. As noticed by previous studies on this corpus, there are many duplicate emails as such emails also have unique message IDs. We therefore use a strategy similar to [7] by computing the MD5 sum on email fields: Date/Time, Sender, To, Cc, Subject and Body. This will assign the same MD5 value (128 bit integer) to all duplicate emails that exactly match on these fields. After duplicate elimination, the data set contains 257,044 unique emails.

Email relationship identification. To identify reply and forward relationships between emails, we first group all emails of each matching subject after ignoring the Reply and Forward prefixes (e.g., RE, FW, FWD, etc.) and order them by time. Each reply (or forward) email e i in the group is then assigned a email e .

The detailed algorithm for identifying reply and forward relationships among emails is as follows:  X  Step 1: Group all emails with matching subjects after ignoring the prefixing Reply (RE, Re) and  X  Step 2: Sort emails in each subject group by date and time. We use the Perl module Time::Local  X  Step 4: Compute the time difference t ( e 1 )  X  t ( e 2 ) . link. In our experiments, we set  X  = 90 days (3 months) and discard pairs that have a time difference larger than that.

With this approach, we found 34,008 email relationships of which 27,730 and 6,278 are reply and forward relationships respectively. When a set of emails form a connected component by reply and forward relationships, we call it an email thread. From the email relationships identified, we derive 18,593 threads that connect 52,601 emails (about 20% of all unique emails). To evaluate our email among links detected by our method. For this, we selected a random sample of 100 link relationships other is the correct reply email. Our manual evaluation showed a precision of 91%. To compute recall, we randomly selected 30 subject groups, each of which contains about 5 or 10 emails. For each subject group, we manually created threads by connecting emails to their follow-up responses. This sample includes about 120 emails with 79 reply links and 21 forward links. For each link of two emails, we manually examined if the link is correctly found by our method. We found 79% correct links which are In our subsequent experiments, we therefore use these identified email relationships. 3. Engagingness and responsiveness behavior models In this section, we describe our proposed behavior models for user engagingness and responsiveness. All the models assume that emails have been preprocessed as described in Section 2. We divide our models into the following categories:  X  Email based models : These models consider emails as the basic data units for measuring user be- X  Email thread based models : These models consider email threads as the basic data units for mea- X  Email sequence based models : These models examine the sequence of emails received and replied
Table 2 shows a list of symbols and their meanings that we use in this paper. 3.1. Email based models
In this section, we show four email based models, each of which captures different hypothesis based on the number of emails, the number of recipients per email, reply time, or email size. 3.1.1. Email count model (EC)
The email count model simply counts the number of emails related to user engagingness and respon-siveness behaviors and turns them into quantities that measure engagingness and responsiveness. This siveness score by the proportion of received emails replied.
 the engagingness E EC and responsiveness R EC scores of a user u i : 3.1.2. Email recipient model (ER) list tend to reply to a sender. Furthermore, we exploit the following hypothesis.
 received email. (q.e.d) The engagingness E ER and responsiveness R ER scores of a user u i are defined as follows: 3.1.3. Email reply time model (ET) The email reply time is an indicator of measuring a user X  X  engagingness and responsiveness scores. This model is based on the following hypothesis: siveness of a recipient is high if he quickly replies to the received email. (q.e.d)
Givenanemail e and a reply email e ,the reply time ,  X  ( e ) ,isdefinedby e .time  X  e.time .Thez-normalized reply time  X   X  ( e ) is defined by  X  ( e )  X   X   X  than less engaging ones, and high responsive users are expected to reply to emails quicker than low responsive ones. Hence, we define the engagingness E ET and responsiveness R ET scores of a user u i as 3.1.4. Email size model (ES)
The email size model is analogous to the email reply time model in Section 3.1.3 except that we take the content size of emails into account rather than the reply time of emails.
 Hypothesis 4. The size of reply email roughly represents the amount of a recipient X  X  effort. Suppose  X  ( e )= k .If  X  ( e ) &gt;k , the engagingness score of a sender is high. (q.e.d)
The amount of content in a reply email can be used to measure the amount of eagerness of the user responsiveness measures based on the email size as 3.1.5. Examples To illustrate the behavior models in Section 3.1, suppose a simple email network as shown in Fig. 1. engagingness score of a user u i is calculated as E EC = 3 5 =0 . 6 and E ER = u u email count model is our macro approach, while the email recipient model is our micro approach. For the email reply time model, E ET =  X  x 1 =1  X  f (  X  ( e 1  X  x 2 =1  X  f (  X  ( e 2  X  x 3 =1  X  f (  X  ( e 2 To compute function f (  X   X  ) , we transform  X  to z -scores. For instance, the z -score of  X  ( e 1 Since most z scores can be negative, more reply times are very small. In such a case, the mean of most reply times is expected to be larger, compared to the median. Therefore, we remove extreme re- X  in E E addition, the email size model computes engagingness scores in the same manner except that the email length is considered instead of the email reply time. 3.2. Email thread based model (TC)
In the email count model, engagingness scores are measured by counting the number of emails sent by u a tree of emails that are connected by reply or forward relationships. While Reply and Forward emails can be identified based on their subject (begins with a Re: or Fwd: tag), the data does not provide any explicit information on Threads or links that connect a given email with its follow-up responses. Email identify reply and forward relationships among emails. We have developed an email threading algorithm (see Section 2) and our evaluation showed that our algorithm achieved about 91% precision and 79% recall. Table 3 shows the distribution of threads by the number of emails per thread. As we can notice, 182 threads that include 10 or more emails. The largest thread contains 37 emails. Based on such email threads, this model identifies forwarded emails within an email thread which are finally received by a sender. The hypothesis of this model is as follows: Hypothesis 5. The engagingness of a sender is high if he receives most emails replied or forwarded by recipients. The responsiveness of a recipient is high if he replies or forwards most emails received by senders. (q.e.d)
The email thread based model measures user engagingness and responsiveness by considering not gagingness and responsiveness measures are defined as 3.3. Email sequence based model (RG) The order of emails that the recipient replies implies how important the emails are, and indirectly how engaging a sender (sending the recipient the emails) is. (q.e.d)
Based on the above hypothesis, we propose the email sequence based model. Given a user u i ,we denoted by  X ( u i ,e ) and  X  ( u i ,e ) respectively, as the reply email of e 1 . For each email  X  X  e 1 ,e 5 ,e 2 } , we calculate E RG = in the same manner. We omit another example due to the space constraint in this paper. 4. Empirical study 4.1. Set-up 4.1.1. Data set
For our task, we used the Enron email data set that is publicly available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/  X  enron. This data set provides 517,431 emails for 151 Enron employees. Each email message contains a unique message_ID, header information such as the date and time when the message was sent/received, sender, recipients (To and Cc lists), subject and body in plain text format.

Using the email thread assembly algorithm (please see Section 2), we created a link database that which include 27,730 Reply links and 6,278 Forward links. These binary links make up a total of 18,593 threads that connect 52,601 emails. 4.1.2. Data characteristics
We have conducted some analysis on the preprocessed email data set to derive some statistics of Enron employees using replying/forwarding emails. The interesting findings obtained include: 1. 52.6 K emails are involved in some threads. 2. Large majority ( &gt; 90%) of 18.5 K threads are short with 2 email messages each. 3. Large majority of threads last for 1 day. 4. Large majority of emails are replied within a day. 5. User response time is correlated with number of emails received, number of users he emails to, and 4.1.3. Analysis and comparison of proposed models
The first set of experiments is to evaluate and compare the six behavior models on the Enron data set. To compare two models, we utilize the Kendall  X  distance measure which is designed to compare two ranked lists. Each ranked list in our case is an ordering of actors based on their engagingness (or u 5]. 4.1.4. Graph visualization To visualize the Enron email network, we used NodeXL in [8]. NodeXL is the free and open add-in for Excel that supports network overview, discovery and exploration. As a layout algorithm, we used  X  X arel-Koren Fast Multiscale X  and discovered community structures using Clauset-Newman-Moore Clustering Algorithm. 4.2. Results 4.2.1. Analysis of behavior models
We first show the correlation between engagingness and responsiveness in our proposed models. Ta-ble 4 illustrates the Kendall  X  distance between two lists, where the Enron employees in one list are ordered by engagingness scores and the same employees in the other list are ordered by responsiveness our proposed models show that most  X  distances range in between 0.4 and 0.5. These results indicate that high engaging employees are not necessarily high responsive employees in the Enron email data.
In addition, we have studied the correlation between different behavior models. Tables 5 and 6 show the correlations of pairs of models by engagingness and responsiveness, respectively. For instance, we calculate the Kendall  X  distance between two lists, where the employees in one list are ordered by E EC and the same employees in the other list are ordered by E ER . For example, the Kendall  X  distance between E EC and E ER is 0.14 in Table 5. Interestingly, our proposed models are correlated by respon-siveness rather than by engagingness. In addition, the email thread based model shows similar pattern fewer number of forward emails among 151 Enron employees. For instance, from our email thread as-sembly, we obtained 7,291 email threads, each of which has more than or equal to 3 emails. In addition, we observed that an email sent by a sender is forwarded by recipients, and the sender finally receives reply emails by not recipients but some email users. The total number of such emails is 313 among 151 Enron employees. For E TC , only one thread contains 8 forward emails, but most threads include at most 1 or 2 forward emails. Such small number of forward emails make the email thread based model similar to the email count model.
 Furthermore, Fig. 3 depicts Top-5 Enron employees using engagingness and responsiveness. In EC, TC, ER, ET, and ES, the engagingness scores of  X  X ims X  are higher than those of  X  X app X . However, emails tend to be replied by the Last-In-First-Out principle. While some users may reply emails in the model can be affected by the recency bias principle in email networks. Similarly, in Fig. 3(b),  X  X ann X  Note that we derived the overall engagingness (or responsiveness) scores of each user by averaging the engagingness (or responsiveness) scores of different models. Then, we ranked the users by the overall scores. The overall responsiveness score of  X  X ann X  is higher than that of  X  X enhart X . On the other hand, each individual score of  X  X enhart X  is higher than that of  X  X ann X  in each model. We also selected top-10 users using engagingness and responsiveness. Subsequently, we found out three users appearing in both top-10 lists. Those are  X  X ims X ,  X  X arks X , and  X  X ymes X . Although the three users are both engaging and responsive users, engagingness scores are not closely correlated to responsiveness scores according to our experimental results. 4.2.2. Visualization Top-k engaging (or responsive) users can be selected using our engaging (or responsive) models. However, the list of only top-k engaging (or responsive) users is not the source of useful information when we attempt to understand the properties of a given information exchange network such as Enron Email Network based on our proposed models. As a better approach, we will focus on visualizing the Enron email network in order to gain the insight of the network. In this section, we have first handled how to visualize the network using either engagingness or responsiveness.

To visualize the network of Enron employees, we have taken the weight of each user which cor-responds to the user X  X  engagingness score. Since engagingness scores of many users are too low, we normalized all of the engagingness scores. We first derive the overall engagingness (or responsiveness) scores of each user by averaging the engagingness (or responsiveness) scores of different behavior mod-z viation of all engagingness scores. Next, we map z -scores to values in between 0 and 1 by means of For instance, in Fig. 4,  X  X rawner X  and  X  X iron X  are high engaging users, while  X  X ohn X  and  X  X ckay X  are low, respectively. Since the link between  X  X onohoe X  and  X  X halley X  is very thick,  X  X onohoe X  sent many emails to  X  X halley X . Most of the time,  X  X halley X  replied to  X  X onohoe X . On the other hand, since the link between  X  X kin X  and  X  X asovich X  is thin, they exchanged each other with a few emails.
Interestingly, we observed that  X  X ims X  is one of high engaging users but there is only the link be-tween  X  X erlingiere X  and  X  X ims X . This implies that  X  X ims X  sent a few emails to  X  X erlingiere X  and he received most of emails replied by  X  X erlingiere X . On the other hand,  X  X erlingiere X  has many neighbors in the email network, but his engagingness score is medium. This is, many recipients were unlikely to reply to him immediately. From these observations, we conclude that in information exchange net-cients, PageRank, and so on. Furthermore, we discovered seven community structures using the Clauset-Newman-Moore Clustering Algorithm. In general, because emails are mainly exchanged among friends, connections but there are sparse connections across communities. Users often tend to communicate with each other frequently with the community, while they are unlikely to exchange across communities. In Fig. 4, the different color of nodes stands for different community.  X  X cCarty X  in a community (in green) never communicate with  X  X ichey X  (in red). Instead,  X  X cCarty X  exchanged emails with  X  X arris X  and  X  X ayslett X  that belong to the same community (in green). Thus, we can see high engaging or respon-sive users in each community. This can improve the readability for understanding information exchange networks. For example, in a community (in dark green),  X  X ymes X ,  X  X ang X ,  X  X uzman X , and  X  X alisbury X  are high engaging users, while  X  X ain X  and  X  X olberg X  are low engaging users. Likewise, Fig. 5 shows the visualization for Enron employees using responsiveness scores. As already discussed in Section 4.2.1, high engaging employees are not closely correlated to high responsive ones in the Enron email network.
In this section, to describe underlying information of networks, we propose how to effectively visual-ize information exchange networks. In terms of our method for graph visualization, we will understand the fundamental properties of information exchange networks better than the list of top-k engaging or our behavior models can be applied as an example. 5. Related work
We first review related work on engagingness and responsiveness behavior modeling. Engagingness and responsiveness behaviors have not been well studied in the past. There is one work on responsive-of user from the other users. Users with positive deviations are known to be lethargic and those with negative deviations are responsive.

Since we are using the Enron data set, we also review other research on the data set comparing their works with ours. These works can be divided into:  X  Knowledge extraction: Rowe et al. present an automatic method for extracting social hierarchy  X  Email thread detection: To exploit parent-child relationships from email messages, grouping mes- X  Email label prediction: Karagiannis and Vojnovic study various parameters including the email
To visualize the Enron email network, Purandare [12] presented Emailviz in 2010. The Emailviz is a visualization interface for examining the Enron data set and viewing the network of email users based the email threads. The visualization interface was implemented using touchgraph package. However, Emailviz is simple graph visualization without considering user behaviors in each community that we have proposed in this paper. 6. Limitation
In this paper, we focus mainly on the problem of designing behavioral models based on communi-cation interactions shown in an email network. In addition, we will be able to develop new behavior example, we note that the email content is a useful source for measuring behaviors in our problem. We will leave this issue as our future work. 7. Concluding remarks and future work
In a nutshell, we have studied user engagingness and responsiveness behaviors in information ex-change networks. In this work, we have developed six behavior models based on different characteri-zation principles. Using the Enron data set, we evaluated these behavior models. We also applied our sualize actors and their relationships based on engagingness and responsiveness behaviors. We had also detected community structures from the email network and then visualized high engaging or responsive underlying characteristics of information exchange networks including the Enron email network. new behavior models based on probabilities and email contents. We also plan to conduct a more compre-hensive study of engagingness and responsiveness behaviors on a much larger and complete information exchange data set (e.g., twitters, blogs, short messaging, etc.). This will remove some shortcomings of the existing Enron data set which does not have complete emails of each user. We will also expand our work to apply behaviors to other interesting email prediction tasks.
