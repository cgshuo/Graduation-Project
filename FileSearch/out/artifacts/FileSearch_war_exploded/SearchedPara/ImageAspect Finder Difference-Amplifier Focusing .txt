 Recently, image search/browse systems on the Web, such as Google Image search, become very popular. However, they seem to be not useful enough. Traditional image retrieval systems focus on identifying answer images based on specific properties of image content, such as annotated keyword, colors, textures, or objects. Because there is a limit to representing characteristics of images though image data has a diversity of characteristics.
 represent which characteristics they pay attention to by one query image, since a query image has a diversity of characteristics. Moreover, in the case of browsing images retrieved by image search engine, users cannot understand why answer images are retrieved, since it cannot show relations between users X  query and answer images.

 based image retrieval methods. A conventional content-based image retrieval system retrieves answer images that are the most similar to query image se-lected among several images browsed by a user. However, the user must be not satisfied with selected answer image because he/she continues image retrieval. Thus, the retrieval system should extract real user X  X  requirements from a diver-sity of characteristics of query image. The DA for relevance feedback regards unselected browsed images with selected query image as peripheral information, so that it can extract user X  X  requirements for image retrieval by amplifying dif-ference between a query image and its peripheral image.
 anchor that refers to a target image. Then, it can extract context of the image and other images that are used in the same context. By considering not only metadata of the image but also usage context of the image as its peripheral information, the ImageAspect Finder can retrieve context for the given images and image for the given context. Therefore, the ImageAspect Finder can help users to understand a diversity of characteristics of the images. Namely, in addition to the content properties, image content is also characterized by the context in which it is exposed. For example, if we browse a flower image in sightseeing brochure, we may understand the image as a symbol of beautiful nature. Relevance-feedback with DA is different from conventional relevance-feedback in that it also uses unselected images browsed with the selected image to generate the next query.  X  X elative Query X  X 1] is also an image retrieval method using both user-selected image and unselected peripheral images to generate query. However, it does not amplify difference between selected one and unselected ones to emphasize user X  X  retrieval intention.
 clustered images as similar images are placed at neighbor each other, and it retrieves the answer image based on user-selected image as positive sample and unselected peripheral images that are placed around selected one and similar to it. By using the selected image and its peripheral ones, system can extract user X  X  rough requirement and some elements of feature vector that the user is interested in.
 itive image and a set of feature vectors of unselected peripheral images. N S p corresponds to a number of elements of peripheral ( S p ). ( S p  X  S ) means differ-ence of feature vector between a positive image and one of peripheral images. Q k and Q k + 1 correspond to the present query and the next query. The  X  ,  X  and  X  correspond to weights. Particularly, dependence on present query can be changed by  X  .
 a user selects an image as positive sample for image retrieval, which is leafier than its peripheral images. As the figure indicates, in the case of conventional relevance-feedback, user X  X  requirement is not reflected enough in answer images because conventional relevance-feedback uses only a user-selected image that he/she is not satisfied sufficiently. On the other hand, in the case of relevance-feedback with DA, user X  X  requirement, which is that he/she wants to a leafier image than its periphery, is reflected in answer images. Consequently, our sys-tem enable users to retrieve an answer image more effectively than conventional method. Images on the Web are particularly incorporated into Web pages, and recognized as a part of the page contents. For example, when we view the image showing car traffic in the Web page entitled by  X  X ir pollution gives you heart disease X , we understand that the image is used in the context of environment pollution. As a result, we may recognize the image as a picture implying air pollution caused by traffic fumes. In this way, surrounding contents of an image indicate the context in which the image is exposed, and provides an viewpoint on the image. Analyzing contexts of images facilitates understanding their roles, reputations or intended usages.
 search and browse images solely by image content. In contrast, we propose an approach for discovering typical contexts of images from the Web, which we call aspects of the images[2]. Fig. 2 illustrates basic concepts of our approach. ImageAspect Finder consists of two processes: context extraction and context clustering. For a given image, the context extraction process extracts a coherent semantic range of Web contents surrounding the image. We extend the notion of  X  X urroundings X  to incorporate the Web contents associated by Web document structure and link structure. By expanding the surrounding contents from a link anchor to its upper paragraphs, the context extraction mechanism detects a sig-nificant change of surrounding contents. The context clustering process clusters similar contexts. Each cluster represents an aspect. The clustering process ex-tracts common keywords from the contexts in each cluster as a description of the corresponding aspect. Finally, ImageAspect Finder displays the keywords and/or images typically appear in the aspect in order to  X  X isually X  acquire the surrounding contents for the given images.
 We propose and develop Difference-Amplifier and ImageAspect finder that are image search and browsing system focusing on peripheral information of query/ answer images.
