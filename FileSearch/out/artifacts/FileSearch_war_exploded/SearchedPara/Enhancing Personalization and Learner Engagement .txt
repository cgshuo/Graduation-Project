 Providing a personalized learning experience that caters for individual learner X  X  needs within the learner X  X  context of use is crucial in achieving effective learning in a technology enhanced learning (TEL) environment. Ho wever, achieving personalization amidst diverse and rich environm ent within which learning takes place still remains a major challenge. Though adaption has been proposed to provide learners with learning experiences that are tailored to their particular educa tional needs, however, one of its limitation is user involvement. Ab solute machine control is not always desirable considering the intellectual presence of human-beings. Furthermore learner engagement is one of crucial elements for realizing effective learning. Therefore, this study aims at exploring how context-awareness can support a personalized and engaged learning experience. The study in particular proposes the use of context-aware recommendation mechanism and the consideration of learner X  X  preference to learning as approaches for achieving personalization and learner engagement.

Learning always occurs in context [7]. It is impossible as [7] further notes, to separate the learner, the material to be learned and the context in which learning occurs. In addition, learner needs differ fro m learner to learner due to individual differences. As a resu lt, context in which learning occurs may vary from learner to learner due these individual differences. Therefore, it is the authors X  belief that providing learning experience that caters for individual learner X  X  needs within the learner X  X  context of us e is crucial in achieving effective learning in a TEL environment. However, with learning taking place in extremely diverse and rich environments especially with technologies in TEL, how to offer personalized learning experience that caters for individual learner X  X  needs from a potentially overwhelming variety of choices can be a daunting task. The notion of adaption has widely been proposed as an approach that can provide learners with learning experiences that are tailored to their particular educational needs and personal characteristics [4]. Though this notion aims at enhancing the end-user experience by enabling entities in the user X  X  environment to intelligently adapt to the active situation without any end-user involvement [6], however, on the other hand, absolute machine control as manifested by the mainstream pervasive computing is not always desirable. This is not only because of the fact that software intelligence remains insufficient to enumerate and address all eventualities as [6] argues, but most importantly because of the intellectual presence of human-beings. The conceptual body of literature suggest s that user engagement is one of crucial elements for realizing successful systems. For this purpose, learner situation awar eness, self-expressiveness and involvement hold a crucial role in TEL systems. TEL should not only generate good learning outcome s, but also better engage learners in the learning process. From engaged learning intellectually, and emotionally involved in their learning tasks [5]. Therefore there is need for an efficient approach to employ technology without compromising learner intelligence but ensuring learner engagement. In this study, we argue that, a) giving the learner freedom to choose rather than automatic decision making for the learner and b) the focus being on the learner as the core entity may contribute greatly in providing a personalized and engaged learning e xperience. In order to achieve this, the authors propose among ot her approaches, the use of context-aware recommendation approach and the consideration of learner X  X  preference to learning. The preference of each user is different according to user context and profile. Therefore reflecting on learning preferences is an important key for reaching diverse individual learner needs and providing personalized services. Preference not only allow the learners to choose what accommodates their multiple needs depending on places and spaces across time or their present learning situation, but also better engage them in the learning process. Apart from facilitating the identification and retrieval of suitable resources from a potentially overw helming variety of choices, recommender systems in TEL offer a promising approach that gives the user (learner) the power to decide based on their preference. This does not only enhance learner involvement in the learning process but offer a platform for personalized learning. In the TEL domain, a number of recommender systems have been introduced. A survey of recommender systems in TEL by [2] indicates that most of these sy stems suggest learning resources. Other systems that have been introduced include course recommenders and systems that s uggest people who can help with a learning activity. However, according to the authors X  knowledge, so far, recommendation of learning activities is an area that has not yet been explored. Hence the focus of this study. Another aspect worth noting are the particularities of TEL for recommendation. This area as [8] points out, offers some specific characteristics that are not met by today X  X  general purpose recommendation approaches. For example, the information retrieval goals that TEL recommenders try to achieve are often different to the ones identified in other systems [2]. Others include usage data availability, heterogeneity in learner needs [8] and pedagogical issues [2] among others. Therefore, in order to make recommendation tailored to i ndividual learner needs, hence personalize the learning experience, there is need as [8] notes, to take the context of the learner into account in a much more specific way than applied in today X  X  recommendation approaches. Relevant contextual information does matter and as [1] notes, it is important to take this inform ation into account when providing recommendations. This study attemp ts to employ context-aware recommendation approach towa rds achieving personalization within a sound pedagogical framework. The main contributions of the study will be: So far, (a) and (b) have been cove red to some extent in the study. (An overview of the contribution is presented in Fig 1. Refer to [3] for detailed explanation). Fig. 1 illustrates how learning preference can be integrated into the [3] formulated pedagogical framework at the contextual level under the learner context. The framework provides possibility to consider a wide variety of context. The context-aware adaptation &amp; personalization layer acts as the mediator between the context and learning activities. At the moment the authors are in the process of implementing the context-aware recommender system within the proposed framework. A draft overview of the system architecture is presented in Fig.2. The context-aware adaptive and personalization engine of the sy stem comprises of two major components namely; (a) Activity recommender component that recommends a learning activity based on the learner X  X  contextual information and (b) a grouping component for collaborative activities. The grouping component should be able to recommend collaborative partners based on learner X  X  preference as context. One of the advantages of using the formulated framework is that it can allow one to focus on either one aspect of contextual information (like learner X  X  sociological preference etc) or several contextual information and dimens ions (e.g device, connectivity, location, preference e.t.c) all toge ther. This attribute makes this framework to be an ideal framework within which a TEL context-aware recommendation system can be implemented. Furthermore this attribute enables the authors to carefully implement one contextual aspect at a time. At the moment, the authors X  are focusing on sociological preference (Fig.1). This will enable the incorporation of collaborative activ ities as well as apply peer to peer teaching/learning approach. An approach that is employed in the study to enhance learner e ngagement. Another advantage of the framework is that it can be easily integrated in an existing learning management system (LMS). The system to be developed in this study is intended to be integrated in Canvas Instructure LMS for testing. An approach that makes this study unique from other studies in this area. In the recommendation process, one of the approach the study has adapted for offering recommendation is contextual preference elicitation and estimation approach. Implicit methods are used to capture contextual information from computing and physical context categories while the learner contextual information especially preferences is inferred by analyzing the learner X  X  interactions with the system. The system is intended to be tested for  X  X earning Germany (for beginners) X  as the subject domain to enable the authors to fully utilize the environmental awareness (environmental context). In brief, this is how the system is intended to work: Based on the contextual information of the learner for example location, social preference e.t.c, appropriately designed learning activity (s) is/are recommended to the learner; based on the learner X  X  choice, appropriate collaborative partners are recommended for the collaborative activity; then predicting learning pattern in relation to previous learner behavior and contextual information, appropriate learning activities and collaborative partners are further recommended. Context in which learning occurs vary from learner to leaner due to individual differences. Therefore, providing learning experiences that are tailored to learner X  X  individual needs within the learner X  X  context of use, as well as involving learners in the learning process may contribute greatly in achieving effective learning in a TEL environment. Therefore this study aims at how context-awareness can explored to support a personalized and engaged learning experience amidst diverse and rich environment within which learning takes place. The study proposes the use of recommendation approaches for achieving personalization and learner engagement.
