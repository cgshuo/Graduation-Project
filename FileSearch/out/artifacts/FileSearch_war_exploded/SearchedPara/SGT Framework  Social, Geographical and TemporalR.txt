 While location-based social networks (LBSNs) have become widely used for sharing and consuming location information, a large number of users turn to general web search engines for recre-ational activity ideas. In these cases, users typically express a query combining desired activity type, constraints and suitability, around an explicit location and time  X  for example,  X  X arks for kids in NYC in winter X , or  X  X heap bars for bachelor party in san francisco X . In this work we characterize such queries as recreational queries, and propose a relevance framework for ranking points of interest (POIs) to present in the web search recreational vertical using signals from query logs and LBSNs. The first part of this framework is a taxon-omy of recreational intents, which we derive from those previously seen in query logs and other behavioral data. Based on the most popular recreational intents, we proceed to outline a new relevance model combining social, geographical and temporal information. We implement a prototype and conduct a preliminary user-study evaluation. Results show the proposed relevance model and bun-dles greatly improve user satisfaction for recreational queries.
LBSNs provide a platform for sharing and consuming local in-formation during our every day lives through location check-ins and tips. When considered collectively, this user-generated infor-mation is very useful for understanding user mobility and prefer-ence at unprecedented scale.

Location is an essential part of web search, where a major per-centage of queries have an explicit or implicit location intent [7, 8]. In this work, we focus on a specific segment of queries that have a recreational intent with a geographic preference. As an example, say that a family is planning an upcoming weekend city trip, and so are seeking suitable activity ideas. A query such as  X  things to do in london with kids  X  will trigger the recreational verti-cal to provide a short list of the most popular generic POIs such as tourist attractions and sightseeing spots. Real recreational queries are shown in Figure 1.

However, the recreational activity vertical does not contain spe-cific suggestions tailored to the user X  X  recreational intents, which Figure 1: Recreational queries for  X  things to do in san francisco...  X  in the Bing query auto-suggest feature. may comprise implicit and explicit expectations  X  such as what they want and when they want to do it (e.g., season, weekday/weekend, time of date, etc.), in addition to constraints and preferences such as being  X  outside  X ,  X  cheap  X ,  X  romantic  X , or  X  with kids  X , etc. As a result, the activity vertical POIs are often not relevant, so the user must resort to collectively reviewing the web search results for ideas. To address this issue, we aim to present to the user a number of suggestions  X  based on LBSN check-in and tip data  X  that summa-rize the activities relevant to their intent. Note that this scenario is distinguished from established venue recommendation techniques employed by LBSNs since we have no previous venue ratings pro-vided. Hence, only the user X  X  explicitly provided query and implicit context (e.g., their geo-location, or the current time) can be used to infer the user X  X  intent and expectations in the relevance model.
In this paper we present SGT, a framework that combines so-cial, geographical and temporal information for presenting results that address the user X  X  explicit (i.e., query-specified) and implicit (i.e., assumed) search intent. A central part of our framework is a taxonomy that drives the modeling and user experience.

We are interested in connecting the relevant information pro-vided by two, potentially, different crowds -the users who are look-ing for things to do in search engine, and the users who have per-formed an activity in a LBSN like Facebook or Foursquare. The goal is to use the data from LBSN to satisfy the user search query. To achieve this, we would like to understand the different types of recreational intents and queries and other user behavior, model the relevance of venues to different queries, combine them in bundles, and finally present the results to the user.

With this in mind, in this preliminary work we set out to answer the following three research questions: (1) What type of recre-ational queries are users issuing to a search engine, and what is their prevalence? (2) Can a retrieval model be built to offer rele-vant places for recreational queries, based on LBSN data? (3) Is a single linear list of relevant venues, or a set of intent-oriented bundles more effective for presenting results to users?
In answering these questions, we make the following contribu-tions: (i) a taxonomy of common recreational queries, (ii) a rel-evance model incorporating LBSN data, (iii) an approach to gen-erating result bundles for composing the results, and finally (iv) preliminary evaluation using a large-scale real-world data set.
The majority of work on LBSN data has concentrated on build-ing context-aware venue recommender systems, where the context is typically the user X  X  past preferences (expressed through check-ins) and any explicitly requested venue requirements and filtering. Because of the recent popularity of recommender systems, sev-eral evaluation tasks for optimising such systems have originated in the community. The recent TREC Contextual Suggestion (CS) Track [4] provided user rating data and user queries accompanied with context such as query submission time. While the recreational search scenario we outline in this paper has many similarities to this TREC CS task, we do not have past user preferences to consider in the POI relevance model since the majority of web search users are either anonymous, or do not frequently use an LBSN.

There has been considerable analysis of the social, geographi-cal and temporal patterns and trends present in LBSN data from many perspectives. Check-ins have been found to contain many structural patterns, caused by geographic and social constraints of user X  X  lives [3]  X  which must be incorporated into any relevance framework. Likewise, the preference for different activity types changes dramatically (e.g., going to the movie theatre on a Friday evening, versus going to the park in the morning at a weekend) [1]. Further, [5] models how check-in preferences change over different periods time  X  from hour-to-hour through to seasons of the year. In essence, in this work we integrate these findings in a retrieval model specifically for supporting recreational search in web search.
In this section, we present and discuss the SGT recreational query taxonomy as a structure of the constraints and preferences most commonly expressed in queries by users during recreational information seeking.

We study common recreational query patterns observed in a vari-ety of user-generated content and behavioral logs. In particular, we mined a month of web and mobile search query logs and browser behavioral data from the Microsoft Bing search engine. In each source we looked for queries and links which contained to the sub-string seed text  X  X hings to X ,  X  X laces to X  and  X  X hat to X , and a city recognised by a disambiguating location entity tagger. Note we find the typical nature and expectations of recreational activity varies considerably from place to place, for instance,  X  X omantic X  queries are much more popular in Paris than in Chicago. In the following sections we elaborate the top-level taxonomy aspects.
The taxonomy comprises the following high-level aspects: (i) geographical constraint, (ii) temporal constraint, (iii) activity pref-erence, (iv) activity suitability, and (v) activity constraint.
Each aspect corresponds to the recreational activity requirements expressed in real user queries. In many cases the aspects are not in-dependent, with a single query often containing many aspects (e.g.,  X  cheap things to do with kids in nyc in january  X ). In the following subsections we describe each aspect along with il-lustrative query examples from a real query log.

Geographical Constraint. Most important is the place where the user is, or alternatively, is going. Locations expressed by a user include a country, state or city. City names must be disambiguated using established techniques [6]. Relative locations such as  X  near  X  and  X  around  X  must be resolved relative to specific location. In our experiments reported in Section 6, we use major world cities as the base geographical constraint.

Temporal Constraint. Time will define relevant POIs [3, 5, 1]. For example, eating will differ during the day as people desire breakfast, lunch, dinner or late night snacks. Similarly, it is unlikely a user will visit a park on a Sunday night in a cold city.
Time periods include seasons, months, weekday/weekends, day of the week and the time of day (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening and night). Alternatively, events such as Christmas, New Year, Thanksgiving and Memorial Day, etc., can be translated into an upcoming time anchor. Relative temporal constraints can be pro-vided in the form of  X  X ow X ,  X  X oday X ,  X  X onight X  and  X  X his weekend X  etc., can also be translated into temporal constraints. In this work we do not consider current or upcoming POI trendiness in ranking.
Activity Preference. Of course, many users will have a pref-erence for the recreational activity they are seeking. They may wish to eat or drink, whether at a restaurant or in a lively outdoor area. Tourists are likely to want sightseeing areas and major POIs, in contrast to residents who may prefer cafes and parks to relax. Similarly, those looking for outdoor recreational activities will find parks and trails much more relevant.

Activity Suitability. In many cases, user X  X  seek activities with certain characteristics to match an activity purpose. For instance, couples may wish to find a location that is romantic and therefore suitable for a date or anniversary. This could be a restaurant, or something to do, such as visiting a romantic sightseeing spot.
For different age groups, users may look for locations which are suitable for kids, such as babies, toddlers, teenagers, etc. Social group suitability may include friends, family and bache-lor/bachelorette parties. Weather may also be a major factor in some locations and seasons.

Activity Constraint. Especially common are preferences for  X  X ree X ,  X  X heap X ,  X  X nique X  and  X  X ducational X  activities. For nightlife recreational queries we often saw  X  X ively X  constraints, and likewise the  X  X uiet X  constraint for bars, cafes and restaurants where the objective was likely work-related. Disabled access and dog-friendly constraints were also commonly seen.

Together, these SGT taxonomy aspects can be used to repre-sent complex recreational intents expressed in recreational queries, such as  X  unique romantic things to do this weekend in new york  X .
For each taxonomy aspect we create a classifier incorporating related terms and phrases. We use this to classify and map user query and POI tip text (from the LBSN) to the aspects which they relate in the taxonomy. The query or tip keywords present to iden-tify each aspect are intuitive, so we do not list them exhaustively here. For instance, the synonyms  X  X or kids X  or  X  X or children X  and  X  X id-friendly X  are used for the  X  X ids X  age suitability aspect.
Since tips and queries are short text, term frequency is usually 1 so a simple binary term presence classifier is effective. Future work will explore more elaborate probabilistic and natural language classifiers which can better handle positive and negative sentiments expressed in more complex phrases, such as  X  not good for kids X  X nd  X  X y kids loved this place X  in tip text.

Taxonomy Aspect Popularity in Search Queries. With a long-tail distribution typical in search, we found the ten most common recreational aspects expressed in queries were for: (1) tourism , (2) eating , (3) fun , (4) for kids , (5) weekend , (6) near , (7) free , (8) outside , (9) with dog , and (10) birthday . Notably, we found the popularity of these aspects varies hugely between cities, and for the same city at different times. Accordingly, we propose activity bundles to better support this behaviour in Section 5. Based on this taxonomy, in the next section we outline the SGT relevance model to rank POIs for recreational queries.
We extract a list of POIs for each major world city from LBSN data, and model various signals from the social data to quantify each location X  X  relevance to a recreational query. For LBSN data, we use the full 2014 check-in and POI tip datasets from the popular Foursquare and Facebook LBSNs (a combined total of over 1B+ check-ins, with a considerable number including textual tips).
Check-in times tell us when places are popular. Likewise, tips tell us what people think about POIs, offering several clues such as whether they are good for kids, a romantic date, lively, or quiet etc. All these signals must be combined to filter and rank relevant POIs for queries spanning multiple aspects of our taxonomy.

In this work we use a very large dataset of LBSN data, and as we are most interested in major world cities with plenty of check-in data available (hence, sparsity is not a problem), at this stage we employ a basic maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) model to rank POIs based on the probability that the taxonomy aspects in-ferred from check-in and tip signals match the taxonomy-classified recreational query aspects. Accordingly, for a given recreational query q rec relating to a specified city, we compute and rank the likelihood of a POI poi i being relevant using the base MLE rank-ing formula as follows: poi c is set of all POIs in the desired city (future work will explore more fine-grained locations). q t is the likelihood of the POI being relevant given any temporal activity constraints expressed in the recreational query. And finally, q a is the POI relevance to any given SGT taxonomy aspects expressed in the recreational query. We elaborate on deriving the temporal and taxonomy aspect popularity components in the following two sections.
From past check-ins, we observe the probability that a user will check-in at the POI during any given time period. We consider all permutations for parts of the day (morn-ing/afternoon/evening/night), day of the week (Monday-Sunday), weekdays/weekends and season, similar to that presented in [5]. Thus, in the base MLE ranking equation (Equation 1), we define the temporal relevance q t of poi i probabilistically as P ( poi P ( poi i | City , PartO fDay , DayO fWeek , WeekdayWeekend , Season ) .
Recent trends such as new and trending POIs will not be ob-served in past data. We leave time series modelling to capture these more elaborate temporal trends to future work.
To rank POIs for recreational queries, we must quantify the rele-vance of every POI to each aspect in the SGT taxonomy. We do this by examining the feedback in LBSN POI tips to determine which of those POIs, and POI categories, are most likely to satisfy a recre-ational query based. In essence, this means we higher rank POIs for a romantic recreational query when the POI is both in a typically romantic category (e.g., sightseeing spots, or French restaurants), and has tips mentioning that it is itself romantic.

Using the same keyword classifier detailed in Section 3.2, we classify all the POI tips into our taxonomy aspects. For ex-ample, the tip:  X  my kids loved the great food here -and it was cheap  X  would be classified with the aspects:  X  for kids  X ,  X  cheap  X  and  X  great  X . In the first instance, this allows us to observe which local POIs have a propensity towards certain taxonomy as-pects, based solely on their own tips. For example, major city parks with good play areas and open space have many tips mentioning fun, children and dogs. For the most popular POIs in major cities, this technique alone helps us quantify the relevance of the POI for the most common taxonomy aspects. However, the sparsity of tips for the majority of individual POIs and smaller cities means this approach quickly becomes ineffective.

To overcome this sparsity issue (especially for the long-tail) we rely on higher-level POI categories (e.g.,  X  bowling alley  X ,  X  play-ground  X ,  X  zoo  X ,  X  theme bar  X  and  X  beach  X , etc.) to determine the appropriateness of a POI to a given aspect via its category. This approach allows use to still present and effectively rank POIs with few or no tips relating to a given taxonomy aspect.

With this in mind, we organise aspect classified POI tips by their respective POI category  X  rather than their particular POI. From this, we compute a score that each POI category is relevant to each SGT taxonomy aspect. Henceforth, for each taxonomy aspect a and POI category c i we compute the category relevance score as: categoryrelevance ( a i , c i ) = Where freq ( a i , c i ) is the number of tips from the POI category c classified with the given aspect, and freq ( a i ) is the number of tips from any POI category classified with the given aspect. The final log term provides down-scaling for the overall most popular cat-egories (e.g., bars), which tend to appear indiscriminately in all aspects, allowing more specific  X  yet, highly relevant  X  niche cate-gories to rank highly.

The result of this scoring function provides intuitive ranking of categories for each taxonomy aspect. For example, this function ranks the POI categories  X  X ini golf X ,  X  X aintball field X ,  X  X heme park ride X ,  X  X o kart track X  and  X  X heme park X  highest for the  X  X un X  taxon-omy aspect. Likewise, it ranks  X  X layground X ,  X  X cience museum X ,  X  X oy/game store X ,  X  X heme park X  and  X  X oo X  as top for the  X  X ids X  taxonomy aspect.

To define aspect relevance for a POI to a recreational query, we combine POI-specific, if available, and POI category evidence together. Thus, we define the aspect relevance q a aspectrelevance ( poi i , q a ) = ( 1 + P ( q a | poi i )  X  ( categoryrelevance ( q i , poi category )) . P ( q a | poi that the POI poi i has a tip classified with the query aspect q preceding 1 + ... term is to smooth zero probabilities. Hence, in this model the POI-specific term can be seen as a boost for the typ-ically more much more powerful POI category score term.
Finally, we consider how to effectively present POI results to the user. When the user provides an ambiguous recreational query without any specific activity constraints, preferences or suitabil-ity (e.g., just  X  X hings to do in london X ), we posit their need is ex-ploratory  X  and so a more organised and diversified result presen-tation is required (as has been applied in web search scenarios [2]). Accordingly, we propose a simple POI result-bundling approach by activity aspect to maximise user understanding of all POI options, and thus overall satisfaction.

The prevailing approach used in the web search activity vertical is to simply present the top-k most relevant POIs in a linear list (ac-companied by thumbnail)  X  as illustrated by (1) in Figure 2. This approach is limited since it offers unintuitive organisation of POI results, and little diversity. Hence, we look to group a small num-ber of taxonomy aspect-related (e.g.,  X  X or kids X , or  X  X ightlife X  etc.) POI results into bundles to present  X  illustrated by (2) in Figure 2.
Each bundle corresponds to set of most popular aspects we have observed for the city (or, from all cities in aggregate if no such ob-Figure 2: (1) linear list-based POI result presentation, and (2) bundle-based POI result list presentation. servation is available, as is the case for smaller cities). These are the aspects we discussed in Section 3.2. Recall how we noted the aspect popularity varied from city-to-city, and indeed over time. For instance, Paris had far more recreational queries relating to ro-mantic aspects. Likewise, for Santa Cruz (CA), recreational queries mainly related to beach, outdoor and leisure aspects were most pop-ular, especially in summer.

For each city, we extracted the four most popular aspects as can-didate result bundle aspects. As per the linear list, we rank the POIs using the SGT Framework presented in the previous section. However, we interleave the results into each bundle by selecting the top-k POI results by their category and relevance to the bundle taxonomy aspect. This means for San Francisco, one such bun-dle is  X  X ith kids X   X  so we present a bundle with a combination of top ranking POIs in the  X  X layground X ,  X  X cience museum X ,  X  X oo X ,  X  X heme park X  and so forth categories.
We conducted a small user experiment to evaluate the effective-ness of the SGT framework for ranking POIs, and the presentation of POI results in linear lists versus bundles. 10 users were (5 males and 5 females, 20-40 years of age) with extensive web search ex-perience. Participants were from 6 different countries, so tested the system for a wide range of major international cities.

After a brief training session, participants were asked to interact with two systems, and answer the same set of two questions for two tasks. System 1 is the linear list-based POI results, and System 2 is bundle-based POI presentation. The tasks and questions were as follows. Task 1: Choose a city you are very familiar with , but do not live in. This might be the city in which you grew up or attended school. Task 2: What is the major city you currently live in , or near? For each system, please type the name of the city and search for things to do. Based on your experiences, please answer the following questions: ( Q1 ) Based your knowledge of the city, on a scale 1 to 5 (1=bad, 5=excellent), what is the quality of the POI suggestions? ( Q2 ) On a scale 1 to 5 (1=bad, 5=excellent), how useful is this information for a user who is not familiar with your city but is looking for things to do?
Overall, questionnaire results presented in Figures 3 and 4 show that users in general like the POI results provided by the SGT framework for their recreational queries. In particular, we find that users much prefer bundle-based result presentation, especially for familiar cities  X  this is probably because they surface more unusual options beyond the typical top well-known POIs. We also note that they feel that tourists could benefit from them, demonstrating the potential for both major recreational query use cases. We note qualitative feedback which suggested we needed to introduce inter-action to allow the user to specify the bundles they were presented. Figure 3: Average system rating for a city the user is familiar with, but does not live in (i.e., task 1).
 Figure 4: Average system rating for a city the user lives in, or near (i.e., task 2).
In this work, we investigated POI result ranking and presentation for the large number of recreational search queries posed to a web search engine. We outlined the Social, Geographical and Temporal (SGT) Framework as a first step for modelling POI relevance in this scenario. Further, recognising the issues of presenting POI results in a linear list in the activity search vertical, we proposed a POI result bundling to improve the user comprehension of results.
With respect to the research questions outlined in Section 1, we make several findings. A wide range of broand and specific recre-ational queries are posed to web search engines. We constructed a taxonomy of these, and report a long-tail frequency distribution. We outlined the SGT framework for modelling POI relevance based on the LBSN tip and check-in data. Preliminary evaluation indi-cated this first approach satisfied users. Finally, we found bundle-based result presentation is much preferred for familiar and tourist user scenarios. This work represents a first step; future work will better address city POI information sparsity, user personalisation, and bundling strategies along with more conclusive evaluation.
