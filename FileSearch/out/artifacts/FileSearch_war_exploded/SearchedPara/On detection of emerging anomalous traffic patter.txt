Constrained maximum likelihood estimation application, we assume taxi counts in a region to be varying during K time steps). Data consists of x i , i =1, ... , k . Let p i be the system reliability at the i-th stage (in our case, p

This process needs to be repeated at most ( k which stages are combined to eliminate reversals in the sequence of ratios.
To simplify, we get: , where i =1, ... , k . 3.3. Monte Carlo simulation value is among the 500 highest values of the test statistic coming from the replications. 3.4. Upper-bounding methodology region R can be upper-bounded. For instance, if a region R is composed of two non-overlapping sub-regions R then
It is equivalent to of its sub-regions and the new LRT is below the anomalous threshold (i.e. confidence level 3.5. Examples 3.5.1. Example 1 generated by Poisson model P o ( b i p ) is displayed in each cell c the region R and 0.1 for the rest of cells. The significance level is set to original steps are carried out as the following: 1. The likelihood function of each cell i is: 2. The likelihood of any given region R , which is composed of cell c 3. The MLE 0 of p for a region R (denoted as ^ p ) is calculated as: 4. The  X  of region R is given by
From the above steps, we get the exact log likelihood value of region R : log L ( p | R )= and R 2 : log L ( p | R 1 )=  X  9.49, and log L ( p | R 2 )= outlier.

It is used to detect persistent spatio-temporal outliers. The null hypothesis H over time. The alternative hypothesis H 1 assumes that KP has a higher value in region r r
This formula is the classical LRT statistic. We first calculate the MLE of maximize the denominator. Then the ratio is the score we use to evaluate the 4.2. ESTO model (Emerging Spatio-Temporal Outlier model)
This model is used to detect emerging spatio-temporal outliers. The null hypothesis H higher than r j  X  R . We calculate the likelihood ratio test as follows: algorithm can be performed to estimate the key parameter. 5. Upper-bounding strategy and pruning mechanism for proposed framework 5.1.
