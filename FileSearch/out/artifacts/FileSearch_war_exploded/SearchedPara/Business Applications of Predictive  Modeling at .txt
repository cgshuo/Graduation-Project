 Predictive modeling is the art of building statistical models that forecast probabilities and trends of future events. It has broad applications in industry across different domains. Some popular examples include user intention predictions, lead scoring, churn analysis, etc. In this tutorial, we will focus on the best practice of predictive modeling in the big data era and its applications in industry, with motivating exampl es across a range of business tasks and relevance products. We will start with an overview of how predictive modeling helps power and drive various key business use cases [5]. We will introduce the essential concepts and state of the art in building end-to-end predictive modeling solutions, and discuss the challe nges [6], key technologies, and lessons learned from our practice, including case studies of LinkedIn feed relevance [1-4] a nd a platform for email response prediction. Moreover, we will discuss some practical solutions of building predictive modeling pl atform to scale the modeling efforts for data scientists and an alysts, along with an overview of popular tools and platforms used across the industry. predictive modeling; business an alytics; machine learning; machine learning platforms This tutorial is suitable for resear chers, students, and practitioners of predictive modeling who are interested in the industry applications. Advanced techniques in data mi ning and statistical modeling are not required but some background in statistics and big data is expected. The tutorial consists of three ma in sections: an introduction, an overview of predictive modeling, and considerations when choosing a framework for predictive modeling. In the introduction, we will briefly survey the audience to better understand their goals and adap t the depth of information presented during the tutorial.
