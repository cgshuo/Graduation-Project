 What is the role of the internet in politics general and during cam-paigns in particular? And what is the role of large amounts of user data in all of this? In the 2008 and 2012 U.S. presidential cam-paigns the Democrats were far more successful than the Republi-cans in utilizing online media for mobilization, co-ordination and fundraising. Year over year, social media and the Internet plays a fundamental role in political campaigns. However, technical re-search in this area is still limited and fragmented. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers working at the intersec-tion of social network analysis, computational social science and political science, to share and discuss their ideas in a common fo-rum; and to inspire further developments in this growing, fascinat-ing field.

The web has often been regarded as a liberating, deliberative and democratizing place. Empirical research, however, has shown that while there are many new instruments for communication and par-ticipation, online politics are but a reflection of the offline politi-cal landscape [8]. Online data is increasingly recognized as a rich source of data for studies that normally fall in the domain of social sciences [13, 15, 18].

Politicians worldwide have realized the power that social media carries when it comes to campaigning. Here, Twitter and Facebook are often on the frontline as they engage many users in political virtual debates and, ultimately, mobilize them for grassroot move-ments. Online campaigning is generally thought to have played
The following workshop papers have been accepted for publica-tion and are presented by one of the authors.
 Tweets and Votes, a Special Relationship: The 2009 Federal Election in Germany : The paper examines the relationship between tweets and votes in the context of a recent German election, with a focus on the choice of parties, individuals and time periods which should be taken into account when one attempts Twitter-based elec-toral predictions [12].

Partisan Alignments and Political Polarization Online: A Com-putational Approach to Understanding the French and US Presi-dential Elections : The paper compares election campaigns in France and the United States with respect to political polarization and cit-izen engagement [7].

Multi-cycle forecasting of Congressional elections with social media : The paper examines the feasibility of predicting elections (for the US House of Representatives) based on social media data [9].
Ingmar Weber is a senior scientist at Qatar Computing Re-search Institute, Doha. His recent work focuses on how user-generated online data can be used to answer questions about society at large and the offline world in general. Ingmar was co-organizer of the  X  X olitics, Elections and Data X  (PLEAD) workshop at CIKM 2012, contributor to a WSDM 2013 tutorial on  X  X ata-driven Political Sci-ence X  and is co-editor of a Social Science Computing Review spe-cial issue on  X  X uantifying Politics Using Online Data X . He loves chocolate, enjoys participating in the occasional ultra-marathon/triathlon and tweets at @ingmarweber.

Ana-Maria Popescu is a research scientist consulting for early-stage social startups. Previously, she was a text mining scientist at Yahoo! Labs where she most recently worked on social media min-ing and user modeling; she co-led the Twitter analytics effort for the Yahoo! News Election 2012 coverage. She obtained her Ph.D. in 2007 from University of Washington with a thesis in information extraction from the Web.

Marco Pennacchiotti is an applied scientist and principal en-gineer at eBay, where he leads the science on social media. Be-fore joining eBay in June 2012, he was a research scientist at Ya-hoo! Labs, focusing on text mining, information extraction applied to big data and social media. At Yahoo!, he wrote papers focus-ing on user-profiling also applied to the political domain. Marco obtained a Ph.D. in natural language processing and information extraction in 2007 from the University of Rome, Italy. [1] A. Abramowitz, J. Campbell, R. Cook, M. Toner, D. Owen, [2] J. An, M.
