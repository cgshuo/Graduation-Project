 We present a knowledge discovery tool Search Excavator (SE) developed for detecting similar words in web docu-ments ranked by overall usage frequency in American En-glish. The SE prototype application is a web browser add-on developed to assist users in acquiring new knowledge in un-known domains and to help in posing more specific search queries. The SE is designed to discover similar but gener-ally infrequent words with surrounding texts in browser web documents and then suggest found words as possible query keywords. This technique allows users to discover unknown data intersections and use less ambiguous queries to target the required documents.

The SE concept is motivated by a number of ideas. The similar infrequent words in the texts of the relevant doc-uments can include field specific terms and facts that can be unknown to the user. Suggesting such keywords can de-crease the overall search time encouraging early learning by directing users to the new unknown relevant terms and facts in a search session with an ambiguous query.

Finally, we present four demonstration scenarios from our small-scale qualitative user study of the SE tool.
 H.3.3 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ]: Information Search and Retrieval Complex search; knowledge discovery; query suggestion; query formulation; query completion
The amount of data in the World Wide Web is grow-ing daily creating new challenges for the search engines and related knowledge discovery techniques to satisfy the user needs. There are many tricks in query formulation to reduce the search time and to obtain more relevant results in the first tries, but most of them are based on relevant previous knowledge in the area of the specific search undertaken.
However, these techniques provide little help when the user is completely unfamiliar with the domain or when the question to ask involves many diverse factors. Usually each of the documents should be studied intensively, as a result users often spend much time reading aggregated relevant documents trying to learn new domain specifics and discover yet unknown relevant information intersections. Current re-search is addressing the complex search problem ( complex search task , is a web search that requires many queries to be fulfilled) described by G. Singer et al. in [ 4] and is aimed to support users in discovering domain specific terms and facts in the aggregated relevant content. According to [ 4] some tools are needed to speedup the iterations of the aggrega-tion and discovery activities. Or in berrypicking model [ 1] representation, the idea is to make the path between queries shorter (see Figure 1).
 Figure 1: Berrypicking model of the SE technique idea
The SE is designed to extract similar but generally in-frequent words from the aggregated relevant documents and offer these words to the user within augmented interface ele-ments in the web search engines: Google, Yahoo!, Bing, and web encyclopedia Wikipedia. The SE collects plain text in-formation from the web pages opened by the user (browser tabs) and offers similar words ranked by overall word fre-quency in the 385+ million word Corpus of Contemporary American English [ 2] 1 .

The initial idea for the tool came from the personal search experience. With growing information overload users intu-itively use more topic specific keywords to better target the required documents. Users also try to select less frequent keywords to narrow down the search results. In case of an ambiguous query users can be assisted with automatic detec-
Word frequency data from the Corpus of Contem-porary American English (COCA) downloaded from http://www.wordfrequency.info (May 2012) tion of the topic specific words. Generally, infrequent words that have been found in relevant context can help users to adjust their search direction and to discover subtopic docu-ments they require.

For simplicity of the prototype the browser window is treated as a complex search session and any opened web page is treated as a relevant document for the corresponding search session assuming tabs with non-relevant documents have been closed. The infrequent words present in 50% or more documents (or at least in 5 documents in case of many tabs open) are treated as interesting and get passed to the ranking. Extracted infrequent words ranking is calculated based on the word overall frequency in [ 2] and word fre-quency in the texts.

The SE is aiming two tasks: 1) to help users discover sim-ilarities between documents (main task) and 2) to suggest users more topic specific keywords in case of an ambiguous query. For comparison, the existing query suggestion tech-niques are mostly based on the search logs and click-through data from millions of users. If we compare SE approach with the mentioned query suggestion techniques then SE operates on the ad-hoc search session snapshot consisting of the aggregated relevant documents which allows SE to support context based personalized query specialization[3 ] (literally, going from  X  X inear algebra overview X  to  X  X inear al-gebra overview orthonormal system X ).

The SE 2 is a prototype application that consists of the client 3 (Mozilla Firefox browser add-on) and server counter-parts. The overall structure and communication of the SE components are represented in Figure 2. The Mozilla Fire-fox browser add-on is tracking URLs of the active browser tabs and synchronizing this data with the SE server over http . The server is responsible for the web page text extrac-tion and word frequency analysis. The frequency analysis consists of three main steps: 1) removing stop words based on overall frequency and web lists, 2) searching for similar words in documents and 3) ranking (ordering) according to the amount of documents with the infrequent word, word overall frequency in language and word frequency in con-

The SE interface elements are injected into the search en-gine result pages (SERP). In order to help users to adopt the new technique, development was focused on the following: After the SE browser add-on installation, it will not require any extra actions. When a new browser instance is started the SE add-on tries to anonymously register the new search session on the SE server. If registration is successful the add-on starts URL synchronization and injection of the interface elements.

An example screenshot of the Google search engine web page with SE interface elements is shown on the Figure 3. The additional green color button on the right and drop-down lists are injected by the SE browser add-on. The central drop-down list contains common infrequent words from the three web documents located in the tabs not in fo-cus. The green color button has two main actions: request updated word list from the SE server on mouse click and show the drop-down list when the mouse is over the button. The infrequent word list synchronization is also running on the background. Automatic requests are checking the latest state on the SE server every 6 seconds. The SE server also sends partial results. In case of partial results the SE button will have a yellow color glow as an indicator.

Mouse click on any suggested keyword will append this word to the search query field. Mouse over action on any infrequent word will open two additional lists on the left and on the right containing selected infrequent word surround-ing text (see Figure 3). Users should start reading from the left list row then append selected keyword and finish read-ing with same level row from the right list. On the Figure 3 users can read  X ...the matrices that have an orthonormal sys-tem of eigenvectors th... X . Mouse over action on any row of surrounding text lists (left and right lists) highlights with green color and increases width of the corresponding tab. Other tabs that also contain selected keyword will be high-lighted with yellow color. Mouse click action on any of the surrounding texts will open corresponding tab and highlight suggested keyword inside the web page.
Demonstration scenarios consist of four search tasks. Each demo search task is designed to show certain aspect of the SE prototype. A small-scale qualitative user study was per-formed using the same demo search tasks with 5 respondents (university students and teaching staff). Each respondent was first educated with the SE usage demonstration on ex-ample search task. Then users were provided with the demo search tasks.
 This demo search task is introductory and aimed to show how SE helps users locate topic specific terms/aspects in the texts of the relevant documents. Without SE users need to locate documents describing linear algebra, read found articles and manually select five most specific terms from the texts (or, if lucky, find a web page describing similar search results, at the moment of writing the direct query  X  X ost used terms in linear algebra X  did not give satisfactory results). With SE this task is simplified to just locating the relevant documents and then inspecting the SE suggestions. User study showed that this demo search task was very dependent on the user X  X  search skills and experience.

The SE suggestions are directly dependent on the quality of the selected relevant documents. If documents describe only certain aspect of the linear algebra then the SE findings will also reflect only this aspect. During user studies search duration varied from short if the user finds descriptive doc-uments to long if the user is not able to find at least two documents extensively describing target topic. One of the respondents was familiar with the topic and evaluated the SE findings as valuable, but suggested to improve SE for finding phrases like  X  X rthonormal basis X  and  X  X rthonormal system X  instead of only  X  X rthonormal X .
 This demo task is aiming to show how SE facilitates knowl-edge discovery in the aggregated relevant context. Two wikipedia articles were provided for this task: 1) Cloud At-las 4 film article and 2) The Fountain 5 film article. This task is not dependent on user X  X  search skills as relevant docu-ments are already provided. All the respondents delivered results in 1-3 minutes. Mostly results were the same as all the repondents used the SE suggestions: 1) same critic re-view (Roger Ebert), 2) 10 minute ovation on film premiere, 3) same review aggregator website reports used in articles. Most interesting is the first discovery as this critic had pos-itive review for one film and negative review for another. This demo search task is designed to demonstrate how SE infrequent word suggestions are helping users in finding doc-
Task2, doc 1: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud Atlas (film)
Task2, doc 2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The Fountain uments similar to the context. If users are able to locate at least two highly relevant documents then SE suggests query keywords to find more. Users can use SE like the query ex-traction tool because it locates words from context that are generally infrequent and allows to target similar context.
Respondents were provided with two web documents de-scribing Azores (islands in the North Atlantic Ocean). The first document 6 is a small general overview of the Azores. The second document 7 described Azores as a good honey-moon destination. All respondents used the SE suggestions and delivered results in less than 2 minutes. All respondents were satisfied with the quality of the located documents. Two respondents notified that with help of each particular suggestion they were able to locate better and better quality documents.
 This demo search task is aimed to show that SE is personal-ized tool and helps users in making discoveries. During the user study, this search task had different search times and similarly to the first task it is dependent on user X  X  search experience. Several respondents had problems with locating relevant articles describing other people X  X  feedback for the place they would like to visit. However, three respondents were able to discover unknown interesting things with SE when some relevant content was aggregated.
We have presented a knowledge discovery tool developed for detecting similar and generally infrequent words in ac-tive web documents. By means of the demonstration we will go through several search sessions described in this paper and show the capability of the SE to detect domain specific terms, discover common unknown facts and locate more doc-uments similar to the relevant context. The SE application focuses user X  X  attention on the found similarities between documents in the relevant context facilitating early knowl-edge discovery.
