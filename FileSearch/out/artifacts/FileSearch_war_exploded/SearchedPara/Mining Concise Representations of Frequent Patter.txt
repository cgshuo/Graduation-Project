 The last years witnessed an explosive progress in network-ing, storage, and processing technologies resulting in an unprecedented amount of digitalization of data. There is hence a considerable need for tools or techniques to delve and efficiently discover valuable, non-obvious information from large databases. In this situation, Knowledge Discov-ery in Databases offers a complete process for the non-trivia l extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potential ly useful knowledge from data. Amongst its steps, data min-ing offers tools and techniques for such an extraction. Much research in data mining from large databases has focused on the discovery of association rules which are used to identif y relationships between sets of items in a database. The dis-covered association rules can be used in various tasks, such as depicting purchase dependencies, classification, medic al data analysis, etc. In practice however, the number of fre-quently occurring itemsets, used as a basis for rule deriva-tion, is very large, hampering their effective exploitation by the end-users. In this situation, a determined effort focuse d on defining manageably-sized sets of patterns, called conci se representations, from which redundant patterns can be re-generated. The purpose of such representations is to reduce the number of mined patterns to make them manageable by the end-users while preserving as much as possible the hidden and interesting information about data.
 Within the traditional association analysis, the conjunct ion connector  X  linking items  X  got the monopoly. This was motivated by the original application pertaining to market basket analysis. In this respect, a growing number of ap-proaches explored the conjunctive search space where items are characterized by the frequency of their simultaneous oc-currence ( or co-occurrence ) . The aim of such an exploration is to get out a lossless nucleus of itemsets, from which the remaining ones can be exactly derived. Many exact concise representations of frequent patterns were thus proposed in the literature. Among the numerous concise representation s, the ones based on closed itemsets and minimal generators ( aka minimal keys, free itemsets, key itemsets, and intent reducts ) got a large interest since their respective propos-als [1]. The representation based on closed itemsets heavil y relies on an operator which makes it possible mapping an important number of elements  X  from the frequent itemset search space  X  into a single element within that of frequent closed itemsets. On its side, the minimal generator-based representation takes advantage from its efficient computa-tion thanks to the interesting structural properties of the minimal generator set. In fact, these itemsets are closely linked. Indeed, once applied, the aforementioned opera-tor partitions the set of frequent itemsets into equivalenc e classes. Each class contains itemsets characterizing the s ame set of objects. These itemsets hence share the same closure obtained by intersecting the associated objects. The close d itemset is then the unique maximal set of items characteriz-ing a set of objects. While, often several minimal generators constitute the minimal elements of each class. The afore-mentioned link between closed patterns and minimal gen-erators explains why they are often simultaneously used for concisely representing pattern classes, like frequent ite msets, ( classification ) association rules, sequential patterns, etc. In this respect, the interesting structural properties of the min-imal generator set made it a key step for mining important pattern classes as well as for knowledge interpretation. In -deed, according to the minimum description length ( MDL ) principle, minimal generators are the preferred represent a-tion of an equivalence class in applications like model sele c-tion, classification, etc. Unfortunately, the number of min i-mal generators is usually larger than that of closed itemset s. This is explained by the fact that several minimal genera-tors cohabit in the same equivalence class and, hence, conve y the same information. An intra-class combinatorial redun-dancy would then logically results from the inherent absenc e of a unique minimal generator associated to a given closed itemset. Thus, a same piece of knowledge is redundantly conveyed by distinct minimal generators.
 This motivated us to carry out an in-depth study aiming at only retaining irreducible minimal generators in each equi v-alence class, and pruning the remaining ones without infor-mation loss. Our aim is thus to approach as much as possible the  X  X deal X  case which consists in only retaining a unique ir -reducible minimal generator per equivalence class. In this respect, we propose lossless reductions of the minimal gen-erator set thanks to a new substitution-based process that avoids the internal interchangeability of the minimal gene r-ators [2; 5]. This consists in localizing minimal generator s mutually reachable by permutation of their respective sub-sets. This allows to group them in finer equivalence classes, induced by a dedicated substitution operator . Then, only a representative in each class is retained, while the remain-ing ones are omitted since redundant. We then carry out a thorough study of the associated properties of the obtained families [2; 5]. Our theoretical results can be useful for th e different extensions and applications of minimal generator s or their similar constructs. In this thesis, they are applie d within the association rule framework in order to reduce as much as possible the number of retained rules without in-formation loss [2]. We then give a thorough formal study of the related inference mechanism allowing to derive all re -dundant association rules, starting from the retained ones . A new approach is then proposed, dedicated to the extrac-tion of a lossless subset of generic association rules based on redundancy-free minimal generators as a starting point [2] . In order to validate our approach, computing means for the new pattern families are presented together with empirical evidences about their relative sizes w.r.t. the entire sets of patterns.
 In the literature, other item links such as their complemen-tary/mutually occurrences  X  rather than item co-occurrenc es  X  were neglected and only some recent works highlight the added-value of this type of knowledge. Indeed, in practice the following situations can arise. Suppose that a market basket data is under treatment, and the manager is search-ing for items c 1 , c 2 , . . . , and c n whose selling implies that of at least one of two competitive products a and b ( or proba-bly both ) , i.e. , the items fulfilling the condition: c . . .  X  c n  X  a  X  b is always true. Such a rule conveys knowl-edge about the items sold simultaneously with a or b . Since the disjunction connector  X  is inclusive, the simultaneous selling of c i and c j ( i 6 = j ) is possible. On the other hand, in a textmining application related to text translation from a language l 1 to a language l 2 , an analyst may be interested in the possible translations in the language l 2 of a given term t belonging to the language l 1 . In this respect, t may have several translations tr 1 , tr 2 , . . . , and tr n in the language l according to its usage context. Thus, a rule like tr 1  X  tr . . .  X  tr n  X  t is interesting since it summarizes the possible translation of t . In both cases, more computations may be performed to get more precise information about the effect of a given product ( resp. terms ) among c i ( resp. t j ) on the appearance of a and b ( resp. t ) . Various other applications of disjunctive itemsets are possible in the contexts of soci al network analysis, bioinformatics, etc. In such situations , the disjunction connector linking items can bring key infor -mation as well as a summarizing method of the conveyed knowledge. Such knowledge may not be obtained even by a collection of conjunctive patterns.
 Due to the close link between frequent itemsets and associ-ation rules, it is more advantageous to mine a concise repre-sentation of frequent itemsets that offers direct access to t he disjunctive support of frequent itemsets. Such a represent a-tion can be used as a starting point for mining generalized rules ( i.e. , also involving disjunction and negation of items ) based on frequently occurring itemsets. In this respect, we initially focus on the unique representation in the literat ure exploring the disjunctive search space, namely that based o n essential itemsets . Being the equivalent of minimal gener-ators within the disjunctive search space, essential items ets bring interesting knowledge about the complementary occur-rence of items in a dataset. However, several essential item-sets can characterize the same set of objects. This motivate d us to propose a new disjunctive closure operator dedicated to the disjunctive search space to avoid such a redundancy [4]. This operator offers a redundancy-free representation of the disjunctive search space since it allows to select a uniq ue element  X  the maximal one  X  to represent itemsets covering the same set of data. It hence makes it possible the proposal of reduced exact concise representations of frequent items ets based on disjunctive closed itemsets [4]. This representation allows the efficient derivation of the different types of item-set supports, i.e. , conjunctive, disjunctive and negative. In addition, the proposed closure operator constitutes an in-teresting tool for the efficient exploration of the disjuncti ve search space. Such an exploration can be used for exam-ple towards the derivation of generalized association rules [3]. These latter rules generalize classic association rul es  X  positive rules  X  to also offer disjunction and negation con-nectors between items, in addition to the conjunctive one. The associated quality measures can thus be derived using a representation based on disjunctive itemsets [3]. In the li t-erature, generalized association rules are useful in differ ent applications. For example, they are used as an intermediate step for defining concise representations for frequent item -sets. They are also exploited to provide the end-users with some new forms of association rules. Dedicated tools were then designed and implemented for extracting disjunctive itemsets and generalized association rules. Our experimen ts showed the usefulness of our exploration and highlighted in -teresting compactness rates.
