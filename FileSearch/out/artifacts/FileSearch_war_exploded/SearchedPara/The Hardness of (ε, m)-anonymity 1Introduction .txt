 With the growing use of public services, privacy preservation attracts increasing attention publish its payment records in Table 1, called the microdata. Attribute Salary is sensitive, any employee.  X  X ge X  and  X  X ipcode X  are quasi-id entifier (QI) attributes, because they can be utilized in combination to reveal the identity of an individual. 
The proper measures must be taken to ensure that its publication does not endanger the privacy of the individuals that contributed the data. One way to overcome above was partitioned into QI-groups, and then converts the QI values in each group to the such an example by suppressing Table 1 based on a partition of three QI-groups. Assumes that each tuple in the group has an equal chance of being owned by Bob. 
Without further information, the adversary concludes that Bob X  X  salary is in the short anonymity, l -diversity, etc.) can effectively prevent such proximity breach. The paper[1] remedied the problem by introducing a novel principle called (  X  , m )-anonymity Let T be a microdata table that contains the private information of a set of individuals. represents its SA value.  X  , t.S +  X  ], where  X  is any non-negative value[1]. Definition 1. Given a real value  X  and an integer m &gt; 1, a generalized equivalence Definition 2 (Problem Definition) . Given a table T and two integer  X  , m, anonymize it diversity generalization if we set m = l . It is natural to wonder, in the more general case we establish the NP-hardness of star minimization, even when the size of maxi cover derivation is based on a reduction from a classical NP-hard problem 3-dimensional matching (3 DM ).  X  , solution S 0 can be { p 1 , p 3 , p 5 , p 6 }. the values in D 3 . We construct a microdata table T from S . Table 3 demonstrates the T built from the S , when m = 3. Lemma 1. The 3 DM on S returns yes, if and only if there is a (  X  , 3 ) anonymity gene-ralization of T . 
To extend the above analysis in a straightforward manner, we can show that, for through a reduction from m -dimensional matching. In this section, we discuss how to develop a good partitioning strategy for suppression of (  X  , m )-anonymity. The microdata T was first sorted in ascending order of their SA whether T j satisfy (  X  , m )-anonymity. 
To reduce information loss, we will partition the microdata following the steps: we lexicographical QI-attribute order, based on the attribute ordering. First, we consider attribute A 1 with the smallest domain size and put tuples with the same A 1 -value in the will participate the next round of partitioning. Otherwise, find a sub-table T x such that (  X  , m )-anonymity is satisfied by the merged partition T j  X  T x . If such a partition cannot be found, we merge T j with a random partition and merging continues until the result-ing partition satisfies (  X  , m )-anonymity(Step 7). tuples t 1 , t 2  X  G , | t 1 [ S ]-t 2 [ S ]|&gt;  X  and | G |  X  m .

The exist-published relation provides sufficient privacy protection. Numerous generalization principles have been developed. These include k -anonymity [2 X 4], l -diversity [11], t -generalized table under a generalization principle, which minimizes some quality metric. It has been shown [5] that computing the optimal generalized table is NP hard, even when a simple quality metric is deployed. 
The existing generalization algorithms can be further divided into heuristic and theoretical. The main advantage of heuristic algorithms is that they are general, name-ly, they can be applied to many anonymization principles. Greedy solutions have also bottom-up algorithms are presented in [6]. Incognito [8] borrows ideas from frequent item set mining, while Mondrian [9] takes a partitioning approach reminiscent of kd -trees. Authors of [13] are the first to establish the complexity of optimal k -anonymity, by showing that it is NP-hard to compute a k -anonymous table that contains the min-imum number of stars. Xiao[14] present the first theoretical study on the complexity and approximation algorithms of l -diversity. This section experimentally evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed technique. Our purposes are twofold. First, we illustrate that our generalization algo-rithm (presented in Section 3) produces (  X  , m )-anonymous tables that permit accurate Our machine runs on 1.9 GHz AMD Core CPU, and has 1 gigabytes memory. 
Our experimentation deploys a real database income frequently used in the literature, art technique: the splitting [1] algorithm( SP for short). We compare the usefulness of the data published by the two approaches, under the same privacy requirement. 
The first set of experiments studies the influence of m on data utility. Towards this, attribute. Concerning absolute (3000, m )-anonymity, Figure 1 plots the number of star as a function m . Both techniques incur more stars as m increases since a larger m de-mands stricter privacy preservation, which reduces data utility. Apparently, our algo-rithm produces more useful anonymized data than SP algorithm. Conversely, the number of star in SP algorithm deteriorates drastically as m increase to 8.

In this paper, we present the first theoret-ical study on the complexity, and the corresponding algorithm to implement it. Through our experiments, we showed that our approximation algorithms perform significantly better than traditional approximation algorithms.
