 It is well known that HorLing is the cl assic version of Gesar epic and the body of the tween spoken and written language . It broke through each dialect barriers and b e c a me a universal language. It is important to study the language , which have a restricted view for a n a tion X  s way of thinking and attitude of observ ing . 
Th is paper makes the following contributions: 1) make a q ualitative calculation r e-search on vowel sounds ; 2) calculate Tibetan theory characters by rule description and s oftware generat ion; 3) compare with the c onsonant and characters of Gesar epic, which helps master the language system of the epic ; 4) provide a reference data for Tibetan language research and Tibetan info r mation processing. Therefore, it is a very meaningful expe r iment. In ISO/IEC10646 "Tibetan coding B asic Collection " (hereinafter referred to as the " Basic Col lection ") , the Tibetan is coded according to the d ynamic superposition characteristic of Tibetan. It involves Tibetan consonant and component. There are 192 Code bits in Basic Collection , occupying 0F00 -0FBF area, 168 coding cons o nant s and component s , 24 v acant code s. In Unicode3.0 released in September 1999, 34 Tibetan component s and symbols w ere supplemented . No Tibetan consonant was supplemen t-ed in Unicode4.0 , but Tibetan coding space extend s to OFFF and contains total 256 code bits [1] .

According to the consonant, component and symbol in basic collection, we su r-veyed their distribution and frequency in Gesar epic. In Gesar "HorLing", the cons o-nant, component and symbol occurs 1387431 times and 68 types . There are 3 kinds of the code . E ach of them appear s 21 times . T he third one is initiative symbol and a p-pear s once. There are three p unctuation s , i.e., syllables, full stop and comma. Among them, syllable s occurs the most, i .e., 329814 times and 23.7716% of the HorLing total consonants . F ull stop follows, appear ing 30145 times and 2.1727% . T he third is comma , a total of 12602 times and a c counted for 0.9083%.

In addition to the symbols and punctuation, we also investigate d fou r Tibetan vo w-el s contained in " HorLing " . The frequencies of four vowels are all show n in Tibetan except vowel " a " , which is implied and from which we can understand the cause and focus of Tibetan voice. In the four vowel s , vowel "o" a p pears 63368 times , i .e., the highest frequency, accounted for 6.2442% of corpus amount (except the above pun c-tuation , which occurs 1014827 times co n sonant and component) . V owel " I " follows , appear ing 56968 times and accounted for 5.6136% of total corpus . The next is vowel " u " , appear ing 48105 times and 4.7402% of total corpus . V owel "e" is the final one , appear ing 46441 times and 4.5762% of the total corpus.
 In accordance with the order of traditional grammar, the order should be "i u e o" . B ut from the view point of frequency, the order is naturally "o i u e" . T he last vowel is adjusted to become the first one. In addition to the above four symbols, we X  X e seen do u ble -layer vowel " o " appear ing 22 times, accounted for 0.0022% . T he appearance sions .

In addition, reversed written vowel " I " appears once . I t is not a form of ancient T i-betan  X  s reversed written vowels, but the transcription of Sanskrit words by searching. In the sixth chapter of the first part of H or Ling , ChaoTong pretended to be King G e-are the n ame of the tree of life in S outh ZhanBu continent, which are loanwords and derived from Sanskrit . They are occasionally used in the Tibetan text, but rarely in spoken Tibetan . I t also suggests that Gesar epic language exists between spoken la n-guage and text, or Gesar epic language is an organic combination of text and sp o ken language. At the same time, th e reversed written vowel is not ancient Tibetan , which means Gesar epic language is the common language and do es not contain a lasted synchronic la n guage . I t may be one of the reasons for epic "Gesar" as the only "living epic" . The top ten are "  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  " except individual punctuation and vowel in Horling. "  X  " appears 84921 times, the highest frequency, accounted for 8.3680% of the corpus amount ( the corpus contains 1014827 times of consonant and component except sy l-lables and punctuatio n s ); "  X  " appears 72025 and account s for 7.0973% of the total amount of corpus . T o be sure, the fr e quency of "  X  " do es not include "  X  " as a root when combined by ko can and dok can . Frequency of root of "  X  " statistic separat e ly (the following consonant acing a s other similar function are the same). "  X  " appears 69418 times , account ed for 6.8404% of the total. "  X  " 63281 times, 6.2356%; "  X  " 48392 times, 4.7685%; "  X  " 48320 times, 4.7614%; "  X  " 46583 times, 4.5902%; "  X  " 45724 times, 4.5056%; "  X  " 40112 times, 3.9526%; At the end of the "  X  ", a total of 37850 times, close to 40000, account ed for 3.7297%.
 grammar, the result is very surprising. The traditional order of the ten words is "  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ", which is just the ten latter root of Tibetan character . Therefore , how could the latter root be high frequency consonant in consonant and component, and what is its primary cause? We will deeply discuss that later combined with cha r act er status.
Syllable, full stop and four vowels, 10 latter root, a total of 1 6 high -frequency c o n-sonant s and punctuation , and then is the superimposed consonants and other letters. pear 20773 times, account ed for 2.0469%, the frequency of which is below 20000 and more than 30000. The frequency of the third dok can is "  X  ", accounted for 0.8404%, significantly lower than the first two , less than 1% . Even so, "  X  " is not only dok can , appear 649 times, accounted for 0.0640%, which ranked 51 in frequency of 6 2 cons o-nants and components .

In addit ion, "  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  " has three ko can in Tibetan . U nfortunately, due to not taking traditional way for encoding, but making dok can as a key coding, statistics on fr e-quency of the three ko can cannot adopt the same method, which h ad to be o b serve d in the part of d iscussion of character . However, this encoding way provide d us an opportunity to research ko can combination roots . There are 16 ko can roots . 3 roots quency of "  X  " is 10831 times, 1.0673%; frequency of "  X  " is 8020 times, accounting for 0.7903% . "  X  " has talked about as ko can , h ere is mainly aimed at its root fun c tion, these three characters could act as common root for three ko can.

In co n clusion, there are 1387431 times of c onsonants, components and punctu a tion in "HorLing" of "Gesar" epic . There are 62 types of consonants and components e x-cept six punctuation, covering 1014827 consonants and components. W e could see that only 6 consonants appear in 15 vowel consonants of Hor ling according to Basic collection. In addition to once Sanskrit reversed written vowel, the rest can be consi d-ered to be Tibetan vowels, coverage of 100%. A ppeared in the top 10 are 10 latter used as ko can , but they cannot used as ko can roots. The diversity of the role make s them stand out in more than 1 million consonants and be come a top ten high freque n-cy c onsonants . More impressive is that the c umulative frequency of th ese 10 cons o-nants and 4 vowels achieved 76.0236%. That is to say, 1014827 co n sonants in the full text of Horling except syllables and punctuatio n , 76% of the 14 c onsonants were r e-peated and composed in the various roles. 
The highest level of the art is not to make the simple things complicated, but to d e-scribe the complicated things by the most simple and fluent language , a s is not only perfect combination of art and science. We could also make this question, of course, the characteristics of the phonetic writing is to realize complex expression by a few letter combinations. There is no doubt that it should be acknowledged. What make us surpris ing is that 30 letters of alphabet writing should only use 10 of them and reached 76% of expression . T his work is a miracle. 
In 168 coded consonants version of "Basic collection", t here has 77 consonant character s [ 3 ] , including Tibetan single consonant, 49 dok can root character , 28 Sa n-skrit consonant character and dok can characters. In the epic Gesar, statistics of co n-sonant and components of " HorLing" . T here are 49 pure Tibetan charac ter s except seven vowels and six Sanskrit characters . It shows that in the level of consonant and component, "Gesar" epic " HorLing " covers 100% of the modern Tibetan consonant and compo nent, effectively prove " HorLing" has important value as a template for Tibetan language research. stood as character, the statistics might not consider other factors. But the basic chara c-ter is put forward, which give s us a consideration and evolves  X  character  X  . For the Tibetan information technology , the problem of character were raised at the beginning of encoding for Tibetan.

In te rms of Chinese characters, a word can be classified as a character , such as 6763 Chinese characters were collected in GB 2312, including 3755 primary /first -level Chinese characters, 3008 secondary characters, which basic ly meet the requir e-ments of regular users of computer processing of Chinese characters, and its coverage to mainland China 99.75% of Chinese characters operating frequency. From which we can see that every word is a syllable unit, at the same time it is a character . For the Tibetan language, there is a big difference between character s , a syllable is not necessarily a character, a word at the same time sometimes could be a syllable. As mentioned above, a Tibetan syllable is consists of seven parts at most . Although it late single character and vowel, and vertical superposition ( ko c an , dok can ). 
W e need to know how many character in Tibetan, how many characters in volum i-nous ancient books and the epic ? Three categories and 33 ko can in Tibetan, four categories and 40, four vowels, 30 roots, these combined according to the rules of wo rd groups referred to as lus kyi yi e ,namely,body word or character.

In order to study Tibetan character, according to the theory of Tibetan voice, we made a rule description and generated in program. In this way, there are 454 Tibetan characters in the g enerating program. Including the transl a-tion of words:  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  , the three actually belong to the category of Sanskrit long vowels. them, the "  X   X  X  X  " character pronunciation should be "ja", it is a person  X  s name, suspected that the strokes weren X  X  c onnect well when sketching, character should be 498. Of course, there are also some superposition of latter root and plus latter root in the DunHuang literature and ancient Tibetan stone tablets, this part actually are sup erposed according to the need of writing space at that time. Ult i-voice except Non -standard writing .The 498 Tibetan character, like 400 no -tone basic Chinese syllable, which could be regarded as the foundation of the Tibetan voice systems or basic voice.
 three Sanskrit reversed character "  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  " in the 454 character s ,and add five new cha r-be 456. As the world  X  s longest epic "Gesar" ,how many basic voice use d when talking and singing , or how many characters for recording in Horling Part one and two? If we could make this clear, then we could understand the reality of the Tibetan voice sy s-tem probably.Based on this understanding, we counted the number of chara cters of "HorLing"part one and two, there are altogether 445 characters. epic, three translation character and the reversed -written vowel ancient Tibetan cha r-acter, and appear some Sanskrit categories , but the frequency of the Sanskrit is very low, just appear while recit ing om mani padme hung and ali  X  s four great rivers, and several animal and plant names such as "water lotus", "lion" etc . 34 Sanskrit and fr e-quency table (table 1) as follows: No . 2  X  X  X  30 0.0043 19  X  1 0.0001 69335 4  X  X  X  17 0.0025 21  X  1 0.0001 69335 7  X  7 0.0010 24  X  X  X  1 0.0001 69335 9  X  5 0.0007 26  X  X  X  1 0.0001 69335 10  X  5 0.0007 27  X  X  X  1 0.0001 69335 17  X  X  X  2 0.0003 34  X  1 0.0001 69335
As you can see, in 34 Sanskrit character , a total of 17 character appear twice or more, the rest is only appear one time. The highest frequency i n Sanskrit is "  X  X  X  ", a total of 142 times, in fact the character and its co mbination are both "  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ", it is a character with different form of "  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ( hero)". 
We already know that the number of modern Tibetan character is 456, which a p-pear 411 times in "HorLing", there are still 45 Tibetan character does not appear, and Horling character accounted for 90.1316% in modern Tibetan characters , there are nearly 10% of the them has not been covered. If some high -frequency character did not appear, then typica lity of the HorLing language will be questioned. Therefore, we need to know which character does not appear, and the function of those does not a ppear . Through comparison and selection, we found that the 40 characters are : "  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X   X  X  X  X  X  X  not commonly used , and even some c ould be called "death character ", never u sed, such as "  X  X  " [ 8 ] . 
The interpretation to meaning item of each character and function of character building , we query to the 30 text file of "reference corpus", total size is 4.11 MB, 2.15 million characters. In which 32 words never appear; the highest frequency appear 99 characters , belongs to the ancient Tibetan "  X  X  X  (people)", following is 6 times, 3 times, one time . 
It shows that the 40 character is not commonly used , most of them never appear in the 2 million corpus . The ancient Tibetan accounted f or the proportion , in addition to the individual character, most is uncommon character . Therefore, it is reasonable that they did not appear in HorLing , because the characteristics of HorLing language is very popular, a universal language. character , there are two statements . O ne is the five characters are new combination according to the need of translation after liberation , to translate some " f " consonant such as " Leifeng " , " plane " and " Mei lanfang " should adpot five characters ; Another is that these five characters has been used in the period of the fifth dalai lama ( the early qing dynasty ). Anyway, the characters might be created lately from the situation of non -appear in Ho ling corpus.T here is no this kind of pronunciation in the folk oral Tibetan . Moreover, so far, there hasn X  X  local characters formed by these characters except translation need, related basic voice replaced with pa and pha, no " f " cons o nants or initials words . 
We already know that 411 characters in "HorLing " accounted for 90.1316% of modern Tibetan characters , also include some Sanskrit common used characters , to a Sansk rit exists in Tibetan regularly ,t herefore, it is necessary to taken into account of level, it also reflects the Tibetan is a universal buddhist nation and it has the ve ry deep influence as the birthplace of Buddhism .

T he top ten high frequency character are "  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  " in the epic , we are very latter roots if we reorder these ten characters, that is, "  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  X  ". 
We know that the total frequency the character is 693356 times, th e cumulative frequency of top 10 character is 39 1069 times, 56.4023% of the total number of cha r-acters . Detailed in the following table (table 2) : 
N o . charac ter times frequency  X  %  X  cumulative 1  X  53669 7.7405 53669 7.7405 693356 2  X  48251 6.9591 101920 14.6995 693356 3  X  46848 6.7567 148768 21.4562 693356 4  X  44149 6.3674 192917 27.82 37 693356 5  X  44031 6.3504 236948 34.1741 693356 6  X  34726 5.0084 271674 39.1825 693356 7  X  34056 4.9118 305730 44.0942 693356 8  X  31894 4.5999 337624 48.6942 6 93356 9  X  27888 4.0222 365512 52.7164 693356 10  X  25557 3.6860 391069 56.4023 693356 and "  X  " same as characters stati stics layout, and then change on the ordinal, but on the whole, still the 10 character s. 
In the top 100 chracters , mainly is function word , such as five the auxiliary case are in the top 50. They are, "  X  X  X  " ranks 12th, appear 10408 times, frequency is 1.5011 %; "  X  X  X  " in the 18th, 5054 times, the frequency is 0.7289%; "  X  X  X  " in the 33th , 3171 times, fr e-2417 times , frequency is 0.3486%. The frequency of ordering shows that it is obvious for the adhesion phenomenon ( function word cohere with national word) of the case.
The cumulative frequency of the first 100 characters is up to 625379 words, a c-counted for 89.94% of total corpus, the lowest frequency is 945 times . T he 100 cha r-act ers appear 1033 times except the end of the last three characters. S o they can be called thousand -times character . 
From the number of 101to 200, character root has taken main status. The highest Which is relatively balanced, unlike the frequency of the first 100 characters , the first appeared 53669 times, and 100th appear 945 times, they are differ more than 52000 times . 
The cumulative frequency of th e first 200 characte r s is up to 675826 times , a c-counted for 97.47% of the total number. From the number of 101 to 200 , mostly is superposition character, followed by consonant and vowel , illustrate the major co m-ponent of Tibetan alphabet combination in this frequency. The cha racter without s u-perposition and vowel is only one "  X  " , its number is 107, still in the first place, appear 872 times , frequency is 0.1258%. 
T he frequency and distribution of 447 characters shows that the reflects the usage and distribution of Tibetan cha racters in epic, on the other hand it also reflects a ge n-eral situation of the entire Tibetan character. All 447 characters including Sanskrit, there are 29 of which frequency is only once, 10 of which frequency is 2, seven of which frequency is 3, five of which frequency is 4, three of which frequency is 6, only one of which frequency is 7, two of which frequency is 8, there of which frequency is 9, t wo of which frequency is 10, there of which frequency is 11, there of which fr e-quency is 12, there of which frequency is 13. As you can see from these frequency , 2 -3 characters distribut ed for each level in low -frequency ones equably. T hroughout the 447 character s , there are 115 characters which frequency are below 30 .The rest 33 Sanskrit except "  X  X  X  " are mixed In this frequency channel. It can be seen that the cha r-a c ter of this frequenc y channel is not " uncommon character ". "HorLing", commonly known as "HorLing wars " or " the war of HorLing " , mainly describes the war events between tribe of Hore and Lin g , shows the changes of the Tibetan tribal society. Mr Qian mintz wrote in his article: "HorLing wars is a histor i-cal picture scroll of Tibetan hero  X  s grand, majestic and grand, it is permeated with enthusiasm upward, positive enterprising and fight passio n. This is very similar to the Iliad" [ 9 ] He also asserts that "Tibetan HorLing wars is the Chinese nation  X  s "Il i-ad" " [ 10 ] .

It is earlier to study of A D ream of R ed M ansions by corpus method, which i n-spired us for the first time to study Gesar epic by establ ish ing Tibetan tagging corpus. Though t he study we not only get the number of Tibetan theory character , but also verified the frequency of character in the practical application, and classifi ed the cha r-acters . Moreover , we verified the 40 low -frequency cha racter s in a larger range (2 million characters) the verification of the corpus to further confirm the reliability of the frequency of characters in "HorLing " , it makes sense.
