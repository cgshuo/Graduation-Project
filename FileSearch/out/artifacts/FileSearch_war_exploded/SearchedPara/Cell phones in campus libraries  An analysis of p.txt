 1. Introduction
Library science studies abound which examine how individuals have come to utilize the prolific technolo-gies that have been increasingly available at academic libraries. Concern has also been focused on the response of libraries as they have migrated from a system of automation to one of digitalization (See Saracevic &amp; Dal-bello, 2001, for a review ). Users can now access a wide array of information-seeking technologies not only at the library, but also from remote locations, including their homes, offices or dormitories. However, it appears that a topic yet to be explored is the phenomena of individuals bringing their own mediated technologies into the libraries themselves. This is an interesting phenomenon from many perspectives, not the least of which is how technology importation affects the professional practice of librarianship. In part this is because the rapid ascent of mobile telephones has been accompanied by their increasing use in spaces that had traditionally been thought of as being inappropriate for the conduct of loud personal conversation and jarring noise of generated by ringing devices ( Katz, 2004 ). The intrusiveness of mobile phones has received much spontaneous negative comment, which has been extended to contemplative domains such as houses of worship and libraries.
This study examines how libraries within college and university settings in the United States have dealt with the influx of patron mobile telephone use. We contacted 150 colleges and universities throughout the United States and received 87 responses. These institutions were ranked by US News and World Report in their 2006
Edition of  X  X  America X  X  Best Colleges ; X  X  we sampled from their list stratified within the following categories: sities; X  X  and  X  X  X ourth tier national universities. X  X  We found that those college and university libraries adopt an array of stances when approaching cell phone use within their library facilities. These approaches include structured guidelines which specifically address cell phone use posted on the library website, signs displayed throughout the library barring cell phone use, and signage that provides patrons with a list of areas in which use is permitted. Interestingly, we found that several libraries lack any kind of mobile phone policy and instead, assume all patrons will behave in a proper way. This paper outlines the many guidelines that libraries implement when approaching mobile telephone use and many of the results and feedback that libraries have derived as a result of these policies. 2. Literature review 2.1. Mobile telephone use in public arenas
Thirty years ago, the idea of seeing a male or a female carrying on a telephone conversation in public was unfathomable. Today, it is not uncommon to overhear tales of one X  X  perils while sitting on a train or even walking down the street. The mobile telephone has allowed us to rethink our conceptions of social norms and what is permissible in public arenas ( Ling, 1997; Ling, 2004 ). As Ling cites, many of us have seen or heard individuals using cell phones in places ranging from  X  X  X rt galleries to toilet stalls X  X  ( Ling, 1997, p. 2 ). Mobile phones have come to infiltrate almost every component of contemporary life. Such integrations of public and private space have left many of us questioning and reevaluating social norms and boundaries ( Ling, 1997 ). For example, Ling found that 60% of mobile phone users, verses 76% of nonusers agreed or  X  X  X ended to agree X  X  with the statement that  X  X  X he mobile phone disturbs other people X  X  ( Ling, 2004, p. 123 ). Clearly, there is a disparity plaguing these two parties and an aching for an understanding of just how  X  X  X ntrusive X  X  mobile telephones have become, and more importantly, how intrusive we should allow them to be.

To be sure, mobile telephones have come to alter our ways of looking at everyday life. For example, Ling (1997) examined perceptions of cell phone use in restaurants. Much like buses, trains, parks, museums, the-atres and many more public realms, restaurants are  X  X  X imultaneously public and private spaces X  X  ( Ling, 2004, p. 125 ). While there can hardly be an expectation of absolute privacy, individuals come to  X  X  X laim ter-ritory and (agree) upon illusory perimeters, or  X  X ymbolic fences X  X  X  when occupying a seat on a bus or on a park bench ( Ling, 2004, p. 125 ). In other words, we claim our space and establish boundaries regarding how much or little we allow others to intrude upon this space. With these boundaries come expectations regarding eti-quette and norms that govern how we should act in these spaces. As Ling, explains, restaurants have pre-scribed norms for etiquette; individuals are primarily aware of what utensils should be used when and what restaurants should be attended during a first, second or third date. All of these rituals can be explained through Goffman X  X  theories on the presentation of self; we know where we are, what it means to be there and what  X  X  X ace X  X  we should put on in this space ( Ling, 1997, 2004 ). However, new technologies and situations present different circumstances in which individuals can present different faces. The library for example has traditionally been noted as being a place of privacy and quiet. However, as will be discussed in subsequent sections of this paper, many college libraries have been witnessing increasing levels of mobile phone use.
As Ling (1997) describes in his study of perceptions of mobile telephone use in restaurants, individuals find the practice perturbing for several reasons, among them are that of the ringing sound that incoming calls make and  X  X  X oud talk X  X  (p. 10). As will be discussed later, these are two common manifestations of cell phone use that college libraries have come to address. Ling found that respondents were  X  X  X rritated X  X  by the sound that results from individuals talking on the phone; one respondent indicated that  X  X  X eople talk loud on telephones. Louder than usual at least. That is as annoying as having a loud party next to your table X  X  (Ling, p. 10). As Ling explains, this violates the territory of the restaurant and  X  X  X akes it difficult to maintain the face X  X  (p. 10). In other words, individuals are effectively removed from their setting in which they are supposed to feel relaxed and comfortable. Ling X  X  respondents also indicated that the harsh ringing of a telephone is as jarring a sound as waking up to one X  X  alarm clock in the morning. In other words,  X  X  X he ring-ring of the phone disturbs the mood X  X  (p. 10). 2.2. Mobile technologies in the library
The very nature of mobile phones with their abrupt ringing and potential for loud conversation can argu-ably have a similar effect on patrons who are expecting privacy and peace. Whether the credit should be given to the media or to parents trying to advise their children of good manners, one has traditionally been likely to view the library as a place of silence; where if one were to speak in a tone louder than a slight whisper, he or she would not only receive a stern look of warning from other patrons, but also an audible  X  X  X hh!! X  X  from librar-ians. Similar to how talking is viewed as reprehensible in movie theaters, analogous social norms exist in libraries. (As an illustration, there is a well-established image, and cultural trope, of librarians  X  X  X hushing X  X  mildly disruptive patrons). However, the rapid diffusion of mobile technologies has called into question the applicability and adherence to traditional public social norms ( Rice &amp; Katz, 2003 ). Currently, there are about 2 billion mobile phone users worldwide, meaning that every third person has a cell phone ( Shilov, 2005 ). With the explosion of mobile technologies have come the establishment and occasionally, the restructuring of social norms to meet them. Signs and announcements reminding one to  X  X  X ilence X  X  his or her cell phone can be seen and heard from within one X  X  physician X  X  office to the cinema ( Rice &amp; Katz, 2003 ).

While there have been studies of norms and manners as affected by mobile phones in restaurants and some other public areas, it appears that none have been conducted in terms of mobile telephone use within libraries.
As noted above, considerable research has been devoted to the effects of digital technologies on search routines in libraries. Research appears lacking however, regarding how library patrons utilize technologies that they themselves might bring into the library. To shed light on this area, one in which there is likely to be continuing intensification of activity, we surveyed a small sample of libraries at colleges and universities to understand their policies and how they might vary by extrinsic factors such as location or academic ranking. 3. Methodology
We contacted 150 colleges and universities throughout the United States via email. The institutions we con-best national universities; and fourth tier national universities as ranked by US News and World Report X  X 
America X  X  Best Colleges . We contacted a sample of 30 of the top public universities, 30 of the top liberal arts col-universities. Because the bottom tier schools were not numerically ranked (the top tier schools were), but rather listed in alphabetical order, we used a random digit generation program to ensure that each school had an equal opportunity to be interviewed. During December 2005 and January, February and March of 2006, we contacted via email the above identified schools asking them about their policies for cell phone use (if any). 4. Findings
Our emails to 150 institutions yielded 87 responses. We received responses from 20 public universities, 17 from the top liberal arts colleges, 14 of the bottom tier liberal arts colleges, 13 of the top national universities and 23 of the bottom tier national universities. Based on the responses we received, we found that academic libraries have widely varying policies (including none) to address mobile telephone within their facilities. To illustrate, 26 schools indicated that they had signs placed within the library which advancing principles of mobile telephone etiquette, had a limited ban concerning use in certain areas, prohibit use of loud ringers and excessively loud voices, or ban utilization completely. We also found that 35 libraries make mention of cell phone policies on their website, while 10 schools indicated that they utilize a combination of website policy listing and signage within the library. Six schools reported that they had written text in either the form of a manual or simply a written reference for librarians and patrons that delineates mobile telephone policies, and 10 schools reported being devoid of any type of policy (see Table 1 ). 5. Web-based policy guidelines
Though the above mentioned numerical data is useful, we found the personal anecdotes and perceptions of mobile telephone were also highly illuminating. For example, Ann Gwinn Zawistoski, Reference and Instruc-tion Librarian at the Gould Library at Carleton College (personal communication, January 13, 2005), which is ranked as being the fifth prestigious liberal arts school in the country, reported that the library website pro-vides guidelines regarding cell phone use. As stated on Carleton X  X  library website,  X  X  X ell phones that are not switched off X  X  are barred from being brought into the library. However, Zawistoski noted  X  X  X peaking on a cell phone is almost never prohibited X  X  unless the user is speaking in an excessively loud voice, or one that would be considered to be loud during an ordinary face-to-face interaction (personal communication, January 13, 2006).

As Anne Garrison, Head of Reference Services and Humanities at Swarthmore College indicated (personal communication, January 12, 2005) the Swarthmore College library makes mention of mobile telephone use on its website and in doing so, discourages  X  X  X iscourteous or disruptive use of cell phones or audio equipment. X  X 
However, the library supplements its policy by using humor to reprimand students who are not accommodat-ing to its policies; librarians are equipped with small cards to distribute to disruptive users which ask them in a comical way to  X  X  X ake their call outside X  X  (Anne Garrison, personal communication, January 12, 2005). Seem-ingly, such practices are in place so as to remove the discomfort that a librarian may experience when asking a student to take their call elsewhere. (For example, Stephanie Hartman, representing the Barker Engineering
Library at MIT indicated that the library created larger signs because the smaller ones they had been using signs were not achieving adequate compliance levels and  X  X  X taff didnot feel comfortable telling people to leave the library to take calls X  X  (personal communication, January 18, 2005). 6. Manual/written guidelines
As discussed previously, ten libraries indicated that they devised written manuals which address the topic of cell phone use. Such written policies include mention of how unnecessary use of mobile telephones is prohibited. Additionally, such manuals encourage users to migrate to public spaces when using their mobile telephones. Further, several of these written policies encourage those being disturbed to approach the cell phone user.
In large part, these written manuals urged both the user and the non user to be responsible library patrons; whereby one would be required to use his or her cell phone responsibly or, ensure that others were doing so. 7. The regulation of mobile use via signage
Notably, some institutions have online policies that address cell phone use and which usually fall under the category of  X  X  X se and Conduct Policies. X  X  However, many libraries reinforce these rules by having signs posted throughout the library which serve to remind students where cell phone use is prohibited. Dale Limbert (per-sonal communication, January 11, 2005) explained how Cleveland State University utilizes signs that prohibit mobile telephone habits that disrupt library use in any way. Williams College for example, solely looks to sign-age to ensure  X  X  X ood cell phone etiquette X  X  and asks individuals to turn off their cell phone ringers and only engage in mobile conversations in public pay phone areas (Robin Ohm, personal communication, January 11, 2005). Exactly how students react to such signs varies from library to library. For example, at the Mas-sachusetts Institute of Technology, five different libraries comprise the library system. Most of the libraries within the library system utilize signage to enforce courteous mobile telephone policies, that which includes not engaging in  X  X  X xcessive noise X  X   X  X  X rom cell phone activity X  X  ( Gass et al., 2004, p. 3 ). However, several librar-ians noted that students frequently ignore signs barring mobile phone use, thus warranting further promptings by the librarians. Mary George, Senior Reference Librarian at the Princeton University Library noted similar findings in that despite signs barring mobile phone use, there are in fact occurrences of persistent ringing (Mary George, personal communication, December 16, 2005). However, the librarian noted that the students receiving the calls frequently leave communal study areas to answer their phones in more noise-friendly areas.
In this sense, mobile phone users at the Princeton University Library are policing their use to a significant extent. Further, Anita Perkins a librarian at Dewey Library, one of the divisional libraries at MIT, noted that if students are using their mobile telephones in a distracting manner, other patrons  X  X  X emedy the situation X  X  (Anita Perkins, personal communication, January 11, 2005). In other words, if individuals are speaking loudly on their cell phone, other students reprimand the offender. Dawn Smith, Acting Assistant Director of Public
Services at Florida Atlantic University X  X  library (personal communication, January 12, 2005) indicated similar experiences in that the library previously had signage requesting that people either turn off their cell phones or place them on vibrate mode. Notably, however, library staff found that cell phones were ringing more fre-quently, leading to increased patron complaints about cell phones (Dawn Smith, personal communication,
January 12, 2005). The library subsequently decided to remove the signs and thereafter found that both cell phone use and patron complaints subsided. Additionally, Smith indicated that students do an adequate job of  X  X  X olicing X  X  one another X  X  cell phone use (Dawn Smith, personal communication, January 12, 2005). In general, such policies have met various levels of success and notably, have even encouraged students to take action. 8. The use of signage in conjunction with web-based policy
In attempt to regulate the use of mobile telephones within their libraries, many librarians indicated that they have guidelines posted online regarding mobile telephone use and have supplemented these written pol-icies with signs visible in various sections of the library. Judith Nagata, a librarian from Amherst College indi-cated that the library X  X  online behavior policy mentions mobile telephone use, but that there are also signs posted on the front door of the library requesting that patrons turn off their cell phone ringers. Additionally,
Nagata relayed that librarians also personally ask patrons to  X  X  X ake long cell phone conversations into the stairwells or outside the building X  X  (Judith Nagata, January 12, 2006). Florida Atlantic University also incor-porates the use of both online policy and signage. The library X  X  online policy prohibits  X  X  X oud conversations among library users X  X  including cell phones and advises students that those who engage in such disruptive con-versation may be asked to  X  X  X eave the premises X  X  (Dawn Smith, personal communication, January 12, 2006). Smith indicated that the library had in the past used signs to bolster the effectiveness of the online guideline.
However, she indicated that the library had experienced  X  X  X ore cell phones going off and patron X  X  complaints X  X  when the signs were posted. She says that since the signs have been removed, the  X  X  X atrons tend to police them-selves pretty well X  X  (Dawn Smith, personal communication, January 12, 2006). As mentioned previously, this theme of  X  X  X elf-policing X  X  and peer pressure seems to have a significant effect on how both users and non-users conduct themselves in situations that are perhaps not intensely regulated by signs or the librarians themselves. 9. No adopted mobile phone policy
While many schools acknowledge cell phone use and in doing so, create policies to address it, other schools do not feel the compulsion to do so. For example, Jean Ferguson (personal communication, December 15, 2005) at Duke University explained how the libraries have not found that excessive or loud mobile phone conversations are prevalent and thus, cellular phone policies have not been enacted. In fact, Ferguson reported that the Provost has mandated that all parts of campus be cell phone accessible for safety reasons. In order to facilitate this goal, Ferguson reported that she expected that  X  X  X epeaters X  X  would be placed throughout the cam-pus so as to create better cellular signals. Also, the Ohio State University library system reported that there has been some acknowledgement that mobile phone technologies can be in fact used to enhance delivery services (anonymous, personal communication, February 15, 2006). Haverford College indicated that they have yet to develop a formal cell phone policy. As Norm Medeiros (personal communication, January 12, 2005) repre-senting the Haverford Library indicated, its lack of a mobile telephone policy can be attributed to the fact that such a need simply not arisen. This lack of need is judged by the fact that the library has yet to  X  X  X ield any complaints from patrons. X  X  Again, peer pressure may be another culprit as student-to-student influence was also acknowledged as being a reason why some institutions have not incorporated cell phone policies into their library guidelines. 10. Conclusions/implications
Many libraries have already taken preemptive measures to curtail disruptive mobile telephone use by devel-oping both formal and informal policies regarding use. As mobile technologies become increasingly pervasive, and their functions more powerful, we will likely see libraries creating additional mobile telephone policies and altering existing ones.

This study demonstrates that in addition to a range of mobile phone policies, their levels of enforcement run a gamut of strictness and locus of enforcement (from library staff enforcement to the expectation that patrons themselves will enforce regulations). As discussed previously, we found that schools adopted the fol-lowing policies when tackling the issue of mobile phone use: policy posted online/library website only; signage only; both online posting and signage; written policy in library operating manual and no policy.

Interestingly, this study delved into a popular concept in mobile telephony: the use of cell phones in public spaces. Many libraries allow cell phones to be utilized in areas that have been traditionally thought to be places where individuals can engage in normal face-to-face interactions. Most of the schools that adopt this stance enforce it by placing signs in highly populated areas such as at the entrance of the library, in group study areas, lobbies and the entrance to the stacks. Librarians indicated that areas such as group study lounges, lobby areas, stairwells, computer areas, phone booth areas and cafes are some of the places that mobile telephone conversations were permitted. These locations are notable in that they are those in which face-to-face conversations have been traditionally permitted. Betty Febo, a library representative from the
Wellesley College library reported that they have integrated a policy that asks mobile phone users to limit their use to a  X  X  X elephone alcove X  X  near the lobby, the telephone/fax/copier area and enclosed stairwells (Betty Febo, personal communication, January 12, 2005). Such a policy implies that areas not included in the aforemen-tioned list are all acceptable places to use mobile phones and was reported by Febo as being adequate. The
University of Wisconsin at Madison also allows for mobile phone use in areas traditionally considered to be  X  X  X alking areas X  X  (Carry Kruse, personal communication, January 11, 2005). Such areas include group study areas and  X  X  X alking-allowed areas. X  X  Kruse indicated that her library has traditionally been viewed as being a  X  X  X un X  X  library as its group study areas  X  X  X re buzzing all kinds of activity X  X  and contain liberal policies in general with regard to library behaviors such as consuming beverages for example (personal communication, January 11, 2005). Mary Axford, representing the Georgia Tech Library and Information Center, indicated that her library had previously banned cell phone use altogether but currently allows use on group study floors while prohibiting it in quiet study areas (personal communication, January 11, 2005). Texas Woman X  X  University adopts a similar policy whereby mobile telephones must be placed in silent mode within  X  X  X uiet study areas X  X  thus implying that one can engage in traditional mobile phone operation when not residing in such areas (Connie Maxwell, personal communication, January 23, 2005). Northern Arizona University utilizes a similar policy whereby mobile phone users are permitted to use their devices in areas  X  X  X here normal conversation is permitted; X  X  otherwise, cellular phones and pagers must be in the  X  X  X uietest mode possible X  X  such as  X  X  X ibrating rather than beeping X  X  or with  X  X  X ingers at the lowest possible levels X  X  (Martha Portree, personal communication,
January 24, 2005). Thus, these policies address mobile telephone use in the same manner in which the library would confront excessively loud, face-to-face conversations.
However, what we found most telling were the narratives that librarians utilized when discussing their library X  X  perspective on cell phone use. Several libraries have instituted clever methods aiming to ensure respectful mobile phone use without arousing patron anger. One library, for example, took to distributing humorous cards to patrons. Also, some librarians noted that their policies should be updated or even insti-tuted for the first time due to increasing levels of mobile phone use. The University of Southern Mississippi posts signs in public areas banning excessive noise due to cell phone use but does not as of yet, have a policy posted on its web page. However, Kay Wall representing the university (personal communication, January 11, 2005) indicated that this study has prompted the library to post the document on their  X  X  X olicies X  X  page. Inter-estingly, Betty Febo at Wellesley College (personal communication, January 12, 2005) also indicated that per-haps her library X  X  policy was outdated and that this study has given them the opportunity to update it. For example, one librarian from a Southern institution indicated that her library did not have a mobile phone pol-icy, noting that she wished that they did. In that sense, it may be that a modest but surprising result of this survey is that our research may actually promote and rationalize the development of cell phone policies in libraries and thus can serve as a policy establishment guideline.

The phenomenon of mobile telephone use is a relatively recent one. Thus, it can be expected that as user practices change and libraries evaluated best practices, we will surely see policy changes devised to meet the needs of the patrons; both the user and the non-user.
